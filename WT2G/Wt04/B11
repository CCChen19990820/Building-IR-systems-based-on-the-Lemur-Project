DEUTSCHE TELEKOM BOASTS OF 16.4 MILLION CABLE TV SUBSCRIBERS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Deutsche Telekom announced on October 21 that 16.4 million homes were
connected to its cable television network as of September 30. The leading
cable operator in Germany, Deutsche Telekom has gained 571,000 new
customers since the beginning of the year. The number of cable ready
households has also increased since January, to 24.7 million in Germany as
a whole (compared to 24.2 million at the beginning of the year). As of
late September, 66.1% of German households were ready for connection to
the cable network, compared to 64,7% in early 1996. Of this proportion,
66.3% were actually subscribing, according to Deutsche Telekom. At the
current rate, 95% of the telecommunications network will be digitized by
the end of the year, the company further noted.

MOBISTAR RECORDS 20,000 SUBSCRIBERS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Mobistar, a Belgian company, in which France Telecom has the controlling
stake, now has a total of 20,000 subscribers six weeks after its launch
date. This news was announced by the company management on October 22,
during the official opening of this, the second Belgian mobile telephone
network. In the month of September alone, the company had a list of 10,000
subscribers and the advertising campaign had not even got underway, says
Bernard Ghillebaert, who is hoping to have 40,000 subscribers by the end
of the year. Proximus was brought into service nearly two years ago. In
order to be able to operate the network, Mobistar had to pay the Belgian
authorities a fee of FEB 9 billion (FF1.5 billion or USD300 million). The
network installation costs are put at FEB 6 billion (FF one million or
USD200 million). Mobistar is one of the few foreign companies in which
France Telecom has a share of more than 50%. We generally get established
with a local partner by taking a stake in the region of 30%, said France
Telecom's Chairman, Michel Bon, who attended Mobistar's opening ceremony
in Brussels. France Telecom's consolidated turnover in the foreign mobile
telephone sector is put at FF 700 million. The trading figures amount to
1.4 billion if minority shares are taken into account. The French business
is hoping to double its sales in this sector in 1997. When Mobistar was
launched, last August 27, its rates were 35% cheaper than Proximus's.
Three days after, the Belgian operator announced a sizeable cut in rates
to be able to compete with the newcomer. France Telecom has a 57% stake in
Mobistar, Telinfo of Belgium 10% and a group of Belgian investors 33%.
Mobistar covers 95% of the Belgian population and 58% of the Belgian
territory.

EUTELSAT OPEN NEW HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The new headquarters of the European satellite telecommunications
organisation, EUTELSAT, was officially opened on October 22, in Paris by
Jean Grenier, its Managing Director. The opening ceremony was attended by
Francois Fillon, the French Minister for Postal Services,
Telecommunications and Space. Ever since the organisation was created, in
1977, its headquarters have comprised four floors in the Tour
Montparnasse. It is now moving to a brand new building (9,000 square
meres,) built on 2,200 m2 of land (belonging to the City of Paris) on the
edge of the Andre-Citroen park. Nearly 300 people of 18 different
nationalities are now employed there to help in the task of running
EUTELSAT's fleet. Come November 13 the organisation will be launching the
Hot Bird-2 satellite, which is set to come into service in early December.
It will be positioned 13 degrees longitude east, alongside Hot Bird-1 and
EUTELSAT-II-F1. Mr Grenier says TV programmes (accounting for 70% of
EUTELSAT's turnover) transmitted by the organisation's satellites may
currently be received (by aerial or cable) by a bit more than 60 million
households in Europe (500,000 in France). Minister Fillon hailed the
success of EUTELSAT, which is now handling more than 160 channels,
including 40 digital ones. In reference to the requirement for all EU
Member States to open up their telecommunications industries by January 1,
1998, he said he could not but hail EUTELSAT's strategic options and its
aspiration to provide satellite coverage that far transcends the borders
of its member countries so as to be able to operate on a global scale in
due course.

ITALY TO PRIVATISE STET IN FEBRUARY/MARCH

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

STET, Italy's Government-owned telecommunications group is set to be
privatised as planned in February/March 1997, European Commissioner Karel
van Miert for Competition announced on October 4, on the sidelines of a
competition and antitrust conference staged in Rome. If Italy loses the
opportunity to privatise STETwithin the prescribed period, between
February and March next year, it might have to wait until the end of 1997
for an other suitable period, according to the Commissioner. Brussels is
said to be awaiting a signal from the Italian Government about the
privatisation programme. The Commissioner also came out in favour of a
six-month extension to the agreement between the Government-owned group
IRI (one of STET's shareholders) and the European Commission, rather than
the one year period sought by the Italian authorities. Under the terms of
the agreement, IRI has to cut its debt to L 4,500-5,000 billion (roughly
USD2.9 to 3.3 billion) by the end of 1996. IRI has been unable to stick to
the undertaking owing to the hold up with the privatisation drive. The
Commissioner also spoke about the Commission decision to open an inquiry
into the funding of L 1,500 billion being earmarked for the IRI in 1997 to
compensate for the group's financing activities for the Alitalia airline.
We have to examine this operation to see if state aid is involved, said
the Commissioner.

PHILIPS AND FLAT SCREENS ALLIANCE

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The Dutch electronics giant, Philips, is planning to join forces with the
Japanese group Hosiden from Osaka (central Japan) in the flat screens
sector using AMLCD liquid crystals technology. Philips has declined to
reveal the amount of money being invested into this future joint venture
in which both groups will have an equal stake. The cooperation will also
involve technoloogical exchange contracts and agreements for the sales of
goods using the AMLCD technology. Philips sees the cooperation with the
Japanese group as an opportunity to take advantage of Hosiden's leading
position in this field and to allow the Dutch group easier access to the
Japanese equipment industry. Philips has a flat screens technology
facility in Eindhoven, in the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dutch
group is unable to say yet how the deal with Hosiden will affect the 580
jobs at the Eindhoven plant. Worth USD4.6 billion in 1995, the AMLCD flat
screens market is set to almost triple by the year 2001, according to
Philips. AMLCD technology may be used for the manufacture of portable
computers, miniature TV sets and car navigation systems.

Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM), the Italian public mobile telephone company,
has announced that it has 4.9 million subscribers. This figure includes
subscribers to the TACS analog system as well as to the European standard
GSM system. TIM claims to have 1.1 million subscribers to its GSM
services, or 70% of Italian subscribers to this standard. The company
reached a point of equilibrium in the GSM sector in June, TIM's Managing
Director, Massimo Sarmi, said.

UNILOG'S NET PROFITS DOWN 11.42% IN FIRST HALF 1996

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Unilog, a consulting and computer engineering firm, announced on October
22 that its net consolidated profits were 11.42% lower for the first half
of 1996, at 12.4 million French Francs, than the 14 million Francs
recorded a year earlier. Total after tax turnover rose by 3.74% during the
same period, to 378.458 million FF, compared to 364.819 in 1995. For 1996,
consolidated turnover is expected to increase by about 10% due to a new
60/40 distribution of turnover between Paris and the other French regions,
where Unilog has expanded. The group undertook two operations involving
external expansion: the takeover of two agencies of the Easys Informatique
company (part of the Sinorg group) focusing on the industrial and banking
sectors (turnover of 20 million FF) and seven computer engineering
agencies of Alcatel TITN Answare (with 138 million FF in turnover). Unilog
has also acquired new capabilities in the areas of industrial
computerization and telecommunications, thereby preparing for the
transition to the Euro and the 21st century, the group said in a statement.

MANNESMANN MOBILFUNK CHEAPER THAN DEUTSCHE TELEKOM

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which operates D2, the second largest digital mobile
telephone network in Germany, announced on October 15 plans to cut its
rates at the end of October to below those of its public competitor,
Deutsche Telekom's D1. Less than ten days after Deutsche Telekom promised
a new lower rate to take effect on November 4, Mannesmann Mobilfunk
counterattacked, indicating that it would establish two new rates that
would be lower than its current rates, but only to customers who
subscribed for at least 24 months. The basic subscription (D2Fun 24) costs
24.95 DM, compared to 29 DM for Deutsche Telekom's Telly D1 Eco service.
The old version of D2 Fun 24 cost 49.90 DM. The cost of a new subscription
for private customers is "equivalent to that of a subscription to
conventional non mobile services", Mannesmann Mobilfunk emphasised. For
commercial customers (whose service is known as D2 Classic 24), the price
per minute for calls between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. will fall below the
psychological threshold of one DM to 0.99 DM, from the current 1.29 DM,
the group's statement said. Service on the D1 network costs 1,14 DM per
minute between these times. Mannesmann is also more flexible concerning
eligibility for the new low rates than Deutsche Telekom, which required
the subscriber to have been signed up for at least a year.

"Mannesmann Mobilfunk will propose the lower rates to its customers after
they have subscribed for three months", said the statement. There will be
a lump sum charge of 99 or 199 DM. Customers using D2 for more than two
years may switch at no cost. Mannesmann Mobilfunk is controlled by the
Mannesmann industrial group (65,2%) and AirTouch of the United States.
With more than 2.2 million subscribers in October, D2 leads the German
market, ahead of D1 (with two million customers). Germany has two other
mobile telephone networks, C Tel from Deutsche Telekom, a pioneering
network now losing momentum due to outdated analogue technology and E
Plus, which is growing slowly because it does not yet serve all of
Germany. A fourth network is scheduled to begin operating in May 1997. The
VIAG group (active in energy and packaging), which wants to diversify into
telecommunications, and British Telecom have both applied to operate this
network. The German Government will announce its choice in early February
1997.

LAST LAP FOR DEUTSCHE TELEKOM PRIVATISATION SCHEME

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The biggest privatisation drive in Germany's history entered its final
phase, on October 4, with the notification that 20% of the shares in the
telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom were on offer to the public.
Anxious to make a success of its stock exchange flotation, the group is
planning to pay out DM 1.5 billion in dividends in 1996 and 3 billion in
1997. Although they will be on sale in November, the shares will be
entitled to a payment in full for the year 1996. "This is the first time a
company entering the stock exchange has forecast the dividend for two
financial years, according to Joachim Kroeske, the group's Financial
Manager.

Deutsche Telekom is planning to place on the stock market up to 500
million new shares with a nominal value of DM 5. In the event of
oversubscription, there would also be an option for 75 million shares at
DM 5 each. A further 30 million shares have been earmarked for employees.
The share dividend should therefore amount to roughly DM 0.60 in 1996 and
1.20 in 1997. The price bracket was to be announced on October 22. The
bookbuilding system of sales involves a kind of auction with a fixed range
so as to favour the best offers. Deutsche Telekom is hoping to raise
roughly DM 15 billion with this partial privatisation, which leads
financial analysts to predict a price of between DM 25 and 30 per share.

The publicly offered shares subscription programme, one of the world's
biggest ever, is set to end on November 14. The price will be set on
November 16 in the light of the demands. On the morrow, Deutsche Telekom
shares will be quoted on stock exchanges in Germany as well as on Wall
Street and the New York Stock Exchange. A quotation is also on the cards
in Tokyo, London, Toronto and Quebec. In spite of its important
partnership with France Telecom, the German giant has not sought a
quotation on Paris exchange.

As well as attracting foreign investors, Deutsche Telekom is also keen on
appealing to small savers in Germany. This will be a new departure in
Germany, where there no more than 4.5 million shareholders in a country
with 81 million inhabitants. In order to attract German investors, the
group has persuaded the banks to ensure concessional commissions for small
savers. A loyalty bonus is being offered in the form of one free share for
every 10 held by small shareholders who keep their securities for three
years. All the major Germany banks are involved in the investment
consortium After the publicly offered shares subscription, the State will
still own roughly 80% of the capital base, which it plans to sell of in
stages between now and 1999.

BIGGER BT INPUT IN ALLIANCE WITH VIAG

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

In its bid to make a breakthrough in the telecommunications sector, VIAG,
the German energy and packaging group, is going to be able to count on a
stronger commitment from its UK partner, British Telecom (BT). In an
interview on October 15 with the Germany stock exchange daily, the
Boersen-Zeitung, the Chairman of the VIAG Management Board, Georg
Obermeier, said that under the terms of the two-sided plan, BT is going to
commit itself more to the operating side of the exercise. BT is set to
play a pivotal role with its technological expertise in telephone
switchboards. This specialist knowledge is going to be the cornerstone of
VIAG's plan for the German telecommunications market, which is to be fully
deregulated early in 1998. VIAG is banking on of parts of the terrestrial
network being linked with mobile telephone frequencies so as to allow, for
example, just one telephone number to be used.

VIAG has no experience at all of this sector so will be mainly in charge
of the marketing aspects of the plan. This is a new departure for our
group, as it has so far kept out of consumer goods activities. Marketing
will play a key role in this context, stressed Mr Obermeier. Last week the
latter has to resign himself to seeing the planned alliance with BT and
the Essen energy group, RWE, come to nought. According to the German
newspaper, the VIAG official kept on hoping right to the very last minute
that RWE would stick with the cooperation plan, in spite of running into a
rough patch in the talks opened last February on the basis of a letter of
intention. Because of RWE, certain options have not been taken up,
lamented Mr Obermeier. He claims that VIAG and BT would be taking step
between now and the New Year to determine the exact form their cooperation
would take so as to complement the activities of their joint offshoot in
Germany, VIAG Interkom. A key component of the BT/VIAG strategy is
obtaining a licence to run the fourth digital mobile telephone network in
Germany. Mr Obermeier is convinced the Government will pick the BT/VIAG
consortium in early 1997.

Mr Obermeier was one of those who predicted that the mobile telephone
industry bid fair to take off in a big way, but he admits the golden age
is over. We will need more than trading figures to earn money, he told the
newspaper. He thinks that the three digital networks already in place are
likely to run into capacity problems, though, thus leaving plenty of space
for his network.

ALCATEL/ALSTHOM: FF400 MILLION SHORTFALL

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Alcatel/Alsthom logged a net loss of FF 400 million in the first half of
1996. This compares with 1.2 billion in the same period last year,
according to Serge Tchuruk the group's Chairman. Apparently, these results
are perfectly in tune with the market programme, reflecting recent trends
and the still limited effects of the recovery plan embarked upon. The
improvement in the group's situation is attributed in the main to a
reduction in taxes and the better results achieved by companies under the
equity method. The group claims the recovery programme's even bigger
impact in the second half of the year points to a return to a balanced
situation for the whole of 1996. The group's turnover stands at FF 74.3
billion, down 3.4% on first half of 1995. Orders are nonetheless on the
wax in all sectors, reaching FF 81.5 billion in the first six months with
particularly strong growth in the telecommunications division.
Alcatel/Alsthom says half of the FF 10 billion assets transfer programme
has been achieved and the programme is due to be finalised in the coming
months, thus helping to make a substantial cut in the debt ratio. The aim
of achieving 7 billion worth of savings across the board by 1998 is still
in view. More than 20,0000 job cuts have been made or announced since the
middle of last year.

MINOR REVOLUTION IN FRENCH TELEPHONE INDUSTRY

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The French telephone system has undergone a minor revolution: the
10-figure numbering system became a reality on October 18, 11 pm local
time, pending the major revolution, early in 1998, when the national
network is due to be opened up to competition from private operators. The
change affects the 32.5 million telephone subscribers who have been using
eight-figure numbers since 1985. The new system has been introduced to
enable the national network to cope with the veritable explosion in
services (fax, stationary and mobile telephones, for example) for which a
million new numbers will have to be created each year. The eight-figure
system allows for 60 million different combinations but the 10-figure
numbers have the potential to create 470 million, and thus cater for the
anticipated needs between now and the year 2050. In the countdown to
Euro-wide deregulation in 1998, France Telecom is joining forces with
American Sprint and Deutsche Telekom of Germany to create Global One, an
entity offering telephone services to businesses. It is hoped Global One
will help FT fend off some of the competition from other
telecommunications giants when national barriers come tumbling down in
Europe. The main rivals are expected to be the UK's BT, which has signed
an agreement with the French group Cegetel, whilst the Bouyges group, a
newcomer on the telephone scene, has formed a partnership with STET of
Italy.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: PROGRESS ON CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The member countries of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development) have recently made progress towards the establishment of
international guidelines for policy on cryptography, i.e., the encoding of
computerised data. Drafting of the text is expected to be completed by the
end of the year. These guideliens could then be adopted by governments and
applied by enterprises, private citizens and law enforcement authorities
to ensure protection of transactions, communications and electronic
information storage.

The OECD guidelines define issues that countries must address when
developing cryptography policy at national and international level. Tehy
could play an important role in the development of the global information
infrastructure (GII) and the global information society (GIS). National
policies must be harmonised at international level to meet the needs of
global technologies and applications. Discussions have focused on users'
rights to choose methods of encryption, the freedom of the market to
develop these methods, interoperability, the consequences for protection
of privacy and personal information, freedom of access to encoded
information and the reduction of obstacles to international trade.

Non binding recommendations

The OECD guidelines will take the form of non binding recommendations to
the government of its member countries. In other words, they will not be
incorporated into international law and will not endorse any particular
encryption system. At a recent meeting, more than 100 representatives of
OECD member countries participated in debates chaired by Norman Reaburn of
the Australian Department of Justice. Officials from Ministries of Trade,
Industry and Foreign Affairs, Commissioners responsible for data
protection and other officials involved with safeguarding privacy attended
the meeting, along with representatives of law enforcement and public
safety bodies. Representatives of the private sector from many countries
were also present. The BIAC (the OECD's Business and Industry Advisory
Committee) was involved with the entire process of drafting the guidelines
and experts on protection of privacy and personal data, as well as
consumers, were also asked to contribute to the discussions.

Work on the guidelines began in March, when the OECD set up an ad hoc
group of experts composed of representatives of governments and OECD
country experts. This group met in Washington in May and again in Paris in
June. Its third meeting took place on September 26 and 27 in Paris. The
group will continue its negotiations during the week of December 16, with
the goal of completing, by the end of the year, draft guidelines to be
submitted to the OECD Council for its approval in early 1997.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: FORUM ON FUTURE OF MOBILE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The functioning of pocket satellite telephones into the 21st century was
the central topic of a Forum held in Geneva between October 21 and 23, and
attended by a thousand delegates from 126 countries and 250 company
representatives. Staged by the International Telecommunications Union
(ITU), the Forum on "Global mobile personal communications by satellite"
(GMPCS), was intended to goad both governments and industry to draw up
unique and globally compatible standards for this new telecommunications
technology.

This new technology extends not only to telephones but also to computers,
faxes and all mobile terminals used to communicate. It will be mainly
based on rings of satellites in low and medium orbit. Such satellites
appear to move in relation to the earth, unlike geo-stationary satellites
in high orbit which, seen from the ground, appear motionless.

Opening the Forum, ITU Secretary General Pekka Tarjanne, author of a
report used as a basis for the discussions, emphasised the "historic"
nature of the gathering. His report highlighted the Forum's "primary task"
in "defining a set of non-binding principles" which will necessarily be a
compromise. These principles will, according to Mr Tarjanne, need to
respect the "sovereign right of States to regulate telecommunications in
the framework of national policies". However, they will also need to take
account of "demands form systems operators and suppliers of GMPCS services
for open, fair and competitive access to national markets, through
transparent and non-discriminatory regulations".

Meanwhile, fourteen companies representing the industries involved in the
sector, have submitted a joint document to the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), declaring their support for "a comprehensive global agreement on
access to the satellite services market". These operators claim that a
single geo-stationary satellite costing several hundreds of millions of
dollars can replace five billion dollars-worth of terrestrial
infrastructure (cable, fibre optics etc.). While it would take more than a
century to extend terrestrial infrastructures across the entire globe,
they claim that satellites offer a cheap and rapid means of extending
telecommunications to isolated and poor regions.

Given that each individual nation will have to approve the proposed
services, satellite operators insist "the multilateral approach of the WTO
is the best alternative". They add that it is vital to "harmonise national
frequency allocations with those of other countries". For satellites to be
used worldwide, they must be accessible on the same range of frequencies
in all the countries they serve". The joint document was signed by Comsat,
Final Analysis, Globalstar, Hughes, ICO Global, Inmarsat, Iridium,
Lockheed Martin, MCHI, Motorola, Orion, PanAmSat, Teledesic and TRW.

ITU DEBATE ON "CALL BACK" SERVICES

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Geneva, has urged its
members to deliberate among themselves on one of the most controversial
issues currently facing telecommunications: "call-back" services. These
services send international calls via private operators abroad, most
commonly in the United States where prices are among the cheapest in the
world. Anxious that such services shouldn't be sold to countries where
they are banned, the ITU Council insisted on October 11 that "countries
must respect each another's national statutes". The ITU will re-examine
requests for a total ban on such practices in 1997.

The system substantially reduces the cost of calls for subscribers, but
purloins revenue from national telephone companies. "Call back" services
are expanding rapidly and currently represent a turnover of 500 million
dollars a year. The ITU believes this figure will top USD1.2 billion by
1998. Some 25 countries have thus far banned such services, according to
the ITU. In these countries, telephone companies, which are for the most
part monopolies, believe their interests are being harmed by this
opportunistic activity which continues oblivious to the cost burden of
maintaining the public telephone network. In the United States, where
tariffs are particularly low, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
authorises call-back services, although American operators are prohibited
from offering them in countries where regulations don't mirror the US
model.

Japanese companies specialising in international telecommunications
recently called for call-back services to be banned on the grounds of
unfair competition.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: MANOEUVRING IN EUROPE AS JANUARY 1 1998 DEADLINE
APPROACHES

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

European countries are preparing for the opening to competition of the EU
telecommunications market from January 1 1998, by gradually privatising
public operators, striking international alliances and deregulating mobile
telephony markets. Several countries have secured or requested extensions
to the deadline set down in Community Directives (notably Portugal and
Ireland), while others (Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have
already installed almost entirely deregulated markets.

In Germany, Deutsche Telekom is to float 20% of company capital on the
stock market in mid-November, with the remainder sold-off in stages up to
1999. The deregulation of the German market, the largest in Europe, has
sharpened the appetite of the country's leading industrial groups: RWE
(energy) and Veba (energy) have joined forces with the British company
Cable and Wireless, while Viag (energy, packaging) has struck an alliance
with British Telecom (BT). Mannesmann has secured access to the German
railways' terrestrial telecommunications network. Digital mobile telephony
is being fought over by Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann MobilFunk, with a
third licence due to granted at the beginning of 1997: Viag and BT have
submitted a joint application.

In France, the autumn has proven fertile, with two new telecommunications
poles launched: the first, Cegetel, has been constituted by the Generale
des Eaux -allied with British Telecom, Mannesmann and the American company
SBC-, the second unites the Bouygues group with the Italian operator STET.
Bouygues and the Generale des Eaux already have a stake in the
telecommunications sector through their mobile networks which compete with
France Telecom. The public operator is to start down the road to
privatisation in the spring, with the sale of a first 20% share of company
capital.

The United Kingdom is among the group of trail blazing countries. BT was
privatised in 1984, and the traditional fixed telephony market has been
gradually deregulated since 1989. The two leading operators are BT and
Mercury (Cable and Wireless), although BT remains dominant with 80% of the
market, compared with 10% for its challenger. BT recently lowered prices
by 25%, complying with the recommendations of the industry regulator
OFTEL, which continues to frame prices.

In Belgium, the public operator Belgacom was partially privatised in
December, with an international consortium led by the Americans Ameritech,
(along with Singapore Telecom and Tele Denmark) acquiring a 49.9% stake in
the company. Belgacom is not at present quoted on the stock market, but
this eventuality hasn't been ruled out. While Belgacom retains its
monopoly over fixed telephony, the mobile market was opened to competition
in this summer: Belgacom Mobile now has a competitor in Mobistar, launched
by France Telecom and the Belgian company Telinfo.

In the Netherlands, telecommunications have been privatised for a year in
the form of KPN, a holding in which the State has a 48% stake, the
remainder being traded on the stock market. The competing private
operators are mainly American owned. Consumers have a free choice of
operator, but KPN currently remains the most competitive on local calls
and communications with neighbouring countries.

In Spain, Telefonica remains a semi-public group (20% in State hands, the
remainder in public hands), with a hard core of shareholders made up of
banks and savings banks. The conservative Government has scheduled total
privatisation for 1997. Telefonica retains a monopoly on the fixed network
but has lost its dominance over mobile communications with the arrival of
the Airtel consortium, a partnership of the Americans Air Touch, Spanish
savings banks and banks, and BT with 5%. Telefonica hasn't struck any
alliances with other European groups and is focusing development
activities on Latin America.

In Portugal, the State share in Portugal Telecom has been reduced to 51%,
following two stages of privatisation. A date for the third and final
phase, covering the introduction of a strategic partner, has still to be
fixed. Telefonica in known to have expressed in its neighbour, while
France Telecom is "following the dossier".

CALL FOR PROPOSALS IN CONTEXT OF INFO 2000 PROGRAMME

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The European Commission has renewed its call for proposals for the
implementation of one of the lines of action of the Community "INFO 2000"
programme: it concerns the transfer of intellectual property rights in the
multimedia sector (line 3.2). A multi-annual programme, INFO 2000 is
intended to promote the development of a European multimedia content
industry. One aspect covered by this programme is the negotiation of
intellectual property rights. The administration of these rights is
traditionally organised by sector (text, sound, images, video, etc.). The
time and effort employed in the identification and acquisition of rights
is rising sharply as the number of forms of data, and of countries in
which right-holders reside increase. In this context, and on the eve of
the multimedia era, efficient and cost-effective mechanisms for
negotiating multimedia rights have become indispensable.

The call for proposals covers the selection of experts who will provide
technical support in this field to the European Commission services in
Luxembourg. The deadline for submissions is December 2 1996.

Further details on this call can be obtained before November 20 from DG
XIII-E-1, fax (352)43 013 79. Contact: J.Hoorens, DG XIII-E-2, tel.
(352)43 013 25 60, fax (352)43 013 31 90.

VISITS TO THE NIPPON STEEL RESEARCH LABORATORIES IN
JAPAN

Summarizes (June 1994) visits to two of Nippon's Steels
premier research laboratories: Steel Research; and
Advance Materials and Technology Research.  The main
focus of the visits involved titanium,
titanium-aluminide, and carbon-based materials
development at Nippon Steel, all areas in which Nippon
Steel is trying to develop new products and markets.
In particular, Nippon Steel has been somewhat
successful in marketing Ti as a structural and
functional material in new non-aerospace markets such
as construction and consumer goods.  They have also
placed emphasis on the automotive markets, but so far
have met only limited success.  Their penetration into
the high performance aerospace Ti alloys markets has
been very limited.  R&D efforts in new self-lubricating
materials and functionally gradient materials
technologies are also reviewed.

KOREA'S CENTER FOR ADVANCED AEROSPACE MATERIALS

Summarizes (June 1994) discussions held with members of
Korea's newly organized Center for Advanced Aerospace
Materials, which is supported by the Korea Science and
Engineering Foundation.  Although the majority of
projects fall under the broad category of aerospace
materials, some work is also aimed at the application
of traditional aerospace materials to automotive and
other applications.  The largest effort is based on Al
alloys, such as the 7000 series, Al-Li alloys, and  Rs-
Al alloys.  Of note is a high-strength and weldable Mn-
modified Al-Zn-Mg alloy that is being developed for
commercialization.  Other work includes elemental
PM-based gamma Ti-Al alloys, AIN fibers, whiskers and
foams produced by SHS, and theoretical advancements in
SPF.

Summarizes a (May 1994) visit to NKK's Materials and
Processing Research Center (Kawasaki, Japan in May
1994), in order to discuss their activities in the R&D
of advanced materials.  Emphasis is placed on three
general areas: (1) SP-700, a promising new
superplastically formable Ti alloy having an attractive
balance of properties and formability; (2) a new
titanium aluminide alloy for aerospace and automotive
applications, having a dramatically improved balance of
room temperature strength and ductility, and
process/product development efforts for automotive
applications; and (3) process development and
production of a magnetic steel sheet alloy with 6.5%
Si, which is a dramatic increase in Si over
conventional Si sheet alloys, which leads to improved
electromagnetic properties.  The high Si sheet steel is
produced on a commercial scale using a novel CVD
reaction and diffusion process.

JAPANESE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE STRENGTH OF
MATERIALS

This conference
(in Sendai, Japan, Aug. 21-26, 1994) provided an
excellent snapshot of the current understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms of the deformation and failure
of crystalline materials.  One of the more provocative
papers was presented by Prof. Vitek concerning a model
linking brittle intergranular fracture caused by the
structure of segregated grain boundaries in alloys, and
the grain boundary structures in intermetallics.
Several interesting papers of an empirical nature were
also presented, including: reviews of nano-laminated
materials; high-strength, ductility, and stiffness
quasicrystalline Al-based alloys; and a comprehensive
review of superplastically formable fine-grained
ceramics.

VISIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING AT
THE TOKYO INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

The visitor was given a brief overview (in Sep. 1994)
by Prof. Matsuo.  Following that overview, the visitor
gave a brief seminar on microstructure/property
relationships in gamma TiAl alloys to several members
of the faculty and a handful of graduate students.
Discussions were held with Prof. Takeyama on phase
stability and transformations of several intermetallic
alloy systems, including gamma TiAI.  Since coming to
TIT, Prof. Takeyama has broadened his research to
include microstructure/property effects, with emphasis
on the fixed effect of static heat treatments on
microstructure and properties, while continuing his
research on the effect of ternary additions to the
phase stability of near-gamma alloys.  The majority of
the phase stability work on Ti-A-X systems has been
where X is Cr, Nb, V or Mo.  Of potential commercial
significance is Prof. Takeyama's work on air cooling
and rapid quenching from the single phase alpha region,
followed by tempering or aging.  He has demonstrated
that it is possible to use quench and tempering
treatments to refine the as-cast structure, thus
improving the room temperature strength and ductility
over typical coarse cast microstructures.

DEFENSE CONVERSION IS AN OPTION, BUT IT WILL NOT
HEAL WOUNDS OF CONTRACTION, EXECUTIVES ARGUE

        Successful diversification into new commercial markets is
possible for defense contractors, but it will never make up for
the loss of jobs and revenue stemming from nearly a decade of
defense cutbacks.
        That was the consensus among three top executives of the
defense/aerospace industry at last week's Global Air & Space 94
International Business Forum and Exhibition, in Arlington, Va.
        The executives who expressed these views were: Richard D.
Brandes, senior vice president of GM Hughes Electrics; Sam Araki,
executive vice president of Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.; and
Peter Teets, president of the space group for Martin Marietta
Corp.
        Successful defense conversion on any scale requires time,
patience and a federal government that understands the challenges
defense firms face as the industry continues to contract, they
said.
        "Our entry into commercial markets did not happen
overnight," said Brandes. "It has taken about thirty years to
establish our position in what was unchartered territory for us."
        Hughes Electronics' voyage into the commercial marketplace
began shortly after the defense electronics firm launched its
first geosynchronous satellite for the U.S. government in 1963.
Shortly thereafter, Hughes entered the commercial satellite
business, which today brings in about $2 billion each year for
the company.
        At last week's defense business forum, Hughes made no secret
of its interest in commercial markets with a massive tele-visual
exhibit of its projects in satellite-based communications markets
such as DirecTV, which will offer hundreds of channel options for
homeviewers.
        "Some of these markets could develop into larger businesses,
but there is no way to make up for the losses we continue to face
in [defense-related] downsizing," said Brandes.
        He added that successful conversion cannot happen within the
confines of existing defense industry structures. While many
commercial technologies may have spun out of defense-related
applications, Brandes says it is critically important to create
new business structures within parent firms that focus solely on
commercial markets.
        Lockheed's Araki agreed with Brandes. Though Lockheed has
aggressively entered the commercial space markets of remote
sensing and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology, so far it
has fallen far short of making up for its 50 percent decrease in
size over the past decade.
        Araki said that space/defense contractors must do a better
job of marketing their technologies and making sure that space-
based technologies get the same attention that defense spin-offs
have. "The Clinton administration has not treated space with as
much advocacy as it has other technology industries," he
contends.
        "If we [as a country] do not address these issues, the space
industry will never again be as dominant in the global
marketplace as it was during the Cold War."

NORTHERN TELECOM TO TRANSFER $330M WORTH OF WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY

        Moving aggressively into a market that could reach $3
billion by 1996. Northern Telecom Ltd. (NT) last week announced a
$330 million agreement to provide digital wireless telephone
services in Mexico.
        According to Frank McNally, Washington, D.C.-based spokesman
for NT, this marks the largest technology transfer ever for the
company's wireless business.
        David Twyver, president of NT's wireless systems group, said
sales from his division could shoot up to $1 billion next year as
the company takes advantage of the growing market for wireless
telephone services in developing countries and the demand for
cheaper mobile phone service in the U.S.
        In just the last two months, NT has signed wireless
agreements with the countries of Uzbekistan, Columbia, and
Finland. The Toronto-based telecom firm is currently negotiating
an agreement with Ionica of the United Kingdom.
        With few telephone lines in many developing countries,
digital wireless access technology offers an inexpensive way to
get telephone service to remote areas. According to Twyver,
copper lines cost around $1,200-$1,300 per subscriber and can run
as high as $2,000. For wireless access service, the cost is under
$1,000 per subscriber.

SUPER BATTERY?

        Bolder Technologies Corp., of Wheat Ridge, Colo., last week
announced it will get $100,000 from the Advanced Research
Projects Agency to develop a battery with a cell size of 30 amp
hours. The Thin Metal Technology battery could be used for
electric cars, hybrid vehicles and lawn mowers. If initial tests
are successful, Bolder hopes to gain an additional $750,000 from
ARPA to fund pilot production.

ENVIRONMENTAL TECH TRANSFER.

        The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) will open an
environmental technology center in Osaka, Japan this month to
help transfer environmentally sound technologies between East
Asian countries. According to Elizabeth Dowdsdell, agency
director, "UNEP would like to see the [center] evolve as a
proactive intermediator between sources and users of
environmentally sound technology by systematically building up the
capacity of developing countries to choose, digest and utilize
these technologies." The program will focus primarily on enviro-
management in big cities.

DON'T CLOSE, COMMERCIALIZE!

        Hoping to forestall the closure of McClellan Air Force Base,
in Sacramento, Calif., local officials last week launched a
coalition they hope will spawn a booming high-tech presence in
the region. The coalition, called the Sacramento Regional
Economic Development Alliance (REDA), is designed to foster
commercial use of some of the high-tech capabilities at McClellan
Air Force Base. Local leaders hope the Pentagon will eventually
view McClellan as too valuable to the military and business
sector to be shuttered. But Kenneth Flamm, assistant to the under
secretary of defense and a specialist in dual-use issues, warned
McClellan advocates not to count on the base being spared.

AN ODD TRADING COUPLE.

        Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, during a trade visit here
last week, urged the U.S. not to let political and social
differences between China and the U.S. stand in the way of a
fruitful economic and technological cooperation. He warned that to
discontinue China's Most Favored Nation trade status could
jeopardize that cooperation. Zou said that over the 15 years since
China and the United States established diplomatic relations,
despite ups and downs, difficulties and disputes, the overall
relations between the two countries have moved forward with
exchanges and cooperation in various fields such as information
technology.

TO BE, OR NOT TO BE ... A SUBSIDY.

        An editorial in last Wednesday's Financial Times sharply
criticized the Clinton administration's increased involvement in
U.S. industrial policy. "Old fashioned industrial intervention is
being glossed up and justified under the heading of technology
policy," the editorial said. "But the familiar shape of the pork
barrel is already discernible." The editorial asserts that the
administration is abusing the leverage it gained preserving R&D
subsidies during the recent Uruguay round of trade talks. While the
Times questions the integrity using federal money to subsidize
domestic manufacturing, as is the case with the Pentagon's recent
Flat Panel Display initiative (TTW, May 3, p.1), it also suggests
such endeavors have a history of failure.

WATKINS-JOHNSON'S TWO-PRONGED CONVERSION STRATEGY PAYING OFF

        Despite hard times in the early 1990s, Palo Alto, Calif-
based Watkins-Johnson Co., is finding success with its two
pronged strategy to drive its business away from strict
dependence on the defense market.
        The company is taking advantage of federal defense
conversion initiatives to supplement its own R&D investments in
commercial and dual-use projects, while expanding its
international operations by opening up new, larger facilities in
Asia.
     As an example of the first part of its strategy, W-J is in
the process of negotiating the specifics on a Technology
Reinvestment Project (TRP) award valued at $11 million to develop
a Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) digital base station
for the Personal Communication Services (PCS) wireless market.
     The system will incorporate such advanced technologies as
SMART antenna systems, high-performance digitizers and power
amplifiers.
     The company teamed with ArrayComm, Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.), and Spectrian (Mountainview, Calif.) to put up $5.5
million matched by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
The team will employ dual-use technology in the hopes of
establishing themselves in the PCS market.
        To further offset declining demand in the U.S. defense
sector, W-J has been actively expanding its overseas presence,
particularly in Korea and Japan.  According to W-J documents, the
company expanded office space and staff in Korea, and has plans
to do the same in its Japanese subsidiary during the first half
of 1994.
        This internationalization is designed to get the company
closer to the Pacific Rim's growing base of customers, says
manager of production and information, Frank E. Emery.
        Indeed, the company will market one third of its
semiconductor equipment production to foreign customers this
year. This move, industry analysts say, will contribute
significantly to the estimated 50 percent growth that this facet
of the business is expected to achieve in 1994.
        Elliot H. Rogers, analyst for New York-based Cowen & Company
says this strategy is moving the company in the right direction.
In 1991 and 1992 W-J experienced revenue contractions due to
shrinking sales in the defense industry, but has--with $286
million posted in 1993--begun to experience a sales rebound.
        However, according to Emery, success in defense conversion
has not come easily. Changes in production focus and the
company's infrastructure led to high restructuring charges and a
20 percent work force reduction in 1991. Even so, the company has
still not reached its 1990 sales high of $311 million.
        Moreover, Rogers says that if W-J is to build on its current
success, it will have to be aware of a growing base of
competitors chasing the same semiconductor equipment dollars.
        According to Rogers, W-J's main competitor is Novellus
Systems of San Jose, Calif. Novellus has increased its net sales
from 1992 to 1993 by 63 percent. Current annual sales are pegged
at $113.5 million. In the 1980s only 15 percent of W-J's sales
were commercial, while 85 percent were in defense. Today 40
percent of sales come from non-defense business.

NAVY DUAL USE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON FIVE TECHNOLOGY AREAS

        The Department of the Navy is putting the finishing touches
on defense conversion funding of its own for FY 95. An official
announcement should be made within the next several weeks,
according to Navy spokesman Marc Whetstone.
        Similar to the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), the
program will focus on developing and deploying dual use
technologies. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to solicit
topics in ocean platforms, ocean environment, aircraft platforms,
information systems and control, and human systems.
        Unlike the TRP, however, this program will not necessarily
require that industry partners invest 50 percent or more to a
project, according to Rear Adm. Marc Pelaez, chief of Naval
Research.
        As reported earlier (TTW, April 19, p.6), this Navy defense
technology program will be funded with about $50 million from the
Navy's science and technology budget.
        The ONR is currently in the process of creating a program
brochure which will be sent to any companies requesting
information. Whetstone says the brochure will give a detailed
description of the technology areas the Navy is interested in,
information for submitting proposals, and the necessary forms.
        For more information contact Whetstone at ONR, 703/696-5032.

GOVERNMENT ASKS INDUSTRY TO TAKE LEAD ON FSU CONVERSION, TECH
TRANSFER

        Companies such as Amoco, EG&G, MC Power, Babcock and Wilcox,
Jaycor and Merrill Lynch attended a workshop held late last month
to explore cooperative research projects with Russian and
Ukrainian research institutions, according to Mike Deegan, vice
president of Teledyne, Inc. and interim president of the U.S.
Industry Coalition (USIC).
        USIC, currently funded by the U.S. government through the
Department of Energy (DoE) at $35 million, encourages cooperative
ventures with Russian labs to engage nuclear scientists and
engineers in non-weapons-related work. But it also aims to
provide Russian institutions with U.S. firms' knowledge of
project management, market research and other aspects of business
development and management.
        By gathering together experts from DoE laboratories,
industry, and universities with some background in Ukrainian
affairs, the group hopes to provide a network of contacts to
match potential U.S. contracts with FSU partners. While the U.S.
partners will fund their own R&D and provide business training to
the labs, USIC's $35 million will fund the FSU research effort.
        But "this is not just a give-away program," Deegan said.
"[U.S. partners] will get a marketable product that can be sold
in Russia, the U.S. or both."
        Another incentive for U.S. firms to do business with FSU
labs is that costs for research are far lower than those in the
U.S. The projects will probably cost under $1 million each,
Deegan said.
        "The objective is to spread the wealth, and we can better do
that by funding 40 projects rather than 12," he said.
        The program is good for both U.S. industry as well as
Ukraine, Nadia McConnell, president of the non-profit U.S.-
Ukraine Foundation points out.
        In addition to providing a "springboard" to transfer
military work done in Ukrainian labs to industrial base
development, "it allows U.S. industry to plug into DoE labs," she
said, adding that the project will also boost the presence of
U.S. firms in Ukraine and Russia.

 ...Program Looking for Quick Turn Around

        "We want to get technologies that can be produced and
commercialized in 16-18 months," Deegan said, adding, "We are
targeted to a range of firms," not just small or large, with a
range of technology development interests.
        If a U.S. firm is interested in developing a new product in
conjunction with a Ukrainian institute, USIC says it can provide
the firm with the appropriate contacts in Ukrainian labs. Once
the cooperative project had been negotiated, they would sign a
Project Letter Agreement.
        "The only financial risk is the R&D, which the U.S. firm
undertakes itself," Deegan said. The Russian partner is paid
through cash transfers from government accounts set up by USIC.
There is no funding limit on individual projects.
        There are already around 300 collaborations between Russian,
Ukrainian and DoE institutions that have been established over
the past three years under various programs, but this is the
first government-industry partnership that is a for-profit
enterprise, Deegan said.
        Electronics, communications, and biomedics offer good
potential for developing new products, Deegan said.
        Despite the poor reputation of the health care system of the
Soviet Union, there are some medical areas in which the Russians
are actually ahead of the West, he added.
        Some of the more high-tech physics and engineering projects
include a venture to create a model to determine material
strength, fracture and failure levels and an initiative to
develop system and application software for parallel computing.

NIST TO FOCUS $745M TOWARD LONG-RANGE ADVANCED TECH PROGRAMS

        Industry welcomed NIST's announcement last week that it
would focus its next round of the Advanced Technology Program on
five specific technology areas. But some are complaining that
since the funding is spread out over five years, the money
doesn't seem like all that much.
        The agency will spent $745 million over the next five years,
matched by an equal amount from industry, to develop advanced
technologies in critical areas such as DNA analysis and computer
integrated manufacturing.
        "I think it's a good idea that NIST is focusing on specific
areas," says Walt Finkelstein, president of Advanced Lithography
Group, of Columbia, Md. "This method allows companies in those
areas to have a better competitive edge in winning funding."
        However, he says that $745 million over five years does not
seem like a lot of money considering that the budget for the 1994
Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP) is nearly $650 million for
just one year.
        The program will focus on five specific areas which were
selected based on industry suggestions, and evaluated against
four criteria: potential benefit to the U.S., strength of
technical ideas, evidence of strong industry commitment, and the
opportunity for ATP funds to make a difference in moving
technology forward. The five areas are:

        *  Tools for DNA Diagnostics - A five-year, $145 million
        program to develop compact, low cost, automated DNA analysis
        technologies and equipment.
        *  Information Infrastructure for Health Care - A five-year,
        $185 million program to develop an information
        infrastructure to enable integrated medical information
        systems.
        *  Manufacturing Composite Structures - A five year, $160
        million program to reduce the high initial cost of using
        advanced composite materials for commercial applications
        such as bridges and automobiles.
        *  Component-Based Software - A five-year, $150 million
        program to develop technologies necessary to enable
        systematically re-useable software components.
        *  Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics - A
        five-year, $105 million program to develop a flexible
        software-based framework to boost manufacturing
        productivity.

        Interested companies may apply for up to $2 million over
three years. Joint ventures of two or more companies can apply
for five years worth of funding with no dollar limit. NIST will
sponsor a series of public meetings on the program. The first
will be held June 2-3, at the Holiday Inn, Gaithersburg, Md. For
more information call 1-800 ATP-FUND.
        Because full proposals can get expensive, NIST suggests that
companies first submit abbreviated proposals for funding in the
form of a white paper to allow NIST to determine if the project
has the potential to meet the needs of the program.

GERMANY:  INTERVENES WITH BANGLADESH ON CASE OF TASLIMA NASREEN

   NEW DELHI, July 31 (IPS) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
winding up a visit to India this week revealed that his country had
intervened with the Bangladesh government on behalf of fugitive
writer Taslima Nasreen.
   "Germany undertook a demarche to the Bangladesh government that
we want to look after her case so that she can move freely in her
country," Kinkel, who is also Vice Chancellor told a news
conference here in Delhi.
   But he declined to elaborate on the statement, saying, "It is
in the interest of Taslima Nasreen that we do not disclose all that
we have decided on her behalf. I hope you understand."
   Germany, which is the current president of the European Union,
last week said European foreign ministers had agreed at a meeting
in Brussels to instruct their ambassadors in Dhaka to urge the
Bangladesh government to protect the feminist writer.
   "It was at my initiative that European Union ministers discussed
her case at length and said she was welcome to all the 16 member
countries," Kinkel said here.
   Nasreen is in hiding in Bangladesh where the authorities have
issued an arrest warrant against her under pressure from Muslim
fundamentalists who want her hanged for blasphemy.
   The Bangladesh government has said that Nasreen is free to go
abroad, but must first submit herself to due process of law. The
writer, who denies the charge, is accused of recommending a
revision of the Koran in an interview to a Calcutta newspaper,
where she had stopped over on her way back from a business trip to
Europe concerning publication of her work in translation.
   What she actually told the paper, she explained, was that what
needed revision was the Sharia, the Islamic code of law, because
of its repressive legislation on women, not the Koran itself, which
is the Holy Writ of Mohammedanism.
   Kinkel, who arrived in India on July 27 on a bilateral trade and
business promotion visit, also discussed Kashmir, the reform of the
United Nations system and nuclear non-proliferation with his hosts.
   Germany supports India's case for a permanent seat on the U.N.
Security Council as much as it seeks one for itself, he said,
adding that both countries have agreed to cooperate to work for
reforming the U.N. system.
   "The U.N. Security Council does not reflect the situation in
the world as it is today," Kinkel said. As the biggest European
country and leading world economic power, Germany had "obligations
towards the international community", he added.
   On India's dispute over Kashmir with arch-adversary Pakistan,
Germany has advised both New Delhi and Islamabad to find a solution
on the basis of U.N. resolutions and the two-decade-old bilateral
Shimla accord, he said.
   The northern Indian state has been a bone of contention since
Pakistan's creation in 1947. Islamabad accuses Indian security
forces of rights abuse in battling the four-year-old Kashmir
insurgency, which New Delhi says is being aided by Pakistan.
   Rivalry in the subcontinent has stoked fears of a nuclear
confrontation. Though there is no clinching evidence, both India
and Pakistan are believed to possess the necessary expertise to
build nuclear bombs.
   Neither country has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
(NPT). India says it discriminates between the nuclear haves and
have-nots.
   Foreign Minister Kinkel said India and Germany have agreed to
discuss nuclear non-proliferation, an issue "on which India has
its own point of view".
   Bonn had raised the NPT during Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao's second official trip to Germany earlier this year.
Chancellor Kohl who visited New Delhi a year ago had urged India
to sign the NPT, but did not link this to future aid.
   Germany is India's second largest donor after Japan and has
given more than 15 billion dm since 1958, making India the largest
recipient of official development assistance (ODA).
   On July 28 Kinkel signed a financial cooperation agreement with
Finance Minister Manmoham Singh that offers 460 million D-marks for
mainly poverty alleviation and the protection of natural resources
and the environment.
   India is a major partner in Germany's current efforts to expand
economic contacts in Asia, the foreign minister said. His
delegation included 24 German business leaders.
   "The intensification of economic relations is at the center of
my visit and talks in New Delhi. We look at India as a future
mega-market and are looking for a real partnership in our economic
relations," Kinkel declared.

BANGLADESH:  ANTI-TASLIMA RALLIES IN DHAKA

   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Armed police were posted outside mosques
and in sensitive localities here in the Bangladesh capital July 29
to maintain peace during two rallies after evening prayers to press
for the hanging of feminist writer Taslima Nasreen.
   Hundreds of people streamed into Dhaka from adjoining townships
and villages for the twin rallies called separately by the
opposition Jamaat-e-Dulami and the United Action Alliance of 13
other groups.
   Nasreen has been in hiding since June 4, trying to escape a
government arrest warrant and a Muslim fatwa for blasphemy.
   The Khaleda Zia government is under growing pressure from the
West to protect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is being
described as the female Salman Rushdie.
   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel who is visiting New Delhi
is reported saying again on July 29 on behalf of the European
Union, of which Germany is the current chairman, that Dhaka has
been told it must ensure her safety or allow her to leave the
country.
   The Bangladesh government continues to insist that the country's
laws provide ample protection for the fugitive writer, but she must
first submit herself to the due process of the law.
   The government has said that Nasreen would be allowed to leave
the country after she proves her innocence in court.
   The twin rallies follow a month of protests and meetings by
religious extremists to mobilize support countrywide for their
campaign to make Bangladesh an Islamic Republic, hang Nasreen for
blasphemy and ban non-governmental groups that they are accusing
of anti-Islamic activities.
   Dhaka was relatively quiet on July 29 as Friday is the Islamic
holiday, and all offices and some markets in the city were closed.
   Rival calls for nationwide strikes on June 30, had led to ugly
clashes between Nasreen's supporters and opponents, causing the
death of a 14-year-old in a northern village.
   Nasreen is being hounded for calling for a revision of the Koran
in an interview granted to an Indian newspaper, The Statesman. The
writer has denied the charges, saying she was misquoted.
   The government wants her arrested for "maliciously outraging
the religious feelings of Muslims", a charge the religious
extremists insist must be punished with death.

PHILIPPINES:  CATHOLIC CHURCH LAUNCHES CRUSADE AGAINST CAIRO
              U.N. CONFERENCE ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT

By Lian Nemenzo-Hernandez
   MANILA, July 31 (IPS) -- The Catholic Church in the Philippines
has gone on the offensive against the government's population
policy in the run-up to the big U.N. conference in Cairo next
month, but women's groups here are determined to fight back.
   Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin this week called on the
people of Asia's only Catholic nation to join a protest rally next
month to protest the government's plans to reduce population growth
rate with artificial contraceptives and legalized abortion.
   "We want to make known to the president and his cabinet our
indignation and outrage at the abuses being allowed by government
against the family and our children," Sin said.
   He said children are being bombarded with reading materials and
films containing "pornographic, perverse and poisonous sexual
propaganda" as part of their education, and are being conditioned
to adopt a "contraceptive mentality".
   "The government's population program brainwashes children to
accept as normal, attractive and even glamorous certain unnatural,
abnormal and perverse sexual relationships and behavior such as
homosexuality, lesbianism, incest, sodomy, oral sex, contraception,
sterilization and abortion," Sin added.
   Education and health officials dismissed the Cardinal's
outburst, saying he was engaging in a "baseless debate".
   It was the Church's strongest criticism yet of Manila's
population policy, and appears to be carefully coordinated with the
Vatican's broadsides against some provisions in the Cairo
documents. Last month, the Vatican reportedly sent a faxed protest
to the Philippine government criticizing its support for abortion.
   Sin attacked the Philippine stance at the International
Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in
September: "Global forces, backed by the wealth of powerful
nations, are out to destroy the family by first destroying our
children."
   The government of Fidel Ramos, the country's first Protestant
president, is promoting both natural and artificial methods of
birth control to help bring down an annual 2.5 percent birth rate.
   Anti-abortion groups say the Philippine delegation to Cairo, led
by Health Secretary Juan Flavier, is planning to support a U.S.-
backed proposal for acceptance of abortion as a birth control
method.
   But health officials say none of the government's programs
advocate abortion.
   "We have to be clear on this," said Health Under-Secretary Jaime
Galvez Tan. "We provide and teach natural and artificial methods.
But we leave the decision up to the woman herself, her reproductive
rights and her choices."
   Member of the Philippine delegate to Cairo, Marilen Danguilan
agrees: "The accusation is unfounded. We rejected abortion as a
means of contraception. In fact, we have been arguing with the U.S.
delegation not to be so fixated on abortion. The issue is bigger."
   Manila Vice Mayor Joselito Atienza, who heads the organisation
Pro-Life Philippines, said the government should "reject the draft
(ICPD) resolution and the way of life being imposed on us by
foreign nations". He said the 83-page document contains provisions
that are "contrary to Filipino culture, tradition and religion".
   Women activists say such statements reflect the "very narrow"
thinking that has placed women in a subordinate position in
society.
   "The Church's thinking with regard to women's role continues to
relegate them to the Middle Ages and denies women the right to make
decisions for themselves," says Ana Maria Nemenzo, national
coordinator of WomanHealth Philippines, a non-governmental group.
   "The Catholic Church sees 'abortion' as lurking behind every
phrase and provision in the draft ICPD document," she says.
   The Church is suspicious of terms like "safe motherhood",
fearing it could be used to smuggle in the concept of abortion. It
even opposes the World Health Organisation's (WHO) definition of
"reproductive health".
   "But the question of population and development goes far beyond
the issue of abortion," says Nemenzo. "For us women, it touches on
gender equity and women's self-determination, and the appropriate
development strategy that will guarantee these."
   Several non-governmental groups sponsored a forum here today to
discuss the draft ICPD document and its implications on the status
of women in the Philippines and the rest of the world.
   Organisers said despite lip service given to improving status
of women in the Third World, nothing will come out of these efforts
unless women's self-determination is recognized and accepted.
   Antonio de los Reyes, president of the Council of the Laity of
the Philippines, criticized the country's delegation to the Cairo
meeting, which he said includes "academic disciples of
unconditional artificial birth control and at least three open
advocates of the cause for legalization of abortion".
   "Not one Pro-Life proponent was included in the delegation," he
complained.
   Women's groups say the Vatican should not be allowed to
intervene in U.N. proceedings. The Church only has observer status
at the United Nations and should therefore not be given undue
importance and space in official U.N. sessions, they add.
   Because of persistent lobbying by the Vatican, several
provisions in the ICPD document have been "bracketed" or identified
as areas that still have to be debated in Cairo, including
reproductive rights, reproductive health, fertility regulation and
safe motherhood.
   Women activists say they will continue to push for gender equity
in all these issues in Cairo and will lobby to ensure that various
contraceptive options remain open to women.

ALGERIA:  FRENCH GROUPS SUPPORT INTELLECTUALS, THEATRE DIRECTORS
          DOCTORS AND PROFESSORS DRIVEN OUT BY ISLAMIC FANATICISM

By Barbara Borst
   PARIS, July 31 (IPS) -- With political violence in Algeria
claiming new victims daily, French organizations offer solidarity
any way they can -- aid to refugees, information campaigns, running
pressure groups and supporting democrats-in-exile.
   They don't expect help from the French government, which rejects
Algerian requests for asylum, say the groups, for fear that doing
so will trigger massive immigration to France. France, they add,
still takes a colonialist view of a country it held for 132 years.
   Hugo Colonna of the International Support Committee for Algerian
Intellectuals said his group's goals are to disseminate accurate
information about the complex political conflict and "to permit
those intellectuals to express themselves in France."
   Theatre directors, journalists, doctors and university
professors have been among targets of attacks that have taken at
least 4,000 lives in Algeria since January 1992.
   Violence erupted after the military took power in January 1992
and cancelled the second round of elections the radical Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) were poised to win. The military banned the
FIS and launched a campaign to repress fundamentalist opposition.
It claims that the Islamic militants have committed most killings.
   The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for
many attacks, including those on foreigners, but FIS says that the
security forces have slaughtered thousands of people themselves in
their bid to suppress Islamic radicalism.
   "It's not just a question of combat between Islamists and the
state," Colonna said. "In the middle there is a society. It was
one of the leading countries (in the region), rich with potential.
   "There was democracy from 1988 until 1992. They're still
struggling for that." However, there are deep antagonisms between
and within opposition movements, he noted.
   Sami Boumendjel of the Committee for Dialogue in Algeria said
that to resolve the conflict the regime must return to the
democratic process it interrupted. "No one can impose himself by
force. We must go back to the sovereignty of the people," he said.
   Boumendjel's committee seeks dialogue with all factions that
favor democracy through commitment to elections, whatever the
results, the establishment of a constitution and the rule of law,
and equal access for all men and women to work, schools and other
social benefits.
   Some charge that fundamentalists would not practice such
principles, and Bernard Dreano of the Forum of Mediterranean
Citizens, among others, warn of fundamentalists (including former
Communists) with a Stalinist devotion to centralized power.
   But Boumendjel is convinced that there are Islamic moderates who
can be an essential part of the solution. "Our strategy is to
enclose Islamists in the framework of democracy," he said.
   Dreano says the group tries to create "space for reflection and
solidarity" that sets the conflict in context. Algeria is not alone
among North African states in facing serious challenges from
Islamic fundamentalists, although its methods of combatting them
differ from those used in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt.
   "France has no policy except to reinforce the power in place in
Algeria," Dreano said. "They don't support the opposition."
   Mouloud Aounit of the Movement Against Racism (MRAP) said most
Algerian refugees, now arriving in France by the hundreds, don't
seek political asylum. "They don't want to cut ties with Algeria.
They just want to breathe a little," he said.
   Those who do seek asylum generally run afoul of the French
government's interpretation of the Geneva Convention to cover only
those persecuted by the state.
   Ordinary people caught between the government and Islamic
militants generally don't qualify, he said. France focuses on
Algeria when a foreigner is killed but pays little attention to the
murder of thousands of ordinary Algerians.
   Souad Benani of Nanas Beurs, a French group for women of North
African ancestry, said her organisation tries to inform the French
people and aid Algerians who enter France.
   "Women often demand refugee status on the basis of sexism," she
said. "They are threatened by fundamentalism. But political refugee
status is already very difficult to acquire. We fight case by
case."
   Robert Menard, president of Reporters Without Borders (RSF),
said his group pressures Algerian authorities, operates a toll-free
telephone number for information on obtaining refugee status in
France and helps immigrants find work.
   But while RSF collected substantial funds to support journalists
in the former Yugoslavia, it had less luck raising funds for
Algerian journalists, who need such things as walkie-talkies to
improve their survival chances.
   Perhaps that is because "90 percent of the press is propaganda"
in Algeria, Menard claimed. Still, he conceded, with 15 journalists
killed in two and a half years, "there's no other country where
it's more dangerous."

ALGERIA:  ARMED ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OFFERS TO END ASSASSINATION
          OF FOREIGNERS IF LEADER RELEASED FROM PRISON

By Cherif Cordahi
   CAIRO, July 31 (IRS) -- The killing of foreigners in Algeria is
likely to continue despite an offer by Islamic radicals blamed for
several murders to end their campaign if the authorities release
a senior militant member from prison.
   Local journalists and Western diplomats in the North African
state say the government is unlikely to cave in to the militant
demand that it release Abdelhak Layada, a senior figure in the
militant Armed Islamic Movement (MIA).
   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), a sister-
organisation of the MIA, demanded Layada's release after they freed
two Arab ambassadors they kidnapped a week earlier.
   Western diplomats in the capital, Algiers, told IPS this week
that the GIA had changed its mind about trading the two
ambassadors, Kassem Asker Djebrani of Yemen and Hill Bin Salem
Assiyabi of Oman, for Layada.
   "There was a lot debate within the GIA about what to do if the
government refused to cave in to their demands," said one diplomat.
"In the end they decided to release the two because they were Arabs
and good Muslims."
   Once released, the two ambassadors handed a message from the GIA
to government officials making the offer of ending their killing
of foreigners in return for Layada.
   Government officials refused to comment about the militant
demand. But in a statement the authorities said that "Algeria
reasserts its determination to follow up its efforts to protect its
hosts and visitors in accordance with the noble principles of
Islam."
   Around 4,000 people -- mainly security personnel and militants
-- have been killed in almost three years of violence since the
government canceled elections in January 1992 which the Islamic
radicals were poised to win. The MIA is linked to the now-outlawed
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which won most of the votes.
   At least 42 foreigners have been killed since the GIA warned all
foreigners to leave Algeria by December last year.
   After a lull in the spring months, the number of killings has
rocketed in recent weeks. On July 6, seven Italians died when
militants climbed aboard their boat at night and slit their throats
as they slept.
   On July 11, seven more foreigners -- four Russians, two
Yugoslavs and one Romanian -- were also killed. On July 20, a local
journalist with the national news agency, the Algerian Press
Service (APS), was gunned down in front of his home.
   One journalist with APS, who did not want to be named, told IPS
she was very scared. "We're all keeping a low profile," she said
by telephone. "We don't know who's going to be killed next."
   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA member
is a "serious development" for the military-backed government. "It
shows that the different groups are clubbing together," said one.
   "They've conducted joint operations before but this is the first
time I remember one group specifically asking for the release of
a member another group." Layada, who has been in prison for almost
year, was arrested in Morocco in January 1993 under an extradition
agreement with Algeria.
   Algeria's neighbours -- Morocco and Tunisia in particular --
fear the country's militant insurgency will spill over their
borders, so are helping in any way they can by cooperating closely
with the Algerian authorities.
   The country has been in political turmoil since January 1992
when the army intervened to prevent a victory by the FIS in the
country's first multi-party elections.
   Violence exploded across the country despite the proclamation
of a state of emergency and the imposition of a curfew in the 10
central districts of the country.
   The unrest is fueled by the spiralling economic crisis. Caught
between the fall in world oil prices, a slowdown in outside
investments and the troubles of industry, almost 1.4 million out
of Algeria's 5.3 million labour force are out of a job.
   The unemployment rate has risen by 32 percent in the past three
years. According to official statistics some 84.5 percent of the
registered jobless are aged between 16 and 29, and 68 percent of
these have never worked. A majority have no skills.
   The problem was met by a 40 percent devaluation of the dinar
accompanied by an increase in interest rates to discourage
inflation in April.
   In return, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) promised
Algeria a stand-by credit of one billion dollars, opening the way
for a re-scheduling of its $26 billion foreign debt and for new
credits from other donors.

ALGERIA:  ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT DETERMINED NOT TO MERGE
          WITH OTHER MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST ORGANIZATIONS

   CAIRO, July 31 (IPS) -- Indications that the Islamic radical
movement in Algeria is in turmoil were reinforced this week by
statements by one faction resisting alliance with other groups, and
reports that some armed groups are operating in support of each
other.
   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) demanded the
freedom of a leader of another radical group after they released
two Arab ambassadors they had kidnapped a week earlier.
   The GIA is blamed for a series of murders of foreigners but had
promised to end the campaign if the authorities released Abdelhak
Layada, a senior figure in the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA).
   Western diplomats in the capital, Algiers, told IPS this week
that the GIA had changed its mind about trading the two
ambassadors, Kassem Asker Djebrani of Yemen and Hill Bin Salem
Assiyabi of Oman, for Layada.
   Around 4,000 people -- mainly security personnel and militants
-- have been killed in almost three years of violence since the
government canceled elections in January 1992 which the Islamic
radicals were poised to win.
   The MIA is linked to the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) which won most of the votes. But the FIS is divided into
several factions, some of which are ready to talk with the
authorities, some of which want to fight on.
   Early in the week a leader of one of these factions denied
reports that the FIS -- the largest of the armed groups -- was to
merge with the other two Islamic groups.
   "The broad-based FIS will continue to exist as the Islamic
Salvation Front and will not dissolve itself into another
organisation for illegitimate reasons," said a faxed communique'
received in Paris from FIS spokesman-in-exile Rabah Kebir.
   Earlier this month a similar statement signed by FIS leader
Anouar Nasr Eddine Haddam said the FIS's armed wing was to merge
with the GIA and MIA -- under the GIA's name.
   Kebir's message called on FIS "fighters in the field" to "devote
themselves to fighting and to leave larger issues to their
commanders."
   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA member
is a "serious development" for the government. "It shows that the
different groups are clubbing together," said one.
   "They've conducted joint operations before but this is the first
time I remember one group specifically asking for the release of
a member of another group." Layada, who has been in prison for
almost year, was arrested in Morocco in January 1993 under an
extradition agreement with Algeria.
   "There was a lot of debate within the GIA about what to do if
the government refused to cave in to their demands," said one
diplomat. "In the end they decided to release the two because they
were Arabs and good Muslims."
   Once released, the two ambassadors handed a message from the GIA
to government officials making the offer of ending their killing
of foreigners in return for Layada.
   Government officials refused to comment on the militant demand.
But in a statement, they said that "Algeria reasserts its
determination to follow up its efforts to protect its hosts and
visitors in accordance with the noble principles of Islam."
   After a lull in the spring months, the number of killings has
rocketed. At least 42 foreigners have been killed since the GIA
warned all foreigners to leave Algeria by December last year.
   On July 11, seven foreigners -- four Russians, two Yugoslavs and
one Rumanian were killed. On July 20, a local journalist with the
national news agency, the Algerian Press Service (APS), was gunned
down in front of his home.
   A journalist with APS, who did not want to be named, told IPS
she was scared. "We're all keeping a low profile," she said by
phone on July 25. "We don't know who's going to be killed next."
   Algeria has been in political turmoil since January 1992 when
the army intervened to prevent a victory by the FIS in the
country's first multi-party elections. Violence exploded across the
country despite the proclamation of a state of emergency.
   The unrest is fueled by the spiralling economic crisis. Caught
between the fall in world oil prices, a slowdown in outside
investments and the troubles of industry, almost 1.4 million out
of Algeria's 5.3 million labour force are out of a job.
   The unemployment rate has risen by 32 percent in the past three
years. According to official statistics some 84.5 percent of the
registered jobless are aged between 16 and 29, and 68 percent of
these have never worked. A majority have no skills.
   The problem was met by a 40 percent devaluation of the dinar

PAKISTAN:  SECTARIAN CLASHES BETWEEN SHI'ITE AND SUNNI MUSLIMS
           CONTINUE TO ROCK KARACHI

By Imran Munir
   ISLAMABAD, July 31 (IPS) -- Pakistan's largest city of Karachi
continued to be disturbed this week by gun battles between
sectarian groups that the government is blaming on Indian agents.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has accused India of fanning
trouble in her home province of Sindh, of which Karachi is the
capital, has called a special meeting of her cabinet in the city
to discuss ways to end the violence.
   Activists of the Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jaffaria were again exchanging
fire with supporters of the fanatical Sunni Sipan-i- Sahaba in
various parts of Karachi, agencies report.
   Karachi has been almost shut down by the gun fights, violence
and killings that broke out July 22, and has so far claimed the
lives of nine people.
   The violence was sparked off by a grenade attack on a coach of
Sunni Muslims returning from a religious ceremony. Now it has
snowballed into a familiar pattern of revenge attacks.
   Six Shi'ite worshipers were injured by unidentified gunmen as
they were leaving a mosque after morning prayers on July 24.
   On the same day in another part of the city a police constable
was gunned down by masked youths, and the body of an unidentified
man who had been shot through the head was found.
   The city was only just recovering from a round of sectarian
clashes between April 29 and May 5. Factional strife within the
powerful Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM) of Muslim refugees from India
is claimed to be behind the violence.
   Premier Bhutto claims the MQM has been infiltrated by Indian
intelligence agents who are plotting to destabilize her government
and the country.
   Pakistani intelligence reports allege they have evidence. Secret
reports of the Interior Ministry corroborate the charges.
   The Bhutto government has called a cabinet meeting in Karachi
to discuss ways to renew contacts with the MQM in order to resolve
the ongoing crisis.
   The government seems to have realized the failure of previous
measures and now feels it must include all groups including the MQM
in discussions to end the sectarian feuding in Karachi.

BRITAIN:  HINDUS FIGHT TO KEEP THEIR TEMPLE FESTIVAL DAYS

By Susan Litherland
   LONDON, July 31 (IPS) -- If ever an arranged marriage faced
problems it is the one innocently orchestrated by a former rock
star between a popular British Hindu sect and residents of a
classic leafy English village.
   Letchmore Heath in Hertfordshire, home to wealthy London
commuters, nestles in picturesque fashion around a pub on the
green, a duck pond and blacksmith. In its midst stands a holy Hindu
shrine visited some six days a year by thousands of worshippers.
   The problem, according to the local Hertsmere Council's managing
director Philip Copland, is that the Hindus only have permission
to use it as a theological college. They are contravening the law,
which is made worse by the large number of devotees who visit the
temple.
   Akhandadhi Das, president of the temple, argues, "Without a
shrine there could be no question of training priests. We teach all
aspects of the worship of Krishna which the general Hindu community
finds fulfilling. Naturally they want to come and worship."
   Twenty-one years ago Bhaktivedanta Manor, a 19th century mock
Tudor mansion set in 17 acres of grounds, was donated to the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness by George Harrison,
a member of The Beatles pop group.
   The tussle between Krishnas and locals heated up in the mid-80s
when Hertsmere Council sought to limit the numbers of people
attending festival days.
   Before long, the numbers crept back up to about 20,000, the
council went to the High Court, and were told the best way to
control the situation was to issue an enforcement notice that would
prevent the manor from operating as a temple.
   The Krishnas appealed and were turned down. They went to the
European Commission in March for help but were told rights of
worship didn't necessarily overrule the planning laws of Britain.
The council was deemed just and once more issued an enforcement
order.
   Copland says: "These days we still get more than 12,000 people
gathering at the temple on festival days.
   "Some council members believe that despite the proposed access
road, this is not acceptable in a village like Letchmore Heath."
   To strengthen their case the Krishnas have proposed building an
access road, at their own expense, that would take traffic away
from the village center.
   They have already paid a deposit of 100,000 pounds ($150,000)
for the option to purchase the land, and say the total cost would
be in the region of one million pounds ($1.5 million).
   A decision on the proposal was expected last week but the
council failed to reach agreement and deferred it until October.
   Naresh Chadha, chairman of the Temple Defence Movement, was
unsurprised at the dithering. He claims the Conservatives in the
jointly-run council came with a pile of amendments determined not
to allow the scheme to go ahead. "They arrived full of pre-
conceptions," he points out.
   Some members of the Hindu community claim it has less to do with
traffic than with racial prejudice. Sorita Bhatia, a journalist on
the London-based Asian newspaper Eastern Eye, is convinced
religious discrimination is at play.
   "The offices of the racist, right-wing British National Party
are allowed to stay open despite national pressure, but our temple
may have to close due to trouble stirred up by a few local
villagers," she says.
   There are rows going on throughout the country over the siting
of mosques, but because Hindus are less vocal their temples don't
get public support, she adds.
   Chadha claims it has more to do with snobbery. "The main issue
is that property values may be affected by a lot of Hindus visiting
the village."
   If the application is finally turned down the Krishnas will take
their fight to the Department of the Environment. Their
determination not to be moved to a possibly less sensitive site is
rooted in the manor's history.
   Harrison gave the house to Srila Prabhupada, founder of the
sect, who lived there periodically between 1973 and his death in
1977.
   "Once a Hindu temple has been established, it can never be
moved. We will defend it vigorously," warned Chadha. "We will form
a housing trust and buy up every house that goes up for sale in the
village."
   It is not an idle threat. The sect is backed by the immensely
wealthy Hinduja family who live in Britain. Indeed, the matter has
been taken as high as the Indian parliament.
   Chadha has held meetings with L.K. Advani, leader of the
opposition Hindu Bharatiya Janata party who has promised he will
do anything he can to help.
   The Congress government has been sufficiently rattled to send
a senior minister, Kamal Nath, to Britain to warn ministers that
British contracts could be at risk over the row.
   It was reported in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that Prime
Minister John Major was sympathetic to the Krishna's case, but
could not intervene in a local government matter. That, says
Chadha, hasn't changed.
   A possible flashpoint could be the celebrations for Krishna's
birthday at the end of August. A two-day affair, Copland says it
will involve "lots of noisy chanting and fireworks". He believes
the council will enforce against it.
   "We have suggested to the Krishnas that they might consider
holding it in a nearby country park. Devotees could come to the
manor, worship before the statues, and then be bussed to the park.
Their response seems to be favorable."
   Whatever the outcome of the October council meeting, the row
seems set to rumble on indeterminately. The Department of the
Environment cannot close the theological college, even if it does
prevent worshippers entering the temple.
   If that happens, the villagers are likely to find devotees
practicing their religion outside the temple gates.

SUDAN:  REBELS REJECT KHARTOUM'S UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE

By Horace Awori
   NAIROBI, July 31 (IPS) -- Southern Sudanese rebels have rejected
a unilateral ceasefire declared by the government that was due to
come into effect at midnight on July 30.
   "The ceasefire is a sham. It has been calculated to deceive the
people of Sudan and the international community", said Steven Wondu
of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
   He said the military government of Lt-Gen. Omar Hassan al Bashir
had launched three major offensives against the SPLA stronghold at
Nimule on the Uganda border in the past few days.
   "As I speak now, heavy fighting is continuing. We have repulsed
three attacks which were preceded by heavy bombardments," Wondu
claimed.
   He said the Sudanese government forces lost 739 troops in the
battle of Nimule when they tried to cross the Awa River to enter
the city.
   Government forces had captured the adjacent towns of Pageri and
Aswa about three months ago, and have been pushing on to dislodge
the rebels from Nimule.
   Wondu, who represents an SPLA faction led by Col. John Garang,
described the ceasefire declaration, announced over state-run Radio
Omdurman as "unprocedural."
   He said, "President Daniel Moi (of Kenya), who is the chairman
of the (peace) talks, had appealed for a ceasefire and any response
should have been formally presented to him and the negotiators for
discussion."
   Wondu said the SPLA had immediately given a formal response to
Moi's appeal and "we are surprised that the chairman of the talks
learnt of the (government's) ceasefire through the press."
   He claimed that the ceasefire only covered gunfire, leaving out
aerial bombardments and troop movements. "This renders it
meaningless and insincere and we shall continue to defend
ourselves."
   Wondu said the SPLA would only reciprocate if Khartoum accepted
an internationally monitored ceasefire within the context of the
six-nation IGADD peace initiative.
   The Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Desertification
(IGADD), which is brokering the ongoing peace talks between the
Sudanese government and the two factions of the SPLA here, groups
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda.
   According to Wondu, the talks, which have been going on behind
closed doors center on demand for self-determination for the south
and a secular arrangement for a proposed interim period that would
precede separate statehood for the region.
   "We in the SPLA unconditionally accept these principles and will
only negotiate on their basis," said Wondu.
   The SPLA has been fighting against domination of the mainly
Christian-African south by the Arab-Islamic north since 1983. More
than a million people have been killed and another three million
displaced in the fighting.
   Earlier mediations by Nigeria and by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter failed to make any headway.
   But the SPLA itself is divided. The rebel movement split into
two groups in 1991.
   Early this week the factions clashed in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
region in southern Sudan and 1,000 people were killed, according
to a Catholic bishop in the area.

ULSTER:  IRA'S POLITICAL WING DEFENDS REJECTION OF PEACE PLAN

By Sarah O'Hara
   DUBLIN, July 31 (IPS) -- Northern Irish republican leader Gerry
Adams this week put a positive face on the weekend rejection of a
Anglo-Irish peace plan by political representatives of guerrillas
fighting British rule in the disputed province.
   Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein -- the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has waged a 25-year war against
British rule in Northern Ireland -- insisted that the peace process
was still alive, despite his party's rejection of the initiative.
   "We have a peace process which can't be stopped," he said in
reviewing the conference in Letterkenny, in the Republic of
Ireland. "It may be too slow but it can't be stopped and that is
a point that is missed, you see. People miss the big picture."
   Sinn Fein, which represents only one in ten voters in Northern
Ireland, has held center stage for most of the last eight months
since the British and Irish prime ministers began a joint peace
initiative with the so-called Downing Street Declaration.
   The Declaration attempts to recognize the rights of both the
majority Northern Irish Protestant community to remain part of the
United Kingdom and the minority Catholic community to its
aspiration for a united Ireland.
   Both Irish and British leaders hoped it would encourage the IRA
to call a permanent ceasefire in return for a place at the
negotiating table alongside Irish, British and Northern Irish
constitutional parties.
   But Sinn Fein again refused to either accept or reject the
Declaration, arguing instead that the British government should
"join the persuaders" in trying to convince the pro-British
Protestant majority that they could live in a united Ireland.
   Meanwhile the IRA has continued its armed struggle with British
forces, and attempted new bombing attacks against targets on the
British mainland.
   Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, was surprisingly upbeat
in his response, saying this week that he could see "some positive
signals" from Sinn Fein.
   He said the peace process would continue, with or without Sinn
Fein and that his government would go on searching for agreement
with Britain on new political structures for Northern Ireland
(Ulster).
   In contrast, his Deputy Dick Spring, also shadow foreign
minister and leader of the Irish Labour Party, described the
Letterkenny conference decision as sickening. "I think we must be
living in totally different worlds if Sinn Fein sees the conference
as a positive development," he said.
   And British government Minister for Northern Ireland Patrick
Mayhew said the initiative for peace did not rest with Sinn Fein
and that Sinn Fein were "rejecting democracy" because they could
not achieve their aims through the ballot box.
   Mayhew said the two governments were preparing a framework
document, to establish new relationships between North and South,
and between the Irish and British governments as well.
   Of Sinn Fein, he said, "We have never waited upon them. We have
not been spending several months waiting, twiddling our thumbs, to
see what Sinn Fein were going to do. We have been pressing on, the
two governments and the constitutional parties, with our political
work. We've got to go on doing that and we will."
   Reynolds, who leads the populist Fianna Fail party in a
coalition government with Labour, is now under pressure from Irish
opposition politicians suspicious of the motivations of the IRA.
   John Bruton, leader of the conservative opposition party, Fine
Gael, said the Declaration had not progressed peace. He believed
it was "ultimately futile" to expect a ceasefire from the IRA,
which he described as "a classic revolutionary organisation".
   "They use violence some of the time, they use artificial offers
of peace at other times and they use these to break the will of
democratic politicians," he said.
   Adams said that the peace process had been "kick-started" by
himself and the leader of the constitutional nationalist SDLP, John
Hume, "nurtured" by the Irish government,  and "helped" by
"nationalist Ireland", with no assistance from the British.
   "What we did yesterday was to give a considered and detailed
response to the Downing Street Declaration. We're the only party
to give such a detailed response to the Declaration," he said.
   "What we have done is to isolate positive elements (in the
Declaration) that can be built up and negative elements which we
can seek to revoke. The governments never said it was a solution,
the governments said it was a step forward.
   Much of the thinking on the part of the Irish government over
the last eight months has been based on the idea that Adams
represents a significant grouping within Sinn Fein and IRA which
would like to see an end to the conflict.
   However many "doves" in the republican movement may not be
prepared to force the issue, for fear it would split the IRA and
produce a newer, more vicious group.

TIBET:  DALAI LAMA TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FESTIVAL

   OSLO, July 31 (IPS) -- Tibetan leader-in-exile and Nobel Prize
winner, the Dalai Lama, will visit the Norwegian city of Trondheim
in October to address the International Student Festival in
Trondheim (ISFiT).
   The main theme of the festival from Oct 6-15 is Human Rights,
said festival organizer Rina Sunder and ISFiT Head of Groups Lars
Bjoergan Schroeder. They travelled to Dharamsala, India, where the
Dalai Lama lives in exile, to secure his support.
   The two students made a personal representation after the
Tibetan leader's representatives in London and Dharamsala initially
declined the invitation on his behalf. While in India the two also
invited a number of Indian government officials and human rights
activists who will also attend the ISFiT events.
   His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, to his followers the "earthly
manifestation of the Avalokiteshvara, Bodhisattva of Compassion"
has spent over 35 years trying to find a non-violent response to
the armed invasion and annexation of his historic homeland.
   Since the Chinese invaded in 1959, Tibet's temples have been
razed, its natural resources plundered and its lands seized for
Chinese settlers and nuclear facilities. The Tibetan environment
has been degraded and a long list of human rights violations have
seen monks and nuns persecuted and people imprisoned without trial.
   "I am fighting for the maintenance of our culture and our
identity," he told IPS in an interview this year. He says one
million Tibetans have died since China invaded in 1949. Since then
Tibet's spiritual leader has made representations world wide to
raise violations of human rights by the Chinese in his country.
   "Tibetans are, at best, second class citizens in their own
country. Deprived of all basis democratic rights and freedoms, they
exist under a colonial administration in which all real power is
wielded by Chinese Communist party and the army," he told IPS.
   The International Student Festival in Trondheim will bring more
than 500 students from 100 countries to what is Europe's most
comprehensive student conference with debate meetings, academic
seminars, work groups and concerts, all on a human rights theme.
   The festival has its own newspaper and will run their own radio
station during the festival. ISFiT is a non-profit festival
financed mainly by the University of Trondheim and Norwegian
government departments and agencies.

CARIBBEAN:  REGIONAL WOMEN ACTIVELY OPPOSING VATICAN'S
            UNCOMPROMISING POSITION AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS

By Sheila Rampersad
   PORT OF SPAIN, July 31 (IPS) -- Women's groups in the Caribbean
have joined the international women's movement in opposing the
Vatican's uncompromising anti-abortion position and have insisted
that population policy cannot be discussed in isolation from
reproductive rights and therefore women's rights.
   "Unsafe abortions are a major cause of death, therefore access
to safe abortion should be an integral part of reproductive health
services," says a non-governmental organisation position paper that
will be presented at the World Women's Conference in China next
year.
   The position paper echoes the view of the Caribbean Association
for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA). The paper noted that Cuba
and Barbados are among the few Caribbean countries that have
decriminalized abortions. A draft bill to achieve this in Guyana
is currently before the Parliament there.
   CAFRA's voice is strong on the connection between reproductive
health and women's rights.
   "In the context of the upcoming International Conference on
Population and Development Caribbean governments should be urged
to actively resist attempts to reject the new framework of
reproductive health and rights which has been negotiated by most
governments, in support of the advocacy of the international
women's movement," the document states.
   The Caribbean's population and family planning experts will
support the CAFRA position this September at the Population
Conference to be held in Cairo, Egypt.
   The Caribbean's policy position states: "Unsafe abortion is also
one of the most neglected underlying causes of reproductive ill
health in the Caribbean and constitutes a major unrecognized social
health issue.
   "Women, adolescents and disadvantaged population groups are
particularly vulnerable to all aspects of reproductive ill health
and satisfactory outcomes cannot be achieved without the full
involvement of both men and women."
   The regional position, outlined in the Port of Spain
Declaration, calls for "the provision of appropriate information
and services in order to prevent unsafe abortions and to ensure
high-quality standards for abortion-related services for
individuals and couples."
   Although there are no data available on just how many illegal
abortions occur in the region, research by CAFRA member Nesha
Haniff shows that many women opt for the unsafe, backyard
procedure.
   According to Haniff, in Guyana, where health care is very poor
and where available, is costly, the rate of abortion is considered
extremely high, although no official figures exist.
   Abortion costs between almost seven dollars (900 Guyanese
dollars) and $15 (2,000 Guyanese dollars).
   "Women interviewed before their abortions said the health system
had failed them and this was being used as a contraceptive device.
They preferred a more long-term, uncomplicated contraceptive with
low maintenance. They had difficulty accepting abortion as an
alternative but wanted to exert control over the pregnancy. Condom
use was intermittent," Haniff said.
   Additionally because of its illegality, many women opt for folk
remedies for unwanted pregnancies.
   In St. Lucia, abortions are also illegal but unlike Guyana,
there is not the same tacit acceptance, according to Haniff.
   "The Catholic religion is very influential, advocating natural
contraceptive methods only and has been problematic for the St.
Lucia Planned parenthood Association," she said.
   In 1983, the crude birth rate was 30 per thousand and St.
Lucia's population was growing at the rate of two percent per
annum. High unemployment, compounded by rapid population growth and
a mounting dependency burden on the state led the government in
1990 to establish the National Population Unit.
   Arguing that reproductive rights are human rights, women's
groups in the Dominican Republic point out that an estimated 25 to
50 percent of maternal deaths in that country are a result of
illegal abortions.
   They estimate that approximately 70,000 women risk their lives
each year in back street procedures. They say that 40 percent of
births in the last five years were unwanted and that 17 percent of
women in a relationship have an unsatisfied demand for
contraceptives.
   Groups in Puerto Rico, where abortion is legalized, report that
since legalization, the number of deaths associated with abortion
has declined considerably.

BANGLADESH:  DHAKA QUIET DURING TWIN ANTI-NASREEN RALLIES

By Tabibul Islam
   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Leaders of right-wing Islamic groups
warned at two rallies in the Bangladesh capital July 29 that the
government would have to face the consequences if fugitive writer
Taslima Nasreen was not punished.
   Several thousand people mobilized to attend the twin rallies
called separately by the Jamaat-e-Islami and an alliance of 13
other radical parties, listened patiently as their leaders
threatened to launch demonstrations against the government.
   The fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islamic and the United Action
Council Alliance are separately campaigning for the hanging of the
controversial writer, to make Bangladesh an Islamic republic and
a ban on newspapers and organizations they call anti-Islamic.
   Though the twin rallies passed off uneventfully, security still
remains tight in Dhaka, which has been disturbed by nearly daily
protests, marches and demonstrations by opponents and supporters
of the controversial feminist author.
   The Alliance has given the Khaleda Zia administration seven days
to arrest Nasreen, who went into hiding on June 4 to escape an
arrest warrant and a fatwa for blasphemy.
   At least 100,000 people attended the Alliance rally, but the
much larger one was the rally of the Jamaat-e-Islami which was held
near the Baitulmukarram national mosque in Dhaka.
   Speakers at both the rallies described 32-year-old Nasreen as
a creation of India and the Western world.
   Jamaat chief Golam Azam thundered "Taslima Nasreen was an
unknown writer...she was created by the Western world and India to
malign Islam," he thundered.
   S.M. Suleiman of the Alliance urged the government to scrap all
treaties with India and boycott all Indian goods.
   However, Golam Azam, trying to strike a more balanced note, said
his party was keen on maintaining good relations with its giant
neighbor to the west. "But India must not encourage those attacking
Islam," he added.
   Religious extremists have accused India of supporting Nasreen,
who first raised a storm last year after the publication of her
book "Lajja" (Shame), a story of a Hindu family in Bangladesh
during the riots that swept the country in December 1992.
   The head of a then little-known radical group in the Bangladeshi
town of Sylhet issued a fatwa against Nasreen and a huge cash
reward.
   Nasreen was living under police protection in Dhaka until June
3 when a warrant for her arrest was issued by a Bangladeshi court
for her provocative interview to the Indian newspaper, The
Statesman.
   The English-language daily, published from Calcutta, quotes the
outspoken writer calling for a revision of the Koran. Nasreen has
said she was misquoted.
   Almost daily strikes and protests between Nasreen's opponents
and supporters, who believe she has the right to freedom of speech,
disrupted normal life in Bangladesh through June.
   The Bangladesh government is under pressure from the West to
protect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is being described as
the female Salman Rushdie.
   Nasreen is accused of "maliciously outraging the religious
feelings of Muslims", a charge the religious extremists insist must
be punished with death.

[] IN A NEW MOVE, USA PRESBYTERIANS
CONVENE REGIONAL CAMPING MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVES
TO PROBE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF WORKING TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY

92031            CAMP MINISTRY CONSULTATION SET

LOUISVILLE, Ky.--A first for the Presbyterian Church will be a
gathering of representatives from church camp and conference
centers across the denomination.

     The national conference centers, Montreat, Ghost Ranch and
Stony Point are well-known, but there are many others serving
presbyteries and synods throughout the church.  Associates from
many of these will gather Jan. 30 and Feb. 1.  Representatives from
ministry units and other entities will also attend.

     The event will be held at General Butler State Park, located
between Louisville and Cincinnati.

     The purpose of the consultation, which is called Weaving our
Ministry, is to explore mutual benefits for partnerships.  This
will include new ways in which the camp and conference group and
the national conference centers might better assist the units and
other groups within the church in carrying out their mission.  It
also will include ways for the General Assembly entities to make
more use of the centers.

     This gathering will help prepare Presbyterian camp and
conference representatives for participation in the Council on
Religiously Affiliated Camps Consultation, according to the Rev.
Ed Craxton, staff for the event.  That consultation will held in
the spring.  It is a division of the American Camping Association.

     Anyone interested in attending the consultation Jan. 30 should
contaxt Craxton at 100 Witherspoon Street, Louisville, KY  40202-
1396, (502) 569-5447.

[] EIGHT USA CHURCH DENOMINATIONS OPPOSE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

92032       STATEMENT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ANNOUNCED

PHOENIX--Eight denominational representatives including the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), recently signed a statement against
the death penalty in Arizona.  Signing for the Presbyterian Church
were the Rev. Robert V. Chapman, executive, Presbytery of the Grand
Canyon, and the Rev. Gary Skinner, executive, Synod of the
Southwest.  Other denominational leaders signing were from the
Episcopal Church, Roman Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, Society of Friends, United Church of Christ, the
Disciples of Christ and the Unitarian-Universalist.

     The statement said:

"At this time, when 102 persons in Arizona are on death row and an
execution appears imminent, we affirm our unity in opposing capital
punishment.  As Christian leaders we want to bear witness that the
death penalty cannot be justified as a legitimate tool of society's
justice system.  The denominations we represent in Arizona all have
spoken nationally against the death penalty.

"Christians of good will disagree on the use of the death penalty
as a means of achieving justice in our society.  We acknowledge
these differences of opinion.  We also join with all of our
brothers and sisters in their feelings of anger at heinous acts of
violence and in compassion for those among us whose loved ones have
been victims of such crimes.

"While there are many important sociological arguments against
capital punishment and while empirical evidence does not
demonstrate that executing prisoners has served to reduce crime,
our opposition relies principally on our faith vision of human
dignity and solidarity.

"As Christians and, indeed, as citizens of the United States, we
are proud of the mercy as well as justice which have so often
characterized our nation's history.  We believe that punishment
should be primarily redemptive, reformative and restorative.
Capital punishment does not lead us to these goals, either for the
victim or for the criminal.  The taking of one human life to serve
notice on the lives of others is in itself violent and cruel.  The
use of the death penalty is inconsistent with the Christian calling
to honor the sanctity of all of human life.  We must work to
curtail, not to promote, violence in our society by carrying the
message of God's redeeming love in all of our public and private
interactions.

"Jesus Christ, and countless historical examples, teach us that no
human being is beyond redemption.  The institutional taking of a
human life destroys forever the opportunity to seek reconciliation
of the offender and causes all of us to share in the violent act
of killing a person.  The judgment of life and death is God's
alone.  When one human being places himself or herself in the
position of making that judgment by murdering another human being,
it is a sin.  That sin is compounded when society responds in kind.

"There should be appropriate punishment for those who commit
crimes, however it is our firm conviction that to succumb to the
retaliatory violence of capital punishment is abdicating our
responsibility as Christians and as human beings.

"Our fervent prayer is that God's redemptive love will be better
served in human affairs through the abolition of this cruel and
inhuman form of punishment.  We pray, too, that society will find
more effective ways to serve the victims of crimes and their
families, offering them assistance to recover as completely as
possible from the harm they have suffered.  May the values of mercy
and compassion which have marked the best of our nation's history
overcome the spirit of vengeance epitomized in capital punishment."

[] FROM A COMMUNITY NEWSPAPER:
NORTH CAROLINIANS SHARE CHRISTMAS WITH FOREIGN STUDENTS

92028           FOREIGN STUDENTS SHARE CHRISTMAS

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This article appeared in The Herald, in Rock Hill,
S.C.  We thought our readers would enjoy reading it.--Marj
Carpenter

ROCK HILL, S.C.--Christmas week has been a time to rest and
celebrate the holidays for about 24 foreign students visiting the
Christmas International House at Bethelwoods Christian Education
Center.

     The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)-sponsored project provides
international students who can't get home for the holidays the
chance to spend that time with others.

     One of the students, Robson Gomes, 30, of Brazil also brought
along his wife and two daughters, who are with him while he's
studying in the United States, for the holiday experience.  He is
a student at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va.

     "This has been a time to rest, a time to be with family and
a time to think," Gomes said, "and to meet different people."

     Being at Bethelwoods and enjoying the natural beauty of the
area also has given him time to remember God, he said.

     "My girls love it.  They don't want to go home" to Richmond,
he said.

     Gomes will speak at Hermon Presbyterian Church in Rock Hill.

     "I won't preach.  I talk, sharing my experiences with God.
It's not like a sermon," he said, adding that he has been at the
seminary five months and expects to graduate in May 1994.

     Michihiko Ogata, 23, has been a graduate student in computer
science at Ohio University since March 1990.

     Relaxing in the game room at Bethelwoods after a tour of WRHI-
AM radio station and before a trip to the Outlet Market Place,
Ogata, a Tokyo native, talked a little about the differences
between Christmas in his country and here.

     "We don't celebrate Christmas like this.  We don't decorate
the tree.  We don't have a big tree," he said with a smile.  "We
can go to a restaurant or department store and see trees
decorated."

     The Japanese buy small artificial trees already decorated,
Ogata said.

     This is his second Christmas away from his family and he
misses them.  But - and he smiled again - he misses his dog more.

     Bethelwoods is one of only two Christmas International Houses
in the country that are operated out of a camp, said Joel Winchip
of Columbia, S.C., a student at the Presbyterian School of
Christian Education in Richmond.

     The Presbyterian church helps match foreign students in other
areas with host families.

     The students at Bethelwoods this year come from Japan, Taiwan,
Kenya, Brazil, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  They arrived Dec. 19
and return to campuses around the country the following week.

     They register for the International House by paying $25 fee
and list the first, second and third choices they would like to
visit, Winchip said.

     Since arriving, the students have visited churches including
Oakland Avenue Presbyterian in Rock Hill and First Presbyterian in
Lancaster.  They enjoyed a Christmas party at Tirzah Presbyterian
and were entertained by the Uriel Cloggers.

     The group also has visited Kings Mountain State Park and
toured the S.C. State Museum and Zoo.  On Christmas Day, they drove
up to Montreat, N.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Before they
leave, they will tour Brattonsville, Discovery Place and the
Charlotte Observer Omnimax Theatre.

     The project is supported by Providence Presbytery, with 18
churches providing money and food for the students.

[] SCRIPT OF 'WEEKENDER', THE USA PRESBYTERIAN PHONE RECORDING:
UPDATE ON ZAIRE, HAITI, JANUARY 10-17, 1992

             WEEKENDER #124 - JANUARY 10 - 17, 1992

     Greetings from Louisville, Kentucky.  This is Betsey Kandle
for Weekender.

     Many Presbyterian mission co-workers have been hindered in
their work by political coups and civil wars that have made it
necessary for some to return to the United States.  Two nations
in particular, Zaire and Haiti, have suffered profound political
strife which is still going on.

     Tom and Noretta Clayton were forced to leave their home in
Haiti last October.  Tom Clayton spoke about his adopted country
at a worship service at the Presbyterian Center in Louisville
this week.  Here are some of his thoughts.


     "This is a time filled with confusion and rumors when your
prayers for the people of Haiti are badly, badly needed.
Meanwhile, Presbyterian work goes on, limited, but goes on.

     "The last 200 years, has seen Haiti stripped of 80% of its
forests.  Nature continues to tear at what is left of the
country.  Today, Haiti is a land of rocks and barren mountains,
with only small pockets of lush, green, life.

     "But, in a small area near the Dominican Republic border,
the people have built an irrigation canal, a project called
Chadev, with the help of mission funds from the Presbyterian
Church.  Now after ten years, they are reaping a harvest of
better and more plentiful food.  And their work continues, or at
least will when things settle down.

     "In the district of Cormiers, the people have organized
themselves and are working to reclaim a watershed area that is
home for thousands with the help of Presbyterian missionaries and
mission funds.  This project is truly ecumenical - it includes
the local Episcopal and Catholic parishes, an Evangelical School
and a small clinic run by the Catholic Little Brothers.  Rodney
Babe, a Presbyterian agriculturalist, and his wife will be
working with the project when it is appropriate for them to
return.  They left when we did in early October.  My wife, Nory,
serves as administrator of the project and liaison between the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti.

     "Today, on the island of LaGonave, in the middle of the bay,
there is a small clinic established by the local Episcopal parish
under the leadership of Pere Valdema and with the assistance of
mission funds from the Presbyterian Church.  Nory and I work very
closely with that group.  With the help of a small group of
dedicated community health workers, trained at Hospital Ste.
Croix and working with the people of the Episcopal Church located
next to the clinic, they are working to provide both
preventative and curative care to a population of more than
10,000 people.

     "In the city of Cap Haitian, there is a trade school
teaching a variety of skills in a three year course, with an
enrollment of 500.  In the country, near the city, there is an
Agricultural School with demonstration lands, teaching people to
teach agriculture.  Both of these schools are assisted by mission
funds from the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).

     "And on the southern coast of the country, in a small
village called Leogane, there is the Hospital Ste. Croix.
Started by missionaries and mission funds from the Presbyterian
Church in the early 1960's, it is now staffed entirely by
Haitians and is held as a model of what health care in Haiti can
be.  Dr. David McNeeley, a Presbyterian missionary and Episcopal
priest is the medical director.  His wife, Dr. Marise McNeeley,
also a Presbyterian missionary heads the laboratory and blood
bank.  The Drs. McNeeley are still in Haiti and although the
hospital staff has been cut in half, they are still providing
what care they can to the people of the surrounding area.  My
wife and I continue to work as consultants in pharmacy,
procurement, and administration to the hospital.

     "But we want you to understand that it is not just mission
funds or missionaries or even Haitians that get this work done.
It is through God's Grace and your prayers that His work is done.
Thank you from the people of Haiti."

[] SCRIPT FOR 'WEEKENDER', USA PRESBYTERIAN PHONE MESSAGE SERVICE:
MORE ON HAITI, ESPECIALLY CHURCH WORLD SERVICE EFFORTS AMONG REFUGEES

              WEEKENDER #125 -- JANUARY 17-24, 1992

     Greetings from Louisville, Kentucky.  This is Gregg Kapfhammer
for Weekender.

     Thousands of Haitians took to the sea in small boats last
October following the takeover of their country by the military.
They risked their lives in search of freedom and security, were
caught by the U.S. Coast Guard, and would have been returned to
Haiti except for a court restraining order which is now under
appeal by the Justice Department.  They are confined in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, awaiting the resolution of their destiny.

     As it always does, the church is reaching out to the refugees
through organizations such as Church World Service and Witness and
the U.S. Catholic Conference.  And it is speaking out to Congress
and the Administration, urging justice for the Haitians.

     Dale S. DeHaan, director of the Church World Service
Immigration and Refugee Program, testified before a congressional
immigration sub-committee last November.  He strongly urged
Congress not to allow the administration to return Haitian refugees
to their country by force.  He reminded them of the Immigration Act
of 1990 which authorizes the Attorney General to grant Temporary
Protected Status to nationals from countries experiencing war,
natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions that endanger
physical safety.  While DeHaan acknowledged that such a grant is
not always the appropriate or necessary response to refugee crises,
he urged that this protection be extended to the Haitians.

     The Church World Service Immigration and Refugee Program is
attempting to resettle 600 of the nearly 1200  Haitians determined
by the government to have a reasonable claim for asylum in the
United States.  Presbyterian churches interested in helping to
resettle Haitian families are encouraged to call the Presbyterian
World Service office in the Social Justice and Peacemaking Ministry
Unit.  The number is 502-569-5840.  Social Justice and Peacemaking
is assisting this program with funds designated for the asylum
program.  To contribute, send gifts through the normal receiving
channels.  Mark them for the Haitian Crisis.

     That concludes this Weekender report.  To speak with someone
about Presbyterian concerns, call this number, 1-800-UP2DATE, from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday.

We invite you to place your comments on this WEEKENDER segment in

NEWS IN BRIEF
FOR CIRCUIT WRITER,
THE UNITED METHODIST COMPUTER COMMUNICATION SERVICE

                                       Jan. 17, 1992

   Of the 50 active U.S. United Methodist bishops, 34 have signed
statements supporting transfers of U.S. bishops across geographically
determined jurisdictional lines, reflecting a never-before-used church
provision.  Eleven said they meet requirements for such transfers and
are willing to serve "wherever assigned," and another 23 active bishops
and 19 retired bishops signed the appeal in support of their colleagues.

   The Rev. Zdravko Beslov, a United Methodist pastor and conference
superintendent in Bulgaria, will become the 15th person to receive the
1992 World Methodist Peace Award in recognition of his efforts to bring
reconciliation and healing in his country.

   United Methodist Bishop Felton E. May, Harrisburg, Pa., Jan. 10 called
on U.S. faith communities to set aside 10 percent of their budgets and
reserve funding "over and above what we are already doing" to fight "the
spiritual crisis" of drugs and violence.  The money, May told the (U.S.)
President's Drug Advisory Council, could "serve as a pump primer" until
"redirected government funds reach the points of need."

   Hope was voiced to U.S. United Methodists visiting Cuba recently that
the U.S. government could be convinced to end its embargo against Cuba.
The Rev. Pedro Mayor, a Cuban Methodist pastor, said that the United
States should at least allow shipment of food and medicine.  Bishop Joel
Ajo of the Methodist Church in Cuba said the blockade is "denying
medicine for our own children and our sick elderly."  The United
Methodist General Conference in 1984 called for lifting the embargo.

   Thousands of boxes of food are being packed in New Windsor, Md., by
volunteers under auspices of the United Methodist Committee on Relief
for shipment by ocean freight to for hungry residents of Moscow.
Additional volunteers to handle the packing are needed.

   United Methodist Bishop David J. Lawson, Sun Prairie, Wisc., and
members of his cabinet have voiced grave concern about membership
recruitment efforts by the Ku Klux Klan in the southeastern part of the
state.  Church members are called on to "make clear that the teaching
and values of the Klan are unacceptable in our communities."

   A dispute between United Methodist-related Boston University and
Coretta Scott King about possession of 83,000 documents of the late Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. must go to trial March 2, a Massachusetts state
judge ruled Jan. 12.  The civil-rights leader's widow has sought return
of papers, while university officials claim King entrusted the papers
to the school with an understanding they would become university
property at his death.  King, who held a doctorate degree from the
university, was assassinated in 1968.

   The Rev. Miron A. Morrill, 93, who was inducted into the United
Methodist Association of Communicators' Hall of Fame in November, died
Jan. 9 in Hesston, Kan., after a lengthy illness.  Morrill directed
press relations for the 1939 Uniting Conference in which three Methodist
bodies became the Methodist Church, and served in 1929-40 in various
posts for the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predecessor body of the
United Methodist Church.  Services were held Jan. 11 in Hesston.  He is
survived by his widow, Naomi.

ROUNDUP OF GENERAL UNIT BORAD MEETINGS   91b-118

December 11, 1991   Contact: Clifford L. Willis
      INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (DNS) -- Two Ohio women will lead the
boards of directors for the higher education and overseas
ministries units of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) for
the next two years.
      The Rev. Robin E. Hedgeman of Elyria was installed in
November as chairwoman of the Division of Overseas Ministries
board of directors. Hedgeman, associate regional minister for the
Christian Church in Ohio, will lead the DOM governing board until
1993.
      The Rev. Linda Walling of Cleveland is the new chairwoman
for the Division of Higher Education board of directors. Walling,
an associate minister at Heights Christian Church, succeeds the
Rev. Kenneth L. Teegarden of Fort Worth. Hedgeman's and Walling's
appointments are among the highlights of a month-long round of
meetings of general unit governing boards.
      The DOM board also approved six persons for overseas
appointments and named Disciples Africa executive, the Rev. Dan C.
Hoffman, acting executive director of the Common Ministry in
Africa. Hoffman will direct the overseas missions activities for
the DOM and the United Church Board for World Ministries.
      Holly Stovall of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve for two years
with the Disciples of Christ in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she
will work in a day-care center and other outreach ministries.
      Virginia Wilson, Olympia, Wash., was appointed to a two-year
term with the Japan-North America Commission on Cooperative
Mission. She will teach English in a church-related school or
institution in Japan.
      Elvira Likay Arndt, Dr. Joyce Baker and the Rev. John Huegel
were ratified for Common Ministry appointments in Ecuador,
Honduras and Mexico. In other action, Nancy Moulin, Reno, Nev.,
was assigned to a three-year appointment with the United Mission
to Nepal where she will direct the Andhi Khola Project.
      In action taken by the boards of other general units, the
Rev. Raymond E. Brown of Indianapolis has been named interim
president of the Church Finance Council. He succeeds the Rev.
James P. Johnson who becomes president of the Christian Church
Foundation in January 1992. Brown retired in November as senior
vice-president of the Board of Church Extension.
      The Disciples of Christ Historical Society in November
closed its 50th anniversary celebration with a special lecture
series. Richard Harrison of Vanderbilt Divinity School and Douglas
Foster of Abilene (Texas) Christian University addressed the
lecture theme: "Holding Back the Tide: T.B. Larimore and J.W.
McGarvey in the Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ
Division."
      The board of directors, meeting in conjunction with the
lectures, also approved for 1993 an expansion and redesign of the
quarterly journal "Discipliana"; and set Wilson, N.C., as the site
for the 1993 Forrest F. Reed Lectures. The Rev. Kenneth Henry of
the Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Ga., will be
the guest lecturer and will address historic aspects of the Black
Disciples of Christ movement.
      Trustees of the National Benevolent Association recently
approved the purchase of two care facilities for older adults, and
authorized expansion projects involving Robin Run Village in
Indianapolis, and the Beasley Building - home offices for NBA and
the Division of Higher Education - in St. Louis.
      The acquisitions of Village at Skyline at Colorado Springs,
Colo., and Patriot Heights in San Antonio, Texas, bring to 72 the
number of care facilities related to the NBA.
      The Division of Homeland Ministries board, in its recent
meeting, dealt primarily with staff and division restructure and
budget matters, including staff salary increases. Also on the
agenda was a review of the process leading the division to
reorganize into three "ministry centers" intended to focus its
programs more effectively upon congregational ministry.

[] FROM DISCIPLES NEWS SERVICE:
"SEARCH FOR SPIRITUALITY" TO BROADCAST ON ABC-TV   91b-119

December 11, 1991   Contact: Clifford L. Willis
      NEW YORK, N.Y. (DNS) -- As Americans prepare to address the
quincentary of Columbus' journey to this land, another voyage of a
different kind is being acknowledged . . .  a journey in search of
the spirituality of this nation and its people.
      Intrigued by the seeming emergence of a cultural phenomenon,
the National Council of Churches is documenting the revitalization
of American spirituality in the fourth program of the "Vision and
Values" series on ABC-TV. The program, "Search for Spirituality,"
will be broadcast to ABC affiliates on January 19, 1992. It will
air locally at 1:30 p.m. on WRTV, Channel 6.
      It has been rumored in the media that the movement of
Americans back to church and religion may well mark the popular
trend of the `90s. "Search for Spirituality" probes the questions
that surround the suggestion. Is spirituality just another decade
motif to ring out a century that was marked in the `60s with
revolution, the `70s with drugs, and the `80s with money? Or is it
the bona fide search of a society in pursuit of the boundaries of
collective harmony and corrective healing?
      "There is no question that we're finding a spiritual hunger
from people of all walks of life," said the Rev. Theodore
Nottingham, director of video production for the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), an NCC member communion and program
cosponsor.
      "Unfortunately some people look outside the church for what
is truly the church's mission," Nottingham said. "In a way the
church itself is on a search for spirituality. This search is key
to the church's revitalization."
      "Search of Spirituality" journeys across the country to
document the answers. In California, over 200 people representing
a wide range of faith groups celebrate new ways of worship through
creation-centered rituals. In Chicago, an African-American
Lutheran congregation gives witness to the power and joy of
communal spirituality. In Iowa, 5,000 Presbyterian women gather to
construct new images of God and the church. In New York, 100
Vietnam veterans convene for a retreat at the direction of
Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh to bind the wounds of war into
banners of inner and global peace.
      From gurus to grassroots, spirituality speaks to the seekers
who are redefining their lives under the rubric of personal
transformation and societal renewal. In the process, three central
questions emerge to prod the spiritual quest: Who am I? Who is my
neighbor? Who is God? The journey continues as the answers to each
of these questions unravel the harsh realities of individual lives
and interweaves the responses to form new images of self, neighbor
and God.
      "Search for Spirituality" was produced for the National
Council of Churches by Current Production Group. The
producer/director is John Ankele, and Mary Byrne Hoffman of the
National Council of Churches is the executive producer.

[] FROM DISCIPLES NEWS SERVICE:
STATUS OF MISSIONARIES IN ZAIRE   91b-120

December 11, 1991
Contact: Clifford L. Willis
      INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (DNS) -- The status of nine Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ) missionaries previously stationed in
Zaire has been reevaluated in light of the deteriorating political
and economic situation in the Central African nation.
      Zaire's situation "appears to be moving beyond the critical
stage to chaos," said the Rev. Dan C. Hoffman, Africa executive
for the Disciples' overseas ministries division. "We cannot in
good conscience, leave our staff uncertain about their status and
the possibility of future service.
      "While we are concerned about the lives and ministries of
our overseas staff, we also care deeply about our brothers and
sisters in Zaire," Hoffman said. "We don't know what the future
will bring, but believe an already-difficult situation will
worsen. We ask North American Disciples to join us in prayer for
the church in Zaire as well as for the people."
      Beginning January 1, two missionaries will start terminal
home leave, five will be on home leave until new assignments
develop and two will maintain modified relationships with Zaire.
Those persons affected by the changes are:
      - Amy Hirsch, Tucson, Ariz., and Lois Hodrick, Oakland,
Calif., whose terms end June 30, 1992 and April 30, 1992, will
finish their terms here in the United States.
      - Saul and Maria Falcon will remain in Coronel Oviedo,
Paraguay, on home leave through June 30, 1992. The couple may
return to Zaire or be reassigned elsewhere in Africa, Latin
America or the Caribbean.
      - Daniel and Sandra Gourdet will be on home leave in
Birmingham, Ala., through August 31, 1992, while another
assignment is explored for them in another African nation.
      - Michael Allen, Erie, Pa., is now based in Brazzaville,
Congo, where he will attempt to relate to Zairian churches,
organizations and hospitals in Mbandaka.
      - Robert and Gertrud Muller will continue to be based in
Offerdingen, Germany. Robert Muller will make frequent trips to
the Church of Christ in Zaire's architectural office.
      These changes were approved in November by the Division of
Overseas Ministries board of directors.

[] MISSIONARIES TELL UNITED METHODIST MISSION BOARD OF THEIR WORK

20(10-21-71)                                        Jan. 16, 1992

Mission Interns Share Stories
with Board of Global Ministries


     NEW YORK (UMNS)--When Natasha Kanhai, a United Methodist from
Wisconsin, started working at a slum project in Bombay, India, she
felt frustrated by her lack of ability to communicate.

     The people of the slums spoke a wide variety of languages.
One day, on a field trip to a park, no one could translate.
     Then something happened.  By patching together different
languages, she managed to talk with four women resting in the
shade.  She learned, she said, "to communicate with the heart."

     Kanhai was one of 17 United Methodist mission interns who
shared their stories Jan. 16 at the United Methodist Board of
Global Ministries headquarters here.  Fourteen of them have
returned from 16-month foreign assignments and are starting U.S.
placements.  Three interns had taken a one-year foreign assignment.

     In Zimbabwe, Africa, Don Wilson of South Carolina learned the
"people's theology," which is, he explained, "when you're willing
to step into their situation and see the world from their point of
view," including other perspectives of God.

     Kai Jackson of Georgia, also assigned to Zimbabwe, witnessed
"the power of African women organizing for their own economic
independence."  Jackson's contribution included sponsoring a
doll-making workshop.

     Gina Chamberlain of Illinois turned the frightening experience
of being robbed of a gold cross necklace on the streets of Nairobi,
Kenya, into an examination of what action was being taken to help
the street children who robbed her.

     She realized that merely talking about issues or "going to a
seminar on the debt crisis or on street children didn't affect
those children at all."

     The Board of Global Ministries' three-year mission intern
program--for adults 22-30--combines work and study experiences with
the goals of community-building and cross-cultural interaction.
Participants bring back a new understanding of mission and the
search for justice and become resources for the church.

     Joanne Reich of Florida and Jane Eesley of Illinois, who were
both in Jerusalem, said they saw the everyday life of Palestinians
in a different way than that portrayed by U.S. media.

     Eesley also was concerned with the lack of U.S. Christian
attention to the Palestinians, some of whom are Christian.
"Tremendous numbers of Christians who visit the Holy Land," she
explained, make the trip to "visit stones, not people."

     In the same way, Elizabeth Dillard of Illinois and Allen
Vaughan of Missouri learned of internal refugees and human-rights
violations in the Philippines.

     And beyond the headlines of Eastern Europe, Lonnie Chafin of
Virginia worked at a center in Hungary housing 40 refugees--of
varying ethnic groups--from the war in Yugoslavia. "Instead of
(using) violence, they chose to be a community," he said.

     Carrie Lee of Washington and Pamila Lew of Ohio, assigned to
Korea, and Dinah Hall of California, who went to Japan, said they
came away more enlightened about the United States and those
countries and about the relationships between the countries.

     Holly Randolph of California, Maribel Mojica of Puerto Rico,
Marcia Chamberlain of Virginia and Bert Gardner of North Carolina
all spoke of what they learned from the poor in Latin America.

     Children in South Africa taught Laura Butterbaugh of Illinois
about faith.  She recounted a story about trying to work with a
family of 10 orphaned children--who had seen their parents
killed--and not finding anything to interest them again in life.
Singing Christian songs helped the children to revive with joy.

     "I realized how much strength they got from Jesus and Jesus'
teaching," she said.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF BEGINS A NEW YEAR

LWR BOARD REORGANIZING FOR A NEW YEAR             1/17/92

     At the January 13-14 meeting of the LWR board, elections were held.
Robert Marshall (ELCA) was re-elected as president, Will L. Herzfeld (ELCA)
as vice-president, Norman D. Sell (LCMS) as secretary, and Walter Jensen as
treasurer.  Charles Lutz (ELCA) and Will L. Herzfeld (ELCA) were re-elected
unanimously to their positions on the board.  The Reverend Richard L.
Krenzke (LCMS) was elected as a Director replacing Dr. Eugene Linse (LCMS)
upon Linse's retirement from the board, which was announced this week.

     The Reverend Krenzke comes to the LWR board with various talents.
Educated at the University of Chicago, School of Social Service
Administration and Concordia Theological Seminary from which he was
ordained into the ministry of LCMS, Krenzke has spent the subsequent years
working in ways that best utilize his combined talents.  Recently elected
executive director of the LCMS board for Social Ministry Services, Krenzke
will assume his position on the LWR board with an April orientation and
then a June board meeting and retreat to be held in Seattle, Washington.

     "The best pan-Lutheran agency in America" were the words Eugene W.
Linse (LCMS) used to describe LWR in his closing comments to the board upon
his retirement from that body.  Linse has served the board since December
1982 as one of the 4 LCMS representatives.  LWR is thankful for his service
and appreciated his guidance in establishing and monitoring LWR's adherence
to by-laws and policy.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF CALLS CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE PUZZLING

LWR RESPONDS TO NEW CHALLENGES                    1/17/92

  Lutheran World Relief executive director Dr. Norman E. Barth in his
annual report to the board described the whirlwind of events in Eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States and the subsequent public
response and relief efforts as "a puzzlement."  He said storage and
distribution of relief supplies are difficult, as is targeting the needy in
those areas.

      Cognizant of the priority on the "poorest of the poor" that LWR has
always upheld, a decision has been carefully made.  LWR's focus will not be
diminished but some response to the call for aid in Eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States will be initiated.  A $20,000 grant to
Lutheran World Federation (LWF) was announced by Barth informing the Board
that part of it has already been used to transport 20 tons of food and
clothes to Yugoslavia.  This represents an initial contribution to LWR's
recently established Eastern European Fund.  Individuals may contribute to
this fund.

      Barth also reported that the impact of the first peace in Ethiopia
and Eritrea in 30 years is widening but that much rehabilitative work
remains to be done in the area.  In the past year, LWR completed delivery
to Eritrea and Tigray of more than 150,000 MT of food provided by US A.I.D.
Approximately 800,000 people were sustained during 1991 with this food.
Through the Emergency Relief Desk in Ethiopia and its newly opened office
in Asmara, LWR will continue to monitor the rehabilitative work in this
area but will not be so deeply involved in food aid in the future.

     An LWR partner agency in Nicaragua heralded for its work on peace and
reconciliation, a focus of LWR's, was highlighted by Dr.  Barth.  CEPAD
(Evangelical Committee for Development in Nicaragua) has trained more than
50 local ecumenical peace missions.  Respected by both parties in the
conflict-ridden areas of Nicaragua, these missions are able to mediate
satisfactory resolutions, especially concerning land rights.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF ASSESSES USA GOVERNMENT ATTITUDES
TOWARDS NEEDS IN EASTERN EUROPE, HORN OF AFRICA; OTHER AREAS NOTED

LWR WASHINGTON STAFF TELL THE STORY               1/17/92

     U.S. government aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States has not
come at the expense of poorer countries, said Carol Capps, representative
for development policy for Church World Service and Witness/Lutheran World
Relief.  Ms. Capps, reporting to the board of directors of Lutheran World
Relief, said that while third world needs have never been a high priority
in Congress, the U.S. government appears to realize that the magnitude of
suffering in the republics of the former Soviet Union is on a different
scale than that in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.

     Ms. Capps also reported on U.S. policy toward the Horn of Africa,
noting that the international community appears paralyzed by the violence
in Somalia, which continues to destroy lives and property.  Governments and
humanitarian agencies have found it difficult to operate in the country, as
anarchy set in after the fall last year of President Siad Barre.  In
neighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. has been slow to provide development aid due
to overdue repayments on military loans dating to the time of Haile
Selassie, in the early 1970s.  Congressional action which would permit
development aid to the new government of Ethiopia failed when an overall
foreign aid bill was not passed in November.  The executive branch could
permit such development aid and is currently going through the steps
necessary to effect a waiver of the Congressional prohibition (Brooke
amendment) of such development aid.

     Ms. Capps introduced Paul Nelson who gave an update on U.S. policy
relating to African recovery and development.  Mr. Nelson and his wife
Paola Scommegna recently joined the Washington staff in policy analysis and
communications.

     In addition to the report from Ms. Capps, the board heard reports from:

     board member Bishop Harold Skillrud of Atlanta on his
     board- mandated monitoring trip to East Africa.
     Describing the "exquisite beauty, grinding poverty and
     concentrated joy" he found in Kenya, Tanzania and
     Zimbabwe, he commended the dedication of LWR staff and
     partners in working to ease human suffering.  In an
     accompanying slide show, Skillrud showed slides of a
     Tanzanian woman who, ten years ago, lived in a small
     home made of bark and thatch.  Thanks to a grant of an
     in-calf heifer, the woman has managed to raise a small
     herd of cattle, increasing the nutrition level of her
     family, and building a brick home with a tin roof.  She
     also has passed on the gift of her heifer to others so
     that they may benefit.

     board member Charles Lutz of Minneapolis.  Lutz
     reported on his trip to monitor LWR work in Israeli
     Occupied Territories, saying the Gaza Strip was "the
     most depressing place on earth, with a feeling of
     gloom."  With Israelis and Palestinians currently in
     negotiations, Lutz found guarded hope among Palestinian
     contacts for the prospects of peace.

     the president of the board.  Robert Marshall encouraged
     board members who are so inclined to write their
     representatives and urge them to make the 10 billion
     dollar loan guarantee that Israel is requesting
     contingent on certain criteria; namely, that there be a
     moratorium on all Israeli settlement-building, that the
     peace process not be disrupted and that human rights
     abuses be decreased.

     the board members on the Middle East.  A "sense of the
     board" was adopted without objection where by it was
     agreed that LWR would not join in any letter advocating
     the passage of the $10 billion loan guarantee to Israel
     without "iron-clad assurances of a freeze on all
     Israeli settlement-building in the occupied
     territories.

     LWR staff on its trial period of direct mail.  Working
     with representatives of the Lutheran Church-Missouri
     Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
     LWR has recently initiated a direct mail appeal program
     corresponding only with individuals who have given
     directly to LWR in the past.  To date, LWR has spent
     less than 8 cents to raise each dollar under the direct
     mail program.  With an overall response rate of 9.5%,
     LWR is encouraged by the results.

     Middle East and Asia Program Director.  In his
     presentation to the LWR board, the Reverend Gene
     Thiemann, donned a gas mask to make two points.  With a
     voice muffled by the mask, he talked first about the
     LWR funds that were used to purchase gas masks for the
     Augusta Victoria Hospital staff in Jerusalem when the
     Persian Gulf war raged. Second, Thiemann talked about
     the need to really listen to the voices that get
     muffled by warfare, natural disaster and civil strife.
     He challenged LWR to amplify and clarify the voices of
     the poor.

DELEGATION ACCOMPANIES SALVADORAN BISHOP HOME
90-1-1-FI

     CHICAGO (ELCA) - The Rev. Medardo Gomez, bishop of the
Lutheran Church of El Salvador, plans to return to El Salvador
from exile in Guatemala to celebrate the Feast of Epiphany, Jan.
6-8.  An ecumenical delegation, including the vice president and
three bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, is
accompanying Gomez in El Salvador to ensure his safety.
     Gomez intends to enter San Salvador Jan. 6 to hold an
Epiphany service at Resurrection Lutheran Church, where he is the
pastor.  He will also participate in worship at the Roman
Catholic Cathedral with Archbishop Rivera y Damas and in an
ecumenical service at the Oscar Romero chapel at the Central
American University.
     ELCA Vice President Christine Grumm of San Francisco, Bishop
David C. Wold of the  Southwestern Washington Synod, Bishop Peter
Rogness of the Greater Milwaukee Synod and Bishop Wayne E.
Weissenbuehler of the Rocky Mountain Synod are included in the
delegation escorting Gomez in his homeland.
     The ELCA selected several delegation members, said the Rev.
James E. Henneberger, area secretary for Latin America in the
ELCA Division for Global Mission.  "Some had been there before.
They are people we feel are astute enough to be objective but
also to be sensitive to the subtleties of what they see and
hear."
     Gomez had asked the ELCA and the Salvadoran Humanitarian
Aid, Research and Education Foundation of Washington, D. C., to
organize the ecumenical delegation.  SHARE is a non-profit
organization founded in 1981 to provide aid to refugees and
displaced people in El Salvador.
     Henneberger expressed plans for the ELCA, through his
office, to organize ecumenical delegations on a regular basis to
visit El Salvador.
     Death threats against Gomez and accusations that he
participated in "subversive military activities" prompted him to
leave El Salvador Nov. 25.  He set up offices in Guatemala City,
Guatemala, and indicated his intention to return to his country
as soon as possible.
     Gomez has accused "the armed forces of El Salvador" of
several acts of oppression against the Lutheran, Roman Catholic,
Episcopal, Baptist and Mennonite churches, as well as the
Ecumenical Coordination of Churches there.  Lutheran church
workers have been arrested, searched, threatened and deported.
     Other members of the delegation are Episcopal Bishop Roger
White of Milwaukee; Eileen Purcell, executive director of SHARE;
the Rev. Gustav Schultz, of Berkeley, Calif., an ELCA pastor and
president of the SHARE Foundation; the Rev. Arthur F. McGovern, a
Jesuit priest and professor of philosophy at the University of
Detroit; the Rev. Robert McAfee Brown, a Presbyterian theologian
from the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif.; the Rev.
Miguel Palacios of the Episcopal Diocese of Guatemala City; Eric
Popkin, Wisconsin Council of Churches; and Mary Beth Murphy, a
reporter for the Milwaukee Sentinel.

STUDENTS DISCUSS FAITH AND SCIENCE
90-1-2-DM

     ST. LOUIS (ELCA) -- Nearly 300 Lutheran college students
welcomed in the last decade of a century that has been marked by
a revolution in high technology with a conference on issues of
faith and science.
     The students came here from about 80 different universities
for a conference held Dec. 28-Jan. 1.  The conference "Stewards
of Technology Responding to God's Call,"  was sponsored by the
Lutheran Student Movement-USA.
     "The most important thing we can do is bring the Christian
value of cooperation into our communities...that will do more for
technology than all the high technology we can use," said keynote
speaker Dr. Rustum Roy, a leading U.S. materials scientist
involved in the first Vatican and National Council of Churches
discussions of science and religion.
     "Don't attack anybody, just go ask everybody a lot of
questions in a Woody Allen fashion," he said.  Roy is professor
of the solid state and professor of geochemistry at Pennsylvania
State University, University Park, PA.  He also serves as
director of the university's Science, Technology and Society
Program.
     "Newness is the principal character of godliness and chance
is its principal agent on earth," said Roy in calling students to
"prayerful, thoughtful, careful experimenting with life."
     "Rippling through the whole scheme is a magnificent,
glorious, unifying and loving experience that we in the West have
called God," said a second keynote speaker, Dr. George K.
Schweitzer, alumni distinguished professor of chemistry at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
     "I do not know how love expresses him or herself out there
in the universe," he said.  "I do know God is and has been
communicating everywhere."
     In plenary action, students passed resolutions in favor of
conserving water, being accepting of non-Christians and combating
racism.  They narrowly defeated a resolution supporting the
humane use of animals in biomedical research and testing.
     Students attended workshops and worship services which
centered on faith and science issues.  They also visited the zoo
and botanical gardens in St. Louis.
     "We are the future leaders of our churches, and by exposing
us now to the problems of tomorrow it starts our minds turning,"
said Bill Neumyer of Palmyra, Pa., who was elected LSM president
for 1990.  Newmyer is beginning graduate work in nuclear
engineering at the University of Tennessee.  He is a recent
graduate from Penn State.
     The Lutheran Student Movement-USA is a pan-Lutheran student
group with members from several U.S. Lutheran denominations.  Its
annual conference is provided with major financial and staff
support from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

LIRS RECEIVES CONGRESSIONAL TRIBUTE
90-1-3-BB

     WASHINGTON -- Ten members of the U.S. Congress paid tribute
to Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service in remarks made in
the Senate and House at the start of LIRS's yearlong 50th
anniversary observance.
     Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommittee
on immigration and refugee affairs in the Senate, said LIRS was a
"phenomenal humanitarian agency.
     "LIRS has made the difference between lives of oppression
and deprivation and lives of hope and freedom for over 150,000
refugees from throughout the world," he said.
     Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., who chairs the House
subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law,
commended LIRS for "its efforts in organizing assistance for
children who are being kept in detention centers because of their
lack of legal status in this country."
     "While the LIRS does not seek recognition for its
humanitarian efforts, I rise today to commend them," said Sen.
Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.  "With the world's refugee population
estimated at 14 million, the work of organizations such as the
LIRS assumes an ever-increasing significance."
     Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., called LIRS "a vibrant organization
for 50 years."
     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said the more than 6,000
congregational sponsors that have joined LIRS in the resettlement
process, "also deserve praise for their untiring work in
accepting newcomers.  As the only refugee serving in the U.S.
Senate, I have a deep concern for the plight of refugees and
immigrants.  I have worked closely with LIRS in the past and look
forward to a continued close working relationship."  Boschwitz is
a member of LIRS's honorary 50th anniversary committee.
     Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said "It is the private
voluntary organizations like LIRS which are truly on the front
lines of refugee policy.  On both the local and international
level, private voluntary organizations help governments grapple
with the growing refugee problem."
     Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., noted the involvement of
LIRS "in efforts to chart a more humane immigration and refugee
policy within the United States and among the nations of the
world."
     Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., pointed out that LIRS is "one
of just two voluntary agencies that resettles unaccompanied
minors."  LIRS has placed more than 3,000 unaccompanied refugee
children in foster care since 1978.
     Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass., said that in Massachusetts
"the work of LIRS is well known and has added to the very fabric
of our life as a commonwealth."
     "The work of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service makes
Christ's words manifest and is a shining beacon of hope in a
world in which the lack of human compassion sometimes seems
overwhelming," Christ said that as you have done to the least of
these you have also done it unto me, said Rep. Timothy P.
Johnson, D-S.D.
     LIRS serves on behalf of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and Latvian Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America.  "Opening Doors" is the theme of its
anniversary observance which will continue until next fall.

Commentary: Religion as prophet to politics
RNS>17230

By A. James Rudin
Special to Religious News Service

   (Rabbi Rudin is national interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee.)

   (RNS) -- What in American life has historically played a key role
in shaping fundamental values of political leaders?
   Look for the answer in the early minutes of an upcoming television
program called "Democracy in America," an in-depth look at the lives
of Sen. Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Appearing briefly during the Markle Foundation-produced broadcast,
to be aired Oct. 11 on CNN, is the Missionary Baptist Church in
Carthage, Tenn., where Gore's spiritual life is rooted. It is the
church where his grandparents worshiped.
   And then, during a segment on Quayle, he says that "church on
Sunday" was a part of his upbringing in Huntington, Ind.
   These are but two examples of many in history that highlight the
strong influence of religion on our political process. It was an
aspect of the American scene that astonished French historical Alexis
de Tocqueville when he wrote a book called "Democracy in America" more
than a century ago.
   The connections have continued to amaze foreign visitors. The
United States is a highly industrialized First World country that
behaves religiously like a Third World nation. We have a legal barrier
between religion and government. Even though there is a legal
separation between religion and state, religion has been a critical,
often defining, factor in shaping the values of our political leaders.
   Throughout history, religious groups have stressed moral dimensions
of public issues, giving urgency and passion to politics. When leaders
sought independence from Great Britain, the cause was preached in
colonial pulpits.
   The abolitionist and pro-slavery movements were strongly supported
by religious leaders before the Civil War. And in this century, such
movements as prohibition, civil rights, sexual equality, the various
anti-war efforts and yes, family values, have all found a home in
church and synagogue.
   Religion's deep hold on the political imagination of most Americans
sets our country apart from others. High visibility at religious
services has traditionally been part of a U.S. president's job
description.
   Some consider the close ties a threat to the American republic. In
fact, they may be more a threat to religion. Many American political
leaders have abused religious symbols and language. And worse, they
have at times appropriated divine approval for ideology of their own
political parties.
   In the heat of a presidential election, it is important to remember
that God is neither a Republican nor a Democrat, not even an
independent.
   It is also important to recognize religion's proper functions in
society. One role, of course, is to develop permanent ethical values
in future leaders. Are the churches doing their job well? If Gore or
Quayle eventually becomes president, as five of our last nine vice
presidents have done, we may all learn the answer.
   But religion plays another important role in the political process:
to play the biblical prophet Nathan to King David, to be the
conscience of political leaders.
   Too often Jews and Christians have forgotten Nathan, who confronted
David with the seriousness of a moral lapse, and identified with the
dominant political values of society. Too often religion has been
deliberately manipulated by political leaders for their own ends.
   Writing 200 years ago, James Madison envisioned a robust role for
religion. He called for a "multiplicity of sects" in the public arena,
the better to achieve a balance between the compelling demands of
authentic religion and the complex political process.
   Each time we elect national leaders we are striking a new balance
for the future. It is an awesome but a necessary task.

Editor sues for wider access to Dead Sea Scrolls
RNS>17231

By David E. Anderson
Religious News Service
      (RNS) -- Herschel Shanks, the American editor who broke open a
fraternity of Dead Sea scholars to ensure wider access to the scrolls,
has gone to court to defend that access.
   Shanks, and the organization he heads, the Biblical Archaeology
Society, have filed suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia
against Israeli professor Elisha Quimron. The suit, filed Sept. 25,
seeks a declaration from the court that a part of the Scrolls
reconstructed by Quimron cannot be copyrighted.
   Quimron, a professor of Hebrew Language at Ben-Gurion University in
Israel, is currently a scholar in residence at the Annenberg Research
Institute in Philadelphia.
   Some eight months ago, Quimron successfully sought a temporary
injunction barring the society from publishing or distributing
anywhere in the world the two-volume book "A Facsimile Edition of the
Dead Sea Scrolls."
   The book, which contains an introduction by Shanks, was the result
of years of labor by him and others to break the hold a small group of
scholars has held on the scrolls since they were discovered in 1947 in
a cave in what is now Israel. Shanks' effort was intended to make the
documents more available to other researchers and the public.
   The documents are believed to have been written between 200 years
before and 50 years after the birth of Jesus.
   The ancient texts represent one of the most important manuscript
discoveries in the field of early rabbinic Judaism and the first years
of the Christian movement. The originals are kept at the Rockefeller
Museum in Jerusalem and research on them is done under the auspices of
the Israeli Antiquities Authority.
   Since the 1950s, a small group of scholars, now numbering just 15,
has controlled exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls and less
than half have been published.
   Last year, the Biblical Archaeology Society published its two-
volume work containing more than 1,750 photographic plates. The book
made the text of the scrolls widely available to scholars, researchers
and other interested parties.
   Part of the volumes included a 120-line portion of the
reconstructed text of an ancient document known as MMT, an acronym for
the Hebrew phrase "Miqsat Ma'aseh ha-Torah."
   The MMT text is believed to a foundation document of the Qumran
sect, a Jewish group that broke with the prevailing rabbinic Judaism.
   Although the text, amounting to about 120 lines in Quimron's
reconstruction, is 2000 years old, the Israeli scholar, who is
preparing the reconstructed text for publication, says he owns the
copyright on it. Publication in the society's two-voume work is an
infringement of that copyright, he contends.
   Shanks said that the Israeli court's injunction, if allowed to
stand, "would have very broad implications for all scholarship."
   "It's probably the first time where a scholar has claimed such a
copyright on an ancient text," he said in an interview with Religious
News Service.
   Shanks went on to note that the reconstructed Hebrew transcript of
the text, as pubished in the facsimile, is already in wide
circulation.
   "Virtually all scholars have this text," he said. "Classes have
been taught on it. He (Quimron) authorized numerous articles" on it.
In 1990, a Polish journal, "The Qumran Chronicle," published a 120-
line text of MMT.
   In the complaint filed in Philadelphia, Shanks compared the
reconstruction of the MMT text to the completion of a jigsaw puzzle.
The complaint said that "much, if not all," of the work of
reconstructing MMT has been completed by scholars other than Quimron.
He became involved in preparing MMT for publication only in 1980,
according to Shanks.
   When the reconstructed text is made available for study by scholars
it is expected to shed a great deal of light on the Qumran sect,
including its beliefs, religious laws and practices and the then-
prevailing practices of Judaism.
   Shanks and the archaeology society are asking the court to declare
that publishing a portion of the MMT did not infringe any copyright in
violation of Quimron's rights.
   Quimron has until mid-October to reply to the complaint.

Q&A: Answers to questions about religion
RNS>17232

By Religious News Service

   (Editor's note: The following is a weekly feature from RNS. See
note at the end, which invites reader participation.)


Color it ?

Q: What is the significance of the colors of vestments worn by
Catholic priests and some Protestant ministers when they preside over
a worship service?

A: Violet or purple symbolizes penitence and is used during the
two major penitential seasons of the church's liturgical year. Those
are Advent, leading up to Christmas, and Lent, leading up to Easter.
   Rose, which symbolizes joy during a period of penance, is worn on a
specific Sundays during each of those seasons.
   Red symbolizes the suffering, or passion, of Jesus Christ on the
cross, and is worn for services that recall it. They include Passion
Sunday (also called Palm Sunday) and Good Friday. Red is also worn on
Pentecost, the major feast associated with the Holy Spirit, and for
celebrations of the feasts of apostles and martyrs.
   White, symbolizing purity, is worn for holidays associated with
Christ, such as Christmas and Easter; for feasts commemorating the
Virgin Mary or saints who are not martyrs. White may also be worn for
funerals.
   Green, symbolizing hope and vitality of faith, is worn for
"ordinary time," those Sundays that do not fall into other categories.
   Liturgical colors were standardized by the Council of Trent in the
16th century. Before that, the use of colors varied from place to
place.
   In efforts to set themselves apart from Catholics, most Protestants
abandoned use of color in services during the Reformation. But many
have begun using it again in recent times.


Biblical wings

Q: How many birds are mentioned in the Bible?

A: About 50, far fewer than the 350 species known to inhabit
biblical lands. Leviticus 11:19 alone mentions more than a dozen,
including the eagle, vulture, osprey, buzzard, raven, ostrich, hawk,
sea gull, owl, water hen, stork, heron and hoopoe. The list identifies
birds of prey that are to be avoided because they are considered
"unclean."
   Of these, the least well-known on the list, the hoopoe, is a 12-
inch-long bird with a long, curving beak and hawking call. It has a
cinnamon or buff-colored body and a high, gold crest tipped with
black. Its back and wings are marked with black and white bands.
   The hoopoe, common in Africa and Eruope, forages for insects and
worms in manure piles, which accounts for its being labeled unfit to
eat.

   Readers are invited to submit questions about religion or
religious practices to: Questions, Religious News Service, P.O. Box
1015, Radio City Station, New York, N.Y. 10101.

Archbishop Roach scolds newspaper for series
RNS>17233

By Willmar Thorkelson
RNS Correspondent
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (RNS) -- Archbishop John R. Roach of the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has denounced the St. Paul
Pioneer Press for publishing excerpts from a book dealing with priests
and the sexual abuse of children.
   Among other cases, the book, "Lead Us Not Into Temptation" by Jason
Berry, recounts how the archdiocese and another Minnesota diocese
assigned the Rev. Thomas Adamson, an accused pedophile, to various
parishes despite reports he had abused boys.
   In a guest column in the St. Paul newspaper on Thursday, Roach said
the Berry excerpts, published as a series, raise "serious questions
about fairness and good journalistic practice."
   The information about Adamson "was simply a rehash of matters that
have been public and published by you," he said, in what amounted to
an open letter to the newspaper.
   "Media throughout the country, including the Pioneer Press, and
professionals in the field of sexual abuse have recognized that the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has been a leader in
correcting what we have admitted were serious flaws in the way we
addressed pedophilia cases several years ago," Roach wrote. "We
operated from ignorance, and we have paid the price.
   "More importantly, we have learned, and we have been called upon by
interfaith groups and others all across the country to share our
policies," which were published in the Pioneer Press in 1988, he said.
   He continued: "Your knowledge of that and your failure to strike a
balance by noting it in connection with this series raises questions
about fairness, and perhaps indicates bias."
   Roach said he had "resisted vigorously" the notion that Catholics
are victims of a biased media. Howver, he said, "the decision to run
this series gives considerable credence to the theory of prejudice and
bias.
   "This archdiocese has been a vital part of this community from its
very beginning. We have been responsible citizens and have a long
history of successful service to the community. We have been here
longer than the Pioneer Press, and we will be here after the Pioneer
Press.
   "As you know, over the years we have had meetings with the editors
of your paper to discuss a variety of issues. We work hard to be
cooperative with the local media.
   "If your intent was to embarrass us, you've done it. But the way in
which you did it says more about you than about us."

Catholic leader targets entertainment industry
RNS>17234

By David E. Anderson
Religious News Service
      (RNS) -- Cardinal Roger Mahony, head of the archdiocese of Los
Angeles, issued an unprecedented pastoral letter to the entertainment
industry on Wednesday, telling artists they have a moral obligation to
uphold "human values" but rejecting any censorship or production code.
   "Because I reject censorship, I do not propose a code to govern
what filmmakers may create, nor do I wish to dictate what intelligent
viewers may see," Mahony wrote in the 40-page letter. It was timed to
mark the fifth anniversary of Pope John Paul II's meeting with leaders
of the movie, television and recording industries during his trip to
the United States in 1987.
   While saying filmmakers are "rightly jealous" of their creative
freedom, the cardinal added: "But a moment's reflection will convince
them that the freedom they cherish cannot be separated from the moral
order, the demands of truth, a concern for the common good or the
well-being of other people.
   "Such a separation would result not in freedom, but in license."
   Mahony said he wrote the letter because Los Angeles is the
entertainment capital of the world, an area where "a great proportion
of the world's entertainment is conceived, financed and produced."
   "But I also write for our Catholic community and for all people of
goodwill across the nation who are viewers of these efforts," he said.
   The letter comes in the midst of an intense campaign year debate
over "family values," a term Mahony avoided, using "human" instead,
and an on-going attack on Hollywood by Vice President Dan Quayle and
leaders of the Religious Right.
   Mahony, however, has rejected the more extreme of those views.
Earlier this year, he quickly disavowed a statement from the
archdiocesan office, which said that he would call for a tough new
film rating code. It was being proposed by the Atlanta-based Christian
Film and Television Commission.
   In preparing the letter, Mahony met with several leaders of the
industry. They included Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA Inc., parent of
Universal Pictures, as well as the heads of the Writers Guild of
America West and the Directors Guild of America.
   In the letter Mahony posed a series of guidelines filmmakers and
other entertainers should apply to themselves, including avoiding
sexist portrayals of women. He noted especially that the responsible
filmmaker's task is made difficult by the fact that so much of the
audience is made up of "young people who are not yet emotionally
mature."
   "Given the power of film, what might be a tasteful and realistic
portrayal of a significant human experience for a disciplined and
mature adult, can result, for sensitive and vulnerable young people,
in self-destructive, anti-social behavior," he said.
   "The Golden Rule applies here," he added. "Responsible filmmakers
will not do to their audience what they would not done to themselves
or to their own teen-age sons and daughters," he said.
   The letter was greeted by industry officials with relief and
praise.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, called the Mahony letter "wise and thoughtful." Danny
Goldberg, president of Atlantic Records and chairman of the American
Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California, told the Los
Angeles Times he was "impressed" and "moved" by the letter.
   "It speaks to the kind of relationship that artists should have
with religion," he said.
   On religion, Mahony noted that the "overhelming majority of
American people believe in God and pray regularly. They look to God to
give meaning to their lives."
   The responsible filmmaker, he said, should ask, "Is the religious
dimension of the characters in their story in evidence. If not, why
not?"
   He also challenged filmmakers to upgrade their portrayal of women.
"Are they persons possessing the same intrinsic dignity as their male
counterparts and, at the deepest level, facing the same soul-wrenching
challenges to grow? ... Or is the impression given that they are
somehow something less, valued as objects rather than the persons they
are."
   In urging that "human values" be reflected, Mahony said such values
"are not the exclusive property of any one religious community, ethnic
group, educational level, economic class or political party."
   "To the filmmakers of our community, I say: Make films which
reflect these kinds of values and you actualize what is deepest,
richest and most creative within you. By doing so, you will give
something very special to your audiences. I can think of no better way
for you to say `thank you' for the superlative talents you have been
given by God."

Pastor resigns prominent Baptist pulpit
RNS>17235

By Jim Jones
Speical to Religious News Service
   DALLAS (RNS) -- A minister hired to be pastor of one of the largest
congregations in the Southern Baptist Convention resigned abruptly
Wednesday night, claiming the legendary senior pastor, the Rev. W.A.
Criswell, was reluctant to give up leadership.
   The Rev. Joel Gregory, named to succeed Criswell in November 1990
at 28,000-member First Baptist Church here, stunned members attending
a Wednesday prayer service when he read a resignation statement. In
the statement he charged that some church leaders were trying to
prolong Criswell's ministry at Gregory's expense.
   "The ultimate agenda," he said, "is in the prolongation of the
incumbent's ministry rather than enabling the new pastor's."
   Gregory, 44, said he considered his resignation to be irrevocable
and effective immediately.
   Gregory acknowledged that a short "transition period" had been
agreed upon when he accepted the prestigious post. At the time he was
hired, the arrangement was for Criswell to continue preaching at the
church's 11 a.m. Sunday service, while Gregory would preach at the
church's other three weekly services. Criswell, 82, was just the
second pastor of the church, founded in 1898.
   However, in the interview Gregory said he had recently learned that
some congregational leaders were expressing hopes that Criswell, a
former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, would remain as
senior pastor until his 50th anniversary at the church, still two
years away.
   "There was a verbal agreement that this was a short-term
transition," said Gregory. "I didn't anticipate it to be 20 months. I
certainly didn't anticipate it to be four years."
   Gregory, 44, said he had been told originally that Criswell would
step down as senior pastor after only a few months, possibly by the
spring of 1991.
   Gregory, a noted preacher in the 15-million-member denomination,
said, "The decision had elements of pain, but it also had elements of
integrity and rightness. I feel a verbal understanding among
Christians ought to be honored."
   Before accepting the pastorate, Gregory noted, he had been warned
by many fellow pastors that it would be impossible to be the true
pastor of First Baptist as long as Criswell remained in the pulpit.
   "I was told by many people, and, you know, they were right," said
Gregory.
   Asked about his plans, Gregory said, "I plan to rest and read. That
congregation is a huge burden, a day and night responsibility. I'll
rest awhile and see what opens up."
   Gregory said he had approached some congregational leaders about
the problem in recent weeks and was told he should bring his concerns
directly to Criswell.
   But in his statement he said he had decided that option would not
be appropriate.
   Despite the situation, Gregory said, he bears no animosity toward
Criswell, who was on the platform with Gregory when he made his
announcement.
   Criswell made no statement at the Wednesday service, and a
spokesman at First Baptist said Thursday afternoon that Criswell was
unavailable for comment on the matter.

   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)

   The Rev. Morris Chapman, president of the executive committee of
the Southern Baptist Convention, said he was aware of the struggles
within the Dallas church but had no idea they would result in a
resignation.
   "Things were not going real easily in the church," Chapman said
from executive committee headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. "It was just
a time of transition which was not going smoothly."
   "Dr. Criswell has given great leadership to the church over the
years," said Chapman. "Dr. Gregory is one of the premier preachers in
the Southern Baptist Convention."
   Up until 1990, Gregory had not been publicly identified with either
the denomination's moderate factions or its fundamentalists, who over
the past decade have come to dominate most of the denomination's
boards and commissions.
   But that year, when it seemed a moderate could be elected president
of the denomination, Gregory joined with several other prominent
pastors to endorse Chapman, the more conservative candidate.
   At that time, he said he hoped to "demonstrate that the
conservative resurgence in the convention is not simply a punitive
political plot to transfer power to one group" and said he hoped "to
be able to call all our people together who affirm the Bible as the
perfect work of God."

NEWS ON THE TAX FRONT

     Legislative update.  At this time Congress and the President
are still at loggerheads.  The jam could be broken at any time,
or could outlast the spring thaw.  It does appear that much of
the reform bill is vulnerable to change.
     Most prizes and awards are taxable income.  In Yarbrough
Oldsmobile Cadillac, Inc. (T.C. Memo. 1995-538) the Court held
trips received by the taxpayer from an auto manufacturer were
taxable income to the company president.  In addition, the Court
found that two boats were the property of the president and
shareholder, even though the corporation held title to the boats.
The president was the only person to use the boats.
     In an audit of regular corporations, agents often claim an
officer-shareholder's compensation is unreasonable.  Any amount
disallowed is treated as a nondeductible dividend.  In  Guy
Schoenecker, Inc., (T.C. Memo. 1995-539) the Court sided with the
IRS in finding the president's salary to be excessive.  The Court
noted that the president set his compensation based on what he
wanted to take out of the company, and not what would have been
paid in an arm's-length transaction.  The fact that the president
decreased the bonus of one employee while increasing his own
weighed against him.
     In Announcement 95-98 (I.R.B. 1995-47, 19) the IRS announced
that the expiration date on the 1992 revision of Form 3115,
Application for Change in Accounting Method has been extended to
August 31, 1998.
     The strong bond market is benefiting taxpayers who owe
interest on underpayment penalties.  In Internal Revenue News
Release IR-95-96 the Service announced that the interest rates
for the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1996 will remain at
8% for overpayments, 9% for underpayments, and 11% for large
corporate underpayments.
     In Announcement 95-99 (I.R.B. 1995-48) the IRS released
examination guidelines for employee plan examiners to use when
examining plans for compliance with certain distribution
requirements and for the application of the limitation on
benefits.
     When incorporating a new business you can avoid a taxable
transaction by contributing assets to the corporation in exchange
for stock (Sec. 351).  However, the corporation's basis in the
assets acquired are generally equal to the transferor's basis.
In George Georgiou and Judith Georgiou, (T.C. Memo. 1995-546) the
Court held that inventories the taxpayer transferred to a new
corporation had to be valued at the taxpayer's basis.  He could
not value the assets at their fair market value.
     You can only deduct living expenses while away from home if
the job assignment is temporary.  Generally, that means less than
a year.  In Gary M. and Trudy J. Weichlein (T.C. Memo. 1995-553)
the taxpayer had no prospect of finding work near her home and
worked at a series of jobs away from home, all for the same
employer.  The Court denied her traveling expenses.
     There are a number of similarities between partnerships and
S corporations in the way they are taxed.  But there are a number
of differences.  A shareholder's income from an S corporation can
consist of salary and the passthrough of income, but none of the
income qualifies as self-employment income.  That's what the
Court held in Antonio R. Durando (95-2 USTC 50,615).  Since the
taxpayer had no self-employment income, he could not make
contributions to a Keogh plan.
     Rev. Proc. 95-51 (I.R.B. 1995-51) provides approval to
change the funding method used to determine the minimum funding
standard for defined benefit plans under Code Sec. 412.
     In Internal Revenue News Release IR-95-68 the IRS announced
that most taxpayers will be able to have their IRS refunds
deposited directly to their checking or savings accounts when
filing their 1995 returns.  You must include the necessary bank
information on Form 8888 (Direct Deposit of Refund) and attach
the form to your return.
     Because pending legislation would affect Forms W-4, W-4P and
W-4S, in Announcement 95-104 (I.R.B. 1995-51), the IRS is asking
taxpayers to continue using 1995 forms until the 1996 revisions
are available.  However, Form W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance
Payment Certificate) is being revised and the new form must be
used beginning in 1996.  Some filers of this form may no longer
be eligible for the credit.
     Direct sellers are not considered employees for withholding
tax purposes. In Letter Ruling 9530001 the Service held that
persons who worked as canvassers and closers who went door to
door selling home improvement and repair services were direct
sellers and not employees.  The workers were held to be in the
trade or business of selling consumer products in the home or
other than in a permanent retail establishment.  Substantially
all of the workers' remuneration was related to sales or other
output rather than the number of hours worked.  In addition, the
workers perform their services pursuant to a written agreement
that provides that the workers will not be treated as employees
for federal tax purposes.
     Many small business owners operate more than one business,
sometimes through separate entities.  In Letter Ruling 9530005
the taxpayer performed work for his S corporation and had
consulting income he reported on Schedule C.  The IRS held that
the taxpayer was a corporate officer who performed significant
services which were held to be wages subject to FICA and FUTA
taxes and income tax withholding.  Moreover, he could not net the
losses from S corporations with income from self-employment for
purposes of calculating the self-employment (SECA) tax.

BUSINESS TAXES--INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS

     You own two corporations.  Madison's bank account is
overflowing; Wilton Inc. can't afford to meet this week's
payroll.  Should you just tell your controller to cut the payroll
checks on Madison's bank account?  It depends on all the facts.
However, in some cases it could be very costly move.
     The general rule is that a deduction is only allowed to the
party who both incurs (or is liable for) the expense and makes
the payment.  Let's look at the case of a parent and subsidiary.
Assume you own 100% of Madison Inc.  Madison has a wholly owned
subsidiary, Wilton Inc.  Because Wilton is short of cash, Madison
writes the bonus checks to Wilton's employees on its account.
According to Rev. Rul. 84-68 (1984-1 C.B. 31), Madison can't
deduct the payment.  Instead, Madison records the payment as a
capital contribution to Wilton.  Wilton takes the deduction.
     Generally, the only disadvantage here is some extra
bookkeeping.  Wilton is a subsidiary of Madison, so there's
really no winner or loser from a tax standpoint.
     Now consider a slightly different situation.  Instead of a
parent-subsidiary relationship, you own 100% of both Madison and
Wilton.  Again Madison writes checks for a total of $50,000 to
pay Wilton's employees.  The IRS recharacterizes this as three
separate transactions.  One, Madison paid a $50,000 dividend to
you.  Two, you made a $50,000 capital contribution to Wilton.
Three, Wilton paid a $50,000 bonus.
     The tax effects here are very different.  The dividend is
not deductible by Madison, but is taxable to you.  The capital
contribution has no direct tax effect.  The $50,000 payment is
deductible by Wilton.  Here, again, Wilton gets a $50,000
deduction, but this time you have $50,000 of dividend income.
Keep in mind that there are some subtle tax effects.  For
example, the capital contribution would increase your tax basis
in Wilton should you sell the business.
     Things can get worse in the second example.  What if Wilton
later repaid Madison?  The IRS could recharacterize it as a
$50,000 dividend from Wilton to you followed by a capital
contribution by you to Madison.  The roundtrip of $50,000 has
created $100,000 in income to you.
     What if Madison loaned Wilton the $50,000?  If you can
create a bona fide loan, that should work.  But remember, you
should have a note with a maturity date, collateral, etc.  While
a much better approach, it may not be a sure thing.  The loan
might be recharacterized if Wilton is thinly capitalized or would
not have been able to borrow money from a regular lender.
     What about S corporations?  If both Madison and Wilton are S
corporations, the result may not be as disastrous.  The
distribution from Madison might not be taxable.  Even so, using
the loan approach makes more sense.
     A loan from a regular corporation to an S corporation could
also have adverse consequences.  For example, you own 100% of
Wilton (a regular corporation) and 100% of Madison (an S
corporation).  Wilton loans money to Madison.  The IRS might try
to recharacterize this as an equity contribution by Wilton to
Madison.  You'd get no benefit for the additional capital.
Worse, the S election could be terminated.
     You should also be careful of other transactions.  For
example, Madison produces widgets which it sells to unrelated
customers for $10 each.  Madison also sells them to Wilton, but
for cost, $4 each.  Madison and Wilton are both owned by you.
the IRS might try to recharacterize this transaction.  You could
also have problems if Madison sold the widgets to Wilton for more
than it charges regular customers.  (See Product Discounts,
below.)
     Another point.  In the examples we assumed you own 100% of
both corporations.  That's not necessary.  For example, you could
encounter problems if you and 4 other associates own all the
stock of both entities.
     If you do business through two or more regular corporations,
and there are regular intercompany transactions, talk to your tax
adviser about setting up a parent-subsidiary relationship.  And
keep all dealings on an arms'-length basis.

BUSINESS TAXES--TELEMARKETER-EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?

     In religion the eternal struggle is good vs. evil.  In the
annals of the IRS it's employee vs. independent contractor.  The
IRS and the courts look at 20 factors when making a
determination.  Some factors may not be appropriate.  However,
one factor present in almost all cases is the degree of control
by the employer.
     Telemarketers were the subject of a recent letter ruling (LR
9527009), but the IRS advice was unchanged from an earlier
revenue ruling (Rev. Rul. 74-333, 1974-2 C.B. 328), so it can
generally be relied upon.
     In the first situation, a company engaged an individual to
perform services as a telephone solicitor to obtain orders.  Her
duties are to telephone certain prospects designated by the
company and to record the necessary information on an order blank
at the time a sale is made.  She is furnished with office
facilities, supplies and a telephone by the company on its
premises.  There is no prescribed period of training; however the
company does furnish a suggested script.  The calls are made at
times optional to the solicitor, but she is expected to devote
from 4 to 8 hours daily to the job.  Her services are performed
under the company's name.  She is paid a commission on each sale
and is not expected to produce a minimum volume of sales.  Her
services may be terminated at any time.
     In this situation, the IRS held the worker was an employee
since the company exercises or has the right to exercise
direction and control over the worker.
     In the second situation, the facts are the same as above,
but the worker operates out of her own home, performs all
services on a part-time basis, without supervision, and pays all
the expenses incurred in connection with her selling activities.
The worker is given a list of names from a telephone directory so
that there is no duplication.  She does not submit reports, other
than sales orders, does not deliver the products or collect
payments, and is not required to devote any certain amount of
time to the work, perform any services on the company's premises,
or produce a minimum volume of sales.
     In this situation the IRS held that the company does not or
can not exercise enough control to call the worker an employee.
Thus, the worker would be classified as an independent
contractor.
     Rev. Rul. 75-242 (1975-1 C.B. 321) presented a slightly
different situation.  The telemarketers worked from home,
furnishing their own phones, under the company's name.  The
company provided the workers with all necessary forms and
stationery.  They were given introductory training and furnished
with a required speech.  The solicitors were required to complete
a daily report listing all calls made and the number of hours
spent performing services.  The company also specified the hours
during the day and the number of days a week that each solicitor
was to perform the services.  The company paid the workers on an
hourly basis.
     Here the IRS held that the worker was an employee because of
the control involved (hours of work required, reports, etc.),
even though the solicitor worked out of his house.
     The letter ruling had a slightly different set of facts.
Workers who performed the services at offices provided by the
company and had to work a certain number of hours were deemed
employees.  Those who either had to or choose to work at home
with no restrictions, were considered independent contractors.
It didn't make any difference that the workers signed a contract
indicating they were independent contractors.
     There's no general answer.  Each situation is different.
There is one way to avoid problems.  Try to modify your business
practices to follow the situation described in the revenue
ruling.  For example, have the person work out of their house (or
own office), make them pay for their own supplies, pay them
solely on commission, etc.

TAXES--DEPRECIATION-ALLOWED OR ALLOWABLE

     When you sell any tangible personal property (e.g.,
machinery, furniture, etc.) used in your business, you may have a
gain or a loss.  The nature (ordinary income or capital gain) and
the amount of the gain or loss will depend on the depreciation
'allowed or allowable'.  Allowed or allowable is a technical
term, but it can be a big trap if you're not careful.
     Basically, allowed or allowable means that you've got to
reduce your basis in the asset by either the amount of
depreciation you took, or the amount you should have taken.
There's the trap.  If you inadvertently don't take depreciation
on an asset, the law assumes you depreciated the asset using the
straight line method, and your basis in the asset will be reduced
accordingly.
     Example--In 1988 Madison Inc. purchased a new machine for
$10,000, but through a bookkeeping error, never took any
depreciation.  In 1996 Madison sells the machine for $4,500.
Since the machine would have been fully depreciated using the
straight line method, Madison's basis is $0 and it will have to
report a gain of $4,500 on the sale.
     The $4,500 gain would be the same if Madison had taken
depreciation, but it would have gotten $10,000 in tax deductions
over the years.
     There's only one possible out.  If you discover the error
before it's too late you might be able to file an amended return
and recover some lost depreciation deductions.  More than likely
you'll only be able to salvage a fraction of what you could have
taken.
     Be sure to record and depreciate all fixed asset additions.
While not as popular as general accounting software, there a
number of programs that make it relatively painless.

BUSINESS TAXES--PRODUCT DISCOUNTS

     Rebates or discounts on products sold to customers or
dealers are always deductible, right?  Don't answer too quickly.
While you'll have no trouble if you've got a standard formula
(e.g., 10% off on purchases over $500, etc.), you could run into
an IRS challenge if you get too tricky.
     In one recent case (Foretravel, Inc.,;1 T.C. Memo. 1995-494)
the taxpayer was a manufacturer of high-end motor coaches.  The
taxpayer sold the motor homes through both independent and
captive (subsidiary) dealerships.  The units had high wholesale
and suggested retail prices (to maintain a top-of-the-line
image), but substantial discounts might have to be made by the
dealer to sell a demo unit, one with an unusual paint scheme,
etc.  Adjustments would also have to be made if a customer was
trading in an used coach made by the taxpayer.  On the other
hand, if the dealer could sell a coach at the full price, it
certainly tried to do so.
     The taxpayer had no written policy for arriving at a
discount.  The company took into account trade-ins, customer
goodwill, the type of customer (a high profile owner such as a
leader of a motor home club might get a bigger discount), etc.
In fact, because the ultimate profit on the sale might not be
known until after the trade-in unit was sold, the rebates were
generally not determined until the end of the year.
     The taxpayer recorded the rebates by crediting accounts
receivable and debiting bad debts.  When preparing the financial
statements, the company's accountants reclassified the rebates.
Unfortunately, because of several oversights, the
reclassification was not reflected on the tax returns.
     The IRS contended that the incentive payments were
contributions to the capital of the dealerships and thus not
deductible.  That argument was based on the fact that the rebates
were not based on the dealership's performance.
     Fortunately, the Court sided with the taxpayer.  The Court
found that the mistaken accounting entries were not fatal.  The
Court looked behind the bookkeeping entries to determine the true
nature of the payments.  It also found that a strict formula was
not necessary for the payments to qualify as discounts.  The
Court noted that the product was unique, there were valid
business reasons for the incentives, and that the company had to
customize the rebates to fit the situations.
     CAUTION.  While the taxpayer won, not having a numerical
formula could cause problems in more normal instances.  Consider
a regular policy first; handling it the way the taxpayer did here
should be your fallback position.
     Getting tricky can get you into trouble.  In another case
(Sun Microsystems, Inc., T.C. Memo. 1993-467) the taxpayer tied
purchase price discounts to the purchase by that customer of
warrants to buy the taxpayer's stock.  Again, the taxpayer won
the case, but not without a fight.

FRINGE BENEFITS--MEAL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES

     On several occasions we've mentioned that not all meal and
entertainment expenses are subject to the 50% rule (i.e., only
50% of the expense can be deducted).  Here's some more
information on one frequently encountered situation.
     Expenses for recreational, social, or similar activity,
primarily for the benefit of employees, is not subject to the 50%
rule.  The exception only applies to expenditures made primarily
for the benefit of employees other than those who are officers,
shareholders or other owners of a 10% or greater interest, or
other highly compensated employees.  Family members of employees
are treated as employees here.
     What sort of activities fall under this exception?
Christmas parties, annual picnics, summer outings, or maintaining
a swimming pool, baseball diamond, bowling alley, etc. are given
in the regulations as examples.  You could probably extend that
to occasional office parties.  If the parties are regular, they
probably won't qualify.  For example, the company signs a big
contract on Thursday.  Friday evening, most of the office goes
out for drinks and dinner, for which the company pays.  That
should qualify.  On the other hand, drinks on the company every
Friday won't.
     If, because of the number of employees, you have to limit
the number of participants, that's all right.  You just can't
discriminate in favor of officers, owners, etc.  That means, you
could fail to fall under the exception if the only people at the
outing are officers, or if family members of owners are invited
by not family members of other employees.

S CORPORATIONS--LOSS PASSTHROUGHS AND BASIS

     Losses generated by S corporations and partnerships are
passed through to the shareholders or partners.  However, the
losses can only be used to reduce your taxable income up to your
basis in the S corporation or partnership.  Losses in excess of
basis can be carried forward and used in a later year.  Your
basis is generally equal to your equity plus any loans you made
to the S corporation.  The same rules apply to partnerships, but
your basis can also include any partnership loans for which
you're liable.
     Example--For 1995 Madison Inc. has a $50,000 loss.  You're
the only shareholder and your basis (at the end of the year, but
before the loss) is $35,000.  You can only deduct $35,000 of the
loss in 1995.  The remaining $15,000 can be carried forward and
deducted in 1996 (or a later year), if you have sufficient basis.
     What are your options?  Tax professionals often
automatically advise loaning enough money to the corporation to
increase your basis so that you can take the entire loss.
     Instead of going with a rule of thumb, work through the
numbers.  Can you use the additional loss in the current year?
Even if you can, does it make sense?  For example, assume you're
normally in the 36% tax bracket, but this year you're in the 15%
bracket.  Any additional loss will only save taxes at 15%.  If
the loss was carried forward, you might be able to offset income
in the 36% bracket.
     If the loss for a year is large enough it could offset all
your income and create a net operating loss (yes, individuals can
have a NOL).  In that case the loss can be carried back three
years.  If you were in a high bracket in that year you might want
to make a capital contribution or loan this year to use the
entire loss.

TAXES--PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES

     More and more companies are challenging their personal
property tax assessments.  If your company has a substantial
amount invested in fixed assets or inventory, arguing your
assessment can save considerable tax dollars.  Property tax laws
vary from state to state, so there are no general rules.  But
here are some points to consider.
     o Make sure the assets are there.  You may be carrying
assets on the books that have been sold or scrapped or moved to
another state.  Consider doing a physical inventory to confirm
the accounting records.
     o If the assessment is based on the book value of the
assets, make sure you're depreciating the assets correctly.
     o Check the law carefully.  The rules vary by state and even
by county and town in many cases.  Some assets may be exempt,
others taxed at a lower rate.  Inventory is exempt in about half
the states.
     o You may be able to challenge the formula.  In a recent
Virginia case the taxpayer fought the county's approach that
valued computer equipment at a rate that declined to no less than
20% of the purchase price after 5 years.  The judge found the
equipment worth no more than 4%  of its cost after 5 years and 1%
in subsequent years.
     o Make sure the property is classified correctly.  There are
a number of areas where the definition of personal and real
property cross.  A single purpose building such as a greenhouse
may be considered personal property in some states; real property
in others.  Items in a building, such as overhead cranes, are
also subject to misclassification.
     o You may be taxed on idle equipment that you haven't used
in years.  Consider abandoning or scraping it.

MANAGEMENT--LICENSING YOUR IDEAS

     You may come up with a idea for a new product, process, etc.
that has potential but that you can't explore because of limited
capital, time, expertise or experience in a particular market.
One way to generate revenue with little or no expense is to
license the product to another firm.  Many products are
manufactured under license.  Unfortunately, you've got to take
steps to protect your idea and maximize the revenue.  Here are
some thoughts.
     o The license agreement is critical.  Get an attorney who's
a specialist in this area.  It may cost you several thousand
dollars more, but it will pay big returns in the long run.
     o The contract should take into account changes in
technology.  That may mean it should be for a limited time.  Or
provide for changes in some way.  Technology is changing more
rapidly than ever.  Many years ago, when personal computers were
in their infancy, a large newspaper gave exclusive rights for on
line access to its paper without any expiration on the agreement.
At that time the agreement was probably worth very little; today
the agreement is a gold mine.  Changing technology can also have
an effect on the medium.  Selling the reproduction rights to a
book today may involve a print edition, movie version,
television, video tape, CD-ROM, and on-line access.  Failure to
cover all possibilities could be costly.
     o Definitions and limitations are important.  Does the
licensee include different versions?  Can the product be sold in
just foreign markets?  Just the U.S.?
     o Make sure the licensee will promote the product.  Chances
are you may be selling the product to a company with a rival
product.  They may buy your idea just to keep it off the market.
Or they may market your product on a token basis.  Or they may
decide not to promote your product until they can leapfrog your
technology.  If all your income is based on royalties, your
return may be minimal.
     o Include the right to cancel the contract after a certain
period of time if the royalties don't reach a certain level.  For
example, if royalties don't reach $20,000 by the end of the one
year after the agreement is signed.  You can include a second and
third level.  For example, royalties must reach $35,000
annualized by the end of the second year.
     o The royalty payment will probably be based on sales of the
product.  The contract should contain a minimum payment amount.
For example, the greater of 2% of sales or $10,000 per year.
That will give the licensee some incentive to push the product.
     o Give the licensee some incentive to increase sales by
providing for progressively lower royalty rates.  For example,
royalties are 5% of the first $500,000 of sales; 4% on the next
$1 million of sales; 3% on sales over $1.5 million.
     o Be sure you have the right to audit the licensee's books.
More than one licensee has understated sales to reduce royalty
payments.
     o If the company produces a competing product you should be
especially careful.  The contract should contain a clause
prohibiting the company from developing or selling a competitive
product during the term of the agreement and possibly for a
certain period after termination.
     o Limit the right to assign the contract.  You may license a
small software producer with revenue of $5 million a year to sell
your product and feel comfortable in dealing with the owners.
What happens if Megasoft Inc. acquires that company?  Will you
still feel comfortable with the license agreement?
     o Be especially careful if the product or idea contains some
proprietary technology.  For example, you may be licensing a new
electronic device for the medical market because you have no
experience in that market.  However, the device contains
proprietary technology that you use in products you sell to the
consumer and military markets.  You want to protect that
technology.
    Licensing can produce significant returns for only a minor
investment.  However, you need to consider all the possibilities
and get good advice before signing a deal.  The investment in
time and money will pay off.  Consider too, that negotiations
here are likely to be tricky.  It's not like selling a business
or division.  You still want control of the product.
     Finally, if the product is not amenable to licensing,
consider selling the rights outright, either in total or in a
particular market.  Many of the suggestions above will still
apply (e.g., limit the ability to assign the agreement, be
careful if the buyer is a competitor, etc.).  If you do so, make
sure you have recourse should the buyer default on any deferred
payments.

PERSONAL FINANCE--CHOOSING AN ADVISOR

     Looking for a personal financial planner?  There's a wide
range of choices.  Everyone's familiar with stockbrokers, but
what does the designation ChFC stand for?  Here are your basic
options.
     Certified Financial Planner  The designation is granted by
the International Board of Standards and Practices for Certified
Financial Planners.  To qualify for the CFP license the candidate
must have at least a bachelor's degree, complete an approved
financial planning program and have at least 3 years experience
in financial planning (varies with education).  The candidate
must pass a comprehensive 2-day, 10-hour exam.  After
certification the individual must complete 30 hours of continuing
professional education every 2 years.
     Chartered Financial Consultant  The designation (ChFC) is
awarded by the American College in Bryn Mawr, PA, which also
grants the CLU (Chartered Life Underwriter) designation.  The
candidate must have at least 3 years of business experience (less
with an undergraduate or graduate degree).  He or she must also
take 10 courses through American College and then pass 10 2-hour
exams.  A ChFC must complete 60 hours of continuing professional
education every 2 years.
     Personal Financial Specialist This is a specialty
designation awarded to CPAs.  The designation is granted by the
AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants).  The
first step in qualifying is to hold a current CPA certificate and
be an AICPA member.  The education requirements are the same as
those for a regular CPA certificate and vary by state.  However,
every CPA must pass a comprehensive exam that is the same from
state to state.  In order to receive the Personal Financial
Specialist (PFS) designation, the CPA must have at least 250
hours of financial planning experience each year for the
preceding 3 years and pass a comprehensive 6-hour exam.  A PFS
must complete at least 72 hours of continuing education in
personal financial planning every 3 years (in addition to 750
hours of experience every 3 years).
     Chartered Financial Analyst A CFA is more likely to be a
securities analyst or investment adviser than a personal
financial planner.  He must have a bachelor's degree or an
equivalent amount of work experience and pass three comprehensive
tests, each of which is 6 hours long.  He must have 3 years of
experience as a financial analyst.
     The tests for the first three designations focus on
financial planning fundamentals, income taxation, insurance,
investments, estate and retirement planning, etc.  The CFA
designation focuses on financial accounting, quantitative
analysis, securities analysis, etc.
     Broker or Registered Representative  The person must have a
background in the securities business and pass a series of tests,
including the General Securities Examination and state securities
tests.  He is "registered" with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  He generally works for a brokerage house.
     Other Choices There are many other individuals who will
provide financial advice, but whose qualifications are unlikely
to match those mentioned above.
     Pros and Cons For overall financial planning (estate
planning, insurance, tax planning, etc.) the first three choices,
certified financial planner, chartered financial consultant and
personal financial specialist are about equally ranked.  A
personal financial specialist might have the edge if the CPA firm
you're dealing with has one or you need the broad base of
knowledge that a CPA has.  For example, a CPA with a PFS
designation might be better able to help you with both business
and personal financial planning.  You should be wary of brokers
and other planners since their background is not as general and
they are likely to steer you into investments that they sell.  A
chartered financial analyst would be a good choice for help in
picking particular securities or industries to invest in, but may
not be a good choice for overall planning.
     A final word.  Even accredited professionals should be
checked out.  Ask about their experience.  It is not
inappropriate to get references or ask business associates, your
banker, etc. about them.  And you've got to feel comfortable with
the planner.  Personal feelings are sure to creep in to the
planner's opinions.  For example, a 60-year old adviser is likely
to be more risk adverse than one 30 years old.

THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNet
January 1, 1996

IN BRIEF:

     Director's liability . . . Officers and directors of
corporations owe a fiduciary responsibility to the corporation
they represent.  Clearly, that means they can be held liable if
they act in bad faith or with gross negligence.  And it goes
without saying that an officer or director has to put the
interests of the corporation ahead of his personal interests if
his interests conflict with those of the corporation.  However, a
board member who does nothing may be at risk.  Board members have
been sued for inattention to the matters of the corporation.
     Leasing . . . Leasing, instead of buying and financing the
purchase, may make sense for a lot of reasons, but keeping your
balance sheet clean probably isn't one of them.  In most cases a
lease obligation has to be disclosed.  In the case of a finance
lease (basically, where you own the equipment at the end of the
term for little or no extra outlay), the capitalized value is an
asset; the payments are a liability.  Even if you don't have
regular financial statements, most creditors will ask you about
lease obligations.
     Bonuses . . . Want to reward an executive or employee?
Giving a bonus rather than a big raise can make sense.  Three
reasons.  First, giving a raise may affect other payments such as
vacation and sick pay.  Second, should the employee not perform
as well next year, or if you're strapped for cash, you won't be
locked into a higher salary.  Third, it's usually much easier to
keep a bonus quiet than a raise.  That means you can give it
selectively without creating office talk.
     Speed is everything . . . You're buying a new computer.
What should you look for?  The MHz (megahertz) rating is
important, but if you're looking for pure speed, that's not the
only factor.  Final results will depend on a number of factors.
For example, if you're running software that's heavily dependent
on RAM (random access memory) you could find that a 90MHz Pentium
machine with 16M bytes (megabytes) of RAM is significantly faster
than a 133MHz unit with 8M bytes of RAM.  If your budget is
tight, you might want to go with the slower machine and use the
savings to put in more RAM.  Likewise, if you do a lot of
graphics work, a graphics accelerator card with extra memory will
pay for itself.
     Merger mania . . . If you've got a significant portfolio of
stocks, sooner or later one of them might be a merger target.  If
the deal's all cash, you've got no choice.  However, in many
deals you have an option.  You can elect to take the cash or take
the stock in the acquiring or combined entity.  What's the best
approach?  If you take the cash, you'll have an immediate gain or
loss.  If you take the stock, your gain or loss will be deferred
until you sell the new stock.  Deferring the gain can make sense
in many cases, particularly if you've already realized
substantial gains during the year.  Talk to your tax and
investment advisors.  If you're going to take the stock and plan
to hold it for a while, be sure the prospects for the acquiring
company are sound.
     Tax exempt munis from Puerto Rico . . . The general rule is
that obligations issued by a state or municipality is exempt from
federal income tax and from tax in the state of issuance.  For
example, if you're a Massachusetts resident, interest on bonds
issued by Massachusetts (or a municipality in the state) would
not be taxable.  If you're a New York resident, the income would
be taxable.  There's an exception.  Interest on bonds issued by
Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are exempt in all states.
Thus, interest on a bond issued by the Virgin Islands would be
exempt to both a New York and a Massachusetts resident.  These
bonds can be particularly useful to taxpayers who are transferred
frequently.
     Slow payers . . . Your terms are net 30 but Madison Inc.
always pays you 60 days after billing.  They're an important,
long-time customer and the check always arrives on the 60th day
so you live with it.  That may be all you can do.  However, you
should still monitor the payments.  If the 60 days begins to
stretch to 65 or 70 days, there may be a real problem.  Even if
the company is still financially sound, they may be testing you.
Now's the time to step in and make sure they don't stretch
payments any farther.  In fact, it may be the perfect opportunity
to ask them to speed up payments.
     Is the property insurable? . . . That may be the first
question you should ask before purchasing a new home (or business
property).  Many insurers, hit by huge claims, are avoiding
certain areas or properties entirely.  For example, several
companies will write no policies on homes within 1,000 of the
coastline.  You may still be able to get insurance, but only for
a big premium.  An extra 10 feet back may save you over $1,000
per year.  You should also keep insurability in mind if you're
buying a new car, investing in a business, etc.

               SUMMARIES OF TODAY'S IMPORTANT TAX NEWS.

             TAX ANALYSTS ANNOUNCES NEW CITATION SYSTEMS.

     Starting January 1, 1996, Tax Analysts adopted a new citation
system to identify full text documents. A single, uniform number now
identifies each new document that we add to our print, electronic,
microfiche, fax, and CD-ROM publications. You can use that number to
obtain documents in whatever publishing medium you find most
convenient.

     No matter where a document appears or how you choose to order
it, the identifying number is now the same.

     The new citation format consists of the abbreviation "Doc"
followed by the last two digits of the current year, plus a serial
number. For example, the 141st document received by Tax Analysts in
1996 is identified in this way:

                             Doc 96-141

     Pre-1996 documents will continue to be identified by means of
our earlier citation systems. In other words, citations already
assigned to documents will not change.

     We believe that our customers will find our new citation system
to be substantially simpler and more convenient than the multiple
systems that we have used in the past.

Pinpoint Citations

     Along with the unified full text citation system, Tax Analysts
now provides pinpoint citations by means of bracketed paragraph
numbers in full text documents appearing in our print and electronic
publications. The new system enables you to specify the precise
portions of a full text document to which you wish to make reference.

     The new pinpoint citation system is available in substantially
all full text documents produced by Tax Analysts in print and
electronic form, including court decisions, IRS announcements and
rulings, congressional reports, and the like.

     The new paragraph numbering system does not apply to documents
that already have their own numbering system, such as statutes and
IRS regulations.

     The new paragraph numbering system is based on precedents
developed in British Columbia and recently adopted by the Supreme
Court of Canada. Paragraph numbering has been discussed extensively
in the United States as a means of providing pinpoint citations in
electronic texts, but it appears that Tax Analysts's adoption of
paragraph numbering is the first broadscale use of paragraphing to
provide pinpoint text citations.

     To cite to a specific paragraph in a Tax Analysts's document,
simply place a comma after the document citation and then add the
relevant paragraph number. For example:

                           Doc 96-141, 28

     Ranges of paragraphs or a series of individual paragraphs may be
cited as follows:

                          Doc 96-141, 28-33

                                 or

                       Doc 96-141, 28, 37, 54

     Tax Analysts' citation system and its guidelines for paragraph
numbering are not copyrighted. The memorandums discussing these
issues, together with the related computer programs, are available to
interested members of the public, and to other publishers, on
request. They will be made available in January 1996 on the Internet.

     If you have questions about our new full text document citation
system or need assistance, call Customer Service at (800) 955-3444.

           BUDGET NEGOTIATORS SET TO MEET THROUGH WEEKEND.

     Congressional and White House negotiators left the Capitol
December 29 promising to meet through the weekend if necessary to
hammer out a budget deal.

     "I expect us to make further progress," President Clinton told
reporters. "We will begin to deal with some of the difficult issues
today involving how we can balance the budget and protect Medicare,
Medicaid, education and the environment," said Clinton, who did not
mention taxes.

     House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said, "There are reasons to
be cautiously optimistic. I would hope that over the next two or
three days we could basically get this done and have everything up
and running and everyone paid for while the staff work[s] out the
technical details."

                AIRLINE EXCISE TAXES SLATED TO EXPIRE.

     The 10 percent excise tax on airline tickets was scheduled to
expire at midnight December 31 unless Congress and the president
approved legislation to extend it. That was considered an unlikely
prospect, although high-level budget meetings were scheduled to
continue through the weekend.

     Under the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Program, excise taxes
are imposed on domestic passenger tickets, domestic freight waybills,
international departures, and noncommercial aviation fuel.

     The budget reconciliation bill Congress passed in November would
extend these excise taxes through September 30, 1996. Contingent on
this extension, the reconciliation bill also would extend through
next September 30 airlines' exemption from the 4.3-cent-per-gallon
tax on aviation fuel.

    IRS AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES AT LOGGERHEADS ON ACCESS TO RECORDS.

     Writing a history of the IRS from the advent of the modern
income tax (1913) to today would be difficult. The National Archives
does not have much information, and the IRS is not likely to provide
any. Unlike most government agencies, the IRS does not turn many of
its records over to the Archives. This has been its practice since
the 1920s. Since 1976, with the tightening of the confidentiality
rules under Internal Revenue Code section 6103, the IRS has been even
less willing to turn over records to the nation's document preserver.

     Even an employee authorized to use internal records would have
difficulty researching a complete history of the agency -- because
the IRS does not have its own centralized recordkeeping or filing
system.

     Recently, the IRS's first and only historian, Shelly Davis,
resigned in protest over the way the IRS was mishandling its records
and the agency's refusal to send documents to the National Archives
as required by law. (See The Wall Street Journal, Dec. 15, 1995, p.
A1.)

     And late last year, the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) issued a report evaluating the IRS's records
management. NARA found that the IRS is neglecting federal laws
regarding record retention.

     IRS RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PANNED BY NATIONAL ARCHIVES.

     The IRS's records management program has serious shortcomings
that must be fixed if the agency is to be in compliance with federal
law, according to a recent report by the National Archives. The
evaluation of IRS practices found that the agency does not send to
the Archives the kinds of records routinely transferred to it by
other federal agencies -- which is a nice way of saying the IRS is
not doing what the law says it has to do.

     An important concern is the Archives' inability to appraise
documents for archival retention because of disclosure restrictions
claimed by the IRS under Internal Revenue Code section 6103, which
restricts the disclosure of tax return information.

     The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is
authorized to conduct inspections or surveys of the records, records
management programs and practices of federal agencies, and recommend
improvements.

     Authority to save or dispose of a government record must come
from NARA. This is done through records control schedules, which
direct what happens to a record or class of records. The schedules
are prepared by the federal agency, but the final disposition of a
record or class of records must be approved by NARA. An agency cannot
legally take unilateral actions on records dispositions.

YEAR IN REVIEW: FOR THE SERVICE, 'PIVOTAL' YEAR CONTAINS ITS SHARE OF
                              SETBACKS.

     By all accounts, 1995 was a trying year for the Service. In many
high-profile areas -- computer modernization, the budget, electronic
filing, and compliance programs -- IRS setbacks seemed to outnumber
the victories, at least as far as Congress was concerned.

     After years of favorable treatment from congressional
appropriators, the IRS found the new GOP Congress resistant to
administration funding requests. Lawmakers, frustrated by what they
saw as a spending vacuum caused by Tax Systems Modernization (TSM),
became increasingly critical of whether TSM funds were being used
effectively.

     The net budget result: $200 million less in funding than the
agency received in fiscal 1995, and nearly $1 billion less than
requested by President Clinton. Before the IRS budget was signed in
late November, the agency had endured a several-day shutdown and
announced an indefinite suspension of the Taxpayer Compliance
Measurement Program (TCMP). Along with the TCMP, casualties included
the elimination of a couple thousand IRS jobs, forcing officials to
make some tough choices, not all of which were well-received.

                TWO MEN CHARGED IN RENO BOMBING PLOT.

     Two Nevada men were charged last week with attempting to bomb an
IRS building in Reno in December.

     Ellis Hurst, 52, and Joseph Bailie, 40, both of Gardnerville,
Nev., appeared before U.S. Federal Magistrate Phyllis Atkins and were
charged with attempted destruction of a government building and use
of a destructive device in a crime of violence. (For prior coverage,
see Doc 96-435 (2 pages), 95 TNT 253-4, or H&D, Dec. 29, 1995, p.
5141.)

     The men are accused of attempting to set off a bomb December 18
in a parking lot adjacent to the IRS building in Reno. Authorities
found that the fuse of the bomb had been lit, but that the bomb did
not explode.

     Reuters reported last week that the men had a dispute with the
IRS. "Hurst related both he and Bailie had had difficulties with the
Internal Revenue Service in the past," said Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Special Agent Richard Stoltz.

     The BATF said the the material removed from the device was a
mixture of fertilizer and fuel. Authorities said that had it
exploded, it would have injured or killed many people.

     Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron Rachow said the men face a 30-year
mandatory minimum sentence for use of the explosive device. He said
he would seek grand jury indictments.

     IRS senior spokesman Frank Keith said the agency's field offices
all have disaster recovery plans in place in case of a bombing, an
act of God, or some other violent episode.

     The disaster recovery plan was most recently used last spring
when an off-site building at the Martinsburg Computing Center in West
Virginia caught fire in the middle of the night. Because of the
contingency plan, IRS employees were able to get telephone service
restored and computers working by the next morning.

 IRS ISSUES PROPOSED RULES ON DISTRIBUTIONS OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES
                          BY A PARTNERSHIP.

     The Service has issued proposed regulations (PS-2-95) relating
to the treatment of a distribution of marketable securities by a
partnership. The regs reflect the amendment made to section 731(c) by
the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-465) regarding the
treatment of marketable securities as money for purposes of sections
731(a)(1) and 737.

     In general, the term "marketable securities" includes any
financial instruments that are actively traded. Further, section
731(c)(2)(B)(v) provides that an interest in an entity is a
marketable security if substantially all of the entity's assets
consist of marketable securities or money. The proposed regulations
provide that substantially all of the assets of an entity consist of
marketable securities or money only if 90 percent or more of the
entity's assets at the time of the distribution consist of such
assets.

     In addition, the proposed regs provide that an interest in an
entity is a marketable security to the extent that the value of the
interest is attributable to marketable securities or money that
constitute less than 90 percent but 20 percent or more of the
entity's assets. The 20 percent threshold means that an interest in
an entity holding only a small amount of marketable securities won't
be treated as a marketable security.

     The proposed regulations also provide that a marketable security
will continue to be treated as a marketable security even if the
partnership or its partners are restricted by agreement or otherwise
from selling or exchanging the security. According to the Service,
that provision is intended to prevent a partnership from avoiding
section 731(c) by temporarily restricting the transferability of the
distributed security.

     Consistent with section 731(c)(3)(A), the proposed regs contain
three exceptions to section 731(c). First, they provide that if the
marketable security was contributed to the partnership by the
distributee partner, section 731(c) doesn't apply to the distribution
of that security.

     Second, the regs provide that section 731(c) doesn't apply to
the distribution of a marketable security to the extent that the
security was acquired by the partnership in a nonrecognition
transaction in exchange for property other than marketable securities
or cash and (i) the security is actively traded as of the date of
distribution and (ii) the security is distributed by the partnership
within five years of either the date the security was acquired by the
partnership or, if later, the date the security became actively
traded.

     The proposed regulations further provide that section 731(c)
doesn't apply to the distribution of a marketable security if (i) the
security wasn't actively traded on the date acquired by the
partnership and the entity to which the security relates has no
outstanding actively traded securities at the time the security was
acquired by the partnership; (ii) the security is actively traded as
of the date of distribution; and (iii) the security was held by the
partnership for at least six months before it became actively traded
and the security was distributed by the partnership within five years
of the date on which it became actively traded.

     Section 731(c) doesn't apply to the distribution of marketable
securities by an investment partnership to an eligible partner. The
regs contain provisions relating to that exception. The proposed
regulations also provide rules for coordinating section 731(c) with
sections 704(c)(1)(B) and 737. Finally, the regs contain an anti-
abuse rule stating that the provisions of section 731(c) and the
regulations must be applied in a manner that's consistent with the
purpose of section 731(c) and the substance of the transaction.

     The regulations are proposed to apply to distributions of
marketable securities by a partnership to a partner on or after
December 29, 1995. A public hearing on the regs has been scheduled
for April 3, 1996, beginning at 10:00 a.m., in the IRS Auditorium in
Washington. Written comments on the proposed regulations and requests
to speak at the hearing (with outlines of oral comments) are due by
March 13, 1996.

           IRS CANCELS HEARING ON PROPOSED SUBPART F REGS.

     The Service has canceled the public hearing on the proposed
regulations (IL-75-92) under sections 952, 954(c), and 960 relating
to the definition of subpart F income and foreign personal holding
company income of a controlled foreign corporation and the allocation
of deficits for purposes of computing the deemed-paid foreign tax
credit. The hearing had been scheduled to take place on January 4,
1996. (For text of the proposed regulations, see 95 TNT 175-7 or H&D,
Sept. 7, 1995, Special Supplement.)

   IRS PROPOSES RULES ON TRANSFERS OF STOCK IN U.S. CORPORATIONS TO
                        FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.

     The Service has issued proposed regulations under section 367
concerning transfers of stock or securities of domestic corporations
by United States persons to foreign corporations pursuant to a
corporate organization, reorganization, or liquidation.

 IRS PROPOSES RULES FOR ALLOCATION OF ACCRUED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS.

     The Service has issued proposed regulations (EE-35-95) under
section 411 that provide rules for calculating an employee's accrued
benefit derived from the employee's contributions to a qualified
defined benefit pension plan. The regs reflect changes made by the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 and the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, which amended the law to change the
accumulation of employee contributions and the conversion of those
accumulated contributions to employee-derived accrued benefits.

     Before OBRA '89, section 411(c)(2)(B) specified that the
conversion factor to be used to compute the employee-derived accrued
benefit was 10 percent for a straight life annuity beginning at
normal retirement age of 65, and that for other normal retirement
ages, the conversion factor was to be determined in accordance with
regulations. OBRA '89 deleted the 10 percent conversion factor and
replaced it with the requirement that the accumulated contributions
at normal retirement age be expressed as an annual benefit beginning
at normal retirement age using an interest rate that would be used
under the plan under section 417(e)(3).

     To reflect the OBRA '89 amendments, the proposed regulations
define "appropriate conversion factor" for an accrued benefit
expressed in the form of an annual benefit that is nondecreasing for
the life of the participant as the present value of an annuity in the
form of that annual benefit beginning at normal retirement age at a
rate of $1 per year. That amount is to be computed using the interest
rate and mortality table that would be used under the plan under
section 417(e)(3) and reg. section 1.417(e)-1T. To reflect the post-
OBRA '89 conversion factor definition and to conform to common
actuarial practice, the proposed regs would change the "multiplied
by" language in reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(1) to "divided by."

     Section 411(c)(2)(C), as amended by OBRA '89, provides that an
interest rate of 120 percent of the applicable federal midterm rate
under section 1274 is to be used for accumulating contributions only
up to the "determination date." For the period from the determination
date to normal retirement age, the interest rate that would be used
under section 417(e)(3) must be used. The proposed regs would amend
existing reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(3) to reflect those rates.

     Proposed reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(5)(i) defines "determination
date" for purposes of section 411(c)(2)(C)(iii) in a case in which a
participant will receive his or her entire accrued benefit derived
from employee contributions in any one of the following forms: an
annuity that is substantially nonincreasing, substantially
nonincreasing installment payments for a fixed number of years, or a
single sum distribution. In such a case, "determination date" means
the date on which distribution of the benefit begins. For that
purpose, an annuity that is nonincreasing except for automatic
increases to reflect increases in the consumer price index is
considered to be an annuity that is substantially nonincreasing.

     The regulations are proposed to be effective for plan years
beginning on or after January 1, 1997.

     FINAL REGS PROVIDE RULES FOR CASH REPORTING BY COURT CLERKS.

     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8652) under
section 6050I(g) on the information reporting requirements for
federal and state court clerks on receipt of more than $10,000 in
cash as bail for any individual charged with a specified criminal
offense. T.D. 8652 adopts with revisions the temporary and proposed
regulations (T.D. 8572; IA-57-94) that were published on December 15,
1994.

     The 1994 regulations provided that a clerk is the clerk's office
or the office, department, division, branch, or unit of the court
that is authorized to receive bail. According to the Service, a
commentator suggested that the regs clarify whether reporting under
section 6050I(g) is required by a clerk if an entity that is not a
part of the court receives bail. In some jurisdictions, for example,
a sheriff receives bail. The final regulations provide that if
someone other than a clerk receives bail on behalf of a clerk, the
clerk is treated as receiving the bail. Therefore, the clerk must
file the information return.

     Under the 1994 regs, a statement must be sent to each payer of
bail reporting certain information, including the aggregate amount of
reportable cash received by the clerk. The final regulations clarify
that the aggregate amount requirement can be satisfied either by
sending a single written statement with an aggregate amount listed or
by furnishing a copy of each Form 8300 relating to that payer of bail.

     The final regulations also clarify that if multiple payments are
made to satisfy bail reportable under section 6050I(g) and the
initial payment doesn't exceed $10,000, the initial payment and
subsequent payments must be aggregated and the information return
must be filed by the 15th day after receipt of the payment that
causes the aggregate amount to exceed $10,000. However, payments made
to satisfy separate bail requirements aren't required to be
aggregated.

   IRS FINALIZES ALLOCATION AND APPORTIONMENT RULES FOR R&E COSTS.

     The Service has issued final regulations under section 861
concerning the allocation and apportionment of research and
experimental (R&E) expenditures for purposes of determining taxable
income from U.S. and non-U.S. sources. The regulations do not make
major changes in the proposed regulations, and are effective January
1, 1996.

     The proposed regulations contained three principal changes in
to the existing regs. First, allocation of R&E costs to three digit
-- rather than two digit -- SIC code product categories of gross
income would be permitted. Second, the percentage of R&E costs that
may be exclusively apportioned to U.S.-source income under the sales
method of apportionment under reg. section 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii) would be
increased from 30 percent to 50 percent. And third, use of the
optional gross income methods of apportionment would constitute a
binding election to use those methods in subsequent years.

     The Service agreed to a change regarding the optional gross
income methods of apportionment. It was suggested that the final
rules include a 50 percent exclusive place of performance
apportionment under the optional gross income methods to be parallel
with reg. section 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii)(A). The final regs don't go that
far: they include a 25 percent exclusive place of performance
apportionment under the optional gross income methods.

     The regs also change the binding election rules: IRS permission
will not be required to change methods under reg. section 1.861-
8(e)(3)(iii)(C), provided that the taxpayer has used one method for
five years.

   FINAL REGS PROVIDE PAL RULES FOR RENTAL REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES.

     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8645) under
section 469 providing rules for rental real estate activities of
taxpayers engaged in real property trades or businesses. The
regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. The final regulations adopt the proposed
regs (PS-80-93) published on January 10, 1995, with revisions. (For
the full text, see 95 TNT 6-11.)

     OBRA '93 added section 469(c)(7), which provides that rental
real estate activities of qualifying taxpayers are not subject to the
rule that treats all rental activities as passive. It also provides
that each of a qualifying taxpayer's interests in rental real estate
is treated as a separate activity unless the taxpayer elects to treat
all interest in rental real estate as a single activity.

     The proposed regs provided rules for determining whether a
taxpayer qualifies for treatment under section 469(c)(7). Except for
modifications in response to comments received on the proposed regs,
the final regs generally adopt the rules in the proposed regs.

     Citing the statutory language and legislative history, the
Service said the final regs retain the rule in the proposed regs
prohibiting qualifying taxpayers from grouping rental real estate
activities with other activities in determining whether the taxpayers
materially participate in the rental real estate activities. It said
it invites comments, however, on whether the material participation
tests in reg. section 1.469-5T(a) should be amended to include a
look-back material participation test for taxpayers significantly
involved in the development or construction of their rental real
estate interests.

     The final regs are effective for tax years beginning on or after
January 1, 1995.

     PARTNERSHIP PROPERTY DISTRIBUTION REGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED.

     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8642) under
section 704(c) relating to the recognition of gain or loss on the
distribution of contributed property by a partnership under section
704(c)(1)(B). T.D. 8642 also provides final rules on the recognition
of gain on certain distributions to a contributing partner under
section 737.

     The final regs clarify the proposed rules in a number of
respects, but do not make major changes. The final regs are effective
January 9, 1995. (For text of the proposed regs (PS-76-92), see 95
TNT 5-7 or H&D, Jan. 9, 1995, p. 515.)

     The Service noted that a clarification was sought on the
interaction of the like-kind exception and the disguised sale rules
of section 707(a)(2)(B). The Service says there's "no suggestion in
section 704(c)(2) or the proposed regulations that the like-kind
exception was intended as an exception to the disguised sale
provisions." The final regs confirm that the disguised sale rules can
apply to a distribution, "even if the distribution would otherwise
have qualified for the section 704(c)(2) like-kind exception."

     Despite numerous suggestions for "clarifying or modifying the
anti-abuse rule in the proposed regulations," the final regs adopt
the proposed rule without change.

       FINAL GSTT REGS ELIMINATE CONTROVERSIAL 'SPOUSAL RULE.'

     The Service has issued final generation-skipping transfer tax
regulations (T.D. 8644) under chapter 13 of the code. T.D. 8644
adopts with revisions proposed regulations (PS-73-88; PS-32-90)
published on December 24, 1992. The final regulations are effective
December 27, 1995.

     One notable change concerns the estate tax inclusion period
(ETIP). Proposed reg. section 26.2632-1(c)(2)(ii) provided that an
ETIP existed during the period in which the transferred property
would have been includable in the transferor's gross estate had the
transferor retained an interest held by the transferor's spouse, but
only to the extent the spouse acquired the interest from the
transferor in an inter vivos transfer that was not included in the
transferor's taxable gifts or for which a deduction was allowed under
section 2523. According to the Service, commentators stated that
there was no support in the statute for that spousal rule, and any
such rule would require a legislative change. The final regs
eliminate the spousal rule and Example 5 of reg. section 26.2632-
1(c)(5).

     Some of the other more significant revisions involve various
definitions. Proposed reg. section 26.2612-1(a)(2)(i) provided
generally that for purposes of determining whether a transfer
constitutes a direct skip, the generation assignment of a person who
would otherwise be a skip person is redetermined by disregarding the
intervening generation, if certain individuals have died before the
transfer (for example, a predeceased child of the transferor). That
section has been modified to provide that if an individual who is a
member of the intervening generation dies no later than 90 days after
the transfer, the deceased individual is treated as having
predeceased the transferor, if the governing instrument or applicable
state law provides for that treatment.

     Further, reg. section 26.2612-1(a)(2)(ii) has been added to
provide that if a transferor makes an addition to an existing trust
after the death of an individual described in section 26.2612-
1(a)(2)(i) (that is, an individual in the intervening generation),
the additional property is treated as being held in a separate trust
for purposes of chapter 13.

     Other revisions, modifications, and clarifications to the
proposed regulations concern the transition rules, the uniform
statutory rule against perpetuities, allocation of the GST exemption,
erroneous allocations, the determination of the applicable fraction,
the division of a single trust into separate trusts, and the
application of chapter 13 to nonresident aliens.

      IRS UPDATES RULES FOR FORM 1040 ONLINE ELECTRONIC FILING.

     The Service in Revenue Procedure 96-20 has set forth guidelines
and requirements for those who participate in the 1996 online
electronic filing program for Forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ. Rev.
Proc. 96-20 updates and supersedes Rev. Proc. 95-13, 1995-1 C.B. 514.
The updates include changes in the online filing program for the 1996
filing season, clarification of prior online filing program
statements, and additional guidance derived from other IRS documents
that relate to the online filing program.

         SUSPENDED S CORPORATION LOSSES AREN'T TRANSFERABLE.

     In technical advice, the Service has ruled that a taxpayer may
not deduct losses disallowed and suspended under section 1366(d)(1)
at a time when the taxpayer's former spouse owned the S corporation
stock.

     The husband and wife separately owned shares of the S
corporation's stock. In a year when the corporation had a loss, a
portion of the husband's loss was disallowed at the shareholder level
because the loss exceeded his adjusted basis in the stock.

     The husband subsequently transferred all of his stock in the
corporation to the wife incident to their divorce. As of that date,
the husband had not taken the carried over losses.

     For the tax year at issue, the wife deducted the losses carried
over from the year when the husband owned the stock. On audit, the
losses were disallowed because they were associated with stock owned
by the husband and, the IRS agent asserted, could not be transferred
to the wife.

     Agreeing with the auditing agent, the Service pointed out that
section 1366(d)(2) provides that any loss disallowed by the basis
limitation in section 1366(d)(1) is treated as incurred by the
corporation in the succeeding tax year "with respect to that
shareholder." The use of the words "with respect to that
shareholder," the Service said, requires that losses be personal to a
shareholder and that they not be transferred in any manner.

     The Service further concluded that section 1041 doesn't change
that result, adding that no gain or loss is recognized on the
husband's transfer of the stock to the wife. The transfer is treated
as a gift, it said, and the wife's basis in the stock is the
husband's adjusted basis at the time of the transfer.

    COMPANY MUST PAY INTEREST ON BACKUP WITHHOLDING TAX LIABILITY.

     The Service has ruled in technical advice that a corporation is
liable for interest regarding backup withholding tax liability
imposed by section 3406.

     In 1992, the corporation was selected for a Form 1099 compliance
check for the years 1990 and 1991. At the conclusion of the
compliance check, the IRS examiner proposed assessments for backup
withholding tax liability under section 3406 because the corporation
filed Forms 1099 without taxpayer identification numbers. Also,
penalties were assessed under section 6721 for failure to file
correct Forms 1099 and under section 6722 for failure to furnish
correct Forms 1099.

     Most of the backup withholding tax liability asserted against
the corporation was abated under section 3402(d); however, interest,
penalties, and a portion of the backup withholding tax liability were
not abated. No agreement was reached at the examination level or at
IRS Appeals. The IRS district director made a notice and demand for
the assessed taxes and interest.

     The Service noted that the corporation would not be liable for
interest if the interest-free adjustment provisions of section 6205
applied. If the corporation had satisfied that section's requirements
for reporting the tax and making a supplemental return, it could
qualify for an adjustment of its backup withholding tax liability.
However, the Service pointed out, notice and demand for payment of
the tax due was made before the filing of the supplemental return (or
the deemed filing of a supplemental return by signing an agreement to
the adjustment). Consequently, under reg. section 31.6205-1(a)(6),
the interest-free adjustment provisions of section 6205 don't apply.

     Therefore, the Service concluded, regarding the backup
withholding tax that has been abated under section 3402(d), the
corporation is liable for interest for the periods beginning with the
due date of the return for the period in which it was required to
withhold, but failed to do so, until the recipient of the reportable
payment satisfied his federal income tax liability for the period at
issue. Regarding liability for backup withholding tax that hasn't
been abated, the Service said, the corporation is liable for interest
for the periods beginning with the due date of the return for the
period in which it was required to withhold, but didn't, until it
pays the tax, or the recipient pays income tax on the reportable
amount, whichever is earlier.

       SELF-UNLOADING FARM VEHICLES ARE SUBJECT TO EXCISE TAX.

     The Service has ruled in technical advice that a self-unloading
automobile truck body manufactured by a company and sold through its
retail division is subject to the section 4051 excise tax.

     The company is in the business of manufacturing agricultural
equipment, including the self-unloading truck body. The body has a V-
shaped bottom that the company says was designed to haul farm cargo
such as seed and harvested potatoes. The body has a variable speed
unloading conveyer belt and a drive system that may be driven by the
transmission's power take-off. The variable speed function is
incorporated into the design of the unloading system to match the
unloading speeds required for each type of load that may be carried
by the body. The company's sales literature states that the body may
be used to haul seed, potatoes, beets, and small grains.

     In ruling that sales of the truck body were taxable, the Service
pointed out that the exemption provided by section 4053(2) doesn't
extend to truck bodies designed for general use, even though the
bodies are used to transport farm cargo. To be exempt, it said, a
body must be primarily designed to haul seed, feed, or fertilizer to
and on farms. The Service found the truck bodies in question to be
functionally similar to those described in Rev. Rul. 75-462, 1975-2
C.B. 419, in that they are not primarily designed to haul seed, feed,
or fertilizer. Rather, as suggested in the company's sales
literature, the bodies in question are designed for general hauling
of farm cargo, in addition to seed, the Service concluded.

 FUND-RAISING ORGANIZATION'S OPERATION OF FISHING FACILITY GIVES RISE
                TO UBIT; ROYALTY ARGUMENT IS REJECTED.

     The Service has ruled that amounts a section 501(c)(3) fund-
raising organization receives in operating fishing facilities at a
lake are subject to unrelated business income tax.

     Under an agreement with an other entity, the exempt organization
is licensed, for a fee, to occupy and use a lake and the adjoining
support facilities (a dock), to provide the public with a lake area
specifically for fishing on alternate weekends, year-round. The
exempt sells fishing passes to the public on a first-come, first-
served basis. Activities at the lake are controlled by paid personnel
who operate a ticket office, police the facility, and supervise the
dock and boat ramp. General recreation activities, such as picnicking
and swimming, are prohibited at the lake.

     No apparent charitable activity takes place at the lake. The
fund-raising organization entered the license agreement solely to
generate revenues which, after the payment of expenses, will be
distributed to client social service and welfare agencies.

     The Service concluded that payments the exempt receives from the
general public for use of the lake are income from an unrelated trade
or business regularly carried on. The Service noted that usage of the
lake is similar to any commercial fishing facility. Comparing the
arrangement to greens fees paid to play golf, the Service said the
admission fee is a charge for the provision of personal services.

    GAO DEEMS 1995 FILING SEASON GOOD -- DESPITE SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

     The General Accounting Office has concluded that the IRS had a
successful 1995 filing season, although the agency still had some
serious difficulties, particularly on the public relations front.

     Although IRS indicators show that most of the 1995 filing season
goals were met, the GAO found, anti-fraud initiatives caused much
adverse publicity, taxpayers continued to have serious problems
reaching the IRS on the telephone, and a new document system designed
to increase productivity failed to do so.

     The GAO praised IRS steps to combat fraud, but said the outcry
over the delay of more than 7 million refunds could have been avoided
had the IRS done a better job of communicating that even taxpayers
with legitimate returns might be subject to a delay.

 IRS ISSUES TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED REGS ON TRANSFERS OF STOCK IN U.S.
                CORPORATIONS TO FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.

     The Service has issued temporary and proposed regulations (T.D.
8638; INTL-9-95) under section 367 concerning transfers of stock or
securities of domestic corporations by United States persons to
foreign corporations pursuant to the code's corporate organization,
reorganization, or liquidation provisions. To a large degree, the
regulations simply update and coordinate temporary guidance provided
since the relevant statutory changes were enacted in 1984.

     Temporary and proposed regulations issued in May 1986 included
section 1.367(a)-3T, which relates to transfers of stock or
securities of domestic or foreign corporations by U.S. persons to
foreign corporations. The Service modified those regulations in
Notice 87-85, 1987-2 C.B. 395. Regulations based on Notice 87-85 were
issued in August 1991, and further guidance was provided in Notice
94-46, 1994-1 C.B. 356. The regulations that have been set forth in
T.D. 8638 incorporate and modify the rules announced in Notice 94-46.

     The positions taken in Notice 94-46 have been modified in two
significant ways. First, the regulations shift the ownership
threshold from "50 percent or more" to "more than 50 percent," so
that a U.S. transferor may qualify for an exception to section 367(a)
in situations where U.S. transferors, in the aggregate, receive
exactly 50 percent of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation
in the exchange.

     Second, although the new regulations retain the presumption that
shareholders of the U.S. target company are U.S. persons, generally
it does not retain the cross-ownership presumption or take cross-
ownership into account. The Service explained that the regulations
count cross-ownership "only in the limited circumstance where U.S.
officers, directors, and 5 percent or greater shareholders of the
U.S. target company own, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent of
the total voting power or the total value of the transferee foreign
corporation immediately after the transfer (a control group case)."
In such a case, the Service said, the exchange is taxable to all U.S.
transferors.

  IRS RELEASES 1988 INTERNAL NOTICE OUTLINING PURPOSE OF LITIGATION
                           GUIDELINE MEMOS.

     The Service has released a 1988 internal notice that outlines
the purpose of Litigation Guideline Memorandums (LGMs). The notice
characterizes LGMs as "Law Enforcement Manual directives" not subject
to public release.

     According to the internal notice, N (32)210-1, the purpose of
LGMs is to provide "information and instruction relating to
litigating procedures and methods," along with "standards and
criteria on issues and matters of significant interest to litigating
attorneys in the Office of Chief Counsel."

     The notice states that LGMs "are NOT to be released to the
public" and "are to be printed on blue paper to distinguish them from
nonprotected directives and to avoid inadvertent disclosure."

          ACTUARIAL EXAM COMMITTEE TO MEET JANUARY 8 AND 9.

     The Service has announced that the Joint Board for the
Enrollment of Actuaries Advisory Committee on Actuarial Examinations
will meet on January 8 and 9, 1996, to discuss topics and questions
for inclusion on future examinations in actuarial mathematics and
methodology. The committee will also review the November 1995
examination in order to make recommendations relative to it,
including the minimum acceptable passing score.

     The committee will meet in the Conference Room of the Office of
Director of Practice, Suite 600, 801 Pennsylvania Ave., NW,
Washington, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each day. The portions of the
meeting dealing with future exam questions and the review of the
November exam will be closed to the public.

          NADER ASKS CEOs TO SUPPORT CORPORATE WELFARE CUTS.

     To usher in the New Year, Ralph Nader is asking CEOs who wrote
President Clinton and Congress calling for a balanced budget
agreement to identify and list federal subsidies and tax expenditures
that benefit their companies they would agree to forgo.

     In a letter he is sending to the 91 CEOs who signed the December
19 letter to budget negotiators, Nader pointed out that the
elimination of five corporate tax expenditures would provide an
additional $46.4 billion in revenue in fiscal year 1996. The consumer
advocate's five tax expenditure targets included accelerated
depreciation on equipment and buildings, reduced rates on the first
$10,000 of corporate taxable income, the exception to the source rule
for inventory property sales, the possessions tax credit, and the
expensing of research and development costs.

UNITED KINGDOM RENTAL INCOME OF NON-RESIDENTS

Regulations have been published setting out the details of the new
mechanisms for taxing rental income from UK property in the hands of
non-residents. The rules introduced in the 1995 Finance Act are
designed to bring the taxation of income in such circumstances within
the scope of the new self assessment system. They apply to rent and
other income paid from April 6, 1996.

Under the existing rules tenants, broadly, are obliged to withhold tax
at the rate of 25 per cent on gross rental income paid to non-resident
landlords. Informal arrangements were possible to pay on a net basis
where a UK agent was employed and an annual tax return was filed on
behalf of the non-resident landlord.

The new regulations set out in detail the obligations of non-resident
landlords, their agents and tenants.

Non-residents

The scheme applies to landlords whose "usual place of abode is outside
the UK". This unfortunate expression has been continued in the new
legislation and its precise meaning is unclear. Although in some
respects this corresponds broadly with residence for tax purposes, it
is not identical. A booklet issued by the Inland Revenue interprets the
expression as follows: It considers individuals who usually live
outside the UK as being covered by the scheme. This does not include
someone who is temporarily living outside the UK for six months or
less.

This does not include someone who is temporarily???? In relation to
companies, it covers those that have their main office or other place
of business outside the UK.

It notes that companies incorporated outside the UK will normally have
a usual place of abode outside the UK. Companies which are treated as
resident in the UK for tax purposes will not be regarded as having a
usual place of abode outside the UK. It also notes that the scheme does
not apply to the rental income of UK branches of non-resident
companies.

Trustees are regarded as having a usual place of abode outside the UK
if all the trustees have a usual place of abode outside the UK.

The Inland Revenue booklet notes that normally where a person is
treated as non-UK resident for tax purposes they will have a usual
place of abode outside the UK. It is clear however that the two
concepts are not viewed by the Inland Revenue as being identical.

Tax Base

The regulations require prescribed persons to deduct tax at the basic
rate from UK rental income, pay the tax quarterly to the Inland Revenue
and submit annual information returns setting out income expenses and
tax deducted. The basic rate from April 6, 1996 is 24 per cent.

Letting agents

Primary liability rests with letting agents. These are defined in the
legislation as persons who act on behalf of the non-resident in
connection with the management or administration of its UK property
rental business.

A statement by the Inland Revenue in a recent tax bulletin indicates
that they view this as a wide definition which includes those who act
in an informal manner such as friends or relatives as well as
professionals such as estate agents who collect rent. It does not cover
banks who merely provide accounts into which the income is paid.

In addition it applies to agents only if they handle or control UK
rental income on behalf of the non-resident. Therefore, accountants who
do no more than prepare accounts and tax returns or agents who merely
find tenants in return for fees without collecting any rent are not
included.

Persons who provide legal services are specifically excluded. This
covers solicitors recovering arrears of rent or receiving apportioned
rents in the course of a sale of property. If, however, solicitors
collect the first payment of rent after drawing up the lease they will
be covered because that is viewed as going beyond the provision of
legal advice or services.

Tenants

Where there is no letting agent the tenant must operate the scheme in
most cases. Tenants who pay rent of #100 per week or less are excluded
unless served with a notice from the Inland Revenue to operate the
scheme.

In either case the withholding person is required to register with the
Inland Revenue. Tax is paid to the Inland Revenue quarterly.

In the case of letting agents tax is deducted against:

- all Schedule A income, plus

- other Schedule A income paid away by the tenant in the quarter at the
letting agents direction, less

- expenses paid in the quarter which the agent can reasonably be
satisfied are allowable expenses of the non-resident landlord.

If expenses in the quarter exceed income received then the agent may
carry back surplus expenses to earlier quarters in the same year ended
at March 31 taking later quarters before earlier ones. Any surplus
expenses not used in this manner may be carried forward to future
quarters including those in a later year.

In the case of tenants, tax is calculated on:

- Schedule A income paid in the quarter to the non-resident landlord,
plus

- Schedule A income paid to a third party not being a payment they can
reasonably be satisfied is an allowable expense of the landlord.

Tenants must show the tax due on a quarterly return submitted with
payment within 30 days of the end of the quarter. In the case of
letting agents they will both return and pay in respect of all non-
resident landlords they represent. As tenants calculate tax on amounts
paid there is no carry back of surplus expenses.

Schedule A Business

Income from property underwent a significant reform in the 1995 Finance
Act (see FTWTR December 1994 page 228). Schedule A business essentially
comprises all property rental and the scheme covers income received by
or within the control of a letting agent or where there is no letting
agent, amounts paid by a tenant. It includes all annual profits or
gains arising from any land in the UK including income from the letting
or licensing of any furnished or unfurnished property and any premiums
chargeable as income rent charges ground rents etc.

Deductible expenses

The test for deductibility is now similar to that in relation to
trading activities. Expenses are those which the agent or tenant can be
reasonably satisfied are allowable in computing the profits of the non-
residents Schedule A business paid by the agent or the tenant. The
Inland Revenue proposes to publish guidance notes on this subject. If
the guidance notes are followed there will be no penalty for deducting
expenses which ultimately turn out not to be deductible.

They have warned where agents are unable to satisfy themselves whether
an expense is deductible, for example where there is insufficient
information about the purpose of the expenditure, they should not
deduct it.

Payment without deduction of tax

The regulations make provision for non-residents to receive rental
income without deduction of tax. Application may be made which when
approved will permit agents or tenants to pay without deduction of tax.
This may be allowed where the non-residents' UK tax affairs are up to
date or where they have never had any UK tax obligations or where they
do not expect to be liable to UK income tax (for example where expenses
will likely exceed income).

In each case they must undertake to comply with all their UK
obligations including filing of all returns and paying tax due on time.

The Inland Revenue will give reasons for any refusal and an appeal may
be made against such a refusal. Agents and tenants will be notified of
the obligation to resume withholding if the approval is withdrawn.

TRANSFER PRICING - UNITED STATES COST SHARING REGULATIONS

Code S482 was amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to require that
consideration for the use of intangible property transferred in a
controlled transaction must be commensurate with the income generated
by the item of intangible property. Congress did not intend to preclude
multinational groups from entering into bona fide research and
development cost sharing arrangements as an appropriate method of
allocating income attributable to intangibles among related parties.

The IRS issued a study of intercompany pricing in 1988 known as "the
White Paper". The White Paper suggested that most bona fide cost
sharing arrangements should have certain provisions.

For example, cost sharing arrangements should cover all research within
a particular three-digit SIC code, most participants should be assigned
exclusive geographic rights in developed intangibles (and should be
able to predict benefits and divide costs accordingly), and marketing
intangibles should be excluded from bona fide cost sharing
arrangements.

The IRS issued proposed cost sharing regulations in 1992.

The final regulations issued in December 1995 define a cost sharing
arrangement as an agreement for sharing costs in proportion to
reasonably anticipated benefits from the individual exploitation of
interests in the intangibles that are developed. Although a taxpayer
must satisfy certain formal requirements to contend that a cost sharing
arrangement exists, the IRS may apply the cost sharing rules to any
arrangement that in substance constitutes a cost sharing arrangement.
For a US-based company, this could result in a loss of R&D deductions.

The final regulations provide that neither a qualified cost sharing
arrangement nor an arrangement treated in substance as such, will be
treated as a partnership. Moreover, a foreign participant will not be
treated as being engaged in a trade or business within the US solely by
virtue of its participation in such an arrangement.

The final regulations emphasize the move away from a strict use of
numeric ratios in measuring the sharing of costs with the anticipated
benefits. Thus, for example, no allocation will be made with respect to
a qualified cost sharing arrangement, except to make each controlled
participant's share of the intangible development costs equal to its
share of reasonably anticipated benefits.

Similarly, in listing the requirements for qualification, the final
regulations provide that the arrangement must provide a method to
calculate each controlled participant's share of intangible development
costs based on factors that can reasonably be expected to reflect
anticipated benefits. The new standard is intended to ensure that cost
sharing arrangements will not be disregarded by the IRS as long as the
factors upon which an estimate of benefits was based were reasonable,
even if the estimate proves inaccurate.

As under the proposed regulations, a cost sharing arrangement must be
set forth in writing and contain a number of specified provisions,
including the interest that each controlled participant will have
received in any intangibles developed, referred to as "covered
intangibles". If the research results in the development of intangible
property that was not foreseen at the inception of the cost sharing
arrangement, the property is also included as a covered intangible.

The final regulations permit participation by unrelated persons,
referred to as "uncontrolled participants", in a cost sharing
agreement. Controlled taxpayers may be participants, referred to as
"controlled participants", provided that they use or reasonably expect
to use covered intangibles in the active conduct of a trade or
business. An entity that chiefly provides services as a contract
researcher may not be a controlled participant. However, nothing
prevents a service entity such as a contract researcher from furnishing
research and development services to the members of a qualified cost
sharing arrangement in return for appropriate consideration.

As under the proposed regulations, the activity of another person may
be attributed to a controlled taxpayer for purposes of meeting the
active conduct requirement. However, the standard has changed. In the
proposed regulations, the controlled taxpayer merely had to bear the
risk and receive the benefits of the attributed activity. Under the
final regulations the attribution will be made only where the
controlled taxpayer exercises substantial managerial and operational
control over the attributed activities. Thus, a shell entity is
unlikely to qualify for participation.

The final regulations define intangible development costs as operating
expenses other than depreciation and amortization expense, and an arm's
length charge for tangible property made available to cost sharing
arrangements. As under the proposed regulations, the IRS may adjust the
pool of costs shared in order to properly reflect costs that relate to
the intangible development area.

The final regulations define anticipated benefits as additional income
generated or costs saved by the use of covered intangibles. The pool of
benefits may also be adjusted in order to properly reflect benefits
that relate to the intangible development area. Anticipated benefits of
uncontrolled participants will be excluded.

A share of reasonably anticipated benefits will be determined using the
most reliable estimate of benefits. This rule echoes the best method
rule for determining the most reliable measure of an arm's length
result under the substantive transfer pricing regulations. The
reliability of an estimate of benefits principally depends on two
factors; the reliability of the basis for measuring benefits used and
the reliability of the projections used.

The cost to operating income ratio used in the proposed regulations to
check the reasonableness of an effort to share costs in proportion to
anticipated benefits is deleted from the final regulations. Instead, an
allocation of costs or income may be made if the taxpayer did not use
the most reliable estimate of benefits. That determination will depend
on the facts and circumstances of each case. The most reliable basis
for measuring anticipated benefits must be used and the measurement
basis must be consistent for all controlled participants. The
regulations provide that benefits may be measured directly or
indirectly.

In addition, regardless of whether a direct or indirect basis of
measurement is employed, it may be necessary to make adjustments to
account for material differences in the activities that controlled
participants perform in connection with exploitation of covered
intangibles, such as between wholesale and retain distribution.
Indirect bases for measuring benefits may include units of production,
sales, operating profit and any other factor that bears a relationship
to benefits.

The final regulations provide that projections used to estimate
benefits must include a projection of the time over which benefits will
be received and a projection of the benefits anticipated for each year
in the period. A significant divergence between projected and actual
benefit shares may indicate that the projections were not reliable. A
significant divergence is defined as divergence in excess of 20 per
cent between projected and actual benefit shares.

If there is a significant divergence, which is not due to an
unforeseeable event, the IRS may use actual benefits as the most
reliable basis for measuring benefits. Conversely, no allocation will
be made based on a divergence that is not considered significant as
long as the estimate is made using the most reliable basis for
measuring benefits. For purposes of the 20 per cent test, all non US
controlled participants are treated as a single controlled participant
in order that a divergence by a foreign controlled participant with a
very small share of the total costs will not necessarily trigger an
allocation.

A taxpayer receiving a cost sharing payment must reduce its research
and development expense. The final regulations adopt a net approach to
foster simplicity and preserve the character of items actually incurred
by a participant to the extent not reimbursed.

Any payment that in substance constitutes a cost sharing payment will
be treated as such, regardless of its characterization under foreign
law. This rule is intended to enable foreign entities to participate in
cost sharing arrangements with US controlled participants even if
foreign law does not recognise cost sharing.

KATZ COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM

The Katz Commission of Inquiry into tax reform (see FTWTR January 1995
p3) released their Third Interim Report in December 1995.

The thrust of the First Interim Report was that the Revenue
administration had to be restructured to ensure effective revenue
collection and to make meaningful tax reform possible.

In an announcement at the end of 1995, the Government accepted most of
the Commission's recommendations on administrative reform. These
include the establishment of a combined Inland Revenue and Customs
authority with a greater degree of independence than before. The
effectiveness of collection is expected to improve almost immediately.
The longer term benefit will only be realised over several years.
Several recommendations are not final in this report, although
important indications of future developments are recorded.

Retirement Savings

The most comprehensive recommendation in the Third Interim Report is
for retirement funds to be brought into the tax net. This deviates from
the decades long South African formula of deductible contributions to
pension funds, exempt build-up in the funds, and taxability on payout.
The Commission recommended a 30 per cent flat rate tax on normal
taxable income in the funds. The recommendations are motivated by two
considerations. First, assets of some R500 billion, an appreciable part
of the economy, are controlled through these funds; over the years this
has brought about a massive, structural inducement to arbitrage between
the taxable and exempt sectors of the economy. Second, the retirement
industry has enjoyed a degree of fiscal privilege which is viewed as
incompatible with other priorities in a democratic society.

The current tax exemption for payments from public sector funds should
disappear. Differences in tax treatment between pension, provident, and
benefit funds are to be removed, especially those concerning
deductibility of contributions. Limitations on deductibility are to be
eased. Lump-sum payouts are to be taxed at progressive rates with
reference to a capital sum; thereafter pensions, whether in lump sum or
through annuity, will be untaxed. Transitional measures are proposed to
ensure that no vested rights are affected. The Commission has expressed
the view that at least some of the additional tax collected should be
applied towards relief in the income tax area.

Business Tax Issues

Corporate profits - The report expresses a preference over the longer
term for an imputation type system, but finds that current
administrative capacity and the likely lesser sophistication of an
emerging corporate sector militate against real progress at this time.
The current system of a Secondary Tax on Companies (STC) should
therefore be retained; however, the STC rate of 25 per cent on
distributed profits has a distortionary effect and should be reduced to
something like 15 per cent.

Several more detailed measures are proposed to streamline the STC. None
affect the basic principle that STC is an additional tax on companies
upon distribution and dividends are untaxed in the hands of recipients.

The Commission noted the acceptance by the UK authorities of the STC as
a creditable tax for treaty purposes and an apparent acceptance by the
Japanese authorities that the tax will qualify for foreign tax credit
purposes.

The Commission took cognisance of the fact that the STC is not
currently enforced against foreign businesses operating in South Africa
in the form of a branch. After rejecting a branch profits tax the
Commission recommended that this tax be abolished for branches rather
than to be retained and not enforced.

Group Taxation - South Africa currently has no general group tax
system. Each corporate entity is regarded as a separate taxpayer. The
Commission strongly criticised this and recommends introduction of an
elective group basis of taxation. In view of expected administrative
deficiencies, it proposes a gradual introduction.

Initially a group will be defined as involving only 100 per cent
affiliations (employee shares excepted). Losses carried forward into
the new system will not be allowed against group profits. Initially
only current year losses will be dealt with on a group basis. The
intention is to extend the degree of full consolidation group
treatment.

Share Incentives - The Commission did not favour sweeping incentives to
encourage employee share ownership. It did recommend a system of
deferral on the fringe benefit tax consequences of employer assisted
finance for the acquisition of employer shares. It also recommended
that, proper dealers apart, it should be made clear that employees will
not be taxed on gains on employer shares.

Anti Avoidance - The current general anti-avoidance provision in the
Income Tax Act (Section 103) provides the taxpayer with two main
defences - namely that the transactions in question did not have a tax
advantage as sole or main objective and that they did not create rights
and obligations abnormal within the relevant circumstances. The latter
test has been increasingly interpreted by the courts as subjective, to
a point where it became very difficult to attack certain avoidance
schemes. The Commission proposed that the abnormality test should be
scrapped in favour of a bona fide business purpose test.

This will apply in all business situations. Private family transactions
will continue to be governed by a normality requirement. The Commission
suggested that the provisions should not apply where it could be shown
that the transaction would not result in misuse of the Income Tax Act.

Other Levies - The Commission strongly criticised the current Regional
Services Council Levies (low-rate levies on payroll and turnover), but
stopped short of recommending their abolition, mainly because their
fate could best be decided by the Financial and Fiscal Commission - a
body charged with adjudicating funding as between the various
provinces.

It favoured abolishing the financial services levy on financial
institutions in favour of including all fee based financial services
under the VAT net.

It recommended abolition of the marketable securities tax on share
transfers on the stock exchange, and similar stamp duties on other
transactions.

Other Matters

Capital Gains Tax - The Commission recommended against a capital gains
tax at this time. The benefits would not justify the cost, effort and
complexity; such a tax is not a priority. The Commission did recommend
that, should a capital gains tax ever be considered, assets would have
to be assigned a benchmark date value which would then not be subject
to the tax.

Instead, the Commission recommended continuation of the donations tax
and estate duty, although they could be merged into a new capital
transfer tax.

Land Tax - Study into the feasibility of a land tax continues. Insofar
as South Africa already taxes municipal property on a local government
level, such a tax will mainly affect rural land. The Commission has
already indicated that a land tax on the national level would be very
unlikely, but scope remains for such a tax on a local or regional
level. Further recommendations will be made in due course.

Taxpayer rights - The Commission proposed that the administration
articulate certain basic rights for taxpayers. In its First Interim
Report it has listed a number of provisions in the current law which
would probably fall foul of the Interim Constitution regarding basic
rights and administrative fairness.

In this report they proposed a Statement of Taxpayer Rights. This
statement will not constitute a legal Bill of Rights.

Implementing these principles will be a function of specific
legislation, Codes of Practice, intervention by the existing Public
Protector and a tax specific ombudsman.

EUROPEAN UNION: TRANSIT CHARGE UNDER PRIVATE CONTRACT

The European Court of Justice has ruled on the question as to whether a
transit charge payable under a private contract has equivalent effect
to a customs duty and is therefore illegal under European law in Eduard
de Bois et Fils SA and General Cargo Services v Garanor Exploitation
SA.

Garanor managed an international road station and brought proceedings
against two customers for non-payment of a contractually agreed charge
known as a "taxe de passage" (transit charge). The appellants were
forwarding agents and recognised as such by the customs authority. In
addition to paying rent to the respondent for premises at an
international road station where customs clearance operations are
normally completed, they paid a flat rate transit charge for each
vehicle in international transit calculated on the basis of monthly
returns by the appellants.

The charge was intended to cover expenses of the respondent in respect
of the performance by the customs and veterinary services of their
tasks as providers of services in the public interest.

The Court ruled that the charge is illegal under European law if it is
designed to compensate a private undertaking for bearing costs arising
from the performance of services in the public interest even if they
have not been imposed by the state but arise from an agreement
concluded by that undertaking with its customers.

EUROPEAN UNION: VAT ON RESEARCH PROGRAMMES

In response to a Parliamentary question, Commissioner Monti has
confirmed that under the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of
the European Community as reflected in Article 15(10) of the Sixth VAT
Directive, goods and services supplied to the Commission are exempt
from VAT, either directly or by means of a subsequent refund of tax.

He said that the Commission is anxious to ensure that organisations
which participate in Community funded research and technological
development programmes receive equal treatment under the common VAT
system. It will therefore monitor the situation carefully taking
appropriate measures as necessary.

The question raised concern that if individual universities and
research organisations have to reclaim VAT from the British Government,
they will find it almost impossible to do so if the Commission does not
intend to change the policy of globally claiming VAT on research
programmes from member state governments.

EUROPEAN UNION: DELAY IN DEFINITIVE VAT REGIME LIKELY

In response to a question in the European parliament the taxation
commissioner Mr Mario Monti has refused to give an assurance that the
definitive system for VAT will enter into force on January 1, 1997 as
stated in article 28 of the sixth VAT directive.

The directive was amended in 1991 to introduce a transitional
arrangement for a period of four years which is to expire on December
31, 1996. A final or definitive system was to enter into force
thereafter which was proposed to embrace the original system. This
envisages tax imposed in the country of origin of goods or services
only with input tax being claimed by business customers in the country
of destination based on the tax charged in the country of origin.

The transitional arrangements are however automatically extended until
the definitive system enters into effect.

Reasons given by the commission for the delay are the amount of work
done and the recent enlargement of the EU. They view it as unlikely
that the deadline will be met.

BELGIUM: WEALTH TAX HINT

Mr Elio di Rupo, the deputy prime minister of Belgium, has raised the
possibility of introducing a wealth tax and a "generalised social
levy", as a way of taking some of the pain out of spending cuts in this
year's budget.

Belgium already has high tax rates, but the government needs to raise
revenues to plug the budget deficit.

Mr di Rupo said: "The problem of social security will not be solved
only acting on the spending side and asking exclusively for an effort
from those who benefit from various social benefits".

FRANCE: FINANCE AMENDMENT LAW 1996

The Finance Amendment Law finally adopted by Parliament on December 21,
1995 has been submitted to the Constitutional Council ("Conseil
Constitutionnel"). Its entry into force depends on publication in the
"Journal Officiel" and the approval of the Constitutional Council.

Simplified Declaration System

Small or medium companies may be taxed under a special regime called
the simplified declaration tax system. Such companies may keep
simplified accounts and report their income on a simplified return. The
scope of application of this system has changed.

Previously, companies with annual turnover not exceeding Fr 3,800,000
for sales and lodging or Fr 1,100,000 for services, qualified for the
simplified system.

Under the new law, the thresholds are increased to Fr 5,000,000 for
sales and lodging and Fr 1,500,000 for services. The simplified regime
will now concern 60,000 to 70,000 companies representing 8 per cent of
those taxed under the normal regime.

The thresholds first apply to 1995 personal income tax, to corporate
income tax for tax years closed at December 31, 1995 and from January
1, 1996 for VAT.

VAT

The new law mainly enacts the second VAT Simplification Directive
95/7/EEC of April 10, 1995.

The transposition concerns operations of jobbing, ("travail a facon")
which are now treated as services; the territoriality of work and
expert evaluation on personal tangible property and transportation of
approach; the basis of taxation on import; suspensive customs regimes
and export procedure by sales notes.

Other VAT provisions which do not derive from the second simplification
Directive include a new simplified form of tax representation for
certain operations where no VAT is due in France.

Property

According to article 1115 of the French Tax Code (CGI), the purchase of
property by professional real property dealers is subject to
registration duty reduced from 18.6 per cent to 0.6 per cent if the
dealer undertakes to sell the property within four years from the date
of acquisition.

Because of the crisis in the property market, the 1992 finance
amendment bill extended the deadline for sale to December 31, 1996 for
property acquired before January 1, 1993.

The new law extends this for a further two years to December 31, 1998.
It also introduces a reduced tax rate for sales made between January 1,
1999 and December 31, 2001 as follows:

- sales in 1999 - 75 per cent
- sales in 2000 - 50 per cent
- sales in 2001 - 25 per cent

The tax is due in the month following the sale.

Sales benefitting from reduced tax are not subject to the 6 per cent
additional duty. This is normally due by dealers who do not comply with
their undertaking to sell within 4 years.

Interest on late payment at 0.75 per cent per month, remains. It
applies from expiry of the period during which the sale should have
been made.

Contribution of property realised from January 1, 1996 is not to be
considered as a sale for the application of article 1115 of the CGI.

Professional Income

Under article 93 of the CGI, the taxation of professional income is in
principle determined on a cash basis. Professional income comprises non
commercial income of professionals such as doctors or lawyers.

However, the tax administration accepts the accrual basis at the
taxpayers' request.

The accrual system option is now provided by law and must be exercised
before February 1 of a given year.

FRANCE: TAX LAUNCH DELAYED

The French government, under pressure from leaders of its own centre-
right majority, postponed for a month the launch of a new tax designed
to wipe out welfare deficits. "The contribution for the reimbursement
of the social deficit will apply from February 1, 1996" instead of
January 1, the Labour Ministry said.

A former budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a member of the ruling
RPR party, and a centrist former defence minister, Mr Francois Leotard,
had urged the government to delay the new 0.5 per cent income tax for a
year, saying the economy was too fragile to sustain it.

GERMANY: TREATY OVERRIDE

German bilateral tax treaties which eliminate German taxation on
foreign enterprises have allowed activities in Germany both without tax
and the bother of tax formalities. In the last few years domestic law
amendments have changed the whole situation.

Section 50d of the income tax act (Einkommensteurergesetz, Estg) has
been amended three times in the last three years. It now requires
payments subject to German withholding tax to be made without regard to
any tax treaty or the provisions implementing the EU parent-subsidiary
directive. The foreign creditor may only claim a refund of tax withheld
if he can prove that he is entitled to the treaty or EU benefit. Under
certain circumstances the debtor may apply to the competent authority
(the Bundesame fur Finanzen) for approval not to withhold tax.

If the foreign creditor is a company, the tax authorities may deny it
the exemption if the shareholders personally would not be entitled to
the tax exemption and if there are no economically convincing reasons
for using the company and the company has no commercial activities of
its own.

The importance of these provisions has grown because obligations to
withhold have been broadened. Previously, only licence fees, dividends
and similar profits were subject to withholding. Now the proceeds from
the sales of enterprises, real property and patents are subject to
withholding. The tax authorities require withholding on gross payments
rather than net profits.

These rules and the approach of the tax authorities have been widely
regarded as not conforming to treaty obligations and EU law. In
particular, treaty exemption of profits from commercial activities and
the parent/subsidiary directive's abolition of withholding taxes seem
contrary to the provisions.

The tax authorities emphasise that the rules and their application are
only onerous for German debtors and therefore do not discriminate
against foreign enterprises.

A number of cases have now focused on the issues. The first important
decision of the Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) was published in
1995. In a further decision in 1995 the Federal Tax Court has confirmed
and made clear its position.

The Federal tax court did not discuss the conflict with treaties but
pointed out that treaties are implemented by national legislation.
National legislation may be amended and overturned by further
legislation. This is what happened in the case of section 50d Estg
according to the Federal Tax Court. The consequences for contracting
states may be discussed between the governments but are not to be
regarded by the court according to German doctrine on public
international law.

In German tax law the practical approach has been different. It is
assumed that domestic tax law is not intended to infringe international
law. Domestic law and treaties are therefore to be interpreted so that
treaties could prevail over national law or that domestic law not be
read as contradicting a treaty. This is supported by section 2 of the
Act on Tax Procedure (Abgabenordunung), which gives a provision derived
from a tax treaty precedence before a provision of purely national law.

The latest court decision overturns the traditional method of
interpretation and will encourage the treaty overriding legislation
which Germany has recently begun to enact.

The decision only deals with a question under a bilateral treaty.
Conformity with EU law still has to be discussed.

GERMANY: JOBS THROUGH TAX BREAKS

Germany plans to encourage new business creation and give tax
concessions to small and medium sized enterprises as part of a
programme to boost employment, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance
minister, said on December 10, 1995.

"We are doing everything to encourage business start-ups and we want a
sensible company tax reform," he said in an interview with the
Financial Times.

As part of a "symmetrical finance policy" that reduces the government
deficit and taxes in parallel, Mr Waigel said he wanted to get rid of
Germany's wealth tax and the local trading capital tax, a levy that
taxes companies even when they do not make a profit.

He also wanted to blunt the impact of local profit taxes on small and
medium sized companies by lowering initial tax rates and giving
concessions to companies building up financial reserves.

"The government does its duty if it consolidates the budget and tries
to cut those taxes and levies within its power," he said. He denied
rumours that he was seeking to increase value added tax: "I do not have
such plans."

ITALY: 1996 BUDGET - FINAL STEP

The new tax measures connected with the 1996 Budget have definitively
entered into force following their approval by Parliament and
publication in the Official Gazette.

Mortgage and cadastral tax rates are increased to 2 per cent and tax
benefits for the purchase of first houses extended.

The deadline for companies' net worth tax has been extended to the

Tax benefits for companies in connection with new capital investments
have been extended to the end of 1996 in respect of undertakings
located in the depressed areas of Southern Italy, or having less than
20 employees and a turnover not exceeding 5 billion Lire. For all other
Italian companies such tax benefits have been extended only until April
1996.

Tax credits in respect of Personal Income Tax (IRPEF), Company Income
Tax (IRPEG) and Local Income Tax (ILOR) may now be assigned.

ITALY: NEW YEAR'S EVE DECREE

A Law Decree (which must be converted into Law by Parliament within
sixty days of its entry into force) was enacted by the government on
January 30, 1995. Tax measures in the decree complete those provided in
the 1996 Budget and are expected to ensure an increase in the State's
revenue of Lire 5,285 billion, of which Lire 3,800 billion will be
obtained by introducing new taxes and by extending the deadline of the
mass tax settlement while Lire 1,485 billion by reducing public
spending.

The mass tax settlement, which was previously applicable only with
regard to returns filed in respect of the tax years 1987 to 1993 (see
FTWTR August 1995 page 146; October 1995 p. 185) has now been extended
(with new conditions) also to years 1994 and 1995.

The cigarette price is increased by Lire 200. Excise duty rates on
spirits are increased by approximately 8 per cent. Excise duty
regarding "unleaded" petrol is increased by Lire 22.

Stamp-duties are increased from Lire 15,000 to 20,000 while stamp
duties at a fixed rate on invoices, receipts, documents etc. are
increased from Lire 2,000 to Lire 2,500.

Highway tolls are increased on average by 2.6 per cent.

NETHERLANDS: INTEREST DEDUCTION FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION

The Undersecretary of Finance has published the policy on the
deductibility of costs incurred with respect to a minority
participation qualifying for the participation exemption.

The participation exemption excludes from corporate income tax both
dividends and capital gains in respect of a qualifying participation
(article 13 of the 1969 Corporate Income Tax Act).

The shareholder will often incur costs with respect to the management
and financing of that participation. According to article 13, paragraph
1, these costs are not deductible, unless the owner can demonstrate
that they contribute to profits which are taxable in the Netherlands.

This rule may prove to be a serious problem for a Netherlands company
which acquires a minority participation in a concern which is active
both in the Netherlands and in other countries. The company may have
difficulties acquiring the information required to demonstrate that the
costs it incurred with respect to said participation contribute to
profits taxable in the Netherlands.

To accommodate companies which find themselves in this situation, the
Undersecretary of Finance recently stated that these costs are
considered to be incurred with respect to profits taxable in the
Netherlands if the minority participation has a "sufficient"
substantial relation with the Netherlands. This may be the case if the
Netherlands' business activities of the company in which the
participation is held are "material" in relation to the total business
activities of the concern of which that company is a part.

According to the Undersecretary, costs incurred with respect to a
minority participation will be deductible if:

- the company in which a minority participation is acquired is a
resident of the Netherlands and conducts business activities in the
Netherlands. This includes Netherlands resident subsidiaries, in which
that company has an interest of at least 25 per cent;

- the business activities conducted in the Netherlands are material in
relation to the whole of business activities conducted by the concern
of which the Netherlands companies are a part;

- the acquiring company, together with related companies, does not own
a controlling interest (25 per cent or more) in the participation.

The meaning of "material" is undefined since, depending on the specific
circumstances of a case, different factors may be decisive with regard
to the question whether the business activities have a sufficient
relation with the Netherlands. However, the Undersecretary did indicate
that, although no fixed percentage can be assumed, 5 or 10 per cent may
be considered material.

Given the important role of the participation exemption the letter has
important practical implications. Unfortunately, since the "material"
criterion is not explained in detail, it is not quite certain what the
exact range of approval is.

NETHERLANDS: CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE

Until January 1, 1996, Netherlands corporate income tax was levied at
40 per cent on profits up to Dfl 100,000, and 35 per cent on the
excess. The 40 per cent rate will be gradually reduced. In 1996, it
will be 37 per cent, in 1997, 36 per cent and in 1998, it will be 35
per cent.

Thus from 1998, corporate income tax will be levied at 35 per cent
rate.

POLAND: PERSONAL TAXATION

The Polish Constitutional Tribunal ruled on December 28, 1995 that the
tax amendments to the Personal Taxation Law introducing six tax bands
for the 1996 taxation year (see FTWTR December 1995, page 229) were
unconstitutional as they did not provide the required vacatio legis.
Hence, the tax rates will remain for the 1996 taxation year as follows:

Personal Tax Scale for 1996
Annual taxable income in PLN
Over             Up to           Rate(%)

UNITED KINGDOM: PENSION SCHEMES - INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS

The Inland Revenue have issued a revised practice note relating to
pension schemes in the international context.

The circumstances in which employees overseas can remain members of a
UK approved pension scheme have been amended. The results are more
favourable and represent several relaxations. In particular,
individuals can remain overseas for periods of up to 10 years or longer
with agreement. They need not be under the control of the UK employer
and may also apply where the initial employment is with the UK branch
of a non-resident employer.

It is also intended that the requirement that the employee must have
initially worked in the UK be relaxed on an experimental basis.

Overseas pension technical changes have been made in relation to the
circumstances in which an employee from overseas can obtain
corresponding relief for UK tax purposes in respect of membership of a
foreign pension scheme.

In particular, the recognition of foreign schemes as corresponding to
UK arrangements for multi-national groups in tax havens are limited to
circumstances where it is legally impossible to establish a scheme for
the foreign emoluments employee in the jurisdiction of location or
where it is a scheme for a multi-national group to which all expatriate
(or at least the career expatriate) employees belong.

Individuals who are granted corresponding relief under the previous
practice will not be subject to the new practice on any future claim to
relief in respect of the same scheme.

UK/Ireland

The statement notes that the reciprocal approval agreement between the
UK and Ireland has been discontinued although relief may be available
pursuant to the protocol to the tax treaty between the two countries.

UNITED KINGDOM: COMPANY RESIDENCE

The Special Commissioners have recently considered the residence of two
offshore companies in the case of Untelrab Limited and Others v
McGregor. The principle that a non-UK incorporated company is resident
where its central management and control is exercised is based on a
handful of decisions the most recent of which is nearly 40 years old
and the majority of which are over 80 years old.

The two companies in question were subsidiaries of a UK resident parent
company. One was formed for the purpose of receiving the purchase price
when the UK parent purchased a company and assumed its debts.

Two of the directors were resident in Bermuda and were executives in a
company which managed the day-to-day affairs of the offshore company. A
third was a Jersey resident solicitor. Board meetings were held two or
three times a year in Bermuda attended by the two Bermuda directors. No
advance notice of board meetings was given and no agenda was circulated
although the Jersey director was kept informed of what was decided.

The company's business was the making of loans to other members of the
parent company's group at the request of the parent company.

The second company remained dormant for some five years and thereafter
participated in the financial dealings of the first. It was managed by
accountants in Guernsey. Two of the directors were residents of Sark
where the board meetings were held.

The Inland Revenue argued that the boards of both subsidiaries merely
rubber stamped decisions which had been made by the parent and had not
addressed their minds as to what they were being asked to do. They did
not really make decisions. While documentation was made in Bermuda the
decisions were taken in London.

They also argued that if, on the facts, a local board submitted to
direction from outside then that was central management and controlled
from outside. It was insufficient to go through the forms of corporate
governing where in fact decisions purportedly taken by a subsidiaries
board were taken at the direction of a parent. They argued that it
could not sensibly be said that the boards were making the decisions
and that in reality they were taken by the parent.

The Commissioners identified the following principles based on existing
cases:

- The Company was resident where the directors met and transacted their
business and exercised the powers conferred upon them;

- If the directors met in two places the Company's business was where
its real business was carried on and the real business was carried on
where the central management and control actually abided;

- A determination as to whether a case fell within that rule was purely
a question of fact to be determined by a scrutiny of the course of
business and trading;

- The actual management and not the place where a company ought to be
managed determined its residence;

- It was an exceptional case for a parent company to exert control for
its subsidiaries as a parent usually operated through the boards of its
subsidiaries;

- Although a board might do what it was told to it did not follow that
the control and management of the company lay with another so long as
the board exercised their discretion when coming to decisions and would
have refused to carry out an improper or unwise transaction; and

- When deciding the issue one should stand back from the detail and
consider the picture which the whole of the evidence presented.

On these principles the Commissioners found that although the
subsidiaries were complacent to do the will of the parent they did
actually function in giving effect to the parents' wishes. Proposals
were discussed at board meetings and decisions were made by the
directors in the best interests of the Company. They would have refused
to carry out any proposal which was improper or unreasonable. The
parent did not control the board in the exercise of their powers. It
could have taken steps to remove the directors but could not control
them in their conduct of the business. The companies were therefore
resident in Bermuda and Sark respectively.

UNITED KINGDOM: WITHHOLDING TAX RATES

The Inland Revenue has issued a press release to clarify the rates of
tax withheld at source following the budget of November 29, 1995. The
basic rate of income tax was reduced from 25 to 24 per cent. Generally,
withholding has been at the basic rate. However certain rates of tax on
passive income have also been reduced to 20 per cent. As a result the
principal withholding tax rates from April 6, 1996 will be as in the
table below.

20% rate

Payment

- Interest paid by banks, building societies and other deposit-takers

- Interest on UK Government and other securities

- Interest distributions by authorised unit trusts

- Other annual interest payable under deduction of tax

- Purchased life annuities (income element)

- Certain payments made by paying and collecting agents

24% rate

- Annual payments (including charges on income, such as payments under
deeds of covenant to charities, and distributions by unauthorised unit
trusts)

- Other annuities (where PAYE does not apply)

- Rents paid to non-resident landlords

- Patent royalties

- Payments to foreign entertainers and sportsmen (subject to any
application for a reduced tax payments)

Income treated as paid under deduction of tax

Certain income is treated as though tax has been deducted from it but
the tax is not repayable. From April 6, 1996 tax will be treated as
deducted or paid at the following rates:

20% rate

- Foreign income dividends

- Stock dividends

- Loans to participators which are waived

24% rate

- Certain chargeable event gains.

UNITED STATES: BUDGET BATTLE CONTINUES

The philosophical differences between the Administration and the
majority Republicans in the House and Senate continue. In December, the
President vetoed the balanced budget bill passed by both Houses of
Congress. The bill contained major tax reform proposals. Subsequently,
the Administration offered its seven year balanced budget proposal,
relying on significant tax increases to offset middle class tax relief.

Included among the revenue raisers are the Administration's
expatriation tax as modified by the Senate (all gains of expatriates
would be taxed upon expatriation, rather than the proposal adopted by
Congress involving a 10 year extension of US tax jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of US assets), and the foreign grantor trust
proposals. Other revenue raisers in the Administration's plan include:

- A reduction in the dividends received deduction available to
corporations, from 70 per cent to 50 per cent thereby increasing tax on
intercompany dividends from a maximum rate of 10.5 per cent to a
maximum rate of 17.5 per cent.

- Treatment of preferred stock as boot in corporate organizations and
reorganizations, forcing recognition of gain on the receipt of
preferred shares as consideration for the transfer of property.
Conditions similar to those that appear in the anti-conduit regulations
would have to be met for the provision to apply. Those conditions
establish a standard under which an equity transaction has
characteristics of debt.

-  The conversion of a C Corporation to S Corporation status would be a
taxable event for any corporation that has a value in excess of US $5
million.

- Limiting replacement personal property received in like kind
exchanged to property located in the US.

-  Limiting the net operating loss carryback period to one year, but
extending the carryover period to 20 years.

- Creating a new class of Subpart F income for notional principal
contracts and including income from the lending of securities as
Subpart F income.

- Treating certain corporate redemptions that would be afforded
favourable dividend treatment in the hands of a corporation under
existing law as capital gain transactions. For a corporation, capital
gains are subject to higher tax rates than intercompany dividends.

- Limiting interest expense deductions for corporations in connection
with the issuance of debt which (i) had a maturity in excess of 40
years or (ii) provides for the payment of interest in the form of
shares of the corporation.

In addition, the Administration proposes to loosen the rules applicable
to captive insurance companies so that premiums paid to captives will
be treated as insurance if more than 50 per cent of the captive's net
premium income relates to the insurance of risks of unrelated persons.
The Administration also proposes to modify the rules applicable to
domestic corporations operating in Puerto Rico and claiming benefits
under Code S936.

UNITED STATES: REGULATIONS FOR PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIPS

Ordinarily, a partnership is not considered to be a separate entity for
purposes of computing taxable income. Rather, under the aggregate
theory of partnerships, a partnership is treated as a flow through to
its partners, who are generally deemed to receive the income and incur
the expenses booked by the partnership. Nonetheless, in some
circumstances, a partnership may be treated by financial markets as the
equivalent of a publicly traded corporation.

In 1987, Code S7704 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted to provide
corporate treatment for publicly traded partnerships. This means that a
separate level of tax is due from the partnership and the partnership
loses its status as a pass-through to its partners. Existing entities
were given a 10 year carryover before the new rules were to become
effective.

Under the statute, a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if
interests in it are traded on an established securities market or are
readily tradeable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent
thereof. Final regulations have been adopted implementing the statute.

Under the final regulations, an established securities market includes
a national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the
Securities Exchange Act 1934 or a national securities exchange which is
regulated under the laws of its place or organization.

Partnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market or the
substantial equivalent. If, under all the facts and circumstances, the
partners are readily able to buy, sell or exchange their partnership
interests in a manner that is comparable economically, to trading on an
established securities market.

The regulations contain a number of safe harbour exceptions. Under the
first safe harbour, certain transactions are expressly disregarded in
determining whether partnership interests are readily tradeable on a
secondary market. These transactions include traders in which carryover
basis exists, either from a transferor of the partnership interest or
resulting from a distribution from a partnership, transfers at death,
transfers among family members, the issuance of partnership interests
in exchange for cash, property or services, distributions from a
qualified retirement plan or by an individual retirement account.

Second, a transfer that is pursuant to a redemption agreement not
otherwise described above will be disregarded in determining whether
partnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market or
the substantial equivalent thereof if certain conditions are in place
to prevent the redemption and a potential issuance of a comparable
interest in a transaction that follows closely in time.

Under the third safe harbour, transfers effected through a qualified
matching service which match lists of intended sellers and potential
purchasers will be disregarded.

Finally, private placements are disregarded. To constitute a private
placement under the final regulations, all partnership interests must
have been issued in a transaction that was not required to be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the partnership must
not have more than 100 partners at any time during the tax year.

The final regulations provide rules of application for the foregoing
provisions. If a transaction does not fall within a specific safe
harbour, the transaction is not presumed to be a trade of a partnership
interest on an exchange or on a secondary market or the equivalent
thereof. Thus, no presumption arises as to the effect of the
transaction. Taxpayers are free to argue that the particular facts and
circumstances relating to a transfer of a partnership interest are not
sufficient to cause the interest from being sold on the substantial
equivalent of a secondary market. If the sum of the partnership capital
or profits interests transferred during the year, exclusive of
transactions covered by any of the safe harbours, does not exceed 2 per
cent of the total interests in partnership capital or profits, the
partnership is not a publicly traded partnership. Finally, if the
general partner and related entities own more than 10 per cent of the
capital or profits interests at any time during the year, all
percentage computations are to be made exclusive of the interests owned
by the general partners and related entities.

UNITED STATES: NEW SOURCE REGULATIONS PROPOSED

The source of income is an important concept under US tax law. For US
entities, the source rules control the computation of the foreign tax
credit limitation. For foreign entities, the source rule frequently is
crucial in determining whether the US has jurisdiction to tax. Code
S863(b) controls the source of income that arises when a company
engages in income producing activities in more than one location.

In December, the IRS proposed revised regulations under Code S863(b).

Under the proposal, taxpayers are to use the apportionment method to
determine the source of the income when inventory is manufactured in
one country and sold in another country. Under this method, 50 per cent
of the income is sourced in the place where the sale occurs and 50 per
cent is sourced in the place where the production assets are located.
The existing regulations are not limited to production assets and the
reference in the proposed regulations reflects a targeted approach to
the types of assets that are taken into account in the computation. A
production asset is any tangible or intangible asset owned by the
taxpayer and directly used to produce the inventory in issue. Excluded
are accounts receivable, marketing intangibles, transportation assets,
warehouses, the inventory itself, raw materials, work in process,
working capital, investment assets, prepaid expenses and stock of a
subsidiary.

If the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership which owns production
assets, a pro rata portion of those assets will be attributed to the
taxpayer from the partnership. If the taxpayer is a member of an
affiliated group within the meaning of Code S1504(a), the production
activity of the members of its group must be taken into account.

Tangible production assets are located where they are found and
intangible production assets are located where the associated tangible
assets are found.

As under the current regulations, an independent factory price may be
used to determine the source of income. It may only be elected if the
taxpayer regularly sells part of its output to wholly independent
distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to reasonably
reflect the income earned from production activity.

Also, a taxpayer may request advance permission to base its allocation
on its books and records. As part of its submission, the taxpayer must
show that the books and records are not affected by tax considerations.

Rules are also provided in the proposed regulations for transportation
income and for mineral extraction activities.

UNITED STATES: FINAL REGULATIONS FOR R & D EXPENSES

The IRS issued final regulations regarding the allocation and
apportionment of research & development ("R&D") expenses to various
classes of income. For US based taxpayers, the regulations will have
primary impact on the computation of the foreign tax credit limitation
and possibly the computation of combined taxable income for taxpayers
who export through foreign sales corporations or domestic international
sales corporations in order to obtain certain tax benefits.

The regulations finalise a proposal that was circulated for comment in
May 1995. The proposal provided relief to taxpayers in three broad
ways. It allowed taxpayers to allocate R&D expenses on the basis of a
three digit SIC code, rather than on the broader two digit code as
provided in existing law. The percentage of R&D expenses that may be
apportioned exclusively to US sources is 50 per cent if the sales
method of allocation is used.

This is an increase from 30 per cent under existing regulations. An
elective apportionment based on gross income is permitted, but once
elected may not be changed without the permission of the LRS.

The final regulations modify the proposed regulations in two broad
ways. First, taxpayers that elect the gross income method of
apportionment may make an exclusive apportionment of 25 per cent of the
R&D to the US. Under the proposed regulations, an exclusive
apportionment was allowed only if taxpayers elected the sales method of
apportionment. The IRS believes that this is an equivalent benefit to
the exclusive apportionment of 50 per cent under the sales method.

Second, the prior written consent of the IRS to change from the gross
income method to another method is no longer required once the taxpayer
has used the gross income method for 5 years.

The IRS and Treasury have advised tax practitioners that publication
date for the "check the box" regulatory proposal for classifying
entities will be delayed into 1996. A simplified system of classifying
international entities is apparently controversial within the IRS and
is holding up the project.

Regulation writers apparently view the proposal as unduly taxpayer
favourable and are opposed to granting taxpayers any leeway in
classifying foreign entities. The overall project may be severed into
domestic and international projects to break the log jam. It is also
reported that the status of one person entitles will not be addressed

In an attempt to raise tax revenue from persons other than local
voters, states have been attempting to collect income tax on pensions
payments and deferred compensation paid to persons who worked in the
state but who are no longer resident at the time of receipt.

Legislative language has been approved for a Federal bill that would
protect employees from tax in this situation. It is reported that the
proposal will cover non-qualified deferred compensation plans only when
the plan has a minimum 10 year payout or when the benefits are tied to
a qualified plan.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the holding of the

US F3d (2d Cit December 8, 1995, Docket No 95-4084), afig 104 TC 61
(1995). An express discharge of indebtedness must be present for the
deferral opportunity to exist. Where a foreign currency denominated
debt is merely satisfied with the agreed upon number of units of
foreign currency, no discharge exists.

HONG KONG: EXPENDITURE ON PRIVATE CARS

A Bill has been published to disallow deductions for all forms of
expenditure on private cars.

All outgoings and expenditure incurred in connection with the
acquisition, financing, leasing, maintenance, operation or use of a
private car (other than that incurred in respect of trading stock) is
to be disallowed as a deduction in the computation of assessable
profits for business profits tax.

All outgoings and expenditure incurred by employees on the acquisition,
financing, leasing, maintenance, operation or use of a private car is
to be disallowed as a deduction in the computation of assessable income
for salaries tax.

Private cars are to be specifically excluded from the definition of
machinery or plant for the purposes of initial and annual depreciation
allowances on capital expenditure.

The purpose of the proposed legislation is to discourage the use of
private cars which are causing serious traffic congestion and
pollution.

INDONESIA: TAX INCENTIVES PARTIALLY RESTORED

Following major amendments to Indonesia's principal tax laws in 1995
(see FTWTR February 1995 page 34 and March page 56) there have been
attempts to further restrict the already limited tax incentives
available in Indonesia. The official view is that the basic framework
of Indonesian tax law is structured to be internationally competitive
and thereby tax inducements should not be necessary to stimulate
particular sectors of the economy.

The top marginal rate of corporate and personal income tax had been
reduced from 35 per cent to 30 per cent. The Minister of Finance has
been granted authority to reduce the top rate to 25 per cent.

Remaining incentives included deferral of value added tax for approved
investment companies including foreign investment companies. Also the
corporate income tax and value added tax arising from contracts
financed by foreign grant or loan aid were borne by the government of
Indonesia under previous regulations. The Directorate General of Taxes
sought to discontinue deferral of value added tax under the provisions
of the amended Value Added Tax law. A Presidential Decree was published
in April whereby foreign aid financed contracts signed on or after
April 1, 1995 would be subject to tax.

Both changes were controversial and generated considerable discussion
and lobbying. Further changes have recently been announced which
partially reinstate the facilities. Deferral of value added tax has
been restored in respect of all investments which have been approved by
the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) but not later than March 31,
1996.

The related investments must be realised by December 31, 1999. This is
only a partial restoration of facilities for deferral of value added
tax but may enable those potential investors, which had made plans
assuming deferral of value added tax, to go ahead. The period of
realisation may, however, not be extended sufficiently for large
projects where delays are not uncommon. The imposition of VAT on new
investments of plant and equipment results in additional cash outflows
of 10 per cent during the investment period of a project. Although such
value added tax may be recovered, extended delays in refunds are not
uncommon.

Tax facilities for foreign aid contractors have been restored following
the publishing of Presidential Decree No 42/1995 dated November 30,
1995. The implementation is back dated to April 1, 1995 and thus
cancels Presidential Decree No 13/1995 which had withdrawn facilities.
The government of Indonesia will thus continue to bear the corporate
income tax and branch profits tax applicable to such contracts.
Facilities also extend to import duties, value added tax and sales tax
on luxury goods. Facilities only extend to the main contractor and not
its employees or subcontractors.

SOUTH KOREA: 1996 AMENDMENTS

Significant tax reforms have come into effect at the beginning of
January 1996.

Corporate Tax Rates
Taxable Income             1995     1996
up to W100 million         18%      16%
over W100 million          30%      28%

Inhabitant tax of 10 per cent (7.5 per cent in 1995) of corporate tax
should be also included. Agricultural and Fishery communities Special
Tax of 2 per cent on taxable income exceeding W500 million is no longer
applicable in 1996.

Tax Credits

Affiliated companies are those with equity ownership of 20 per cent or
more. The underlying tax on dividends from affiliated companies is
credited from fiscal year beginning January 1, 1996 as follows:

Tax                   Dividend amount
amount of       X     ------------------
affiliated            After tax earnings
company               of affiliated
                      company

Entertainment Expenses Limit

The limit has been changed to the total of W24,000,000 plus 1 per cent
of net worth up to W5 million plus a percentage of revenue on a sliding
scale as follows:

Sales                         %
below W10 billion           0.3
over W10 billion            0.2
over W100 billion           0.1

Accumulated Earnings Tax

Retained earnings appropriated as the reserve for development is
excluded from the tax base for accumulated earnings tax. The reserve
for development may be used to reduce deficits or transferred to
capital only.

Taxation on Capital Transactions

Stock dividends received as a result of the transfer of the capital
surplus including asset revaluation surplus to the capital were
previously taxed as deemed dividends.

After the tax revision, the dividends obtained through such transaction
are exempt from income taxes.

Transfer Pricing

As the tax disputes between nations are increasing, and to be in line
with the world trend, and to provide a legal basis for assessing taxes
on the international transactions between related parties, the Ministry
of Finance and Economy legislated the tax regulations on international
transfer pricing effective from January 1, 1996.

Arm's length price and methods to determine arm's length price such as
comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus
method, are described in detail.

Foreign corporations or non residents who have voting rights of 50 per
cent or more, directly or indirectly, and have the authority to make
decisions on the management of one company are classified as overseas
related parties. If the trades with such related parties are not
conducted at arm's length price, the transfer price can be adjusted.

The National Tax Administration can request information on
international transactions, such as basis of calculating transfer
price. Decree article 4.2 required disclosure of method and basis in
the final tax return starting the tax return for 1996. Taxpayers may be
penalised for failure to provide information in the amount of W30
million or less.

Thin Capitalisation

Interest paid on loans from a parent company or guaranteed by a parent
company in excess of 3 times the capital amount is deemed as dividend.
The ratio is 6:1 for financial institutions.

Controlled Foreign Corporations

Distributable earnings of affiliates located in tax havens are deemed
to be distributed to Korean corporate shareholders. An affiliate is one
where the shareholder has 20 per cent or more of the equity. A tax
haven is a jurisdiction with a corporate tax rate below 15 per cent.

A resident who gifts assets located abroad to a non resident is
required to pay gift tax thereon in Korea.

The procedures for mutual agreement to settle tax disputes between tax
authorities have been clearly defined.

AUSTRALIA: INTEREST WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION

The Government has announced that a number of significant changes will
be made to the exemption from withholding tax applicable to some types
of interest paid to foreign lenders. The changes are designed to
enhance Australian borrowers' access to overseas capital markets.
Interest paid to foreign lenders that does not qualify for the
exemption is subject to a 10 per cent interest withholding tax.

The current interest withholding tax exemption has four features:

- interest must be paid by an Australian corporation to foreign
lenders,

- borrowings must be by way of widely held debentures issued by an
Australian borrower,

- the borrowed funds must be used for business purposes, and

- the borrower must obtain an exemption certificate from the
Commissioner of Taxation prior to the payment of interest.

Changes to the exemption will eliminate the need for taxpayers to
obtain an exemption certificate and will modify other requirements of
the present law. Thus, in line with Australia's new self-assessment
system, it will be the responsibility of Australian borrowers to
ascertain whether the interest qualifies for an exemption from the
interest withholding tax.

Importantly, the requirement that borrowed funds must be used in an
Australian business will be removed, so the withholding tax exemption
will be available where borrowed funds are used to finance housing and
consumer loans.

The wide distribution of debentures requirement will be replaced by a
"public offer" test. To satisfy the public offer test, funds must be
raised by the issue of securities to unrelated foreign lenders by a
company resident in Australia. It will no longer be necessary to meet
the stricter "widely-held" test formerly used.

To protect the integrity of the interest withholding tax where no
exemption applies, borrowers who fail to deduct interest withholding
tax from non-exempt interest payments will be denied a deduction for
the interest payments.

The new interest withholding tax exemption rules apply from January 1,
1996.

AUSTRALIA: OFFSHORE BANKING UNITS

The Government is modifying the Offshore Banking Units regime to
provide Australian-based offshore banking units with greater
flexibility. An offshore banking unit is a banking entity located in
Australia that borrows and re-lends funds offshore. Interest payments
by offshore banking units are exempt from interest withholding tax.

To ensure the operations of offshore banking units were completely
insulated from Australian banking businesses, the original offshore
banking units exemption imposed strict quarantine rules on the units,
including prohibitions on Australian investments.

Offshore banking units that undertake fund management activities have
argued that the prohibition prevents them from offering clients
balanced global portfolios, which normally would contain some
Australian assets. The government has responded to the criticism by
announcing that offshore banking units that undertake fund management
activities will be able to invest up to 10 per cent of the value of
total funds under management in Australian assets.

AUSTRALIA: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONCESSION

The government has announced changes to the research and development
(R&D) tax concession, which provides a 150 per cent deduction for
eligible R&D expenditures, to combat 'gravedigging' practices designed
to exploit the concession.

The 'gravedigging' practice involves consultants examining company
records for previous years' expenditures that might qualify for the
special deduction and applying long after the fact for recognition of
expenses as R&D outlays.

Under the new rules, registration for the concession must take place
within six months of the end of the year in which the expenses were
incurred. Transitional arrangements will allow registration of expenses
incurred in the 1993-94 tax year and the 1994-95 tax year (ending 30
June 1995) until 30 June 1996. Expenses incurred prior to 1 July 1993
will no longer be eligible for the concession.

AUSTRALIA: ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION RESTRICTED

The apparent scope of Australia's general anti-avoidance provision has
been substantially narrowed following the decision of the Full Federal
Court in Spotless Services Limited & Anor 95 ATC 4775.

The taxpayer in the Spotless case had $40 million dollars invested on
the overnight money market and was seeking alternative longer-term, tax
effective investments. After discussions with various merchant banks it
settled on a scheme that involved the transfer of funds through a
series of bank transfers from Melbourne to the Cook Islands, where the
funds were eventually deposited.

Interest paid on the deposit was subject to Cook Islands withholding
tax of 5 per cent. The taxpayer then claimed the interest was exempt
from Australian tax pursuant to a provision that formerly exempted from
Australian tax income subject to foreign tax in its country of source.

The Commissioner attacked the arrangement, arguing the true source of
the income was Australia, where the scheme was devised and the money
originally deposited, not the Cook Islands, where it was finally
deposited. The Commissioner argued in the alternative that the
arrangements should be struck down on the basis of the general anti-
avoidance provision in the income tax legislation.

The Federal Court rejected the first argument, finding that the source
of the interest income was the Cook Islands because the taxpayer
completed the deposit contract in the Cook Islands, and ignoring the
earlier steps in the scheme.

The Court agreed that several of the elements required for the
operation of the general anti-avoidance provision were satisfied, but
concluded that the principal element required by the provision, that
the scheme be one of the dominant purpose of which was to obtain a tax
benefit, had not been satisfied. The dominant purpose of the scheme,
the Court said, was a commercial one, to obtain the maximum return on
the money investment after the payment of all applicable costs,
including tax.

The effect of the decision is to revive the "choice" doctrine used by
courts to decimate a predecessor general anti-avoidance provision.
Under the choice doctrine, the general anti-avoidance provision had no
application if the taxpayer were faced with two commercial choices and
chose the option that attracted the lower tax liability.

If the decision is not reversed by the High Court, legislative
amendment of the anti-avoidance provision is likely. In the meantime,
the scope of the anti-avoidance measure is severely constrained.

AUSTRALIA: GOODWILL

The Australian Taxation Office has recently lost two important cases on
the meaning of goodwill for tax purposes. The decisions open the door
to considerable tax benefits for many owners of small businesses.

The meaning of goodwill is relevant to a capital gains tax concession
that exempts from taxation 50 per cent of the gain realised on the sale
of a small business (with a net value of less than $2 million) that is
attributable to the sale of goodwill associated with the business.

In the first case, Case 59/95, the taxpayer sold a taxi business,
including the car, equipment, shares in a cab co-operative, and taxi
licence and attributed the amount of consideration received in respect
of the taxi licence (calculated as the excess of consideration received
over the market value of the car, equipment, and shares) as payment for
"goodwill" and thus eligible for the 50 per cent exemption.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal agreed with the taxpayer's
characterisation, concluding that the value of the licence was in its
power to confer monopoly privileges to the holder and in the context of
a taxi business, these privileges amounted to the goodwill of the
business.

In the second case, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Krakos
Investments (not yet reported), the taxpayer sold a hotel and pub
business and leased the business premises to the new owners. The
Commissioner of Taxation characterised the significant payment received
by the vendor as a lease premium, reflecting the location value to the
business, while the taxpayer claimed the payment was consideration for
the sale of business goodwill.

The full Federal Court agreed with the taxpayer's characterisation. The
decision is likely to have a major impact on the tax consequences of
sales of small businesses, as it makes it very difficult for the
Commissioner to carve out part of the sale price and attribute it to
factors apart from general goodwill.

NEW ZEALAND: DEDUCTIONS FOR WARRANTY CLAIMS

In CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has allowed a deduction for
expected warranty claims. Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited
("Mitsubishi") sold vehicles to dealers for on-sale and indemnified
those dealers for a warranty provided on sale against defects in
material or workmanship appearing within one year or 20,000 kilometres,
whichever occurred earlier. Evidence was given in the High Court that
in 1988 63 per cent of vehicles sold gave rise to a subsequent warranty
claim for which Mitsubishi indemnified the relevant dealers.

Mitsubishi deducted the estimated warranty costs for tax purposes in
the year in which the vehicles were sold. The Commissioner subsequently
disallowed the deduction. The case was argued on different bases:

- Whether the estimated warranty expense was properly deductible as
being "incurred" under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("Act")
in the year of sale of the vehicle;

- Whether, if no deduction was available under section 104, the
estimated warranty costs nevertheless reduced the assessable income
properly derived in the year of sale, ie the purchase price was not
fully earned until the warranty period expired (at the latest, one year
later); or,

Whether the warranty income should be spread under the accruals rules
contained in sections 64B to 64M of the Act.

The High Court held that a deduction was properly allowable under
section 104. The Court of Appeal held that a deduction was not
allowable under section 104 because the estimated warranty expense was
not incurred. However, the Court held that to the extent that the price
for the vehicle included an amount for the warranty, that amount was
not derived in the year of sale but should be spread over the period of
the warranty under ordinary principles. The Court of Appeal also held
that the accrual rules did not apply to the particular contact. The
Privy Council disagreed with the Court of Appeal and held that a
deduction was properly allowable under section 104.

Their Lordships considered the terms of the warranty to determine
whether Mitsubishi became "definitely committed" to the estimated
expenditure in the year of sale of each vehicle. They agreed with the
Court of Appeal that the effect of the warranty was not a promise that
the vehicle was free from defects on sale. They held that any liability
was contingent on a defect appearing and notification being made within
the warranty period and until that occurred, no liability was incurred.

Nevertheless, although that conclusion on the scope of the warranty
resulted in the Court of Appeal finding that the ability to deduct was
deferred to a later income year, that was not the end of the matter for
their Lordships.

They were not prepared to determine deductibility by rather arcane
legal distinctions between contingency and defeasibility as had been
done in earlier cases and by the Court of Appeal. The question was
whether with all the surrounding circumstances a legal obligation in
the future can be said to have accrued. In making that determination
theoretical contingencies were disregarded. Given the data available,
their Lordships held that the defects were a matter of existing fact,
not future contingency, as 63 per cent of the vehicles sold were found
to display defects within the warranty period. Those defects must have
existed at the time of sale.

The contingency that owners might choose not to seek repairs was likely
to be quite small and would not make a material difference to the
accuracy of the estimated expenditure. Accordingly, their Lordships
held that the warranty costs were deductible in the year of sale under
section 104 of the Act.

The finding on deductibility made it unnecessary for their Lordships to
reach a view on either of the other issues. However, they did comment
in relation to the second issue that, because Mitsubishi had not made a
separate charge for the warranty, in their view there was no
justification for treating part of the price of the vehicle as if it
were a separate charge for the warranty. They indicated that in their
opinion the full price should have been recognised as income and there
could be no deferral of income for the warranty costs.

They would not have been prepared, if a deduction was not allowable, to
"manipulate" the ordinary rules for the recognition of income to give
such a deferral.

The decision of the Privy Council does seem to have changed the test
for determining when expenditure is incurred for the purpose of being
deductible under the Act. For the reasons set out below, however, this
change may not have much practical significance.

SPAIN/PORTUGAL TAX TREATY

The ratification of the Spain/Portugal income tax treaty signed in
Madrid on October 26, 1993, was published in the Spanish Official State
Bulletin on November 7, 1995. It replaces one since 1968 and addresses
the problems arising from the new financial relationship between the
two countries.

Section 10 of the new treaty retains the right to tax dividends in the
payers's country. The rate of tax may not exceed 10 per cent if the
recipient holds 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of the
paying company directly.

Income from Government Stock may be taxed in both states.

Interest may be taxed in the contracting state of origin at a rate not
exceeding 15 per cent.

Capital Gains

While the 1968 agreement permitted the country of residence only to tax
capital gains, the new agreement provides that gains may be subject to
tax in the state where the company, whose shares have been sold, is
resident if the vendor has, either directly or indirectly, held at
least 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of the said company
for the previous twelve months.

Companies, whose assets consist of land and buildings, may be liable
for tax in the country in which the lands and buildings are located.

Limitation of Benefits

No reductions in or exemptions from the taxation of dividends, capital
gains, royalties or interest shall apply in the case of companies
engaged in the management of securities or other assets if more than 50
per cent of the authorised capital is held by shareholders who are not
resident in the state where the company in question is domiciled. This
is to prevent the carrying out of circular investment operations.

INDIA/MALTA TAX TREATY

India notified an income tax treaty with Malta, on November 23, 1995.
The treaty covers income tax and surcharge in India, and income tax in
Malta. However, the income tax on petroleum produced in Malta, is not
covered.

Business profits would be taxable in the source country, if the
enterprise carries on business through the permanent establishment
(PE), therein. However, profits, directly or indirectly attributable to
the PE, will only be taxable if the PE takes an active part in
negotiating, concluding or fulfilling contracts entered into by the
enterprise. Attribution will be to the extent of the contribution of
the PE in those transactions. The PE provision is not applicable to
insurance profits.

The term PE, among other fixed places of businesses, includes an
offshore drilling site. A building site or construction or assembly
project or connected supervisory activities is a PE, if it lasts for
more than 6 months. Certain activities are deemed a PE. Exploration of
the seabed, and its sub-soil or exploration of natural resources
situated there as well as activities, which are complimentary or
auxiliary to such activities. Also included is the use or installation
of substantial equipment or connected supervisory activities.

Dividends, interest, royalties and fees for services, and technical
service fees, are taxable in both the states. Tax in the source state,
may not exceed on dividends in India, 15 per cent, reduced to 10 per
cent, in the hands of a 25 per cent participating company. In Malta,
the tax may not exceed that chargeable on the profits out of which the
dividends are paid. On interest the maximum rate is 10 per cent.

Technical fees and royalties are taxable at 10 and 15 per cent
respectively. Total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or
supply of the specified property or right is also be covered by the
term 'royalties'.

Capital gains on the alienation of shares is generally taxable in the
state of residence of the alienator.

Double taxation is be avoided by the credit method. Tax sparing is
allowed for. Exempt income is taken into account for rate purposes.

US TREATY UPDATE

Kazakstan

Ratification of a negotiated income tax treaty with Kazakstan has been
delayed because of provisions in Kazak law permitting the use of
anonymous bank accounts and protecting investor secrecy. It has been
reported that a procedure will be adopted by the Kazak government that
will allow foreign governments to have access to anonymous accounts.

Netherlands Antilles

The protocol terminating the exemption for interest income that appears
in Article VIII, the sole remaining provision of the income tax treaty
between the US and the Netherlands Antilles, for most taxpayers was
submitted to the Senate for its approval. The protocol will allow
Article VIII to continue in existence for debt paid to finance
subsidiaries in connection with Eurobond offerings issued and
outstanding on or before October 15, 1984.

Switzerland

Negotiations regarding the open issues between the US and Swiss
governments are scheduled for early January. Not surprisingly, the
limitation on benefits provision which the US demands as part of its
treaty programme is a sticking point.

Ireland

Negotiations between delegations from the Republic of Ireland and the
US were held in December and apparently significant progress was made
regarding outstanding issues. As in the negotiations with Switzerland,
the limitation on benefits article is the principal sticking point.

France

Instruments of ratification of the new income tax treaty were exchanged
on December 30, 1995, causing the new treaty to be effective as of
January 1, 1996.

INTERNATIONAL TAX BOOKS

The Taxation of International Entertainers And Athletes

by Daniel Sandler.

The Chartered Institute of Taxation, Kluwer Law International;
Hardcover, 356 pages

Why are entertainers and athletes singled out for special tax
treatment? In his introduction the author notes that they are probably
the most mobile individuals in the business world. As they become more
well known income may be derived in many different countries and
residential ties to a particular country may lessen. Taxation of such
individuals in a source country may be problematic given the short stay
and the lack of any strong economic ties with that country.

The author also refers to concerns expressed in the 1987 OECD study on
taxation of the entertainment business that imply that entertainers
either evade tax or at best negligently prepare their returns.
Certainly he notes that perceived abuses by such individuals are better
reported than abuses by other taxpayers who do not enjoy celebrity
status.

The central focus of this book is a comparative analysis of the tax
treatment of non-resident entertainers and athletes in seven countries
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States. The key themes are firstly the question of allocation of
income and secondly enforcement. Most countries adopt withholding
mechanisms. Given the complexity of the entertainment industry a number
of issues are involved depending on the nature of the source of income.
The clash between personal service income and a royalty income is
particularly difficult.

The analysis of each country proceeds through an examination of the
taxation of non-residence generally and the treatment of non-residents
employed or carrying on business in the particular country. It also
considers the treatment of royalties and the general withholding
arrangements, as well as those specifically applicable to entertainers
and athletes. In each case, the effect of tax treaties on domestic law
is considered, as well as the application of VAT.

The OECD study on the taxation of entertainers and athletes refers to
sophisticated tax avoidance and an industry increasingly categorised by
loosely connected chains of companies, partnerships and joint ventures.
However, the principal focus of planning and indeed, anti-avoidance
rules apart from withholding, analysed in the book revolves around the
use of loan-out and slave companies. In each jurisdiction, the
treatment of such entities is considered in detail.

A chapter is devoted to a detailed analysis of article 17 of the OECD
model convention. He covers the history and interpretation of the
article in great detail. It illustrates some of the anomalies in the
rule where although singers and actors are covered by the article their
entourage is not. Other closely related professions who are equally
mobile such as "super models" also appear to be excluded.

This is a thorough and detailed book. For example in considering
article 17 he analyses in some detail the concerns of each of the
countries considered in relation to their concerns on the application
of article 17 in the context of their domestic laws.

Many tax books today are padded out with appendices comprising
voluminous source material. This is certainly not the case here. The
tax treaties of all of the countries have been carefully researched and
the results are contained in tables identifying the date when the
treaty entered into force, articles analogous to article 17,
limitations on the application of the article within the treaty and
other relevant comments.

A further chapter is devoted to illustrating the rules by reference to
examples. They comprise a pop group on a world tour and a professional
athlete participating in a number of tournaments around the world.

This is not a book about tax planning. Indeed the concerns of the
author expressed in the conclusion are for effective and efficient
taxation of non-resident entertainers and athletes and the policy
issues relating to it. The bulk of the book covers income tax although
VAT is also considered.

It is a highly thoughtful, thoroughly researched and very readable
book. It is clearly a must read for anyone involved in this area. Its
only drawback is the absence of an index although the lengthy
bibliography is extremely useful.

DEAR SUBSCRIBER,

Don't be surprised if you walk into your phone closet and find it
empty. That big, bulky PBX may soon be replaced by a tiny PC
card.

A PC card now sold by NetPhone, Northboro, Mass., performs all
the standard functions of a PBX, including basic call switching,
executing hunt groups, call forwarding and conferencing, for
example.

The best thing about the NetPhone, however, is its price. The
card and its accompanying software only cost $4,295. That price
easily beats spending several hundred thousand dollars for a PBX,
says Dave Zweiban, telecom consultant at the International Group,
Los Angeles, Calif.

Here's how the NetPhone works: The Windows-based system operates
on a 486 PC that uses Novell Netware and acts as a server on a
LAN, says NetPhone spokesman Bob Fletcher. The card plugs into
the 16-bit ISA slot of the PC, and is connected to phone lines on
a punchdown block.

One card can only handle six trunks and 18 extensions, but six
cards can be installed on a single 486 PC, says Fletcher. Your
full capacity is 36 incoming trunks and 108 extensions -- enough
for a mid-sized site.

NetPhone also includes features that aren't standard on PBXs. A
voice mail system, an automatic attendant and a CTI program that
links Caller ID numbers to customer records are included in
NetPhone's software. And each PC on your LAN is loaded with
software that receives Caller ID from the PBX server and links it
to files, Fletcher says.

But is the PC card too good to be true? Many of the long-standing
PBX manufacturers think so. The majority of PC-card PBXs can't
handle digital lines, T1s or ISDN yet, says Tony Tissot, a
director of marketing at Rolm, San Jose, Calif. And, there is
little redundancy built into the cards, adds Tissot. In most
stand-alone PBXs, you can order back-up circuits for
mission-critical applications, he says.

Tissot is right on many counts. The NetPhone system, for example,
can only handle analog trunks and phones for now, and doesn't
support T1s, ISDN or frame relay. Plus, NetPhone doesn't have a
UPS (uninterruptable power supply) built into it. But, the
company does suggest putting at least a 30-minute UPS on your
server.

When power goes out completely, each card has an automatic "ring
down" feature, says Fletcher. That means each card has one
extension that works off the phone company's power, so you can
dial out, he adds. And, if your server gets locked up or fails,
but its power is still on, the PBX will function normally,
although voice mail and CTI will not run.

NetPhone is now working on T1 and ISDN capabilities for its
cards, and plans to have them ready by the end of '96, says
Fletcher. The company is also developing programming that will
let companies link PBX servers together and control them from a
central PC. That would eliminate one of the other current
advantages of PBXs, says Fletcher.

Ironically, Mitel doesn't think card-based PBXs are a bad idea.
The company is developing a PBX for release in 1996 that combines
PC cards and a LAN server, says Mitel marketing manager Rob
Clark. The cards plug into the back of a PC and will connect to
both digital lines and T1s, he adds. Up to 200 extensions can be
serviced by the PBX.

Manufacturing PC cards that switch calls isn't a big gamble,
Clark explains. "Companies will be pushed into using CTI as it
becomes more and more common in business, and customers will even
start requesting it," he says. "And CTI is very easily integrated
with LANs -- in some cases more so than with PBXs," Clark adds.

Note: if you buy an initial NetPhone card, the card's price is
reduced to $3,295 for additional cards. NetPhone's number is
(508) 393-7979.

MOTOROLA BEATS CELLULAR "PHREAKS"

Worried that hackers may run up big bucks on your company's
cellular phones? Motorola is taking a step that should prevent
hackers from using devices to intercept your phones' electronic
serial numbers and phone numbers.

The company is launching a new line of phones with a microchip
that encrypts each subscriber's phone number and serial number.
Encryption encodes the numbers with algorithms that can only be
decoded by a decryption key at cellular base stations.

Phreaks will still be able to intercept signals, but shouldn't be
able to crack encrypted codes without a decryption key.

USE YOUR ROOFTOP TO MAKE BIG BUCKS

Look up at the stars. Do you see dollar signs in the heavens? You
could if you look a little lower and rent out your rooftop for
wireless antennas.

Rooftop management companies desperately want rooftop space to
meet a rising demand for antenna locations from wireless
carriers. The telecom bill and the '96 auction of PCS licenses
will create an explosion in the number of rooftops needed for
cellular, microwave, PCS and paging antennas over the next three
years, says John Cipollone, vice president of Tower Economics
Company Inc., Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Tower Economics, a rooftop
management company, is now signing deals for rooftop space that
pay owners between $300 and $1,300 per month, adds Cipollone.

The best part of generating revenue with rooftop leases is that
registering with the management companies is free, says Jim
Innes, director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. The
companies put your buildings on their list of eligible sites and
do all of the marketing to wireless carriers, adds Innes. And the
rooftop companies get paid by earning a commission on the monthly
payments a carrier gives you, but only after a deal is signed,
explains Innes. You don't have to do any of the dirty work, like
conducting tests for interference or writing up contracts.

The Teachers College at Columbia University, New York City,
recently got a surprise when it was offered a deal for rooftop
space. The college was considering going with Local Area
Telecommunications (Locate), New York City, for local service
when Locate's technicians noticed one of the college's buildings
was ideal for a microwave antenna, says Tom Fiorella, a business
services analyst at the college.

Locate had rooftop management company AAT Communications Corp.,
Edison, N.J., contact the university and make an offer for space
on the 15-story building, says Fiorella. The offer was $4,800 per
year for 10 square feet of rooftop, he adds.

What type of buildings are needed? Virtually any height is used
by carriers, says Arne Jerfsten, manager of technical support at
Locate. Many small buildings are positioned on hills that provide
good locations for antennas, he adds. Plus, PCS antennas don't
have to be located high above the ground, says Cipollone.

Even if your company is located in a rural area, you should
register with a rooftop management company, says Jim Innes,
director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. Carriers
must reach rural areas if they want to stay competitive, Innes
explains. You can register with multiple management companies,
such as AAT at (908) 417-3993, Tower Economics at (610) 667-0351
and Apex at (215) 875-0791.

5 TIPS FOR GENERATING ROOFTOP DOLLARS

Here are five tips from rooftop management professionals on how
to take advantage of the upcoming need for space:

1. Make sure the carrier that wants to use your rooftop does an
interference study before its equipment is installed. Carriers
are required to do so by FCC rules that say the integrity of the
surrounding area and its telecom equipment must be preserved,
says Jerfsten.

2. Get a copy of the local zoning laws by contacting the city or
county your building is located in. Some areas prohibit buildings
from reaching certain heights.

3. Make sure the rooftop company considers your building's
structure, says Innes. When dishes grow larger than two feet
across, some walls have to be reinforced. Structural alterations
usually bring an increase in the monthly revenue you can make,
however.

4. If you want negotiations with a carrier to be as little of a
burden as possible for your company, have a rooftop management
company handle them, says Columbia University's Fiorella. But,
you may be able to get more money if you handle the deal
yourself, he adds.

5. Don't hold out on a deal for long periods of time for extra
money. Carriers need space so quickly that they will make an
offer to another company while you are waiting, says Cipollone.

A LOCAL SERVICE REFUND FROM THE BELLS?

MCI has petitioned the FCC to require the Baby Bells to return
millions of dollars in lobbying expenses that were unlawfully
billed to customers. So, you may soon get a boost for your
budget.

The FCC found the Bells improperly charged ratepayers $116.5
million from 1988-1991 for lobbying in a recent audit. But,
instead of requiring the RBOCs to give back the money to
customers, the FCC only slashed the price cap on future Bell
access charges by $5 million, MCI claims.

The FCC found BellSouth passed on $27 million in expenses, Bell
Atlantic $21.5 million, Ameritech $18 million, Southwestern Bell
and Nynex $14 million each, PacTel $12 million and U S West $10
million.

NEW FAX SERVICES MAKE YOU AN OFFICE HERO

Read this and your staff may erect a statue of you. That's
because you can save them loads of word processing by converting
faxes into files that can be read by WordPerfect, Microsoft Word
and Excel before they reach the office.

Educational Testing Services (ETS) in Princeton, N.J., has saved
money on data processing by using a fax-conversion service from
Global Fax, Warren, Mich. Incoming faxes are changed into a
language compatible with ETS's IBM mainframes, says Frank
McKeown, principle systems engineer at ETS.

Global Fax is processing the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
registration form for ETS, says McKeown. The forms are
standardized and have fill-in circles and blanks for hand-written
answers, he adds.

And when they are faxed to ETS's 800 number, they are routed to
Global Fax by AT&T, says Paul Kennedy, vice president at Global
Fax. Our company then changes the faxes into two seperate file
formats for the educational testing company, he adds.

Besides the mainframe files, ETS is having Global Fax make TIFF
(Tagged Image File Format) files from the original faxes so ETS
can load them into Hijack fax software for viewing, adds McKeown.
ETS has always had a company policy of keeping original copies of
registration forms in case questions from students arise later,
says McKeown.

Global Fax emphasizes that faxes can be converted into almost any
language, including ASCII and DOS Text. Companies use the service
to drop faxed product orders and invoices straight into
accounting software, for example, says Kennedy.

ETS can't pinpoint exactly how much money it has saved, but under
its pilot program, it has received 2,000 two-page faxes in the
past two months. Paying employees to enter the data from the
forms into ETS's computer system would have been much more than
it cost for Global Fax to convert them in a few hours, says
McKeown.

Global Fax says that in general, fax-to-data conversion costs
between $1.00 and $3.00 per fax. The price depends on the length
of the fax, the number of data fields involved, how much
conversion from hand-written copy is needed and the amount of
accuracy desired. Global Fax offers from 95% to 99.9% accuracy.

But McKeown says to shop around. He went with Global Fax because
the company gave him the best offer out of three companies he
requested proposals from. You can get a list of fax-to-data
companies by calling your 800 carrier. Global Fax's number is
(800) 887-4329.

5 TIPS ON STARTING A FAX-TO-DATA PROGRAM

Here are five more tips from McKeown on how to begin a
fax-to-data program that will save you bucks:

1. Prevent customers from sending extra faxes on your 800 lines
by having them include their credit card numbers on faxes. Give
customers a warning that if more than one fax is sent with their
credit card number, they will be charged for the extra faxes.

2. Make sure your fax-to-data service provider notifies you of
the number of faxes that come out garbled. If the number gets too
high, you should discontinue the service.

3. Market the fax service as a convenient tool for customers.
After all, they don't have to pay for postage or a phone call to
make orders.

4. Use caution because some fax-to-data companies have you dial
into one of their databases to retrieve faxes. If that's the
case, make sure you have a service with enough bandwidth that
downloading image files doesn't tie up your lines for hours.

5. Find out if the fax-to-data company you are considering has an
archiving service. Global Fax will back up faxes at its
facilities for a period from days to weeks after they are
received for a reasonable fee, says McKeown.

PC CARD LIFTS YOU TO FRAME RELAY CLOUDS FOR LESS

You could lay $2,000 on the table to buy a frame relay router
that will link your LAN to a carrier's frame relay cloud.

But, you'd be paying too much. You can purchase a new PC card
from Motorola that makes the connection for only $999.

The card is called the Vanguard 100 PC. And, it lets you plug a
non-frame relay LAN router into it to send your LAN's traffic
onto a frame relay network. You don't have to pay for an
expensive upgrade of a current router or buy a new one to link to
frame relay, says Rod Wilson, a marketing director at Motorola,
Mansfield, Mass.

Another good use for the Vanguard 100: At remote sites where you
don't need more than one connection to your company's frame relay
network. When the card is plugged into the back of a PC, its
digital service unit can have a phone line configured for frame
relay plugged into it.

And there is a bonus with the Vanguard 100. If you can only get
ISDN at a site, the card can be ordered with an ISDN network
termination device on it. But watch out! It only handles one B
and one D channel because it was designed primarily for frame
relay, says Wilson.

Motorola says it doesn't have any users of the card yet because
it's so new. It, in fact, is the first FRAD (frame relay access
device) on a PC card on the market.

But the Vanguard 100 should find users quickly because it is an
easy way for companies to link to frame relay networks, says Tim
Burke, independent telecom analyst at the Yankee Group, Boston,
Mass. At this point the technical know-how isn't always there at
telcos when it comes to helping companies link to frame relay, he
explains. But the Vanguard 100 makes the connection a simple
plug-and-play operation, adds Burke.

There is a disadvantage. The Vanguard 100 will only give you a
connection speed of 56 Kbps, says Wilson. This limits the card to
use primarily at sites that don't have long, constant hours of
frame relay usage, adds Burke. Motorola's number is (508)
261-1058.

NEW CTI SYSTEM SAVES $500,000 AT OCTEL

Does CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) work budget miracles?
Linking phones and computers saved Octel Network Services,
Carrollton, Tex., $500,000 in 1995.

Using a CTI system from Fort Worth-based Teknekron Infoswitch cut
the average time that agents spend on calls from 180 seconds to
150 seconds. The number of calls taken by reps per hour also
increased from 7.5 to 12, and the average wrap-up time for
finalizing post-call records decreased from 120 seconds to 45
seconds. And, since Octel's agents take calls on 800 numbers that
the company pays for, the savings added up, says Kevin McKinnon,
director of customer service at Octel.

Another bonus: Although Octel's incoming calls doubled in 1995,
the company only had to hire 50% more staff. In past years, Octel
doubled its staff when calls doubled, says McKinnon.

The Teknekron CTI system that Octel installed is called
Orchestra!, and it sits on a central server and individual
workstations like most CTI programs. But Octel posed a special
problem because its workstations don't have hard drives, so the
CTI program couldn't be loaded on them.

Teknekron had to load both parts of Orchestra! onto the LAN
server and have screen-pops delivered to workstations using their
addresses, says McKinnon. At first, packets were not exchanged
correctly and the timing of the screen-pops was off, he adds. But
Teknekron fixed the problem within a few days and the CTI program
has worked fine ever since, McKinnon says.

A program called Rendezvous! makes the connection between a
Teknekron Series III ACD on Octel's SRX PBX and Orchestra! on the
LAN server. Rendezvous! is loaded onto a Sun SPARCstation
minicomputer (the two are sold together) and collects call data
from a management port on the ACD. Calls are then routed based on
the number that the customer has dialed or the customer's Caller
ID, among many options.

You can also list the skills of each of your representatives on
Rendezvous!, and then rank your agents' abilities on each skill.
Calls can be routed to the best available agent based on their
ratings.

McKinnon says that the cost of the Teknekron CTI system is
reasonable, especially considering the savings it has already
generated for Octel. Installing the Series III ACD, Orchestra!,
Rendezvous!, a Sun SPARCstation and AutoQuality! (which records
calls so you can monitor agents) runs $2,500 to $5,000 per
workstation, says John Kaiser, managing director at Teknekron.
The system usually pays for itself within a year or two, he adds.

One problem: Orchestra! only works with AT&T, Nortel and
Teknekron PBXs. Teknekron Infoswitch's number is (817) 267-3025.

IN BRIEF . . .

-- AT&T has announced plans to cut 40,000 jobs over the next
three years as part of its restructuring effort. Roughly 70% of
those positions will be slashed by the end of 1996, and most cuts
will occur in the U.S. The company also will take a $4 billion
charge against its fourth-quarter earnings to cover expenses
associated with its three-way split.

-- The FCC has shut down again except for essential personnel.
But, this time "essential personnel" includes employees who are
collecting bids for the C block PCS license auctions scheduled to
be finished in '96. So far, the first round of bids has brought
offers of over $437 million.

-- American Mobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC) and Mitsubishi
Electronics America introduced the first transportable satellite
phone available for use in North America. The phone operates
anywhere in the world that AMSC's satellites cover, and retails
for just under $3,000. Usage charges run as low as $1.49/minute
for long distance.

THE WEEK'S BEST DEALS

1. AT&T is giving customers who order new CustomNet a one-time
interstate usage credit per main account. The credit equals the
usage charges of interstate calls billed during the first month
after enrollment. It won't be greater than $5,000, and will
appear on the second invoice. Eligible customers are: those who
switch lines from another IXC's switched access service; or
existing Commercial Long Distance, Small Business Option,
CustomNet, Pro WATS/Plan Q or Distributed Network customers who
order new CustomNet service.

2. Looking for good international long distance rates? Sprint is
offering new and existing Clarity Option A or B, or VPN Premiere
customers discounts on international use. Existing customers must
have less than three, six or nine months left on a one-, two-,
three-, four- or five-year term plan and sign a new contract of
equal or greater length. New customers are eligible on their
first term plan. A 10% discount will be applied to international
voice use from the U.S. to Belgium and South Africa, and 15% will
be knocked off calls to Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, Italy, India,
Peru, Russia, Spain and Venezuala. Customers get the price break
for 12 months or the entire length of the term plan, whichever is
longer.

Sincerely,

Reed Miller

AIN INDUSTRY ANTICIPATES GROWTH, OPEN SYSTEMS IN 1996

     If 1994 was a year of lab tests and technical development, and
1995 was the year AIN moved from the lab into field deployments, what
will we call 1996 a year from now?  According to many in the industry,
1996 is going to be the year AIN gets down to business.  Many carriers
now have enough services in the market to begin leveraging them and
benefitting from combined service offerings.  AIN services are
proliferating and submerging into the network to the extent that they
don't generate quite as much amazement as they used to.  
     There continues to be tremendous momentum in the AIN hardware
market, but the wireless market is beginning to overshadow the Bell
operating companies (BOCs) as a source of business according to some
vendors, who see the BOCs as reaching a "hardware plateau."  Some
industry observers believe that the solution to this problem, and the
way to create continued growth in the AIN market, is to develop open
systems.  There are forces within the industry trying to achieve this,
and outside forces are converging on the market.  There are signs
that, one way or another, 1996 will be the year AIN interoperability
finally happens for real.

  ...Getting the Flywheel Up to Speed

     On the service side, synergistic effects are beginning to appear
for carriers who plunged into AIN early.  A prime example is
BellSouth, although the carrier's lead in service deployment may be
narrowing as other BOCs increased their activities and began to catch
up in 1995.
     BellSouth's Executive Director for AIN Scott Schaefer describes
the company's AIN division as an accelerating engine, with the carrier
gaining expertise, and customers beginning to drive the process to a
greater degree.  "Because we've gotten the proliferation of AIN that
we had in 1994 and 1995, we're starting to get a lot stronger feedback
loop from the marketplace," said Schaefer.  "They've got their hands
on this stuff.  They're using it, and they're coming up with new ideas
and extensions for services that we haven't thought of before."
     Expect the geographic scope of AIN services to expand in 1996 as
well, meeting the demands of customers who want services to work the
same way no matter where they are.  The bugs will eventually get
worked out of interstate caller ID, and the recent agreement between
Ameritech and U S West to share calling name databases is a sign of
things to come.

  ...More Hardware Players

     The growth of the AIN market and the increasing opportunities for
developers from the mainstream computing market will mean more new
hardware products and new industry participants in 1996.  
     "I think more people are going to be drawn into being technology
suppliers in the AIN arena," said Schaefer, "and not just at the
Service Control Point or Service Node levels, but maybe in niches like
voice recognition as a specialty that they would integrate with a
larger platform or some other specialty function.  There's room in
there for niche players to come in and integrate their specialty
within the broader AIN platform."
     The result of these new competitors will be continuing gains in
price/performance.  Hardware and software prices dropped significantly
in 1995, and this trend will continue in 1996.  
     Chris Ebling, marketing program manager at Tandem Computers Inc.
, agrees that Tandem's prices have come down since the beginning of
1995, as have those of its competitors.
     "It's a little bit more difficult to talk about the cost for
switch-based [intelligent networking]," said Ebling.  "That tends to
be hidden a little bit more in the overall bids the switch vendors put
out, but I suspect that has come down as well.  I've heard that the
pricing of IN loads on switches has come down significantly this year,
and that was one of the larger barriers for some of the smaller
independents to getting in."

  ...No Cottage Industry Yet

     The part of the original AIN promise that has so far been almost
completely overlooked is the appearance of third party software
developers.  Despite some interest from potential developers and some
efforts from carriers to accommodate them, the anticipated industry of
independent AIN service builders has simply not appeared.
     Ebling sees this as a serious problem for intelligent networking. 
"If we don't figure out a way to get third party application providers
involved in this market, then intelligent networking will remain just
an infrastructure product and it will never really realize its full
potential."
     According to Ebling, the only way to create this market is
through true interoperability, at a level that still does not exist in
the AIN market.     "There is no common application environment that
you can develop applications to," said Ebling.  "Tandem has its own. 
Yeah, we publish it.  Big deal.  HP has its environment.  IBM has its
environment with Bell Atlantic.  So people are creating proprietary
open systems if you will.  Sure they're open, but they're proprietary
in terms of the API so that people who are developing service logic
are doing that only for one vendor's system.  There's no portability
between the systems.  There's no incentive for someone to get involved
in that market because they'd be developing for one particular
platform and it's a very high investment to develop these kinds of
applications."
     Ebling argues that this will eventually become a crippling
limitation for AIN if it isn't overcome.  "Until we can figure out a
way to provide a common application environment, I believe that AIN
will never be much more than what it is today," said Ebling.  "It will
certainly never reach its full potential."
     One force attempting to overcome this problem is the Intelligent
Network Forum, which is accepting charter members until Jan 31.  Nine
companies have so far made financial commitments to the Forum.  (For
more information on the Forum, contact John C. Nowell at 312/507-
8882.) 

  ...Advanced Intelligent Internet?

     One standard which is beginning to show its face in the
intelligent networking field is TCP/IP.  The Internet protocol is
attracting large numbers of developers precisely because it has become
the de facto standard for large- scale data networks.  From the
Internet, TCP/IP is beginning to invade the corporate LAN market and
other fields as well, including intelligent networking.
     At least one company, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories
Inc., is working on a way use TCP/IP to integrate CPE-based
intelligence with the SS7-based intelligence of the signaling network. 
According to Vice President of Network Applications Richard Pickering,
TCP/IP is bringing about "a total change in the way intelligent
networks can be designed.  There is a sea change.  SS7 has had the
last few years, and I think TCP/IP will have the next few years."
     Genesys' NetVectoring technology allows Internet platforms to
essentially send orders to the signaling network.  Genesys has
demonstrated an application that allows an Internet user to click a
button on a company's web page and generate a voice call through the
public network to the company's call center.  The Internet application
passes data on both ends of the desired connection to the SS7 network,
allowing it to set up the call.  During the call, the same application
would be able to tell the signaling network when more bandwidth was
needed, to add a video connection to the call for example.
     In this vision, the old argument about whether the intelligence
should be in the network or in the terminals is sidestepped. 
NetVectoring works by integrating intelligence in both locations.  "In
order to achieve [dynamic bandwidth control] you need the central
network intelligence to be able to collaborate with some intelligence
that's working within the application itself," said Pickering, "which
tends to be in the originator's point or the terminator's point." 

  ...A Voice Traffic Lane on the Superhighway

     The integration of "endpoint intelligence" into the intelligent
network can provide more elegant solutions to some problems than AIN
alone can offer.  For example, the ability to dynamically share the
bandwidth of a single connection among several devices has the
potential to reduce the need for individually numbered connections and
ease the number exhaust problem.  Such applications will distribute
call routing intelligence beyond the SS7 network, and require a fairly
close connection between the SS7 network and the Internet, as well as
other data networks.
     Although the process may not be complete by the end of 1996, it
is likely that the Internet will evolve into a kind of meta-network
running in parallel with other, more specialized networks, including
the SS7 signaling network and the circuit switched voice network. 
Both these networks will continue to play a role, since they are
optimized to perform critical communications functions, but their
ultimate position may be as specialized sections of a sophisticated
and highly intelligent multimedia network.

UNISYS AND BELLCORE TEAM TO OFFER NEW NETWORK MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES

     Unisys Corp. and Bellcore have formed a strategic alliance under
which they will integrate the NIRIS platform, a Unisys product used to
collect and examine SS7 network information, with Bellcore's NetMavin
link monitoring software.  The result will be a generic, network wide,
operations support system that promises to give carriers more control
than ever before over their SS7 network traffic.  Immediate
applications are expected in fraud prevention and traffic load
control, but the NIRIS/NetMavin combination will also allow new
applications in areas from billing to marketing.

  ...One More Network on the Top

     The alliance makes it possible to combine the local level
monitoring capability of the existing NIRIS platform with the high
level intelligence of NetMavin.  NIRIS platforms are already deployed
in some carriers' networks where they generally operate alongside a
Signal Transfer Point (STP).  Acting essentially as a packet sniffer,
the NIRIS platform reads all incoming SS7 traffic as it passes through
the STP link and collects it as necessary.
     "Through the basic component of the NIRIS platform, the data is
collected, filtered, and massaged to some degree and passed off to the
applicable application program that's looking for certain pieces of
information," explained Jerry Parker, director of sales for NIRIS at
Unisys.
     This capability is expanded to cover the entirety of the
carrier's infrastructure by networking these individual NIRIS units
together -- using a traditional wide area network -- and connecting
them to a central application server running NetMavin.  The combined
solution will allow carriers to search their networks for particular
kinds of messages and collect them at a single point to perform
analyses in near real time that can describe the status of the entire
network.

  ...Right, Now Pay Attention 007

     The NIRIS platforms do much more than passively absorb and
retransmit messages, however.  It would hardly be practical to
duplicate the entire traffic load of the SS7 signaling network and aim
it across a WAN at an application server.  Thus the NIRIS platforms
actively study the information they are receiving and only send
messages to the application server that are relevant to what it is
trying to do.  "The most effective place to collect [data] is near the
STP site," said Bellcore's Product Manager for NetMavin Mike Myers. 
"They usually have between 50 and 200 signaling links coming into a
certain STP, so you monitor the links there.  One of the tricks when
you're dealing with this massive amount of data is to effectively
manage it.  You only want to copy what we call 'interesting' or
'important' messages, and a message doesn't have to be copied multiple
times; it can be reused by each application as necessary."
     The benefits of this capability for carriers could be immense. 
"In a big network, it's not atypical for several hundred million
messages to be flowing every single day," said Myers.  "This is an
incredible source of data for a large service provider that is
presently untapped, so the joint solution is a unique way to get this
data and use it to the corporation's best advantage."
     One of the most obvious applications, and the one with the most
immediate impact on carrier bottom lines, is fraud prevention.  The
only other system capable of tracking calls across the entire network
is the billing system.  While the billing system might detect fraud
when it generates a massive monthly bill for a subscriber, the damage
is already done.
     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination will be able to pick out fraud as
it is happening.  One example that Myers cites is illegal call
resellers who operate in large metropolitan areas.  "They'll open up
an apartment or a storefront, and they'll advertise on the street that
you can call anywhere in the world for $10 an hour," Myers explained. 
"They'll have multiple lines in there, and they'll just pump calls 24
hours a day into the network.  Today's scenario is at the end of the
month, when the bills come in, the service provider realizes that this
person owes them a quarter of a million dollars.  Of course by the
time they send the bill to the customer, that person's long gone."
     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination would be able to detect the sudden
appearance of massive call volumes from a particular location, and
compare the traffic to specified criteria to decide if it should alert
a security agent.  

  ...Other Applications Await

     Fraud control is only one application area for the system, which
will serve as a generic support infrastructure.  It will also perform
tasks such as monitoring traffic for sudden surges and helping
reconstruct the conditions that created an outage so that similar
outages can be prevented in the future.  Even marketing applications
will be possible as carriers use the system to mine the tremendous
amount of data they already generate on millions of individual
transactions with customers.
     "What we're talking about today is really the first wave in using
that data effectively," said Myers, who described the philosophy of
the system as a "bit of a paradigm shift."  Instead of having the
telephone company buy "focused solutions" in which a single tool is
acquired to solve a single problem, the NIRIS/NetMavin combination
will offer a range of applications to be used by "wildly disparate
people within the telephone company.  This solution won't just solve
problems for one small part of the company," said Myers.  (Oliver
Picher, Unisys, 215/986-5367; Annie Lindstrom, Bellcore, 201/829-
4062.)

BELLCORE PURSUES INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS

     In addition to making partnerships within its traditional segment
of the industry, Bellcore is also furiously expanding into
international markets, as well as going outside the voice business
entirely.  In the last month, Bellcore has announced several key
partnerships and contracts:

*    A contract with Telkom South Africa under which Bellcore will
     provide intelligent networking consulting during 1996.  Telkom
     South Africa is currently implementing IN functionality in its
     network to serve corporate customers with such services as
     virtual private networks and toll-free calling.  Services are
     planned for deployment in 1996 and 1997.

*    A letter of intent to form a strategic alliance with the Ministry
     of Economic Affairs (MOEA) of Taiwan, Republic of China. 
     Bellcore will work with the MOEA on a series of cooperative
     development projects and jointly pursue business opportunities in
     the Asia-Pacific region.  Because of restrictions of the Modified
     Final Judgement (MFJ), Bellcore would work only on projects to be
     marketed outside the United States.

*    Separate Statements of Principle with Sun Microsystems and
     Netscape Communications Corp. under which Bellcore will combine
     its expertise with both companies in pursuit of opportunities in
     the Internet marketplace.  Bellcore plans to become a member of
     Sun's Independent Software Vendor Program and will provide
     systems integration consulting based on Netscape's Internet
     software.

BELLSOUTH ASKS FCC FOR PERMISSION TO OFFER OPEN AIN ACCESS.  

     BellSouth has filed a petition with the Federal Communications
Commission for expedited waiver of Part 69 rules in order to offer
open AIN access to third party AIN service developers.  The waiver
would clear the way for BellSouth to offer its DesignEdge service and
Basic AIN Programmability (BAP) Toolkit as tariffed services, and for
BellSouth itself to offer services built with the toolkit.  DesignEdge
and the toolkit are the first stage in a three-stage evolution to open
AIN access that BellSouth has long planned.  Providers would use the
toolkit to develop services -- using a limited set of AIN triggers and

UPSURGE IN PERSONAL NUMBERING PREDICTED

     Up to 4 million people in the United Kingdom alone will have a
portable telephone number within the next seven years, according to
Peter Gelardi, managing director of World Telecom plc, a supplier of
calling card and other value added services.  In his opening address
to the Universal Personal Telephony Conference, held in London in
December, Gelardi predicted that the rapid spread of personal
numbering will impact on employment prospects in the United Kingdom,
and have a profound effect on the British workplace.  This is because
parallel software developments will make the traditional message-
taking role of the secretary obsolete as screening and returning of
calls in person becomes much easier.
     Gelardi added that, "aligned to the growth of personal numbering
and the advent of number portability, what will be profitable for
telecommunications providers is value-added services rather than the
carrying of traffic, which ultimately will be free in the future."

Kingdom, for the provision of an advanced personal communications
service to be launched during the first quarter of 1996.  The
contract, the first won in Europe by TPS Ltd. since its launch in
April 1995, is expected to be worth approximately Pounds 10 million
($15.6 million) in the first three to five years. 
     The new service, called Cellnet Personal Assistant, is expected
to attract some 10,000 subscribers in its first year, rising to
"several hundred thousand" within three years.  The service provides
single number contact for all calls -- voice, e-mail and fax.  It also
screens calls; takes messages if the call is not connected; and
immediately notifies the user by pager, short message service (SMS) or
e-mail.  According to TPS, the service can connect more than 50
percent of calls on the first attempt, compared with a U.K. average of
20 percent.

INTELLIGENT PRIVATE NETWORK FROM BOSCH 

     Bosch Telecom has launched the Integral 33XE, a digital

intelligent private network (IPN).  With the new IPN technology, Bosch
can combine the benefits of both virtual private networks (VPNs) and

AMERITECH TO TEST PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Ameritech, the latest Bell regional holding company (RHC) to announce a test
of personal communications service (PCS), will attempt an ambitious, two-year
program beginning with simple, one-way calling and ending with two-way calling
that allows roaming.

Similar to Millicom's Orlando., Fla., test, Ameritech's network will operate
in the 1850-1990 megaHertz range, now used by fixed-point microwave operators.

The RHC said it will conduct both technical and marketing trials in the
Chicago area.  Chicago was chosen because of its "high concentration of
multiple types of radio traffic, a large variety of ... structures (including
high-rise buildings) and a complex customer base," Ameritech said.

In its most sophisticated form, the PCS will be able to make use of signaling
system 7 and integrated services digital network (ISDN), the RHC said.  It did
not say how the microcell channels would accommodate the greater bandwidth
requirements of ISDN and intelligent-network services.  Like most proposals
for experimental PCSs, Ameritech's request gave little technical detail.

The company would not say what manufacturer will supply the microcell base
stations, interfaces to the public switched telephone network and hand-held
phones.

Nor has the RHC determined where in the city it will start its test or when it
will begin, although it did say that it would conclude operations within two
years

Ameritech said it would test three different services.  The first, and most
rudimentary, is similar to Britain's telepoint service.  Users will be able
make and receive calls at home and make calls within 25 to 100 yards of
telepoint-type public base stations.

The second phase will add an alert signal to let a customer know that a call
is coming in.  As with the first phase, hand-off capability between cells will
not be available. The third stage network will allow customers to make and
receive calls from their homes and all public base stations and will have
hand-off capability.

Ultimately, up to 100 cell sites, each 50 to 200 yards in diameter, and 1,000
portable handsets may be used.

The RHC also will experiment with sending low-speed data over PCS, said Dave
Connolly, Ameritech Services manager of corporate strategy.

An important part of the trial will be testing what customers are willing to
pay for each type of service.  "We've had some people say, 'I don't want
two-way service.'  They don't want their phone going off in public," Connolly
said.

How To Please Everyone?

Ameritech envisions offering a variety of PCS services, he added. "At home,
they may want full, two-way service like their regular phone.  Outside the
home they may want something else."

Which presents Ameritech with the formidable problem of letting the customer
change service at will.  To arrange that, Ameritech will rely heavily on
intelligence within its wireline network.

"When you read the other [PCS] filings and they ask for personal
communications networks, they're asking for a specific type of service with
switching and intelligence and databases," Connolly said.  "We want to use our
own [wireline] network for that to keep the radio network simpler."

By testing increasingly complicated systems, the RHC also will face the
difficulty of finding one or more manufacturers who will develop products to
order, Connolly noted.  Sticking with one manufacturer would simplify matters,
but "We're going to see how things develop and who can to what for us" before
deciding, he said.

The company emphasized that it will develop an interface between the radio
systems and its wireline network that will allow furnishing ISDN and
out-of-band signaling.

At today's state of the art, however, Ameritech won't be able to provide true
"2B+D" service over the channels covering just 50 MHz of radio spectrum.
Customers probably will not be able to use their PCS phones to transmit voice
and data at the same time, Connolly said, "But even one "B" plus "D" is better
than other proposals,"  The D channel could be used to provide information
about signal strength and facilitate hand-off, he said.  And
intelligent-network services such as call forwarding, selective call blocking
and caller ID also would be possible.

PCS SUGGESTIONS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAR -- NOBODY AGREES

The personal communications service (PCS) comments submitted to the FCC Oct. 1
set a landmark of sorts.  Rarely have so many parties intensely held such
different views about what a new service is or should be.  Roughly 100
personal communications service (PCS) comments, comprising some 3,000 pages,
submitted to the FCC Oct. 1, testify to the discord.

But on one thing commentors agree:  Consumers want new wireless services.
According to figures furnished by Motorola, there are more than 100 million
communications devices (excluding CB and toys) in use today.  Land mobile
accounts for 48 million subscribers, as of Jan. 1, 1990.

Over 50 million cordless telephones are in service.  And cellular subscribers
have passed the 4-million mark.  Motorola projects that these combined
categories will grow from 100 million to almost 500 million by the end of this
decade.  That would equal nearly one wireless device for every two local
access lines. Millicom backs up its contention with a study from Arthur D.
Little which indicates that 40 percent of all U.S. households would subscribe
to PCN if it were priced $10 above existing telephone service.  The percentage
dropped to 14 if the service were priced at $40 above existing telephone
service.

CT-2, or outgoing, telepoint-type systems; digital European cordless
technology (DECT), a CT-2 variation accepted in Europe; and personal
communications service (PCS) proponents are joined by cellular carriers,
telephone companies and private radio service providers in their optimism
about the vast market potential for both wireless devices and services.
That's where agreement stops.  As a result, PCS is sure to be built on a
foundation of controversy.

The Miles-Per-Hour Spectrum

GTE, for instance, sees PCS in "miles-per-hour" categories.  That is, the
speeds at which mobile users are moving.  It characterizes today's cellular
service as a "60 mph service," in which customers are moving at high speeds
over wide areas.  To GTE, a new "6 mph service" is emerging that will meet
pedestrian needs -- a local offering designed for short walking distances.
Finally, GTE envisions a "zero mph service" that would be used in specific
locations.  Wireless PBX or wireless building networks fall under this
category.

In contrast, McCaw Communications, one of the largest non-wireline cellular
carriers in the country, envisions PCS as a continuum of mobile services
integrated into a seamless network. In this plan, cellular provides the core
network on which new microcellular PCS services will be introduced.
Pedestrian and in-building needs should be met by existing cellular spectrum
or through new spectrum for cellular carriers.

Telephone companies have a fundamentally different view.  They see wireless
services as a new means of accessing the established public switched network.
These "tetherless" access systems would consist of residential- or
business-area transceivers which would:  1) be a substitute for local loops,
2) replace in-building wiring with more flexible systems,  3) provide local
area computer networks,  4) meet needs of special communities such as trailer
parks, marinas, resorts and convention centers, and  5) provide a less
expensive form of telephone service to remote areas, now referred to as basic
exchange telephone service.

The telephone companies insist that PCSs are best built upon the telephone
infrastructure of the future with its digital switching, integrated services
digital network transmission, signaling system 7 and intelligent-network
capabilities.

New Kid On The Block

Millicom and other PCS proponents have a radically different concept in mind.
To them, PCS will be a stand-alone, digital network of advanced microcellular
networks.  Local-exchange telephone service would be a competitive business
opportunity, not an infrastructure to be built upon.

CT-2 and DECT advocates argue that pedestrian-based services can offer
improved residential cordless services, new public payphone services and
in-building telecommunications.  They complain that industry analysts are
unfairly denigrating their capabilities and overstating the ability of PCS and
cellular to meet such needs.

Private radio service providers are concerned that the commission's notice of
inquiry talks about common-carrier services without leaving adequate room for
private-carrier provision of PCS.  Private carriage may be appropriate in
cases such as self-contained, in-building networks. Cordless telephone
manufacturers simply want out of the PCS debate.  They worry that the
Telecommunications Industry Association's request for new 46-49 MHz
frequencies will be delayed and ensnared in the PCS melee.

As if these different visions of PCS weren't enough cause for debate, the
comments reveal sharply contrasting technical, spectrum-allocation,
eligibility and federal/state jurisdiction issues.

Will It Work?

Three basic technical approaches for PCS are suggested.  Not one of them,
however, has been field tested in a real-life situation. Qualcomm advocates
code division multiple access (CDMA), a digital, spread-spectrum technology
that permits numerous calls on one channel.  CDMA would permit PCSs to share
frequencies with existing services, its advocates say.

Motorola, GTE and AT&T question whether CDMA can operate without its own
exclusive spectrum allocation.  Millicom's test in Orlando, Fla., where a
version of PCS will be tested in the private, fixed microwave range, may
resolve the question. Time division multiple access (TDMA) systems similarly
do not emerge unscathed.  Motorola, McCaw and others note that TDMA has not
been adequately tested.

Centel has announced another variant -- "narrow advanced mobile phone systems"
(NAMPS). NAMPS, an analog technology, would use discrete portions of the
cellular bands for microcellular applications.  The technology, developed by
Motorola, will be tested next year in Las Vegas. A fourth option, only hinted
at to date, is frequency hopping. AT&T has indicated it will explore this
technology.

In short, no one really is sure what CDMA, TDMA, NAMPS or frequency hopping
can offer.  They must undergo a wide variety of tests in the lab and in the
field.  Until test results are in, the agency can't answer questions such as
whether spectrum sharing is possible or how many PCSs technically could be
accommodated in any given market.  The last point clearly affects whether or
not PCS spectrum scarcity is real or perceived. The FCC specified 1850-1990
MHz as a potential home for PCS.  But none of those holding licenses to
operate in that spectrum are stepping forward to volunteer to relocate.  In
fact, law enforcement agencies, petroleum companies, railroads, broadcasters,
public utilities and others have all argued that it would be prohibitively
expensive and technically dubious for them to be evicted from or forced to
share their spectrum.

Stunting Growth

In addition, private and common carrier land mobile operators want to hang on
to the three unused 1 MHz slices of spectrum in the 900 MHz band that the FCC
has suggested using for CT-2 and DECT.  They need it, they say, to handle
specialized mobile radio and paging growth.

Here, engineering fades and a political question appears:  Does the FCC have
the will and fortitude to act in the face of such opposition?

Assuming the FCC finds new spectrum for PCS, the most contentious issue of all
looms -- Who will be allowed to file for new spectrum?  The FCC's notice
offers two tentative possibilities. First, to promote competition, cellular
carriers would be barred from using new PCS spectrum to expand their systems.
Second, some new spectrum might be set aside for local telephone companies to
introduce new telephone services.

Telephone companies, of course, support a telephone-company set-aside.
Non-wireline cellular carriers strenuously oppose any prohibition that would
prevent them from applying for new spectrum within their own cellular markets.

If The nature of the game and the rules are settled, that still leaves the
question of referees.  State utility commissions argue against any FCC
preemptions or classification of PCSs as private radio services.  That would
automatically preclude state regulation under Section 332 of the
Communications Act.  They are joined by rural independent telephone companies
concerned about PCS as bypass threats.

The plain fact is that there aren't many hard facts in the opening comments.
Nor is it likely that such information will materialize in time for the Dec. 1
reply comments.  Given this state of affairs, the commission is left either to
remain idle until tests are finished or to take a more active role and set
guidelines. -- Nancy J. Victory

LO-JACK SEARCHES FOR STOLEN VEHICLES, UNCOVERS PRODUCT DEMAND

It's pretty rare to have a stolen car recovered an hour and a half after
thieves take it, but that is the average time it takes police to track down
cars equipped with small, hidden transmitters sold by Lo-Jack Corp., of
Needham, Mass.

When an owner reports a Lo-Jack-equipped car as stolen, police transmit unique
code to the Lo-Jack unit in the vehicle, "waking" it up.  It begins
broadcasting a regular, pulsing signal over the low end of the FM band.

Patrol cars pick up the signal on special Lo-Jack receivers, which print out
the stolen car's description and vehicle identification number.

A compass-like device in the patrol car points in the direction of the stolen
car, indicating which way to turn to home in on it.

Since the company began selling them in Massachusetts in 1988, 50,000 Lo-Jack
units have been installed, and 1,200 stolen cars have been retrieved -- a 95
percent success rate -- the company says.

Lo-Jack sells its transmitters through new-car dealers and provides the
patrol-car receivers and related equipment to police departments for a nominal
$1 charge.

With 15 million new vehicles sold each year in the U.S. -- and a car stolen
every 30 seconds -- Lo-Jack has tapped into a lucrative market, says
securities analyst Jyoti Aggarwala, whose firm, Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., of
New York, recommends Lo-Jack stock as a long-term investment. If the company
wins just 1 percent of the new car market, it will garner $45 million
annually, she estimates.

But Lo-Jack, which went public in 1983, has yet to show a profit, largely
because it must spend about $2 million each time it enters a new state,
according to company president Michael Daley. Lo-Jack's current strategy is to
focus on stolen-vehicle recovery, not vehicle location.  It strives to get its
systems adopted by police agencies, preferably the state police, in what Daley
terms the "top 10 states," where 60 percent of the nation's auto sales and
thefts occur.

Though it only expanded outside Massachusetts in 1988, Lo-Jack already has
recruited police departments in Miami, Chicago and Detroit, and anticipates an
agreement with state police in Illinois, where 63,000 cars were stolen in
1988. Daley and Aggarwala agree that Lo-Jack should be profitable by 1992.

By then, however, Lo-Jack may be feeling the heat from some competitors.  So
far there is one entry: the Intercept system from Code-Alarm of Madison
Heights, Mich.

Sounding The Alarm

When an Intercept-equipped car is stolen, a transmitter hidden in the vehicle
begins broadcasting the car's location to Code-Alarm's headquarters, using the
cellular telephone network. The module knows the car is stolen because other
sensors on the car have been tripped, explains Mary Gingrich, Code-Alarm's
operations coordinator.

The module knows its location because it receives the broadcasts of the Loran
C network, a nationwide radio navigation system used by aircraft and boats,
which also covers one-third of the land area of the continental United States.

Code-Alarm headquarters, in turn, notifies local police of the stolen car's
location and even its speed.

Gingrich says that, if police approve, Code-Alarm can tell the Intercept
module to shut off the gas to the car's motor, bringing any chase to a
grinding halt.

Other competitors with products in the works include an Indianapolis, Ind.,
firm named MITS Inc. and International Tele-trac systems, which is testing a
cellular-based system for tracking fleet vehicles that Daley says could easily
be adapted to tracking stolen ones.

Of these, Teletrac's could represent a major threat because of Teletrac's
partnership with PacTel Corp., the cellular telephone subsidiary of Bell
regional holding company (RHC) Pacific Telesis.  (Lo-Jack has challenged that
partnership as a violation of the AT&T Consent Decree's ban on the provision
of information services by RHCs.)

Lo-Jack suffers a disadvantage over such competitors, noted Dennis Zogbi, an
analyst with the U.S. Market Perspective division of World Information
Technologies in Northport, N.Y. "Owners have to notify police before a search
for a car begins. If somebody steals a car at night, the owner may not be
aware of it until morning.  In New York City, most cars stolen in Manhattan
are driven into New Jersey and disassembled in "chop shops" within 30
minutes."

Element Of Surprise

Daley acknowledged the potential problem, but said that Lo-Jack owners have
had little difficulty in actual practice.  "We don't perceive it as a
weakness," he said.  "We have recovered cars within hours, days and weeks of
being stolen without damage.  The thief doesn't know whether a driver has left
a car for a few minutes or a long time."

Thieves also don't know if the car is equipped with Lo-Jack, and aren't likely
to take the time for a thorough search, Daley said. "In this state
[Massachusetts] we've had thieves steal the car, then drive it somewhere to
cool off.  They go back in several days to see if it's still there."

In real life, more sophisticated systems such as Code Alarm's have
difficulties, too, Daley said.  "The owner must set codes on leaving the car
and returning."  If not, the alarm goes off.  If the owner forgets the code or
a family member who doesn't know the code takes the car, a false alarm may
result.

In any case, there is still a delay.  "The police must contact the owner to
verify that it is, in fact, a stolen vehicle.  The police don't want to be
embarrassed or be sued for false arrest," Daley said. "And since they operate
on cellular, they can only be used in cities or areas of heavy vehicle
traffic," he noted.

In confronting these competitors, Lo-Jack will likely maintain a decided price
advantage, Agarwalla notes.  Its Lo-Jack Retrieve product, the transmitter,
sells for $595, including installation, which Lo-Jack representatives do
themselves, randomly concealing the device in one of 35 locations on the car.
There are no monthly charges because the unit is used only if police activate
a hunt for it.

For customers in Massachusetts and Florida, the deal is even better:
Insurance companies there give those who also buy Lo-Jack's optional $100
Lo-Jack Prevent product, a theft-prevention device, at least a 25 percent
reduction in the cost of their comprehensive auto insurance coverage.

And, if the customer's car is stolen and not retrieved, any Lo-Jack customer
gets his Lo-Jack investment refunded. By comparison, Code-Alarm's Intercept
costs $1,495, including installation and a cellular telephone.

Lo-Jack scored a coup last year when the FBI, at Lo-Jack's request, persuaded
the FCC to designate a special frequency (173.075 megaHertz) for use
nationwide by Lo-Jack's small transmitters.

Daley says the FCC's action will smooth police acceptance of the devices,
eliminating the need to gain a specific FCC license for each state.

For the future, Daley says Lo-Jack will "expand this network till we cover one
end of the country to the other," largely by winning the involvement of police
agencies along major transportation corridors on both coasts and along
Interstate 80 through the Midwest and West, he says.

Lo-Jack, he adds, is also discussing cooperative arrangements with European
police agencies, and, one day, would like to expand the use of its technology
to recover stolen aircraft and boats. Just last year, he notes, a Lo-Jack unit
installed in a truck led to the breakup of a hijacking ring when that truck
was stolen and tracked to a Florida warehouse.

Police found the truck in less than an hour, Daley says.

TELEPOINT-TYPE SYSTEMS MORE LIKELY TO BECOME PROFITABLE

A British consulting firm has concluded that telepoint-type systems, limited
though they are, are more likely to return profits to investors than personal
communications networks (PCN).

"We see a window of opportunity for telepoint," said Enda Hardiman, general
manager of telecommunications market analysis for London-based BIS Mackintosh.

Telepoint, as used in Britain, is a one-way telephone system accessed outside
the home.  Users move to within a few hundred yards of a base station
(typically mounted on a building) and make outgoing calls.

The keys to telepoint success, according to BIS, are its low cost compared to
personal communications and telepoint's proven technical feasibility.  Three
such systems have been operating in London for more than a year, noted Ian
Reese, author of an analysis comparing telepoint to PCN.  In contrast, no PCNs
have been put into commercial service or given field tests.

"PCN operators are caught between a rock and a hard place," Hardiman said.
The current estimate to produce a PCN phone, which can receive calls as well
as make them, is about $3,000, he said.  A telepoint phone, which is limited
to placing outgoing calls, costs about $400.

PCN operators are either going to have to retain a high price for the phones
or subsidize them with income from high airtime charges, Hardiman said.

Because PCN must be considered a riskier investment than telepoint, operators
will have to pay higher interest rates to investors, according to Reese.  As a
result, a PCN system large enough to cover 60 million people (about the
population of Great Britain and Ireland combined) would become profitable nine
or 10 years after startup.

Getting The Payback

A telepoint system of equal capacity, on the other hand, would begin making
money in its sixth year, according to Reese's analysis.

"Unlike telepoint, PCN is unproven, and the rational investor should attach a
high level of risk to investment in PCN," BIS said.

PCN is seen as a much larger system, attracting some seven million subscribers
by the end of the seventh year of operation, as opposed to 600,000 telepoint
subscribers in the same period.

Revenue per subscriber would be about the same, however. Telepoint subscribers
are projected to pay about $700 a year for airtime, whereas PCN subscribers
would pay about $800, according to Reese.  The telepoint figure matches
revenues quoted by current system operators.  The PCN estimate is based upon
average use of cellular telephones in the United Kingdom.

BIS estimates that the hypothetical PCN would realize a profit of about $100
million in its first year in the black, or 3.6 percent of total investment.

By the end of the same period, telepoint would increase in value about 75
percent, Reese said.  That corresponds to an increase in value of about $104
million on an investment of $140 million. The sizeable increase can be
attributed to predicted profit margins.  "Like other telecommunications
infrastructure investments, once the major initial capital outlays have been
recovered there is considerable potential for large and sustained profits as
the service matures," BIS said.

"PCN must, for the time being, be regarded as a high-risk investment with
uncertain long-term yield prospects," Reese concluded.

Bell Atlantic, which proposes to begin a telepoint field test in Philadelphia
in December, had no estimates of demand for service or when a commercial
system might become profitable. "At this time, we're just testing the
technology," a spokeswoman said.

PAC TEL PROPOSES MOST EXTENSIVE U.S. PCS TEST

Pacific Telesis has proposed a two-year, five-city research project into
personal communications service (PCS) radio frequency (RF) propagation and
systems performance.

Pac Tel applied for an experimental license on the eve of the Oct. 1 deadline
for comments on the FCC's inquiry into advanced wireless technology.

"PCS is more than just wireless cellular," said Stagg Newman, Pac Tel's
assistant vice president for corporate strategy.

Pac Tel wants to "provide a 'global' picture of radio propagation and
interference characteristics at different frequencies," he said.  The systems
tests are designed to "provide an understanding of the new PCS system
alternatives, including propagation characteristics, system capabilities,
functionality, economies and preliminary user acceptance," the company said.

Although Pac Tel, Pacific Bell and PacTel Cellular will focus on advanced
wireless communications, many of the features contemplated will rely on
intelligent network capabilities. If Pac Tel's experimental license is
granted, testing will start with examinations of how signals of various
frequencies and power levels behave in different cities, starting with San
Francisco and Los Angeles and reaching across the country to Chicago, Dallas
and New York.

Narrowband and wideband testing will be done in the following frequency
ranges: 614-806 megaHertz (now allocated to UHF television), 824-849 MHz and
869-894 MHz (cellular telephone services), 849-851 MHz and 894-896 MHz
(air-to-ground services), 864-868 MHz (public safety and specialized mobile
radio).

Also, 901-902 MHz, 930-931 MHz and 940-941 MHz (general purpose mobile radio
and advanced paging) 902-928 MHz (industrial, scientific and medical [ISM]
services, automatic vehicle location and amateur radio), 1850-1990 MHz
(point-to-point microwave), 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz (point-to-point
microwave) and 2400-2483.5 (ISM and low-power or spread-spectrum uses).

Pac Tel will seek out "challenging RF environments" to test propagation and
interference characteristics.  "These tests  will encompass five metropolitan
areas, each with distinct topography, and will include a combination of
in-building, on-street and unique coverage situations at ranges of less than
and greater than one kilometer," the company said.

The tests will attempt to answer some of the questions the FCC posed in its
PCS inquiry, namely:  "Can PCS be overlaid within existing spectrum
allocations on a shared basis?" and "Can multiple spread spectrum operators
share the same spectrum?"

Newman said these tests will attempt to settle the debate about whether
spread-spectrum technologies can, in practice, share the same frequencies as
point-to-point microwave.

Seeing Double

The second phase of Pac Tel's testing proposal will focus on tests of at least
two "technology platforms" and will reflect experience gathered from the RF
propagation and interference research.  About 100 handsets and 20 to 30 base
stations will be established for each technology in a given city.

The basic system will offer a "low-end, low-functionality" service with small,
low-cost handsets providing an "enhanced version of CT-2," according to
Newman.  The second will be a "high-end, next-generation cellular" service
complete with "intelligent network functionality," he said.

TELEZONE SET TO BEGIN IN 1992

American TeleZone will begin public service in two years, according to CEO
Robert Gray.  Others are anticipating service launches in 1995.

TeleZone is aiming to avoid the FCC's personal comunications inquiry and the
process of licensing equipment.  The company's one-way, telepoint-type system
will operate under Part 15 of the FCC's rules, governing devices such as
model-airplane controls, which do not require licenses.

TeleZone's greatest lure will be price.  "We plan [to offer] unlimited calls
for $50 a month, and we can go a whole lot lower than that," Gray said.

ACT TO TEST CT-2 PBX

The first company in the country to operate an experimental telepoint-type
system will test wireless PBXs early next year, according to its founder.

American Cordless Technology (ACT), Montville, N.J., has received FCC and New
York State Public Service Commission permission to operate an experimental
CT-2 system in Manhattan, said Matt Edwards, the company's president.  ACT
expects to begin service in "early 1991," Edwards said.

The company plans to cover Manhattan south of the Brooklyn Bridge and the
region's three main airports: Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark, Edwards said.

ACT plans to install roughly 200 base stations.  Most will go on the outside
of buildings but 50 will be placed on already installed PBXs.

COMSAT, BELL ATLANTIC TEAM UP

Comsat and Bell Atlantic have joined to build an emergency radiotelephone
network.  The National Transportable Telecommunications Capability will use
existing cellular and satellite products to provide communications to federal
agencies during natural disasters or civil emergencies.

Comsat is to provide Ku-band satellite links to the public telephone network,
fixed earth stations, a digital telephone system and microwave transmission.
Bell Atlantic will provide cellular switching, cell base stations, towers,
antennas and cellular phones.

The whole thing goes in a package that can fit on a C-130 cargo airplane.

BRITS START PCN OPERATORS' GROUP

The three companies licensed to establish personal communications networks in
the United Kingdom have formed an organization to promote use of their
transmission standard in other European nations.  The Association of European
PCN Operators consists of Unitel, Mercury and Microtel.

One objective of the association is roaming service for subscribers.  DCS
(digital cellular system) 1800 will operate at 1.8 GHz and is based on 900 MHz
GSM, the standard for the proposed Pan European Digital Cellular System.

GIANTS ENGAGE IN BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

The Japanese telecommunications service market is set for change as
the country's two telecommunications giants, Kokusai Denshin Denwa
(KDD) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) battle for dominance
NTT announced at the end of August it would launch an international
multimedia service ahead of domestic international carriers, and a
possible tie-up with several major international carriers.

In a counter-offensive, KDD announced a plan to circle Japan with a
new submarine cable called J-I-H in collaboration with regional
carriers such as Tokyo Telecommunication Network(TT-Net). This
would expand the number of landing points it has from seven to 20
and challenge domestic long-distance carriers like NTT. KDD
estimates a 10 per cent share of the market with investments at 100
billion yen (US$93.4 billion). The J-I-H cable will not be in place
until 1999, but KDD does have another option for entering the
market-its microwave network which is already in place.

ONSE TELECOM-NEW POWER IN KOREA

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Newly-established Onse Telecommunications Corporation, is expected
to be awarded long-distance and local service telecommunication
licences by the end of this year. This is in addition to the
international service licence it was awarded in summer.

The licenses would enable Onse to become the third major
telecommunications power in the Korean wired communications market
after Korea Telecom and Dacom . The award to a relatively unknown
entity such as Onse has raised questions about the company's
ability to compete with telecommunication giants like Korea Telecom
and Dacom.

Onse has eight major shareholders and few have any experience in
the country's telecommunications business: These include Haitai,
Halla, Lotte, Korea Electric Power (KEPCO), Asea Cement, Daeryung,
and Ko Hai.

Already, Asea and Daeryung have announced a merger which would give
them a 30 per cent voting interest, but this grouping is unlikely
to wrestle controlling power from KEPCO.

JAPAN'S PHS GEARS UP FOR DATACOMS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Japan's PHS service is gearing up for a new phase with the
introduction of new high-speed data communications products from
Kyocera and DDI Pocket.

Kyocera announced that it will launch the country's first PHS
handset with an internal modem card. Its Datacope handset will be
capable of receiving, displaying and sending e-mail at up to 2,400
bps.

In a related development, DDI Pocket will offer PHS handset
adapters this December. The adapters will allow PHS handsets (eg.
the Datacope) 14.4 Kbps data transmission capability. The company
expects at least two other makers to have similar models out by
year's end.

PHS advocates believe the system is the ideal mobile handset
service for accessing the Internet and multimedia. The system was
designed to communicate at 32,000 bps, but users can only transmit
or receive data at up to 9,600 bps at present.

PHS handsets capable of transmitting at 32,000 bps are expected to
appear next spring after interface specifications for the system
are completed and announced by the PHS Internet Access Forum before
the end of the year.

KOREA TELECOM'S NEW VISION IN TROUBLE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MIKE GALBRAITH

BARELY three months after it unveiled its long-term vision-called
"KT Vision 2005"-Korea Telecom (KT) is having severe short-term
problems regarding the implementation of old rudimentary
privatisation plans set in motion several years ago.

The vision paints a rosy picture of the company's future as a
successful private company, and outlines three main goals-30
trillion won (US$3.84 trillion) in revenues, a global management
system and lifelong benefits for employees by the year 2005.

Despite the desperate need of the Ministry of Finance and Economy
(MOFE) to tap the privatisation of KT as a key source of funds,
even the transfer of a significant share of the company's stock
into private hands is making little progress. In the last two
years, nothing has happened.

Union Challenge

More serious, though, has been the challenge to change mounted by
the labour union which has threatened to bring the country to a
halt. The union activists fear that privatisation will mean loss of
jobs, reduced benefits and job insecurity, and have found a number
of allies among extremist religious and student groups. The climax
of their activities was in June when they seized the office of the
Minister of Information and Communications.

KT Vision 2005

As a result, Korean president Kim Young-Sam sacked the president of
KT and installed Lee Joon, a former four-star general who was in
charge of the First Army. Lee Joon is taking the credit for "KT
Vision 2005".

Experts, however, believe that, so far, privatisation, and possibly
the new vision, are intended to be mainly cosmetic gestures to
distract attention from KT's troubles.

Others doubt that the company will be able to transform itself
successfully into the envisioned dynamic competitive carrier when
it really loses its monopolies. The big squeeze is already upon KT.

Competition started in the long distance business this year and the
government is even set to licence two carriers to enter the key
local call business by the end of this year.

It is believed that the strongly entrenched vested interests of
monopolies will not relinquish their benefits without a fight, and
Korean monopolies are showing themselves to be of an usually
resilient breed that are very hard to break up.

Therefore, the government is going to have great difficulty in
meeting its obligation to move KT into the private sector by 1998,
which it is committed to do under World Trade Organisation (WTO)
provisions.

OECD Membership

Failure to do so would also jeopardise Korea's claim to membership
of the OECD. With such powerful opposing forces in conflicting
motion, the near and medium-term weather in and around KT looks
distinctly cloudy.

BRIDGING YOUR BUSINESS WITH THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

A large transportation company provides improved customer service
utilising a simple screen pop based upon the calling line
identification (CLID) feature of ISDN.

As a customer calls in to request a pickup of a parcel, the account
representative automatically sees the customer's profile before the
call is answered.

This type of service can significantly reduce the call duration of
a standard parcel pickup request and removes the majority of the
repetitive components of the customer service representative's
daily routine.

Furthermore, this CTI customer has enhanced the database
application that the customer service representative uses so that
the database application automatically prompts the customer service
representative to discuss issues that the caller has inquired about
previously as well as additional information such as service
enhancements and parcel tracking.

Possible enhancements to this customer's configuration would be to
screen the incoming calls and review the customer numbers.

Premium customers (the 80/20 rule where 80 per cent of your
revenues are generated from 20 per cent of your customers) could be
queued with higher priority into the call center.

As well, an automated voice response system could be used to screen
callers looking for tracking information and parcel confirmation.

A credit card service bureau with local call centers in Japan, San
Francisco, New York, and Paris implemented a networked CTI solution
which provided a complete pay back in less than four months on long
distance toll charges alone.

This customer provides services for Japanese credit card holders.
As is typical in a service bureau, the agents are required to
provide a different level of service for different callers
depending on the services that the originating company contracted
with the service bureau.

In this particular case, the average call duration was eight
minutes as agents scrambled to determine the appropriate level of
service based on the callers profile.

The service bureau implemented a complete CTI solution in which a
SQL database was integrated with an voice response system and a
complete integrated network of call centers.

When an incoming call terminates on an agent, the SQL database will
be automatically triggered to enable the appropriate services for
the caller based upon the DNIS number and the callers
identification.

Depending on the callers' request, the caller inquiry could be
serviced locally or transferred (with the account data attached) to
a remote call center.

This configuration reduced the average call duration from eight
minutes down to three minutes per call and significantly enhanced
the professionalism of the call center.

Another CTI customer is a service center for a large multinational
semiconductor firm.

They have centrally located their Asian call centre and configured
a series of 1-800 telephone numbers from all Asia-Pacific countries
to centrally terminate upon the call center. The call center is
configured in teams which provide an account-focused service
center.

Each team handles calls from a particular country and/or account.
The customer uses a CTI technology to provide priority queuing for
the premiums customers, as well as basic ACD overflow capabilities
where, if all the team members are engaged, the calls will overflow
to another team/cell.

This CTI solution has provided a means for this customer to provide
a centralised call center which centralises the unique skills
required to support their customer, as well as enhancing the
services for previous customers.

Next Issue

Next month, we will take a look at the latest API-Javatel. This API
may turn out to be the best way  to ensure long term viability in
your CTI solution because Java will be supported on multiple
platforms. The Javatel API will support  multimedia transmission
over both the Internet and regular phone lines.

NORTEL CONTRACT

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Mandarin Communications, one of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees, has
awarded Nortel a contract worth HK$426 million (US$54.9 million)
for a DCS 1800 network. The DMS Supernode MSC network is expected
to be in place by mid 1997, when the operator is to roll out
services.

Concern

However, it is still unclear whether the Hong Kong market is
overcrowded; a concern to which Richard Siemens, Mandarin's deputy
chairman and managing director addressed: "A consolidation may be
noticeable in the near future with the weaker ones being swallowed
by the stronger PCS operators."

NOKIA TO SUPPLY TO HK PCS OPERATORS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Nokia is to supply the new digital cellular network equipment for P
Plus Communications, one of Hong Kong's new personal communications
services (PCS) license operators.

The initial value of Nokia's contract for phase one and two will
exceed US$30 million. Hong Kong's telecommunications regulator,
OFTA, officially handed over the PCS license to P Plus on Sep 30.

Nokia will supply P Plus with a complete personal Communication
Network (PCN) system which will be based on DCS 1800 technology.

The contract includes the switching platform, base station and
controllers, and the network management system. Nokia has already
started installing and testing the equipment.

hk to play vital role in china's telecommunication growth

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

HongKong Telecom's (HKT) biggest intangible asset is its
relationship with China, states a recent equity research report
published by an investment bank.

Salomon Brothers, recommending a 'buy' for the operator's shares to
stock players, predicts that HKT will play a major role in China's
cellular growth within the next 6-12 months, boosting its stocks,
which recently plummeted to an all-time low of HK$15 (US$1.9).

In the past, HKT has actively transferred equipment to the
mainland's various ministries of posts and telecommunications and
has also been instrumental in training the PTTs' engineering and
management staff.

The competitive pressure is rising in China, observes the report,
initiating potential new business ventures that will be thrown in
the direction of the Hong Kong operator.

At home, HKT's opportunities lie in its future businesses such as
interactive video-on-demand, home shopping and banking services, to
be introduced in mid-1997. These will raise network layout costs
tremendously, though it is believed that expected increase in
network traffic within Hong Kong will compensate for that cost. The
research also notes that the company is addressing issues such as
cost control to position itself strategically in the global telecom
market. According to Dan Sherman, regional telecommunications
analyst at Salomon Brothers, "HKT is lowering its cost structure
which alone should enable the company to exceed current
expectations. Growth earnings will be seen in the range of 13 to 15
per cent over the next three years".

Slashes in expenditure are coming through staff reduction by
retrenching 700 to 1100 heads per year until 1998; an upper target
of 13,500 job cuts is expected to be reached by end of 1998.

Other major cost cuts are being implemented by outsourcing its data
and technical services to IBM, allowing an estimated savings of
HK$50 million (US$6.45 million) per year, says the report.

ATM CHARGE BY GDC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

US-based ATM switch specialist, General DataComm (GDC), is bringing
Apex-Strobos, its latest 25 Gbps ATM edge switch to the region. It
is currently vying for segments in vast ATM projects undertaken by
service providers like Hongkong Telecom.

In a recent agreement with Datacraft Asia, a regional systems
integrator, GDC will channelise its WAN and remote access products
into 10 countries within Asia Pacific.

In September this year, the two jointly lodged five separate
tenders for several major ATM backbone projects in a move to secure
major share in the rapidly deregulating Asian market.

GDC's chief operating officer, Ross Belson, intends to double his
company's 10 per cent revenue number from Asia Pacific within the
next year.

He said, "Our aim is to identify opportunities in huge potential
markets such as China, and at the same time provide constant
education to our customers who need to know about the constant
developments in areas such as telemedicine, remote site
videoconferencing and so on. We have bid for projects such as the
one with the ministry of health in China".

Experience

Belson believes Datacraft's experience and knowledge, especially in
the Chinese market will allow it to grab the market share it is
aiming for, even though the distributer has other ATM partners such
as Cisco, which recently acquired Stratacom, an ATM technology
specialist.

BIG ISLAND OFFER FREE YO-YO UPGRADE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Following HongKong Telecommunication's recent preview of its new
Caller ID for the territory, Big Island Communications has
announced a free text-to-speed upgrade to Yo Yo, the company's
Caller ID product.

With the upgrade, the product can use Caller ID, not only to put
the name of the caller on the screen, but hear the name spoken, all
before answering the phone.

Yo Yo includes a hardware attachment and software that allows a
user to screen calls, block calls, announce the caller, page the
caller information, and integrate those calls with several of the
leading contact management software programs.

Yo Yo, which was first released in June, and the new version Yo Yo
1.2.1, adds new features such as improved numeric paging, text-to-
speech caller announcement, and expanded call logging.

The new version's Yo Yo Logbook can now print, sort, and save the
duration, date and time for manually dialled calls.

For added ease of use, the Yo YoLand Yo Yo Phonebook now supports
printing and sorting. Yo Yo's Apple event support has been expanded
to allow an Apple Macintosh computer application to send alpha or
numeric pages via AppleEvents.

CORPORATE CHANGES FOR CHINA UNICOM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

China Unicom, the second mobile operator in China is undergoing
some major restructuring in its higher offices. The vice minister
of the Ministry of electronics industry (MEI), Liu Jianfeng, is
expected to take over as chairman replacing Yang Changji.

According to an Unicom spokesperson, the MEI is bound to have a
direct and more strong influence on the operator's activities in
future as opposed to the State Economic and Trade Commission, from
where the former chairman arrived.

One theory put forth by the spokesperson about the move was an
apparent reorganisation of MEI into a commercial corporation, which
is a fallout of the State's intended plans to turn the Ministry of
Electrical Power, Ministry of Metallurgical industry, and the MEI
into commercial entities. However, no confirmed steps have been
taken yet in this direction. The other theory put forth is
centralising Unicom's power in the regional branches.

The earlier interference of shareholders and state governments in
the regional operations will be ended by the headquarters taking
over control of these offices, especially in areas such as finance
and appointments of chiefs.

Currently, Unicom's shareholders comprise government and semi-
government bodies such as the MEI, the Ministry of Electric Power,
the Ministry of Railways, China International Trust and Investment
Corporation with various other companies and city governments. It
also receive international funding from foreign telecom groups.

STRANGE SHIFTS IN HK TELECOM MARKET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MAHLON CAMPBELL

A recap on growth of wireless telecommunications in the last five
years in Hong Kong has shown many peculiar changes in the market.

Both the cellular and trunk radio market has seen increases of over
300 per cent, the pager market only increased by 1 per cent and CT2
came and went like the wind.

According to Smartone Mobile Communications there has been
extremely strong growth in cellular and this is expected to
continue for the next five years. Pager growth saturated and
declined, while trunk radio continues to be a "niche" and private
network application. And CT2 has been replaced by cellular
upgrades.

Most telecom analysts tend to agree with Smartone's view point of
the wireless telco market, but tread carefully when commenting
about the future. They say the wait-and-see approach has to be
taken.

Analysts say, "with the new PCS license been awarded, it is
interesting to see whether the six service providers can come out
with products and services on time as promised."

"Right now in Hong Kong the cellular penetration is 16 per cent out
of a population of 6 million," said Christopher Lau, controller
services of Smartone. He added this is one of the biggest
penetrations rates in the region.

According to Lau, Smartone forecasts the total mobile subscriber
rate to be 2.5 million by the year 2000.

"We see that 45  per cent of the working population will have a
mobile/wireless communication device," said Lau.

Smartone feels that Hong Kong people view wireless communication as
a important part of their daily life. And the market changes are
driven by competition, technology, regulations, the countries
economy and peoples life style.

Lau said, "to date Smartone has 100,000 subscribers under its belt,
but this figure will grow further as the market changes."

But Smartone's predictions for the next 18 months are optimistic.
They claim that there will be an emphasis on non-voice services and
providers will explore new market segments due to saturation of
usage, competition and user behaviour change.

There will be messaging service developments with extensive use of
IVR/voice messaging together with voice recognition enhancement.

RAD'S KVF.3 TO ENHANCE QUALITY OF KILOMUX 2000

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

RAD introduces a new low bit rate voice module for its Kilomux-2000
called the KVF.3, which claims to maximise bandwidth utilisation
while ensuring quality voice reproduction.

With the KVF.3, the Kilomux-2000 is able to deliver user benefits
like lower per port costs and better performance which is enhanced
by the use of the Multipulse Maximum Likelihood Quantisation
(MPMLQ) voice compression technology.The MPMLQ is claimed to
minimise distortion levels through two compression/decompression
cycles.

The KVF.3 converts the fax analogue signal of incoming fax
transmissions to a digital one. It also supports voice compression
rates of 4.8, 6.4, 7.2 or 9.6 Kbps and several voice/fax calls can
be carried simultaneously over a single 64 Kbps link.

Offering a choice of 2-wire or 4-wire E&M, 2-wire FXO or 2-wire FXS
analogue interfaces, KVF.3 supports connections to PABX trunk and
extension lines, or telephone sets.

GSM MOU PREDICTS HIGH GROWTH FOR ASIAN CELLULAR MARKETS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY JOYITA HALDAR

In its four years of existence, the GSM standard has experienced a
commendable growth with networks operating on the system in 86
countries across the globe.

Furthermore, a 50 per cent penetration is predicted by the year
2000, pointed Gretel Hoffman, chairperson of the GSM MoU
association at its 35th, and the region's first GSM MoU plenary
session, recently held in Hong Kong.

Supporting such indications, industry consultants observe that the
standard will be established in 100 countries by the end of the
decade with over 230 operators installing GSM networks.

Soaring Demand

The session revealed that an estimated four million subscribers
come from Asia, and the cellular market in the region is nowhere
near saturation point as demand for such services across Asia is
soaring, and so is investment in those systems.

Pyramid Research, for instance, estimates that regional spending on
mobile communications networks will almost triple by 2000 to US$10
billion from today's levels.

In many areas across the region, cellular networks are going up
faster than ordinary networks based on land lines, since cellular
networks are much easier to install.

One such example is China, where different cellular technologies
have been and are being trialled, including GSM and CDMA.

Even though capacity is higher than the number of people connected
to any mobile services within the country, John Gilbertson,
Ercisson's managing director for Asia Pacific, is of the opinion
that demand will overtake capacity, and a close to four million
subscribers will be connected by the end of next year.

Such optimism in the mainland's cellular marketplace is reflected
in activities such as the recent buy-out by the German operator,
Deutsche Telekom, taking a 25 per cent stake in a cellular phone
venture, with local partner China International Trust and
Investment Corp. (CITIC), Siemens, and American International
Group, Inc.

The partners are expecting around 600,000 subscribers to connect to
its network by the year 2010. Running on GSM, the network will
cover the cities of Tianjin, Wuhan and QingDao. China Unicom, the
only cellular competitor to the MPT, will operate the GSM networks
which is expected to boost the European technology further in the
country. Currently, China is also trialling the DCS 1800 systems,
as a compliment to its 900 MHz spectrum.

Biggest Market

Kurt Hellstrom, president of Ericsson Radio Systems and a
participant at the session, noted that Asia's growing demand for
cellular services is lucrative enough to make it the swedish
telecom giant's biggest market, quoting that Hong Kong and China
were already its second biggest trading place. Referring to Hong
Kong's new PCS licences, he pointed that networks for such services
would also be GSM-based, only operating at a higher frequency band
than current systems.

These new mobile services roll-out and associated value added
services will only increase penetration level of mobile
communications in the territory from 18 to 40 per cent by the next
millennium, and the role of equipment suppliers will be to keep the
prices low to stimulate demand in mass markets such as Hong Kong.
Five of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees have already opted for the
GSM standard.

However, some major concerns of operators still need attention-one
being billing and collection where their major concern is offering
services to anyone that comes into their markets and recovering the
revenues; the other major point of focus is the assurance of
roaming facilities to as many countries as possible to the
subscribers.

MKTL'S PAGER LICENCE IN JEOPARDY OVER DE-ACTIVATION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Ministry of Communications is planning to initiate actions
against Modi Korea Telecommunications Ltd (MKTL) for its failure to
maintain a database for its pagers, a pre-requisite for the
industry.

It may even withdraw MKTL's licence.

Family problems have led to dissent at the top level within the
Calcutta-based MKTL's holding company, Rossell Industries, whose
sales turnover has dropped steeply in 1995-96 to one-tenth its
level two years earlier [Rs56.7 million (US$1.64 million), against
Rs516.8 million (US$14.99 million) in 1993-94].

On Sep 10, 1996, the Alipore Court had issued an order of
injunction, restraining MKTL from de-activating the services of
nearly 1,000 subscribers.

In utter disregard of the Court's instructions, MKTL disconnected
the services of the subscribers on the night of Sep 11.

The court issued another order on Sep 17, directing the company to
restore all connections.

This has not yet been done. MKTL has admitted that it is not
maintaining a database of pager users, and that it "needed the
pagers physically to ascertain the codification".

However, Appocon Consultants, in a letter to the Ministry of
Communications, has strongly urged the cancellation of MKTL's
licence "in the larger interests of the general public, as they are
not competent enough to provide such services".

INDIAN MINISTER IN CORRUPTION CHARGE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Pandit Sukh Ram, minister for Communications in the ousted Congress
(I) cabinet of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, is in the thick
of a massive corruption scandal that is threatening to turn the
entire telecoms world in India upside-down.

Sleuths of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided his
houses in New Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh), and found Rs 36
million (over US$ 1 million) in loose cash and jewellery, lying
about the houses in suitcases and attache-cases.

While all this was happening, Sukh Ram himself happened to be
abroad, having ostensibly gone there for medical treatment.

The minister has since been trying every trick in the book to evade
the sleuths, and avoid coming back to India. The latest was that he
had produced medical certificates to show that, as a heart patient,
he had been advised by his doctors not to travel to India during
September.

Sukh Ram has been unable to account for the money found in his
houses, but Congress is worried that he may  pass them off as funds
collected for the party.

There were several telecom firms that were his favourites, notably
Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd. (HFCL) and Advanced Radio
Masts, whom he favoured with orders after overruling the
recommendations of the Telecom Commission.

Fiat Issued

The new Communications minister, Beni Prasad Verma, has since
issued a fiat to the Department of Telecommunications (DOT),
separating the process of placing purchase orders from the
decision-making on telecom equipment.

He has said that all future orders will be placed by the
appropriate DoT authorities, and not by the minister.

ISDN SERVICES TO COMMENCE SOON IN INDIA

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in India  has upgraded
its existing Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) to commercially
introduce Inte-grated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services.

Prospective users were provided with ISDN connectivity by end-
October 1996.

Worldwide, ISDN has emerged as a powerful tool for integrating
voice, data and image signals.

It may even be used for provisioning voice, data and image services
through an existing telephone network.

"The PSTN has been suitably upgraded through the installation of
ISDN switches to handle computer data transfers at 64 Kbps.

Digital Transmission

"Previously, this was impossible. In addition, the PSTN facilitates
digital fax and image transmission," said MP Modi, chairman,
Telecom Commission.

"The speed of data currently transmitted through the PSTN is
significantly restricted by the design of codes supplied by various
switching system manufacturers," he added.

To date, the PSTN has been solely optimised for human voice
transmission at much lower speeds-ideally at 4,800 bauds per second
(bps), going up to a maximum of 9,600 bps.

As a result, to transmit computer data at high speeds-for example,
at 64,000 bps (that is, at 64 kbps)-a user was compelled to obtain
a leased line from the DoT at a phenomenal cost. Thus, the
installation of a 64 Kbps line for a customer located 5 km away
entailed a minimum initial investment of Rs26,500 (US$750), coupled
with a bi-monthly charge of Rs5,000 (US$141).

Worse, leased lines are prone to frequent failure.

Further, since the line is exclusive, the user seldom has the
option to switch over to a new line.

Officials at the DoT believe that ISDN subscribers will not face
such problems, and that data transmission at 64 Kbps will be
possible at substantially reduced prices.

A prospective ISDN subscriber will only need to procure a special
ISDN handset for Rs300 (US$8.70), an ISDN PC card to obtain 64 Kbps
access, pay the DoT registration fee of Rs3,000 (US$87), and a
Rs1,000 (US$29) monthly rental as basic access rate (BAR).

Simulataneous Calls

Importantly, ISDN subscribers will be able to simultaneously handle
two independent calls on an existing telephone line.

The transmission mode could be speech, data, image or video. The
call set-up time between two ISDN subscribers is also very short,
compared to PSTN.

OPERATORS BANKING ON PHS AS ALTERNATIVE IN THAILAND

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SUTHISAK KRAISRI

THAILAND will finally became the second country in the world to use
the Personal Handyphone System (PHS), a cordless technology created
by Japan.

Two operators are expected to introduce the system, United
Communication Industry (Ucom) and the Shinawatra Group are making
the first move to compete with fixed-line operators who have been
stepping into their mobile market.

According to the Telephone Organisation of Thailand, there is still
room for at least two more private mobile phone operators to invest
in the handyphone service as well.

Shinawatra has been faced with fierce competition, especially from
the in-flux of Internet-related businesses. To stay ahead, the
decision was made to embrace the handy-phone business.

"As Shinawatra Datacom has expertise in networking, it has
capabilities in providing handyphone services as well," said a
Shinawatra executive.

The Ucom Group shares the same idea. But its proposal may be closer
to reality.

Ucom has been shouldering huge losses caused by the freezing of the
CT2 business since three years ago. The company wants to convert
the one-way communication service-called Fonepoint in Thailand-into
a two-way service.

Ucom plans to use Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication
(DECT) technology to make the conversion.

Potential Doubt

Telecom analysts are doubtful of the potential of the PHS, and feel
that Thailand may not take to the technology as the Japanese have
done. Japan expects its number of registers to increase to three
million by year end. A TA senior executive said PHS would become
another choice for those who could not afford mobile phones.

The service is expected to gain wider acceptance in crowded
Bangkok-which offers a big market-but probably not in the
provincial regions.

Though the market potential is questionable, the Thai operators
have no qualms about the technology.

They believe that the investment in PHS is long-term and are hoping
that it will eventually develop into the same level as mobile
phones.

TA has promised to launch its personal handyphone by April next
year while TT&T also plans to introduce its products at about the
same time. The difference is that TT&T has already scaled down its
investment from investing in 20 provinces to around 8 provinces.

FOXCOM'S FIBREOPTIC TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

System 7000 is a low cost L-band (950 MHz-1750 MHz) distribution
system for satellite antenna remoting.

The system is suitable for situations where the highest possible
performance is not required and link distances do not exceed 10 km.
The system is designed to take its RF input from an LNB or
downconverter and directly convert this to 1310 nm light by means
of a Fabrey Perot laser. Transmission is via a 0.4 dB/km loss
single mode optical fibre.

System 7200 is the highend version and is intended for applications
such as Intelsat earth station antenna remoting, INMARSAT
transmit/receive, telecommunication interfacility links, and CATV
downlinks, where higher dynamic range is required.

The 7200 produces a better quality and higher power signal than the
7000 version by means of a DFB laser with low noise figure.
Effective transmission range is over 20 km.

The company's IF fibre optic transmission products include the 70
MHz or 140 MHz System 7070 (for links up to 5 km) and the higher
specification 7070D for links exceeding 20 km. The 7070D version
can operate in a multi-channel environment The 7070 series is
designed for broadcast up- and downlinks, teleports, and
interfacility communications for government and the military.

All of Foxcom's transmission products include an integrated
features set. Their plug-and-play capabilities incorporate
automatic gain control (AGC) that maintains optimum operation over
a wide range of signal levels and channel lineups and that enables
the end-user to set up the equipment easily.

All products also include (as an option) the 7050 bi-direction data
modem unit which provides an RS232 over single mode fibre link
between stations. The purpose of the 7050 is to monitor microcell
or antenna status and therefore can serve as part of a fibre break
diagnostic system.

OPERATORS RAISE FURORE OVER DOT'S DECISION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SHIRISH NADKARNI

INDIA's Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is facing tough
times.

This was made clear in mid-September when the DoT placed orders
with Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL) and Optel-two companies it had
earlier accused of being involved in a cartel.

In accusing the two companies, communications minister, Beni Prasad
Verma, had said: "We will take a serious  view of any cartelisation
that takes place. We will write strongly to the directors of these
companies against their involvement in the formation of cartels,
and ensure that we don't deal with these companies in future.

"In case companies get into a cartel again, we may be forced to
float a global tender."

But in mid-September, the DoT went ahead and placed orders with the
same companies-a proceeding that has caused waves of confusion to
wash through the industry.

"Since these two companies have been given the orders, it only
follows that they have gained from the cartelisation," said a
disgruntled competitor who had also hoped to get the order.

The tender had been floated on Mar 22 for the procurement of 21,000
km of fibre optic cable.

This included 9,000 km of six-fibre optical fibre cable, 10,500 km
of 12-fibre cable and 1,500 km of 24-fibre cable.

Sixteen bidders had taken part in the tender. They included
Sterlite Industries, Vikas Hybrid, Gujarat Optical, Birla Ericsson,
Aksh India, Optel, HCL, Plasmac and Bhilai Wires, Surana Telecom,
Sudarshan Telecom, Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited
(HFCL), Uniflex Cables, RPG Telecom and Plasman Telecom.

Cartel

When the bids were opened on May 21, it was found that all bidders,
barring Sudarshan Telecom, had engaged in the cartel.

They had quoted a price which was 16 per cent higher than the price
at which they had supplied orders the last time round.

All the prices were in a narrow range, which indicated that the
telecom companies had probably met and decided upon the quotations
they would make.

Sudarshan's quotations were substantially lower than that of the
other 15 bidders .

It had quoted Rs717.2 million for the supply of 9,000 km of the
six-fibre cable, while the other bidders' quotes ranged from
Rs961.9 million to Rs970.9 million.

Scandal

This is not the only scandal to rock India's telecommunications
industry.

In 1995, the former communications minister, Pandit Sukh Ram , had
scrapped the tender and placed orders with companies he favoured.

Sukh Ram is currently in Tihar Jail for having assets
disproportionate to his known sources of income.

Meanwhile, the DoT has been finding it difficult to get the holders
of the Letters of Intent (LoIs) issued by it for six basic telecom
circles, to sign the licence and interconnect agreements.

RPG Telecom, Tata Telecom, Hughes Ispat, Usha India, Essar Telecom
and Reliance-Nynex have all raised issues such as port charges,
billing disputes and arbitration, in separate letters to the DoT.

No Re-negotiation

"We are not re-negotiating the tender," explained a spokesperson of
Essar Telecom. "We want the scrapping of the clauses that were
added later to the tender, and which would make the projects
financially unviable.

"The inclusion of port charges, for example, is downright
unreasonable."

The LoI holders have also demanded that the roles of the DoT, the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the licensor be
clearly defined.

Said the Essar official: "All regulatory matters, such as the
review of the licensee's technology, quality of service standards,
and termination, revocation or suspension of licence, should be the
sole responsibility of the TRAI.

Arbitration

"Arbitration should be undertaken by an independent panel chosen by
an agreement between parties or undertaken by the TRAI when it is
established."

One of the major problems that the DoT is facing is that it is
sorely under-staffed.

Many managerial positions are vacant and there have been no
government sanctions to recruit new people.

The DoT is also plagued by the fact that all the telecom players
insist on having their say whenever any modification is made to any
agreement.

They are adamant that modifications should not be at the sole
discretion of the telecom authority, but by mutual agreement.

Clearly, considering the DoT's constant changes of stance in the
past, the operators are being extra cautious.

TWO-WAY PAGING SOLUTION FROM NEXUS FOR ASIA-PACIFIC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY LAWRENCE NORMIE

Nexus Telecommunications Systems was founded in 1991 to develop and
manufacture portable wireless communication and location products
for two-way paging, automatic vehicle identification, and
industrial monitoring telemetry.

Nexus has developed a  wide area communication and location network
technology that combines the cost-efficiency of one-way paging
technology with the huge market potential of portable two-way
communication and location systems.

System Overlay

The Nexus approach is particularly attractive because its product
overlays existing paging system infrastructures, consequently
implementation and operation costs are significantly reduced.

The Nexus two-way communications and location system exploits a
one-way paging infrastructure for the out-bound communications link
(from the network to the subscriber devices) and proprietary
digital  spread spectrum technology for the in-bound communications
link (from the subscriber to the network).

The frequency hopping spread spectrum technique is effective in
combating interference due to spectral congestion, multipath
propagation and jamming as well as providing communications
security. The network complies with US FCC standard Part 15 and
operates in the band between 800 MHz and 1 GHz.

The network uses interferometric techniques to determine the
location of a unit in the field.

Transmissions from the unit are received by at least two base
stations, each equipped with an array antenna to determine the
direction of arrival from the point of transmission.

The arrival angle is calculated at each base station and the result
transmitted to the command and control center, where the location
of the transmission is calculated and displayed on an electronic
map together with identification information.

Nexus has been active in the Asia-Pacific market for two years. The
Nexus "NexNet" two-way paging  and location network became
operational in Sydney, Australia this September, following the Nov
1995 signing of an agreement with INC Communication, an Australian
company engaged in data communications, manufacturing, and
services.

Wide Growth

"The roll-out of the Nexus system and technology is the direct
result of the wide growth of the paging market in Asia Pacific and
the popular demand for value-added services" said marketing manager
Adi Pundak-Mintz.

Shlomi Tenenberg (VP Sales) said that the company's 1997 objectives
include expansion into paging markets other than Australia.

The company also is seeking additional partners for deploying its
systems in local markets in Asia-Pacific.

Nexus technology already is being used under license in India and
two-way paging and end-units are manufactured for Nexus by Samsung
Electronics Corporation  (Korea) under a nonexclusive licensing
agreement.

According to Pundak-Mintz, specific product definition and
marketing  issues that relate specifically to Asia-Pacific include
high volume usage, the requirement for special character sets in
end-devices, and the high sophistication of technologically-
adaptive customers.

ISRAEL-THE LAND OF HIGH TECH OPPORTUNITIES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY PETER TSUKAHIRA

High-tech business culture is being transformed as the rate of
worldwide technological change steadily increases.

This is evident in fields none other than high-speed, local area
and wide area telecommunications.

The personal computer revolution has placed even greater computing
power on the desktop in offices and homes around the world.

With the explosive growth of electronic mail services and the
Internet's World Wide Web, more and more people are using their
personal computers as networking end-stations than ever before.
This surge of technological change, coupled with greater freedom of
access to networked information, is forcing the creation of new
types of corporate structures.

Older, hierarchical corporate structures with fixed chain-of-
command reporting and clearly defined functional "borders" are
unable to respond quickly enough to exploit developing market
opportunities.

Today's high-tech markets consist of multi-national, multi-cultural
organisations where even small and medium-sized manufacturers are
players in the global environment.

De-centralised corporate structures, based on personal
relationships and shared goals rather than rigid organisational
lines, are required to survive and thrive in this internationally
competitive environment.

Cultural Mosaic

Israel's society is young in the sense that the modern nation is
not yet even 50 years old. Israel is a cultural mosaic of
immigrants from literally every corner of the globe. Everyone, it
seems, has a different cultural background and this has resulted in
a society where boundaries tend to be relatively undefined and
where extreme informality is considered normal.

Israel is a small and militarily vulnerable country. Israeli army
officers are taught to view advance planning as necessary, but only
as a basis for making required changes. That is to say, they are
taught to quickly adapt to changing conditions, to improvise and to
have a positive attitude towards taking calculated risks.

Despite having invented one of the world's first minicomputers in
the early 1970's, the Israeli computer industry has not been a
force to be reckoned with until quite recently.

Israel's high-tech industry has grown rapidly and in the present
era of networked computing, this small nation fields a number of
high-tech developers and network device manufacturers
disproportionate to its size.

Representatives from key industry publications confide that Israel
has joined the greater Boston area and Silicon Valley as a major
geographical source of advertising dollars.

The reasons for Israel's new-found prominence in this field is
multifarious. It has to do with the youth and vitality of modern
Israel, a highly educated workforce and the motivation of the
talent available.

The Israeli high-tech industry excels at producing practical,
robust and relatively simple solutions for complex problems.
Perhaps this is the result of the kind of military training that
every young man experiences as part of his upbringing.

Quality performance in small groups and quick decision-making by
junior officers are Israeli traits developed in the army. These
abilities will serve Israel well in the fiercely competitive
international high-tech marketplace.

The computer networking world is still relatively new and growing
rapidly. Small groups of highly motivated engineers working in non-
structured environments can still create the next industry's "hot
box" or best seller product. Because time-to-market is crucial to
the success of a new product, quick decision making and on-the-fly
implementation are highly valued.

These Israeli capabilities have not gone unnoticed in the global
search for high-technology talent. Huge multi-national companies
have begun acquiring  smaller Israeli high-tech communications
companies.

In recent years, NiceCom, a Tel Aviv-based ATM developer was
acquired by 3Com; Scorpio Communications by US Robotics;
intelligent hub maker, LanNet was acquired by Madge of the UK and
LAN switch start-up, Ornet was bought by Siemens.

I believe the Asia Pacific societies place a high value on virtues
like patience, self-discipline and social cohesion. This is
reflected in the attitudes and behaviour of the workforce and Asian
"corporate culture."

These strengths lend themselves to precision manufacturing and high
quality, low cost mass production. It seems that as soon as a given
technology stabilises, companies in Asia Pacific add refinements
and then seize market leadership.

This is apparent in the worldwide market for computer memory chips.
This technology was pioneered in the US and Europe but now is
dominated almost entirely by Asian companies.

In spite of Asia Pacific dominance in a wide range of industries
from musical instruments and automobiles to optics and electronic
equipment of all kinds, one vital technology has proven most
difficult to master. This is the area of microprocessor design.
While Asia is the champion of computer memories, the US has
maintained a commanding lead in microprocessors.

The major US chip manufacturers (Intel, Motorola, National
Semiconductor) each have large facilities in Israel where
microprocessors and other devices like digital signal processors
are designed and built.

The Intel Corporation recently completed planning for the next
generation Pentium processor, the first to be developed entirely in
Israel. Intel also announced plans for an additional US$1.6 billion
dollar facility in Israel for flash memory fabrication.

An interesting but little known fact is that Silicon Valley in
California, a place where new technologies abound, is home to many
expatriate Israelis. When some high-tech companies in Israel
recruit, they will often place ads in local San Jose newspapers
hoping to catch experienced returnees.

As more Asian companies enter the global high-tech marketplace,
contact with Israeli technology developers will grow.

Partnerships

Collaboration between Israeli and Asian communications companies
have the potential to be extremely innovative and fruitful.

There are already some notable partnerships existing today
producing very positive results. Asian companies doing business
with Israel stand to gain not only technology but ideas. Israel's
close geographic and cultural proximity to Europe means access to
European market channels for Asian-Israeli business tie-ups.

Israeli high-tech products are to be found in operation on
customers' premises throughout Asia-Pacific. Direct investment in
Israel by South-east Asian multi-national companies is growing.
Increasingly, in today's global marketplace, the Far East will be
meeting the Middle East in high technology.

ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE SUBSCRIBER LOOP

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

FOR many new telephone users in fast-growth telecom regions such as
China, Korea and India, their initial experiences have been with
traditional phone services over ordinary twisted-pair copper
wiring.

However, major telecom providers in China and other countries are
now installing sophisticated high-speed, high-bandwidth, all-
digital backbone infrastructures.

But for most users, primary telephone services will, for now, be
based on this traditional, POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
model.

In POTS, the speaker's voice is carried over analogue circuits
which originate at the telephone's microphone. The signal is
delivered to a subscriber-loop switch. There, the voice waves are
converted into digital information then sent via high-speed lines
to the subscriber-loop switch of the receiving party.

But even within POTS, significant advancements are underway,
particularly in the key analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
conversion components, ie. the codecs.

For instance, thanks to semiconductor integration, codecs and their
related filtering functions-which used to require multiple chips-
were combined into single, integrated chips in the early 1980s.

The resulting devices contributed substantially to the worldwide
proliferation of digital telephone switches.

Now and in the future, newer DSP (digital signal processing)
technologies and smaller semiconductor process technologies are
enabling designers to build codecs with multi-channel
architectures.

Today, each telephone number requires a unique codec in the
subscriber loop switch. Multi-channel codecs will be able to handle
several independent subscriber telephone conversations
simultaneously.

Eventually, as many as 32 channels may be integrated in a single
piece of silicon.

The savings in space and cost will be significant.

And those savings will help further boost residential and business
telephone installations in countries such as China, where
expectations currently run as high as 20 million new line
installations per year.

Fibre to the Curb

Another advance involves the continual distribution of telecom
functions-and of "fat-pipe" digital bandwidth-closer to homes.

To do that, telecom providers are now able to place a multiplexer,
called a digital loop carrier (DLC-also known as a remote access
unit), between the subscriber-loop switch and the home.

The DLC helps to extend the geographical area served, and it
extends high-speed digital bandwidth for video and similar
applications closer to the user.

This type of distribution permits bringing "fibre to the curb," or
at least to the DLC.

Although copper twisted pair and coaxial cable are digital-capable,
fibre is preferred both for reasons of economy and because it
permits greatly extended service provisioning.

Another critical subscriber loop function is the subscriber line
card, or SLIC.

The SLIC co-exists with the codec at the subscriber loop switch or
the DLC. Its role is to perform certain supervisory functions, and
to balance the subscriber loop in order to produce an optimal
signal.

Subscriber loops vary in length and signal characteristics from
country to country and even among local services.

In response, the newest trend in SLIC technology involves software-
programmable balance features.

These permit providers to make on-site adjustments to meet various
specifications without requiring circuitry modifications. The
result: remotely-controlled automation, and more easily distributed
functionality.

Digital to the Door

In addition to "fibre to the curb", ISDN (Integrated Services
Digital Network) is fast gaining notoriety as a major performance
enhancer for Internet communications.

At up to 160 Kbps bandwidth, it can make Internet graphics seem to
jump onto the screen-a vivid contrast to the less nimble
performance of today's typical 14.4 and 28.8 Kbps modems.

Beyond its Internet performance, the advent of residential ISDN
represents a milestone in the evolution of the subscriber loop.

By simply adding ISDN transceivers at each end of the subscriber
loop, operators can make use of the same copper twisted pair wiring
now employed for low-speed analog services to deliver high-speed,
all-digital information right to the user's own computer.

All that is needed today, for people in many parts of the world, is
an ISDN adapter card or external modem, and an added service from
the telecom provider.

And for users in countries with newly-developing telecom
infrastructures, ISDN may be closer than it seems.

Today, the services may be analog POTS, but the backbone and
subscriber loop switches in developing countries such as China,
Korea, India, and Taiwan are ISDN-capable-good news for future ISDN
users in those regions.

Also good news is the fact that, as with other technologies, future
generations of ISDN transceivers are destined to become
increasingly smaller and more economical.

As with the codec, newer ISDN implementations will make use of
multichannel architectures. As many as eight individual
transceivers may be integrated into a single silicon chip at the
telecom provider's subscriber loop switch, and this will help to
drive down costs, and drive up availability.

Semiconductor integration will benefit users in other ways.

Future ISDN internal adapter cards (or external modems) will
feature increasing levels of integration.

Today, those units contain numerous discrete support devices-for
translating data formats between the internal PC bus and the ISDN
transceiver, for instance, or for the codec functions still
necessary to support a second, standard telephone or fax service as
a peripheral to the PC.

In the future, they will be integrated with the microcontrollers,
memory and other components that populate adapter cards into a
true, single-chip adapter card system.

Video in the Loop

What's next? Full motion video, for one thing, over standard
twisted-pair copper wiring, thanks to the "XDSL" (or X Digital
Subscriber Line) technologies: Asymmetric (ADSL), Hybrid (HDSL),
and Very-high-speed (VDSL).

In reality, a second pair of copper wires will have to be added to
the subscriber loop in order to do the job. But the result will be
well    worth the small additional infrastructure expense.

For instance, ADSL has been tested at a download rate of more than
6 Mbps, and an upload rate of 640 Kbps-faster than ISDN, and far
beyond today's common modem speeds.

Moreover, ADSL is closer than many realise, as well.

Numerous lower-speed ADSL products are already on the market.

With ADSL-and with the advances in compression made possible by
sophisticated DSP semiconductor technologies-telecom providers will
finally be able to offer high-quality movie transmissions to
residential users.

Subsequently, the subscriber loop will be enhanced again by the
addition of HDSL as a user choice.

HDSL may not offer as high a download bandwidth as ADSL, which
continues to improve as development progresses, but it will bring
symmetrical capabilities to twisted pair transmissions. This will
open the door to the possibilities of interactive movies and games,
potentially a vast market.

Along with ADSL and HDSL, will come VDSL. It may require adding a
second twisted pair to the telephone line.

Most homes already have "twisted quad" or better wiring in place,
even though they do not use it.

In new installations, savvy telecom providers are likely to use
multiple pairs in order to be prepared for the future. VDSL will
reward its implementers with a download bandwidth that could reach
52 Mbps, and upload bandwidth as high as 6 Mbps.

Bandwidth Knocking

Importantly, these and other advances in subscriber-loop
capabilities will make possible exponential increases in home-
delivered bandwidth-all over traditional twisted-pair copper
wiring.

By putting in place the infrastructure basics today-the high-speed
wide-area digital backbones, and the digital-ready subscriber-loop
switches-the world's telecom providers are preparing the way for
relatively easy upgrades to higher-bandwidth technologies, and to
added user services.

At the same time, these advances will not necessarily limit users
to a single, copper-wire transmission medium. Various cable-
oriented providers are pushing hard to gain a share of the high-
bandwidth residential/small office market via fibre-optic or hybrid
fibre/coaxial technologies.

Advances in twisted-pair technologies will prove beneficial to the
traditional telecom providers, as will their experience with
communications interactivity.

As for the cable companies, they already have the high bandwidth;
what they need is an interactive, economical "subscriber-loop"
infrastructure-just like the telecom providers.

In all probability, the users will benefit from having choices in
both technologies.

Today's analogue POTS user can migrate forward as twisted pair
bandwidth grows, and can elect to grow with POTS-or move to cable-
at points along the way that are convenient for the user, and not
dictated by industry vendors.

TELECOMMUNICATION SWITCH MANUFACTURERS STILL RULES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

While the computer manufacturers are gaining ground in
telecommunications networks under IN's advances, there should be no
mistake: the telecommunications switch manufacturer is still king.
This is because the manufacturers can use IN functions as a lever
in the sale of central office switches, and offer an entire package
that is guaranteed to work flawlessly.

Perwira Ericsson's AXE switches, currently delivered to Telekom
Malaysia, include IN functions, as did Lucent's  shipments of 5ESS
switches to Philippines' Globe Telecom. Ericsson will add AXE
switches/SDH transmission equipment to those shipped to the
Guangdong PTA by Lucent.

Telecom equipment manufacturers also win IN contracts outside of
direct switch sales. Ericsson has implemented a universal personal
telecommunications platform in Australia; and Guangdong-Nortel will
supply the Beijing Telecommunications Administration (BTA) with IN
features that build on the CCS7 network supplied previously to the
BTA.

Switch manufacturers are collaborating with computing manufacturers
too. Parts of Hewlett-Packard's (HP) OpenCall platform were used in
Nortel's ServiceBuilder architecture, and Lucent is working with HP
to jointly develop IN functions.

Switch manufacturers are also continuing to develop IN on their
own. This year, Lucent showed Advantage, an IN platform for
creation, customisation, and delivery environment of IN services
such as voice/fax mailboxes, voice activated dialling and one
number services for mixed media. Advantage serves as both SCP and
IP (see main story on page 10 for definitins) for wire line and
wireless networks; its capabilities extend from the PSTN to data
and multimedia networks.

Intelligent Gain

Siemens introduced the concept of using intelligent agents with IN
through its global advanced intelligent network (GAIN) platform.
The idea was demonstrated with a calendar manager application that
automatically arranged appointments in an electronic diary. Those
messages could also be read over the telephone.

Tandem Computers' NonStop operating kernel, and Himalaya and
Integrity IN middleware are joined by the S4000 Unix standard
servers. The company's platforms have been installed for call
processing, operations support systems and decision support.

Vying to increase its role in telecommunications, HP's  strategy
plans to serve as the hardware, operating platform and applications
middleware.

HP's OpenCall platform, released in September last year, is a bid
to do much of the same for IN. In addition to its relationships
with Nortel and Lucent, Fujitsu, Ericsson, and Nokia are some
companies offering OpenCall support.

IBM's Multiple Services Platform/6000 (MSP/6000) for business and
residential IN applications, uses the company's RISC System /6000
operating under AIX. MSP/6000 can operate as both SCP and/or IP in
the network, and is bundled with software handling voice, fax, and
data IN. MSP/6000 uses CallPath DirectTalk/6000 as a voice
peripheral for voice messages, interactive voice response, and
audiotex. Data processing adds functions such as messaging and
gateways for e-mail, and access to on-line services.

Call management provides the SSP function and manages user and
service access to the MSP/6000 node. Messaging support adds line-
based paging notification and applications interfaces to other
messaging systems.

System Integrators

Bellcore, formerly the communications research facility of the US
telcos, is one of the world's most influential AIN consulting and
engineering service companies. While Bellcore will work within the
operator's requirements, it also has its own IN/AIN service control
point system (ISCP) software. ISCP consists of SPACE (service
creation and positioning software), DRS (data and reports system,
for custom data collection and reporting), and a data distributor.

For the IP component, Bellcore has its intelligent services
peripheral, which allows voice or keyboard directions to access
complex IN functions.

The Sema Group is a major systems integrator with a global reach as
well. A large part of the company's focus is in wireless systems,
though its value added services manager (VAS Manager) provides an
IN core around which wireless and wire line services can be built.
The VAS Manager uses interactive voice response, and integrates
voice and text messaging, as well as supports wire line call
routing and wireless roaming.

The integrator has worked together with Alcatel to supply wireless
components to Indonesia's Satelindo as well.

Unisys, a hardware supplier and systems integrator, offers its A-
Series OpenFrame computers with its Network Applications Platform
(NAP) software.

For IN, NAP's VoiceSource application provides interactive voice
response. VoiceSource has been used for automated attendant,
automatic collect calling, enhanced emergency services and audio
calling directories. It has also been used for networking (such as
X.400), fax response, paging, and voice messaging services.

TINA-THE NEXT MILLENNIUM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture (TINA)
standard proposes two actions: to merge AIN (Advance Intelligent
Networks) and telecommunications network management with the
computer industry's object-oriented software and client-server
distributed computing concepts; while removing these functions from
their link to the underlying transport network.

The management aspect of TINA is handled according to the
Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) specifications.

TINA is based on an "open" computing architecture, incorporating
the Object Management Group's (OMG) common object request broker
architecture (CORBA).

CORBA is used to allow software "objects" and applications to work
together, independent of the underlying hardware and programming
language used. TINA's object definition language, for example, is a
superset of OMG's CORBA interface design language, using additional
concepts for grouping, stream interfaces and service attributes to
support real-time traffic in large networks.

Part of TINA's charter is to fill the role as the service and
management platform for ATM and multimedia broadband services. This
means managing and providing Internet services and telecom
infrastructure. TINA is meant to integrate completely into existing
wire line and wireless IN infrastructures, and is being designed to
co-exist and cooperate with all existing IN services.

Service creation in TINA will be a matter of picking and choosing
from a software object library of re-useable service components, to
which new components can be defined and added continuously.

TINA Consortium

The TINA Consortium (TINA-C) was founded in 1993 and consists of
engineers from 40 telecoms and IT companies around the world (see
Table 1). With its HQ at Bellcore's facilities in the US, TINA-C
has a five-year charter to define and validate a software
architecture that will allow communications services to be
introduced efficiently where computing, entertainment and
telecommunication industries are merging.

This year, TINA-C will evaluate, validate, and refine
specifications whose completed architecture is expected to be
presented by the end of 1997.

The TINA concept consists of several architectures; distributed
computing, service, network and management.

The computing architecture describes how software objects should be
'plugged' into the distributed processing environment. The service
architecture defines how services are provisioned, accessed, and
used. The network defines how the network resources are ordered and
used to establish end to end connections. The management
architecture gives specifications for configuring, accounting,
performance, and security.

Unlike IN, which is applied separately to each call, TINA defines
sessions which can be any number of activities to achieve a
purpose. There are several types of sessions under the service
architecture, eg. an Access Session defines the entrance into TINA
services, allowing the user to access, make requests, and retrieve
information.

Where UPT (universal personal telecommunication) exists today as a
basic form of mobility, TINA defines three different types of
mobility for future universal mobile telecommunications systems
(UMTS): Personal mobility allows a subscriber to use services
independent of their network point of attachment and specific
equipment. This feature is offered by some PABXs, which allow an
employee to sit down at any handset, punch an identifying code, and
have access to all their personal, customised features.

Terminal mobility makes use of terminals independent of the point
of attachment to the network, and exists today in the form of UPT.

Session mobility, which allows service sessions to 'follow' the
participant. This means that a subscriber could suspend a session
and resume it from a different terminal at a later time. This
allows the subscriber to request information and have it ready the
next time the service is accessed.

Figure 2 gives an example of TINA-C operating for service delivery
to users through a telecoms network. The user domain represents the
user and their terminal equipment The content domain represents
those that produce or licence content for wholesale use, such as
the film industry or multimedia information providers.

The network domain is the network operator, eg. PTT, which provides
the underlying connections to deliver the content. The retailer
domain is the brokers of information services who present and
'sell' the available information services to the consumer.

SWITCHING AWAY TO CLIENT-SERVER NETWORKS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BRIAN WASHBURN

THE Intelligent Network (IN), first thought up in the 1960s, has
gradually migrated from the telecommunications equipment
manufacturers field into the realm of computing.

In the early years, the intelligence resided in the switch. Each
switch needed a "service logic", instructing it how to process and
direct calls. This meant that with any new service introduced, the
software in each switch had to be upgraded.

As switch software became more complex, new IN features also became
riskier. In telecommunications where there was little room for
software bugs, IN services developed by telecoms switch
manufacturers often were not compatible.

A simple solution was to take the service logic away from the
switch, and place it in a central computer, which would serve the
network. The switches would thus only hold the interfaces that send
and receive information with this central computer. This developed
into the modern concept of IN.

Today, the IN market is inhabited by a mix of computing, software
and telcos. Together with telecommunications network management, it
appears that the computer manufacturers are gradually making in-
roads on a hardware basis and looking towards inheriting the rest
of the field as well.

Freephone (toll free) and premium rate services were some of the
first IN features developed using off-switch computing.

More advanced IN features  today include universal personal
telecommunications (UPT), or one number services, and virtual
private networks (VPNs). UPT introduces the concept of the mobile
terminal, routing calls by various schemes to the subscribers,
regardless of whether they are at home, at work, or travelling with
a mobile handset.

VPNs allow Centrex services to be available over the wide area
instead of on a switch by switch basis, allowing four digit
internal dialling and other features such as call hold, call
forward, and three way conferencing through the public network.

To denote the difference between the simpler IN services
(freephone) and those advanced services, the term Advanced
Intelligent Network (AIN) came into use.

AIN describes IN that gives greater control to the computer, and is
less reliant on the central office switches.

In March 1992, the ITU defined Intelligent Network Capability Set 1
(IN CS-1), which set a global standard frame work for constructing
advanced IN services and interfaces. Last year, the ITU-T completed
enhancements to CS-1. Defining additional IN capability sets (CS-2,
CS-3) under Study Group 11/Working Party 4 of the ITU-T is
progressing well, and the work is published under the Q.12XX series
of recommendations.

Components in today's IN architecture are: the service switching
point (SSP), service control point (SCP), service creation
environment (SCE), service data point (SDP), service management
system (SMS), and intelligent peripheral (IP) (see Figure 1).

The SSP is an element installed at the local exchange. When a call
requests an IN service, eg. by dialling a calling code that
accesses a freephone service, the SSP sends the request over the
signalling network to the service control point, which uses the
common channel signalling system 7 (CCS7) or other signalling
protocol. It then awaits instructions on how to handle the call.

The SCP is the "intelligence" behind the IN. It receives requests
sent by the SSPs, processes and sends a reply such as call routing
instructions back to the SSP. It does not matter how many SCPs are
in the network, or where each is located, as long as each switch
has an SCP it can access.

The SDP is another name for a database which connects and supplies
the SCP with data. Some IN services need to store a great deal of
data, eg. UPT system contains several cross-referenced phone
numbers for hundreds of thousands of customers.

The IP provides custom resources for interaction between a user and
the IN. Presently, this is voice processing coupled with services
such as speech and number recognition for wire line or wireless
networks.

The SCE and SMS are not part of the actual active services under
the IN make-up. Rather, the SCE is a design and modelling
environment to develop and test new services before loading them
onto the SCPs. The SMS handles central network management for the
SCPs, and is used to introduce and distribute new software
throughout the network.

IN, however, is not only a matter of adding intelligence to the
public network, its challenges reach far beyond the IN components
themselves.

Billing is one issue that needs to be resolved. Fortunately, IN
billing is somewhat similar to toll-operator billing. In networks
where operator assistance, call collect, and third party billing
are incorporated into the billing infrastructure and eventually
find their way onto the subscriber's invoice, adding IN support is
another step in the same direction.

IN requires capturing information and adding the charges to
subscriber invoices. Many current billing systems are inflexible
and must be modified to accommodate the more complex IN, especially
when services like usage-based IN service metering are introduced.
Additionally, the IN equipment needs some sort of accountability to
generate reports.

Things become even more complex when multiple network services are
involved. UPT that incorporates cellular, wire line, paging, and
other types of terminal devices operated by different PTT branches
or operators can create a billing nightmare.

The technical counterpart to the headache is in tying existing
voice and fax messaging, interactive voice response, and other
network elements into the IN.

But perhaps the most difficult issue is that IN obstacles do not
end on technical matters: Which branch is responsible for the IN
functions and the customer? How does the PTT determine the revenue
split from services that span across another operating unit's
resources, and across different networks? These concerns are joined
by regulatory issues-where a PTT's operations may not be authorised
to operate "bundled" wire line, cellular, and paging services.

Another area of potential trouble, but one of great potential
benefit as well, is in testing how new IN features may interact
with existing IN.

For example, combining UPT with VPN service to allow business
professionals to dial in to a home office from anywhere may be a
very valuable feature for some businesses. This sort of service
would allow an employee to call the company's freephone number,
give a security identification, enter their present telephone
number and forward all business calls to their location.

NEW GIGASWITCH/IP: SIMPLE, COST EFFECTIVE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY GRAEME K. LE ROUX

EARLIER this year we looked at the state of play with ATM.

We suggested that, while the ATM standards set was coming along
nicely, deploying a real ATM network was still fraught with more
than a few problems.

While much work has been done since then, ATM is still something
the average network manager is best advised to treat as a spectator
sport if at all possible; but the game is getting more interesting.

Practical Advance

Perhaps the most practical advance in ATM has been recently
introduced by US-based Ipsilon in partnership with Digital in the
form of ATM-based IP Switching technology.

This is probably the first generally useful application of ATM.

It is, perhaps, more than a little ironic that IP Switching as
exhibited by the Digital GigaSwitch/IP is in effect, a method of
turning an ATM network into a single logical IP router.

Remember the hype about ATM marking the beginning of the end of the
router?

Ipsilon's technology differs significantly from other ATM-based
routing solutions which have been less than impressive.

The ATM-based router "solutions" which have been released by
several vendors, have simply been various methods of connecting one
or more "fat pipes" to a traditional router.

Ordinary IP traffic is broken into cells, transmitted with varying
degrees of reliability across an ATM network, and  reassembled into
the original IP packets.

This should not be confused with the process of de-fragmentation
which IP routers do not perform.

The reassembled cells are then routed in the traditional manner
using information propagated with ordinary routing protocols such
as RIP or OSPF.

Build a network of, say, five routers using this type of technology
and all you are doing is substituting ATM interfaces-one per
router-and an ATM switch for ordinary high speed serial interfaces-
four per router.

Such a network behaves in exactly the same way whether you use
serial interfaces or ATM, provided you do not flood the ATM switch
in which case cells are dropped.

There is no solid data on what happens if you do flood the ATM
switch in a situation like this because nobody has tried it yet in
the real world.

It is possible that your expensive ATM switch might turn into a
random fault generator and the five routers (or the end stations
connected to them), would then spend a lot of time reconfiguring
themselves around the "faulty" links through the ATM network and
trying to retransmit data.

On the other hand, the routers might throttle back transmitting
stations via normal IP mechanisms.

This would leave the ATM switch with the inter-router traffic
generated by the routing protocol in use-that is a much smaller
load.

In this case, it would recover, enabling it to provide reliable
links once more and, in turn, permitting the routing algorithms to
converge.

Which of these scenarios actually occurs would depend upon the
equipment in use, the nature of the IP traffic between the routers,
the performance of the IP's flow control mechanisms, the
intelligence of the router's ATM interfaces, and so forth.

Would the network recover or not?

Flip a coin or better yet buy the network described above, try it
and send us an e-mail; we'd love to know.

Avoids Problems

Ipsilon and Digital's approach avoids the potential problems in the
scenario described above in two ways.

First, Digital's Gigaswitches are designed such that no possible
combination of ports can exceed the back plane bandwidth of the
switch which, when combined with their non-blocking ATM flow
control algorithms, all but eliminates dropped cells.

Second, Ipsilon treats the whole ATM network as a single router
which extends, in the example outlined above, to five separate
locations and not a network of discrete routers.

As a result there are no convergence issues-OSPF, RIP, and so forth
are intended to work between routers, not within them.

If you were to interconnect five GigaSwitch/IP-based networks
(let's say, five large university campuses) via 10 links (standard
DDN links, for example), you would have precisely the same
convergence issues which you have right now -ATM would not come
into it.

Target Market

The GigaSwitch/IP is aimed at Internet Service Providers or large
campus sites.

It is significantly cheaper than any comparable solution based on
standard routers.

All this is made possible by the remarkably simple-at least in
concept-idea of looking at the nature of an incoming IP packet.

If an incoming IP packet is something short,  let's say a DNS look
up, then a routing decision is made and an SVC is set up within the
ATM network by the Ipsilon software.

The packet is broken up into ATM cells, transmitted via the SVC,
the SVC is torn down, the packet reassembled and transmitted out of
the destination port of the "router". This is a slow process. The
SVC set up and tear down is, however, not significant and neither
is the process of packet disassembly and re-assembly.

It is the routing decision which takes the time-this is what
prohibits the average "ATM-capable" router from working much faster
than the same device connected to a serial interface.

The interesting part is that only about 10 per cent of IP packets
fit this category of a "short" transmission.

Ninety per cent of IP traffic is a stream of several packets such
as a file transfer, Web page hit, and so forth. For this sort of
traffic, there is no point in setting up and then tearing down
SVCs.

This means that after the first packet is processed, you have a
virtual point-to-point link within the ATM network which is, in
this case, the router.

If you have a point-to-point link between the source and
destination ports in your router, you do not need to make a routing
decision on the rest of the packets in the stream. This means that
you can bypass the router's decision making engine.

The result is an improvement in throughput of several hundred
percent at little, if any, extra cost.

A six-slot GigaSwitch/IP costs less than US$60,000 and has a
maximum throughput of 5.3 million packets per second. This makes it
better than five times that of an average high-end router, which is
likely to cost almost double the price.

Another practical application for ATM which has developed nicely
over the last year or so is the use of ATM as a backbone within a
campus environment.

Using ATM as a campus backbone boils down to using it to
interconnect hubs within discrete areas, usually of departmental
size (say 250 plus users), of a campus. In this mode, ATM can
integrate data, voice and video services, but only for very large
sites due to the cost of the necessary high-end equipment.

Such equipment is still only available from vendors like Nortel-
although some traditional IT vendors such as IBM, which with the
high end of their Nways product line, are making inroads into this
market. As a data only solution based on PVCs, campus ATM backbones
are now relatively cost effective- even where the "campus" is a
large building.

This is particularly so when one looks at the cost of managed
ports, the ATM application used by most sites.

In addition, the advantages of ATM, such as extending VLANs beyond
a single hub, are other cost-effective factors that work in ATM's
favour.

VLANs in and of themselves are not generally of major interest to
the average network manager.

Capabilities of VLANs

However, the sort of capabilities they provide such as load
balancing across collision domains, isolating various types of
traffic or categories of users, logically distributing server-based
applications while physically centralising equipment, are
persuasive arguments for deploying systems with a VLAN capability.

For example, a university might wish to isolate student, research
staff and administrative traffic.

A VLAN built on an ATM backbone would permit each group to be
assigned a logically separate, campus-wide, network.

An interconnection between these networks could be made, for
example at some convenient central point via any appropriate
combination of routers and firewalls.

Such a network would need only a single media link, such as
ordinary multi-mode fibre, between each building in the campus,
perhaps similar links within larger buildings, and a series of VLAN
capable, hubs-DECHub 900s, 3Com sONCore or Bay 5000 are some
possibilities.

These could be connected either directly or via some form of third
party concentrator to the ATM backbone.

In the case of hubs, like the DECHub, which have tight integration
between their back plane VLAN capability and that of their options,
this requires the simple inclusion of an ATM switch option in the
hub.

VLANs created within the hub's backplane or option modules can be
extended across the ATM network with no more effort than
configuring the original VLAN.

In the case of hubs which do not have such tight integration, the
VLAN is created within the hub and a router option added.

This router is then connected to the ATM network in such a way that
the ATM network appears as several discrete logical ports.

This leads to the potential for the situation described in the
example above in reference to the potential for convergence
problems with routing algorithms.

Maximum Bandwidth

However, since the maximum bandwidth between the routers and the
maximum throughput of the routers is known (as we have maximum
performance figures for the routers and we would be working in a
campus environment where device latencies are either known or can
be easily measured) we could build such a network with sufficient
excess capacity to make the probability of flooding any one ATM
switch very low- not eliminate it, just make it very low.

Alternatively we could deploy a campus backbone in the form of a
device using Ipsilon's IP switching technology or something
similar, when such competitive products become available.

Digital may be the first to market this sort of technology but it
is unlikely that they will be the last.

In most other areas there has been little practical change in the
state of play with ATM.

LAN emulation continues to underwhelm anyone who looks at it too
closely, wide area ATM services are still mainly experimental and
of debatable cost efficiency to either the carriers or their
customers, and carrier level backbone ATM is still looking like a
world of static PVCs.

There is also the question of deployment time frames versus
standards developments.

In the wide area, carriers plan in terms of five, 10 or 15 years
for major changes to their networks and recovering the cost of such
changes.

In a campus environment, a carrier's customers typically require a
minimum of two to three years to recover the cost of new equipment.

Changing Standards

Standards change significantly within 12 months and such changes
require expensive upgrades or straight replacement of equipment.

ATM will not find the sort of general acceptance that technologies
such as ISDN, FDDI, or 100Base-T have.

On the other hand if, or when, the benefits of VLANs based on ATM,
Ipsilon/Digital's implementation of IP switching, or some other
generally useful application of ATM technology, find favour with
and are deployed by, a significant section of the market, the
process of standards development will slow to a more economically
expectable pace.

Stay tuned. The ATM World Series is far from over.

FORUM ON VOICE IN ATM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

ATM for carriers: Is it real? According to Norman Gale, Nortel's
director of Magellan marketing, Asia-Pacific, the ATM forum's
discussions on ATM Adaption Layer (AAL) should be of interest to
telcos.

Said Gale, "To enable voice over ATM more efficeintly, the new AAL
6 is being proposed to code voice channels."

AAL 6 examines the streaming of multiple channels into ATM cells
and according to Gale, it is addressing two issues: Packing cell
density and minimising delay (echo cancellation).

"This will solve the issue of narrowband-to-broadband
internetworking," adds Gale.

Overall, the ATM wave in the Asia-Pacific is still in the testing
stages and according to Gale, it is in the backbone services that
ATM should figure prominently at the initial stages.

In the Enterprise market, Nortel is working on its ATM technologies
with Fore Systems.

Gale sees at the moment, 34 Mbps ATM may be next step for the WAN
market, which is increasingly being driven by newer technologies
like Frame Relay.

BAY TARGETS ACCESS EDGE MARKET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

BAY Networks is banking on the recent growth in the Internet and
Intranet markets to capitalise on an emerging need in the
telecommunications market.

At the recent Partnersphere Executive Conference held in Bali,
Bruce Sachs, executive vice president and general manager of Bay's
Internet/Telecom Access business unit, revealed that Bay is
targeting the access edge of service providers.

Said Sachs, "With our Baystream product, we can do both Routing and
Frame Relay (FR) switching on the same hardware, so that it is
possible to build one large network that provides both FR access
and leased-line routing or dial-up connections to the Internet."

Sachs added that this was useful due to the competitive nature of
service provision where the price of connectivity is becoming more
and more of a commodity. A network that offers both services will
then lower the cost of ownership for the provider.

With the recent acquisitions of Lancity, a cable TV modem vendor
and Penril's DSP modem business, Bay is now offering a software-
driven access architecture that is scalable and lower priced to
boot. Sachs sees personal video-conferencing as an application that
is beginning to take off here.

Said Sachs, "We again, have the ability to provide multiple
services from one hardware platform with software upgrade, thus
lowering costs and ownership."

Bay also sees an opportunity in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), in
the telecommunications sphere.

Based on their experience US-based Concentric Networks, (which has
VPNs in Europe and are looking for links in the Asia-Pacific), Bay
is confident that on-line services like interactive games and
banking will make an impact in the region.

Addressing the need of product differentiation by ISPs, Sachs
explained that Bay could offer ISPs a VPN solution that makes it
possible to attain a guaranteed QoS to their customers.

PHILIPS THROWS DOWN GAUNLET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

You get a new phone if yours does not work. This is the claim from
Philips three months after it introduced its first GSM phone
(Fizz). Philips has launched a line-up of new products as part of
its new aggressive marketing to capture market share.

In line with its aim to reach a 20 per cent penetration in the
Asia-Pacific markets, Philips has unveiled the First Choice
Programme, an extensive customer service support that guarantees,
in the event that your cellular phone fails to function, it will be
replaced within 24 hours, anywhere in the world.

Said Simon Roper, GM of Philips Consumer Communications (PCC) in
Asia-Pacific, "This is good for customers as they can use another
phone right away and distributor need not bother with an angry
customer. It will also be beneficial for operators as it minimises
their network losses."

Added Roper, "Our objective is to become one of the top three
manufacturers in consumer telephony by the year 2000."

The new products include the Spark GSM phone, boasting the longest
talk and standby time and offers a duo sim concept.

Said Roper, "The duo sim concept allows either a full sized SIM
card or a plug-in card to address the concerns of celluar users
today." Chalk one up for Philip's strategy to lure customers from
its competitors?

Other members of the product line include the Fizz Etac phone, two
new pagers, and a new DECT cordless phone, the Xalio.

For mobile data communications, there are now two new cards
available, the Mobile Data Card and the Twin Data Card.

Unique in the Twin Data Card is the option to switch between
cellular network and the PSTN via an adapter that allows normal
phone jack connection.

The new lineup will be manufactured in Singapore.

ORBCOMM SERVICES FOR ASIA REGION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Subscribers in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei can use Orbcomm's
global 2-way messaging from 1998 onwards once Malaysia-based TRI
completes its US$8 million gateway late next year.

With twenty-six satellites  scheduled for launch next year, Orbcomm
users can send and receive real-time messages anywhere in the world
with US$1000 hand-held units equipped with GPS, LCD screen and
keypad.

The cost of this service, said Alan Parker, president of Orbcomm
must be close to the paging level for Orbcomm to succeed.

However, the larger market, said Parker, would  come from
industrial users, transportation and the search and rescue
services. For Malaysia, TRI believes that the main business would
come from tracking and data messaging services.

Added Parker, "The total market is divided into two basic user
types: machine-to-machine applications fro tracking and monitoring
where a sensor initiates the communication, and personal
communications services where an individual initiates the
communication."

Parker estimated the total market to be worth about 168 million
subscriber units with a third of the demand coming from Asia.

NEW ISSUES FOR NEW NETWORKS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEN CHONG

The installation of full service networks (FSN) has thrown up
several new issues in test and measurements for service operators.

FSNs are networks set up to carry digital voice, video and data
traffic as well as establish a foundation for the future
interactive multimedia services much bandied about now. However,
according to Tektronix, cable TV operators learning to offer voice
services and traditional telcos who are going big with VOD are
encountering new issues when installing their core and access
networks.

Said Linc Reed-Nickerson, product marketing manager, Transmission
Test, Tektronix: "New services create new problems. Cable operators
and telcos understand their traditional services well, but they now
must learn how to optimise for new services."

FSNs are mostly based on the broadband Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy (SDH) technology, including new installations in China,
with architectures based mostly on a hybrid fibre/coax physical
media.

Tektronix says that the digital signal now contains a complex mix
of voice, video and data traffic which causes problems in the
transmission, if the test and measurement equipment used during
installation and regular maintenence of the network are not
sophisticated enough to capture and analyse the signals.

Compounding the difficulties is the fact that ATM and MPEG-2 are
the technologies providing video transport on SDH networks. MPEG-2
drop-outs are especially noticeable.

Said Reed-Nickerson, "In the analogue world, you could judge
picture quality from the video picture. In the digital world,
degradation sets in immediately, not gradually. The picture just
goes away suddenly."

A whole new barrage of tests are now essential, said Reed-
Nickerson. Timing and synchronisation tests are vital because of
the hybrid SDH/PDH networks and the fact that video and ATM-based
voice require high quality timing.

Jitter and wander test functions are now also essential to maintain
service quality measurements.Tektronix says that low frequency
jitter causes video subcarrier phase shift which causes colour loss
in the video.

In addition, hybrid analogue-digital systems produce distortions
associated with purely analogue systems. Some of these distortions
include composite triple beat, composite second order, cross
modulation and ingress. Newly introduced measurement devices, such
as Tektronix' Tek 2715 allow the pin-pointing of all such
distortions.

Operators also need to know that better indicators of signal
quality have to be used. For example, using raw Bit Error Rate is a
better indicator of system performance problems than using the
corrected BER.

Understanding the FSN is increasing at a steady pace in Asia. Said
Reed-Nickerson, "Last year operators asked about access network
testing only. Now questions about core network installation have
surfaced. It is an indication of the new digital services being
deployed such as ISDN and compressed voice."

LOW-DENSITY MARKET A FERTILE GROUND?

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

Wireless is undoubtedly the "in" technology of this decade. The
many cellular networks are testimony to the effective
infrastructure that it provides. However, the low-density market is
undermining its cost efficiency.

According to Steve Chen, vice-president, marketing of Celcore,
operators are able to achieve revenue targets from urban networks
due to the optimisation from the large number of subscribers. In
the rural market, operators have been reluctant to offer
sophisticated services.

Said Chen, "The low-density market may not be profitable as the
system may not be optimised."

In fact, most operators offset the costs by charging their urban
subscribers a higher price.

Celcore has identified the potential of the low-density market and
offers a solution for operators.

Taking a cue from the client-server (network centric) model in the
computing industry, Celcore offers a distributed network approach
to deliver wireless services without backhauling other networks.

The Globalhub from Celcore is an intelligent network platform that
functions as the Authorisation and Call Routing Equipment (ACRE) in
a cellular system (through IS-41) to offer advanced personal
mobility services and one-number access.

In addition, Celcore's Globalsystem product family supports
protocols like AMPS, ETACS, GSM and PCS and enables carriers to
tailor their networks according to the number of subscribers.

Said Chen, "We are evolving digital interfaces to support CDMA and
TDMA as well."

Leverage

With a regional office already in India, Celcore's latest venture
was a partnership with Thailand's UCOM, which, according to Chen,
will leverage on the latter's experience in system implementation
in the region.

The agreement calls for Celcore to offer turnkey solutions to
wireless operators as well as introducing UCOM as a potential
operating partner. In addition, Celcore has entered the Indonesian
market with a contract to expand Komselindo's AMPS network.

AT&T COMMITTED TO INDIA'S TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SHIRISH NADKARNI

IN the wake of the corruption controversy embracing former
telecommunications minister Pandit Sukh Ram, there are serious
doubts  whether the telecom tenders approved by the former minister
will be allowed to go through. But John Legere, president of Asia-
Pacific for the American telecom giant AT&T, has no doubt that the
projects which have already been taken up will be undisturbed.

#APT: Why hasn't AT&T done much in the long-distance telephony
segment  in India?

Legere: You may know that AT&T is a founder-member of the World
Partners Association (WPA), which is an alliance of carriers. Most
Asian PTTs are members of this alliance; and we are trying to
convince Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), the country's
overseas telecommunications arm, to become a part of it. VSNL is an
entity most suitable to serve our multi- national customers in
India, so we are looking at a partnership with it.

Once it is part of the WPA, we can work together towards seamlessly
serving the global needs of Indian customers, and also serving our
multinational customers in India. We will offer private line Frame
Relay and PTN services.

APT: But aren't there other similar alliances like, for example,
Global One?#

Legere: There is Global One, there is Concert. The model they offer
is more of an invest-when-you-can, ally-when-you-have-to type.
WPA's success has been substantial in Asia, where carriers have
felt threatened by other alliances, and have wanted to bind
together. We feel we have a formula that is best for VSNL and
India.

APT: Why has AT&T  missed the bus, as far as basic services are
concerned?

Legere: We had studied the Indian market for a full 18 months
before we bid for basic services in the telecom circles which
offered, from our  point of view, the most potential.

We contacted more than 10,000 customers, and did a massive amount
of technological research on Indian requirements. Even our bids in
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Karnataka were pretty aggressive-
perhaps more aggressive than any other multinational player.

But we didn't get the circles we wanted, and those were the only
ones we were prepared to bid for. Now that they are gone, we will
concentrate on wireless services in the two states we have and
establish our brand and service in India.

APT: Have you faced any major obstacles in the cellular arena?#

Legere: Well, we are definitely concerned about the allocation of
frequencies, and we have made these concerns known to the
authorities. They are urgent, day-to-day problems, but they have
not slowed us down. We are still on schedule to start our services
by Christmas. Meanwhile, we are optimistic that, if the government
has said it will address the problems we are facing, it will stick
to its word.

APT: Why has AT&T chosen to concentrate outside the US?

Legere: Look at it from the opposite side. Five years ago, India
did not even figure among the top 50 countries in the world, in
terms of usage of telecom services. Now the traffic out of this
country is expanding by leaps and bounds, and it is already in the
top 20.

We have estimated that, by  2005, India will be one of the three
biggest traffic streams to the US. Once the tele-density in India
and China grows, the traffic streams will be unparalleled and we
want to be part of the action.

APT: For the future, which other countries are you looking at,
especially in Asia?#

Legere: We have a thoughtful, focussed and aggressive globalisation
strategy; and have targeted countries we wish to go into. Apart
from India, we are building infrastructure in Canada and the UK.

So far as Asia is concerned, our largest investments are in India,
where we have made a commitment of US$1.5 billion. Our other major
investment in cellular services is in Hong Kong, where we have a
venture called Smartone.

We are also significantly expanding our on-line services in Asia.
We have advanced services delivered through the Internet in Hong
Kong, Japan and Australia. India is potentially a huge market for
Internet services, and if those licences are given out, we will
definitely be interested.

We are looking to bid in several other Asian countries, like
Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia, all of which
provide major opportunities. However, you must appreciate that we
have to pick and choose the places where we want to have major
investments; and, in Asia, we have consciously chosen India.

PLDT JOINS THE PHILIPPINE INTERNET BANDWAGON

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) has taken
control of the Philippines' leading Internet Service Provider
(ISP)-an event greeted with dismay by ISPs and subscribers wary of
PLDT's embrace.

Infocom Technologies,  which claims 60 per cent of the Philippines'
infant Internet market, elected a PLDT man, Renato Gendrano,
president and CEO in September. Gendrano said the new owners wanted
to "accelerate the growth of Infocom's Internet business". Their
vision was to build a second Internet Backbone and to make the Net
more accessible.

Gendrano announced that Infocom intends to install 200 new digital
lines to give dial-up users faster access to the Net. He also said
Infocom would launch new products such as Philippine-wide roaming
access through a 1-800 number; e-mail to paging capability and pre-
paid Internet cards for international access. Funding will be
generated by the capital markets, loans and direct capital infusion
from PLDT.

Infocom subscribers access the Net via an E1 gateway with a speed
of 2.048 Mbps , the fastest and largest among all ISPs. Infocom
claims 3,000 direct subscribers. Add to this the subscribers
brought in by its 16 resellers and Infocom's total subscriber base
amounts to around 20,000.

Infocom expects this base to increase 15 per cent by end-1996.
Gendrano said Infocom is targeting an astounding 400 per cent
growth in 1997.

Small Slice of Pie

Whatever the real number of subscribers, the size of the
Philippines' Internet subscriber pie is far too small for the
booming number of ISPs. Industry estimates place the total number
of ISPs at an astonishing 79. In contrast, there were some 22 ISPs
last March and only 6 in August 1995.

About four-fifths of these ISPs are resellers who sell access to
the Net but who do not necessarily have all the hardware and
services of a major ISP. Both resellers and major ISPs are fighting
for a market estimated from 40,000 to about 100,000 subscribers.

Industry sources estimated the number of Net users at only 15,000
last March and expected this to double at year-end.

Internet access rates in the Philippines are cheap and the intense
competition is expected to drive prices down even further.

Executive Power Centre rocked the industry early this year by
offering access at only P90 (US$3) per hour and the same rate for
every succeeding hour. Infocom charges individual subscribers a low
P800 (US$30) per month and corporate subscribers P50,000 (US$1,900)
per month for leased connections. ISPs charge a one-time connection
fee that ranges from P90 to P50,000.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MUSCLES INTO PHILIPPINES TELECOM PIE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY PETER GALACE

DEUTSCHE Telekom has become a key player in the intensely
competitive Philippine telecoms industry with its equity
acquisition in Isla Telecommunications (Islacom).

Islacom is a CMTS and IGF operator lagging in its commitment to
install 700,000 telephone landlines by 1998.

DT becomes Islacom's second strategic partner after Thailand's
Shinawatra International.

Islacom Stake

Sources in Philippine telecoms speculate that DT will acquire a 20
per cent stake in Islacom at the expense of Shinawatra, which now
controls 30 per cent.

The remaining 70 per cent is held by Asia Communications Holdings
(Asiacom), a Filipino company controlled by the Delgado family.

Islacom has so far refused to confirm the extent of DT's equity
stake.

Islacom only acknowledges that it had entered into a "technical
partnership" with DT.

Simeon Kintanar, commissioner of the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC) said DT is infusing both equity and technology
into Islacom.

Kintanar attended the signing of the joint venture agreement
between DT and Islacom in early September.

At press time, the signing ceremony was to have taken place in
Manila.

Islacom was identified by the NTC, the government agency that
regulates Philippine telecoms, as one of six companies lagging in
its LEC commitments as of the first half of the year.

Islacom has an obligation to install 130,000 landlines in 1996 and
443,000 landlines in 1997.

The company estimates that it will need P25 billion (US$1 billion)
for its LEC project in the next five years.

Following the signing of the joint venture agreement, DT advanced
US$40 million for Islacom's LEC roll-out programme and cellular
operations.

Industry observers say Islacom sought a second strategic partner
because Shinawatra is unable to extend the capital requirements
needed by Islacom projects in the next 10 years.

Islacom also has a licence for paging operations, but is not
actively engaged in this service.

Sources say DT may have cast its lot with Islacom because the
latter's LEC service area is one of the most lucrative in the
Philippines.

Cebu City is acknowledged as the Manila of the south and is
experiencing an economic boom.

Islacom's LEC service area in southern Philippines includes Cebu,
Mandaue, Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, Siquijor, Samar,
Leyte, Iloilo, Bacolod, Bohol, Aklan, Antique, Capiz and Guimaras.

Lucent Agreement

The company recently signed a US$43 million agreement with Lucent
Technologies Philippines (an AT&T subsidiary) for its LEC project
and the improvement of its international gateway switch.

Islacom is one of five Philippine CMTS (cellular mobile telephone
service) providers.

It is ranked either fourth or fifth in the number of subscribers
and it has 40,000 subscribers to date.

BINARIANG AIMS FOR FULL SPECTRUM OF SATELLITE SERVICES IN ASIA-PACIFIC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEE-KAY SEN

MALAYSIA will launch its second satellite Measat-2 into orbit on
Nov 13.

It will be placed into the 148 degrees east orbital slot while
Measat-1 is currently positioned at 91.5 degrees   east.

"By putting Measat-2 at 148 degrees east, the footprints of the
satellites will be extended up to east Australia and Hawaii,"
Binariang's senior manager Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid said in Kuala
Lumpur recently.

Besides Malaysia, the footprints of both satellites will cover
Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. Binariang
is the owner and operator of the two satellites and has three
orbital slots.

Arianespace has been chosen to launch the satellite from the
European space port in Kourou, French Guiana. Both satellites are
manufactured by Hughes.

The second satellite has been flown to Kourou, where it will be
tested before being encapsulated into the Arianespace launch
vehicle, Ariane 44L, for launching. The launch vehicle will have a
co-passenger, Arabsat.

Additional Equipment

Additional equipment and a ground antenna is being installed at the
Langkawi control centre to accommodate Measat-2 as it will be in a
different orbital slot.

Binariang has invested RM600 million (US$235.8 million) for the
manufacturing and launching of the two satellites as well as ground
facilities.

Achieving breakeven for both satellites is expected to be in less
than five years.

Halim said besides leasing transponders, Binariang was aiming to
provide a full spectrum of satellite services with both the
satellites in orbit.

Binariang is considering providing Vsat (very small aperature
terminal) services by next year. It recently teamed-up with Hughes
to provide the terminals.

This is in line with providing rural telephony which can be linked
to the PSTN, via the satellite. Halim said this mode is more cost
effective as operational costs are lower.

Binariang is also forging alliances and partnerships with
international satellite and broadcasting players in the region to
lease satellite transponders.

Binariang is also considering launching Measat-3 by 1998, which
will be a much bigger satellite than Measat-1 and 2. Details are
being worked out but Binariang is aiming to provide global coverage
and a lot more capacity.

All the 15-Ku band transponders have been leased to its affiliate
company Measat Broadcast Network.

The affiliate recently launched the country's first 23-channel
satellite television and radio network known as Astro (All Asian
Television and Radio Company). Measat Broadcast Network hopes to
target 1 million subscribers (20 per cent market share) by year
2000.

It is anticipated that there will be five million homes with
television sets in the country by then.

More than 80 per cent of Measat Broadcast Network's revenue will
come from subscription fees with the remaining 15 per cent through
the sale of air time.

Measat Broadcast Network will levy an RM80 (US$31.44) monthly
charge for the 23 digital satellite TV and eight radio channels.
This is in addition to the one-off installation and equipment
charge of RM1,680 (US$660.24), which includes the satellite dish,
digital satellite receiver (DSR), remote control and smart card to
be purchased by subscribers directly from Philips, which has
exclusive rights.

Measat Broadcast Network needs an average of 700,000 subscribers to
breakeven.

"We can reach that figure in two and a half to three years' time,"
Measat Broadcast Network's chief operating officer, Paul Edwards
said, after the launch of Astro in Kuala Lumpur on Sep 25.

Measat Broadcast Network has so far invested RM500 million
(US$196.5 million) and intends to invest an additional RM500
million to expand Astro's broadcasting and production complex, the
All Asian Broadcasting Centre (ABC) and programming as well. Astro
will offer its services to neighbouring countries by early 1997,
Edwards added.

DTU Service

The direct-to-user (DTU) service can be made available to 30
million subscribers in India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia,
Taiwan and east Australia. However, Singapore is  not too keen on
the DTV service being aired within as it already has its own cable
TV network.

The Astro service is also an interactive multimedia platform
capable of delivering services such as home banking and shopping,
stock exchange information and Internet access as well. These
services will be introduced next year.

DSC DIPS IN THE FACE OF ORDER SLOWDOWN

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BENNY TAN

The stock of DSC Communications, a designer, developer,
manufacturer and marketer of digital switching, transmission,
access and private network system products, took a big plunge after
the company said its latest quarter results will not meet analysts'
estimates because of order slowdown and an inventory writeoff.

DSC's shareprice is currently at about US$17: Down more than 70 per
cent after a high of US$60 last year. Revenues are expected to be
at about US$330 million, with earnings at about breakeven. Wall
Street analysts are expecting US$0.24 a share. A year ago, earnings
were US$49.4 million or US$0.42 a share on sales of US$370 million.

Disappointing product sales included the Litespan-120, an
international loop access product and iMTN, a next-generation
digital cross connect. DSC is also taking an after-tax charge of
US$60 million to write off wireless products that cannot be used
because of interference with military equipment, as well as payment
for restructuring.

Last month, Alcatel won a contract with Motorola, beating out DSC.

Earnings are expected to be lower due to:

Lower revenues from Litespan sales driven by a drop in linecard
sales even though infrastructure sales increased.

Lower revenues from transport products, specifically for
traditional cross-connects due to purchase delays by customers.

Lower gross margins due to lower volume and a shift in product mix
in the Litespan area, from high margin linecards to lower margin
infrastructure.

Lower than expected initial demand for new products including
Airspan and iMTN.

Intelligent Service

DSC recently clinched a multi-million dollar contract to supply IXC
Communications, a suite of intelligent network equipment, including
its intelligent service peripheral (ISP), which combines features
of both service control points and intelligent peripherals.

The systems will allow IXC to offer 800/888 services, call routing
and customised account codes to subscribers.

New Advanced Solutions

DSC's new products which were demonstrated at the NCF InfoVision
'96 tradeshow included switched digital video (SDV), an application
enabling carriers to offer a variety of new interactive digital
video applications, including movies-on-demand, home shopping and
distance learning services.

Other new products in the access area are the Litespan 2000, 2012
and the Litecraft. Switching products include the iMPAX 5420 and
iMPAX 5001.

DSC also  demonstrated a portfolio of narrowband, wideband and
broadband transmission products including digital cross-connects
and transcoders.

MUTIARA'S PROGRESS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

MUTIARA Telecommunications is coming along strongly with its plans
to be a more aggressive player.

This follows its partnership with Swiss Telecom.

Mutiara sprung a surprise announcement recently when it revealed
its plan to tie up with 60 property developers to offer domestic
and international services.

The tie up is expected to take place over the next two years.

These services will be provided to new development sites in the
country.

Mutiara marked its entry by recently signing up with the first
developer, Bukit Tinggit Resort.

Earlier, Mutiara had announced that its priority was to set up its
international gateway first.

It is believed that this gateway will be operational soon.

After it sets up its international gateway, Mutiara intends to
offer a fixed network service.

To date, Binariang is in the lead with 111 contracts. Other players
include Telekom Malaysia with 69 contracts and Celcom with less
than 60.

CELCOM IN SABAH

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

CELCOM has been awarded two contracts valued at RM74 million (US$29
million) for the implementation of a 2,000 km fibre-optic network
in Sabah.

The fibre-optic cable will be installed within the transmission
grid of the Sabah Electricity Board.

The two companies which will lay the cables and provide equipment
are Uniphone and Teknolite. Uniphone is a fibre-optic cable
supplier.

Celcom has formed a joint venture company- Celcom Timur (Sabah)-
with the Sabah state government via Warisan Harta. Work on the
project will commence soon and is scheduled to be completed in a
year's time.

The project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will
cover 696 km including a 19 km long submarine network, while the
second phase will cover the remaining 794 km.

Celcom is the first company to set up a comprehensive fibre-optic
network spanning the state. It has a similar arrangement with
Sarawak Electricity Corp (SESCO) in the state of Sarawak.

TRI ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO STOP RAMPANT SHARE SPECULATION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEE-KAY SEN

IN September, wild speculation surrounding Technology Resources
Industries (TRI) led to its share price taking a severe beating.
The counter registered the year's low of RM6.05 (US$2.38) on Sep
24-a 30 per cent fall in its share price.

Two days later, a foreign newspaper reported that TRI's deal with
Deutsche Telekom (DT) could hit a snag, further dampening the weak
sentiment. This coincided with speculation that DT had doubts over
TRI's prospects in an already overcrowded, highly competitive
sector. TRI refuted within the same day saying it would formalise
its deal with DT in October, thereby quieting rumours of its
troubled DT deal. TRI disclosed that it had signed the Management
Agreement, and Technical Assistance and Training Agreement with DT,
signifying DT's ready participation in TRI.

TRI executives are denying the allegation, but those close to the
deal revealed that DT had requested for a re-negotiation. DT has,
however, kept silent over the matter. A research analyst said DT
did not want to be left out of the booming Asian telecommunications
business and was keen to establish a foothold in Asia via TRI.

"It would not jeopardise its plans here just because TRI's share
price plunged. However if DT had requested for re-negotiations, it
was part of the provisions in the preliminary agreement between TRI
and DT in May  should TRI's share price come down", said the
analyst.

TRI announced on Sep 26 that it had revised the sale price per
share to be paid by DT from RM9.50 (US$3.73) to RM9.25 (US$3.64).
TRI said it will issue 68.07 million new shares which represents 10
per cent of TRI's existing paid up capital.

ING Barings analyst Soon Teck Onn commented that the price
difference was negligible and reflected DT's keenness in acquiring
a stake in TRI. DT had agreed in May to buy a 21 per cent stake in
TRI in two installments. The first installment will involve 68.07
million new TRI shares, while the second installment of the
remaining 11 per cent, will come from the existing shareholders.

Under the preliminary agreement, the price of RM9.50 (US$3.73)
could be re-negotiated if the TRI stock price slipped below RM7.46
(US$2.93) before the alliance agreement was sealed. DT will now pay
TRI RM629.64 million (US$247.45 million) for the 10 per cent stake
(or the first installment), instead of the RM646.66 million
(US$254.14 million). The entire 21 per cent transaction is tagged
at RM1.39 billion (US$546.27 million).

The remaining 11 per cent stake may be acquired by DT from TRI's
chief Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli.

VSNL ANNOUNCES US$1.27 BILLION TELECOM PLAN

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

by SHIRISH NADKARNI

BK Syngal, chairman of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (VSNL), has
announced a Rs45 billion (US$1.27 billion) programme for telecoms
during the ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002).

The plans include projects for gateway switches, earth stations,
optical fibre cable systems, information superhighway nodes, DTH
systems and network management facilities.

There are also plans for a regional submarine fibre optic cable,
OASIS, to develop India as a regional hub for telecom traffic, and
to install state-of-the-art high capacity switches at metro
centres.

VSNL has already made commitments to expand its international high
speed connectivity through SEA-ME-WE-3 and flag optical fibre
systems.

Said Syngal, "At present, there is
a shortfall of about Rs25 billion (US$704 million) in financing the
expansion plans.

"Thus, we have proposed a re-launch of our Euro-issue of global
depository receipts. The proposal has been submitted to the DoT
after approval by the VSNL board."

The organisation registered a gross income of Rs44.73 billion
(US$1.26 billion) during the financial year 1995-96, and a post-tax
profit of Rs4.09 billion (US$115 million).

Syngal called for an attitudinal change and a more focused approach
on the part of its two key state-owned partners-the DoT and the
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL)-in providing good service.

Maintenance Problems

"Although VSNL has been designated a single-window clearance agency
for leased line services, the maintenance of these lines has become
a problem because of co-ordination problems and a lack of co-
operation from the DoT and the MTNL," Syngal said.

BT LEADS ASIA-PACIFIC WITH FRAME RELAY CHARGE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

British Telecom (BT), believes that Frame Relay services (FRS) are
growing due to the need for faster data transfers and an increase
in demand for LAN interconnections at lower costs.

Last month, BT launched its FRS in Malaysia with Telekom Malaysia
(TM) selling and managing the Concert portfolio of global data
services. So far, 30 FRS customers has signed up.

According to Dr. Mohd Khir Harun, senior vice-president, major
business and government of TM, "Through this strategic alliance, we
hope to offer global communications solutions, enabling companies
in Malaysia to compete globally."

BT has FRS in 11 countries and has 600 ports installed in the
region.

Ann-Marie Leyendecker, business line manager of BT's Asia-Pacific
data network business, said that new services like LAN-dial and
ISDN access will be offered soon.

"For ISDN backup, we are rolling the infrastructure to support this
right now, so by the end of the year, we will have 2 Mbps in the
core countries and by the end of April next year, it will be
available in all the countries in Asia-Pacific."

The next generation of dial-up services, due out next year,
according to Leyendecker, wil provide direct dial-up access into
FR.

JAPAN: DEREGULATES LEASED LINES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MIKE GALBRAITH

NTT has received authorisation from the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) to lift the final restriction on
connecting leased circuits to public telephone lines.

NTT has since offered a new service for companies to connect their
leased lines to its public lines from Oct 30.

This will have a major impact on the telecom service market in
Japan, leading to increased competition and lower prices especially
in the long-distance market.

Expectations

Many large corporations can be expected to set up in-house
telephone networks and to try to sell extra capacity to outsiders:
Matsushita announced the setting up of such a network early this
year. Fujitsu and NEC are expected to make similar announcements
soon.

The ban on leasing circuits to public circuits has long been one of
the main pillars of NTT's monopoly.

Under pressure to deregulate, the MPT permitted the linking of one
end of leased circuits to the public network from April 1995 and
NTT has been charging 9,900 (US$93) a month per circuit connection.

NTT's latest initiative can be seen as a move threatening its major
rivals among the new operators-the long distance carriers DDI,
Japan Telecom and Teleway Japan.

Indeed, NTT recently also announced that it would cut the circuit
connection charges to just 1,000 (US$9.40) a month.

The long awaited 100 (US$.94) per three minute long-distance call
could quickly become a reality. NTT's price, which used to be in
the 300 (US$2.80) range, is currently 160 (US$1.50) before taking
into account discounts.

THAILAND DEFERS SIX MILLION TARGET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SUTHISAK KRAISRI

Thailand's six-million fixed-line installation programme is being
pushed back for at least two years, following the reversal of
factors brought about by the current political turnabouts.

Both TelecomAsia (TA) and Thai Telephone & Telecommunication (TT&T)
had admitted out that the project, worth over US$4 billion would
not take place until after 1998. Both organisations made the
statement stating that there are currently ample telephone lines.

"TA, (having 2.6 million lines), will not sell out all of its
telephone lines until 1998," said Supachai Chearavanont, TA's
executive director.

Adisai Bodharamik, CEO of TT&T, (whose 1.5 million lines would be
fully registered by the end of next year), said, "Once you add the
Telephone Organisation of Thailand's (TOT) yet to be installed
800,000 lines, the market will be oversupplied in the next two
years."

At the end of September, the two private fixed-line operators
delivered their combined 4.1 million lines to the TOT, as committed
in their contracts, meeting the country's target of a 10 to 100
teledensity.

In addition, Adisai believed that "repeat orders" with TT&T and TA
would be likely when the demand rises. This means that any new
players would have little chance to enter the market.

Another factor which was said to have delayed the installation
programme was line registration. Registrations fell below target
partly due to the economic slowdown during the past year. The
result was that both operators could only sell less than half of
their ready lines by the second quarter of this year.

Due to the general election this month following the House
dissolution in late September, major projects have been put on
hold. Thus, TA and TT&T are enjoying a duopoly, at least until the
turn of the century.

However, there was a price to pay: The tight Sep 30 delivery
deadline forced the two telcos to spend heavily on telephone lines
construction. As sales were below expectations, their second
quarter performance disappointed investors.

"Their sales of telephone lines was slow, even in the fisrt
quarter. This means slower gains compared to growing operating
costs," said an analyst.

Mobile Market

Meanwhile, equipment makers have been monitoring market movements.
Suppliers like Lucent are concentrating on the mobile phone market
as the pending six-million line programme "will not happen soon,"
said a Lucent senior executive.

BINARIANG RISES TO MALAYSIAN TELECOMS CHALLENGE

Binariang scotched talk that it is way behind with plans to become
Malaysia's second carrier with last week's successful launch of the
country's first telecoms satellite.

The on-schedule launch, from the European Space Agency facility in
Kourou, French Guiana, put Malaysia on a par with its neighbours in
terms of satellite TV capability and reaffirmed Binariang's commitment
to challenge the mostly government-owned Telekom Malaysia in every
sector of its business.

Binariang, which paid for the Arianespace launch, holds licences for a
cellular network, a satellite communications system, international
gateway services and a fixed network - the only Malaysian company so
endowed.

The company reckons its advanced 2-satellite system - a second Hughes
Space & Communications Co. spacecraft will be lofted in the middle of
the year - will give it the technological muscle to beat the best
telecoms service providers at home and abroad.

The first of the satellites has 5 high power Ku-band transponders and
12 C-band transponders which will give Binariang the capacity for 40
digital TV channels, 8 digital radio channels, a GSM cellular system
and the digital firepower to fulfil its domestic and international
telecoms aspirations.

Binariang - controlled by Malaysian oil, gaming and property tycoon
Ananda Krishnan - will beam only TV programming approved by the
government. Except for Singapore, Malaysia is now the only Southeast
Asian country that outlaws satellite TV.

Legislation is passing through parliament to change the law so that
Binariang can beam into Malaysian homes - and those beyond. But there
is no legislation that will help Binariang beat the 7 other companies
muscling for a slice of the telecoms market in Malaysia.

Competitors say that because Binariang has been late in getting its
fully digital GSM cellular network up and running, the company has made
it easier for less worthy competitors to resist government attempts to
force mergers in the overcrowded industry. Because of the late GSM
start-up, Binariang is now competing in a 5-way battle for the 600,000
or so Malaysians that own mobile phones (See APTA July 17).

Late last year Binariang was at pains to deny claims from competitors
that it was behind schedule with its roll out of services. Said Donald
Swan, Binariang's chief operations officer: "If you launch 4 lines of
business on an integrated basis in 12 months there are bound to be
problems". Swan is also a vice president of US West, which last year
took a 20 per cent stake in Binariang for an estimated $230m.

A huge potential problem for Binariang is the government's abrupt
policy reversal last June (See APTA June 5). After handing out licences
to all comers, Kuala Lumpur decided there had been too many takers and
that a shake-out should be engineered. Prime Minister Mahathir said:
"If possible, there should be mergers among them so that there are only
3 or 4 companies."

At a heated meeting in September, the licence holders said they had no
intention of doing this. The government had issued the licences and was
legally obliged to honour the commitments it had made.

Binariang, Time Telekom and Mutiara Telecommunications all insist that
they are going ahead with their investments - despite rumblings from
within government about overcapacity and duplication and agreement
within industry that there will undoubtedly be some rationalisation at
a future point. On this, Swan said: "There is going to be a shakeout in
this new industry and Malaysia is going to be no exception. You will
see mergers and partnerships and people becoming niche players."

A long shot is for Time Telekom, part of the politically well connected
Renong group, to buy a controlling share of Telkom Malaysia from the
government.

A fourth likely survivor would be Celcom, the first private cellular
network and by far the biggest with over 75 per cent of cellular
subscribers. For 1996, the big action in the Malaysian telecoms
industry is going to be in mergers and acquisitions.

AUSTRALIA: FOXTEL-AUSTRALIS MERGER FACING RESISTANCE FROM WATCHDOG

The A$700m merger of Foxtel, the cable TV partnership of Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. and national carrier Telstra, and Australis Media,
the microwave and satellite broadcaster, is striking unexpectedly stiff
resistance from Australia's competition watchdog.

This is good news for Optus Vision, the cable TV and telephony arm of
Australia's second carrier Optus Communications, which faced a bleak
future if the merger of Australis and Foxtel was approved
unconditionally. The merger would cut the number of players in
Australia's fledgling pay TV industry from 3 to 2 and combine Telstra's
comfortable lead over Optus Vision in cable rollout with Australis'
monopoly over satellite and microwave distribution (See APTA October
23).

Although there is no widespread expectation that the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission would actually block the merger,
comments by its chairman, Professor Allen Fels, have raised the
possibility that the ACCC will impose strict conditions.

This would force a rejig of the merger, under which Telstra and Optus
would sell Foxtel to Australis for stock giving them a combined 60.5
per cent of its total capital. They would also have 6 directors out of
10.

Professor Fels said in early January the ACCC was worried about the
impact of the merger on the pay-TV and telephony markets, and that
telephony was of more concern because of its vast size. However, he
stressed that no decision had been made. The merger was announced in
October and Australis and Foxtel said they expected the deal to be put
to Australis shareholders in early December.

They executed formal contracts just before Christmas and Australis
advised the Australian Stock Exchange it expected to release documents
in mid-January for the meeting. Both companies have maintained a
steadfast silence since Professor Fels went public with his concerns
about the merger. They had hoped for a decision at the first meeting of
ACCC members for the new year 2 weeks ago, but nothing emerged except
reports the commissioners had endorsed Professor Fels' hard-line stance
on the merger.

Optus Vision has argued the merger would create a "communications
colossus" that would have "devastating and irreversible" effects on
competition and consumers and threaten Optus Vision's plan to crack
Telstra's local calls monopoly with cheaper local calls.

Australis and Foxtel have replied that the merger would make little
difference to competition in the pay-TV market because the 2 companies
already run common programming under an earlier deal sanctioned last
year by the ACCC's predecessor, the Trade Practices Commission. The TPC
appeared to treat pay-TV operators as participants in a broader TV
market that included terrestrial free to air broadcasters in its
reasons for that decision.

Although it emphasised this did not constitute a final determination of
the relevant market for pay-TV operators, the decision was taken as a
sign that the merger would be approved on the grounds that a merger of
fledgling pay-TV operators would have little impact in a market
dominated by established terrestrial broadcasters. But Professor Fels
played this down, saying the merger could be found to be anti-
competitive in telephony - the bigger market - even if it had been
found not to unduly affect competition in pay TV.

After a slow start Australis' subscriber numbers have more than doubled
in the space of a few months to about 70,000, largely as a result of
having adopted Foxtel's giveaway A$20 connection fee and A$40 a month
subscription rates.

Neither Foxtel nor Optus Vision, which did not launch their services
until September/October, have revealed subscriber numbers.

AUSTRALIA: TELSTRA FACES TARIFF RETHINK

Telstra suffered a setback in its plan to restructure tariffs aimed at
service providers late last year (See APTA December 18). Australia's
telecoms regulator, Austel, rejected 2 new service provider tariffs in
the course of approving a package of changes to residential, consumer
and business tariffs. The changes slashed business line rentals, long
distance and ISDN charges and sharply rationalised Telstra's
bewildering range of flexiplan discount plans.

They were designed to help Telstra compete better with Optus and the
aggressive service providers which have taken $3bn in annual revenues
from Telstra. They also aimed to force a rationalisation among service
providers, especially at the bottom end of the market where aggregators
simply combine the bills of their customers and pass back the resulting
volume discounts to them, leaving Telstra to bill and service them
individually.

The flexiplan changes resulted in the withdrawal of 2 local call plans
that proved extremely popular with aggregators, offering volume
discounts of up to 15 per cent, and replaced fees with per account
thresholds for those that remained.

Telstra argued that the heavy use of these tariffs by simple
aggregators was requiring it to pay the discounts without enjoying the
savings of dealing with a single high volume customer.

The tariffs were replaced by 2 new service provider tariffs offering
discounts of up to 37 per cent on long distance and 8 per cent on local
calls for service providers operating full billing help desks and some
service responsibility.

Telstra's strategy of encouraging service providers to take more
responsibility for billing and service is consistent with the views of
Austel, which does not regard aggregators as sustainable competitors or
believe they bring the same benefits as value added and switched
service providers. But the watchdog nevertheless disallowed the new
service provider tariffs on the grounds that they bundled competitive
services with uncompetitive services (local calls) and did not meet the
needs of the service providers' industry.

Since the disallowance, Telstra has continued to talk to service
provider representatives and was expected to meet with Austel over its
new proposals for these tariffs as APTA went to press.

Telstra was saying nothing about the changes it proposed to satisfy
Austel, but the chairman of the Service Providers Action Network
(SPAN), Brian Perkins, said Telstra was still insisting on bundling
local calls with long distance.

"I don't think what they are proposing is likely to satisfy us or
Austel," said Perkins, a senior executive at the switched reseller AAP
Telecommunications. He added that SPAN had no response from Austel to
its request that the regulator order Telstra to leave its popular local
call flexiplans in place while the fate of the new service provider
tariffs is resolved.

Telstra's new tariffs are slated to take effect on February 1 but
Austel has expressed concern about the inadequate time this leaves the
worst affected service providers to restructure their businesses.

Aggregators are being offered the option of upgrading their facilities
and becoming value added service providers, selling out to a value
added service provider, or applying to become authorised Telstra
dealers on more favourable terms.

AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT SAYS "NO" TO UNIVERSAL SERVICES PLAN

A suggestion by national carrier Telstra that services covered by its
universal service obligations be handed over to Australia's telecoms
regulator Austel to put out to tender was quickly stomped on by the
federal government over the Christmas-New Year break.

The suggestion was contained in a submission by Telstra to a government
inquiry into community service obligations under its new competition
regime, which is exposing utilities and the professions to competition
regulation for the first time.

Telstra's submission said the current practice of leaving it with sole
responsibility for providing uneconomical services - such as services
to rural and remote areas and payphones - failed the test of economic
efficiency and was inconsistent with government's plan to bring in more
competition after 1997.

The carrier also said the cross-subsidisation inherent in universal
service reduced incentives for investment by Telstra or other carriers
which might otherwise have entered the market for these services.

Telstra was backed by the Australian Telecommunications Users' Group
(Atug), which agreed that tendering would ensure "the best service is
provided at the best price" and said the way some rural services have
been provided under USO arrangements was "nothing short of appalling".

This was a reference to the digital concentrator radio system (DRCS)
that Telstra uses for remote parts of Australia that can not
economically be reached by landlines.

Telstra chose DRCS over the Aussat satellite service (now owned by the
second carrier Optus Communications) but this is widely believed to
have been a mistake. Atug says DRCS proved "grossly inferior" and the
Aussat satellites "would have been a much superior arrangement."

Optus and AAP Communications - a subsidiary of AAP Information Services
and a corporate half brother to the switched reseller AAP
Telecommunications - both expressed support for the idea and said they
would be interested in looking at any services put up for tender.
However, the Federal communications minister Michael Lee said USO
services would not be put out to tender as the idea had been rejected
when the government fashioned its post-1997 reform package last year.

Opposition communications spokesman Senator Richard Alston supported
Lee and said cross-subsidies from city to rural and remote customers
would remain under his party's plan to privatise Telstra.

Their caution can be explained by the proximity of a tight Federal
election, which must be held by May but is being tipped to be held in
March, and by the electorate's sensitivity to telephone service prices.

Telstra's initiative was reported as an attempt to "privatise"
universal service, but these are already calculated by Austel and paid
for by the 3 carriers in proportion to their revenues. This would
continue if they were put out to tender by Austel.

AAP Communications supplies "full mesh networks" to mining camps using
satellites and Hughes telephony earth stations, including payphone
services that offer employees calls to capital cities at local call
rates.

The group's director of marketing Geoffrey Rolls said it would
"certainly" be interested in providing similar services to Telstra's
rural and remote customers. It could run a network via satellites with
a hub in Sydney or Perth, or alternatively "beam bandwidth into a
remote area then split it off into effectively a local loop," he said.

Mark Harwood, Optus' sales manager for national media, said Optus would
look at any USO services put out to tender but "it would have to be a
business case decision."

HONG KONG: HUTCHISON RESTRUCTURES IN ASIAN EXPANSION DRIVE

Hutchison Whampoa is to revamp its telecoms units as part of a new
expansion drive focusing on the Asia-Pacific region. The company
stressed the move is not preparatory to a separate listing for its
telecoms interests; however, the restructuring would simplify such a
move further down the line.

At the same time, Hutchison bought back a 25 per cent stake in its
paging business from Motorola, the US semiconductor and personal
communications giant. Motorola retains a 30 per cent interest in
Hutchison's Hong Kong cellular telephone business.

Analysts are loathe to rule out the prospect of a future spin-off,
especially now that plans to float Orange, the UK personal
communications network, are coming together.

Under the shake-up, a new umbrella company Hutchison Telecommunications
Hong Kong (HTHK) has been created to consolidate the marketing and
operational resources of Hutchison's mobile telephone, paging and fixed
line network services as well as its trunked radio service in China,
Hong Kong and Macao. The move, in classic Canning Fok style - Fok has
been the group's managing director since 1993 - aims to create
synergies resulting in greater productivity and cost effectiveness.

It is the second big shake-up in Hutchison's 10 year telecoms history.
Hutchison Telecommunications was formed in 1986 to spearhead expansion
in Hong Kong's relatively competitive (that is, cartel-free) paging and
cellular mobile phone sector. However by 1992, having expanded into
overseas markets and nibbled at satellite, Hutchison unveiled a major
retrenchment of its telecoms operations, sacking 40 staff and
surrendering its Asia-Pacific ex-Hong Kong, China and Macao operations
in the process.

This time round there are no casualties, just aggressive expansion
plans. The group will this year invest HK$700m to upgrade its network
services in Hong Kong and expand its mobile infrastructure - the number
of cell sites have already swollen threefold to 300 (from 100) over the
past 5 months.

The company claims to have some 120,000 mobile phone customers and says
about 30,000 customers have subscribed to its recently launched fixed-
line network in Hong Kong. Hutchison plans to double both subscriber
bases this year.

Less bullish is the outlook for the lower market CT2 network, the
sector that proved to be Hutchison's Achilles heel in the UK where it
was ultimately forced to close its Rabbit CT2 operation, writing off
HK$1.4bn in the process. Locally subscribers to Hutchison's CT2 network
have dwindled to below 70,000 from 100,000 last year.

Telecoms businesses in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region will come
under the wing of Hutchison Telecom International, headed up by CN
Khoo. Included here, as well as paging and mobile services, are VSAT
and radio broadcasting.

While Hutchison is one of the colony's leaders in mobile services -
commanding some 18 per cent of the mobile telephone market and 29 per
cent of the pager market - its debut in the fixed network arena at the
end of last year was less pronounced. This is at least partially a
reflection of erstwhile monopoly Hongkong Telecom's stranglehold on the
market and partly to do with Hutchison's own strategy which is broadly
similar to that of fellow new entrants New T&T and New World Telephone
(See APTA June 5).

As well as emphasising discount international calls (still strictly the
exclusive province of Hongkong Telecom, although many loopholes to get
round this exist), all 3 companies are relying on newest technology to
provide a total package for consumers, with a different range of niche
services designed to appeal to business and residential users.

The synergies thrown up by Hutchison's revamp will be seen as the fixed-
network builds on its mobile communications strengths, with wireless
services revolving round the hub of its wireline technology.

The company, again like its 3 new competitors, is bidding for the new
mobile licences which were to have been awarded last year but have been
held up by deliberations in Beijing (See APTA June 19, November 6).

INDIA: BASIC SERVICES AUCTION HEADS FOR THIRD ROUND

Following the poor response to the second round of bidding, the auction
of basic services licences in India is heading for its third round.

The second round which earlier this month drew bids for 5 of the 13
licences on offer, only attracted 6 of the 16 consortia eligible to
bid. Ten groups opted to stay out of the round altogether.

Of the 13 licences on offer, only Punjab attracted more than one bid
(See table over page) and all the offers were far beneath the
astronomical fees quoted by the Himachal Futuristic-led consortium
(HFCL-Bezeq) in the first round (See table and APTA September 11,
December 18).

Licences back on the table for a third time will be: Andaman & Nicobar,
Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, North East, Uttar
Pradesh (East) and West Bengal.

Any further progress will in all probability await a decision from the
Supreme Court on the numerous petitions calling for the privatisation
to be re-examined. The court has ruled that basic services licences
will not be issued until all the petitions - of which there are now 10 -
 have been looked into and disposed of.

Following the second round, Tata Tele Service, Basic Tele Service,
Reliance Industries and Techno Telecom India are set to win the 4
licences of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Bihar respectively
as they are the only groups which bid for these circles. Essar Bell
Atlantic should be operating basic services in Punjab where it is ahead
of its only rival, Bharti Telenet, in its offer.

Shyam Telecom and Hughes-Ispat are set to operate services in Rajasthan
and Karnataka as the licensing authority, the Department of
Telecommunications (DOT), accepted that it had been mistaken in
rejecting their bids in the first round (See APTA December 4). Added to
those already allotted, 12 of the total 21 basic services on offer
nationwide have been allocated.

Analysts say there were several reasons behind the poor turn-out in the
second round including the growing controversy over the HFCL-Bezeq
consortia's winning bids and last month's parliamentary uproar over the
handling of the tender (See APTA December 18). But the strongest
negatives were the high reserve prices set by the Department of
Telecommunications for each licence - the fee had not left to much room
for profits - and the extremely tight tender deadline.

A representative of AT&T Birla said the group had decided not to rebid
for Gujarat where it had made an offer which was rejected as being too
low. "After a thorough evaluation of the business case, the J-V
concluded that at present our figures do not come up to the level of
the reserve price determined for Gujarat," he said.

If it were not for the strong business interests of the companies which
made offers in the second round, even the 5 licences where they placed
bids might have had no takers.

The Reliance industrial group has over $8bn worth of power, refinery,
petrochemical and downstream business coming up in Gujarat. The Tata
industrial group and Bell Canada, partners in Tata Tele Service, and
Usha Telecom, the Indian partner in Techno Telecom India, have already
won cellular licences in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively.

Essar is reportedly buying equity in one of the companies selected for
the Punjab cellular licence.

RPG, the local partner in the Basic Tele Service group, is involved in
cellular in Madras - capital of the state of Tamil Nadu where it placed
the only bid for the basic services licence for that state. It showed
its special interest in this licence by offering a fee of roughly 2 and
a half times that over US West-BPL's offer in the first round - an
offer which was $285m over its initial offer for the licence.

Aside from the Tata Tele Service group which offered more than double
the Rs18bn ($520m) it bid in the first round for Andhra Pradesh, fee
offers for the other circles were only marginally above the DOT's fixed
NVP.

Bidders are still baffled at the formula behind the reserve prices set
by the DOT on each licence, and the Department has still not disclosed
how it came up with the figures. The reserve price for the Gujarat for
instance is much less than that for the relatively less prosperous
states of West Bengal and Kerala.

Meanwhile, Bharti Telecom is the first of many aggrieved bidding groups
to turn to the courts. The J-V has submitted a petition to the high
court which says it should have won the licence for Punjab.

Sunil Mittal, Bharti Telecom chairman, said the situation was
"ridiculous". The company had offered a quote over 2 times the figure
deemed as a reasonable levy by the DOT when it bid in the first round,
but still was not allocated a licence.

Tata Tele Service has also now turned to the courts to resolve its
dispute over the DOT's decision to allocate the Maharashtra licence to
the Hughes-Ispat group. Though Hughes-Ispat offered $674m over the Tata
Tele Service bid, the latter was told it had won overall "on points" -
there are a number of additional criteria which are included in the
evaluation process. However, higher authorities then decided to reject
this decision made by the Tender Evaluation Committee and to award the
licence to the highest bidder - the Hughes-Ispat alliance - instead.

Alongside these 2 new cases, India's Telecoms Industry and Services
Association (TISA), which lobbies on behalf of local telecoms
interests, has turned to the court to block the DOT's decision to
charge the first instalment of the licence fee before the operators
begin service.

INDIA: CRACKS APPEAR IN CELLULAR J-VS

Cracks have appeared in 3 of the J-Vs selected to operate cellular
services in India last month over disputes which are certain to end in
partnership changes.

Differences have emerged between partners in the Koshika Telecom,
Modicom Network and HHS Communications J-Vs over recent weeks.

Pilipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel), foreign player in the Koshika
Telecom J-V, has been pitted against majority partner, Usha India Ltd.
(UIL) in a highly-publicised disagreement over its equity stake (See
story page 9) while Modi Wellvest, majority partner in the Modicom
Network alliance, appears to be in a terminal dispute with its US
foreign partner Vanguard. Singapore Telecom is seeking a way to back
out of Hinduja HCL Singtel (HHS Communications).

Problems at Modicom Network, the Indian-US-Thai alliance which holds
licences for the 2 areas of Punjab and Karnataka, appear to hinge on a
dispute over how much equity capital the foreign partner should tip in.

Vanguard says it agreed to invest $13m of the $50m equity required for
the $100m project (to be funded on a 1:1 debt-equity ratio) for a 26
per cent stake. But the Modis claim that project costs have now risen
to $250m and Vanguard must pump in more funds if it wants to keep a
grip on its 26 per cent stake.

Vince Snowden, Vanguard's representative in India, said the company was
not willing to give more than agreed in the original shareholders
agreement and had no intention of giving its permission for a change of
partnership. "Modicom used our networth and experience as keys to
secure the licences and now after getting them, they want to bring in
new players at our expense," he said.

Last month, Modi Wellvest approached the DOT saying it wanted to
replace Vanguard with Telstra - Modis' partner in cellular services in
Calcutta. But Telstra replied in a statement that not only had it "not
made any commitment to anyone or any consortium to buy in or join the
consortium" but that "Telstra is not contemplating participation in the
Modicom consortium."

Modi then said that Motorola and Lazard Brothers Asia were planning to
join it with 20 per cent and 29 per cent equity respectively, but
Chicago-based Bob Young, vice president, Motorola Network Ventures
Division said Motorola had been approached by a number of cellular
operators to invest in their ventures, "but nothing has been finalised
as yet."

This tangle has remained unresolved despite intervention last week by
Telecom Commission chairman R K Takkar. Modi Wellvest holds 51 per cent
of Modicom Network and the 23 per cent balance is held by Thailand's
Telecom International.

Meanwhile, Singapore Telecom is reportedly seeking to withdraw from the
HHS Communications J-V - licensed to operate in Tamil Nadu - as it is
not keen on participating in a single licence zone. To take on the
licence, the J-V is required to up its original offer by $84m to match
the fee offered by the highest bidder in that state (US West-BPL
Cellular which offered $238m). Ashok Leyland and HCL are the other
Indian partners in the venture.

So far, the DOT appears to be taking a lenient view of the possible
partnerships changes emphasising it wants to see services kick-started
as soon as possible.

Takkar says the DOT will not interfere if the changes fall within
Company Law and Foreign Investment Promotion Board guidelines and new
foreign partners are financially qualified and have necessary service
operation expertise. Government has the right to vet ownership changes
in the first 3 years under the contract agreements, but appears not to
wish to get involved.

The DOT has also been forgiving in allowing consortia to take longer in
paying the first instalment of the licence fees required - the tender
conditions are very specific in saying that if the licence fee is not
paid by the date due, the next highest bidder will be given the chance
to step in. Takkar said however: "The offers won't be cancelled unless
we are convinced that the parties are not serious." He noted that
companies are having to pay a heavy penalty in interest payments on the
amounts they owe and would not bear the burden if they weren't serious.

So far, 28 licences of the 33 selected are set to operate services in
their licence areas having deposited the first instalment of the
licence fee and signed the licences (See APTA December 18). The licence
fees are to be paid in 10 annual instalments.

Koshika Telecom, Modicom Network and HHS Communications have still to
make the first payment (due to their internal disputes) as have Aircel
Digilink and Hexacom India for their Rajhasthan licences. These last 2
groups have sought an extension until month-end following a dispute
with the DOT over whether they should match the highest offer for the
circle quoted by the Modicom group. Modicom was only permitted to take
up 2 cellular licences due to the tender's networth restrictions and
opted to drop the Rajasthan licence after it placed winning bids in 3
circles (See APTA December 18).

The second Karnataka licence has gone to J T Mobile. J T Mobile had
made an identical offer to AT&T Birla for the licence and the DOT broke
the tie by a draw of lots.

JAPAN: NEW MINISTER VOICES 'SERIOUS' RESERVATIONS ON NTT BREAK-UP

The break-up of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) which has
been at the centre of debate in the Japanese telecoms sector over the
past few months has taken a new direction under Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's cabinet.

Hashimoto, who became Japan's leader on January 11 appointed Ichiro
Hino to the "sensitive" position of Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications and within a few days of taking office, Hino stated
that he has serious reservations about the idea of breaking up NTT into
a few companies.

Hino noted that the ultimate decision will be a political one that will
take into consideration the views of all 3 ruling coalition parties -
Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party of
Japan (that of ex-prime minister Tomichii Murayama), and the New Party
Sakigake. Hino has also said that many politicians acknowledge that NTT
is striving to restructure its organisation so as to boost its
efficiency - some have argued this negates the necessity for its
breakup.

Serioku Kajiyama, the new chief cabinet secretary (the official
spokesman for the government) added that it is probable that there will
be no quick decision on the proposal to divide up NTT. Such a decision
would be likely to be made in the next fiscal year, according to
Kajiyama. The principal concerns were how Japan can remain competitive
with other advanced nations in the telecoms arena and how a possible
break-up of NTT would affect the country's international
competitiveness, Kajiyama said. He implied that to divide up NTT would
mean scattering the resources of Japan's sole telecoms company capable
of competing in the global arena.

Japanese newspapers have widely reported that Prime Minister, Hashimoto
opposes the idea of an NTT breakup. Furthermore, with elections coming
up in the not-too-distant future, major politicians like Hashimoto seek
to avoid alienating NTT's labour unions - which will mobilise tens of
thousands of votes.

The Telecommunications Council, an independent advisory body, is slated
to submit a report to the government in late February that is likely to
advocate a division of NTT so as to spur domestic competition. However,
the new Hashimoto cabinet appears to be more concerned about Japan's
status vis-a-vis international telecoms competition and especially in
nurturing Japan's technical capabilities in the sector.

Hashimoto's position largely opposes the idea of dividing NTT on the
basis that it would damage NTT's research efforts as well as its
potential to "compete" with international heavyweights such as AT&T,
MCI and British Telecom.

NTT - Japan's "flag carrier" - is currently limited to the domestic
market, but the new government's rationale could indicate that it may
be allowed to compete internationally sooner than might have been
expected.

PHILIPPINES: PILTEL THREATENS TO WITHDRAW FROM INDIAN J-V

Philipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel) has threatened to withdraw from a J-
V with Usha India Ltd. after disagreements over how the partnership
would be divided.

The Philippines' leading mobile-phone provider and Usha have resumed
negotiations to head off a collapse of Koshika Telecom Ltd., which won
licences to operate cellular telephone service in 3 areas of India.

Both sides have expressed confidence that deal can be worked out that
will allow Piltel a larger stake. In the meantime, a New Delhi court
has issued a restraining order blocking Piltel's withdrawal.

Piltel notified Usha that it intended to drop out of the partnership
after the Indian company refused a request for a larger stake. Under
preliminary agreement, Piltel was granted a 10 per cent equity interest
in Koshika with an option to increase to 34 per cent.

Usha has balked at allowing the increase, saying Piltel failed to
exercise its options before the bidding for the cellular licence was
issued late last year. Usha holds 85 per cent of shares in Koshika with
the balance of 5 per cent in the hands of a US-resident individual,
Chirinjeev Kathuria. "We are still in the process of negotiations,"
said Joseph Santiago, head of Piltel's legal department. "We just want
them to stick to the original agreement."

Santiago sent a team of negotiators to Manila to try to hammer out the
ownership disagreements with out success. Another round of talks was
scheduled in January. The court has instructed Piltel not to withdraw
or dilute its shareholding below 10 per cent until the case is disposed
of. The next court hearing is fixed for March 27.

Analysts said Piltel's threat to quit Koshika was nothing more than a
negotiation ploy to force Usha to increase the Philippine company's
equity stake. Without Piltel, the J-V could be in jeopardy along with
the cellular phone licences.

"Piltel wants to increase their participation to the point where they
are the managing partner," said Wilfred Son Keng Po, vice president at
Worldsec International Ltd. in Manila. "Usha wants a silent partner."

Vineet Rai, senior vice-president of Usha said Piltel had realised the
real worth of the project after the licences had been issued. "We will
not succumb to arm-twisting by our foreign partner," he said, "and by
obtaining an injunction we are further securing our position."

Ajay Chaudhury, Koshika Telecom chief executive added that the first
stage of the project would be completed by April 2 "with or without
Piltel". Piltel refused to send its technical staff for the project
unless it was allowed the additional equity, but Koshika brought in
Telecom Finland subsidiary, Telecon, to assist.

When the partnership with Usha was announced, Piltel officials said it
was a step toward taking the cellular company regional by providing
expertise in designing cellular networks in developing countries.

Piltel is the largest cellular phone operator in the Philippines with a
subscriber base that is forecast to reach 195,000 subscribers by year-
end. The country's population is about 65m.

Koshika's 3 service areas cover 260m people in Orissa, Uttar Pradesh
West and Uttar Pradesh East. That is a potentially lucrative source of
additional revenue, particularly when Piltel faces growing competition
at home.

Santiago said the experience in India hadn't soured Piltel on becoming
a partner in other companies in the region. "We are still trying to
look into being partners in other countries in the region," Santiago
said. "We have to learn from our experience in India."

Ramon Cojuangco, Piltel chairman, said 2 countries near India had
approached the company about cellular contracts.

PHILIPPINES: PLDT MAKES FIRST STAFF CUTS

For the first time in the company's long history, Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Corp. (PLDT) is eliminating jobs to increase
efficiency and trim excessive costs.

PLDT said it will eliminate 661 jobs - or 2.3 per cent of the total
workforce - thorough lay-offs or early retirements. The cuts are the
first phase of a retrenchment programme that could reduce PLDT's
workforce by 10 per cent.

"This is a significant change in the company's culture," said Ricardo
Tan, assistant vice president for investor relations. "We've never done
this in the 7 decades of our existence."

The departing employees include 35 executives, 243 managers and 383
workers. The company did not say how much it will spend for early
retirement or how much the long-term payroll savings will be.

PLDT is among the region's most inefficient telcos with about 48 lines
per employee, compared with 196 for Hongkong Telecom and 97 for Telekom
Malaysia, according to CS First Boston. Total salaries and wages in
1994 were Ps4.03bn ($153.8m), or nearly 29 per cent of the company's
overall expenses.

The lay-offs come as the 67 year old company undergoes an unprecedented
expansion to try to meet growing demand for communications. Between
1993 and 2001, PLDT plans to add almost 3m lines to its current network
of about 1.5m. It also plans to make its network all-digital to offer
new network services such as call-waiting and conference calls.

PLDT officials said many of those leaving are personnel familiar with
old equipment that the company is phasing out. "Some, rather than go
through retraining, would rather retire and take the golden handshake,"
Tan said.

"The programme will immediately cause some huge cash outlay, but the
medium- and long-term cost savings are enough to offset any initial
expense," said Conrad Andres, research director at DVP-Daiwa Securities
Philippines Inc.

PLDT, a former monopoly, now faces at least 8 companies in the
lucrative market for international calls. Some 60 per cent of its
revenue comes from overseas calls. Since December 1, it has had a
policy of not hiring new personnel.

SRI LANKA: SRI LANKA PRESSES AHEAD WITH TELECOMS PRIVATISATION

Sri Lanka has announced plans to press ahead with the privatisation of
the state-owned telephone company, Sri Lanka Telecom, within 6 months
despite widespread protests from trade unions.

Telecoms Minister Mangala Samaraweera said Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) was
unable to meet the explosive demand for phones in the country and
desperately needed fresh capital to expand its services. "Privatisation
of Sri Lanka Telecom is non-negotiable," the minister said adding that
trade unions were resisting because they were not fully aware of the
process.

Earlier this month, the government awarded the restructuring of SLT to
a consortium comprising investment bankers Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon, accounting firm Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu International and law firm Slaughter and May.

The minister said SLT together with 2 private operators with a licence
to provide wireless loop connections will be able to hook up only
400,000 new telephones by 1997 although the demand would be well over
1m. He said SLT was committed to an investment of some Rs20bn ($377m)
in the next 18 months but would find it difficult to raise the capital
unless it was privatised soon.

"We need huge resources to develop telecommunications," Samaraweera
said. "We must understand the realities of the 21st century. We have to
move forward with the new technology and for that we can't get money on
our own."

Privately, however, analysts say the government is desperate to raise
money through the sale of its assets to meet a huge budget deficit
brought about by its ballooning defence expenditure. The ruling
People's Alliance had opposed privatisation when it was in opposition,
but was forced to resort to do it to bridge the budget deficit of
Rs87.5bn (1.65bn dollars) in 1996.

The government hopes to raise Rs21bn ($396.22m) from the sale of state
enterprises during 1996. The Sri Lanka Telecom sale along with the
national airline AirLanka are expected to raise most of that revenue.
Both will be up for grabs by the middle of the year. Sri Lanka Telecom
had a turnover of Rs5,000m (94.33m dollars) in the year ending
September 1995.

Telecommunication trade unions say that retrenchment will be inevitable
as private management's take over SLT, which currently employs some
7,500 workers. The number of direct exchange lines operated by SLT is
200,000.

The World Bank has been asking Sri Lanka Telecom to reduce its staff
but officials said they were only prepared to reduce the worker/phone
ratio by increasing the number of phones. However, there was no money
for that.

The trade unions argue that tariffs will rise sharply following
privatisation. The SLT currently charges Rs13,000 ($245) for a new
phone connection although the actual cost is estimated at Rs106,000
($2,000).

"Privatisation is a curse," said J. B. P. Dissanayake, the president of
the Joint Organisation of Telecommunication Unions (JOTTU). "We all
must oppose it," he added.

SRI LANKA: GREEN LIGHT FOR FOREIGN WIRELESS LOOP VENTURES

Sri Lanka has given the green light to 2 foreign consortiums to set up
private telephone networks across the country using wireless loop
technology.

Secretary to the ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, K. C.
Logeswaran said the cabinet had accepted proposals by Bell Canada and
Telia of Sweden to set up networks with 100,000 lines each within 3
years. "They will have 3 weeks to incorporate companies locally to
undertake the work," Logeswaran said. "Thereafter, they will be issued
licences to (formally) operate parallel networks in competition with
(state-owned) Sri Lanka Telecom."

The 2 consortiums will have to pay a once-and-for-all fee of Rs300m
($5.66m) each for the licence but they will be free to determine their
tariffs.

"We got the initial proposals on June 30 and within 41 days we were
able to go through the technical evaluation process and obtain cabinet
approval for the 2 private networks," Logeswaran said.

Logeswaran said each of the 2 private operators - who will compete
against each other as well - was expected to provide at least 40,000
phone connections in the first year of operation and go up to 100,000
lines within 3 years.

There are some 220,000 potential telephone subscribers in the queue,
some which have been waiting for nearly 10 years for a phone connection
from Sri Lanka Telecom. However, the government estimates that the
actual demand is about 1m.

The two private operators will provide "wireless loop" phone
connections - eliminating the need for costly land lines - connecting
into Sri Lanka Telecom's backbone network to access international
circuits and other phone users in the country.

Long delays in obtaining fixed line phones in Sri Lanka have boosted
the sales of cellular phone operators in the past 6 years. The number
of mobile subscribers is estimated at 55,000.

TAIWAN: CONTROVERSIAL BILLS SHOULD BE PASSED BY MONTH-END

The long anticipated reading of Taiwan's 3 Telecom bills - which could
allow up to one third foreign ownership in telecoms J-Vs and offer up a
raft of new mobile licences - passed 2 readings in the Legislative Yuan
(LY) earlier this month despite persistent protest by telecoms
employees.

Industry observers said the bills are expected to become law by the end
of the month when the terms and conditions for potential operators will
be announced and a review committee formed to examine potential
bidders. The fact that the controversial bills had passed the first 2
readings showed a government commitment to bulldozing the proposals
through the legislature - despite outcries by the national operator's
employees, they said. Delays which have extended month after month
would soon be over; bills that pass the third and final reading become
law.

At a press conference, Liu Chao-shiuan, Minister of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC), last month avowed that privatisation "will
happen" and was "inevitable". Since then, the government has repeatedly
stressed that the privatisation of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications (DGT) forms the backbone of its Asia Pacific
Regional Operations Centre (APROC) plan - the high-profile scheme which
calls for Taiwan to become a regional hub for multinational
corporations and international telecoms traffic.

Meanwhile, however, several thousand DGT employees have continued to
protest outside the LY during the many review sessions being held by
its Telecommunication Committee since late December. They are
protesting that privatisation and liberalisation will see the new China
Telecommunication Co. - a spin-off of DGT proposed under one of the
bills - become an uncompetitive state-owned operator which will be
forced to rationalise, resulting in huge lay-offs.

Union members also threatened to shut off telephone switching systems
that operate public telephones and to destroy telecoms equipment, but
the DGT has countered that any employee found attempting to do so,
would be dismissed. High ranking MOTC officials have asked union
members to take a hard look at "the problems" facing Taiwan's telecoms
industry."

One of "the problems" they feel is the inability of existing
infrastructure to service the needs of large corporations that rely
heavily on the network - the kind of corporations that the APROC policy
is seeking to attract.

Acer Sertek Inc. - Taiwan's largest computer manufacturing company -
dragged this issue centre stage earlier this month when it threatened
to move its international telecoms centre to Hong Kong or Hawaii. Acer
plans to call in a telecoms company, such as AT&T or MCI, to help set
up an international network for them.

The announcement shook several government agencies, prompting the high
ranking Council for Economic and Development to say the group's plans
to move should be taken "as a warning to the country."

Top officials have been quoted in local papers as saying that unless
the 3 bills are passed by the legislature, the lack of a strong
telecoms infrastructure will be detrimental to the island's ambitions
as a regional operations centre.

The pro-liberalisation lobby would appear unstoppable. Minister Liu
said that he and other ministry officials would mobilise legislators to
pass the bills including amendments that call for the lucrative paging
and cellular sectors to be cracked open (See story below).

Several computer associations have also been collecting signatures to
show their support for the passing of the bills.

TAIWAN: TAIWAN PLANS TO OFFER 8 NEW GSM AND PCS LICENCES

Taiwan looks set to offer a total 8 new cellular licences to would-be
operators following a public meeting held last month which looked into
plans to liberalise the sector.

Following the meeting, chaired by Mao Chi-kuo, Vice Minister of the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) it was decided that at
least 3 regional GSM licences (covering north, central and south
Taiwan) and 3 regional PCS licences as well as 2 island-wide PCS
licences should be offered to new operators. Revised proposals are
awaiting approval by the Legislative Yuan (See story above).

Other parties at last month's meeting included representatives from
APROC Window (the group that advised the MOTC to liberalise), high
ranking officials from the national operator, the Directorate General
of Telecommunications (DGT) and private companies vying for licences.

The number of new licences on the table has come as a surprise to many
observers.

Taipei-based David Hoffman, Technology Practice Director at Coopers and
Lybrand, told APTA that while competition would be healthy for Taiwan,
he believed the introduction of so many licences at one time would make
it difficult for consumers to differentiate between the products and
services on offer and for operators to get a head start. He added that
the nature of the licences may not be "entirely fair" to operators: "It
depends on who wins the licences, whether they are also able to work
together," he said. "Taiwan does not have a strong regulator to oversee
that interconnections are easily made.

If the DGT is involved in the process, it would be in their own
interest to make it as difficult as possible for their competition to
enter the market."

The bills propose an auction method for awarding licences, but this is
coming under fire from local lobby groups. Hoffman agreed: "Auctions
for multiple licenses don't work all that well."

An auction would only encourage collusion and higher pricing because
those who make astronomical bids would be unable to charge more than
the going rates, he said, and recommended a bid-type method of awarding
licenses linked to performance, as was adopted in Hong Kong.

In Hong Kong, operators put down a performance bond, proposed tariff
rates and their plan for network deployment cover range and stated when
they would be up and running. The bidder guarantees to pay a penalty if
it fails to do what it outlined in its proposals. That way, operators
propose their best service, fastest roll out time and are obliged to
come up with their proposed goods on time.

Edmond Tsai, Motorola general manager, told APTA he believed cellular
penetration in Taiwan could reach well over 3m users by 2000 - up to 15
to 20 percent of the 21m population by then.

TROUBLES AT DAYA MITRA - INDONESIAN KSO UNIT - COULD CAUSE DIFFICULTIES

Domestic telecoms provider PT Telkom has launched its remarkable Joint
Operating Scheme (JOS), handing over the running of most of Indonesia's
telecoms infrastructure to private-sector consortia. But with Telkom
Malaysia apparently reconsidering its participation in the scheme,
there is uncertainty about the future of the PT Daya Mitra Malindo
consortium, due to take over the telephone network in Kalimantan this
month.

Telkom president Setyanto Santosa said on 13 January, without giving
details, that there were still difficulties within Daya Mitra.

Daya Mitra has been plagued by unidentified "internal problems" since
shortly after the JOS contracts were signed in October (See APTA
September 25, December 18). The difficulties were earlier thought to
involve a tug-of-war between leading local partner PT Alatief Nusakarya
Corp. and the major foreign partner in the venture, Telkom Malaysia,
regarding control of the project.

In early January Telekom Malaysia, which has a 25 per cent stake in the
consortium, raised the possibility of a withdrawal from the project.
Given that each of the JOS consortia was required to make up-front
payments of tens of millions of dollars any firm replacing the
Malaysian company would presumably "buy it out".

Kalimantan is now the only JOS division that has yet to be handed over
to its selected consortium. Encompassing most of the large island of
Borneo, the territory is the smallest project in the scheme in terms of
both the number of existing lines and the lines to be installed (See
table over page).

Daya Mitra's other members are PT Intidaya Sistelindomitra; Koptuindo
Telecom Malaysia Bhd; TM Communications (UK) Ltd; and American
International Assurance Co. Ltd. Under its contract with Telkom, the
consortium is to lay 237,000 new lines over the next 3 years (See table
previous page).

According to M Furqon I Hanief, executive director of the Indonesian
Telecommunications Society (Mastel), the problems in Daya Mitra is not
one between Telekom Malaysia and Alatief Corp. but is rather,
"something inside Telekom Malaysia".

"If it was a dispute between the partners, Alatief could easily find
another foreign partner," Hanief told APTA. "There are plenty of
Japanese companies which would very much like to participate," he
added.

Alternatively, Hantief speculated, Telkom Malaysia's extended posturing
might be designed to exact changes to Daya Mitra's JOS contract. But he
said he did not know what the desired changes to Daya Mitra's contract
might be. "I have been asking various people about this, but so far I
haven't got any answers," he conceded.

While Daya Mitra is alone among the 5 JOS consortia in holding up its
ascension to the driving seat, Jakarta observers are taking a
sympathetic view of the group's difficulties, obscure as they are.

"It is probably genuine that they are balking at the terms," said
Jakarta-based Robert Adair of GK Goh's Securities. Representatives of
Daya Mitra declined to comment on the problem.

Indonesia's Telkom, which floated 19 per cent of its enlarged share
capital on the New York, London, Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges
in November, has reportedly advised the Jakarta Stock Exchange that
Telkom Malaysia may have to be replaced with another foreign partner.

During their 15-year concession periods, the 5 JOS consortia are
expected to operate and maintain their existing fixed lines in their
respective geographical divisions, as well as laying a total of more
than 2m new lines before the end of March 1999. This expansion is to be
the private sector's contribution to the 5m lines which the government
aims to see laid by the end of its 6th 5-year development plan (April
1994-March 1999).

Telkom is to receive a minimum annual payment from each of the
consortia - in the region of $100m and 30 per cent of their operating
revenues. The existing networks are assumed by the JOS contracts to be
self-financing, while the costs of the new lines are to be borne by the
consortia. As Telkom's Santoso was quoted recently: "Telkom has nothing
to lose."

Greater Jakarta and East Java, Indonesia's 2 largest manufacturing and
commercial centres, will remain in Telkom's hands.

The JOS contracts are said to provide that Telkom may grant further
network-expansion projects to the companies, while the JOS consortia
are to have what is described as "First negotiating rights". Jakarta
based Laksono Widodo of Barings in Jakarta speculated that the Daya
Mitra difficulties involve the number of new lines stipulated in the
contract.

"Probably Telkom Malaysia plans to install more than the number of
lines stated in the contract," he told APTA. "So the local partner
would have to contribute more in terms of investment." Widodo added
that the dispute appears to be between the parties to the consortium -
an increase in the number of lines would presumably entail an amendment
to the contract between Daya Mitra and Indonesia's Telkom.

Any amendment to any of the JOS contracts is bound to be resisted
strenuously by Telkom, not least because of the precedent it would set
for the other 4 consortia. Telkom Malaysia may not be the only
participation company nervous about the profitability of the JOS
scheme, under which the private sector bears virtually all the risks.

"It's quite dangerous ground for Telkom. Others might start asking to
have their contracts amended," said an analyst with an international
firm in Jakarta. "The government wants to avoid any substantial
renegotiation of the KSO (JOS) agreements particularly in view of
future privatisations," the source told APTA.

In the JOS division of Eastern Indonesia, which is comprised of
Sulawesi, Irian Jaya, Maluku and East and West Nusa Tengara, PT Bukaka
Singtel took over the telecoms network on 3 January. Comprised of
Singapore Telecom International and Fadel Muhammad's Bukaka Telekomindo
International, the consortium is to lay 403,000 new lines.

Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, a consortium of PT Astratel Nusantara (59 per
cent); PT Intertel Pratama Media; the cooperative of telecoms ministry
employees; France Cable et Radio (a France Telecom subsidiary), took
over the existing 600,000 lines in Sumatra on 8 January. Astratel is a
subsidiary of Indonesia's publicly-listed Astra International Pramindo
is expected to install 460,000 new lines on the island at an estimated
cost of $570m. Santosa was quoted as saying that his company's minimum
revenue payment from Pramindo would be Rp514bn for this year, a figure
to be paid on top of 30 per cent of operating profits.

Reuters reported in mid-January that Pramindo has mandated Banque
Nationale de Paris, Chase Manhattan Bank Asia, Fuji Bank and Societe
General to arrange a $350m commercial loan facility to finance the
Sumatra project. The credit facility, which is to be offered for
general syndication shortly, will mature in 8 years.

In the JOS division of West Java, the PT Aria West International
consortium took charge of domestic telecoms on 12 January. Aria West is
made up of PT Aritmas Kencana Murni, PT Aria Bahtera Internusa, US West
International and the Asian Infrastructure Fund. Its contract provided
for the installation of 500,000 new lines, more than doubling the size
of the phone network to 985,896 lines by the end of March, 1999. This
will see Sumatra's telephone penetration reach 3.8 as compared with 1.8
at present. Penetration (the ratio of lines per 100 population) stands
at 1.6 lines nationally.

PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia, made up of PT Indosat, Widya
Duta Informindo, Kokarindo, PT Krida Salindo Sentosa, Telstra
(Australia), Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, Itochu, and Sumitomo
took over the JOS division of Central Java and Yogyakarta on 9 January.
The consortium must lay 400,000 new lines. Mitra Global's minimum
annual payment to Telkom will be Rp300m ($130.4m). According to
Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board, the Mitra Global project
represents an investment of $640m.

TELECOM NEW ZEALAND PLANS TO ENTER CABLE TV MARKET

Telecom New Zealand's planned investment in Sky TV New Zealand may be
under threat, but this will not affect its plans to enter the cable TV
market.

Telecom said late last month that the Sky acquisition has been
"parked". It was reacting to a court order obtained by Clear
Communications which prevents it going ahead with a programming centre
agreement with Sky.

Clear is seeking to have the programming content agreement stopped on
the grounds it is anti-competitive (See APTA October 9).

This court offer follows an earlier one relating to Telecom's purchase
of 24.9 per cent of Sky from its major shareholders Bell Atlantic and
Ameritech. This is in limbo until the courts rule definitively on the
bid by Clear and BellSouth New Zealand to have overturned the go-ahead
for the deal from the New Zealand Commerce Commission.

Telecom has already hinted it might eventually not go ahead with that
part of the deal if the value of the investment, and therefore the
price it has to pay, goes up too much in the intervening period.

As the agreement to acquire a financial stake in Sky was also
conditional to reaching a content agreement, the deal is now in
jeopardy on 2 fronts.

On the other, Telecom says, "Clear's spoiling tactics just reinforce
our determination to get on with the business of providing a new
service and offering more choice to more and more people."

GSM NETWORK IN SHANGHAI

China Unicom, fledgeling second network operator, has attracted 10,000
subscribers to its GSM network in Shanghai since it began signing them
up 3 months ago. Its competitor, the dominant Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT), has a total 160,000 subscribers on 2 analogue
and one digital network in the city.

Unicom, which also has mobile services in Beijing, Tianjin and
Guangzhou, plans to extend its GSM networks to 20 more cities by March.
It also aims to launch its preliminary fixed telephone network in
Shanghai in the first quarter of this year.

Peng Pingxuan, general manager of Unicom's Beijing branch, said he was
confident of the company's prospects over the coming year and believed
Unicom's entry to the market meant good news for the sector.

"Since Unicom was established", he said, "the price of mobile phones in
the Beijing market has fallen by 10,000 Yuan." The MPT was trying to
match its services in the digital phone market, he said, and was
spending heavily on advertising to promote its services for the first
time.

Unicom plans to lay a fibre-optic cable network in Beijing and to add
an additional 40 to 50 base stations to its cellular network there.
This would take its capacity to 100,000 connections in Beijing, Peng
said, including 30,000 lines for long distance calls.

TELEKOM MALAYSIA SIGNING EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS

Telekom Malaysia has followed the example of rival Binariang and
started signing exclusive agreements to provide telecoms services.

Binariang, which last week lofted Malaysia's first telecoms satellite
(See cover story), was the first in the field signing with tenants and
co-investors in the massive Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) project in
the heart of capital. KLCC, the brainchild of Ananda Krishnan (the
controlling shareholder in Binariang), has twin office towers as its
centrepiece that when finished next year will be the world's tallest.

Mohammed Said, Telekom chief executive, said: "We have 20 deals on the
cards, mostly in peninsular Malaysia as well as one in Sarawak".

Typical of the 4 deals is the one signed in January with the property
developer Kemayan Corp., that envisaged an investment of M$1m (US$4.4m)
for designing and installing a fibre-optic based telecoms system in
Rasah Kemanyan, a new township an hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur.

Telekom, as normal, receives its payment in revenue deduction but
benefits because Rasah Kemayan residents will have their lines pre-
installed, thus freezing out the competition. Kemayan gains because
Telekom undertakes installation of the systems and maintains them under
a service contract.

Rickie Tang, chief executive of the listed Kemayan said: "The network
installed in the township will include such advanced facilities as
voice mail, mobile telephones, video conferencing and distance
learning".

PAKISTAN'S NATIONAL OPERATOR OPEN TO BIDDING

Pakistan's national operator will be open to bidding from strategic
investors at the end of the month, when the names of interested parties
will also be revealed.

PTC is now officially an autonomous public limited company following
the passing of a government ordinance late last year.

From January 1, the old PTC was segmented with core operations becoming
the new Pakistan Telecom Co. Ltd. (PTCL) and its previous regulatory
functions stripped out into 2 new bodies: the Frequency Allocation
Board (FAB) responsible for frequency planning and allocation, and the
Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) becoming the new regulator and
administrative body.

The National Telecom Corp. (NTC) also bourne from the old PTC will look
after government and military telephones.

The entire privatisation process is expected to be completed by March
when PTCL will see a change in management. The present chairman of PTC,
Mian Javed, will however, be the chief executive of PTCL.

The terms and conditions of the employees will remain the same and any
further changes will be made in consultation with the regulator (PTA).

BUKAKA SINGTEL SHORTLISTS 3 SUPPLIERS

Bukaka Singtel has already shortlisted 3 suppliers for its J-V with
Telkom which calls for a minimum of 403,000 new telephone lines to be
installed under a 15-year concession.

The J-V is anticipated to commence work on the installation process in
April and expects to begin telephone services by the end of 1999.

Bukaka Singtel, 40-per-cent-owned by Singapore Telecom International
and 60-per-cent by PT Bukaka Telekomindo International, is one of 5
groups licensed to install and operate lines all over Indonesia under
revenue-sharing arrangements with the national operator, PT Telkom (See
story page 12).

It expects the project to incur a maximum US$400m capital expenditure
including the installation of lines in its concession area which covers
the main islands of Bali, Lombok, Timor, Maluku, Irian Jaya and
Sulawesi.

KOREA'S FIRST DIGITAL CELLULAR SERVICE

Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) got Korea's first digital cellular service
off the ground early this month with the launch of its long-awaited
CDMA network in Seoul.

Service is currently available in Incheon and Pucheon - 2 areas in the
west of the capital - and will gradually become available across other
areas as base stations are rolled out.

Analysts are not expecting explosive digital cellular growth until the
price of handsets comes down. The CDMA handsets offered by KMT are
retailing at a little under $1000. Shinsegi Corp., KMT's sole
competitor, has put off its launch until June.

KMT's CDMA network is the second of its kind to be launched worldwide.
Hutchison Telecom launched the world's first in Hong Kong last
September.

NTT APPLIES TO REDUCE CHARGES ON PERSONAL HANDYPHONE SYSTEM

NTT Central Personal Communications Inc. and its 8 regional group
companies have applied to reduce charges on their personal handyphone
system (PHS) starting February 1.

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) group PHS companies want
to cut their basic weekday short-distance rates to be more competitive
with the PHS firms in the DDI Inc. group (led by DDI Tokyo Pocket
Telephone Inc.) and the Astel group (led by Astel Tokyo Corp.).

The NTT PHS companies also want to reduce their new subscription charge
from 4,200 yen to 3,000 yen.

There were a total 620,000 PHS subscribers in Japan at the end of 1995.
Uptake of the service, which was launched in mid-1995, is developing
much slower than originally forecasts. The DDI group had just over
250,000 PHS subscribers at the end of 1995, and its projection for this
calendar year had been cut.

SRI LANKA TELECOMS PROJECT

Sri Lanka has awarded a $7m contract to a French and Japanese
partnership to provide consultancy services for a Japanese-funded
telecoms project in the mountainous central region of the country.

State-run Sri Lanka Telecom last week signed the agreement with Japan's
Nippon Telecommunications Corp. (NTT) and Sofrecom of France to provide
designs and supervise the work of the proposed project estimated to
cost $94m.

The entire project to establish 37,900 new direct exchange lines and
32,000 trunk is financed through a soft loan from Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and is expected to be completed within
3 and a half years.

JAPANESE CELLULAR SUBSCRIBERS

Japanese cellular subscribers more than doubled in 1995, reaching
8.05m, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun. Subscriptions in calendar
1995 reached 4.68.

Market leader NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc, (NTT DoCoMo) - a
subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. - had a total of
3.93m customers at the end of the year, but its market share fell to
48.8 per cent from 54.4 per cent at the end of 1994. This was the first
time that NTT DoCoMo's share has fallen below 50 per cent.

Second-ranking DDI Corp., had 1.62m customers, followed by 3 other
cellular phone operators.

Subscriptions are continuing to rise at a brisk pace, with December
setting a record of 572,700 new digital and analogue cellular
customers.

The 1995 introduction of the micro-cellular personal handyphone system
(PHS) business, featuring less expensive calls, had not hurt the
standard cellular business, which is expected to grow by at least 1m
new customers every 2 months in 1996, the paper said.

NTT WANTS TO REDUCE LONG-DISTANCE CALL CHARGES

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) wants to reduce its long-distance
call charges from next month but is awaiting a green light from the
regulator, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

If the Ministry gives the go-ahead, other common carriers like DDI
Corp., Teleway Japan Corp., and Japan Telecom Co., are expected to
follow suit.

NTT charges Y180 for a 3 minute daytime call made during a weekday for
distances over 160km. It hopes to cut the rate to between Y140 to Y150
for the base 3 minute long-distance call. A formal decision on the
exact level of the cut are expected by the end of the month (January).

NTT's 3 main competitors charge Y170 for their base 3 minute long-
distance calls and are expected to reduce their rates to approximately
Y10 yen under the new NTT long-distance rates. The pricing must be
slightly lower than that of NTT for them to remain competitive.

NTT last reduced its base 3 minute long-distance charge by Y20 in
October 1993, from a previous rate of Y200 for a 3 minute call.

SPEECHTEK DEVLOPERS CONFERENCE DRAWS MORE THAN 700 ATTENDEES

Speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis, two emerging
technologies now-bringing "killer applications" to market as
they change the way humans and machines interact, were the
focal points of the SpeechTEK 95 Developers Conference held in
Boston recently.

The goal of most speech technology is to create completely
natural interfaces between people and the machines they use,
replacing cumbersome keyboards, awkward telephone keypads and
making a wide range of consumer products easier to use. One
example, Wildfire, screens, routes and announces incoming
calls for mobile professionals. Other applications include
voice dialing for cellular car phones, allowing drivers to
keep both hands on the wheel.

Attendees at SpeechTEK 95 had a chance to explore the world
of advanced speech technology by viewing live demonstrations
of existing products; hearing presentations from senior
executives of leading speech recognition companies and
attending issue-orientated workshops.

Peter J. Foster, president and CEO of Voice Control Systems,
informed the crowd that after a decade that featured market
research projections of a billion dollar market, speech
technology has now begun to develop "killer applications."
Alan G. O'Dacre, assistant vice president for business line
management and engineering at Nortel showed how the public
telephone network has been transformed by the use of voice
technologies and how they will become dramatically easier ill
the near future. Walt Tetschner, president of Tern Systems and
a renown industry consultant, predicted that the various
market segments of speech technology would enjoy strong growth
in the near future, with most seeing 20% and 30% growth rates
through 1998. John Oberteuffer, publisher of ASR News, an
industry newsletter, moderated a panel which updated attendees
on efforts to develop API (Application Programming Interface)
standards.

Another sign of industry growth was the recent launch of
Speech Technology magazine, the first publication devoted
entirely to applied speech technology. This year's conference,
SpeechTEK '96, is scheduled for Sept. 30 through Oct. 2 in
New York.

Comtek International, Inc. which produced and managed
SpeechTEK, is a company that produces about 20 trade shows a
year, many in the former Soviet Union.  Founded in 1990, the
firm employs about 50 people at its headquarters, 43 Danbury
Rd., Wilton, CT 06897.

SPEECH TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE PUBLISHES FIRST EDITION

Speech Technology magazine, the first publication devoted
solely to the rapidly emerging technologies that are changing
how machines and humans interact, published its first edition
recently.

The magazine examines how speech recognition software, once
thought to be only the stuff of science fiction movies, is
available here and now, and for uses far beyond the computer.
"Very soon, we will be talking to our cars and television
sets, and they will be talking back," said Brian Lewis, editor
of the quarterly publication. readers are the users and
evaluators of this technology -- the next wave of innovators
who are putting this exciting technology to practical use.
They are the people defining an industry that will shape the
way the world works and plays," he added. The magazine was
first available at SpeechTEK '95, a conference for speech
technology developers held in Boston.

The premier edition featured articles on a variety of speech
recognition issues. The articles included how speech should
become the natural interface for public telephone network
services, the advent of "no hands" dialing for cellular car
phones and the speech recognition problems caused by different
dialects. The magazine also featured detailed market forecasts
for the various segments of the automatic speech recognition
and text-to-speech markets and a review of the factors
involved in the development of API (application program
interface) standards.

Filling an Industry Void

Despite the fact that voice recognition and speech synthesis
have become hot industry topics for many business and
technical publications, users have long had to glean
information from publications that had only a casual interest
in the topic. "Speech Technology fills a long standing void in
the industry," said Lewis. "We were surprised to find that no
other national publication focused on speech. The timing, the
technology and the market conditions all seemed right to
launch the magazine at this time."

CI Publishing is a division of Comtek International, Inc.,
which produced and managed SpeechTEK.

1995 YEAR-END BROADBAND NETWORKING REVIEW

     Upon reviewing the developments in the 1995 broadband networking
market, the differences in terms of market acceptance and technical
development of each broadband technology -- frame relay, switched
multimegabit data service (SMDS), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
-- are dramatic.  Each networking solution occupies a different
position on the acceptance curve, and carriers and vendors pursued
numerous strategies in 1995 to spur the adoption of the technologies.
     It is not news to BROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS' readers that frame
relay had an incredibly successful 1995.  Carriers increased the
robustness of their networks to meet clamoring demand, pursued a
variety of pricing strategies designed to capture greater market
shares, and offered enhanced frame relay services to satisfy more
sophisticated users.  All three measures reflect the technology's
maturity and mass market acceptance as a wide area networking
solution.

  ...Frame Relay Pricing Approaches

     AT&T, Sprint Corp., and MCI Communications Corp. all unveiled new
frame relay pricing strategies in 1995.  AT&T -- hoping to leverage
what it saw as a trend toward meshed networks and encourage users to
add more network sites -- lowered the price of permanent virtual cir-
cuits (PVCs) by 65 percent to 85 percent and raised its frame relay
port charges by 35 percent to 45 percent (See BNN, April 18, 1995).  
     Sprint pursued a different pricing tactic to attract customers,
offering a very low-cost, zero committed information rate (CIR)
service for users needing no more than four PVCs (See BNN, June 27,
1995).  
     MCI took yet a third track.  The carrier eliminated the mileage
bands that had been associated with its service and offered usage-
based billing, which should prove attractive to low-usage customers
(See BNN, Oct. 3, 1995).  Expect more pricing changes in 1996 as
carriers continue to seek new methods for luring customers to their 
networks and as the FCC has required that all facilities-based
carriers file frame relay tariffs.
     Carriers also increased the robustness of their frame relay
services. In 1995, LDDS Worldcom was the most aggressive of the long
distance carriers at pursing network-to-network interface (NNI) agree-
ments with local and international providers.  Worldcom offers NNI
service in 31 domestic cities via interconnections with all of the
regional holding companies and other local carriers.  Some
international agreements are also in place.  The links allow Worldcom
to extend its network reach and to provide customers with lower cost
local access.
     AT&T unveiled a strong suite of frame relay disaster recovery
options, while Sprint launched a managed frame relay access device
(FRAD) service for Systems Network Architecture (SNA) users.  MCI
sought to expand customer access to its frame relay network by
offering a wide array of remote access options.  (See BNN, Nov. 28,
1995; Oct. 3, 1995; and Nov. 14, 1995)

  ...ATM Infrastructure Buildout

     In the wide area ATM arena, carriers continued building their
initial infrastructures in preparation for expected customer demand. 
LDDS Worldcom, Sprint, Ameritech Corp., GTE Corp., and MFS Datanet
were among those that upgraded their ATM networks in 1995.  ATM also
proved to be a successful carrier backbone solution for transporting
frame relay traffic.
     Although few customers actually are buying native ATM services,
carriers experimented with new service offerings designed to make ATM
easier to use and to tempt customers to test the service.  Sprint
launched low-speed T-1 ATM as well as a frame relay-to-ATM service
interworking offering.  Both services provide a migration strategy for
frame relay users that may need additional capacity in their congested
sites and also offer users a lower-cost option for experimenting with
ATM.  Other carriers are expected to launch similar services.
     Worldcom became the first carrier to offer available bit rate
(ABR) ATM based on StrataCom's early implementation of ABR
capabilities on its BPX switch.  As the ATM Forum's traffic management
specifications solidify in 1996, expect additional vendors and
carriers to roll out products and services based on the much
anticipated ABR spec.
     MFS Datanet took a unique approach to running voice traffic over
its ATM backbone.  Although MFS Datanet's WAVE offering is based on a
proprietary solution that utilizes Nortel's Magellan Passport ATM
switch, the service demonstrates MFS' ability to develop easy-to-use
ATM solutions.  Customers don't have to change their networks, but can
continue using their existing PBX systems and data networking
equipment to transport data and voice traffic over variable bit rate
(VBR) ATM (See BNN, Sept. 5, 1995).
     This ability to make ATM transparent to users will be critical
for attracting customers to the service.  Carriers and vendors that do
this well will have an advantage in 1996, and recognition of this fact
is demonstrated by the surge of interest that developed in the second
half of 1995 for wide area ATM access products. Several vendors
including ADC Kentrox, OnStream Networks, and Premisys  began shipping
or unveiled plans to produce wide area ATM access products.  This
trend is sure to continue in 1996.

  ...Offering End-to-End Solutions

    Another key trend that evolved throughout 1995 in the ATM arena
was the importance of offering customers end-to-end solutions that
encompass both local and wide area networks.  Some vendors, Newbridge
Networks for example, concentrated on developing their own products
that span both the LAN and WAN, while others like FORE Systems and
Nortel pursued partnerships that involved joint product development as
well as co-marketing.  Acquisitions and partnerships are likely to
continue in 1996.  Smaller firms likely will attempt to increase their
market presence by merging with each other, and large companies will
gobble up startups with unique and innovative products.

  ...SMDS, The Sleeper Service

    Although SMDS is not expected to achieve frame relay's popularity,
several developments in 1995 will help spur additional sales.  Many
local carriers rolled out low-speed SMDS, which should prove popular
with firms wanting to add remote sites to the corporate network.  
    The growth of image intensive applications in the printing and
medical communities is expected to continue in 1996, and SMDS has
proven popular in these industries.  Pricing changes by MCI, which
eliminated the service's usage minimums, also should lower the
barriers to entry for companies wanting to move to the new service.  
    The Internet proved a boon to all three broadband technologies in
1995, as companies bought circuits from carriers for access and
vendors sold products to build high-speed Internet backbones.  As
local telcos continue their move into the Internet access business in
1996, vendors and carriers with products and services that perform
well in the Internet environment are expected to prosper.

RACAL GETS BARGAIN BRITISH NETWORK

     Racal Electronics has beaten four or five other would-be buyers
on the Department of Transport's shortlist with a successful bid to
acquire BR Telecommunications (BRT) from the British Railways Board. 
Racal will pay Pounds 132.75 million ($204.5 million) to acquire BRT.
    BRT's business principally consists of providing
telecommunications services to Railtrack and the railway operating
companies.  With some 6,900 miles of trunk cable and 10,000 miles of
branch cables, BRT is the largest telecommunications infrastructure
network operator in the U.K. other than British Telecom, Mercury, and
military establishments. 
    The BRT network provides voice, data, and radio network services;
private circuits; and a range of customer premise equipment.  The
company employs around 2,800 people based at some 180 locations
throughout the U.K.  The business is divided into four operating
sections: 
    *  Networks. Provides and manages fixed and mobile
telecommunications network services.
    *  Carrier Services. Provides dark fiber, management of tele-
communications wayleaves, and management of pay phones and other
property-based assets.
    *  Maintenance. Provides maintenance of equipment and
telecommunications and electronic systems.
    *  Projects and Works. Comprises a project engineering and
installation service for the supply of telecommunications networks,
systems, and equipment.

  ...Competitive Position Strengthened

    BRT will become a separate subsidiary within the Racal Network
Services
group, managed on a fully integrated basis with the other businesses. 
The acquisition is expected to strengthen Racal's competitive position
to provide managed network services and to enhance the prospects for
the Racal Group as a whole.  BRT's fiber-based network will provide
access to extensive telecommunications circuits and telecommunications
wayleaves over Railtrack and British Railways Board property.  The
integration of BRT with other Racal Network Services businesses will
result in cost savings through improved utilization of BRT capacity,
sharing of assets, and avoiding duplication of functions within the
enlarged group.
    Ownership of the BRT network and its capabilities will enhance the
prospect of securing substantial and strategically important
commercial and government contracts.  Racal's existing work force will
be strengthened through the addition of the skilled engineering and
national maintenance staff employed by BRT.
    Commenting on the acquisition, Racal Chairman Sir Ernest Harrison
said, "There is considerable growth potential for BRT in both the rail
community and other related markets within the fast-moving managed
telecommunications sector, where Racal has an outstanding record... 
As the turnkey contractor responsible for the installation and
maintenance of the entire voice and data communications infrastructure
for the Channel tunnel, Racal has particular expertise in the rail
environment, and we believe that the acquisition of BRT will bring
substantial benefits to both parties."
    Racal won the contract to establish the Government Data Network --
which remains one of Europe's largest private data network -- in 1989,
and also manages the communications requirements of a growing number
of major companies. Despite losing out to Mercury to provide managed
communications services for the police and for NatWest Bank, Racal
gained a full telecom license in 1994, and has in excess of 300,000
customers for its voice, data, and messaging services.
    Because BRT is a member (with a 7.7 percent share) of the
pan-European rail communications consortium, which is building an
optical network, there will be opportunities for Racal to expand into
continental Europe as well.  (Contact: Racal, +44 1734 66 99 69)

SPECIFICATION WORK CONTINUES, ATM FORUM CONTEMPLATES GOALS FOR 1996

     With an eye toward sending its work out for final vote at the
February meeting, the traffic management, signaling, and private
network-to-network interface working groups of the ATM Forum addressed
the initial round of straw vote comments received regarding their
respective specifications.  Work on all three documents is progressing
in tandem so that the provisions in each will align.
    George Dobrowski, chairman of the technical committee and director
of broadband switching and signaling for Bell Communications Research,
reported that group members clarified various points in all three
specs.  Regarding the provisions for allowed cell rate, members
decided that ATM switches, rather than network interface cards, would
be responsible for governing allowed cell rates. 
    "By putting the function in the switch, it allows us to eliminate
two quality of service (QOS) parameters, so it simplifies the traffic
management and signaling procedures.  It also reduces the cost of
implementation in the network interface cards," Dobrowski said.  He
added that switches can better bear those implementation costs because
they are spread over more users.

  ...International Interoperability Addressed

    The groups determined that support for the internationally defined
QOS classes (i.e. A,B,C,D) is mandatory, whereas the parameter
approach defined by the ATM Forum will be optional.  However, as
Dobrowski explained, "If you do specify [the parameters] and the
device is able to understand them, then the parameter approach will
take precedence over QOS classes because it gives you more precision." 
He added that the QOS class approach is the only one included in the
international standards and that vendors wanting to sell equipment in
Europe need to use an internationally recognized standard.  "This
addresses the interoperability concerns that people had between
equipment based on ITU standards versus ATM Forum implementations,"
Dobrowski said.
    In the signaling arena, the group solidified negotiation
procedures.  "With the previous release of the signaling spec, if the
connection point couldn't accept your request, you had to start the
connection all over again," Dobrowski explained.  "Now, some
negotiation will be possible.  Users can access or reject or adjust
downward their initial request and go forward with it."   The result
is faster connections, as users won't need to resend certain signaling
messages if network capacity is not available to meet their bandwidth
requirements.
    Other specs out for final ballot include the DS-3 direct mapping
physical layer interface, an addendum to the 155 unshielded twisted
pair (UTP) physical layer interface, the native ATM services semantic
description (or ATM application programming interface), the Protocol
Implementation Conformance Statement (PIC) for UTP 3, and the
conformance abstract test suite for AAL type 5.  A clarifying LAN
emulation addendum also was released.

  ...Reevaluation Underway

    As work nears completion on many critical issues before the ATM
Forum, members are closely examining the role the body will take in
the future.  "We are going through a strategic planning process,
identifying potential work areas or what holes exist in providing end-
to-end ATM connections.  We will go through a debate and voting
process to pick out high priority items," Dobrowski said.  He said
that so far the group has identified 21 potential work areas, and that
in April the technical committee will restructure its working groups
and make new assignments.  Although he wouldn't commit the committee
to any specific areas, Dobrowski noted that, "The item which received
the most attention at the last meeting was wireless ATM.  It's still
early to say, but that seemed to have very broad support and...that is
a candidate for new work."

BT SETS NEW SPEED RECORD FOR FIBER.  

    Scientists and engineers at BT Laboratories, Martlesham, have used
photonic technology to shatter world speed records for broadband
superhighways.  They have designed a new type of telecommunications
network, based entirely on the transmission of laser beams through
optical fiber, using devices that almost completely can eliminate
conventional electronic circuits.
    Key elements for this "supernet of the 21st century" are new
photonic components invented and built at Martlesham.  These include
an optical transistor, which BT claims is capable of processing
information at 80 Gbps, and a high-speed optical switch many times
smaller than existing designs.
    These are the basic building blocks used to construct an
all-optical telephone exchange that can read information from a packet
of data at a rate of 100 Gbps, decode the identity of the intended
recipient, and switch the packet onto its destination path.  BT
anticipates bringing this technology out of the lab during 1996, and
building a working prototype photonic network.  The prototype network
will use the existing optical fiber linking six towns in South East
England to allow the new devices to be tested in real working
conditions.  (Contact: BT Labs, +44 1473 647 448)

ASCOM BUILDS CAMBRIDGE ATM NETWORK.  

    Ascom Timeplex, in cooperation with Switzerland-based research
division Ascom Tech, has designed and built an ATM network for the
Language Center at the University of Cambridge.  The basic ring
operates at 1.25 Gbps across existing dark fiber.  It provides 25 Mbps
ATM to desktop PCs via a broadband solution that includes
transmission, switching, access, servers, and multimedia applications.
    The network, installed as part of a European Commission RACE
project called HIPERNET, is designed to facilitate language learning
through technology and involves equipment and support from IBM,
GEC-Marconi, VTT, AND Software, CAP SESA, and the University of
Cambridge.  While currently only serving seven PCs and a server,
located at five sites spanning a total path of about 15 kilometers,
the project eventually will address the problems of using ATM across a
campus extending 50 kilometers, and a user base of several hundred.

LAN SWITCHING HUB MARKET GROWING: GOOD NEWS FOR CARRIER ATM SALES

     According to a new report by The Insight Research Corp., "The LAN
to WAN Interface: LAN Switching Hubs and the Advance of ATM Networking
1995-2000," the growth in the LAN hub market is an indicator of the
future potential of ATM switch sales and of wide area ATM sales by
carriers.  Insight believes that the growing LAN switching hub market
is good news for the ATM industry because such hubs provide a
migration path to ATM, while still allowing companies to maximize the
use of their legacy systems. 
    "LAN switching hubs are the immediate solution and will provide an
easy migration to ATM switching platforms when their use becomes
widespread toward the end of the decade," said Robert Rosenberg,
president of Insight.
    The research firm predicts that shipments of LAN hubs in the
United States will grow from $4.6 billion in 1995 to $14.9 billion by
the year 2000.  Worldwide hub revenues are targeted to increase from
$6.2 billion to $19.7 billion in 2000 (see box).  In its report,
Insight outlines a variety of strategies that carriers can use to
capture a piece of this growing market.

  ...Technical Cooperation Encouraged 

    Carriers are encouraged to promote close alliances with switch
manufacturers and to freely exchange technical information with
vendors.  "If the switch manufacturer has access to the technical
details of the carrier's network operations, the switch manufacturer
can then design products which work well with the carrier's public
data service," writes Insight.  "The user would be assured of both the
network performance and the compatibility between the carrier's
network and the LAN switch."
    Insight also believes that using wide area ATM to support a LAN
interconnection service offers carriers significant opportunities for
growth.  It recommends that service providers:
    *  Strictly adhere to ATM standards.  Compliance will ensure that
procedures such as congestion control are uniform across both local
and long-distance networks and that interconnection is transparent to
users.
    *  Provide cost-effective ATM service pricing.  The cost of
deploying ATM needs to be justifiable initially for data traffic only.
    *  Use flexible connections.  Provide a simple tariff based on
port bandwidth capacity and avoid the complexities of frame relay
pricing.
    *  Provide competitive differentiation.  Value-added features and
industry-specific applications can help carriers distinguish their
services from pure ATM transport offerings.  
    A complete copy of the report is available from Insight Research
for $3,495.  For more information, call Insight at 201/605-1400.

SNET Applies for Statewide Cable Franchise in Connecticut, Abandons
VDT Approach

     In a rejection of the video dial-tone (VDT) model, Southern
New England Telecommunications Corp. has announced that a new
subsidiary, SNET Personal Vision, Inc., will ask the Connecticut
Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) for a statewide cable
TV franchise.  The 76-channel video offering would compete directly
with incumbent cable TV operators statewide and would offer
"competitively priced" services.

     For example, the company will offer near-video-on-demand at
"much greater frequency" than cable TV pay-per-view offerings in
the state, said Patrice Listfield, President of SNET Personal
Vision.  In addition, she said subscribers will be able to call up
movies from remote controls.  At CTR's deadline, the company was
planning to apply on Jan. 25 for the franchise.

     With the announcement, SNET becomes the latest telephone
company to reject a VDT model.  Ameritech Corp. already has signed
cable franchise agreements in several towns in its service area. 
Regarding SNET, Ms. Listfield said the company will continue its
350-subscriber VDT trial in West Hartford until that area can be
included in its cable operations.  Meanwhile, the company plans to
withdraw all its pending VDT applications at the FCC.  "We just
don't want to keep Connecticut customers waiting," she said.

     Ms. Listfield declined to say whether the company always will
price services at rates below existing cable TV rates, adding, "We
don't aim to [offer service] at higher prices."  She said SNET
Personal Vision will be the first company to bundle local exchange
service and cable TV offerings in the same package.  "We are paving
the way," she said.  "This is unprecedented."

     SNET's plan is unique because it would bypass hundreds of
potentially lengthy franchise negotiations with local governments. 
Connecticut is one of the few states that oversee cable TV
franchises at the state level.  Most states leave that authority to
individual cities.

     SNET Personal Vision will deploy a hybrid fiber optic/coaxial
cable network and hopes for DPUC approval by mid-December, Ms.
Listfield said.  She said no cross-subsidization will occur between
the company's cable and telephone operations, in accordance with
state and federal law.  The SNET Personal Vision subsidiary may use
Southern New England Telephone Co. facilities, but it will pay fees
or rent as would a separate company, she said.  Hoshang Mulla, Vice
President-network planning for SNET, said Personal Vision will
present "a very well thought out and extremely fair and proper
proposal" to the DPUC that guards against cross-subsidization.  

     He added that network upgrades in progress will boost
efficiency so much that the cost of providing telephone service can
recede as the video operations are deployed.  Mr. Mulla also said
new technology will allow the video network to continue operating
during power outages, as occurs with SNET's existing local
telephone service.

     Ms. Listfield declined to discuss possible cross-promotion
activities that could stem from SNET's combined video, local
telephone, and long distance operations, but she predicted tie-ins
between the company's business contacts from its printed directory
division and cable TV advertising sales.  "We certainly look to
capitalize on those relationships," she said.  She added that
Personal Vision will use results of the West Hartford trial to help
facilitate the cable TV deployment.

     The company said it expects its upgraded system to reach 36%
of Connecticut homes and business by the end of 1998, with 64% of
the state completed by the year 2000 and full deployment by 2009. 
That schedule coincides with the $4.5 billion upgrade plan that
SNET announced about two years ago, officials said.  Among
communities where the build-out will be complete by the end of 1998
are Bethel, Bloomfield, Branford, Bristol, Darien, East Haven,
Fairfield, Farmington, Meriden, Milford, New Britain, Norwalk, Old
Greenwich, Stamford, Stratford, Wallingford, West Hartford, and
Westport.  Also by 1998, the system will be partially complete in
Bridgeport (65%), Danbury (89%), Hartford (17%), New Haven (70%),
North Haven (79%), Plymouth (55%), Trumbull (16%), West Haven
(98%), and Weston (92%), Personal Vision said.

     Personal Vision said it expects to deploy the service in
portions of Darien, Fairfield, Norwalk, Stamford, Weston, Westport,
Farmington, New Britain, and West Hartford within "a few months"
from the time it receives regulatory approval.  In addition, SNET
plans to engage in negotiations with NYNEX Corp. in Greenwich, and
Woodbury Telephone Co. in Southbury and Bethlehem, to "develop
arrangements that will allow SNET Personal Vision to offer a cable
alternative in those areas."

AT&T's $137.5 Million Deal with DirecTV Enhances Already Powerful
Cable TV Competitor

     AT&T Corp. has acquired a 2.5% equity interest in direct
broadcast satellite (DBS) provider DirecTV, Inc., for $137.5
million.  The deal gives DirecTV marketing access to AT&T's 90
million customers and bolsters its competitive position against the
cable TV industry.  Under the deal, AT&T has the option to increase
its stake to 30% over the next five years, depending on how many
subscribers it enrolls over an unspecified period.  The deal's
price tag puts AT&T's valuation of DirecTV at $5.5 billion.  The
companies said they expect to start joint marketing by mid-1996.

     AT&T chose an equity investment over less involved partnering
schemes to "put your money where your mouth is, so this isn't just
a marketing game," said Joseph Nacchio, Executive Vice President of
AT&T's consumer-small business division.  He declined to disclose
what specific triggers would allow AT&T to increase its investment
but said there will not be another option until at least 1997.

     The purchase, which was announced Jan. 21, came two days
before AT&T was expected to bid for its own DBS license in the
FCC's auction of the remaining orbital slots at 110 and 148 degrees
West Longitude.  Mr. Nacchio said the company opted to buy into
DirecTV because obtaining its own license was expected to cost more
than $1 billion for bidding and system deployment.  

     He said it would have taken at least two years to get the
service off the ground, time that AT&T did not want to cede to
competitors.  DirecTV, on the other hand, is already established
and would allow AT&T to tap the market now, he said.

     Analysts at Merrill Lynch endorsed AT&T's approach.  They
predicted "no significant impact on earnings" but said AT&T's
equity investment strategy is "a smart and sensible way of entering
the home entertainment business."  In addition, they said the move
may have implications for cable TV companies and "makes it somewhat
more imperative" that MCI Communications Corp. step up its efforts
to bid for a DBS slot.

     In addition, AT&T and DirecTV touted the marketing
possibilities.  DirecTV President Eddy Hartenstein said AT&T will
be an "extremely powerful" outlet to promote DirecTV services and
increase its brand identity.  Mr. Nacchio promised that "a lot of
interesting marketing techniques" will come to light over the next
few months.  Plans include allowing customers to use an AT&T credit
card to finance the purchase of the 18-inch satellite dishes
required to receive DirecTV--at "very attractive" interest rates. 


     Mr. Nacchio said 12 million customers now use the card.  In
addition, AT&T will add a DirecTV sales pitch to its telemarketing
and direct sales efforts, and its retail outlets--first established
for wireless sales--will be used to sell DirecTV as well, Mr.
Nacchio said.  He said AT&T also plans regularly to promote DirecTV
in its billing literature.  

     The cable TV industry could use the deal to enhance its
argument that the FCC's "effective competition" standard--outlined
in the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act--should be changed to reflect alleged market realities, some
cable TV industry lawyers confirmed.  The industry has argued, for
instance, that the 1992 Cable Act's effective competition
definition is arbitrary and bears no relation to economic models.

     Under the current rules, a cable TV operator must prove that
a local competitor is accessible to at least 50% of the operator's
potential customers and that the competitor actually has garnered
at least 15% of the operator's current customer base.  The cable TV
industry has argued that DBS services such as DirecTV meet the 50%
standard because they are national businesses.  It has said
competitive pricing pressures occur substantially before 15% of an
incumbent operator's customers are lost.

     The FCC has signaled that it will waive rate regulation on a
case-by-case basis when the local competitive situation merits. 
Seth Davidson, a cable TV lawyer with the Washington firm of
Fleishman and Walsh, cited Bell Atlantic Corp.'s video dial-tone
activities in Dover Township, N.J., which prompted the Commission
to propose a partial waiver of the rate rules for Adelphia Cable
Communications, Inc., the incumbent cable TV operator there. 
AT&T's investment in DirecTV likely offers "one more fact that
people will point to" when cable TV operators request waivers in
the future, he said.

     A spokesman at the National Cable Television Association
(NCTA) said the AT&T investment does not signify a major milestone
in the effective competition debate, but "it makes the argument
that cable TV is operating in a competitive marketplace."  He said
important factors include the "influx of capital" that DirecTV will
receive from AT&T and the benefits of adding AT&T to its national
branding efforts.  He said, however, that the cable TV industry
remains poised to compete with national and regional entities,
noting the industry's continuing efforts to "cluster" its cable TV
operations into regional hubs capable of matching the scale of new
video competitors.

     Competition from DirecTV primarily affects the expanded basic
tier of cable TV services, Mr. Davidson said.  He noted that many
new DirecTV customers keep the lowest cable tier--often mostly
broadcast channels--in addition to DirecTV, which cannot offer
local broadcast stations.  As a result, the FCC has begun to
realize that "this doesn't have to be all or nothing" and that
expanded-tier deregulation can be an adequate relaxation of the
rate rules, he added.  As for the 15% standard, he said, "You do
respond to competitive pressure short of that threshold."  The
proposed 1995 Telecommunications Act pending in Congress would
relax expanded cable TV tier regulation when there is a telephone
company competitor, but the legislation does not contemplate the
same flexibility when there is a DBS presence, according to the
draft conference report.

     Although the basics of the AT&T-DirecTV deal are set, both
companies said several issues remain unresolved.  Mr. Hartenstein
said details "haven't been worked out" about possible changes in
arrangements with DBS satellite dish manufacturers.  It is also
unclear whether AT&T's newly spun-off equipment division will have
a manufacturing role, Mr. Nacchio said, but "we're considering it." 
Mr. Hartenstein said he expects nine or 10 dish brand names to
surface by mid-summer.  He said DirecTV also has not determined
whether the transaction will lead to changes in the service's
programming lineup or will spur a combined effort with AT&T to
provide interactive and data services.  He said negotiations are
under way regarding an online service venture but declined to give
details.  "We are well aware of the 30 million PC households," he
said.

     Some have speculated that DirecTV might strike a deal with
NBC, Inc., which recently announced a partnership with Microsoft
Corp. to turn its America's Talking cable network into a
combination news channel/online service.  Mr. Hartenstein said
DirecTV has not held "specific discussions" with NBC, but "we most
likely will."

     Cable TV industry sources said the AT&T-DirecTV announcement
will present another competitive hurdle for the industry, which has
expressed concern over DirecTV's ability to garner 1.2 million
customers in only 18 months.  Others said the deal calls into
question the assumption that AT&T eventually will use the cable TV
industry's infrastructure to resell local telephone service.  AT&T
long has criticized the local exchange access charges assessed by
telcos.  Mr. Nacchio said the deal is not expected to affect AT&T's
future relationship with the cable TV industry, which "has to deal
with the future as we have to deal with it."  He argued that AT&T
is still "an attractive partner" for cable TV companies.

     New telecommunications alliances based on one-stop-shopping
business models increasingly may force "competitors and
collaborators" to mingle, said Paul Glist, a cable TV industry
lawyer at Cole, Raywid and Braverman in Washington.  He said the
cable industry always has cited "natural alliances" with long
distance companies (although the two industries have disagreed on
significant provisions in the telecom bill now pending in
Congress).  "What does this [the AT&T-DirecTV deal] mean for the
long-term relationship?" he asked.

     As the telecommunications industry becomes more consolidated,
companies are bound to intertwine in some business areas while
competing in others, Mr. Glist said.  Another cable lawyer said the
AT&T-DirecTV deal suggests that DBS competition is "quite real. . .
[It has] a real competitive impact" and "further bolsters what
we've been saying all along" about DBS as a serious competitive
threat.  DirecTV is a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., which is
owned by General Motors Corp.

NCTA Revives Customer Service Campaign As Competition from Telcos
Looms

     The National Cable TV Association (NCTA) has revived last
year's "on-time" guarantee program, partly to gain ground against
telephone companies, which are perceived widely as providing better
customer service as they prepare to enter video markets.  An NCTA
spokesman noted "a positive movement in the needle" of public
perception concerning the cable industry's customer service record
since the guarantee was implemented in March 1995.  He admitted,
however, that the cable TV industry still lags behind telcos in the
public's mind.  "If we were ahead, we would not be so committed to
a program like 'The Future Is on Cable,'" the industry's title of
the overall customer service campaign.  Under the program,
participating cable TV operators offer to meet appointment
"windows" or issue a $20 rebate to the customer.

     Although the customer service campaign got off to a
much-publicized start last year and was followed by a flurry of
national advertising, it has fizzled considerably in recent months. 
Not only did every broadcast network except News Corp.'s Fox refuse
to run the ads, citing competitive reasons, but the cable TV
industry has had to focus its efforts on the pending
telecommunications reform legislation.

     NCTA has announced several changes in the campaign--including
a shift from national to local advertising, with more emphasis on
local system branding to counter the greater name recognition of
the Bell companies.  The NCTA spokesman also noted that local
advertising will allow each cable TV operator to customize its
message to a specific local competitive situation.

     Char Beales, President and Chief Operating Officer of Cable &
Telecommunications:  A Marketing Society (CTAM), said during a
recent satellite teleconference that CTAM will send several
marketing and public relations kits to local system operators in
the next few weeks.  Included will be videotapes of short
commercials touting the campaign.  She urged systems to run the
shorts at least three times daily on at least 10 channel slots. 
NCTA President Decker Anstrom said the industry has not yet
conducted a "thorough market study" of its customer service
performance over the last year, but he stressed that "there's no
quick fix" to the service problems of the past.  "We don't expect
to win the whole game in the first year," he said, but the cable TV
industry needs "changes in behavior."  He said that is "the reason
we're going to beat our competition in the months and years ahead."

     John Hendricks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Discovery Communications, Inc., noted that he once chased down a
cable TV maintenance truck in an attempt to receive service.  He
said the industry needs to leave "the truck-chasing days" behind it
as competition develops.

     The NCTA spokesman said that despite the public's different
perception of the cable TV and telephone industries, most telcos
are "looking more toward those kinds of technologies that are
suited to cable-style infrastructures."

     That means the cable TV industry is ahead in terms of network
capabilities, he said.  He maintained that a cable TV company's
hybrid fiber optic/coaxial network can handle up to about 25% of
its users on the network simultaneously, while most current copper
telco lines can handle only 10%.  Although many telcos are
upgrading to fiber facilities, he said, the cable TV industry may
be able to take an early bite out of the telecom market before
telcos are up to speed.

     Mr. Hendricks said one of the first areas that cable TV
operators hope to pry from the telcos is access to online services. 
The industry has spent the last few months touting the faster data
transmission rates of cable modems when compared to current telco
alternatives (CTR, Jan. 12).  He said cable-related Web sites also
can promote local cable systems by giving online users information
about their local cable TV operators based on the users' zip codes.

Cable TV Companies Embrace Use of ATM Technology, but Not to the
Home

By Judith Freeman Mills

     About two years ago, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) was a
new technology, far from being well-known, standardized, or cheap. 
Today some major cable TV system operators are deploying ATM
switches, championing a technology developed to move vast amounts
of digital data, video, and voice communications simultaneously and
at extremely high speeds.  ATM networks can route and switch
information over a large geographic area, unlike other available
systems.

     Continental Cablevision, Inc., and Time Warner Cable have
concluded from their own experiences with ATM networks that for the
foreseeable future, ATM is the preferred, cost-effective technology
for building the backbone of a broadband digital communications
network.  But they also have concluded that ATM networks are not
the preferable connections to homes.

     Key to their conclusion is the belief that one-way video
channels, such as Cable News Network or pay-per-view offerings,
will continue to dominate consumer television.  This view also
affects their ideas about set-top boxes.  

     They believe that set-top units should be built first to
handle MPEG-II (Motion Picture Experts Group) digital video and
later adapted to handle interactive services, not the other (more
expensive) way around.

     Officials at Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs),
the cable TV industry's research and development arm based in
Louisville, Colo., are tracking the development of ATM technology
closely.  They continue to question when it will be fully developed
and economically sensible.

     Time Warner has 4,000 households on its state-of-the-art Full
Service Network in Orlando, Fla.  The FSN was built as a laboratory
to test services that could be available on a broadband network: 
one-way video, impulse pay-per-view programming, home shopping and
banking, computer data transmission and Internet access, video
conferencing, distance education, and local and long distance
telephone services.  The system also features ATM switching all the
way to the home.

     Based on what Time Warner has learned, the company will not
repeat the architecture, says Michael Adams, Time Warner Cable's
Senior ATM Project Engineer.  Instead, he advocates the use of ATM
technology from the headend (or "network operations center") out,
but not into residential neighborhoods as MPEG-format streams on a
now-standard hybrid fiber optic/coaxial cable network.  ATM
technology would be used only for the so-called backbone.  Mr.
Adams prefers the following architecture:

     Interactive video service providers transmit their programming
to a network operator, where it is stored on media servers or
massive computer storage banks (media servers also store movies and
other pay-per-view fare).  When needed, the programming is moved
onto the operator's core ATM switched network.

     From there the interactive digital programming enters an
Interactive Cable Gateway (ICG), the outer or ending edge of the
ATM backbone where the ATM signals are converted to an MPEG-II
format.  Separately, one-way satellite-delivered digital video
channels (such as CNN or the Discovery Channel) arrive at the
operator's headend and are sent to a Broadcast Cable Gateway. 
These signals would be in MPEG format.

     Both gateways feed into the hybrid fiber/coax network, which
then sends the transmissions into neighborhoods, through
neighborhood optical nodes, and into subscriber homes.  Under this
scenario, transmissions outside the ATM backbone network would be
in the MPEG-II format--a digital format that is becoming standard
for compression and transmission of digital video signals.  The
home set-top box would be MPEG-II; operators would not need to pay
for set-top boxes that also are capable of reading ATM streams.

     Regarding the actual architecture of the Time Warner FSN, each
interactive service provider's programming is stored on media
servers.  From the server the programming enters the system's core
ATM network and goes through an Interactive Cable Bridge (ICB),
remaining in an ATM format.  Meanwhile, satellite-delivered video
channels enter the system's Broadcast Cable Gateway.  The ICB and
the BCG pass the ATM and MPEG signals on to the fiber optic/coaxial
cable network, which connects to subscriber homes.

     Subscriber set-top boxes must deal with "both MPEG-II and ATM
transports and. . .switch between them when switching from
interactive to broadcast programming," Mr. Adams says.  The FSN
uses AT&T Network Systems' GlobeView-2000 ATM switch, which has a
maximum throughput rate of 20 gigabits per second (20 billion bits
per second).

     Under either architecture, at the end user's home or office a
set-top box and/or a separate cable modem handles necessary signal
conversions and routing to a TV set, computer, or telephone.  "Both
(architectures) can be made to work," Mr. Adams says.  "However,
for near-term deployment of cable networks, the first option is
better for economic and technical reasons."

     Ending the ATM portion of the network at the gateway makes
sense "for the pretty long term," he adds.  "So long as we have
[one-way cable TV or broadcast TV] services and lay on digital
interactive video, which we believe is the correct order, this
makes sense."  He notes, though, that the ATM Forum of senior
telecommunications engineers has been talking about wiring
individual homes with internal ATM networks.  "Pretty spacey," he
says.

     Time Warner's FSN in Orlando deploys ATM technology to the
home partly because, when the project started, MPEG-II compression
and transmission were not well defined or standardized and did not
carry data well.  "Now, it is well defined, and there is good
mapping of data," Mr. Adams notes.  "So it is pretty future-proof."

     Time Warner, Tele-Communications, Inc., and other operators
field-testing Microsoft's ATM-based Interactive Television (MITV)
system--and other network programmers and system operators as well-
-will begin transmitting signals in the advanced MPEG-II format
this year.

     Set-top boxes used by direct satellite TV systems DirecTV and
PrimeStar are "very close, if not exactly, MPEG-II capable," Mr.
Adams says.  He points out that TELE-TV, a video programming
venture involving several Bell regional holding companies, and
other companies are placing big orders for MPEG-II-capable set-top
boxes.

     Although MPEG-I and -II were developed specifically for video
streams, technical standards have been agreed upon for MPEG-II to
handle data and voice transmissions accurately, Mr. Adams says. 
Therefore, his recommended architecture could handle any service a
network operator might want to offer consumers, he notes.  (The
Orlando FSN currently is testing one-way and interactive on-demand
video programming.  It will add telephone and computer-based data
services as the project progresses.)

     Deploying an ATM network all the way to the end user might
make sense in a business park, where customers need major
multimedia, desktop videoconferencing, and other high-tech
services, Mr. Adams continues.  

     Today many local area networks serving major business parks or
corporate campuses already have ATM switches installed, making it
easy for the broadband plant operator to continue the line, he
notes.  Mr. Adams says he has no hesitation about deploying
ATM-switched backbone networks.  Today "ATM is in such good shape
in terms of standardization and interoperability," he adds.

     "ATM is installed, working, and stable, and we're glad" to be
using it, says David Fellows, Senior Vice President-engineering and
technology for Continental Cablevision.  Continental installed an
ATM backbone network to physically interconnect its New England
cable systems.  The 200-mile fiber optic infrastructure includes
Kittery, Maine; Portsmouth and Concord, N.H.; Boston, Marion,
Needham, Newton, Northampton, and Reading, Mass.; and Enfield,
Conn.  The engineering control center is in Reading.

     What had been individual system headends are now nodes on the
ATM backbone.  Continental is using Lightstream-2020 ATM switches. 
"ATM was installed in anticipation of rolling out high-speed data,"
Mr. Fellows reports.  Continental also uses its ATM network to send
digital commercials out to systems for insertion on channel
lineups, for inter-company data transmission and mail, for employee
Internet access, and for inter-company telephony.

     Video programming for the cable systems is sent on a parallel
fiber cable, not the ATM network, Mr. Fellows says.  Because the
two fiber networks were built at the same time using the same
trenches, the economic impact of adding more fiber to carry the
cable video separately was "basically not a big deal," he explains.

     Unlike Time Warner's FSN, which is running MPEG video over its
ATM network, "we're not contemplating running our core video on the
ATM network," Mr. Fellows says.  "At the moment we don't need to." 
But when demand arises for real-time interactive video services,
then "ATM is the way we think we're going to do that," he says.

     For now, Mr. Fellows agrees with Mr. Adams' conclusion that an
ATM network should end at a hybrid fiber/coax system and that all
video, data, and voice communications should be sent to residential
neighborhoods via MPEG-II transport.  He questions when, and at
what price, set-top boxes will handle both ATM and MPEG-II
transmissions.

     Continental started studying such a high-speed information
highway about two years ago.  At that time, Mr. Fellows notes, the
company explored the use of fiber digital data interconnect (FDDI)
technology, which was considered reliable.  "But it couldn't go 200
miles, so we knew at some point we would need to switch to ATM," he
says.  At that time, however, ATM was not 100% ready for
deployment.

13th Reconsideration Order Helps--and Hinders--Cable TV Rate
Regulation

By Nicholas P. Miller and Rick Ellrod--Miller, Canfield, Paddock
and Stone, P.L.C.

     The primary goal of the FCC's 13th order on reconsideration in
its cable TV rate regulation proceeding is to encourage cable TV
operators to seek rate increases annually rather than quarterly;
most operators have sought quarterly increases under previous
rules.  The FCC's Sept. 22, 1995, order added the new annual filing
method as another option in the existing rules, rather than
replacing the quarterly rules.

     For cable TV operators, the benefits of the annual rate
adjustment filing include the reduction of delays in recovering
costs and the elimination of a potential loss of revenue under the
current rules.  Another benefit is a reduction in administrative
burdens on regulators.  The benefit to subscribers is "reduced
confusion" from multiple rate increases.

     The order makes several other significant changes in rate
review, most of which appear to be favorable to cable operators. 
These changes affect regulatory procedures, review deadlines,
franchise requirements subject to pass-through, and basic and cable
programming service-tier increases.

     The 13th reconsideration order adopts an annual rate
adjustment methodology designed to permit operators to recover
projected cost increases by filing a new FCC Form 1240.  The form
was scheduled to be released in December but has been delayed
because of the recent government shutdown.  This method will allow
recovery of "reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable"
changes in external costs, inflation, and the number of regulated
channels that are projected for the next year.

     A "true-up" mechanism will reconcile the difference between
projected and actual costs at the next annual filing.  But it also
will add another layer to the already complex rate review process
and could further complicate a franchising authority's ability to
determine whether the operator is charging reasonable rates.  The
projected costs fall into the following categories:

     *    Inflation projections will use an estimate issued by the
FCC each September, based on the preceding 12 months' inflation.

     *    External costs may be projected if they are reasonably
certain and reasonably quantifiable.  Copyright fees,
retransmission consent fees, other programming costs, FCC
regulatory fees, and cable-specific taxes are presumed to be
reasonably certain and quantifiable.

     This presumption does not affect an operator's duty to respond
to reasonable requests for information from a franchising
authority.  It also does not extend to the costs of new franchise
requirements, which may be projected only if the operator shows
that the anticipated increases are reasonably certain and
quantifiable.  The cable operator has the burden of proving that
costs are reasonably certain and quantifiable.

     *    Rate increases for projected channel additions are
generally applied once a year.  But an operator may make one
additional adjustment at any time during the year for any number of
new cable programming service (CPS) channels, or for basic channels
if there is only a single tier.  In addition, if channel additions
are required by federal or local law (that is, for "must-carry";
local origination; public, educational and governmental [PEG]
access; or leased access channels), it appears that an operator may
pass through the costs of such additions immediately.

     Costs projected in the annual adjustment are passed through to
subscribers in 12 equal monthly installments.  If an operator
elects not to pass through such costs, it may accrue them with
interest for a later rate increase.  Under the annual method, the
FCC stipulates that cable operators retain the right to increase
rates later if they do not take the increase at the beginning of
the rate year.

     Interest ceases to accrue, however, if the operator
deliberately postpones a rate increase.  The FCC has ruled in
earlier proceedings that 11.25% is presumptively the cost of
capital for cable operators, and interest will be charged at this
amount.  Curiously, the interest rate for refunds to subscribers is
still the IRS rate for tax refunds:  8%.

     In addition to reconciling projected and actual costs, the
"true-up" mechanism creates an opportunity for cable operators to
recover lost subscriber revenues when a franchising authority has
denied a rate increase that later is overturned by the FCC.  

     Until now, the FCC routinely has granted stays of local rate
orders because operators might suffer irreparable harm and could
not recover lost subscriber revenues under the current rules.  The
FCC's rationale for granting the stays has been removed, however,
because the "true-up" mechanism will allow the recovery of such
revenues.

     Equipment rates will be adjusted annually on the same date as
service-tier rates are changed.  Thus, an operator using the annual
method will file FCC Form 1205 on the same day it files Form 1240. 
However, actual past costs rather than projected costs still will
be used to determine equipment rates.

     The date of the annual adjustment normally is chosen by the
cable TV operator.  But the operator first must notify the
franchising authority of the proposed date.  If a proposed
adjustment date is unacceptable, a franchising authority may reject
it for "good cause"--for example, if the review period falls within
the period of a city council recess (a rare recognition by the FCC
of the realities of local government operations).  If the operator
and the franchising authority cannot agree on a date, the
franchising authority may set the filing date up to 60 days later
than that originally proposed by the operator.

Annual Method Involves Changes in Deadlines

     The annual method brings with it a number of procedural
changes, making it more difficult for franchising authorities to
ensure they are complying with the right deadlines.  In general,
annual rate adjustments for the basic tier are filed 90 days before
their planned effective date.  At the end of the 90-day period,
they become effective unless the franchising authority rejects them
as unreasonable, subject to later reduction and refund.

     Under the annual method, the franchising authority need not
issue an accounting order to preserve subscribers' rights to
refunds.  On the other hand, cable operators gain two new ways to
avoid refunds under the annual method:

     (1)   If an operator inquires at the end of the 90-day period
whether the franchising authority still is reviewing the rate
filing, the franchising authority must respond within 15 days or
lose its ability to order future refunds or reductions.

     (2)   If a final rate order is not issued within a year, the
franchising authority appears to lose its right to order refunds or
rate reductions.  The FCC justifies this rule by stating that "one
year should provide ample time for review."  But this may be
surprising news to those communities still waiting, after more than
two years, for the FCC's own review of their CPS rate complaints.

     If there is a material change in the operator's circumstances
during the 90-day period, it may amend its Form 1240 before the
90-day period expires.  If such an amendment is filed less than 30
days before the end of that period, the review period is extended
automatically so that the franchising authority has at least 30
days to review the amendment.  The FCC creates a number of
exceptions to the 90-day review period.  For example, franchising
authorities' review period for the extra midyear adjustment for CPS
channel additions is the same as for the regular annual adjustment
(90 days).

     However, if this midyear adjustment is for a single basic tier
(where there is no CPS tier), the review period shrinks to 60 days. 
A shortened 60-day period also applies to adjustments based on
channel additions that are required by federal or local law.  Sixty
days is also the review period for filings that create a new rate
for newly introduced equipment (submitted using a special
streamlined filing of Form 1205).

     Under current rules, if a franchising authority receives a
"facially incomplete" rate filing, it can require the operator to
submit supplemental information, and the franchising authority's
deadlines for review are tolled.  In the 13th reconsideration
order, however, the FCC says the franchising authority must notify
the operator of such facial incompleteness within 45 days from the
date of the rate filing, at least in the context of the annual
adjustment method.

CPS Rate Increases Also Affected

     Under the prior rules, an operator was not supposed to
increase CPS rates for one year after an FCC-ordered rate
reduction.  Under the annual method, however, the operator
apparently may take its annual increase (regardless of any earlier
rate reduction) by filing Form 1240 with the FCC 30 days before the
planned increase.  The increase then goes into effect subject to
later reduction and refund.

     If both basic and CPS tiers are subject to rate regulation,
the operator must file so that the 90-day period for franchising
authority review coincides with the 30-day period for FCC review. 
The exception is that the operator also may file with the FCC at
the same time it files with the franchising authority.

Fees, Requirements Subject to Pass-through

     The FCC has affirmed its earlier rule allowing operators under
the quarterly method to pass through increases in franchise fees or
FCC regulatory fees within 30 days of filing.  It appears that
under this method, the franchising authority's 30-day order
functions as an accounting order, allowing the new rates to go into
effect subject to future reduction and refund.

     In general, the 13th reconsideration order repeats that only
increases in costs for services specifically required in the
franchise documents may be passed through.  But it also adds a new
criterion:  Only increases "that the operator would not have
incurred in the absence of the franchise requirement" are passed
through.  This rule is consistent with the FCC's notion that
external costs are those beyond the operator's control.  Yet, in
stating this criterion, the FCC is admitting that the benefits
whose costs are allowed as a pass-through exist only because of
local franchising.

     The 13th reconsideration order reiterates that capital
expenditures required by a franchise must be amortized over the
useful life of the items.  But the order contributes a new wrinkle: 
Operators apparently may recover an 11.25% "return on investment"
in addition to such costs.

     The following categories of franchise requirement costs may be
passed through:  technical and customer service standards that
exceed minimum federal requirements; PEG access channels and
programming; institutional networks and the provision of video,
voice, and data services to governmental and educational
institutions; and "undergrounding," to the extent it requires
removing existing cable from poles and placing it underground.  But
increased costs for normal maintenance or simple line extensions
within the franchise area are not passed through, even if such
costs are required by the franchise documents.

Franchise Fee Refund Rules Clarified

     When an operator pays refunds to subscribers, the franchising
authority must return any franchise fee amounts that already have
been paid by the operator based on those refunds.  In the 13th
reconsideration order, the FCC clarifies this obligation by stating
that the franchising authority, not the cable operator, determines
how such franchise fees should be repaid--in a lump sum, or by
offsetting the overcharge against future franchise fee payments. 
Either method may be used as long as the overpayment is returned to
the operator within a "reasonable period of time," depending on the
amount of the overcharge and its relationship to the franchising
authority's budget.

     The order also says the franchising authority must pay
interest on the overpayment at the now-typical 11.25% rate.  This
raises the prospect that the cable operator might make a profit on
the interest, since the operator must repay the franchise fee
amounts to subscribers only at the 8% IRS refund interest rate.

     In some ways the 13th reconsideration order may improve the
rate regulation process.  Most notably a return to annual rate
changes, rather than the quarterly bombardment produced by the
original rules, should be beneficial to both subscribers and
franchising authorities.

     But the FCC has implemented these improvements in a way some
believe is guaranteed to produce further complexity and more
loopholes and disputes.  Moreover, the introduction of several new,
shorter deadlines for special situations will require franchising
authorities to be even more careful to avoid running afoul of one
of the FCC's "sand traps," thus losing the right to overturn
"unreasonable" rates.

Bell Atlantic Enters Final Phase of Dover Township Video Dial-Tone
Test

     Four weeks into its eight-week video dial-tone (VDT) trial in
Dover Township, N.J., Bell Atlantic Corp. has entered the second
and final phase designed to "stress" VDT capabilities and test
basic interactivity.  While the first stage emphasized support
services such as ordering, installation, and general
troubleshooting, the second phase will concentrate on entertainment
programming, "basic interactive functions" (e.g., pay-per-view),
and "text interactivity" (e.g., on-screen ordering of premium
services), a Bell Atlantic spokesman said.  He clarified, however,
that the second phase will not include full interactive functions
such as video-on-demand.

     FutureVision, which is the only one of seven "video
information providers" that have reserved capacity on the
384-channel network to offer programming, will increase its channel
selection and test new concepts during the second phase. 

     Bell Atlantic "did learn some things" about video delivery
during the first phase, including that subscribers experienced "a
short delay" when switching channels, the spokesman said.  He said
the company plans to fix that problem during the second phase by
distributing software upgrades to its subscribers.

     In addition, he said Bell Atlantic has set up voice mail boxes
through its local telephone operations so that subscribers can keep
the company abreast of network problems as they occur.  

     Bell Atlantic also has used the voice mail system to remind
subscribers when specific tests will occur (for example, if the
company wanted to test its pay-per-view capacity by directing a
large number of people to order movies at the same time).

     "We keep in close contact with the volunteers," the spokesman
said.  "We know some of these people by name."  He claimed that
most subscribers prefer Bell Atlantic's digital signal over
incumbent cable TV operator Adelphia Communications Corp.'s current
analog transmissions.  He also noted that many people have remained
on the waiting list to test the VDT network.

     Adelphia has not made a point of questioning Bell Atlantic's
claims of better signal quality, said Randy Fisher, Adelphia
VP-General Counsel.  But the company's interviews with subscribers
testing Bell Atlantic's network indicate "there's not much
difference" between Adelphia's current analog signal and the
telco's digital picture, he said.  "It's a good picture, but it's
not so good as to drive a wooden stake into our heart," he said. 
He suggested that price, service, and network reliability
ultimately will determine which company wins customers, noting that
Adelphia still plans to vie for Bell Atlantic's telephony
customers.

     In the meantime, Mr. Fisher said, Adelphia speedily is
deploying fiber in an attempt to upgrade its network fully by the
time Bell Atlantic rolls out commercial VDT service.  The Bell
Atlantic spokesman said that will occur "in the near future" but
declined to specify a date.  Mr. Fisher noted that digital
transmission still has problems, such as its apparent inability to
handle picture-in-picture TV functions.  So it is still unclear
whether Adelphia will convert to a digital signal once it completes
the upgrade, which Mr. Fisher said is about 60% done.  Industry
working groups have not yet set a digital standard.

Bell Atlantic Defends Dover VDT Tariff

     Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic has filed reply comments with the FCC
defending its VDT tariff for Dover Township.  It accused the cable
TV industry of a "campaign of fear and intimidation, as well as
regulatory gamesmanship" that has "led many carriers to conclude
that the game is not worth the candle:  Rather than pursue the open
network vision, they are wearily agreeing simply to be cable
clones."

     Ameritech Corp., for one, publicly has abandoned the VDT model
and continues to pursue cable TV franchises around the country. 
Bell Atlantic told the Commission that its proposed VDT rates do
cover the cost of providing VDT service, despite the cable TV
industry's claims that they could promote cross-subsidization.  It
also reiterated that the terms and conditions of its VDT tariff are
"commercially reasonable and nondiscriminatory."  Bell Atlantic has
received FCC authority to deploy a VDT network in Dover Township.

     GTE Corp. also has weighed into the Dover Township
controversy.  GTE opposed the FCC's approval of Adelphia's request
for a waiver of the cable rate regulation rules.  Adelphia had made
the request in light of Bell Atlantic's impending VDT deployment. 
GTE said the waiver may do "more to enhance and perpetuate an
asymmetric scheme of regulation than to promote true competition"
and urged the FCC to relax VDT rules as well "so that competition
can flourish."

Time Warner Steps Up Ohio Fight Over Interconnection with Ameritech

     Time Warner Communications has taken a dispute over
interconnection with Ameritech-Ohio one step further, asking the
Ohio Public Utilities Commission to suspend the telephone company's
alternative regulation plan.  Citing its unsuccessful attempt to
negotiate interconnection rates and terms with the telco, Time
Warner has asked the PUC to suspend the intrastate price cap plan
that gave Ameritech broad regulatory flexibility.  Ameritech
responded by calling Time Warner's request "desperate" and
"ridiculous" and accusing the cable TV company of seeking to
"derail" its plans to provide competitive cable TV service.

     Time Warner received authorization last year to provide local
exchange telephony in the 37 counties in which it operates cable TV
systems, pending the development of comprehensive local competition
rules in the state (CTR, Sept. 8, 1995).  But Time Warner and
Ameritech have disagreed on interconnection terms, prompting the
cable TV company late last month to seek PUC mediation of their
negotiations (CTR, Jan. 12).  Time Warner made that request in its
second 60-day report to the commission on the status of those
negotiations.

     Time Warner and Ameritech representatives have met four times
since the mediation request was filed; PUC staff members attended
two of those meetings, Time Warner said.  It filed the motion
because of a "distinct lack of progress despite those efforts,"
said Marsha Schermer, Time Warner Vice President-regulatory
affairs.

     Ameritech was allowed to operate under the alternative
regulation plan because of the onset of local exchange competition,
Ms. Schermer said.  But the telco has taken advantage of the plan,
she added, acting as "virtually an unregulated monopoly, in control
of when and how they get competition."  Time Warner sought
suspension of certain aspects of the regulation plan.

     Ameritech said, however, that "substantive agreements" on many
technical and economic issues have been reached.  But Time Warner
has increased its demands every time the parties near agreement,
said James C. Smith, VP-regulatory for the telco.  He said
Ameritech, which has reached interconnection pacts with six
competitors, has been a "leader" in negotiating such agreements. 
Time Warner has "no incentive to reach an interconnection
agreement," because its "real motive is to delay competition in the
monopoly cable TV market," Mr. Smith said.

     Even if an interconnection agreement is reached, Time Warner
"doesn't seem to be ready to provide generally available local
telephone service in Ohio," he added.  "There are widespread
reports that Time Warner has not been able to deliver generally
available local telephone service in Orlando, Fla., and Rochester,
N.Y."  By contrast, Ameritech is prepared to provide cable TV
services in several Ohio communities, Mr. Smith stated.

     AT&T Corp. has weighed in with support of Time Warner's
motion, citing similar difficulties in negotiating interconnection
terms with Ameritech in Illinois and Michigan.

     Meanwhile, Time Warner has asked the Wisconsin Public Service
Commission for authority to provide switched local exchange
services in that state.  The company plans initially to serve large
and small businesses but eventually will serve residential end
users.  Time Warner also plans to offer (1) video-on-demand, (2)
high-speed access to on-line services and the Internet, (3) home
shopping, and (4) interactive video service.  In Wisconsin it plans
to build a 15,000-mile fiber optic network featuring 24-hour
"system surveillance," redundancy based on synchronous optical
network (SONET) technology, and a fiber optic backbone
architecture.

Pacific Bell Reports Video Dial-Tone Construction Delays in Some
Cities

     Pacific Bell has hit a snag in its attempt to build video
dial-tone (VDT) networks in 24 California cities--namely, most of
the cities themselves, said a Pacific Telesis Group spokesman. 
Although Pacific Bell has received construction approval in San
Jose, he noted, internal disputes between city officials and
concerns over potential disruptions to the public rights-of-way
have delayed local construction approval in most of the other 23
localities.

     In San Jose, Pacific Bell already has wired 200 homes for a
free "technology test."  With a hybrid fiber optic/coaxial network
now passing about 315,000 homes, the company hopes to expand the
trial into a commercial rollout, he said.  "We think it's
definitely going to work," he said, but local "government
ponderousness" is "holding up the network. . .We're stymied."

     Most of the disagreements have centered on money, the Pacific
Telesis spokesman said.  "Initially, they opened their arms," he
said, but then "the dollar signs started to click in their eyes"
and demands for public access channel slots, local fees, and other
forms of revenue surfaced.  The result, he said, is that some
cities purposely are holding Pacific Bell up "in order to shake us
down."

     The company has offered short-term fee arrangements until a
final federal telecom bill clarifies its local responsibilities,
the spokesman continued.  But some cities have demanded long-term
commitments now.  He conceded, however, that cities have a
legitimate concern when it comes to construction schedules, noting
that "we're not the only company that's asking to dig up the
streets."

     The problem for both cities and prospective VDT service
providers is that VDT "is in some flux" because of the pending
federal telecom legislation, said Eileen Huggard, Executive
Director of the National Association of Telecommunications Officers
and Advisors (NATOA).  She said cities want VDT construction to
mesh with other local projects or construction requests in a way
that does not excessively inconvenience local residents.  But
guidelines are unclear because of the pending bill.  "That's part
of why it's a difficult time right now," she said.  "It's trying to
plan for something that could change in a week or two weeks or a
few months."

     Other telcos have reported similar snags but continue to study
what they hope will be a lucrative video marketplace.  A
spokeswoman for U S WEST, Inc., said U S WEST Communications'
ongoing VDT trial in Omaha is in "full swing," with more than 8,000
customers now signed up despite "almost no promotional support." 
Most new customers over the last few months have surfaced because
of favorable reports about the initial technical trial that began
last year, she said.

     U S WEST is not ready to announce any new trial locations, she

price sensitivity and whether service usage is seasonal.

Disney-CapCities Merger Plans Clear Department of Justice Hurdle

     The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., have
surmounted a major hurdle to Disney's proposed acquisition of
CapCities (CTR, Aug. 11, 1995).  The Justice Department's Antitrust
Division has approved the merger proposal following Disney's
announcement that it will sell KCAL-TV, its Los Angeles television
station.  Disney is a partner in the Americast joint video
programming venture with Ameritech Corp., BellSouth Corp., SBC
Communications, Inc., and GTE Corp.  Some industry observers expect
the FCC to rule on the transfer of TV licenses related to the
proposed CapCities deal at a tentatively scheduled Jan. 31 meeting.

     The expected sale of KCAL-TV "resolves any potential antitrust
concerns that could arise from Disney's acquisition of KABC-TV, a
Los Angeles television station currently owned by Capital
Cities/ABC," Justice said.  

     The Antitrust Division had been investigating whether Disney's
ownership of both KCAL-TV and KABC-TV might lead to reduced
competition and higher TV advertising rates in Los Angeles.  Before
that investigation concluded, however, Disney notified Justice that
it planned to sell KCAL-TV.  It also pledged to maintain KCAL-TV
and KABC-TV as "separate, competing stations until the sale is
completed," Justice said.

     To help ensure that the sale of the station occurs and to
protect KCAL-TV competitors before the sale, Disney agreed to sign
a consent decree requiring the appointment of a trustee to carry
out the sale.  

     The decree will be filed in court only if Disney (1) fails to
enter into a definitive agreement within nine months to sell
KCAL-TV, (2) fails to complete the sale of KCAL-TV in 12 months,
and (3) seeks FCC authority to own both KCAL-TV and KABC-TV
permanently.

     Disney originally had sought a temporary waiver of FCC rules
that prevent broadcasters from owning two VHF stations in a single
market, saying that enactment of the pending telecommunications
legislation might render such ownership of broadcast stations
legal.  Disney now wants the Commission to approve the temporary
waiver request so it can operate both stations until the planned
divestiture of KCAL-TV is complete, a Disney spokesman said.

     Justice also examined "all potential competitive effects"
stemming from the planned CapCities transaction, including the
effect of combining the video production and distribution
businesses of Disney and CapCities, the department said.  

     It concluded that "such a combination would not violate the
antitrust laws."  Earlier this month Disney and CapCities
shareholders overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition of
CapCities (CTR, Jan. 12).

SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TELEPHONE CUTS MULTIMEDIA DIVISION

     Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. (SNET) has
confirmed that it will whittle from 75 to 28 the number of
employees in its Multimedia Division as it continues to merge the
remainder of the staff into its expanding publishing operations. 
A SNET spokeswoman said the company had "overstaffed" its
multimedia group because of early industry predictions that a
digital video standard would exist by mid-1995.  Because of the
current lack of a standard and uncertainty over when one will
exist, she said, SNET has determined that "it's premature to be
working on digital at this time. . .We could roll out digital
technology tomorrow, but it likely would be throwaway technology."

     Most of the displaced 47 workers will be transferred to other
areas of the company, she said, but some may be let go
indefinitely.  She was quick to stress that the multimedia staff
cuts are not a signal that SNET is backing away from digital video
technology.  The staff reduction, she said, is attributable
partially to synergies realized after the division was merged with
the publishing unit, requiring fewer people to do the work.  The
SNET publishing unit, which traditionally has overseen the
company's printed directories, has expanded into online ventures in
recent months, increasing its relevance to multimedia.

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES

     The cable TV industry is facing "aggressive competition" as
new digital technologies allow companies to enter traditional cable
TV markets, according to a report by the Multimedia Research Group. 


     MRG says "quadrature amplitude modulation" (QAM) and
"quadrature phase shift key" (QPSK) technologies, along with the
development of Motion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) standards, have
allowed direct broadcast satellite and multichannel multipoint
distribution service providers to achieve "stunning success,"
resulting in "unexpected new opportunities."

DirecTV BEEFS UP SATELLITE NETWORKS

     DirecTV, Inc., has announced an agreement with PrimeTime 24,
its a la carte network feed service, to add the NBC station in Los
Angeles, San Francisco's CBS affiliate, and the ABC station in
Seattle.  PrimeTime 24's offerings now include the ABC and NBC
affiliates in New York City; the CBS affiliate in Raleigh, N.C.;
the Fox station in Chicago; and the PBS network in Denver.  The
expanded service became available on Jan. 17 for $4.95 per month. 


     The cable TV industry has criticized direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) service in the past because it does not carry local
broadcast networks.  PrimeTime 24 President Chuck Griege said the
addition of the West Coast affiliates will increase viewing
flexibility by allowing subscribers to "take advantage of time zone
differences."  Meanwhile, DirecTV also announced that it has
authorized Matsushita Electric Corp. to manufacture DBS receivers
through its Panasonic brand, but the terms were not disclosed. 
DirecTV is a division of Hughes Electronics Corp.

ATM TECHNOLOGY:  A CLOSER LOOK

     Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) refers to a switching and
transport technology developed to transmit digital voice, video,
and data traffic simultaneously and in either direction, offering
both high speed and cost-effectiveness.  

     ATM transfer is based on moving information units, called
cells.  Digital information enters a broadband system as packets,
which are much larger than cells.  The ATM switch takes all the
incoming packets, mixes them up and cuts them into cells.  It then
sends the cells down the fiber cable in a configuration and at a
bandwidth picked to gain the most efficient transmission.  The
ATM-determined path is known as a virtual channel.

     At the destination, another ATM switch takes the cells and
recreates the original packets of voice, video, or data
information.  The packets then leave the ATM switch and travel down
fiber and coaxial cables to their destination:  a specific home
computer, television, or telephone.

     When ATM-protocol communications enter an MPEG-II broadband
cable network, they are converted out of ATM format and the ATM
signals are mapped onto MPEG.  On an all-ATM system such as Time
Warner's Orlando FSN, ATM transmissions are decoded and routed to
their final TV, computer, or telephone by a set-top box.

TCI, CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT

     Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) and Continental Cablevision,
Inc., have announced a definitive agreement to trade assets
covering about 200,000 subscribers in Massachusetts, Missouri, and
Illinois.  Continental will take over TCI systems serving about
100,000 customers in areas surrounding Andover, Cape Cod, Waltham,
and Nantucket, Mass.  TCI in turn will gain Continental's
operations in several St. Louis suburbs and systems in Belleville
and Scott Air Force Base, Ill.  The deal further clusters TCI's
operations in St. Louis, where it already covers the metropolitan
area.

     William Schleyer, Continental's President and Chief Executive
Officer, said the addition of the Massachusetts systems will help
the company cluster more operations in the Northeast, where its
largest customer base is located.  The terms of the agreement were
not disclosed.

INTERCONNECTION DEAL

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., and Pacific Bell have
reached an interconnection agreement allowing Teleport to begin
offering switched local exchange service in California.

     Teleport, a competitive access provider, is owned by
Tele-Communications, Inc., Continental Cablevision, Inc., Cox
Enterprises, and Comcast Corp.  The pact is the first Pacific Bell
has reached with a competitor since the California Public Utilities
Commission released interconnection guidelines last month.

     Although the agreement on technical interconnection
arrangements will allow local exchange competition to begin, it
does not resolve every issue that is a "prerequisite to real,
effective local exchange competition," including unbundling and
database-driven number portability, said Michael Morris, Teleport
Regional Director-regulatory and external affairs.

KENTUCKY COURT UPHOLDS DENIAL OF CABLE FRANCHISE RENEWAL 

     The U.S. District Court of Owensboro, Ky., has issued an order
that may become the first test of franchise renewal protections for
cable TV operators as outlined in the 1984 Cable Act.  Provisions
of that law, many of which withstood modifications in the 1992
Cable Act, made it very difficult for cities to deny franchise
renewal requests.

     The court upheld the refusal of the city of Sturgis, Ky., to
renew the local franchise of Union CATV, Inc., a 2,500-subscriber
cable TV company with two systems--in Morganfield and Sturgis.  In
Sturgis, where the company has about 700 customers, the parties
could not agree on the city's "future cable-related community needs
and interests," the court said.

     Union CATV President Alan Reed said he plans to appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati as soon as the lower court
decides whether to grant a stay, which would allow the company to
continue operations pending the outcome of the appeal.  "We're
looking for a quick turnaround here," he said.  The Kentucky Cable
TV Association may file an amicus brief in the case, a spokeswoman
said.

CBS PONDERS CABLE NEWS 

     CBS, Inc., is toying with starting a cable news network, a CBS
spokesman has confirmed.  Reports surfaced earlier this month that
the historically cable-phobic company might start a news channel
after Michael Jordan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Westinghouse Electric Co., signaled interest during an interview on
NBC, Inc.'s cable channel, CNBC.  

     Westinghouse announced it would purchase CBS for $5.3 billion
in August 1995.  Peter Lund, President of CBS Broadcast Group,
recently expressed interest in cable TV services (CTR, Oct. 6,
1995, p. 13) but has not been specific about possible content.

ALL IS NOT CALM AT ALLCOMM:
ITS USE OF "CELLULAR ONE" STIRS UP A LEGAL TUSSLE

    When Pactel Mobile Access purchased the non-wireline system in Atlanta,
Ga., from Gencell and opted not to use the "Cellular One" trade name, as it has
in other non-wireline markets, the result was that no one was using the
Cellular One trademark in Atlanta.
    Enter Allcomm Telecommunications Inc., a cellular reseller in Atlanta.
Beginning last September, the name "Cellular One Atlanta" made its appearance
in the Atlanta phone book.  Call the number, however, and you'll find yourself
talking to a customer service rep from Allcomm.  "We have filed (in Georgia) as
'Cellular One Atlanta Corp., doing business as Cellular One,'" Allcomm
president Peter Bright told CS&M.  Why?  "Two reasons," Bright said.  "First,
we are providing a public service to help roamers.  We had a perfect example
today.  A Cellular One customer roaming here from Cincinnati broke his antenna.
He found the name Cellular One [in the phone book], called us, and we fixed
it."
    Second, "the name Cellular One has never been used in Atlanta and probably
never will be used.  Pactel spent multimillion dollars to promote its own
name."
    But aren't you concerned that the owners of the Cellular One trademark
might object?  "They only charge $1 a year [for a non-wireline company] to use
the name.  So we're not robbing them.  We're ready to pay our dollar, but they
won't take it.  We'll sign any document they want to provide us.  [One of their
lawyers] said we couldn't use it 'because you're a reseller and we only license
the name to carriers.'
    "Our argument is that we're a provider of cellular service.  We have a full
sales and service force that can help customers, so we decided to go ahead and
use the name....We get calls [from our phone-book listing] all the time such
as, 'I'm trying to reach a Cellular One customer roaming in Atlanta; how do I
do it?' or 'I'm roaming in Atlanta; how do I access the system?' or 'I'm having
equipment trouble; can you help me?'"
    Allcomm is the company's official name.  The name Cellular One appears only
in the phone book, not in any of the company's public advertising, its
letterheads, calling cards, etc.  "When someone calls," Bright explained, "our
reps immediately explain that, 'No, we are not Cellular One.  We're Allcomm
Telecommunications, a reseller for the non-wireline in Atlanta.  We provide
sales and service.  Can we be of assistance to you?'"
    When asked about Allcomm's use of the trademark, Southwestern Bell Mobile
Systems (which was apparently unaware of the usage) replied, in an official
statement issued through director of marketing communications Walter Patterson:
"The Cellular One logo is the service mark of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems,
and it is protected by trademark laws.  It is a violation to willingly use the
mark without the proper authorization from SBMS.  If anyone attempts to use it
without authorization, we will exercise our legal rights to prevent them from
doing so, and we have a responsibility to the companies or individuals who are
using the service mark properly.  Hand in hand with that is our responsibility
to existing and potential customers.  They should be able to feel confident
that when they call Cellular One, they are indeed dealing with Cellular One,
and not with someone else."  Patterson also added that "we haven't received a
written request from Allcomm to use the logo."  Meanwhile, Bright explained
that the earlier request had been oral; a written request is now being
prepared.  (Allcomm Telecommunications Inc., 11230 Hwy. 9, Suite 110, Roswell,
GA 30076, 404/343-9237; Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems Inc., 17330 Preston

"Cellular 21" is the company name, but it's not cellular as we know it

"Cellular 21" is the company name, but it's not cellular as we know it today.
Matt Edwards has received an experimental license from the FCC to experiment
with the new CT-2 ("CT" means "cordless telephone") technology, which is making
such a splash in Europe.  CT-2 is "single-channel, duplex, spectrum-efficient,
with frequencies that can be reused every half mile--or less," Edwards said.
He believes that CT-2 "will take away the whole low end of the cellular
business before it starts," he told us during a recent interview.  Why?
Edwards pointed out that, according to the Wall Street Journal, 70% of the
households in the U.S. have no discretionary income.  The remaining 30% have an
average of $1000 per month for discretionary income.  These figures mean that
of the nation's 78 million households, the potential cellular market is "no
more than 10 million households.  We're betting that...cellular will peak out
at 8 to 9 million....We think [CT-2] is the answer to cellular in the 21st
Century....[The new technology] is the only way of supporting a large number of
users."  (Cellular 21 Inc., 301 Route 17N, Rutherford, NJ 07070, 800/662-4520

TIME FOR A NEW ABBREVIATION:  "SRP"--"SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE"

    We are coining a NEW ABBREVIATION, which our industry has needed for a
long time.  The abbreviation is "SRP," which means "suggested retail price."
Of course, we all know a phone with an SRP of $599 will, because of carrier
bounties, sell for $399--or even less.  No manufacturer today expects any
carrier or retailer to actually sell a phone anywhere near its SRP.  The SRP
does, however, present a starting point for comparison purposes.

CES REPORT:  IS CELLULAR FINALLY GOING RETAIL?
RETAILERS, MANUFACTURERS THINK SO.

    The cellular industry as a whole may not be ready for it, and penetration
rates are a long way from showing it, but cellular is rapidly becoming a retail
product--so rapidly that the vast majority of sales (even though they may not
be "good" sales, meaning that they may be low-revenue generators for the
carriers) may soon be made at the retail level.
    That opinion, in one form or another--primarily in the way the
manufacturers are packaging, pricing and promoting their new lines and the way
that high-volume, discount electronic firms are getting into cellular--seemed
to show up everywhere we looked at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
in Las Vegas.
    So great was cellular's influence at CES that this show (and its summer
equivalent in Chicago) is the one that is seeing the introduction of more new
cellular products than any other show.  Could it be that cellular is finally
penetrating through to the consumer market?
    As Mark Ripley, VP-network for GTE Cellular Communications, put it in the
session entitled, "Cellular:  Not Just Another Cordless Phone":  "Cellular is
altering the way people think about communications.  Most people who use
cellular become addicted to it."
    Despite the addiction potential, the sale of cellular can be a tough one.
Al Brotsky, president of Al & Ed's Autosound of Monterey Park, Calif., put it
this way at the same session:  "If you were to ask me to choose the most
complex product to sell at retail and still make a profit, it would be
cellular, hands down."  He stressed the importance of educating the retail
salesperson.  "Only 10% of your competition has studied the latest benefits and
features of cellular," he said.  "The more you know, the more you sell for
more."
    Indeed, we are seeing the "birth of an industry," telecommunications
analyst and market researcher Herschel Shosteck of Silver Spring, Md.,
explained during a presentation at the Mobile Electronics Retailing and
Installation session during the convention.  He noted that even though cellular
has barely penetrated 17% of the business market, he predicted that the total
cellular users in 1995 should reach 12-22 million, an upward revision of his
earlier prediction of 12-20 million.  Particularly significant today, he said,
is the increased percentage of purchases that are replacement units (8%) and
add-ons (or second unit, e.g., purchase of a second phone for the spouse)
(27%).  He also noted that 48% of all portables are purchased by individuals
who already own cellular phones, which means that salespeople should go after
their existing cellular customers and attempt to step them up to a portable.
"The portable market is expanding explosively," he said.

NEC America Inc., 383 Omni Dr., Richardson, TX 75080, 214/907-4000 or 800/421-
2141, introduced its new portable, the NEC P300.  It lent several models to
press and other influential attendees to try out during the convention.
Weighing in at just 14 oz., the phone is the second-smallest model on the
market and is, in fact, slightly thinner though longer than the Motorola Micro
TAC (see lead story, CSM, May 1989).  A unique feature is the built-in flip-up
1/4-wave unity-gain antenna.  Also included with the phone is a screw-in 1/4-
wave, 1.2 dB gain, rubber duck antenna for use in fringe areas.  The phone
contains 99 alphanumeric memory locations, 2- or 3-touch dial-from-memory,
automatic storage of dialed numbers, a slightly recessed power button to
prevent unintentional activation and VOX operation.  It also contains a clock
with a built-in alarm that will turn the phone on at a predetermined time--a
useful feature if you are expecting a call at a specific time but don't want to
leave the phone turned on, draining the batteries, while waiting.  Marketing
director Bruce McClelland told us the phone can survive a 2-meter drop test.
"If Braun was to build a cellular phone, it would look like this," he said.
The phone offers 80 minutes of talk time or 18 hours of standby.  Also, you can
answer a ringing phone by touching any key (except the power key); no need to
scramble for the SEND key.  Options include an external antenna and cigarette
lighter kit, as well as a handsfree kit and a booster kit for the car, plus a 1
1/2 hour rapid charger.  SRP $1799.

"This model is as close to the feel of a regular telephone in the ear piece as
we could make it," NovAtel Carcom VP-general manager Ira Tabankin said.  Also,
the model has no ridges between the keys and has an improved ringer.  Look for
NovAtel to introduce the PTR 825 portable in July.  It will be about 2/3 the
weight of the 800/800A, have 120 memory locations, a dot-matrix display and be
shirt-pocket size, Tabankin said.  (NovAtel Carcom Inc., 3800 Sandshell Dr.,

Sanyo Fisher USA Corp., 21350 Lassen St., Chatsworth, CA 91311, 818/998-7322,
showed a working model of its CMP 310 cellular portable, which it had
previously shown only as a dummy (see CES report, CSM, July 1989).  "We're
testing sales of the unit in Canada," national product manager for mobile,
audio and electronics Steve Valentine told us.  "It's doing very well.  We will
decide shortly on whether we should bring it into the U.S. and at what price
point....We're studying the market very carefully....We do it right, or we
don't do it....We don't serve any wine before its time!"  The CMP 310 has 99
memory-dial locations, 45 minutes of talk time AND 8 hours of standby, auto-
redial at 2-minute intervals, and an optional car-lighter adapter and handsfree
kit for use in the car.

RBMI Inc., 16022 Arminta St., Suite 12, Van Nuys, CA 91406, 818/786-2018, is
working with a major cellular carrier to develop a solar-powered cellular
package.  "The idea is to develop a folded solar cell that you can carry in an
attache case, which would recharge nicad batteries," RMBI president Rami Ben
Moshe told us.  "You won't have to carry a heavy power pack.  This would be
very light weight.  I believe [this concept] will be a real revolution in the
cellular industry."  RBMI is "the leading firm in the country with consumer
solar products," Moshe said.

introduced multiple system registration in the software--not in the NAM--in all
of its models.  "You can register your phones in as many systems as you want,"
John Sunderland explained.  The feature is programmable from the handset.  The
user stores each phone number in a memory location as if it were a phone
number, including the SID (system ID number) and area code.  Also, the phones
come with 7-digit activation already built in, right from the factory, to make
selling the phones easier for retailers. "We provide the codes to the
carriers," Sunderland said.  "The phones cannot be unlocked until the sale is
approved.  They're secure on the shelf."

C.M. Telecom, 14675 Titus St., Panorama City, CA 91402, 818/780--0380,

C.M. Telecom, 14675 Titus St., Panorama City, CA 91402, 818/780--0380, showed
"3 boxes, 2 phones," director of sales-eastern region Dino Vakoutis explained.
The 2 phones are AR3800M mobile and the AR3800T transportable (weight 4.8 lb.),
both of which are handsfree.  The 3 boxes contain:  (1) transceiver and
handset, (2) transportable kit, and (3) handsfree car kit.  Look for delivery
of mobiles in February and transportables in March, Vakoutis said.  The phones
have 3, 1.5 and 0.6 user-selected power settings, signal- and battery-strength
indicators, dual NAM and alphanumeric memory dial with 99 memories.  The phones
offer an autodial function, which can be turned on or off, that automatically
sends the call a few seconds after it is recalled from memory.  A new feature:
to answer an incoming call, you simply touch any of the top 12 keys on the pad.
The phone also offers one feature that helps reduce churn for the carrier.
"When you program the phone, you put a code in that prohibits the phone from
being reprogrammed unless the customer has the code.  The customer first has to
call the carrier to get the code," he said.  "This gives the carrier one last
shot at keeping the customer."  The target market:  "We are going after
carriers and distributors in a market" and offering them exclusive distribution
agreements.  The phones are also being offered for private labeling, "even on
smaller orders."  Dealer price is in the"mid-$400s" for the car phone and the
"low $600s" on the transportable.

Technophone Corp. (NEW ADDRESS:  1801 Penn St., Suite 3, Melbourne, FL

Technophone Corp. (NEW ADDRESS:  1801 Penn St., Suite 3, Melbourne, FL 32901,
407/952-2100) is expected to introduce a new transportable, the model TC905A,
which will be available 'in about 6 months," marketing director Sandy Queen
told us.  It will be identical to the ME905 mobile.  The transportable kit is
retrofitable to the ME905, also.  Because the ESN is in the handset, you can
use the same handset with more than one phone.  The transportable weighs 6
lbs., has 1 hour of talk time or 8 hours of standby, and has a SRP of $799.
Technophone's mobile line is made in Hong Kong.
    Also new at the show:  the MC915A, which has a completely different styling
from the TC905 to make it more appealing to a retail market.  "It's a basic
model," Queen said.  It has a 30-number memory dial, ESN in the handset, and
works car-to-car with the cigarette lighter plug or can be converted into a
transportable by adding a battery.  "We're hoping that users will buy a
transceiver and a bag and use the handset from the car," Queen said.
Suggested retail:  $699.
    Technophone also introduced a new program for dealers and sales people,
Technopoints '90.  Every phone sold earns the salesperson or dealer a certain
number of points.  The points can then be traded for a variety of prizes out of
a glossy catalog.

by swapping boards.  It has a numeric signal strength indicator, 100-number
memory dial, a single NAM, SRP $699.

retails for $24.95.  "For mobile use, be sure to bring a long cord," company
veep Charles Beyda said.  The play-on-words possibilities are endless.  "For
communications on the go," "for that long mile" or "for the sole-filled
conversations in your life" are just a few.  But we'd better stop before we put
our foot in our mouth (which might be an improvement).

One of the most exciting products for the portable/mobile office that we saw at
the show was the new plain paper MFAX portable fax machine from U.S. Marketing
International Inc., 7405 Caminito Rialto, La Jolla, CA 92037, 619/551-8834.
The fax uses standard, perforated computer paper, or it can also use standard
typewriter or photocopy machine paper.  It weighs a mere 3.5 lbs. and works
either on 4 "C" batteries or any 6V plug-in adapter.  It is full group 3
compatible, working at 9600 baud (25 seconds per page).  It works with either
an acoustic coupler or a direct RJ11 jack to a desk or cellular telephone.
"The businessperson can now travel with their own fax machine in the briefcase
and no longer have to pay the ridiculous cost that hotels charge you to receive
faxes," explained Arnold Fisher, president and CEO of U.S.M.I.  "I paid $54 at
my hotel to receive 13 pages of copy!" he said.  The fax machine uses an H-P
jet ink printer and cartridge and produces faxes that are equal to or even
better than the quality available from standard desk machines.  It can also be
used as a printer for your laptop, a copy machine or a scanner.  SRP, $599.

PowerTek Industries introduced the Portable Cellular Workstation, which works
with "most name-brand laptop computers," said Chris Nicolaidis, national
market development manager for PowerTek.  It transmits data or voice over
cellular.  "It's a fully contained system," he said.  It includes an
error-correcting modem (the exact model varies).  The station can work on AC,
cigarette lighter plug or internal battery.  The battery permits 25 minutes to
3 hours of transmission time for data.  Weight:  17-22 lb., depending on the
weight of the computer.  It's available now at an SRP of $2595, not including
the computer.

A complete package of low-tech products assembled in one gift box and called
"The Mobile Office" was the offering of S. Hochman, 320 Frontier Way,
Templeton, CA 93465, 800/852-5888 or 805/434-3400.  The complete package
contains Hochman's new Notes on the Go, a suction-cup mounted pad holder that
sticks to the car windshield, complete with a built-in flashlight to illuminate
the pad at night.  The box also contains Numbers to Go (a flip-down address
book; see CSM, April 1989, for details), a U.S. roaming directory, a penlight
flashlight, a first-aid kit, a Rand McNally state and city pocket atlas, a
tire-pressure gauge.  The complete kit retails for $49.95.  "The man in the
house is probably the hardest person in the world to buy for at Christmas or
Father's Day," company president Sandy Hochman said.  "He generally gets a
shirt, socks, yet he may spend 2-3 hours a day in the car.  So why not give him
something that's useful?  And, of course," he added, to avoid appearing to be
chauvinistic, "this also applies to the wife!  We have more and more men and
women using their cars as an office."  [A tip:  If you're having trouble
getting your Notes on the Go (or other windshield-mounted note pad) to stick on
the window, clean the window first with rubbing alcohol, not Windex; "It leaves
a residue," he said.]  "I don't think cellular carriers are grasping the value
of cellular as much as the retailers," Kochman said.  "Carriers seem to think
that every [relatively inexpensive item, such as Notes on the Go] has to be
given away as a premium.  The retailer offers these 'premiums' as accessories
for the cellular buyer and turns them into a profit center.  The way prices of
phones are coming down, the cellular stores are going to have to look for other
profit centers.  They've got a captive audience.

Cue Paging Corp., 2737 Campus Dr., Irvine, CA 92715, 714/752-9200, showed a new
mobile mount for its nationwide pager.  The mount (SRP $129, or $9.95/month
rental) is coupled with a 1/4 wave roof-mount or magnet-mount antenna--or even
the car/truck's FM antenna--and boosts the range of reception for the pager by
25%.  The effect of the boosted range is that a vehicle can travel from, say,
Boston to Miami or Detroit to Brownsville, Tex., and always be in range of the
Cue network, John Canady, director of affiliate relations, told us.  He also
said that Cue is in the process of expanding its network to Canada.

BELL ATLANTIC BEGINS FULL-SCALE TV CAMPAIGN; AIMS AT RETAIL

    The retail cellular market may finally be here.  "The time is right,"
explained Melanie vanderValk, director of advertising and corporate
communications for Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems.  "I saw our December sales
figures.  Retail sales [during the Christmas season] were significantly more
than we had been projecting....Retail is a big part of our distribution now."
    This new, intense interest in and sales response at the retail level has
led Bell Atlantic to develop a new TV ad campaign aimed specifically at
attracting both the business and retail customers.  The campaign will appear in
2 flights, the first running through April, and the second beginning in the
summer.
    "Our customer profile is shifting from 100% business to more consumer
applications," vanderValk said.  "A lot of people are starting to justify
cellular from a safety and convenience point of view."  Consumer resistance to
the product is beginning to fade, she said, because the message is finally
getting through that cellular is no longer an unaffordable technology.
    Why TV?  "Two reasons," she said.  "First, it's more economical now to use
TV than it was in the past.  We have a broader target market to reach because
cellular is now affordable to the mass market.  Second, TV advertising is very
compelling."
    The campaign consists of two 30-second commercials that spotlight the
dependability of the Bell Atlantic cellular network and how important the phone
can be when, for example, your car breaks down 15 miles from the next exit.
The three 10-second spots      emphasize how affordable cellular is today.  One
spot compares the cost of cellular to the cost of laundering your shirts:  "For
the money you spend at the cleaners, you could be using a car phone on the Bell
Atlantic System.  And, who knows?  Maybe you could clean up."  Another compares
the cost of cellular and gasoline:  "You can use a car phone...for less [then
the cost of fuel], and put something in your car that can make you money."
    To support its retail effort, Bell Atlantic has developed a merchandising
kit for the retailers, containing banners, coverage maps and prices, tent
cards, a pocket sales guide, and so on.  The pocket sales guide, for example,
is a laminated card that slips into the salesperson's pocket and provides
instant answers to the most frequently asked questions about cellular.  "We're
also in the process of testing an interactive video guide," she said, which
would allow shoppers to get answers to commonly asked questions by accessing
an easy-to-use computer data base on display at the point of purchase.  (Bell
Atlantic Mobile Systems, 180 Washington Valley Rd., Bedmister, NJ 07921,

CELLULAND'S NETWORK-WIDE PROMO EXCEEDS SALES QUOTA BY 150%

    Working together as a network, CelluLand recently demonstrated that
combined buying power can work wonders.  Combining the purchasing clout of 23
nationwide franchisees in 9 states with special market development funds
available from Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA), and adding in the
excitement of a sales contest, CelluLand's outlets sold more than 1,000 MESA
DiamondTel phones, exceeding their combined sales quota of by more than 150%.
The theme of the campaign was, "The best things in life are free."  The
salesperson who sold the most phones during the 2-month contest received a
Caribbean cruise.  Other prizes ranged from Bahamas cruises through TVs, VCRs
and cellular phones.
    Mark Epstein, the director of special projects for CelluLand, drew on his
experience selling stereo/hi-fi equipment in the 1970s and computers in the
early 1980s when he concocted the idea for the special promotion.
    "Market development funds, which are also called key account funds, are
funds that are...used if anybody comes up with an interesting way of promoting
their product," Epstein said.  "Most manufacturers don't promote the fact that
they have these funds available, but if you go to them with a good idea, they
have the funds available.  It's a matter of knowing how to present your idea to
the manufacturer."
    Epstein convinced Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA) to expend
these market development funds in a joint promotional effort.  "I came up with
a promotion idea to try and stimulate sales of their product throughout our
franchise network," he said.  "They committed the funds subject to our
purchasing the product over a 60-day period.  We exceeded our quota by 150%.
We expected to sell 400 phones; we sold more than 1,000."  Seeing that this was
the first joint promotion, we were a bit conservative in our estimates....From
everyone's standpoint, it was a tremendous success."
    None of the advertising mentioned the price of the product.  "We positioned
ourselves not as a discount-price shop but as someone who could really deliver
quality and service at a higher price," he said.  One ad, for example, was
headlined:  "They say the best things in life are free."  The ad pictured MESA
DiamondTel portable and car phones.  The "free" benefits applied to accessories
and services, not to the price of the phone itself, and included:  Free mount
and antenna (with car phones), free carrying case (with transportables), "free
time to devote to leisure and business activities."  "Service sets us apart":
free testing and tuning, free loaner phone when necessary, free one-year
extended product warranty and free lifetime installation warranty.  (CelluLand
Inc.,  10717 Sorrento Valley Rd., San Diego, CA 92121, 619/455-1600.)

WASHINGTON (D.C.)-AREA BUSINESSES START
AN ASSOCIATION FOR CELLULAR USERS

    Cellular carriers, independent cellular carriers, cellular dealers and
cellular agents all have their own trade associations, and now so do cellular
users.  "If users are better educated and understand their phones better,
they'll be better customers," explained Jess Johnson, one of the organizers of
the National Association of Cellular Users (NACU).
    "The new association is not in competition with existing associations such
as CTIA, Telocator or USICTA," co-founder Mike Manning told CS&M.  Johnson and
Manning are partners in the Vienna, Va.,-based company Marketing International.
The third co-founder is David Shira, president of Cellular Savers Group Inc.,
also of Vienna, Va.  "Just like them, we want to expand the cellular industry,"
Manning said.  "The association is intended to provide services directly to
users of cellular service.  We're hoping to get people to use the system more
and get others to get on board and start using cellular."
    The founders are in the process of incorporating the association, adopting
its by-laws and forming its board of directors.
    The association will also express its point of view on legislative and
regulatory issues such as calling-party pays and the registration (or even
outright prohibition of ownership, as has been proposed for teenagers and
pagers) of cellphones.
    Vendors, carriers, agents and manufacturers are also invited to join as
associate members.  "We want them to feel at home with us," Johnson said.  "We
are now talking with industry leaders to form a standards and good practices
committee to promote a better climate for the continued growth of the cellular
industry," the group said in its first official statement.  "If you are
interested in contributing your expertise or would like to learn more about the
association's charter, services and membership costs, call 1-800-736-4720."

KDD Gets Direct Access to Hongkong Telecom


   KDD <9431> is utilizing Internet KDD, its international
gateway service for the Internet, to create direct lines to
Hongkong Telecom CLS, and has already started the service.  In
service trials, which began in April 1995 and will continue
until April 1996, KDD has set up direct lines with America's MCI
as well as Singapore Telecom.  The new alliance with Hongkong
Telecom CLS is KDD's third gateway.

1994 Orders of Electric Communication Devices


   According to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, which has compiled data on orders and shipments of
electric communication devices by 38 major domestic makers in
1994, the aggregate total came to 2.6 trillion yen, up 2.7% from
the previous year.  A breakdown by product category reveals that
wired communication equipment dropped 1.6%.  However, wireless
communication devices jumped 14.0%, particularly because of a
38.6% surge in orders and shipments of mobile communication
devices.  Demand by the private sector grew 5.1%.  Exports
declined 10.9%.

THIS WEEK... FCC ON HOLD

     After 2 weeks of being closed down, FCC's backlog of paperwork
is mounting and Jan. 18 agenda meeting may have to be rescheduled. 
Although talks between Administration and Congress were expected to
continue over weekend, there was no indication when govt. shutdown
would end.  Meanwhile, numerous FCC filing deadlines have come and
gone, applications have been held up and stacks of paperwork are
languishing on conference rooms at law firms throughout city.  Once
FCC gets back to work, it undoubtedly will be hit with avalanche of
requests for rescheduled deadlines in dozens of proceedings.

     FCC's Block C PCS auction, which was declared exempt from
furloughs, received high bids totaling $1.2 billion before
recessing Dec. 21 for Christmas holiday.  Auction, which will
resume Jan. 5, started Dec. 18, day shutdown began.  Specialized
Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued during first week of
shutdown, then recessed until Jan. 2.  FCC officials said SMR
auction was slowing down and Commission may move to Stage 2 bidding
rules after holiday break.

     Things have been quiet up on Capitol Hill too.  Legislators
went home for holiday without settling budget impasse or completing
action on telecom reform bill.  Although conferees week ago were
ballyhooing agreement on telecom legislation, disagreement among
House Republicans stalled final action and Congress adjourned for
holiday without filing conference report.

BIDDING IN FCC'S 2ND PCS AUCTION AT TWICE PACE OF FIRST ROUND YEAR
AGO

     Long-delayed Block C PCS auction set fast pace with 293
companies seeking 493 licenses through first 4 rounds, easily
eclipsing pace for first round in 1994 when bigger, richer
companies sought 99 licenses.  Auction recessed Dec. 21 for
holidays after Round 4 ended with $1,209,613,496 in net revenue vs.
$678.9 million through same stage in earlier auction.  Although
licenses cover same territory, industry observers suggested smaller
service areas in Block C coupled with repeated delays in launching
sales may be contributing to faster pace.  "There is a lot of
pent-up demand for these licenses," said Kathleen Ham, chief, FCC
Auctions Div.  Auction resumes Jan. 5. (Fri.)

     Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction for 1,040 licenses,
more commercial and less glitzy industry, slowed "to a crawl" and
FCC may move to Stage 2 bidding rules after holiday break, Ham told
us.  SMR bidding through 13 rounds ended with $166.9 million in net
revenue from high bids, although Atlanta Trunking's erroneous bid
of $125 million skewed numbers.  Without withdrawal of payment owed
by Atlanta Trunking, net revenue is $60.6 million, FCC said.  Ham
said Stage 2 rules require companies to bid on 75% of eligible
pops, compared with 50% in Stage 1, or face reduction in
eligibility.  Auction staff will review bidding pace after sale
resumes Jan. 2, she said.

     Interest in PCS Block C licenses grew as legal delays pushed
back start from April to summer, then fall and finally to Dec.,
with further one-week delay during first govt. shutdown.  Ham said
pent-up demand combined with 2-week hiatus for holiday probably
contributed to aggressive bidding.  Wireless Bureau Chief Michele
Farquhar said:  "This shows that good things come in small
packages."  Ham said experience acquired in first action also may
contribute to speed of bidding in current sale.

     Block C licenses could generate greater value based on smaller
territories compared with A and B Block licenses, which raised $7
billion from 18 bidders.  Ham said speculation has focused on
revenue possibilities that would increase for smaller licenses. 
Larger A and B territories, such as N.Y. and L.A., covered more
than one state, requiring substantial buildout.  Block C is geared
to Basic Trading Areas (BTAs), with 10 BTA licenses for each MTA.

     Industry analyst Herschel Shosteck offered additional reason
for size of opening round:  Block C companies are vehicles for big
companies to expand existing cellular or PCS holdings, using
ability to hold up to 49% of Block C bidder as minority partner. 
"This is a facade for the big boys to take another crack at it," he
told us.  "It all has to do with ideology."  For example, he said
U.S. AirWaves, headed by former U S West executive John DeFeo, has
backing from MCI, which has loaned company $25 million.  Wireless
entrepreneur Craig McCaw acquired 25% of Personal-Connect
Communications of Seattle.

     To qualify, companies had to have revenues under $125 million
for last 2 years, and assets below $500 million, but Shosteck said
several companies had up-front payments -- in cash -- of more than
$50 million.  AirWaves paid $81 million and NextWave, which is
thought to have Qualcomm as backer, $79 million.  At end of
auction, he said, small companies that bid "will sell out" to
larger companies, leading to news stories on success of
entrepreneurs.

     Analysis of Round 4 bids showed PCS 2000, P.R.-based company,
still would pay premium for its licenses of $11.24 per pop compared
with other leaders bidders' $7.50-$9.  Company also bid $46.5
million ($11.24) in Boston and $46.3 million ($11.24) in
Washington, D.C.  For example, GWI PCS offered $112.5 million for
L.A. ($7.73 per pop) and $48.9 million for San Francisco ($7.59),
DCR PCS offered $70.3 million, $8.58.  NextWave bid $53.1 million,
$9, in Philadelphia, and $37.8 million, $8.03, in Detroit.  In
Block A & B auction, Pacific Telesis bid high of $21.39 in L.A. and
San Francisco, Poka Lambro $1.83 for Wash.-Mont. and Guam.  Most
paid $10-$15.

     PCS 2000 is partnership formed in P.R. as Unicom dominated 3
of 4 rounds, paying premium over competitors.  Unicom Pres. Javier
Lamoso said company was created earlier in 1995 specifically to bid
in Block C auction, raising money by selling shares in $25,000
blocks to unidentified bidders.  Company paid $50 million in
upfront payments to qualify for auction, ranking 4th behind
AirWaves, NextWave, GWI PCS.

     Lamoso wouldn't comment on bidding strategy, and said he was
surprised his per-pop total was well above competitors.  "We look
like bullies," he told us from San Juan.  "I've never felt that
way, even when I was in first grade."  Lamoso said he also worked
for Cellular Communication of P.R. and P.R. Cable Assn.

SEVERAL FCC OPERATIONS CONTINUE IN GOVT. BUDGET SHUTDOWN

     Some FCC staffers remained on job as lack of budget caused 2nd
federal govt. shutdown in 5 weeks.  Unlike last time, when only 95
Commission employees were considered "essential" and remained on
job, mostly those working on World Radio Conference, portions of
many bureaus and FCC operations remained open this time.  They
include Auctions Div. handling sales for specialized mobile radio,
Block C PCS and multipoint distribution service (MDS) licenses. 
Govt. has been shut down for more than 2 weeks and, although talks
were expected over weekend, it wasn't certain whether budget
impasse would be over in time to call workers back to their desks
this week.

     FCC working staff included employees for auctions,
International and Wireless Bureaus, litigation employees in Gen.
Counsel's Office (including Gen. Counsel William Kennard) because
of 2 court arguments scheduled in mid-Dec.  As was case during Nov.
shutdown, commissioners are permitted to work, but their personal
staffs aren't, except with special dispensation.

     Commission employees reported to work Dec. 18, were told to
leave with 3 hours' notice.  FCC hq building at 1919 M St. NW, plus
3 other M St. buildings housing Commission offices, posted shutdown
notices on front doors, plus 2-page memorandum from FCC Managing
Dir. Andrew Fishel explaining situation and spelling out employees'
rights.  He cited "sudden emergency requiring curtailment of the
agency's activities;  therefore, no advance notification [to
employees] is possible." 

     As in last shutdown, comments due during shutdown days can be
delivered first day FCC returns to work after impasse ends,
official said.  Filings associated with auctions will be accepted
in lobby of 1919 M St. and reference room at 2025 M St.;  MDS
reference room at 2033 M St. is open, but only for auction-related
business, Commission said.

TELECOM REFORM BILL WAITS FOR THIS WEEK, AT LEAST

     Congress adjourned Dec. 22 for Christmas holiday without
filing conference committee report on telecom reform legislation. 
Senate Republicans and Democrats said final arrangements had been
worked out.  House Democrats were satisfied with language, pending
final examination.  But House Republicans were split:  Commerce
Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), urged members to sign conference
report while Telecom Subcommittee Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.), called
legislators from his Houston home to urge them not to sign
conference report.  Rep. Hastert (R-Ill.), member of leadership and
Commerce Committee, said members "will have to make up their own
minds" about which side to take.

     One final factor is House leadership, Rep. Stearns (R-Fla.)
pointed out.  Despite differences between Bliley and Fields, no
bill will be closed out without leadership's approving it, Stearns
said.  At time House adjourned, several Republicans told us they
still had problems with bill.  As Rep. White (R-Wash.) said on
leaving House chamber:  "We're still working on it."  Rep. Oxley
(R-O.) and Rep. Goodlatte (R-Va.), mentioned Internet regulation as
point that should be revisited.  They told us in interviews that
there was no reason that language preventing FCC from regulating
content or prices on Internet should be removed, noting that House
had passed it by large margin.

     Final language agreed to, according to Senate staff, was
little changed from night before, when Commerce Committee Chmn.
Pressler (R-S.D.) said "framework" existed.  Negotiations resulted
in removal of language covering one-year delay in RHC joint
marketing of local and long distance services.  One new phrase was
added to clarify Justice Department's role in determining whether
RHCs should enter long distance.  It said FCC should give DoJ's
opinion "substantial weight," but "such evaluation shall not have
any preclusive effect on any Commission decision..."

     Despite uncertainty on House side, Sen. Hollings (D-S.C.),
senior Commerce Committee Democrat, said:  "There's no question in
my mind that there's agreement.  It's a good bill and it's agreed
upon.  I think ultimately you've got some political atmospheres
poisoned when the Vice President says he's for it and they [House
Republicans] say, 'We're against it.'  Maybe we can get the Vice
President to announce he opposes it."

FCC PROPOSES COMPENSATION POLICY FOR LEC-WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION

     FCC proposed compensation arrangements for LEC-wireless
interconnection at final 1995 meeting that would mandate interim
use of "bill-&-keep" as reimbursement method.  Under bill-&-keep,
each carrier terminates calls for others at no charge. 
Commissioners said bill-&-keep isn't ideal system, but speed is of
essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an economically
perfect system would be the enemy of the economic good."

     Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney told commissioners
that interconnection is becoming increasingly important "as the
infrastructure evolves into a network of networks" and agency is
concerned that current FCC policies "aren't enough."  Current rules
require "mutual compensation" but don't set more specific
requirements.  Beauty of bill-&-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Keeney said, and doesn't require setting up new billing
systems.

     At present, more calls flow from wireless to wireline, meaning
LECs may have to bear more costs under bill-&-keep, but that
situation is changing.  Wireless companies, on other hand, have
complained that LECs are charging them inflated prices for
terminating their calls.  "There's a real danger" that without FCC
action, telephone companies will be able to impede development of
PCS through high prices and delays, Comr. Ness said.

     Although it considers bill-&-keep "preferred" solution,
Commission will seek comments on other options such as setting
uniform rate, charging whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to
terminate calls, picking up one of various state solutions.  Comr.
Ness said she would be willing to listen if someone came up with
better system, "but it's got to be less regulatory and it's got to
be speedy."

     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) praised FCC
compensation proposal that it said would result in decreased fees
to wireless customers and increased competition.  CTIA said that
under current practice, wireless providers are required to pay LECs
for terminating calls that originate on mobile phones but LECs
don't pay wireless carriers for terminating their calls.  CTIA
Pres. Thomas Wheeler said that in 1994 wireless carriers paid LECs
more than $800 million to terminate their calls.  "Such a fee can
only act to impede development of wireless as a competitive local
exchange service," he said.

     Commissioners took pains to emphasize that they weren't
stepping on toes of state PUCs.  Fact that FCC has authority to set
compensation arrangements was mentioned several times -- as was
eagerness to keep states in loop.  "We have a good relationship
with the state commissions and we don't want to lose it," Chmn.
Hundt said.  "We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting
state PUCs is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate
traffic.  Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Commission tentatively concluded that information on
LEC-wireless interconnection arrangements should be made public and
will take comments on how to do that -- through tariffing, public
disclosure report or other approach.  Agency will seek comment on
whether new rules should apply to interconnection between LECs and
all commercial mobile radio services or should be limited to
arrangements between LECs and 2-way providers such as PCS, cellular
and specialized mobile radio.  Other option would limit rules to
interconnection between LECs and PCS providers.

     Personal Communications Industry Assn. (PCIA) Vp Mark Golden
called FCC action "an important step for making a right that
existed in the rulebooks happen in the marketplace."  He applauded
Commission for "doing something fast and simple" rather than
following "a long, drawn-out process in search of the perfect." 
Comcast said action "may be the single biggest step the FCC has
taken so far to promote local telephone competition."

INTERNET PATHS CHALLENGE RHCs FOR LONG DISTANCE BUSINESS

     Several months ago, Nynex quietly pulled plug on one of its
little-known experiments, VermontNet, small bulletin board service
that was started to help start reentry into information services
following crash of expensive and complex InfoLook gateway service. 
Reason for ending service, company said, was that Justice Dept.
didn't agree with how VermontNet provided Internet connectivity.

     Even as Nynex withdrew from Internet, however, Ameritech and
Pacific Telesis moved in and are providing Internet access as part
of service to business customers, without DoJ objections. 
Difference, according to officials of each company, is relationship
among RHC, customer and Internet provider.

     New England Telephone (now Nynex-New England) gradually grew
VermontNet from local bulletin board offering local electronic mail
and opportunities for electronic commerce for neighboring
communities to one providing wider Internet access, including
electronic mail and file transfer protocol (FTP) service, crude
precursor to today's World Wide Web.  Internet e-mail alone "was
enough to send it over the edge," Nynex official said.  Nynex
attorneys talked with DoJ and it became clear that providing
Internet access "was not consistent with Justice's view of the
antitrust decree," company said, noting that Justice interpreted
New England's Internet access as indirectly providing forbidden
interexchange service.  Nynex had contracted with 3rd party for
transport to Internet access, but by connecting its service to
Internet service provider, Nynex permitted customers to get service
around world, Nynex official said.  Nothing ever was put in
writing, with opinions from DoJ coming in conversations with Nynex
attorneys.

     In theory, network arrangements between telco and long
distance company are similar to those between telco and Internet. 
In each case, telco sends call to switch of another service, which
then transports it to destination out of local calling area.  But
Nynex officials said key difference wasn't in network but in
economics.  In telephony, subscribers pay telco monthly bill for
local service and pay separate bill to long-distance carrier.  With
VermontNet, subscribers paid flat fee that included Internet
charges that VermontNet paid to Internet service provider to be
hooked into Internet.  "That's where the violation is," Nynex
official said, adding that it was Nynex that recognized there might
be problem, consulted DoJ and then took down service.  Official
said that important factor to consider wasn't whether Nynex
violated MFJ but that under law local telco couldn't be Internet
service provider, which it wants to be.  Also important, he said,
is that law should be changed.

     With other RHCs, MFJ questions have been avoided by
structuring service differently.  Pacific Telesis, not Pacific
Bell, offers entire package of services on server, ranging from
hosting customer information, such as Web site, obtaining domain
name (such as pbi.com), routing customer's Internet access to local
Internet service provider, providing Web browsers such as Netscape
and mail programs such as Eudora for customer local area networks. 
One thing Pacific doesn't do is provide direct link to Internet or
select path for getting there.

     Telesis attorney Keith Epstein said that when customers
contract for Internet services, they're given choice of Internet
provider much as those signing up for regular telephone service are
given choice of long distance carrier.  Telesis calls can't leave
LATA and can provide connection only to Internet.  Epstein said: 
"It's a weird way to provide service.  It's what we need to do."

     Ameritech also entered Internet business through its Advanced
Data Services unit, which isn't part of its regulated telephone
companies.  Ameritech data unit packages range of products and
services, starting with broadband access for businesses, including
hosting of customer Internet data for Web sites, gopher servers or
newsgroups, while providing local high-speed access to Internet,
such as through frame relay or other broadband data services.  As
with Pacific, however, Ameritech stops when it reaches Internet
service provider.  Spokesman Richard Maganini said customers must
choose their own Internet carrier.  As with Pacific, Ameritech also
offers customers help in registering Internet domain names, manages
customers' network and provides single point of contact for
Internet connectivity, while giving client single bill. 
Promotional material for Ameritech's Dedicated Internet Access
Service notes that service is flexible because "Ameritech allows
you to choose your route to the Internet."  But brochure also says: 
"You [customer] will also need to choose a Long Distance Internet
Provider for global access to the Internet."

RESELLERS FIGHT NEW AT&T BILLING POLICY REMOVING ITS NAME FROM
BILLS

     Telecommunications Resellers Assn. (TRA) is meeting with AT&T
in hope of convincing it to reconsider new billing policy for
aggregators and other resellers.  AT&T, which provides end-user
billing and support service for some resellers, wants to reduce its
name identification on those bills.  For example, it would remove
its name and logo from end-user bills and delete AT&T billing,
maintenance and customer service numbers.  AT&T identification
would be replaced by name, logo and numbers of resale carrier. 
Aggregators, which tend to be smaller than many resellers, would be
hardest hit by new policy, TRA said.  They resemble buying groups,
buying AT&T service in bulk and reselling it to end users.

     TRA Gen. Counsel Charles Hunter said talks have produced "some
movement," though not enough to ease Assn.'s concerns.  He said
AT&T has indicated willingness to:  (1) Grandfather use of AT&T's
customer maintenance number for life of existing contracts.  (2)
Permit its logo to be used on joint letters to customers explaining
changes.  (3) Allow aggregators to retain blue border on bills,
indicating similarity to AT&T bills.  (4) Delay start date to June
1 from earlier in spring.

     Nonetheless, "potential for damage is still very substantial,"
Hunter said.  Selling point for resellers is identification with
AT&T, he said, then "all of a sudden, the bill looks different and
the customer doesn't hear AT&T when the phone is answered."  He
said "there is a very real fear of substantial customer attrition,"
with some resellers estimating they could lose upward of 40% of
their customer base.  In addition, AT&T policy change could lead to
additional "back office" costs for resellers that have relied
exclusively on AT&T to provide billing and customer service, Hunter
said, and there could be regulatory changes as well.  Because AT&T
action could change role of aggregators, they may have to obtain
authorization by FCC or states as resale carriers, he said: 
"Depending on which states are involved, this process can take 9 to
12 months or more, at a potential cost of more than $100,000."

     AT&T spokeswoman Karen Way said "confusion to customers" is
reason company wants to take its name off reseller bills.  Several
states, including Fla., have ordered AT&T to change practice
"because of problems with misrepresentation and slamming," she
said.  There's no way of knowing whether customer is slammed by
reseller because AT&T's name, rather than reseller's, continues to
appear on bill, Way said.  Change "brings AT&T's practices in line
with industry practices and state PUC requirements," she said.

     Two AT&T billing services are affected:  (1) Bill Manager
Service, which resellers can buy from AT&T.  Service not only
renders bills, it also provides customer service.  (2)
Multilocation billing, which was designed for use by AT&T corporate
customers that need separate bills sent to various offices. 
Resellers use service to send bills to their end-user customers.

AT&T ABANDONING LECs FOR BILLING, SENDS OWN BILLS DIRECTLY TO
CUSTOMERS

     AT&T returns to consumer billing this month when it begins
sending more than 500,000 long distance customers in Cal., Fla. and
Tex. bills for service, separate from GTE bills that now carry
IXC's charges.  AT&T targeted 3 states and GTE for launch but
eventually will direct-bill all LEC customers, giving company
access to customers, it said.  AT&T said process gives it
opportunity to notify customers of promotions and other special
benefits, while also providing updates on benefit and loyalty
credits.  "We do need to be able to communicate directly with our
customers," said Nancy Smith of AT&T Consumer Service unit.  Before
divestiture, AT&T handled billing for all services.

     Move also allows AT&T to bypass LECs that currently don't
allow IXCs or other carriers to communicate directly with customers
through billing process.  For example, new AT&T bill will include
information on alternate calling plans, True Reward credits for
participants in loyalty program, cost savings based on competing
services.  Official said bill also will give customer long distance
plan options based on calling patterns monitored by company.  For
example, cheaper rates might be available for certain kinds of
service or at certain times of day, and such information would be
reflected on new bill, carrier said.

     AT&T official said new bills being introduced in GTE territory
eventually will appear in other regions, but declined to reveal
timetable or targets for next year.  Ultimately, company plans to
provide service to most of its 80 million residential customers, as
it does for 10 million business customers, official said.  Bills
are printed in Charlotte, N.C., and official said company doesn't
have plans to erect other billing centers.

     GTE officials didn't comment on AT&T plans, which will give
GTE-AT&T customers in 3 states separate bills.  GTE provides
service in Tampa, most of Tex. and substantial portions of Southern
Cal.

     New AT&T bills are larger than many of LECs', which are 4"x7"
and printed on one side of page.  New version is 6-1/2"x10", with
wide margins where service-type information is carried.  First page
includes summary of charges, with section showing savings compared
against AT&T standard rates and points earned in loyalty program.

     LECs said they were aware of AT&T plans.  Ameritech said move
would further confuse customers already bombarded by bills and
messages from utilities, including LEC.  At Nynex, for example,
AT&T recently signed one-year contract to continue using LEC for
billing customers, Nynex spokesman Bob Varettoni said.  "It's a
competitive market.  People can do what they want to do."  He said
Nynex had attractive billing and collection service for other
carriers.  Company declined to elaborate on contract terms with
IXCs.

     Nynex also will unveil new bills this month, beginning with
500,000 customers in Buffalo and reaching all by end of first
quarter, he said.  Bills will include promotional and cost-saving
information, similar to AT&T's, but features won't be extended to
IXCs or other carriers.  He said summary page will spell out costs
clearly for local, interLATA long distance and other long distance
charges along with total for billing period:  "It will be an
attractive package" based on "lot of" customer research.

     Ameritech spokesman said company thought move would add
confusion in residential market.  "Why should they reinvent what
already exists," spokesman said.  Like Nynex, Ameritech provides
billing and collection services as "common carrier" to all
companies, for fee.

CAL. PUC ADOPTS FINAL TELECOM COMPETITION RULES, GIVES OKAY TO 31
ENTRANTS

     Cal. PUC  approved rules to open local telephone loop Jan. 1
and granted certificates to 31 companies that hope to become local
exchange carriers (LECs).  They include broad cross-section of
telecom industry and at least one electric utility.  PUC said rules
are "largely the same" as proposed regulations released in July
that set broader outline for opening markets.  Agency also adopted
3-year freeze on price caps for Pacific Bell (PB) and GTE, and
lowered productivity factor to rate of inflation because
"underlying assumptions and data" that created current 5% factor
are "obsolete."  Commission also granted some increases for 4 small
telcos.

     Companies that won certificates:  Advantage Communications,
Assoc. Group, AT&T Communications, Brooks Fiber (of Bakersfield,
Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton), Cable Plus, Century
Telecommunications, Continental Telecommunications, Electric
Lightwave, Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE-Cal., GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications, Linkatel Pacific, MCI Metro
Access Transmission Services, MFS Intelenet, NewTelco, Nextlink,
Pacific Bell, Pac-West Telecomm, TCG (of L.A., San Diego, San
Francisco), Viacom Communications, Winstar Wireless.

     New rules set terms for interconnection, interim number
portability (through remote call forwarding) and universal service,
PUC said, and keep "same level of access" for deaf and disabled
residents.  PUC said it will determine cost of remote call
forwarding in separate proceeding early next year.  All telecom
providers will have to provide 911 access, directory databases and
"warm-line service," which allows residents to access emergency
services even if phone has been disconnected for other calls. 
Rules contain provisions to protect against slamming by requiring
written confirmation of each sale, with description of services and
price breakdowns.

     In other actions, PUC:  (1) Granted rate increases to 4 small
telcos -- Calaveras (68.5%), Hornitos (379%), GTE W. Coast (30.6%),
Happy Valley (29.6% for Olinda, and 53.2% for Platina exchange) --
and approved changes in state's high-cost fund, which subsidizes
rural telephone rates.  Portion of increases for Calaveras and
Hornitos will be offset by elimination of suburban mileage charges,
PUC said, covering 80% of boost for Calaveras and 20% for Hornitos. 
Agency reduced to 0.27% from 0.5% amount companies must contribute
to high-cost fund because it has grown since last year while total
draw has decreased 44%.

     (2) Released its report to state legislature on how
competition may affect universal service and proposed that basic
service include 911 access, free customer service, directory
assistance, others.  It also proposed high-cost voucher fund to
subsidize companies in rural areas and said it would lobby
legislature to change existing law to make change possible. 
Voucher system would set credits on customer bills to make sure
they received subsidy regardless of chosen provider, PUC said, and
would base amount of subsidy on cost-rate differential with
incentives to improve efficiency.  It floated idea of competitive
bidding for subsidy and said it would decide issue by June. 
Commission proposed grant programs to hook up libraries and schools
to new telecom services through bill surcharge, taxes on sale of
telecom products, or mandated discounts.  All companies also should
meet same service quality standards, PUC said.

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home
wiring rules between telcos and cable, saying change is needed
because of convergence of industries.  Action was taken at Dec. 15
agenda meeting.  Rulemaking will deal with demarcation between
customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal leakage and
quality, technical standards, customer-premises equipment (CPE) and
division of state and federal responsibilities.  Regulation of
cable and telcos should be comparable "where appropriate," FCC
Comr. Ness said, and Commission should deregulate "where it makes
sense."  Comr. Chong said she would have preferred to move
demarcation point immediately, but went along with launching
rulemaking "since we have agreed to move swiftly."  Chmn. Hundt
said owning wiring "can be a tremendous competitive advantage" for
incumbent, and new rules could make cable CPE market as competitive
as telephone equipment market.  Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1)
What demarcation point would be appropriate, acknowledging it might
be different for single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2)
Whether telcos' broadband services should have to meet same signal
leakage and signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable
should have to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system,
as telcos have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same
regulatory distinctions between residential and nonresidential
wiring as telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to
in-home broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to
divide regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise
authorities, states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal
regulation of telephony and video programming.

     FCC Wireless Bureau rejected Radiofone request for delay in
Block C PCS auction, saying company's request for emergency relief
didn't meet test required and would hurt bidders in current
auction.  Order signed by Michele Farquhar, acting chief of Bureau,
said granting stay in fact would cause "irreparable harm to other
parties and would be inconsistent with the public interest." 
Radiofone sought stay Dec. 8 as part of challenge to Commission's
rules barring cellular license holders from seeking 30 MHz PCS
licenses in same region.  Order said Radiofone's argument that
Commission can't apply its rules to restrict ownership is
insufficient to overturn rulemaking developed last year.  "It is
very unlikely that the Commission would... reexamine the merits of
the 45 MHz spectrum cap, which was adopted a little over a year ago
to promote competition, discourage anticompetitive behavior and
create incentives for innovation and efficiency in CMRS [Commercial
Mobile Radio Service], including broadband PCS," order said.  It
also said rule wasn't at issue when 6th U.S. Appeals Court,
Cincinnati, remanded rulemaking to Commission.  Bureau said further
delay in auction, which began Dec. 18, "will cause severe harm to
each of the other C Block applicants."

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC
seeking to avoid substantial withdrawn-bid penalty in specialized
mobile radio auction (SMR) after intended $125,000 bid became $125
million error.  Company said bid filed electronically carried 3
extra zeros.  In waiver request, it asked Commission to consider
size of company and nature of mistake in granting waiver.  Full
Commission will have to review request at end of auction, lawyer
Diane Law said Thurs.  Under FCC rules, companies that withdraw
bids are liable for penalty based on difference between withdrawn
offer and eventual high bid at end of sale.  Company earlier bid
$1,100 for same license, designated P frequency block;  high bid
before error was about $100,000, submitted by FCI 900 -- which is
Nextel.  Atlanta Trunking resubmitted $125,000 bid in Round 10, FCC
said.  Efforts to contact company, part of Southland Corp. and SMR
operator at 900 MHz in Atlanta, were unsuccessful.

     Ill. Circuit Court, Chicago, dismissed Health & Environmental
Sciences Group (HES) and Dr. George Carlo as defendants in lawsuit
brought by Debbra Wright, who charged cellular telephone caused
brain cancer and who accused industry of conspiracy to conceal
evidence.  Judge Paddy McNamara said Wright case, originally filed
against Motorola, included substantial evidence, but nothing
linking HES to conspiracy.  He's expected to issue written opinion
this month and rule in March on similar charges Wright filed
against Wireless Technology Research (WTR), which also is headed by
Carlo and set up by industry to study health effects of cellular
phones.  WTR said all allegations should be dismissed because "they
are based on the same key factual issues the judge has now
resolved... WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are
wasteful attacks on the scientific community, that they slow
completion of the research necessary to answer the public's
questions about the health effects of all wireless technology and
that these tactics could themselves pose threats to public health
if they delay implementation of any interventions that may prove
necessary."

     CWA accused NBC-owned WCAU-TV Philadelphia of censorship for
declining to broadcast anti-Bell Atlantic (BA) commercials carried
by other stations.  "This is censorship, plain and simple," CWA Vp
Vincent Maisano said.  Union, locked in 5-month contract dispute
with BA, hasn't been able to place several commercials criticizing
RHC on Philadelphia station.  Latest spot features actor as "Larry"
that union said is parody of contractors hired by company to
perform work done by union-covered employees.  "Bell Atlantic runs
millions of dollars worth of advertisements on WCAU," Maisano said. 
"All we are asking for is the opportunity to pay for our own ads to
tell our side of the story."  Official said station doesn't carry
issue-oriented ads, such as CWA spots.  "It wasn't in response to
the issues that CWA raises," spokeswoman said.  Station and
ABC-owned WPVI, also Philadelphia, rejected all CWA ads focusing on
bargaining with BA, she said.  Company commercials discuss service
options and describe corporate initiatives, don't address labor
discussions.

     RHCs' share of access revenues is likely to decline to 80%

     RHCs' share of access revenues is likely to decline to 80%
from current 97% when local competition begins, putting pressure on
cash flows and causing drop in average credit ratings to A1 from
Aa3, Moody's said.  Revenue growth will slow to 1.4% annually
through 1999 compared with average 2.2% growth for 5 years through
1994, rating agency said.  "Unprecedented challenge" to residential
and business customer base will occur with or without reform
legislation, as state lawmakers and regulators seek to open
markets, said Stephen Gutkowski, vp-senior credit officer. 
Business segment will be first target of competitors, he said, with
residential competition much later.  "It will be a number of years
before any facilities-based alternative can provide a mass-marketed
switched voice service that will have a material impact on the
telephone companies' market share."  RHC revenues also will be hit
by bypass technologies and price cuts charged to IXCs, to 1.5 cents
per min. from current 3 cents, Gutkowski said.  "Moody's believes
the loss of market share in existing lines of business will have
greater impact on credit quality than the possible benefits from
entering new lines of business," he said.

     U.S. and Mexico will look into allegations by Telephone

     U.S. and Mexico will look into allegations by Telephone
Workers Union of Mexico that Sprint closed La Conexion Familiar
subsidiary in San Francisco to harm union, U.S. Dept. of Labor
(DoL) officials said.  Examination will focus on how plant closings
affect union organizing, DoL said.  However, it won't lead to any
penalties because only NLRB has jurisdiction, said Jack Otero,
deputy undersecretary for international affairs.  NLRB judge in
Aug. ruled that San Francisco unit was closed primarily because it
was losing money, although 50 job-related violations were noted. 
Sprint made shutdown decision 8 days before scheduled employee vote
on joining CWA.  Study will be conducted by Labor Secretariat,
organization of U.S., Mexican and Canadian officials set up to
review labor conditions under NAFTA.  CWA and Sprint said case was
unlikely to cause Sprint regulatory problems in Mexico.  Mexican
govt. officials had complained about closing, saying U.S. wasn't
enforcing its labor laws.

     Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom consortium acquired majority
control of privatized Hungarian telecom operator Matav for $850
million, boosting stake to 67% from 30%.  Officials said dramatic
improvement in Matav since first investment prompted increase in

Development, said:  "Additional investment will enable even more
rapid creation of value as we accelerate the application of our
operation and marketing skills."  Matav has 1.8 million lines and
penetration of 24%, with 524,050 requests for service pending. 
"Rarely do you have this kind of suppressed demand," Catlow said. 
Ameritech week ago led consortium in acquiring 49.9% of Belgacom
for $2.39 billion.

     Bell Atlantic (BA) submitted price cap plan to Md. PSC that
proposes 5 categories:  (1) "Access," covering long distance
connections.  (2) "Basic-Residential" for nonbusiness lines.  (3)
"Basic-Other" for business lines.  (4) Discretionary, covering
optional services such as call waiting and call forwarding.  (5)
Competitive, for services offered by other providers such as
Centrex and speed dialing.  BA said it will cap access and
basic-residential rates for 2 years, basic-other for one year. 
After that, it said, it would adjust services based on Gross
Domestic Product price index minus 1.5%.  Discretionary services
wouldn't rise more than 25% per year, BA said, but competitive
services would be unregulated.  It also said plan would preserve
existing quality-of-service standards.  MCI submitted its own price
cap plan for BA last month that it claimed would shave $72 million
off intrastate toll rates.  However, BA has criticized that
proposal as "rate-of-return in sheep's clothing," saying it
underestimated universal service costs by $47 million.

COMMUNICATIONS BILLING REPORT via NewsNet
February 23, 1996

FCC Clarifies Rules on Use of BNA Information

     The FCC on Feb 1. adopted a third order for reconsideration in
Common Carrier docket no. 91-115 in which it upheld a series of
earlier rulings that require local exchange carriers (LECs) to
provide billing name and address (BNA) information to
telecommunications service providers (TSPs) under tariff. The
Commission also clarified its rules regarding the use and
disclosure of BNA information.  The third reconsideration order is
the latest in a long-running docket proceeding.  

     That docket has produced numerous orders, clarifications, and
reconsiderations stemming from a 1989 petition by Capital Network
Systems, Inc., and the Competitive Telecommunications Association
asking that the FCC require LECs to provide BNA information to long
distance carriers and competitive access providers so that they
could properly bill for their services.  

     This latest order for reconsideration responds to two
petitions from U S WEST Communications, Inc., which it filed in
1993 asking the Commission to reconsider its second report and
order of that year covering the use and disclosure of BNA
information ("BNA order").  The third reconsideration order also
addresses concerns raised by other carriers, including operator
service providers.  

     U S WEST asked the Commission to reconsider again rules that
require LECs to notify customers that their billing information
will be made available to TSPs under certain conditions.  

     The order also set out a series of deadlines for notification,
which generated a series of petitions from LECs and the United
States Telephone Association asking for more time.  In subsequent
orders, the FCC extended the deadlines for those disclosures.  

     All the deadlines have now passed, and like other LECs, U S
WEST has completed its notification process but asked the FCC to
consider that the process was harmful to the carrier.  Throughout
the docket proceeding, the FCC has upheld its original conclusion
that providing BNA information for third-party, calling card, and
collect calls, is "a common carrier service which must be offered
under tariff."

     Petitions for reconsideration by U S WEST and others arguing
against this judgment were repeatedly denied.

     The FCC's third reconsideration order, released Feb. 9,  deals
with issues raised by U S WEST in two separate petitions that the
FCC reconsider its first and second orders for reconsideration.  In
its first petition, U S WEST argued that its First Amendment right
to remain silent was violated by the BNA rules and that it had been
done "irreparable harm" by Commission requirements that it notify
its customers of the status of their billing information.  

     The Commission denied that petition on the grounds that the
carrier had already made that argument in earlier proceedings. 
(The Commission found in 1986 that BNA information falls into a
category of "legal notifications" that are excepted from First
Amendment protection.)  In its second petition, U S WEST claimed
that the FCC had earlier misjudged the carrier's argument on First
Amendment grounds and that in the course of the FCC's orders for
reconsideration U S WEST had been denied due process.  The
Commission found that the carrier's rights to due process had "not
been abridged" by its earlier orders.  

     Further, the Commission ruled that privacy protections that
prohibit disclosure of BNA information on calling card,
third-party, and collect calls apply only when a customer
"affirmatively withholds consent for BNA disclosures."  In its
original BNA orders, the FCC required LECs to notify customers that
their BNA information would be disclosed to TSPs for these types of
calls.  The notification process included an option for customers
to request that such information not be disclosed.  

     The BNA orders also set out rules restricting the use of BNA
information for marketing purposes.  The prohibitions were opposed
by several carriers and operator service providers, such as Oncor,
Inc., that rely on that information for their targeted marketing
activities.  In the third order for reconsideration, the Commission
upheld its earlier finding that direct marketing activities, such
as those that might involve the use of BNA information, can be a
"nuisance" to consumers.  

     The Commission also clarified that the prohibition on usage of
BNA information is applicable to all types of calls, even though
requirements for providing BNA information on a tariff basis apply
only to third-party, calling card, and collect calls.

     Acting on additional U S WEST arguments, the Commission said
BNA information on calls that do not involve calling cards, third
parties, or collect charges could be supplied to TSPs under tariff
or contract "to the extent [that] provision. . .is not prohibited
by our rules." 

     Specifically, the Commission clarified that BNA information
may be provided to interexchange carriers in association with
"10XXX 1+" calls--those in which an alternative long distance
provider is chosen by the customer.  The use of such dialing codes
was not in evidence at the time of the original BNA order, the
commission said, but it found that calls requiring dialing codes
have similar billing requirements to calling card and other toll
calls.  Further, the Commission said LECs are not required to
notify customers of the disclosure of BNA information when dialing
codes are used.

CTIA's Cibernet Adapting to New Wireless Billing Requirements

     As wireless carriers continue to increase their calling
traffic and the diversity of their services both in the U.S. and
abroad, it is becoming increasingly necessary to devise newer,
flexible billing systems to accommodate their needs, according to
Cibernet Corp.'s Dawn M. Brodman, Manager-industry standards, and
Jennifer Nowak, Product Manager-CORD.  Cibernet is a subsidiary of
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the
standard-setting body for the U.S. wireless industry.  

     The Cibernet subsidiary grew out of the CTIA's Roamer
Committee, which was "commissioned to support network settlement
agreement standards," among wireless carriers, said Ms. Nowak.  In
the mid-1980s that group developed the CIBER (cellular information,
billing, exchange, and roaming) standard, now in use throughout
U.S. cellular networks.  Cibernet was created in 1988 to administer
the CIBER standard and to provide network settlement services to
cellular carriers.

     CIBER is based on CTIA's IS-124 standards for wireless call
data, said Ms. Brodman.  "We dynamically update our standard based
on technology requirements, among other things."  CIBER is a
batch-oriented standard, designed to aggregate information over a
set period of time.  Under the batch system, Ms. Brodman explained,
"There are time provisions [within the transmission protocol] that
automatically kick out a message that is over 30 days old.  But
there may be times when a cellular customer won't see a roaming
bill for 45 to 60 days."  

     Analysts have noted that such delays in bill reporting lead to
needless expenses for the service provider and confusion for the
customer (CBR, Nov. 17, 1995).  The proliferation of personal
communications service (PCS), advanced cellular services, and
international transmission protocols--all of which require more
flexible and responsive billing systems--has led Cibernet to
replace the CIBER standard.

     "Consider CIBER to be our legacy standard," said Ms. Brodman. 
Cibernet has formed working groups to develop two new standards,
one for billing and support functions and another for fraud
detection systems.  "The goal is to get down to a 60-second
turnaround time" between the time a roaming call is made and the
time it is recorded in the service provider's billing system, she
noted, adding, "This isn't real-time billing, but it's close.  We
expect most carriers will still retrieve their billing information
in some kind of batch form."  But, she said, carriers could
retrieve information in batch form several times a day, rather than
weekly or monthly, which is more common now.

CORD Project Aims for Paperless Management

      Another effort to streamline wireless carrier billing
interoperations is the CORD (Cibernet Online Roaming Database)
project.  CORD is an automated, shared database for the exchange
and maintenance of billing information and roaming data among
wireless carriers.  Ms. Nowak told CBR the system is due to be
released this year and that Cibernet expects it to become the
standard platform for interoperator roaming agreements.

     When wireless carriers enter into roaming agreements today,
they must record the details of the agreement on paper and
distribute them to all the parties involved for entry into
proprietary billing systems.  This leads to a lag time between the
conclusion of the agreement and its actual implementation within
the wireless networks, said Ms. Nowak.

     CORD stores the details of roaming agreements worked out
independently between carriers with adjoining cellular coverage
areas.  Parties that have formed a roaming agreement enter relevant
data (e.g., interconnection rates) jointly into the CORD system. 
Only the original carriers, or others that they jointly designate,
have access to the information.  Access is controlled by a system
of user identification profiles and verification procedures,
explained Ms. Nowak.  The carriers are then able to connect their
in-house billing platforms to CORD in order to update vendor tables
and other records used to track calling data.

     In addition, authorized carriers can make modifications to an
agreement at any time. The changes are automatically reflected in
the database and in the systems of all the parties that have access
to the agreement.  Ms. Nowak said this eliminates the need for
system operators repeatedly to "key in" the details of the roaming
agreement (at each vendor location).  

     This reduces the time to market for new services and the risk
of human error in the billing systems.  CORD's database and
communications protocols are based  on the CIBER standard for the
sharing of billing information--a standard already in use by most
the wireless carriers in the U.S. said Ms. Brodman.  When other
standards are adopted, Cibernet will change CORD to accommodate
them, she said.  

     "CORD is not commercially available yet," said Ms. Nowak.  But
she expects it to be released this year after beta testing is
completed.  CORD will be organized as a subscription service,
similar to the network settlement agreement services Cibernet
currently offers.  

     Cibernet maintains itself as an "independent neutral body,"
not only as a back office go-between for CTIA members and clients,
but also in its support of competing technologies.  Both Ms. Nowak
and Ms. Brodman said they expect that the need for an independent
party only will increase as the proliferation of technologies and
wireless companies continues.

MCI, AMEX Offer Consolidated Billing

     In another move to capture shares in the business telephony
market, MCI Telecommunications Corp. announced an agreement with
American Express Travel Management Services, Inc., to consolidate
out-of-office long distance calling charges on American Express
corporate card billing statements.  

     The service works in conjunction with MCI's virtual private
network offering, "V-Net," and American Express corporate card
accounts.  For each call placed from a designated "V-Net" location
(e.g., a home office) to any other "on-net" location, MCI will
transfer call detail records to American Express, which matches the
originating location with the proper credit account--acting
essentially as a rebiller for MCI, according to an MCI spokesman. 
 In addition, long distance calls placed from cellular phones
(pointed to the MCI network) and credit card calls from pay phones
also are billed through AMEX.  

     All calls are priced based on the customer's prearranged VPN
rate, regardless of the originating location, the spokesman said. 
The AMEX bill will include detail reporting such as call duration,
origination, termination, and cost per minute.

Kenan's Arbor B/P To Support Prodigy 

     Kenan Technologies, a unit of Kenan Systems Corp., announced
that online service Prodigy will be the first customer for Arbor/BP
4.0, the latest version of its UNIX-based distributed billing and
customer care platform released last fall (CBR, Nov. 3, 1995). 
According to Kurt Silverman, Kenan Technology Executive
Director-product development, Prodigy's "highly distributed"
network architecture is complimentary to Arbor's client/server
configuration.  Unlike other installations, he said, "We did not
have to customize our platform at all to meet Prodigy's needs." 
Kenan expects to turn on service with Prodigy by March.

     Arbor B/P is a "customer-centric" billing and customer care
system, said Mr. Silverman.  It employs an SQL database and
customizable bill formats allowing bill generation in any language. 
The system also includes an online image server that delivers a
reproduction of billing statements to customer service
representatives.  The images also can be compressed and
transmitted, an application that looks forward to customer access
to bills over the Internet.

     The Prodigy installation does not include functions for
Internet-based billing, said Mr. Silverman, but he said some of its
functions "are not incompatible" with electronic billing
activities.  "Kenan is looking forward to the Internet as the next
platform for electronic transactions," he said.  Possible
applications for Arbor B/P include connecting a retailer's or
service provider's Internet site to clearinghouses for real-time
processing of credit card payments. 

     Kenan has created a developer environment for Arbor that
allows Prodigy and others to create application program interfaces
for customized functions.  Combined with the SQL database, Mr.
Silverman said, Arbor can be "optimized" for specific data queries. 
Prodigy, for example, will be able to identify which users are
using specific services, rather than having transaction data
supplied only on a "volume and number" basis.

Building a Blueprint for Convergence

By Rick Brown

     The recent passage and signing of the new telecommunications
law by President Clinton is expected to accelerate the demand for
convergence billing and customer care capabilities in the telecom
industry, as organizations implement offensive strategies for new
markets to enter, and develop defensive tactics for combating
encroachment on their turf.

     Convergence billing and customer care capabilities help
competitors "brand, bond, and bundle," in the words of one
organization with a major convergence effort under way.  Branding
establishes, or leverages, a single brand name for all of the
services a company offers.  Bonding builds strong ties with
customers by offering them "frequent talker" and other incentive
programs that cross lines of business.  Finally, bundling allows
the packaging of multiple services into compelling offerings or
special promotions.

     Convergence billing and customer care provides the capability
of offering combined bills, a single view of the customer, and
product and service offerings that cross lines of business (e.g.,
offering a free pay-per-view movie if a customer makes more than
$25 per month in long distance calls).

     It is by no means clear that convergence billing and customer
care are for every organization--or every customer.  It is part of
the folklore of convergence billing, for example, that consumers
may rebel when confronted with a large bill that includes costs of
several services, rather than several smaller ones.  It may be that
customer care with multiple bills is the best strategy for consumer
marketing, allowing branding and some amount of bonding and
bundling.

     On the other hand, one of the best things about convergence
billing is that, potentially at least, only one bill is being
mailed and only one payment is processed.  With low-revenue
consumer bills, mailing four or five remittances every month can
become expensive quickly.

     For business customers, convergence capabilities can provide
a significant advantage for competitors that offer them.  To date,
local exchange carriers and wireless carriers have, in many cases,
fallen far from meeting the billing needs of business customers,
particularly large ones with operations in multiple states.  

     The inevitable emergence of increased competition in these
markets will make billing capabilities a key differentiator, much
as it now is in the long distance market.  Business customers will
find favor also with competitors that can offer discounts for
bundling all their local, long distance and wireless service into
a single arrangement.

     Building or integrating a convergence billing and customer
care capability can be an arduous and expensive undertaking for an
organization, and it has a number of traps and pitfalls.  These
issues should be addressed when an organization is planning the
transition to convergence billing and customer care.

     Each organization will have its own set of business goals and
objectives for convergence; its own timetable for achieving them;
and its own set of current hardware, software, and data that must
be transitioned.  For these reasons building a detailed plan is
essential.

1.  Work Out the Business Issues First

     Convergence billing and customer care open up a whole raft of
business issues that should be dealt with before technical issues
are approached.  If the plan is to issue RFPs to vendors, having
some idea of how the converged businesses will be run will help
greatly in specifying what the vendors need to provide in its
solution.  If applications will be built or modified internally,
answers to the issues will aid internal information systems
organizations in the same way.  Some examples of common business
issues include the following:

     *    What organizational changes will be needed?

     *    How will sales, order processing, and customer support be
handled across the lines of business?

     *    Who will have ownership of the customer relationship
across the multiple lines of business?

     *    How will revenue be allocated in situations where
multiple lines of business are bundled under a single price to the
end customer?  How will the profitability of individual services be
assessed?

     Ideally, this should be a time when an organization can
explore new ideas about sales and support, like customer
self-provisioning and self-maintenance over the Internet, or the
elimination of billing altogether by offering fixed-price items
that are purchased at retail outlets or by credit card.  Increased
competition likely will lead to increased creativity in these
areas.

2.  Assess the Current Situation

     Once a set of working requirements for the convergence billing
and customer care environment have been developed, an organization
can evaluate the current system's ability to fulfill the
requirements or be modified to meet them.  "System" in this sense
is more than just software, it's also the people, organizations,
and procedures that surround the software.  Common items to assess
include the following:

     n  Do the current software applications and platforms merit
further investment, even if they are capable of being modified to
meet the requirements?  Since applications tend to bed in a wide
variety of states, this is unlikely to be a black-and-white issue. 
In fact, no large organization should expect to replace multiple,
large legacy applications in a short period of time, nor expect to
be able to replace them all at once.

     *    If the application is provided by a vendor, can the
vendor assess the ability to modify the package to meet the
requirements?  Issuing a convergence RFI is guaranteed to get the
incumbent vendor's attention, and it is useful in determining how
other packages might meet an organization's specific needs.

     *    Does the support infrastructure need to be addressed? 
For example, if the organization operates call centers, are they
equipped to meet the needs of the converged business?  Do they need
desktop PCs and wide-area network access?  Do they need more
sophisticated automated call handling systems?  For a large
organization, the cost of the support infrastructure can easily be
a substantial portion of the cost of a convergence project.

     *    Are there issues related to the location and staffing of
support centers?  For example, organizations that currently run
unionized call centers may not want to integrate new lines of
business into the current centers in order to keep the new
businesses non-unionized.  If the organization is entering markets
outside its traditional operating areas, the internal network may
need to be expanded to new areas and new support centers and
offices established.  If new lines of business will be integrated
into existing operations, how much training will be required for
current employees?

     *    If current lines of business will be converged, what are
the major issues related to merging customer information into a
common data store?  How are customers identified across lines of
business?

3.  Build the Blueprint

     The key items to building a detailed plan for implementing
convergence capabilities are the overall business plan, the
requirements for new capabilities, and the assessment of the
current situation.  If the business plan is extremely aggressive,
it is likely the same significant amount of the new capabilities
required will not be achievable on "opening day" for the new lines
of business.  In these cases, either the business plan must be
changed to match the reality of what is deliverable, or the
capabilities must be delivered in stages.

     Typically, a short-term strategy is devised to handle the
launch while minimizing risk and cost.  This may include putting a
proven existing application in place, with no convergence
capabilities initially, then integrating the billing and customer
care at a later date when the line of business has been established
and requirements have been better defined.

     If the addition of convergence capabilities is the main point
of the plan (for example, integrating the billing and customer care
for existing wireless and wireline lines of business), a
combination of short-term and long-term strategies may still make
sense.  

     A single customer data repository may be the highest priority,
or the production of a combined bill.  A short-term strategy would
focus on the highest priority items, while delivering the
longer-term solution in stages.

4.  Don't Promise the Impossible

     It is somewhat ironic that while business plans for
telecommunications often recognize the amount of time needed to run
fiber optic cable to every neighborhood in a city, or build
wireless cells to cover a region, software is often treated as
something that is simply expected to be ready on an arbitrary date. 
A few years ago one EDS customer announced internally that it would
completely reengineer its billing and customer care business
processes and systems within 18 months.  

     This carrier had taken more than five years to implement its
latest mainline billing application and hadn't yet fully
implemented it at the time it was making plans for the new systems
and processes.  Why were they sure it would be done in 18 months? 
Because they were told it had to be.  Within a year the effort had
been largely abandoned, a victim of a schedule with no connection
to reality.

     A common variation on this theme is to get a vendor to promise
to meet the arbitrary date, then blame it when the project fails. 
(Vendors sometimes have a pathological aversion to telling
customers no.)  Unrealistic schedules not only play havoc with
business plans, they prevent organizations from taking a fresh look
at how problems can be solved short term, while longer-term
solutions are put in place.  If the ideal solution can't be put in
place in six months, it's better to say that at the beginning, then
make plans to support the business that recognizes that fact.

5.  Keep Your Eyes on the Prize

     Customers do not care what kind of software generates their
bills or keeps track of their names and addresses, as long as it
works.  There should be some notion of proportionality to the
expenditures made for billing new services; it doesn't make sense
to spend tens of millions on changes to current applications to
support small amounts of revenue.  The objectives of convergence
billing and customer care initiatives should be to meet the needs
of the business and to do so cost-effectively.  Having a realistic
plan in place from the beginning that addresses the business issues
will help ensure both.

Convergence Demands Holistic 'Revenue Stream' Approach to Billing

By Vince D. Shaw, Deloitte & Touche

     An understanding of the importance of convergence issues on
billing and customer service is rapidly sweeping through the
telecom industry.  A new mindset, however, will be required to view
a customer's bill as the product of a series of systems and
processes that depend on many things not commonly understood to be
part of the billing process.  To understand billing effectively in
a world of telecom convergence, the revenue stream infrastructure
must be viewed as an integrated, interrelated whole.  Included are
processes to do the following:

     *    Establish service,

     *    Provide bills, and

     *    Collect revenues.  

     This concept has some important implications that are rarely
recognized.  Traditionally telcos have used the term billing system
to refer to message processing, rating, and bill assembly. 
Although this never was an accurate definition--even in the POTS
(plain old telephone service) environment--the damage was not too
severe since there were only a few, relatively simple products for
which to bill.

     This traditional definition, however, is no longer viable for
the array of products and services that even low-end customers now
expect to receive.  Nevertheless, the connotation persists that the
billing system is predominantly responsible for the bill itself. 
This perspective leads to misdirected efforts, confusion, and
frustration for customers and service providers alike.

     To realize the strategic potential of the billing system's
direct link to the customer, telcos must design their billing
capabilities with an eye toward numerous systems and procedures
outside the traditional billing process.  

     In fact, many of the things that determine whether a bill
reflects what the customer actually ordered--and whether the
customer's expectations are consistent with the bill--are linked to
information that the billing system assembles but does not create. 
Billing system designers, for example, must work very closely with
front-line customer service staff in order to appreciate the
aspects of billing that generate customer inquiries.

What is the 'Revenue Stream Infrastructure'?

     The revenue stream infrastructure includes not only the
traditional elements of billing but also the systems and processes
that support the following:

     *    Order entry and customer management,

     *    Accounts receivable, 

     *    Collections, and 

     *    Decision support and data warehouse functions derived
from the data contained in these systems.  

     Additionally, the infrastructure may include some elements of
provisioning and sales support, depending on the preference of the
provider and the degree to which these functions are integrated
with order entry.  

     The common thread among core functions is that they share a
common data model that describes the customer account structure as
well as all products and services.  The revenue stream processes
and systems, therefore, encompass the actions necessary to provide
services, bill for services, and collect revenues.

How Is the Revenue Stream Infrastructure Different?

     As billing issues become substantially more complex and
inseparable from overall customer service issues, telecom providers
must adopt a holistic revenue stream perspective in order to
survive.  This must be manifested both in terminology (e.g., don't
refer to "billing systems") and in organization (e.g.,
responsibility for billing quality must be assigned to someone at
the revenue systems level).

     "Billing" systems always have been dependent on the data
provided by order-entry and other related systems.  But the rapid
increase in the complexity of telecom products and services, and
the growing interdependence of the customer service and billing
functions, have made billing an inseparable part of the revenue
stream infrastructure.

     Reengineering of the billing function alone is unlikely to
succeed.  Any notion of reengineering that includes radical
redesign and major process improvements requires a broader focus
than that embodied in a billing-only scope.  While incremental
improvement can be achieved, radical improvement is unlikely.  That
is because billing systems traditionally are not a substantial
enough part of the revenue stream infrastructure.  

     Nevertheless, the cry, "We're reengineering our billing
process!" continues to be heard without a corresponding focus on
the wide range of issues that affect billing.  (Other impacts of
the revenue stream "perspective" are summarized in the table titled
"Interpreting the Revenue Stream," p. 10.)

What Specific Actions Are Dictated for Providers?

     Management responsibility must reflect the integrated nature
of the revenue stream.  If possible, a process "owner" must be
defined who has control across all of the revenue stream process. 
Designating separate managers for the systems that support billing
and order entry, for example, is virtually guaranteed to produce a
low-quality bill because there is no single point of accountability
for the various functions necessary to create the bill.

     A customer-driven focus to defining billing requirements is
needed.  While significant lip service is given to responding to
customer needs, the necessary actions often regress to the
traditional "We already know what the customer wants" approach.  A
recurring, objective process for monitoring customer requirements
is needed.  

     This means understanding  customer concerns and how billing
characteristics affect them.  For example, systems must be designed
to give customer service representatives a complete view across the
spectrum of available products.  The ability to quickly and
accurately answer a question is part of the overall billing
interaction in the customer's mind.

     Also, meaningful incentives should be offered for accurately
assessing customer expectations during the marketing and sales
process.  Sales people must understand that a bill is part of the
product being purchased; expectations regarding the bill must be as
clear as those regarding the rest of the product.

     Billing systems are a convenient target of criticism that
often is more appropriately directed at confusing policies
regarding pricing, proration, information display, or other things
that may generate customer queries.  Customer dissatisfaction with
such policies should not be confused with dissatisfaction about the
billing system.

     Service providers also must develop a core competency in
analyzing new billing requirements.  The bewildering array of
potential requirements often leads to the conclusion that
flexibility is the single necessary characteristic of a billing
system. 

     While system flexibility is critical, there is a practical
limit to the amount of flexibility that can be achieved.

     Flexibility should be supported in other ways, however, by
better preparing to handle the inevitable stream of new system
requirements.  This may entail establishing a formal process for
identifying new billing features that will provide a competitive
advantage.  

     Or if a company plans to outsource revenue stream processing,
it should focus on the degree to which the outsourcing contract
facilitates rapid, cost-effective response to new requirements as
it does on initial capabilities and costs.

     Finally, confusion about the underlying business reason for a
billing feature is, in our experience, the most common reason
implementation of billing requirements breaks down.  

     Therefore, focus on the process of correctly translating
business requirements into system requirements.  This is equally as
important as investing in flexible systems.  Prototyping, extensive
end-user involvement in design reviews, and early user involvement
in test planning will benefit this process.  Only by focusing on
complete revenue stream systems, rather than on traditional billing
systems, can companies resolve the billing issues raised by telecom
convergence.

Electronic Services industry practice of Deloitte & Touche
Consulting Group.  He is based in Washington, D.C., and specializes

CSG Goes Public Amid Market Uncertainty

     Billing services vendor CSG Systems International, Inc., will
offer 2.9 million shares of its stock in an initial public offering
for $13 per share.  The shares represent about 11.5 percent of the
company, which is valued at $382 million.  In 1994 the company was
purchased from First Data Corp. by its executive employees for $137
million.

     CSG is a leading provider of billing services for the cable TV
industry, with clients serving more than 16 million subscribers. 
It is facing the loss of major clients, however, as cable companies
increasingly opt to perform their own billing functions.  Among
these is CSG's second-largest customer, Tele-Communications, Inc.
(TCI).  

     The drive among cable TV companies to pull billing services
in-house is being driven by the desire to offer telephony and new
interactive services over coaxial cable networks, analysts have
noted.  These services require incremental billing and rating
capabilities that current billing platforms for cable TV cannot
handle.  

     In addition, large-scale billing outsourcers are facing
increasing completion from smaller processors that are much easier
for service providers to manage.  

     To counter the loss of outsourcing business, CSG has developed
"Phoenix."  The company had said the system is the first major
billing system based on client/server architecture and open
standards (CBR, Jan. 12).  

     Phoenix's first customer is Continental Cablevision, based in
Boston, which is also building an in-house billing and customer
care system dubbed "Concert."  Phoenix will be a major component of
the new system, but CSG will not finish installation until sometime
in the second quarter, and service is not scheduled to begin until
fall.

Loral Chief Taking Globalstar Reigns;
Move Seen as Plus for $2 Billion Project

     As part of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $10 billion deal to
acquire most of Loral Corp., Globalstar L.P. will get a respected
industry leader to champion it in the "Big LEO" (low earth-orbit)
mobile satellite services market.  Bernard Schwartz, Chairman of
Loral, will become Chairman and CEO of Loral Space and
Communications Corp., a new company to be formed in connection
with the Lockheed Martin/Loral deal.  Loral Space will be the
managing general partner of Globalstar, inheriting Loral's 31%
stake in Globalstar as well as other assets.

     Mr. Schwartz is widely credited with building Loral from an
unprofitable company two decades ago into a multibillion-dollar
industry leader today through a series of strategic acquisitions. 
The addition of Mr. Schwartz to the Globalstar management team
diminishes a major criticism of the $2 billion project, said
Robert Kaimowitz, a satellite communications analyst at Unterberg
Harris in New York.  Globalstar has been criticized for lacking a
focused management team, Mr. Kaimowitz noted.

     Mr. Schwartz said at a press conference announcing the deal
that he plans to focus most of his time on Globalstar.  Having
Mr. Schwartz champion Globalstar "strengthens" the global
communications project, Mr. Kaimowitz said, adding that Mr.
Schwartz's involvement "ensures that the system will be built."

     He expressed doubts that the competing global satellite
systems of Iridium, Inc. (led by Motorola, Inc.) and Odyssey (led
by TRW, Inc.) both would make it to the market.  In a research
report on Globalstar, analysts at Unterberg Harris recently
wrote:  "We do not believe that Iridium will present real
competition because of its complex [satellite] architecture,
expensive pricing, and murky marketing plan.  Although Odyssey
has proposed what many experts believe is the best system
architecture, we have yet to see signs that TRW/Teleglobe [of
Canada] is close to raising the money necessary to build the
system. . .Our view is that Globalstar's real competition will be
ICO Global Communications (Inmarsat-P), possibly resulting in
only two players in a potentially large market."

     Globalstar spokesman Tom Ross echoed similar comments
regarding Mr. Schwartz, noting that the executive's track record
is "very, very good."  In addition to his duties as Chairman and
CEO of Loral Space, Mr. Schwartz will become a Director and Vice
Chairman of Lockheed Martin.  Globalstar investors applauded the
news, sending its shares up $6.375 to close at $40.50 on the day
of the announcement.

Lockheed Martin To Buy Most of Loral

     In a deal valued at more than $10 billion, Lockheed Martin
will buy Loral's defense electronics and system integration
businesses for $9.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of assumed
debt.  It also will invest $344 million for a 20% equity position
in Loral Space at an effective price of $7.50 per share. 
Lockheed Martin will pay $38 in cash per share to Loral
shareholders through a tender offer that was scheduled to begin
Jan. 12.  Loral shareholders also will receive one share of Loral
Space for each share of Loral.  The transaction is expected to
close by the end of February.

     Loral Space will begin business with more than $700 million
in cash and no debt, the companies said.  Lockheed Martin will
provide Loral Space with support in key technologies while
remaining a major maker of military and commercial satellites. 
In addition to the 31% stake in Globalstar, Loral Space will
receive Loral's 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral, a commercial
satellite manufacturer, and its 22% interest in K&F Industries,
Inc., an aircraft brake company.

     Other assets of the new company will include all of Loral's
Globalstar service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico, and
Brazil and Loral's interest in proposed projects involving
domestic and international direct broadcast satellite (DBS) and
broadband data services.  Mr. Schwartz said Monday, Jan. 8, that
Loral Space will use its Space Systems/Loral holdings to expand
the new company's DBS business.

     Mr. Kaimowitz said Loral Space has a book value of $1.8
billion or $7.80 per share.  After backing out cash, Globalstar
represents 83% of the assets of Loral Space, he noted.  Loral
Space's book value is broken down as follows:

     *    The 31% interest in Globalstar ($650 million),

     *    The 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral ($150 million),

     *    The 22% interest in K&F ($50 million),

     *    2.8% in management fees from Globalstar ($250 million),

     *    $700 million in cash, and

     *    An undetermined value for the service provider
franchises.

Schwartz Holds Out for Higher Globalstar Value

     Mr. Schwartz said one reason Lockheed Martin did not acquire
all of Loral was the high price he placed on Loral's 31% interest
in Globalstar.  Seeing value in the creation of a global
communications network of 48 satellites, Mr. Schwartz pointed out
that globally, more than 3.9 billion people lack telephone
service, and 30 million people currently are waiting for a phone. 
If Globalstar begins service as scheduled in 1998, Mr. Schwartz
predicted that the company would have three million customers and
$2.7 billion in annual revenue by the year 2002.

     Globalstar's current capital structure consists of $300
million of equity from its 11 partners and $200 million of equity
from its initial public offering in February 1995.  Loral Space
is the largest Globalstar shareholder, followed by public
shareholders as a group and then Qualcomm, Inc., with an 8%
stake.  Vendor financing adds another $300 million, and a new
bank financing agreement chips in $250 million.  Additional
internal financing--payments from exclusive service providers
(the local telephone companies) in 73 countries--will contribute
another $350 million over the next few years.

     The $2 billion project still requires $600 million in
additional external financing.  Mr. Schwartz said that Globalstar
would try to raise the money in the debt markets or would turn to
Loral Space and Globalstar's other investors for the funds. 
Globalstar pulled a $400 million high-yield debt offering from
the market in October.  Mr. Kaimowitz said this happened not
because of a lack of investor interest, as widely believed, but
because Globalstar could get "debt at a cheaper price" from the
banks.

     He noted that Loral Space's $700 million in cash and no debt
provides "a vast opportunity to finance the Globalstar project in
very creative ways, with less need for traditional financing
methods."  

     The Lockheed Martin/Loral deal is subject to U.S. and
European antitrust and other approvals.  It also requires at
least two-thirds of Loral's shares to be tendered.

     Lockheed Martin Chairman Daniel Tellep and Mr. Schwartz said
they do not expect antitrust concerns to stymie the transaction,
especially since Loral's space business will remain a separate
company.  Mr. Kaimowitz agreed, noting that the businesses
Lockheed Martin is acquiring from Loral have very little overlap
with its existing operations.  A $10 billion credit agreement for
Lockheed Martin is being led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bank
of America, and Citicorp USA.

Intelsat Will Consider
Restructuring Plan This Year

     By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have
"a better idea of the future structure" of the international
satellite consortium, reports Maury J. Mechanick,
VP-international and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat
Corp.  Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," he said
during a public briefing on actions taken at the board's year-end
meeting in Washington.  A special Intelsat "working party" and a
special board committee are exploring the future structure of the
consortium, he explained.

     As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers.  Intelsat also will
restructure its sales and marketing division and establish new
internal accounting processes.

     Commenting on financial matters, Mr. Mechanick said the
board approved Intelsat's 1996 budget, which projects $876
million in total revenues and $496 million in capital
expenditures.  Those figures represent a 10.8% increase in
revenues and a 25% decrease in capital expenditures from the 1995
budget.  He said preliminary figures show actual 1995 revenues
totaling $800 million, while operating expenses were $75,000
under budget.

Sterling Software To Spin Off
Electronic Commerce Group

     One of the world's largest software development firms,
Sterling Software, Inc., will spin off its lucrative Electronic
Commerce group this year to create a wholly owned subsidiary,
Sterling Commerce, Inc.  According to Dawn Wheeler, who will
direct investor relations for the new company, an initial public
offering is scheduled for the first quarter of this year.  The
IPO will comprise 16% of Sterling's common stock.

     The company filed an S1 registration document with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 20, 1995, and expects
approval within 60 days.  Once the IPO is complete, the company
will begin a tax-free spin-off by Sept. 30, the end of Sterling's
fiscal year. 

     The Electronic Commerce group experienced growth of 35% in
1994--about 5% above the growth rate of the electronic commerce
market in that period, according to company figures.  This record
continued into 1995:  The group had revenues of $217.8 million
for the year, an increase of 31% over the previous year's figure. 
Operating profit increased 33% in the same period.

     The group's success is due, in large part, to its recent
focus on developing software for small and midsize businesses, as
well as its strong position in the electronic data interchange
(EDI) market.  In 1994, Sterling acquired American Business
Computer Company, Inc., a leading provider of EDI translation
software for the UNIX platform.

     But the most visible--and possibly the most important--move
for the Electronic Commerce group was its work last year with
Visa International, Inc., to develop the E-Pay system.  E-Pay is
a "fully electronic system for processing consumer-initiated
bills," the companies said.  It relies on a collection of EDI
standards that allow electronically generated bills and bill
payments to be processed by banks, billers, and other financial
institutions.  Sterling provides the key EDI-based software that
translates Visa account and customer information into a
standardized format and reconciles payee lists between billers
and their banks.  Currently, about 70% of electronic payments are
first converted to paper before being processed.  E-Pay, which is
designed to eliminate that step, will be a major building block
of Internet-based billing platforms of the future.

Analysts Cite Antitrust, Market Issues
For Possible Bell Atlantic-NYNEX Merger

     Although it would make "a lot of sense" for Bell Atlantic
Corp. and NYNEX Corp. to merge their local exchange or future
interexchange operations, antitrust and other issues could dampen
enthusiasm for pursuing a deal, industry analysts say.  Few were
surprised by recent press reports that executives of the two
companies have had preliminary merger discussions.  They note
that the "Northeast Corridor" market that a combined NYNEX-Bell
Atlantic could serve would provide substantial revenues if
federal legislation allows Bell companies to provide interLATA
(local access and transport area) services.

     "The synergy between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic is apparent
when you view their market," one interexchange industry observer
emphasizes.  The combined Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Washington areas would constitute "perhaps the most lucrative
single market in the U.S."  But some analysts caution that
increasing competition could erode the companies' local exchange
market shares.  They also warn that potential clashes over top
positions in the combined companies and layoffs could temper
enthusiasm for merger talks.

     Believing that the compromise on federal telecom legislation
is "very positive from a NYNEX perspective," analysts William D.
Vogel and Alexandra E. Kairis of NatWest Securities Corp. suggest
that a further combination of specific NYNEX-Bell Atlantic
businesses (not a full-blown merger) may make sense:  

     "The facilities-based test for local telephone company entry
into long distance does not specify any market share requirement
or percentage of lines passed by a second local carrier.  We
believe Congress understands that the long distance industry is
an overpriced cartel with excess capacity, and that more
competitors will result in lower prices and more meaningful
choices for residential and business customers. . .

     "NYNEX has fewer hurdles than any other Bell company.  With
the competitive environment fostered by the regulators in New
York and Massachusetts, NYNEX has already got facilities-based
competition as well as substantial unbundling of network elements
already under way.  We believe they will be fully compliant by
1997 if the present language passes.  This is great news for
customers because of the buying power NYNEX will have as it shops
for long distance minutes from AT&T, MCI, and Sprint on behalf of
its residential and business clients."

     They say "a case could be made that aggregating NYNEX and
Bell Atlantic's customer base to combine their buying power for
long distance minutes, as well as sharing marketing and
back-office costs, could make sense.  However, a full-blown
merger of the two companies at this time while the two firms are
already in the process of undertaking tremendous restructuring
programs seems provocative but unrealistic."

     A recent study Probe Research, Inc., explores the combined
performance of the NYNEX and Bell Atlantic telephone companies
between 1988 and 1994.  "The telephone side of the business for
these two companies is just not generating enormous returns,"
says Allan Tumolillo, Probe's Chief Operating Officer.  As
measured by revenues and assets per line, the performance of the
telcos has been "relatively flat," he notes.  Data for both
companies shows that per-line revenues and assets have increased
by less than 0.5% annually, according to The Telephone Book IV, a
report based on the study.  Similarly, measurements show that
revenues and assets increased about 7.5% per employee at both
companies during the period from 1988 to 1994.

     "They've achieved that because [Bell Atlantic and NYNEX]
have gotten rid of employees," Mr. Tumolillo explains.  "All the
cash flow has been generated through employee reductions."  The
combined number of employees dropped from about 143,600 in 1988
to about 105,400 at the end of 1994.  If the companies merge, Mr.
Tumolillo predicts they would eliminate duplicative positions and
reduce the payroll by about 10,000 more employees over the next
18 to 24 months, generating more cash flow.

     He suggests that a combined company "hunker down and become
a primarily urban company."  NYNEX has "no strategic reason" to
be in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire (except for the outlying
Boston suburbs), and some parts of central and upstate New York,
he says.  Independent telcos could purchase those exchanges,
pursuing a "clustering" strategy similar to that pursued by the
cable TV industry.

     Any merger discussions between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic
probably would not resemble the negotiations that preceded Bell
Atlantic's abortive attempt to merge with cable giant
Tele-Communications, Inc.  NYNEX and Bell Atlantic "know each
other's business very well," Mr. Tumolillo points out, citing the
companies' combined cellular operations.  Nevertheless,
leadership issues could arise.  Neither Bell Atlantic
Chairman/CEO Raymond W. Smith nor NYNEX Chairman/CEO Ivan G.
Seidenberg is nearing retirement age.

Relationship Already Exists Based on Cellular Deal

     Robert H. Mayer, Senior Manager-telecommunications
consulting for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, suggests that
a NYNEX-Bell Atlantic deal might come together smoothly because
the companies "already have a relationship through the cellular
business."  The CEOs "get along and have a vision" for their
companies, he says.  He also predicts substantial corporate
"downsizing" if a merger takes place, particularly in "corporate
services" units overseeing human relations, legal, and external
affairs functions.

     Commenting that the field is increasingly becoming a "market
for big players," Mr. Mayer expects any Bell company merger to
trigger a new flurry of deals between other telecom giants.  But
whether Bell company mergers can pass antitrust muster could
become the "$64,000 question," some observers believe.  The
Clinton administration "hasn't been very aggressive" in bringing
antitrust cases, Mr. Mayer notes.  "If the Democrats haven't been
[aggressive], Republicans probably would be even less so."  While
the Justice Department may not "put [Bell company mergers] under
a microscope," it will take action if it finds that predatory
pricing is being used to stifle competition, he says.

     Some analysts believe that Pacific Telesis Group could be a
potential Bell Atlantic-NYNEX partner, creating a "huge
enterprise" carrying traffic between the coasts--"the most
sizable and lucrative single chunk of the interexchange market,"
one observer says.  The three companies combined also could carry
half of the international traffic in the country, says Richard
Klugman, First Vice President at PaineWebber.

     Philip J. Sirlin, a telecom analyst at Schroder Wertheim &
Co., Inc., says a merged Bell Atlantic-NYNEX could have more
difficulty defending local exchange markets.  He also questions
whether any merger deal could satisfy both Messrs. Smith and
Seidenberg.  "This is never a trivial issue in a merger," he
says.  "And when you have two roughly equivalent companies,
you've got a particular problem. . .That alone reduces some of
the likelihood" that a merger deal will be concluded, he
suggests.

     Meanwhile, interexchange carriers are the new focus of
merger and acquisition discussions at Bell companies, Mr. Sirlin
says.  By acquiring an interexchange carrier such as LDDS
WorldCom, a Bell company could acquire a national network
relatively quickly.  "I wouldn't be surprised if every [Bell
company] is studying the feasibility of acquiring WorldCom right
now," he comments.  "And they should be."

The Telecom IPO Scoreboard:
How Did They Fare on Wall Street?

     This issue contains CBF's quarterly Telecom IPO Scoreboard
and related charts tracking upcoming initial public offerings. 
Every quarter, we report on companies poised to go public in the
next 30 to 60 days, those that have filed initial paperwork with
the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public in the
future, and the progress of companies that recently began trading
on the stock exchanges.  

     Readers can track the number of IPOs in telecom-related
sectors, how these IPOs are performing relative to the overall
market, and how one company's pubic offering fared on Wall Street
compared with that of others.  

     An increasing number of offerings (a larger pipeline of
money being fed into IPOs) would indicate greater venture capital
and entrepreneur interest in this sector.  A decrease in IPO
activity could indicate that interest is dampening or that the
market is reflecting information it has impounded about previous
offerings and is taking a "breather."

Impact of Legislation on Bell Companies
Depends on Regulatory Constraints

By Larry F. Darby

     Previous articles have discussed the probable effects of
regulatory reform legislation on various telecommunications
communities of interest--the broad public interest, consumers,
large users, the cable TV companies, and the long distance
carriers.  Such legislation is long overdue, and depending on the
final details to emerge from conference, the bills promise to add
considerably to development of the telecom infrastructure while
spurring economic growth and employment.

     The legislation will give users greater choice and lower
rates, both of which will accompany new market entry and
intensified competition among large, well-capitalized companies
whose markets now are protected from competition by statutory,
regulatory, and judicial barriers to market entry.

     The major threat to the enactment of legislation is that
some key lawmakers may succeed in imposing their view that
competition is too important to be left to the marketplace and
that our national welfare is best served by pervasive regulatory
interventions.  There still is considerable pressure from
interest groups to protect regulatory prerogatives and to have
major market conflicts resolved in administrative proceedings
rather than in the marketplace.  So, what else is new?

Bell Companies Are at a Turning Point

     We have deferred discussing the impact of legislation on the
Bell regional holding companies because much of the controversy
among House and Senate conferees centers on that issue.  It
remains to be determined whether, how, and to what extent the
final bill will permit RHCs to enter new markets and compete,
thereby compensating for the increased competition they will face
from long distance carriers and cable TV system operators in
their own core markets.

     The RHCs have evolved in very different directions, and
those differences will become more pronounced over time.  After
divestiture they shared some common goals:

     *    Become less reliant on regulated lines of business for
earnings,

     *    Reduce reliance on outside funding for network
construction and business expansion,

     *    Gradually finesse the line-of-business constraints
embodied in the Modified Final Judgment, and

     *    Meet shareholders' general requirements for growth and
earnings (in large measure by escaping the strictures of
rate-base, rate-of-return regulation).

     The RHCs generally have succeeded in meeting these broad
objectives, some more than others.  All have diversified their
earnings streams and growth opportunities.  Two of them --SBC
Communications, Inc., and U S WEST, Inc.--are generating about
half the basis for their total market capitalization outside the
regulated telephone business.  Wireless services and investments
in telecom assets in other countries make up the bulk of these
outside sources of market value.

     Most of the companies are able to fund their construction
requirements from depreciation accruals.  In recent quarters, the
sum of net income and depreciation charges has been about 15%
greater than the cash required to pay dividends and to fund the
construction budget.  (For context, we note that AT&T generates
about 50% more cash than is required for dividends and
construction, while the average for carriers in Europe is about
25% greater.)

     The companies have been quite successful in escaping the
confines of traditional earnings regulation that effectively
stripped them of the benefits of efficiency gains and
opportunities for earnings growth.  Price cap regulation of
federal access charges and a variety of incentive and price cap
plans in the states have almost completely supplanted
rate-of-return regulation as the dominant form of earnings
control.  These regulatory changes, more than any others, have
accounted for increased market valuation of these stocks in
recent years.

     Notwithstanding these successes, the Bell companies still
are trapped in the slowly growing, increasingly risky domestic
local wireline markets.  Market penetration is in the 95% range,
and new installations of primary lines are limited to the rate of
new housing starts.  Revenue growth from usage growth is stymied
in many jurisdictions by the imposition of flat-rate,
unlimited-use tariff structures.  In fact, usage-sensitive
pricing of local telephone services is unconstitutional in some
states.  

     The companies have been growing revenue by adding vertical,
value-added services made possible by software-controlled digital
switches.  Call waiting and forwarding and related services have
added handsomely to local revenues, but more ambitious forays
into broadband distribution--video dial tone, for example--have
not been too successful.  The RHCs still are burdened with rate
structures that do not match underlying cost structures, and the
resulting high-margin services have attracted considerable
interest from competitors.  New competition and the prospect of
even more entry (from long distance carriers and cable TV
systems) increases market risk substantially in the local
exchange.

Legislative Impact on Bells Depends on Regulatory Restraints

     The Bell companies look to the legislation (1) to permit
them to pursue new opportunities for growth and (2) for the means
to offset increases in market risk.  And when all is said and
done, the impact of the legislation on the RHCs depends on
details still being worked out.  Under any legislative outcome,
the Bells will be handicapped by their lack of experience in
competing openly in the marketplace.  J.B. Clark noted nearly a
century ago that "The greatest of all monopoly profits is the
quiet life."  So it is here.  Competition to date in the local
market is but a vague hint of what is about to come.

     Though the ultimate fate of Bell companies in the
marketplace will be determined by their ability to adjust from
the comfort of monopoly to the rigors of competition, the
legislation may either handicap them or accommodate their
transition.  Two elements of the legislation--and the way in
which regulators follow them up--are key to the Bells' success in
the new competitive environment.  The first is the timing of
competitive market entry; and second is the extent to which the
legislation imposes regulatory constraints on "competitive
adjustments" by the Bells and by their competitors.

     Time is money.  The timing of new competitive entry into
local and long distance markets is critical to the financial
valuation of both classes of carrier.  There has been much debate
in the conference committee about delaying RHC entry into the
long distance business until a date certain, or until specific
statutory requirements are met.  Frankly, I am a little puzzled
by that debate:  It is unclear how the public interest is served
by delaying RHC entry into the long distance market. 

     The argument that competition should be suppressed in that
market until it is more vigorous in the local exchange market is
not compelling.  The argument seems ultimately to turn on the
assumption that regulation is ineffective in prohibiting
anticompetitive market behavior.  Be that as it may, any
differences in the timing of lowering local and long distance
market entry barriers will be damaging to the Bells.  The battle
over customer control and the outcome of competing "one-stop
shopping" offers largely will be prejudged if the final bill
handicaps RHC entry into the long distance marketplace.

     A casual reading of the various "competitive checklists"
that have been advanced as necessary conditions precedent for
Bell company entry into the long distance market read like a
"communications lawyers' full employment act."   

     They are a sure blueprint for protracted market uncertainty
and regulatory/judicial delay.  Competitive safeguards in the
hands of clever legal advocates can be transformed into
regulatory barriers to entry.

     The second determinant of the impact that legislation will
have on the Bells has to do with competitive responses and
obligations.  AT&T and other long distance carriers have
supported language that will force the Bells to make bulk
capacity available to them for resale at "out-of-pocket" or
"avoidable" costs.  

     Despite economic efficiency arguments for such a
requirement, this pricing rule would permit long distance
carriers to avoid contributing to the fixed costs of the network,
thereby shifting that burden to other users.  In any event, such
a pricing rule would favor the long distance carriers to the
detriment of the local Bells.  Such a requirement, combined with
lags on the ability of the Bells to enter the long distance
market, would cause the RHCs to lose the accounts of large and
profitable customers to long distance carriers.  The RHCs'
ability to respond to new entrants and to defend their markets is
also critical.  In this regard, history is not very encouraging. 
AT&T was saddled with the regulatory baggage associated with its
designation by the FCC as a "dominant" carrier, long after the
market was regarded by most observers as workably competitive. 
The practical effect of such regulation has been, and will be,
"cartel management" by the regulators.

     The means of managing the allocation of market shares has
been the tariffing process--delays in the introduction of new
services and minimum rate restrictions on competitive services. 
New entrants' success in arguing that rate responses by
incumbents are predatory or embody cross-subsidies will be
critical to incumbents and new entrants alike.

     If legislators and regulators regard themselves as
instruments of market reallocation from incumbents to new
entrants, and if they adopt "fully distributed cost" allocation
rules for competitive services and "marginal cost" principles for
pricing resold bulk local capacity, the Bells will surely be big
losers.

UBS Analysts Tout Geoworks
For 'Concept-Oriented' Investors

     The pieces are "finally in place for the CCD (consumer
computing device) market to begin its long-awaited ramp,"
according to analysts Jeffrey A. Schelsinger and Scott W. Searle
at UBS Securities.  They view Geoworks, Inc.'s GEOS operating
system as "an enabling technology that will play an important
role in the development of this market.

     Given the "huge market opportunity for these devices, the
positioning of the company with leading consumer electronic
manufacturers, and the tremendous degree of operating leverage,
we believe Geoworks (GWRX) represents an excellent opportunity
for concept-oriented investors to play the convergence of network
computing and mobile communications."  Their investment thesis
follows:

     Over the last 20 years the binary world of ones and zeros
has driven tremendous change in the computer and communications
industries.  Maturing digital technology has facilitated market
transitions in these sectors, where companies with truly enabling
technology--technology that reduces cost and/or increases
functionality--have emerged to become industry leaders.

     When positioned on the right side of changes in technology,
investors have benefited from these market transitions. 
Centralized computing gave way to distributed processing and
desktop PCs (Compaq, Intel, Microsoft); stand-alone PCS were
connected into local area networks (Novell, Cisco, Bay Networks);
and now the promise of inter-networking and the Internet itself
(Spyglass, Netscape, UUNet) is creating very interesting
investment opportunities.

     Although much less mature, the wireless communications
industry also is undergoing significant change.  Analog
voice-centric networks are giving way to new digital systems
capable of efficient data communications.  Service markets once
characterized as monopolies/duopolies are becoming highly
competitive, as proliferation of wireless networks is occurring. 
Market focus and distribution channels for wireless products are
migrating from expensive verticals to low-cost mass consumer
markets.

     This is all well and good, but for the most part, the pony
is already out of the barn.  Where then is the next great
undiscovered opportunity?  Convergence.  The combination of
network computing and wireless communications will "untether"
users from enterprise networks and desktop PCs, thereby enhancing
the sharing and processing of information.

     As internetworking proliferates and the computing platform
becomes more hierarchical--the intelligence resides in the
network, not at the node--new consumer-oriented mobile computing
devices will emerge.  Online, as opposed to on-site, computing
places the "cost of computing" on the network and, therefore,
requires significantly less functionality in end-user devices. 
Less functionality means lower costs, which drives market
penetration.

     These next-generation devices will, however, have sufficient
computing resources to easily communicate with enterprise
networks, the Internet, and desktop PCS.  They will be packaged
in a truly mobile form factor (organizer/mobile telephone) and
have a cost structure consistent with other consumer electronic
devices.  All this is essential if the goal of indispensable
utility is to be reached (i.e., integrated into our daily lives).

     These new CCDs will start out as extensions of existing
consumer electronic product lines such as electronic organizers,
mobile companions, cellular telephones, and pagers.  In addition
to being interoperable with desktop PCs and enterprise networks,
these mobile devices will also support numerous wireless data
applications for messaging (e-mail, fax, and paging), information
delivery, remote access, and of course, the Internet.

     CCDs will utilize many existing digital technologies. 
Low-cost memory chips, fast and efficient microprocessors, and
high-resolution graphics displays all will be required.  The
idiosyncrasies of mobility and wireless communications, however, 
require new technology that will have to (1) be
communications-centric (wired and wireless), (2) be interoperable
with enterprise networks (the Internet and desktop PCs), and (3)
compensate for the limited bandwidth of wireless communications. 
The constraints of size, cost, and battery life are significant
in the world of mobility.

     With a focused strategy to deliver software products that
meet the price/performance demands of mobile computing, Geoworks
is well positioned to become a leading provider of operating
system and application software to the emerging CCD markets.  The
company's GEOS operating system offers a level of functionality
and efficiency that enables manufacturers of CCD devices
(electronic organizers and cellular telephones) to provide the
features and cost structure (less than $500 to the end-user)
necessary to penetrate the mass consumer market.

     Admittedly, the CCD market is in the early stages of
developing.  However, the adoption of the company's GEOS
operating system by several leading consumer electronic
manufacturers (Hewlett Packard, Nokia, and Toshiba) leaves
Geoworks very well positioned to capitalize on the convergence of
computing and wireless communications.

The Market:  Despite Failed Attempts, Huge Opportunity Exists

     The ability to tap into the vast organizer and mobile
telephone markets with value-added features will ultimately
ignite explosive unit volume growth.  We estimate that the total
CCD market will grow to $13 billion by 1998, with operating
system revenues accounting for approximately $250 million.

     First organizers & PDAs -- The organizer/PDA (personal
digital assistant) segment of the CCD market--devices priced at
more than $250--will drive early demand, as next-generation
mobile telephones ("smart phones") are not expected to be
introduced in Europe and Asia until late 1996.  The U.S. will be
at least another year behind because of a lack of digital
cellular/PCS infrastructure.  The organizer/PDA market segment is
forecast to grow from 4.4 million units in 1995 to 18.6 million
units in 1998.  Whereas low-end electronic organizers are
expected to grow only 6% per annum, PDAs with higher
functionality are forecast to grow 150% annually through 1998.

     The result:  a combined end-user market of $10.5 billion,
with PDAs representing 80% of the market.  Assuming royalties of
$10-$15 per unit, the organizer/PDA operating system market would
be valued at $186 million (based on $10 per unit) by 1998.  A
royalty of $10 per unit equates to less than 35% of the end-user
cost ($350) of a typical organizer/PDA CCD device.

     Then smart phones:  The worldwide market for digital mobile
phones is forecast to grow from 7 million handsets in 1995 to 20
million handsets in 1998, representing a $25 billion market. . .
An increasing percentage of these handsets is expected to
represent digital mobile phones with intelligent capabilities for
processing, storing, and communicating data information ("smart
phones").

     The installed base of smart phones is expected to reach 4
million by 1998, or approximately 20% of the digital phone
market. . .Assuming the smart phone market captures 10% of the
digital phone market, operating system revenues from this CCD
segment could exceed $75 million by 1998.

     Additionally, we believe the add-on product market could
represent an $80 million market by 1998, assuming one in two
purchasers of an organizer/PDA buys an add-on application for
$20.  We view this as conservative, in that Microsoft reports
add-on sales of 1:1 or better for applications relative to
operating system sales.

The Geoworks Solution

     Geoworks develops and markets operating systems and
applications for the emerging CCD market.  Geoworks' principal
system software, GEOS, is designed to meeting the constraints of
the mobile environment--limited microprocessor, memory, and
storage capacity.  GEOS provides a combination of functionality
and efficiency required by CCD hardware vendors in providing the
features and cost structure necessary for this market to follow
the explosive growth pattern of other successful consumer
electronics products.

     Strategy is simple:  Establish the GEOS operating system as
the de facto standard in the mobile CCD market.  Success at the
operating system level opens up the opportunity to sell
high-margin add-on software applications into the installed base
of users.  Initially, the target markets will be handheld
electronic organizers/PDAs (data-centric users) and smart phones
(voice-centric users).  Over time, higher-level information
appliances and interactive TV may be added.

     Strategic relationships --  Geoworks has entered into
strategic relationships with leading OEMs in the electronic
organizer and mobile telephone markets.  Several partners have
taken an equity interest in GWRX.

     *    Nokia -- The second leading provider of digital GSM
phones in Europe intends to incorporate GEOS in its first smart
phone, expected to be released next year.

     *    Hewlett-Packard -- It will incorporate the GEOS
operating system into a number of product lines, starting with
its sub-$350 electronic organizer, the Omnigo 100, which was
successfully introduced into European and U.S. markets this past
October.

n  Toshiba Corp. -- This leading consumer electronic manufacturer
plans to use GEOS in its development of smart phone products for
Asian markets.

n  Novell -- A leading provider of network operating systems, it
has authorized Geoworks to include Netware client software in its
GEOS system software for seamless integration with Novell
networks.

     Each of these companies has made a significant equity
investment in Geoworks for a combined ownership of approximately
18%.  Recognizing that wireless communications will drive
explosive growth in the CCD market, Geoworks has recently
announced a number of additional strategic alliances in this
area:

4  Notable Technologies -- provider of add-on software for
information delivery over paging networks;

4  Skytel -- leading provider of nationwide one-way and two-way
paging services;

4  Wynd Communications -- provider of wireless two-way messaging
services including e-mail via the Internet, fax, alpha paging,
and phone messages.

Leveraging the Model

     Geoworks' financial model maintains a tremendous amount of
operating leverage.  Unit volume growth in a royalty-driven
revenue model ($10-$15 per unit) drives contribution and earnings
as operating costs remain relatively fixed.  With increasing unit
volume shipments, we believe fully taxed net margins could exceed
20% in 1998.  This is reflected in our fiscal 1998 EPS estimate
of $0.50.

     Near term, the revenue stream will likely be lumpy,
reflecting the recognition of deferred revenues pertaining to
terminated projects.  In fiscal 1997 we project ships of
GEOS-based organizers/PDAs and smart phones to exceed 450,000 and
150,000 units, respectively.  This would represent royalty
revenues of approximately $7.5 million.  In addition, deferred
contract revenues of $3.5 to $4.0 million and add-on products'
sales bring total revenue in fiscal 1997 up to $13.3 million.

     For fiscal 1998, we anticipate total revenues of $38 million
($18.5 million in royalties plus $10.5 million from add-on
products).  In terms of operating expenses, we forecast healthy
growth in R&D expenses (25%-30%) to further develop GEOS and
add-on applications.  With sales and marketing provided by OEM
distribution channels, marketing and G&A expenses are expected to
grow modestly (15%-20%).  We believe positive operating leverage
can expand operating margins above 30% in fiscal 1998.

     Assuming the story unfolds as we think it will, and unit
volumes begin to ramp significantly in fiscal 1998, GWRX could
easily generate after-tax EPS in excess of $1.00 in fiscal 1999. 
Because of the high degree of operating leverage, this would only
require a 64% increase in revenues, year over year.  Furthermore,
if the company's existing OEM partners maintain their current
market share with respect to these next-generation products, our
fiscal 1999 numbers could prove conservative.

     Consequently, we have set our 18- to 24-month price target
at $30, or 30 times our tentative fiscal 1999 full-taxed EPS
estimate of $1.00.

The Year Ahead:  Merrill Lynch
Still Likes AirTouch Stock

     Analyst Linda J. Runyon at Merrill Lynch & Co. notes that
one of her firm's themes in 1995 was "to go international with
regard to cellular" holdings, and AirTouch Communications, Inc.
(ATI) "certainly fits this profile."  ATI is the sixth-largest
U.S. cellular company with 38 million population equivalents
("pops"), and the third-largest U.S. paging company with more
than 1.9 million pagers in service.  The company tops her
year-end list of recommended telecom/cellular stocks.  Ms.
Runyon's comments follow:

     ATI's international exposure continues to grow in both size
and importance.  In fact, the company now has more than 69
million "pops" through interests in licenses in Germany,
Portugal, Sweden, Belgium, South Korea, Italy, India, Spain, and
Japan.  For 1995, we estimate that ATI's proportional interests
in its international ventures will represent approximately 31% of
proportional revenues and 17% of proportional operating cash
flow.  By the year 2000 we believe that these numbers could grow
to as much as 46% and 44%, respectively.

     Moreover, we think that ATI's valuation is compelling at
these levels--especially given the 22% pullback in the shares
since mid-September.  On a valuation basis, we have a 12- to
18-month price objective of $35 per share, or 27% above current
levels.

What Has Changed?  Competition, from Within and Without

     *    First, we now have AT&T and MCI gearing up to go
head-to-head in wireless.  AT&T has recently gone nationwide with
its AT&T Wireless brand name, while MCI has chosen to go the
reseller route.  If MCI's experience with the resale of paging is
any indication of things to come in cellular, it could prove to
be an interesting year.

     *    Second, we now have more consumer packages being
introduced into the market.  We've got TeleGo from GTE and Talk
Along from Bell Atlantic/NYNEX.  Basically, we're starting to see
zone-sensitive packages, priced to attract the lower-usage
subscriber.  Nevertheless, revenue/subscriber/month continues to
decline faster than originally estimated.

     *    And third, personal communications services (PCS) are
coming, there's no doubt in our minds.  The first round of
auctions ended in March, and the second round of auctions is set
to begin shortly.  We've now got Sprint Spectrum PCS service in
Washington/Baltimore.  The question remains:  When does PCS
arrive on a widescale basis?  We think it's at least 1997-1998.

Current View:  Go Small or Go International?

     There's really no way around it.  Frankly, 1995 was a
difficult year for cellular equities. On average, the stocks in
our group are flat year-to-date and down over 30% relative to the
S&P 400.  As one portfolio manager pointed out, it was difficult
to perform that badly in 1995.  So, why did the stocks perform so
badly, and what does that mean for 1996?

     During 1995 the downward leg began with the PCS auctions,
continued with the LIN Broadcasting private market valuation
process, and gained new momentum this fall with concerns over the
rate of subscriber growth during 3Q 95.

     We understand the concerns over PCS.  We understand the
concerns over the LIN valuation.  So let's look at subscribers. 
During 3Q 95, subscribers included in our matrix of 19 companies
grew 42.4%, revenues grew 31.5%, and operating cash flow grew
42.3% versus 3Q 94--somewhat surprising given the stock
performance.  So, what is going on?

     Currently, the issue on everyone's mind is handset growth. 
Given comments by some of the equipment manufacturers regarding
U.S. analog handset revenue growth, the perception seems to be
that everyone who ever wanted a phone already has one, and that
growth as we know it has come to an end.  We don't happen to
agree, but it's interesting.

     In fact, over the course of the year, we have raised our
1995 ending subscriber estimate from 32.5 million to 34 million,
for 40.8% growth over 1994.  This implies a penetration rate for
the industry of more than 13.0%.  For 1996 we are estimating
ending subscribers of 44.4 million, up 30% over 1995, for a
penetration rate of 16.9%.  We'd like to point out that every
year so far--without exception--we have underestimated subscriber
growth.  But the question still remains, will 4Q 95 subscriber
growth be on target?  It's still too early to tell given that
50%-60% of the growth during the quarter comes in December.

     So, why go small or go international?  We recognize that
this is a repeat of our theme last year, and although it's small
consolation given the overall performance of the sector, smaller
market operators did outperform larger market operators during
1995.  We think that this trend could continue, given our belief
that competition will come to the smaller markets later and that
consolidation of smaller operators will continue over time.  With
regard to international, we see significant potential growth
opportunities, especially in some of the more underpenetrated
markets.  In many cases, we see international growth occurring at
a faster rate than growth here in the U.S.

1996 -- KEY ISSUES

     1.    Is subscriber growth slowing or not?  We think that
ultimately growth in net additions has to slow given the sheer
size of the wireless business.  However, we think that ending
subscriber numbers will continue to be strong in 1996, especially
given the added distribution power that AT&T and MCI will bring
to the table.

     2.    What exactly does PCS mean for the cellular business? 
When will PCS really enter the market?  How will it be priced? 
How will it affect growth?  How will it affect margins?  In other
markets, such as the U.K., the introduction of PCS has helped to
accelerate growth of the overall wireless market.  We expect that
this could ultimately occur in the U.S.  However, we don't
anticipate seeing widespread PCS until 1997-1998.

     3.    How is PCS going to be financed?  We think this could
be the single most important issue during 1996, as many of the
PCS operators look to raise financing within a similar time
frame.

     4.    And lastly, when will commercial CDMA (Code Division
Multiple Access) technology really be available, both for
cellular and for PCS?  We believe that ongoing uncertainty about
this issue will continue to cloud the competitive picture for
those cellular and PCS operators who have opted for CDMA.

BCI, INDIA's TATA GROUP IN TELECOM SERVICE PACTS

     Bell Canada International (BCI) and India's Tata Group have
formed a consortium to provide telecom services in the Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh, where the companies have won one of two
cellular telephone licenses.  The consortium also was found to
have submitted the only acceptable bid in the Jan. 1 bidding for
a basic telephone service license in Andhra Pradesh, BCI said.  

     Tata will hold 51% of the equity in the basic phone service
and cellular service companies, and BCI will own 39%.  The
remaining 10% will be held by American International Group, a
U.S. insurance firm.

     BCI said it could invest $35 million for the cellular
venture and about $100 million for the basic telephone service
venture.  Derek H. Burney, BCI's Chairman, President, and CEO,
said that "with cellular and basic service licenses in India,
cellular operations in Colombia and China, and cable [TV]
licenses in Brazil --each with strong local partners--BCI is
strategically positioned in some of the most attractive emerging
telecommunications markets in the world."

BROOKS FIBER ACQUIRES ENGINEERING, CONSULTING COMPANY

business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service" telecom
provider, the company said.  Brooks Telecommunications had owned
15% of Brooks Fiber.

     The move will give Brooks Fiber engineering and software
expertise, allowing it to offer customers a "new depth of
consultative support," according to CEO James C. Allen. 
Acquiring the domestic consulting unit--dubbed GLA International,
Inc.--will give Brooks Fiber more management information systems
(MIS) capabilities, improving its ability to meet interexchange
carrier (IXC) customers' service requirements, Mr. Allen said. 
IXCs have "voiced perpetual disappointment with MIS shortcomings
of the older [local exchange carriers]," he added.  Brooks Fiber
now will have about 300 employees and could have revenues of more
than $40 million in 1996, it said.

S.C. COMMISSION ORDERS BellSouth's PRICE CAPS

     In adopting a price cap plan for BellSouth
Telecommunications, Inc., the South Carolina Public Service
Commission properly has "recognized the need" for alternative
regulation of local exchange carriers, BellSouth says.  Greg
Morton, Director-corporate and external affairs in South
Carolina, told CBF, however, that a five-year "freeze" on basic
local service rates "is too long in a competitive environment." 
BellSouth had proposed a freeze for only three years.  

     Mr. Morton said BellSouth is "disappointed" that the PSC
included a 2.1% "productivity factor" in its recently adopted
price cap formula.  After the plan's fifth year, BellSouth will
be allowed to increase basic service rates by an amount equal to
the rate of inflation, minus the 2.1% productivity factor.  Its
intrastate switched access rates are capped for three years.  For
"nonbasic" (competitive and "discretionary," or optional)
services, BellSouth has pricing flexibility, subject to a 10%
annual limit on rate increases.  The PSC will maintain oversight
authority and can refuse to allow rate increases.

U S WEST EXCHANGE

     Pacific Telecom, Inc., has agreed to purchase 32 rural
Minnesota exchanges from U S WEST Communications, Inc., which
previously had announced that it would sell the exchanges to
another company, HTC Group.  

     That deal collapsed because of "a change of investment
priority on the part of HTC Group partners," according to a
statement issued jointly by all three companies.

     HTC still plans to acquire U S WEST exchanges in Iowa, and
the Bell company is negotiating with two or three other companies
to sell Nebraska exchanges, a U S WEST spokesman said.  Federal
and state regulatory approvals are needed before the exchanges
can be transferred.

AT&T TO SELL CIRCUIT BOARD PLANT IN RESTRUCTURING

     A retired AT&T Corp. executive has assembled an investment
team that plans to bid on the AT&T Microelectronics factory in
Richmond, Va., which is slated to be sold as part of the
company's streamlining and restructuring plan.  Hobart A. Weaver,
who helped start the Richmond Works printed circuit board factory
more than 20 years ago, told CBF Jan. 16 that he expects to
receive a sales proposal from AT&T within 60 days.  Mr. Weaver
said he has lined up New York investment bankers Peter Dixon and
Wilmer Thomas, with whom he has participated in several past
ventures, for bidding to acquire the plant.  He said he also
hopes to include the factory's almost 2,000 employees as
part-owners of a new public company.

     He said he informed AT&T last April that he was interested
in purchasing the plant.  Mr. Weaver, who retired from AT&T in
1982 as head of manufacturing operations in North Carolina, was
GM of the plant when it opened in 1973.  He said he has contacted
the Communications Workers of America local representing the
Richmond Works employees and expects the plant to remain a union
shop.  An AT&T spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Weaver's
plan, saying only that the company is "talking to several
potential buyers."

     The Richmond plant, which manufactures printed circuit
boards and "backplanes," has about 1,950 employees.  "We plan to
initiate discussions with potential buyers in the next few
weeks," said the unit's President, Curtis J. Crawford.  He said
the largest customer of the plant's products, AT&T Network
Systems, "expects to continue to depend upon the Richmond Works
as a major supplier after the sale."  CWA, which represents
nonmanagement employees at the plant, said, "We had just turned
the corner on making the plant profitable for the first time in a
long time, and this is the thanks we get."

     AT&T Microelectronics will become part of the systems and
technology company to be spun off from AT&T on Jan. 1, 1997.  A
spokesman for the unit said company planners see "no strategic
advantage in owning the factory. . .We find it makes more sense
to invest in some of our other businesses. . .Historically (we)
tended to make everything we needed," he said.  "But over the
years, we've reevaluated and asked whether we really need to be
making these [products] ourselves.  In the case of these circuit
boards, we decided we didn't."

ANALYSTS PRAISE PACIFIC BELL's NEW 'PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR'

     Rejecting requests to eliminate price cap regulation, the
California regulators have told Pacific Bell to freeze basic
local rates for at least three years.  They also adjusted Pacific
Bell's price cap "productivity factor."  Pacific Bell previously
was subject to a 5% factor.  The new factor is keyed to the rate
of inflation.

     John Gueldner, Pacific Bell VP-regulatory, said the action
"sends the right signal to companies based in California as well
as those considering investing here.  It will allow us to
continue investing in our California infrastructure and will
encourage economic growth and jobs throughout the state." 
Analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. viewed the PUC's decision as
"positive" for Pacific Telesis Group.  The analysts kept their
1996 earnings-per-share estimate of $2.55.

     "Had the 5% productivity factor been maintained, the
required rate reductions in 1996 would have been about $63
million (net of miscellaneous price increases)," they noted. 
Because of increasing local exchange service competition, Pacific
Bell likely will use its "downward pricing flexibility" to reduce
rates "for those services likely to be most targeted by
competitors," offsetting "much of the $63 million cushion"
provided by the PUC's recent decision, they added.

WARREN PUBLISHING ACQUIRES WASHINGTON TELECOM NEWSWIRE

     We're very proud to announce that Warren Publishing has
purchased Washington Telecom Newswire, a unique daily news service
covering the telecommunications industry.  As a wide variety of
Communications Daily subscribers already know, Washington Telecom
Newswire can be a very powerful complement to the Daily.

     Newswire subscribers receive, via fax or e-mail,
Washington-based telephone industry news stories throughout the
business day, usually within an hour of the event.  FCC and
congressional hearings, corporate press conferences and major
telephone industry developments are reported in Washington Telecom
Newswire before they appear anywhere else -- including "on the
Internet."

     The Newswire was purchased from Editor and Publisher Christine
Valmassei, who began the service in 1993 and will continue as
editor and publisher.  The Newswire will remain separate from Comm
Daily, with a separate editorial staff.

     Beginning in 1945, Warren Publishing pioneered first in
weekly, then daily and now almost hourly coverage of
communications.  As the pace continues to pick up in the industry,
we're ready for the next 50 years.

     We eagerly invite you to sample Washington Telecom Newswire at
no cost or obligation.  Simply call Warren Publishing Circulation
Manager Betty Alvine at 202-872-9200.

FCC SHUTDOWN MAKES IT DOUBTFUL JAN. 18 AGENDA MEETING WILL BE HELD

     Scheduled FCC agenda meeting on Jan. 18 now is very much in
doubt because of extended govt. shutdown over budget fight between
Administration and congressional Republicans.  It's Commission
policy that staff items to be considered at open meetings be sent
to commissioners by bureaus and offices involved 21 days before
meeting (CD Oct 23 p4), although that deadline can be waived by
commissioners.  Jan. 18 date hasn't been canceled formally, but FCC
sources told us it surely will be.  Other Commission matters also
will be delayed when govt. returns to work, they said, because no
one has been around to work on issues, digest comments, etc.

     Agency had scheduled Jan. 30 en banc session on spectrum
issues to be chaired by Comr. Ness because of her special interest.
At that meeting, new ways to allocate spectrum were to be discussed
by invited witnesses.  Commission is required by law to meet at
least once each month and there's now talk that Jan. 30 session
will be considered as meeting for month.  However, since agency
legally can't put out notices or news releases during
budget-mandated shutdown, any decisions must await its formal
return to work, according to sources.

     Among hardest hit by shutdown have been contractors, such as
maintenance, security, vending, transcription services.  Martin
Clark, pres. of ITS Inc. document service, said he's losing $20,000
daily and has laid off all but 10 of his work force of 45.  A few
are on board because auctions generated small amount of business,
he said.  Clark said he kept his employees on payroll during
week-long shutdown in Nov. but couldn't afford it in Dec. layoff.
He said he doesn't expect to recoup losses because experience has
shown his average daily revenues of $20,000 "don't change" after
snow days and other shutdowns.  ITS paid employees for Christmas
Day because "I just had to," Clark said.  "I'm angry, very angry
about this.  Millions of people across the United States that do
work for the government are hurt by this shutdown."

     Although most FCC employees were sent home because of lack of
funds, some were permitted to continue working on such things as
auctions, court arguments and international matters (CD Dec 19 p2).
FCC's Block C PCS auction began Dec. 18, first day of shutdown, and
ran through Dec. 21, when it took holiday recess.  Specialized
Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued week of Dec. 18.  SMR
auction resumes Jan. 2, Block C auction Jan. 5.  Auction staff
continued to work last week.  Call to Auction Div. Fri. revealed "7
or 8" employees were on board along with Wireless Bureau Chief
Michele Farquhar and Assoc. Bureau Chief Rosalind Allen in front
office.

     We're told couple of staffers from Office of Legislative &
Intergovernmental Affairs were in briefly Thurs. but were were gone
next day.  Gen. Counsel's office was staffed week of Dec. 18
because 2 court arguments were held that week.  Common Carrier
Bureau now is nearly empty, with only one employee classified as
essential to oversee network reliability;  same is case with Mass
Media Bureau.  "I am literally the only person on this floor," said
FCC employee on 8th floor Fri.

     Some commissioners have been seen entering and leaving
building from time to time during 2-week shutdown, not staying
long, but according to law their personal staffs aren't permitted
to work.  However, during Nov. shutdown, commissioners' staffers
continued to work by telephone, mostly from their homes, and in at
least one case met in Va. home of Jane Mago, senior legal adviser
to Comr. Chong, on children's issue in approval of Westinghouse
takeover of CBS (CD Nov 20 p1).

     Likely to be delayed by shutdown is approval of Disney Co.'s
$19-billion purchase of Cap/ABC, which had been expected to be on
agenda for Jan. 18 meeting.  Numerous deadlines for filing comments
have passed while Commission has been closed, including on AT&T
request to be reclassified as nondominant carrier for international
services, Southwestern Bell request to be classified as nondominant
provider of interstate services and Ameritech request to assess
end-user common line charges to resellers.  In addition to
comments, FCC will be hit with avalanche of petitions, complaints
and applications once agency reopens.  One lawyer said stacks of
petitions cover table in his firm's conference room, all waiting to
be filed.  "I can't imagine the long lines that will form" at FCC
filing rooms once shutdown is over, PCIA Regulatory Dir. Robert
Hoggarth said.

     Meanwhile, on Fri. President Clinton resumed meetings with
Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Gingrich
(R-Ga.) in effort to resolve budget issues.  Meetings were expected
to continue through New Year's weekend.

HILL SAYS BROADCASTERS WON'T GET 'GIVEAWAY'

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said Fri. that staff-level negotiations
have rejected White House proposal for broadcasters' early return
of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum.  Sources said
no deal has been reached on spectrum issues as high-level talks
continued at White House.  They also said that there would be "no
giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final budget deal.  Statement
contradicted assertion by Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who
was reported by Reuters Thurs. as objecting to what he called
"giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Dole also said there were
problems with telecom bill, but he wouldn't elaborate.

     Sources said some published estimates of value of analog
spectrum to be given back after conversion of broadcasting services
to digital technology have been wildly exaggerated.  While some
reports have put value of spectrum as high as $70 billion, sources
said figure is more in neighborhood of $6 billion.  That amount,
they said, wouldn't include costs to society of having industry and
consumers convert to new technologies before either is ready.
Negotiators also rejected White House proposal for $1-billion
subsidy to consumers to help them adjust to conversion through
purchase of set-top boxes.  Forcing consumers and industry in short
term to use technology that market hasn't found to be ready could
short-circuit development of advanced TV (ATV) services, Hill
sources said, adding that FCC has wide discretion to determine
whether ATV licenses should be awarded and what conditions should
be attached, including disposition of analog spectrum.

     Dole's assertion that there were "3, 4 or 5 provisions" in
bill that needed fixing also raised intriguing situation of having
him contradict rest of Senate leadership, including Commerce
Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) and senior committee Democrat
Hollings (D-S.C.), who said deal is in final form.  House
Republicans haven't accepted that, and still were working to make
changes, principally in sections that had been removed from bill
and that they wanted restored.

     For example, House sources said that Senate wanted removal of
provision that would preclude FCC from regulating Internet,
provision that was in House bill but not in Senate's.  House
measure, sponsored by Reps. Cox (R-Cal.), Wyden (D-Ore.) and White
(R-Wash.), passed by 420-4 as part of wider piece of bill also
aimed at combating cyberporn.  Republican sources said debate on
regulation provision revolved around argument that there's no
telling what services Internet would carry in future, whether it be
common carrier, mass media or video now regulated by separate
titles of Communications Act.  It didn't make sense to "preempt
regulation in perpetuity," sources said.  Sponsors were working to
have clauses restored.

     Similarly, Rep. Oxley (R-O.) would like language revived that
would lift restrictions on foreign ownership of common carrier
licenses.  Sources said there was no agreement between House and
Senate on measure, so it was dropped because Senate language that
would allow FCC to revoke licenses of foreign owners of U.S.
businesses was "worse than nothing."  Conferees will begin to
receive conference report this week after returning from break.
But some senators not only received it, but signed it, before
leaving for Christmas.  It will be up to parliamentary experts to
determine status of conference report if lawmakers have signed,
believing it to be final version, while others say it's still open
for discussion.  House sources said bill isn't final until majority
of conferees have voted for it, but at same time they don't expect
major changes.

     House sources said that bill "substantially reflects the work
of the House" in conference, noting particularly requirement for
facilities-based competition pushed by Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.), and checklist concept of Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.
Fields (R-Tex.).  Other parts, however, were "watered down by the
Senate," sources said, although Bliley believed that final product
should be supported.  Sources said House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
hasn't directed that specific changes be made, although meetings
this week may cover those subjects.  Gingrich and Majority Leader
Armey (R-Tex.) have said that problems with bill need to be
resolved.

CELLULAR MARKET GROWS 71.4% WITH ACCELERATED EXPANSION IN SOME
NATIONS

     Worldwide cellular market expanded 71.4% to 71.1 million from
mid-1994 to middle of last year, fueled by triple-digit gains in
emerging markets and healthy growth in industrial nations of
Europe, Asia, U.S. Commerce Dept. said in annual survey.  Through
6 months, growth was 35.6% globally, up from 52.4 million at end of
1994.  U.S. accounted for 43% of subscribers, followed by Japan
with 7.5%.  Scandinavian countries accounted for highest
penetration rates, in excess of 10%.

     "Midyear worldwide cellular subscribers reveal that the market
is still growing at an incredible rate," said Stephanie McCullough,
telecom analyst in Commerce's International Trade Administration
(ITA).  "There are developments on the horizon which will surely
accelerate that growth in several countries."

     Competition in Japan and Israel spurred double-digit growth --
122% in Japan and 110% in Israel, she said, as 2nd networks
accelerated subscriber base.  Similar trends are likely when
Belgium, Ireland, Korea, Taiwan and Poland introduce competition
this year, she said in report.  Indonesia ended 25% import duty on
cellular phones, which should cut prices from current $800-$2,500
range and accelerate growth, McCullough said.

     Small countries posted phenomenal growth "where the
introduction of wireless service is one way to meet the vast
pent-up demand for telephones," she said.  Colombia (1,666%),
Lebanon (1,100%), Bulgaria (723%), Ukraine (542%) and Belarus
(500%) led world, but markets of Greece (162%), Spain (93%), Norway
(76%) and Sweden (71%) also boomed, she said.

     Million-user group includes U.S. (31 million), Japan (5.3
million), U.K. (4.5 million), Germany (2.93 million), Italy (2.86
million), China (2.5 million), Australia (2.4 million), Korea (1.4
million) and France (1.1 million) as of mid-1994.  Poised to join:
Thailand (983,000), Norway (800,000), Brazil (750,000), McCullough
said in report, available only on Internet on ITA homepage
(http://www.ita.doc.gov).

     Latest survey, issued as govt. shutdown began, said Chinese
market could be most interesting this year, with UniCom building
out Global System for Mobile network to compete with provincial
networks.  Country will offer analysts opportunity to test dynamic
of 2 govt.-owned systems in competition.  "China, too, holds huge
potential for cellular growth," McCullough said.  Delays in
awarding licenses in India retard access to huge market, and use of
GSM technology could limit U.S. exports somewhat, she said.

     National breakdown showed govt. delays in Haiti have pushed
back award of national cellular license from late Sept. until early
this year, and in Austria collapse of ruling govt. threatened delay
in GSM tender offer.  In Australia, Spectrum Management Authority
is phasing out analog network with conversion to all-digital
technology by Jan. 2000, report showed, with users encouraged to
shift to Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone GSM networks.

     City of Baltimore has complained to American Personal

     City of Baltimore has complained to American Personal
Communications (APC) about interference from company's new PCS
service.  In Dec. 27 letter that also was sent to FCC, Md. Attorney
General's office said APC's PCS service is harming communications
service that supports Baltimore's mass transit system.  Utilities
Telecom Council (UTC), trade association that represents microwave
incumbents, said letter "validates the concerns that incumbents
have long expressed over the potential interference and severe
service disruption" that PCS could cause to microwave operators.
City said that on at least 2 occasions, APC created such serious
interference that Baltimore's communications links had to be
rerouted to telephone lines.  In both cases, it said, APC
transmitter was tuned improperly to interfering frequency.  City
said communications interruptions "posed a grave threat to public
safety," particularly since police communications also were
threatened.  Letter comes as APC is negotiating with Baltimore to
relocate city's communication system.  City said in letter that it
wants reimbursement for costs it incurred "as the result of APC's
negligent failure to properly tune and operate its transmitter."
Reimbursement can be either condition of future relocation or
separate payment if relocation agreement isn't reached, city said.

     CompuServe Pres. Robert Massey said Fri. he doesn't expect to
encounter opposition from other on-line services as result of
company's decision to block access to 200 Internet-based bulletin
boards at request of German prosecutors.  In interview on CNBC,
Massey said:  "CompuServe will comply with the law.  You will get
no argument from other on-line service providers over that.  This
is a major issue we are all wrestling with.  It's a very
controversial issue."  Massey said that although some members have
posted comments critical of CompuServe's actions, he hasn't heard
of any subscribers' dropping service.  He said CompuServe was in
unique position compared with other on-line services because half
of its subscribers are outside of U.S.  List of banned sites
circulating on Internet included several containing pornographic
photos but appeared to be based on words in their title rather than
content.  Some of banned areas include:  (1)
Alt.sex.bestiality.barney, reference to children's program
character.  (2) Alt.sexy.bald.captains, homage to Star Trek
character Capt. Jean-Luc Picard.  Several have discussions of gay
issues.

     City of Laredo and Time Warner (TW) were ordered to start
mediation proceedings in early Jan. by Texas state judge.  City
sued TW in dispute over transfer of its franchise to TW from
KBLCom, even though city refused to approve transfer (CD July 10
p6).  Nicholas Miller, Washington attorney for Laredo, said parties
had agreed on temporary injunction to block transfer until TW
offered motion to dissolve injunction.  City offered countermotion
to find receiver for system, but judge quashed both motions and
turned injunction into preliminary injunction.  He said in order
that city was likely to succeed on merits of case and set
preliminary court date in spring if mediation isn't successful.

COMMUNICATIONS TODAY'S TOP STORIES OF THE YEAR

     Here are some of the top-10 stories from the past year, as
determined by the editors of COMMUNICATIONS TODAY:

1.   TELECOM REFORM LEGISLATION

     It is not quite a done deal yet, but it certainly has dominated
the headlines during the past 12 months.  The Senate passed its
telecom bill (S. 652) in June, and the House followed suit in August
(H.R. 1555).  A 45-member conference committee now is trying to work
out--once and for all--sticky issues such as foreign ownership and
public utility company entry into telecom.

2.   THE PCS AUCTIONS

     The FCC's auction of 99 broadband PCS licenses (the "A"- and "B"-
blocks), which ended March 13 after 112 rounds of bidding, deposited
more than $7 billion into the government's coffers.  The next round--
the "C"-block auction--was scheduled to begin 75 days later, but due
to a series of long, drawn-out court challenges, the auctions didn't
actually get underway until Dec. 18, more than nine months later. 
Four rounds were completed before the holiday recess, with bids
reaching $1.2 billion.

3.   AT&T RESTRUCTURING

     The long-distance giant stunned Wall Street in late September
with the news that it was restructuring its single corporation into
three separate entities:  communications services, communications
equipment and transaction-intensive computing.  Chairman Robert Allen
said the move is the "next logical turn in AT&T's journey since
divestiture."

4.   SPRINT/DEUTSCHE TELEKOM/FRANCE TELECOM ALLIANCE

     The FCC approved the sale of 20 percent of Sprint Corp. to
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom last month, nearly a year and a
half after the deal was originally announced.  The foreign telcos each
will acquire 10 percent interests in Sprint as part of the Phoenix
alliance that will offer global telecom services.  Sprint also is
expected to earmark part of the funds for its broadband personal
communications services (PCS) venture.  Sprint also announced in 1995
that it was spinning off its cellular unit.  Analysts said the
cellular company, which has more than 1.2 million customers, is worth
between $3.6 billion and $5 billion.

5.   MCCAW PLUNKS MONEY INTO NEXTEL

     Cellular pioneer Craig McCaw shocked the telecommunications world
when he announced that he and his family would invest more than $1
billion in Nextel Communications Inc., the Rutherford, N.J.-based
specialized mobile radio (SMR) provider.

6.   FRONTIER AND ALC MERGE

     Frontier Corp. and ALC Communications announced in April that
they were merging to create the fifth largest interexchange carrier
(IXC) in the country.  Frontier paid approximately $1.8 billion for
ALC.

7.   DISNEY AND BELLS CREATE INTERACTIVE VENTURE

     The Walt Disney Co., Ameritech Corp., BellSouth Corp. and SBC
Communications announced in April that they were sinking $500 million
during the next five years into a venture that will create programming
to be played via the three regional holding companies' (RHCs) video
dialtone (VDT) networks.  The venture will rival the Tele-TV venture
formed by Pacific Telesis Group, Bell Atlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp..

8.   ROCHESTER BECOMES LABORATORY FOR LOCAL COMPETITION

     Rochester, N.Y., became the site for the first true test of
competition in the local telephone service marketplace.  AT&T and Time
Warner Inc. jumped into the city's local marketplace to challenge
incumbent provider Frontier Corp..  While Frontier declared the test a
success, AT&T and Time Warner complained that they could not turn a
profit by reselling Frontier's local service for 95 percent of the
retail price.

9.   MCI ALLIES WITH NEWS CORP.

     MCI Communications Corp. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. launched
an alliance that will mesh the strengths of the two companies to
create information, education and entertainment services for
businesses and consumers worldwide.  The companies each will invest
$200 million into the as-yet-unnamed venture.   The nation's second
largest long-distance company certainly had a busy 1995, acquiring SHL
Systemhouse Inc. [SHKIF], a Canadian-based information technology
services provider, for about $1 billion, and Nationwide Cellular
Service Inc. [NCEL] for $190 million.  MCI also plans to buy an equity
stake in News Corp. for $2 billion.

10.  PAGING INDUSTRY MARKS YEAR OF CONSOLIDATION

     Mergers and acquisitions highlighted 1995 for the paging
industry.  The biggest-ever merger in the industry occurred in
September, when MobileMedia Corp. bought BellSouth Corp.'s MobileComm
for $945 million to become the second-largest paging provider in the
country.  Arch Communications Group purchased USA Mobile
Communications for more than $450 million and Westlink Paging for $340
million.

FOCUS ON WORLD TELECOM NEWS

     A Hong Kong-based investment company has become the latest
foreign player to step into China's tightly restricted telecom market,
with plans to develop a $20 million global system for mobile
communications (GSM) for second national carrier Lian Tong
Telecommunications Corp. 
     CNK Telecommunications Services (CTS) is forming an equity joint
venture with Zhong Shan Group and China Unicom Equipment Co to finance
and build the network in Nanjing. The system, which will have an
initial capacity of 20,000 subscribers, will be operated by Lian Tong. 
However, the agreement provides for consultancy and maintenance
services to allow CTS to monitor the disbursement of project finance. 
     China currently prohibits foreign direct investment in telecom
networks as well as participation in the operation and management of
telecom services on the Mainland. 
     Like other similar Lian Tong projects, the CTS joint venture has
not yet been approved by the government nor has it been formally
incorporated.  To date, the government only has approved similar
investments by Nextel Communications Inc. in the Lian Tong Shanghai
GSM network and another GSM project in Suzhou involving Singapore
Telecom.  Other projects involving players such as Ameritech Corp.,
Telstra and Hongkong Telecom still are waiting approval. CTS was set
up by a private independent investment company, EK Investment Group,
to invest in telecom projects in China.  CTS will have an 80 percent
stake in the Lian Tong venture, with the remainder held by the Chinese

partners. 

BroadVision Lands Hong Kong Deal

     On-line software company BroadVision Inc. plans aggressive
expansion into Asia this year, following its selection by Hongkong
Telecom as a strategic supplier for a $1.28 billion interactive
multimedia services network.  The system, which is scheduled to go on
line in July, will deliver video on demand, home shopping and other
interactive on-line services to 80 percent of Hong Kong's 1.61 million
TV households within five years. 
     The Los Altos, Calif.-based company hopes Asian business will
account for more than 30 percent of its revenues by the end of 1996. 
As part of that effort, it plans to announce local partnerships
agreements and "significant" expansion plans into China in the coming
weeks, according to CEO Pehong Chen.    BroadVision is providing the
business operational support system for the Hongkong Telecom project.
Chen declined to comment on the progress of contract negotiations with
Hongkong Telecom.   However, William Lo, managing director of Hongkong
Telecom IMS Ltd., said negotiations over "minor" details have delayed
final agreement on most of the supplier contracts. Lo did note that
work is continuing despite the ongoing contract discussions.
     Contracts have yet to be signed with Hongkong Telecom's other key
suppliers: Fujitsu Ltd and Iwatani International Corp., which are
providing the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and access network
systems; Hewlett Packard Asia Pacific Ltd., which is supplying the
gateways and media servers; Sybase Inc., which beat out Oracle Corp.
for the middleware contract; and NEC Corp., which is supplying set top
boxes.  Lo hopes these contracts will be signed early next year.

DMTF Alters Mgm't Course

By:
BETH DAVIS

In a move that will delay the management of remote desktops,
the Desktop Management Task Force has scrapped its work on
a pivotal specification, opting instead for a standards-based
approach.

The group last week said it has stopped working on its Remote
Desktop Management Interface, slated for completion by the
new year.

Instead, the task force is now advocating the use of remote
procedure calls as the best approach for sending and accessing
information about the desktop across distributed networks.

The change of heart has slowed the DMTF's progress on a remote
specification, and network managers were divided on whether
the move will prove advantageous.

"I think it's a positive move to go with standards that are
already out there,'' said Arnold Howard, a senior PC LAN analyst
at a large financial institution in Boston. "Why reinvent the
wheel? Even if it doesn't have all the bells and whistles,
you end up with a broader base of customers and products."

Others see potential pitfalls. A single specification-like the
original RDMI-would ensure that the industry follows one set
of guidelines and applications vendors would have to write
code for only one method of communications.

Allowing use of different RPCs as the pipeline between the client
and server will force third-party vendors to either choose
which RPC they want to support or include code for all the
RPCs in their applications, said Glen Farrell, LAN system coordinator
at Firestone Textiles Co., Woodstock, Ontario.

"When it's multiple choice, it is not a standard. And RPCs are
proprietary solutions, even if they are widely implemented,''
said Rick Sturm, a principal at the Enterprise Management Institute,
San Francisco, and a network manager at one of the Bell companies.

"From a user's perspective, as long as the functionality is
there and you are able to exchange information even if you
are using more than one management application, it shouldn't
matter," said Ki Wilson, a senior microcomputer analyst at
Stone Container Corp., Chicago. "But since there is not a dominant
RPC on the market, that leaves an open-ended question for the
vendors as to which one to support."

DMTF chairman Ed Arrington said the switch keeps pace with the
organization's goals and objectives. "It is kind of a step
back, but we really want the market to make the decision here.
We don't want to be in the business of telling people what
to do," he said. "We're not a standards-forcer.''

In fact, that was the reason DMTF initially hesitated on a specification
that outlined a common way to access or send DMI information
across the network. The group had hoped the industry would
settle on a de facto standard.

Without a remoting specification, however, users must rely on
proprietary mechanisms to pass the management information that
is gathered by DMI across the network. When the industry failed
to rally around a single method, DMTF decided to develop its
own.

Since work began on the RDMI, several DMTF members have proposed
alternatives.

Last September, two proposals were presented: Distributed Computing
Environment, an IBM- and Microsoft Corp.-backed RPC; and the
Common Agent technology developed by IBM, Sun Microsystems
Inc. and several other companies.

After considering all options, DMTF decided on a Procedural
Interface, which Arrington said is "an easily remotable interface
that uses standard RPCs.''

Although the interface requires use of an RPC, it does not specify
which RPC to use. DMTF likely will allow the use of at least
three different RPCs, including DCE, Sun's Open Network Computing
and Novell Inc.'s Transport Independent RPC, Arrington said.

The interface enables an RPC to set up a pipeline between the
management application and the managed desktop. Like the original
RDMI, it will work with any connection, whether it is a LAN,
WAN or telephone link.

And though the work is several months behind DMTF's original
target of December 1995, using RPCs as the remoting technology
could mean products come to market faster. Many applications
ship with RPCs already embedded in them; for example, Microsoft
Windows 95 includes support for DCE.

The interface document has been drafted and is now undergoing
a second revision. It is expected to be completed in the next
few months, Arrington said.

In addition to the RPC remoting method, DMTF is completing its
work on the Simple Network Management Protocol-to-DMI mapping
agent. The technology will let SNMP applications manage DMI
compliant systems.

Although both the Procedural Interface and the SNMP-to-DMI mapping
agent are expected to be completed before the second half of
1996, Arrington said, they will be published with DMI 2.0,
which is slated to be introduced in March.

"Rolling those up into DMI 2.0 is going to provide a tight,
fully integrated, really powerful architecture,'' Arrington
said.

The next version of DMI includes several clarifications and
improvements, such as enhanced mapping technology and the addition
of an event model.

In addition, the DMTF this month will publish a formal product
registry that lists products that have undergone and passed
DMI-compliance tests.

The DMTF can be reached at http://www.dmtf.org or 503-264-9300.

SCO Unix to Get New Kernel

By:
EVAN SCHUMAN

Aiming to combine the best of two worlds for PC Unix users,
The Santa Cruz Operation Inc. is preparing a version of Unix
that will blend its popular OpenServer user interface and developer
tools with the guts of Novell Inc.'s UnixWare.

And though the project has the same code name-Gemini-as Novell's
former plan to merge UnixWare with NetWare at the microkernel,
SCO's strategy will abandon the so-called "SuperNOS" idea in
favor of a purer Unix approach, with NetWare technologies added
only for networking support.

Analysts and Unix OEMs said SCO's plan makes sense, and could
produce a server platform that carries with it a substantial
installed base and user familiarity, strong weapons in SCO's
battle with Microsoft Windows NT, the foremost competitor to
Unix in the Intel-based application server arena.

Tim Sheppard, PLC operating systems product manager in the server
system division at U.K.-based ICL, said he found the proposed
division of technologies for the merged Unix to be an ideal
combination.

"In terms of APIs [application programming interfaces] and in
terms of the user interface, I think it is a very logical way
of doing it," he said. "If it's done correctly, there is great
potential to get the best use of both."

Ever since the announcement last September that Novell would
sell Unix to Santa Cruz, Calif.-based SCO, technical managers
from both companies have been meeting to hammer out which elements
of their respective operating systems would survive in the
ultimate merged release, a product SCO plans to ship in early
1997.

The ultimate overriding concern was retaining existing independent
software vendor support, an area where SCO claimed a substantial
edge over Novell. SCO estimates that OpenServer has been outselling
UnixWare 2-to-1, with 12,000 applications shipping for Open
Server, compared with 850 for UnixWare, according to Jeff Ait,
SCO's vice president in charge of transition.

The strength of Novell's (and now SCO's) UnixWare is that it
is based on more advanced technology-namely, Unix System V
Release 4.2 (SVR4.2). SCO's OpenServer line was based on a
previous version of Unix, SVR3.2. So what SCO will combine
in the Gemini version of Unix, according to discussions with
SCO executives and Unix OEMs, are more advanced capabilities
of UnixWare. These include the SVR4.2-based kernel, as well
as its device drivers and multiprocessing support, security
and kernel-level threads, along with the attributes of OpenServer
that most attracted ISVs, such as its graphical user interface
and its systems administration tools. For years, SCO has opted
not to license any version of SVR4, preferring to stay with
the older license and replicating most of the SVR4 capabilities
with its own code. But the Novell deal changed all that, analysts
said.

"It sounds like they are really delivering on what they committed
to," said Tracy Corbo, a senior research analyst at International
Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. "They are actually taking this
to the next stage.

"The rules have changed. The whole game has changed," Corbo
said. SCO "now owns Unix" and the battle will be Microsoft
Windows NT versus Unix, rather than OpenServer versus UnixWare.

With Microsoft as a clear competitor, SCO's decision to go with
UnixWare's multiprocessor implementation is significant. NT
has been having difficulty scaling cleanly, as has NetWare,
while UnixWare has proven itself much more stable in high-end
Intel multiprocessor systems.

The lead SCO's OpenServer enjoys in third-party applications
support made the choice of an interface an easy one. "As a
platform, SCO was outselling UnixWare, so it would absolutely
make sense that they went with OpenServer as a GUI," said David
Watson, marketing manager at Informix Software Inc., one of
the largest UnixWare and OpenServer ISVs.

The change that SCO executives endorse most is the death of
Novell's SuperNOS concept. SuperNOS was a Novell proposal essentially
to merge UnixWare and NetWare using a microkernel approach.

SCO chief technical officer Doug Michels criticized the Novell
SuperNOS concept, saying Novell announced it before it figured
out how the concept would work. "They had a plan, which really
wasn't a plan: It was a goal," he said.

Although the next version of UnixWare integrates many of the more
popular features of NetWare-such as file, print and NetWare
Directory Services support, which also will be included in the
Gemini version of Unix-it falls far short of SuperNOS.

One of the reasons SCO is going out of its way to distance itself
from SuperNOS is because OEMs have told SCO that talk of SuperNOS
prompted several ISVs to hesitate to embrace the next version
of UnixWare.

Gerald Kerr, software product marketing manager at Unisys Corp.'s
Personal Computer division, a leading Unix OEM, said when Novell
first started talking up SuperNOS, "Unix users saw this tunnel.
And when these Unix users looked down the tunnel, they saw
these great big words: NetWare."

Kerr said users felt as if Novell was treating UnixWare as little
more than a migration for Unix users to move to NetWare.

With SCO, which has been championing Unix since its inception,
it is different, Kerr said. "Now those Unix users are starting
to look into the tunnel and they're seeing the word 'Unix,'
not 'UnixWare' or 'Unix Something Else.' "

Scott McGregor, SCO's senior vice president for products, said
although SCO will continue to use many NetWare capabilities,
the company is stopping short of claiming that one operating
system can handle everything equally well. "We're not saying
we're going to be as good at file and print," he said.

Compatibility Tools

SCO is also preparing a set of compatibility tools designed
to move users from the next UnixWare and OpenServer products
to Gemini. But the move won't be effortless.

"There's no way around the fact that OpenServer folks will have
to do some level of work" to port their applications to the
Gemini-merged Unix release, said Bob Sprowls, director of server
marketing at Unisys Corp., headquartered in Blue Bell, Pa.

TECH TRENDS: WEB INTERGRATION: CALL CENTERS GO ON-LINE

By:
MARGIE SEMILOF

A few network managers are looking to bring the same "page-pop"
principles used in computer-telephony applications to the Web.

Although industry pundits agree this is not a technology that
will take hold overnight, some managers of large call centers
believe they can extend their service offerings by giving on
line customers a way to speak directly to a service representative.

Robert MacRae at First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C., bank,
is one such manager. He wants to use Edify Corp.'s Electronic
Workforce application-development software to build Web applications
that give Individual Retirement Account customers a live agent
callback in response to a query from the Web.

First Union already operates a call center for 400,000 IRA customers,
as well as a Web site that posts information on the bank's
IRA services. It is looking for a way to bridge the two.

"Customers on the Internet get more information than those calling
in" on the voice-response unit, MacRae says. "But if someone
on the Web server has a question or a problem, we want them
to be able to click on a button and have their call transferred
to a representative, who can read from the same Web page."

Other managers also say they are interested in integrating call
centers with Web servers, though most aren't as far along in
plans.

"We are looking at ways to use live call-center reps to support
the provision of financial services on the Web," says Richard
Graham, vice president of telebanking administration at Signet
Banking Corp., Richmond, Va. "As to how that is done, we will
experiment. This [Edify] may be part of the answer, or our
answer may be as simple as a fax back or E-mail in response
to a question."

"We are just now looking into making our products available
to the public on the Internet," says Greg Johnston, manager
of integrated networks at Household Credit Services, Salinas,
Calif. "This Web call-center idea does pose interesting possibilities."

Edify's Solution

Edify, a Santa Clara, Calif., software developer, is doing its
best to make it as intriguing as possible. The company patented
an element to its Electronic Workforce application development
software last November that delivers what it calls "Web telephony
integration."

"In the long term, I think, this has a chance to redefine call
centers,'' says Charles Jolissant, Edify's chief technology
officer.

Electronic Workforce uses smart software agents to build interactive
response systems. Electronic Workforce sits on an IBM OS/2
server. The server sits on the network between phones and a
Web server. Edify officials say versions for additional platforms
also are in the works.

The telephony-integration software creates a Web session for
the call-center agent, giving the agent access to the same
information as the customer. Edify is also looking at ways
for the customer and agent to share information on-line.

Target applications include anywhere users browsing a Web page
may want additional information. For example, catalog shoppers
logged into a Web server may see an interesting item, but they
may find that the Web page does not answer all of their questions.

Developers can place a "call-me" button on the page that, once
clicked, alerts an agent from the catalog company's call center.
Moments later the agent can call the customer to help close
the sale.

Linking Mechanisms

There are two basic technical components that make it possible
to link a Web server to a PBX. The first is telephone control,
which is handled through computer-telephony-integration software
such as Northern Telecom Inc.'s Meridian Link or AT&T's ASAI
software-on the PBX.

But there also must be a way to get transaction information
to the call-center agent's desktop. One way is to develop a
custom application. Another is to use a Web browser to go through
the Electronic Workforce for the transaction information.

Despite this early enthusiasm for linking Web sites to call
centers, analysts said they are skeptical about the approach's
viability any time soon. They cite numerous unresolved technical
problems, Internet-related and otherwise.

"One issue is how do you establish a phone call and live link
to the screen, since the target customer is probably a consumer
with one phone line," says David Goodtree, an analyst at Forrester
Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting company.

The Internet itself poses several problems, says Bart Stuck,
president of Business Strategies, a Westport, Conn., consulting
company.

"The Internet is an unmanaged network and callback times are
likely to be unpredictable," he says. "Can the Web provide
the quality of service someone with a customer-service application
is looking for, or are you better off with something that is
private and dedicated?"

Some users with sophisticated call centers are also skeptical.

At Holiday Inn Worldwide, Atlanta, customers can reserve hotel
rooms via the Holiday Inn Web site. Les Ottolinghi, director
of emerging technologies at the hotel chain, says giving customers
access to an on-line chat room is a better way to answer their
questions than having them switch to a telephone.

"Using intelligent agents to search a database is more important,"
Ottolinghi says. "If for some reason a customer has to talk
to a person, they are better off going right to the call center
in the first place."

Frame-Relay Bargain Hunt

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

Looking for a frame-relay bargain? Now may be the best time
for some shrewd negotiating, industry experts say.

That's because it's still unclear whether an FCC mandate for
carriers to file tariffs for frame-relay services, starting
next month, will crimp their ability to cut good deals.

Already fierce competition among long-distance carriers has
put users in the driver's seat. But with service providers
offering complicated incentives, discounts and special offers,
users must carefully consider frame-relay service contracts,
industry experts said.

For frame-relay service "customers are knowledgeable enough
to get a good deal, but the shopping process is so complex
that getting the best deal is difficult,'' according to Steven
Taylor, president of Distributed Networking Associates, a Greensboro,
N.C., consulting company.

GAB Robins North America Inc. got a favorable frame-relay deal
from Sprint a year ago, after carefully renegotiating the rates
and terms of Sprint's standard frame-relay contract, said Carl
Longo, director of telecommunications at the Parsippany, N.J.
based insurance company.

"Since then, when I've talked to other potential Sprint frame
relay customers, they hadn't thought of a lot of things I told
them to think about,'' Longo said. "They don't look at the
terms of the contract very closely. They just look at the standard
agreement and sign on the bottom line.''

Customers who use competition to their advantage can negotiate
up-front financial credits, substantial discounts off carriers'
standard rates, initial waivers of minimum volume commitments,
free installation and free service for an initial month or
more, according to attorneys at Levine, Blaszak, Block & Boothby,
a Washington law firm that helps large companies negotiate
telecommunications-service contracts.

"If I had to give potential frame-relay customers one piece
of advice, it would be to use the market,'' said James Blaszak,
a partner at the law firm. "The only way to figure out where
frame-relay prices bottom out is to use competitive bids.''

As an example of the competitive environment, MCI Communications
Corp. often gives users with small-to-medium-sized networks
free installation and volume and term discounts ranging from
4 percent to 30 percent, said William Callahan, senior manager
of broadband data marketing at MCI.

A second level of higher but unspecified discounts offered by
MCI on a customer-specific basis kicks in if a customer spends
anywhere from around $15,000 a month or more on frame-relay
or if the customer has a substantial amount of other traffic
on MCI's network, according to Callahan.

Three Months' Free Service

In addition, MCI offers up to three months of free service for
customers who want to try frame-relay service or who want to
compare MCI's frame-relay service in a side-by-side test against
another carrier's, according to Callahan.

Sprint has a different approach, trying to avoid promotional
rates, said Brad Hokamp, director of advanced data services
at Sprint, although he added that "in specific cases, there
will be times when we are pressed to do that.''

Sprint's volume and term discounts, which range from 5 percent
to 30 percent, are part of its standard frame-relay rates and
will be included in Sprint's frame-relay tariff once the FCC's
tariff rules take effect, Hokamp said.

"The price level overall in the [frame-relay] marketplace will
decline a certain percentage in the next one to two years,''
Hokamp said. Once the tariff rules are in place, however, "there
will be a decline in the number of special deals that you will
see, but it won't be significant,'' he said.

Although officials at AT&T and LDDS WorldCom, the network-services
division of Worldcom Inc., Jackson, Miss., declined to comment
on their frame-relay incentives, evidence suggests that they,
too, offer lower prices to compete for specific customers.

'Very Aggressive'

"AT&T was very aggressive in their pricing strategy with us,''
said Bob Beck, director of enabling technology services at
Inacom Corp., an Omaha, Neb.-based provider of computer and
communications systems and services.

Inacom received "a very agreeable discount'' on AT&T's standard
rates, Beck said. Although Beck declined to provide an exact
figure, "the number is very competitive with the numbers we
received from their competitors,'' he said.

Today's environment of secrecy about frame-relay rates is expected
to end next month, when service providers will tariff their
frame-relay transport services to comply with a recent FCC
decision classifying frame-relay as a basic service that must
be tariffed.

Public Record

Although industry analysts differ on whether tariffing will
help or hurt frame-relay customers, they agree it will provide
a public record of the carriers' standard rates. And though
carriers still will be able to make special deals, the rates
contained in those deals will have to be tariffed individually,
the analysts said.

That could either hurt customers, by making the providers reluctant
to lower their rates beyond a certain level, or help customers,
by letting them compare rates paid by other customers in similar
situations.

For now, Levine, Blaszak, Block & Boothby advises clients to
disregard carriers' quoted rates for frame-relay service because
savvy customers, especially those with larger networks, can
save substantially by negotiating individual deals.

Limited-time promotions are also of questionable value, because
they don't reduce the rates a customer pays for the life of
a contract, attorneys at the firm said.

Looking to the bottom line, the law firm advises potential frame
relay customers to seek bids from numerous providers, compare
actual rates and keep contract terms to a minimum in case frame
relay rates continue to decrease.

Buying Into Objects -- Illustra will give Informix key database
technology

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

With its acquisition of Illustra Information Technologies Inc.,
Informix Software Inc. could leapfrog giants Oracle Corp.,
IBM and Sybase Inc. in the race to integrate management of
multimedia data objects in networked environments.

Through the acquisition, announced late last month and valued
at more than $400 million, Informix gained technology that
lets users create, store, manage and analyze complex data types,
such as images, audio, video and World Wide Web documents in
traditional relational database management systems.

Although the user base of such data is somewhat specialized,
the potential market has spurred other leading database vendors
to claim they, too, will be able to support similar functionality
in the near future.

Oracle, Redwood Shores, Calif., has already committed itself
to an object-relational model with its next-generation database,
Oracle8 (CommWeek, Aug. 21), while IBM is working on adding
new data types to DB2.

And Sybase Inc., Emeryville, Calif., has been quietly researching
adding object management to RDBMS server technology for four
years, according to company insiders.

Officials at Informix and Illustra said the Universal Server,
a merged object-relational database combining the technologies
of the two companies, would be delivered by the end of 1996.

Sanjeev Barma, research director for the Gartner Group Inc.
in Stamford, Conn., sees the ability to customize data types
and processes as the most important part of the object-relational
paradigm.

"Object-relational technology is going to be for 'Type A' companies
very aggressive ones that do much of their own programming,"
he said.

What Illustra lacks is what Informix has: on-line transaction
processing capabilities, multithreading, scalability to multiple
parallel-processing servers, enterprise-level reliability and
about 25 percent of the existing Unix-based relational database
market.

'Good Complement'

"Informix is a good complement to Illustra in that [Informix]
is highly scalable, reliability-tuned and massively parallel,"
said Linda Dozier, chief technologist at America Online Inc.'s
NaviSoft Inc. division in Santa Barbara, Calif. NaviSoft is
Illustra's biggest customer, using the Illustra Server as the
driving engine for AOL's Naviserver Web server.

"With AOL's on-line users growing at 30 percent per month, we
need that scalability," Dozier said.

The particular segments of the market that Oakland, Calif.-based
Illustra may add to Informix include the image and multimedia
management sectors. Illustra extends the search capabilities
to include the contents of images, rather than just the text
keys that have been entered along with images.

"From what I've read of Oracle8, it can't search within the
[multimedia] data types," said Steve Sommer, vice president
of marketing at Informix, Menlo Park, Calif. "We will be able
to search for images similar to a given image, with searches
based upon color, form and text."

Another Illustra user, Larry White, publisher of Hyperzine,
a World Wide Web-based magazine for professional photographers,
uses both Illustra's Web Data Blade and fuzzy search engine
in his implementation of Hyperzine.

"People can do a fuzzy search on the word camcorder and come
up with a review of a palmcorder, even though the review did
not contain the word camcorder," White said. White is not yet
using the image-form search capabilities of the Illustra database.

A Question of Meshing

In bringing these capabilities to an Informix product, the underlying
question for Informix and Illustra engineers may be one of
how readily the two companies' technologies will mesh.

"Before the acquisition, engineers from both of our companies
did a great deal of work to validate that our code bases could
be married together," said Bruce Gordon, vice president of
marketing at Illustra. "We feel very confident that we'll be
able to bring in the combined product by the end of the year."

"It's not a slam dunk," said Herb Edelstein, a partner at Euclid
Associates in Potomac, Md. "Each of these products has lots
of details and lots of events that must occur over the next
year before a merged product can come out." When it does, he
said, it will be "way ahead of Oracle8."

Oracle's Ken Jacobs, vice president of product strategies for
server products, would not give a time frame on the delivery
of Oracle8, but said "development is going along very well."

He also said Oracle is working on ways for the user to create
new data types in a way that is less intrusive than Illustra's
current methods.

"We don't consider it very robust to have to bring down a database
in order to add a new data type, as you have to do with Illustra,"
he said. "We feel the user should just be able to create a
new data type with a 'create-data-type' statement, the same
way they currently do to create a new table."

Study Critiques New Mail Systems

By:
JEFFREY SCHWARTZ

As many network managers choose new electronic-mail platforms
this year, they likely will discover that next-generation systems
from IBM, Microsoft Corp. and Novell Inc. are far from ideal
as enterprise-messaging backbones, according to a report published
late last month.

IBM's Lotus Notes Server, the Microsoft Exchange Server and
Novell's GroupWise XTD Server are new client/server-based-platforms
that provide marked improvements over aging earlier LAN-based
messaging systems, the "Decision 96" report from Rapport Communication
Inc. said. Rapport is a Washington consultancy specializing
in messaging systems.

Microsoft, Novell and IBM, through its acquisition of Lotus
Development Corp., sell the lion's share of LAN-based E-mail
systems. But although they supportindustry standards and offer
workgroup-computing features,all three emerging platforms will
vary and all have room for improvement, analysts said.

For instance, all three are weak when used in heterogeneous
messaging environments, said Rapport analysts, who gathered
their data from briefings with vendors and beta users.

Client and server directory structures on all platforms work
fine until connected to other E-mail platforms, said Gary Rowe
a Rapport principal. But none of the three products supports
true X.500 directory services at a protocol level.

IBM Scores Higher

Although Microsoft's and Novell's support for X.500 directory
services were considered insufficient, IBM received better
marks because of Lotus' expected support for native X.500 protocols
in its forthcoming Lotus Message Switch, said Dan Blum, a Rapport
consultant.

Officials from IBM and Microsoft could not be reached for comment
last week, but a Novell spokesman said the information about
GroupWise appeared to be accurate. Rapport analysts advised
network managers to run exhaustive pilots on more than one
system.

"I don't see a one-size-fits-all [solution] to messaging, but
the vendors that win out will be those that provide plug-and
play connectivity in heterogeneous shops," said Steve Cropper,
director of messaging systems at Charles Schwab & Co., a San
Francisco brokerage firm that is migrating 8,000 users off
of a host-based messaging system.

Most industry experts said they expect IBM, Microsoft and Novell
to remain the dominant suppliers of LAN-based E-mail software,
but there are competitive products from Banyan Systems Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Netscape Communications
Corp. worthy of consideration.

Lotus Notes 4.0 and Microsoft Exchange are expected to ship
early this year; Novell has said it expects to ship GroupWise
XTD in the second quarter.

The 130-page report critically analyzes the three platforms
and is available for $395.

Rapport can be reached at 513-777-4529.

Banyan Banking on Back-to-Basics Strategy

By:
SHARON FISHER

Users of Banyan Systems Inc.'s Vines say they are are hoping
the company's new "back-to-basics" approach will allow them
to hang on to their Banyan networks and the advantages they
offer.

John Curtis, senior vice president of Banyan's enterprise networks
division, said last week that this year the company will concentrate
more on enhancing and supporting its current line of products
and will focus less on vision statements.

Some users had been concerned about previous Banyan statements
that had left them with the impression that the company was
not committed to Vines, Curtis said.

"There'll be no more talk about 'Vines is dead' and there'll
be not as much talk, but more action," he said. "You won't
see us pronouncing grand visions."

As part of that plan, the company intends to release in the
next two or three quarters a new version of Vines will be easier
to use and that is better integrated with Windows NT (CommWeek,
Nov. 6, 1995)

Mixed Reviews

Analysts said Banyan's new strategy, which was outlined at news
meetings last month, is a solid move.

"They're pedaling as fast as they can from a development standpoint,
building on their core competency," said Glenn Gabriel Ben
Yosef, president of Clear Thinking Research Inc., a Boston
consultancy.

Users said they hoped the reorganization would help Banyan because
Vines offers features that are not provided by any other network
operating system. But the same users were not necessarily confident
about the future.

"As it is right now, there is still only one choice for an enterprise
network, and unfortunately I don't think Banyan realizes it,"
noted Gary Wescom, a computer systems engineer for Pacific
Gas & Electric Co., San Francisco. PG&E has some 20,000 PCs
on its Vines network.

"There are some things that companies, like PG&E, can't do without
the services of a network operating system like Banyan's, and
it doesn't appear that Microsoft is going to be able to provide
it very quickly," Wescom said. "We were looking at a pretty
scary time. Banyan had shown an interest in basically going
away-that was all the signs we were seeing-and to have them
still out there trying to continue on at least gives us the
feeling that we'll be able to keep our Banyan network operating
until something else comes along.

"But," he continued, "it's hard to have a whole lot of confidence
of Banyan withstanding the Microsoft onslaught for very long,
even if it is a superior product."

Other Banyan users said they were preparing for a future where
Vines would be integrated with other NOSs, such as Microsoft's
Windows NT.

Clinging to Vines

"I've invested in Vines, so I have a deep desire [that Banyan
survive], but at the same time we are doing everything we can
to integrate other Windows NT networks in with Vines," said
Eddie Albert, project manager of Banyan network operations
for the U.S. Air Force at the Pentagon. He is responsible for
251 Vines servers, and said he thinks the Air Force as a whole
which is integratingits bases worldwide-has 500 to 1,000 Vines
servers.

"Windows NT is a very good LAN and a very good file server,
but for the underlying backbone I would still use Banyan's
Vines, and that's the way I'm setting my networks up," Albert
said.

Banyan's Curtis said the new strategy is an extension of a company
wide reorganization last year that also included appointing
John Paul to head a division focused on Internet services (CommWeek,
Nov. 13, 1995)

"We've got good technology, but we haven't been focused on bringing
it into the modern world, on making Vines more friendly and
bringing Windows NT into it," Curtis said. "We had a lot of
things running at cross-purposes when it was a monolithic organization.
What John Paul and his people are doing requires a turn on
a dime; what we do is a consistent story and predictable path.
We were getting to where we weren't doing either one very well."

Keeping Customers Happy

Will Banyan still be an independent company by the end of this
year? "I can't disagree with that being a good question," Curtis
said. "If somebody big wants to acquire us, I think our customers
would say 'fine.' That's really my measure-are the customers
happy?"

Interview: Directing IBM's Server Strategy


Nicholas Donofrio is one of the most influential executives
in the server industry. Reporting directly to IBM chairman
and CEO Lou Gerstner, 29-year IBM veteran Donofrio oversees
all server activity at IBM, including mainframes, the AS/400,
the RS/6000 Unix workstations and a line of Intel-based PC
servers.

His current title is senior vice president and group executive,
but Donofrio began his career at IBM as a designer of semiconductor
chips.

Recently, Communications-Week editor at large Evan Schuman met
with Donofrio at IBM's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., for a
wide-ranging discussion of server issues. Here are some excerpts.

CommWeek: The Internet and multimedia applications are placing
unprecedented demands on hardware. How is this demand affecting
IBM's development of Internet and video servers?

Donofrio: In the final analysis, the power is in the bandwidth,
the I/O capability and the storage of most of these servers,
not necessarily in the processor. The exception is numerically
intensive processes, which need the processor to give all of
the answers. But that's not what the rest of the world is driven
by. That's probably not what the Internet is driven by. That's
not what multimedia is really driven by. It's just driven by
bandwidth and storage capability.

All of these servers are trying to grow up-to go from megabytes
to gigabytes to terabytes to petabytes. All of them need faster
channel and I/O structure. All of them have to get multiple
gigabit channel access to keep up with the demands-either multimedia
or data-in all kinds of forms. And they need the ability to
feed thousands of people in this very, very far-flung thing
we call the Internet.

Right now, people tolerate "server down, server busy, no access."
In the future that'll be less tolerated.

CommWeek: Are they tolerating it? Conventional wisdom today
has many users not returning to sites where they get repeated
busy signals.

Donofrio: Well, that depends on how badly you need the answer,
doesn't it? If you're browsing, I agree with you. Don't go
back. But that's not going to work if it's a transaction you
want to complete; if we're putting real commerce on the Internet.
Then it's not going to be "don't go back." You need to go back.
You started the transaction. You want to complete it or you
want whatever those goods or services are at the other end.

Not going back is not going to work as we get to electronic
commerce. We're going to need something more reliable, something
more predictable and something more deliverable. That's what
people are working on, trying to make these things more industrial
strength, along with security.

CommWeek: A recent trend is the proliferation of specialized
ser-vers, for electronic mail and Internet and other applications.
Do you see this continuing?

Donofrio: Depending on your size and scale, maybe you can have
four or five servers in your business. But when four or five
servers become 50 or 100 servers, that's a chore.

People are consolidating. One very simple example is how SP2
has gone into large businesses as a file or as a server consolidation
system. People just collect 50, 60, 100 servers, put them inside
an SP2 frame or two, and then manage them all from the same
physical point-all with the same system software. That's a
cost statement for a lot of our customers. They can't keep
up with a server a month for this or for that. And I don't
think a server a month is going to be in the future.

CommWeek: So you don't think there's a trend toward more specialized
servers?

Donofrio: No.

I think that during the last couple of years, that's what's
happened. But I think it is reversing now. Again, it depends
on the business or a small business, maybe two or three specialized
servers is all they need.

CommWeek: What about replicated sites? Or small branch offices
where users want an isolated E-mail server?

Donofrio: That works for some period of time. But what happens
when the server is the limiter? Suppose you have a server handling
500 people. When you're above that limit, replication is the
answer and you can stick gateways between the two so that they
can communicate. That's fine as long as you just don't need
more than 500 people interacting at the same time. But there
are lots of applications where you need tens of thousands of
people to interact at the same time.

The world can't just take what you've got and build replications
and put gateways in place. Res-ervations systems will not work
in that way. Large transaction, financial clearing systems
won't work that way. If the business has to close its books
every night, it won't work that way.

CommWeek: How would you describe the changed uses of mainframes?

Donofrio: More people are trying to use them as a central server.
We're trying to change our image and we're trying to change
the nomenclature, but we're not foolish. These 390 servers
still do the highest logical form of computing.

More people are using them for repositories. Whether they are
repositories of data the way we understand it today, or whether
it's more complex forms of data such as multimedia mixed with
regular data, they like the fact that it has all the bandwidth,
all the interconnectivity. They like the fact that it has the
systems management abilities.

CommWeek: Are there any mainframe applications that you've seen
disappearing over the past couple of years?

Donofrio: I think it's a matter of scale and some people can
get the job done with something that's different, that's smaller.
In some cases, they may be better serviced with a PC server
or an RS/6000 server. In a lot of cases, the applications aren't
available on a System 390.

CommWeek: A lot of users say there's too much capability on
the desktop, with servers relatively underutilized. Do you
agree?

Donofrio: We see a lot of that and you're going to see even
more of it. People are tired of trying to manage it. They're
tired of the costs and the questionable return on the investment.
And they know one size doesn't fit everybody in their business.
Not everybody needs the world's most powerful desktop or workstation.

We'll never go away from graphical user interface front ends
and things of that nature. But people are trying to figure
out what they're getting for the buck. There's always going
to be a balance.

ATM Gear to Support SVC -- StrataCom to emphasize extemporaneous
connections, security for ATM switches

By:
ERIC LACH

StrataCom Inc. will begin shipping software for its asynchronous
transfer mode switches next week to support switched virtual
connections.

SVCs let users build up and tear down connections on demand,
providing considerable savings over permanent virtual connections,
the other common means of connection for ATM.

Although StrataCom is not the first company to announce SVC
support on its ATM switches, it is the first major switch vendor
to do so. Analysts claim SVCs are key to ATM's long-term value.

"If ATM doesn't have the ability to support these casual collaborative
relationships, it is going to be tough to achieve the benefits
we think we will get out of ATM," said Tom Nolle, president
of Cimi Corp., a Voorhees, N.J., consultancy.

Other Selling Points

Users are likely to welcome the economies that SVCs offer.

"Right now we are using only PVCs because that is the only thing
we can get from both our switch vendors and carrier," said
John Steedman, an electronics engineer in the NASA communications
division at the Goddard Space Flight Center, located in Greenbelt,
Md.

Steedman said he has had problems with PVCs, particularly the
variable bit rate PVCs, because they steal resources whether
or not they are in use.

"SVCs would be a real advantage to us so that we could tear
down some of these VBR PVCs when we do not need them,'' Steedman
said.

StrataCom officials confirmed that the announcement would be
made this week.

Security Assurances

Sources said the company will offer ATM signaling and security
features to give users better control over SVCs on their ATM
networks. One key feature is support for both source- and destination
address screening, which lets users specify port by port a
list of ATM addresses for which they can receive or initiate
SVC calls.

StrataCom "is trying to address some of the security issues
that come with SVCs, because an SVC is like an ATM telephone
number-a dial-up call," Nolle said. "One problem with SVCs
is that someone who knows your ATM calling ID could breach
your network security because you might be running applications
that don't know they are using SVCs, and don't protect against
intrusion."

Some protection is considered mandatory for public networks
where many different companies are connected to the same ATM
service, giving them access to each other's ATM connected devices.

In addition to offering its own security safeguards, StrataCom,
San Jose, Calif., has said it will add more ATM security mechanisms,
such as those under consideration by the ATM Forum's new security
working group, once those specifications are available.

StrataCom's SVC software is available as a system upgrade. It
complies with the ATM User-to-Network Interface specification.
The ATM SVC signaling scheme also conforms to both ATM UNI
3.0 and 3.1 and provides a translation between these standards.

The company also will support ATM SVC signaling for the ATM
Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed interfaces when they
are delivered early this year.

StrataCom is also expected to announce support for the Interim
Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol, which provides interoperability
between multiple vendors' ATM switches and the Interim Local
Management Interface protocol for ATM connection management.

Congress Continues To Tinker With Bill

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

Landmark telecommunications legislation was put on hold until
after the budget crunch is resolved, but that didn't stop some
final tinkering on the bill by legislators late last month.

Although Congress adjourned at the end of December without acting
on the legislation, lawmakers negotiated and crafted a bill
that can be acted on quickly when it does comes up for a vote.
In recent weeks, conference committee members managed to get
the long distance and local telephone industries' support for
the legislation by granting limited concessions on key issues.

The recent alterations would increase government supervision
of Bell company entry into long distance and allow the Bell
companies to jointly market local and long distance services.
Legislators also decided to keep language that allows states
to continue their individual price-cap initiatives, according
to Capitol Hill sources.

Unresolved Issues

The work puts the finishing touches on the telecommunications
issues in the bill, but leaves more contentious broadcast issues,
mainly foreign ownership of stations, to be addressed. Both
the long distance and local telephone lobbying forces have
given a "grudging OK" to the bill, according to one long distance
lobbyist.

Initial language in the bill concerning the entry of the Bell
companies into long distance gave the FCC the decision-making
role in that process, but relegated the Department of Justice
to an advisory role (CommWeek, Dec. 18, 1995)

Before adjournment, the committee put greater weight behind
the Justice Department's simple advisory role, indicating that
Justice's opinion should be given "substantial weight" in any
decision made by the FCC.

"It's very important that they're back in the picture. It could
create a situation where the FCC is embarrassed into doing
something," said Jeffrey Kagan, president of Kagan Telecom
Associates, an Atlanta consulting company.

The Bell companies got the OK to jointly market local and long
distance services, something that was precluded in the original
language of the joint bill.

"That got the Bell companies on board," the lobbyist said.

Depending upon whom you talk to, the bill could either be passed
early this week or at the end of the month. A spokesman for
the Senate Commerce Committee said that if enough signatures
could be collected on the conference committee report, the
bill could be approved by Tuesday.

The House side holds the key to the bill, however, and observers
there said representatives are more guarded in their assessment
of the bill's timing.

New Year Ushers In More Urgent Role for Nets

By:
THE COMMWEEK STAFF

With the new year comes the promise of new products and technologies
that will let corporate networks take on a more critical role
in how business is conducted.

Key to this transformation of the corporate network from information
utility to strategic resource will be the Internet and Internet
related technologies. But they certainly won't be the only
driving force; corporate network managers will grapple with
a variety of other technologies and industry issues, such as
consolidation and new levels of competition in the telecommunications
market.

First drawn to the Internet and World Wide Web by the hype surrounding
it in 1995, network managers are expected to play a crucial
role in moving already established Internet connections to
a new level, using several new classes of products.

"Today we have generic software tools with base-level functionality,"
said Steve Franco, research analyst with the Yankee Group,
Boston. "In 1996 we'll see tools that add value and improve
existing business processes, like increased groupware functionality
for Internet software."

By the end of the year, many of those applications will include
encryption and digital signature techniques, which will let
users secure their communications. Companies will be able to
rely on more than firewalls to provide point-to-point encryption,
Franco said.

Also of particular importance will be a means to secure corporate
networks, especially those with an on-line presence. This likely
will induce businesses to use outside Web service bureaus,
which now host 50 percent of all commercial Web pages.

Web authoring and management tools will continue to gain momentum,
as applications accessed over the Web become more interactive.

As media buyers become accustomed to the Web, they increasingly
will seek to spread out expenditures to reach the specialized
audience segments that can be delivered reliably via the Web.

About $12.4 million was spent on paid HyperText links between
October and December alone, according to WebTrack Inc., a New
York-based market research company.

No doubt this amount will continue to grow at an exponential
rate as the pieces are put in place during 1996 to make electronic
commerce a reality.

Also, look for third-party auditing services to hammer out ways
to adequately track activity on a Web site.

Like the Internet, electronic mail will continue to gain acceptance.
Although Microsoft Exchange and the Lotus Message Switch will
be available this year, organizations will not make the move
overnight. Many are likely to pilot the new systems as well
as others, including Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Open Mail and Novell
Inc.'s GroupWise XTD.

E-Mail Possibilities

Because of the distributed nature of organizations, many shops
are likely to use a variety of E-mail clients and servers.

"People are going to start to understand how badly they need
directory services,'' said Terry McCarthy, president of New
York-based systems integrator Neoterik.

Also, as evidenced last year, messaging will become a core function
of collaborative computing systems and Web browsers, several
analysts said.

The Internet Engineering Task Force's newest version of the
Remote Monitoring specification will help that cause. The next
version, RMON2, expected to be completed this month, will boost
RMON's capabilities, letting network managers gather information
about network traffic at the application layer.

Leading network management platform vendors also are expected
to deliver their next-generation platforms.

Indeed, HP is aiming for the first half of 1996 for the rollout
of its fully distributed version of OpenView. The new version
enables the graphical user interfaces to be off-loaded onto
individual workstations while main-

taining one workstation as the Network Node Manager server.

Sun Microsystems Inc. has promised that its fourth iteration
of Solstice Enterprise Manager will ship this year; the commercial
version of the distributed management platform, which will
include object-oriented capabilities, will be available in
the second half of 1996.

Although some technologies will be regarded with skepticism,
others, such as ISDN and frame-relay, will continue to be adopted
en masse, according to experts.

"Frame-relay service is probably going to experience the same
tremendous amount of growth that it did in the last year,"
said Beth Gage, broadband consultant at TeleChoice Inc., a
Verona, N.J., consultancy. "Remote-LAN connectivity is probably
the largest application for frame-relay networks and that probably
won't change for awhile."

Slow Growth for ATM

The use of asynchronous transfer mode service for wide-area
connections is not expected to grow dramatically in the coming
year, although the planned introduction during 1996 of frame
relay-to-ATM service interworking by providers will let users
with frame-relay networks adopt ATM at high-speed sites, analysts
said.

"Interworking is a key issue for ATM," Gage said. "Interworking
will help ATM get off the ground, although we don't think 1996
is going to be the year for ATM."

Also during the year, FCC rules that require service providers
to tariff their frame-relay services probably will take effect,
although it's difficult to predict what the impact of tariffing
will be on frame-relay rates, observers said.

In the protocol arena, analysts said they expect to see more
consolidation in the TCP/IP software vendor arena, as competition
grows among companies that want to provide applications that
run over operating systems' native stacks.

More often than not, users will opt to use the stack that comes
with the operating system, and look for bells and whistles
elsewhere.

IBM is expected to make its proprietary operating systems more
open by enhancing its TCP/IP offerings, including offering
upgraded versions of its TCP/IP for MVS. The company may also
soup up its OS/2 Warp operating system with new TCP/IP features.

In the network operating systems area, Novell's plan for the
year is to focus on networking, its core competency. It will
also continue to compete with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT,
and, in particular, will encourage applications developers
and users to look on its NetWare Directory Services as an enterprise
wide, industry-standard directory.

"I think how [Novell's reorganization] plays out next year is
Novell really focuses their attention on keeping their installed
base, and driving NDS and NetWare services to become de facto
standards," said Jon Oltsik, an analyst at Forrester Research
Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consultancy.

For Banyan Systems Inc., the future is more problematic. "1996
is the 'do-or-die' year in terms of continuing to permeate
this idea of enterprise network services, and leverage StreetTalk
as an Internet directory or a corporate directory," said Mike
Rothman, vice president of the Meta Group Inc., a Reston, Va.,
consultancy.

Continued Acquisitions

Analysts predict the consolidation frenzy will continue in 1996.
In particular, they said, look for Cisco Systems Inc. to continue
making acquisitions.

3Com Corp.'s acquisitive mood may be diminished, however, because
of the difficulties it has had bringing Chipcom into its fold,
but Cabletron Systems Inc. and Bay Networks Inc. can be expected
to fill out their product lines or develop their customer base
or channels to market through small tactical purchases.

Even more turmoil can be expected in the telecommunications
market-with or without national telecommunications reform legislation.
But if the pending bill is signed into law, the telecommunications
industry will begin anew.

Getting Ready

All parties with a stake in the telecom market have been making
quiet preparations to enter into an intense battle.

For instance, AT&T's strategy is to use an existing structure
to enter the local services market. It is anticipating entering
local telecom markets this year and has even assigned sales
figures to some of its executives for 1996 that go beyond Ameritech's
Chicago and Grand Rapids, Mich., local competition trials.

If the telecommunications bill doesn't make it past President
Clinton's desk, state initiatives will carry the deregulatory
trend forward.

Blending Tech Into OpenDoc

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

The melding of Taligent Inc.'s compound document framework into
IBM's OpenDoc cross-platform, object-development environment
should give network managers wider access to more complex objects.

The Taligent technology will start to appear in IBM's Open Class
library next month, giving developers the ability to use it
to generate OpenDoc or Object Linking and Embedding parts,
said Jon Slitz, vice president of object technology marketing
at IBM.

The company is looking at a variety of ways to weave the Taligent
technology into the Open Class libraries and make it CORBA
2.0 compliant, according to IBM executives.

IBM took over Taligent as a wholly owned subsidiary last month
after a four-year venture with Apple Computer Inc. and Hewlett
Packard Co. The three companies formed the Cupertino, Calif.
based Taligent in 1991 to develop an object-oriented development
environment and operating system for the next generation of
PCs and workstations.

In addition to giving details about the role Taligent technology
will play in IBM's overall object strategy, IBM executives
said IBM will use its System Object Model (SOM) to capture
Microsoft Corp.'s OLE custom-control (OCX) component technology
for use in multiplatform environments. The company also outlined
future plans for its DB2 database.

Users of IBM's object solutions expressed disappointment about
the failure of the Taligent initiative and wondered if integrating
Taligent's compound-document framework was the right course
to take.

"I would have been more excited if IBM was defining a business
process engine rather than a compound-document engine," said
David Taylor, president of Enterprise Engines Inc., San Mateo,
Calif. "IBM has brought objects to the mainframe, which takes
the MIS guys out of a terrible conflict, but they just haven't
delivered on the [Taligent and OpenDoc] stuff," he said.

Taylor is more enthusiastic about the prospects of IBM's SOM
technology embracing OCX. "I heartily endorse that. OCXs are
brain-dead, in my opinion, and they will give the world a bad
impression of object technology. But, within a SOM wrapper,
they can become truly object-oriented, taking on polymorphism
and inheritance, and that would be great."

IBM's Slitz said, "You'll see from us a way to use OCXs in concert
with SOM, and they will be more robust in the sense that they
will be able to run in cross-platform environments. This is
part of IBM's continuing recognition that OLE exists in the
marketplace. We will create high-value ways of integrating
OLE into larger environments."

Future Plans

IBM also will bring its object technology to the World Wide
Web, developing a common application programming interface
to interface SOM objects with network middleware layers that
will bond the Web to back-end and legacy applications. In 1996,
IBM also will bring distributed naming and directory services
to the Web and expand its compound document architecture to
new data types, including coded and non-coded information.
"You will also see Java-based applications from IBM this year,"
Slitz said.

DB2 Expansions

IBM's plans for DB2 this year will include a growing number
of user-defined data types, according to Tim Negris, an IBM
vice president.

"In 1996, we will add to DB2 something called Cubic Query, or
querying based upon the contents of an image," he said.

For the real number crunchers, IBM will come out with a financial
modeling tool, called a Differential Equation Blaster.Negris
said that IBM, along with consulting service partners, would
introduce several data-mining applications.

WorldCom Extends Frame-Relay Services

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

LDDS WorldCom will expand its frame-relay network-to-network
interface service to Europe through agreements with undisclosed
European service providers this quarter.

The expansion will open another avenue for users to extend their
frame-relay networks globally.

In addition, LDDS WorldCom has extended its domestic WilPak
frame-relay network-to-network (NNI) capability to 10 additional
U.S. cities. During the first half of this year, the company
plans to continue an aggressive effort to extend its NNI reach,
said Emily Hansen, frame-relay product manager at LDDS WorldCom,
the network service division of WorldCom Inc., Jackson, Miss.

This will be an easy way for LDDS WorldCom "to expand its international
frame-relay coverage," said Tim Burke, an analyst at the Yankee
Group, a Boston consulting company.

For overseas connections, "NNI allows us to partner with another
company whose deployment of switches is denser than our own,"
Hansen said.

With LDDS WorldCom's NNI offering, customers connect localized
or regional sites using short-haul frame-relay circuits provided
by their local service providers. They connect the regional
frame-relay network to more distant sites through a physical
NNI connection to LDDS WorldCom's frame-relay network, the
company said.

Domestically, customers of LDDS WorldCom's NNI service pay standard
rates for the long distance portion of their networks, plus
the tariffed rate charged by the local provider for regional
frame-relay connections and a monthly fee for each 64 kilobit
per-second increment of capacity on the NNI connection.

In Brief: THE BALL DROPS WITHOUT NEW NOTES


IBM's Lotus Development Corp. would not confirm late last week
whether it met its year-end deadline to ship its new version
of Notes. But even if the vendor had Notes 4.0 out the door
before the ball dropped at New York's Times Square, analysts
said the company effectively missed the deadline because users
were unable to install the final commercial Notes 4.0 release
in 1995. Most users doubted Lotus would meet its promised deadline,
according to Dale Johnson, president of Johnson Consulting
Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consultancy.

In Brief: CISCO KILLS BUG


Cisco Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif., last week said that a
software bug temporarily shut down some of its Grand Junction
workgroup switches, knocking out about 300 LANs worldwide.
A glitch in the internal clocks of some FastSwitch 2100 and
2800 switches caused them to shut down at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday,
Dec. 27, and then restart at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 31.
The problem was not a virus but a system software error, Cisco
said last week. Engineers corrected the problem and do not
expect a recurrence.

MICROSOFT STRIKES BACK -- Besieged by Netscape, BackOffice delivers
a powerful and reliable NT-based Web server

By:
WAYNE RASH JR.

Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Information Server is clearly aimed
at the high end. Available only as a free beta download, there's
a good chance that you've already seen this product, since
it's the platform that's been running Microsoft's site on the
World Wide Web since last summer. As a result, Microsoft has
gained a great deal of experience at designing and implementing
a Windows NT-based Web server designed for heavy volumes and
high performance. The company has used this experience in creating
the commercial version of its Internet server.

In addition, when Microsoft ships the final version (available
either as a free download or for $99 in shrink-wrap), it will
bundle the ability to work with its SQL Server database. This
means that users who want to progress beyond "brochureware"
have an easy way to provide information to the Net. In fact,
the SQL Server database does not need to be located on the
Internet server, but instead can be located elsewhere on the
company network, which can ease the administration load and
reduce the requirement to duplicate data. Of course, if you
have a machine with enough capacity, you can locate SQL Server
on the Windows NT server that's running the Internet Information
Server.

The Microsoft Internet Information Server must run on a Windows
NT Server, version 3.51. In addition, it requires that Service
Pack 2 be applied before you attempt to install the server
software. Server Pack 2 was included on the CD-ROM that also
included the Internet Server, but it still requires an extra
step. Specifically, you must first apply the update software
(which is essentially an automatic process), reboot the computer
and load the Internet Server.

Installing the Internet Information Server is a nearly hands
off process. Once you make some basic choices, the installer
takes over and handles the rest. Adding to the ease of use
is a set of well-designed management and access tools. For
example, the server management package can run either on the
Windows NT machine itself or on a workstation elsewhere on
the network. In addition, the package can manage several Internet
Information Servers at a time, which can reduce workload and
make large sites much more practical to administer.

As you'd expect from a server aimed at high-end users, Microsoft's
Internet Information Server ships with effective management
tools. Able to run either on the server platform itself or
on a remote workstation, these tools manage server function
on any attached Internet Information Server. Although the nature
of Internet servers is such that the vast majority of such
management involves monitoring status, you can use Microsoft's
now-familiar tabbed notebook metaphor to change a variety of
operational and security settings.

In addition to its own management service, Microsoft includes
a Simple Network Management Protocol agent so you can keep
tabs on the Internet server as a part of a larger management
solution.

What Microsoft doesn't include, at least in this beta version,
is a World Wide Web authoring tool. Although such a tool is
available from Microsoft for use with Microsoft Word, it wasn'tshipped
in the Internet Information Server box. On the other hand,
Microsoft includes its Internet Explorer Web browser for Windows
3.1, Windows 95 and Windows NT. Unlike the vendors of some
World Wide Web-browser software, the versions included by Microsoft
can be distributed by network managers without additional fees.
Microsoft says that its server also will work with browsers
from other manufacturers, which we confirmed via Net-scape
Communications Corp.'s Netscape Navigator.

Another factor that makes the Microsoft Internet Information
Server easier to absorb into an organization is that it runs
on any hardware platform that supports Windows NT. This means
you can start running it on an Intel computer, but can move
to a PowerPC, MIPS or Alpha machine as your needs change.

Microsoft puts a lot of stock in its feature set, and with some
justification. Although it's not clear that most users will
need all the features included with the Internet Information
Server, at least if you do need them, they're there. Some of
the most useful features include an FTP service and a Gopher
service. Although these services are readily available from
third parties, it's convenient to have them bundled instead
of needing to purchase new software.

Likewise, Microsoft takes advantage of Windows NT Server's excellent
security to provide a server that can handle both password
and data encryption. You can disable anonymous log-ins, for
example.

Whether you should wait for the Internet Information Server
to ship or choose to move ahead now with Netscape Netsite or
O'Reilly & Associates Inc.'s WebSite depends on your level
of experience and needs. Netscape, for example, has shown an
admirable dedication to making sure its products are secure,
even to the extent of offering rewards to people who can break
its security. O'Reilly has long promised easy setup of a site
on the World Wide Web. Microsoft appears to offer both capabilities.

The fact that Microsoft has developed its Internet Information
Server for its own use in an extremely busy environment is
encouraging. Of course, the same can be said for Netscape's
products, so though Microsoft ranks with the leaders here,
it's not unique.

We found the process of installing and using Microsoft's Internet
Information Server to be anticlimactic. Unlike a number of
beta products we've been reviewing, this one works. If it ships
with complete documentation and competent support, Microsoft's
Internet Information Server could be an excellent solution
for businesses and organizations both small and large, especially
if valuable database content will be provided along with pretty
pictures.

CrossWind Multithreads

By:
RON COPELAND

CrossWind Technologies Inc. will announce next week a new version
of its real-time, enterprise-wide collaboration software, which
features a new multithreaded architecture to improve application
performance and extend application scalability to more than
50,000 users.

Synchronize 2.0 does this by taking advantage of the multi-threaded
capabilities of Microsoft Windows NT server and other Unix
environments. Multithreading, which optimizes the interaction
of the software with the underlying server hardware, is administrator
configurable. Client requests, inter-server communications
and disk I/O also can be optimized.

Synchronize is a platform- and electronic-mail-independent calendaring
and scheduling application that supports users and resources
across an enterprise network. The software lets users easily
schedule meetings and resources, distribute agendas and memos,
assign and track tasks and issue reminders, the company said.

The Synchronize software communicates directly across the TCP
IP network at network transport speeds to provide real-time
scheduling, task and resource management, said David Wellington,
president and CEO of CrossWind, Santa Cruz, Calif.

Synchronize 2.0 adds an Apple Macintosh client to the currently
available Window 3.x, Windows NT, X11/Motif and ASCII environments.
LAN-based and remote access are supported.

Synchronize 2.0 will be available in mid-February and will sell
for $100 per client.

CrossWind Technologies can be reached at http://www.crosswind.com
or 408-469-1780.

Sybase Previews App Upgrade

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

Sybase Inc.'s PowerSoft Corp. subsidiary has begun showing selected
corporate users a beta version of its next-generation PowerBuilder
5.0.

PowerSoft's new offering maintains the drag-and-drop simplicity
of previous versions and a 16-bit capability for Microsoft
Windows 3.1, but adds the 32-bit capabilities of Windows 95,
Windows NT, Unix and Apple Macintosh environments. Only PowerBuilder
for Windows 95 and Windows NT beta copies were shown to users.

Observers said they expect to see released copies of the Windows
versions in March, with Macintosh and Unix versions appearing
later this year.

"We're going to use it to solve maintenance and management problems
across thousands of clients," said Tom Cervenka, senior research
programmer for the University of Illinois university system,
in Urbana.

The new version of PowerBuilder performs practical application
partitioning across the network and offers an object management
facility, new data windows, the look and feel of Windows 95
and support for extended Object Linking and Embedding 2.0 automation.

In a future release PowerBuilder will offer "a World Wide Web
object inside it that would allow the creation of Web-enabled
applications and the recognition" of OLE Controls-based HyperText
Markup Language components," said Robert Zurek, director of
research and development for Sybase's PowerSoft division.

Depending upon the application, compiled code can run from two
to 10 times faster than the interpretive code of previous versions.

Pricing for PowerBuilder 5.0 has not been set.

EDA/SQL Gets Messaging Middleware

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

The next generation of Information Builders Inc.'s EDA/SQL will
offer corporate users both synchronous and asynchronous replication
options and the benefits of messaging middleware.

The New York middleware vendor announced last month it has licensed
message-oriented middleware technology from Mo- mentum Software
Corp. and will incorporate it into EDA/ SQL 4.0, which is expected
in March.

The incorporation of Momentum's X*IPC messaging middleware will
enable IBI's replication and gateway facilities to connect
remote servers in an asynchronous fashion.

"One of the advantages of the asynchronous aspect that Momentum
brings is performance. Users can fire off four queries or so
without having to wait for the first query results to come
back," said Alan Tonnesen, executive vice president of Insync
Software Corp., Ronkonkoma, N.Y.

EDA/SQL 4.0 can replicate data bidirectionally to roaming, heterogeneous
environments.

Pricing for the new version of EDA has yet to be determined.

IBI can be reached at http://www.ibi.com or 212-736-4433.

Banyan's New TCP/IP Backs Win 95

By:
Sharon Fisher

Banyan Systems Inc. has introduced a version of its TCP/IP applications
suite that supports Microsoft Windows 95 and includes a Web
browser.

Banyan TCP/IP Applications Suite 2.0 is an enhancement of software
licensed from Ipswitch Inc., Lexington, Mass. Originally, users
of Banyan's Vines network operating system obtained TCP/IP
access from FTP Software Inc., but Banyan, Westborough, Mass.,
switched to Ipswitch last year (CommWeek, Jan. 23, 1995)

"I like it so far," said John Herzog, network and information
center coordinator for Silicorp Ltd., Toronto. The company
is in the process of migrating directly from the FTP software
to the Ipswitch software, and is running it on 20 workstations,
planning to expand that to 300 this month, he said. "We're
about to try it out on the Internet. Corporately, it's solving
all of our needs."

The software has been rewritten to offer a 32-bit kernel, TCP
IP stack and applications, said Jeff Bernard, director of enterprise
marketing. This means that the software now works with Windows
95, he said. But the software is backwards-compatible with
16-bit applications, both from the previous version of the
Ipswitch product and with the FTP product, Bernard said.

In addition, the TCP/IP applications can run on the TCP/IP stack
built into Windows 95, Bernard said. In the next three months,
the company will release an Internet Protocol client that will
let network administrators integrate the Vines desktop with
TCP/IP services so only TCP/IP leaves the desktop, he said.
Ordinarily, Vines communications use Vines/IP, which is based
on TCP/IP, but is not compatible with it.

Other new features include IMosaic, a World Wide Web browser,
he said. "It is integrated, which makes it very easy for people
to get a well-supported product from us that leverages the
Internet."

The software now includes support for the Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol, which lets organizations share TCP/IP addresses through
dynamic configuration.

In addition, the software's VT320 emulation has been enhanced
to support The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s American National
Standards Institute terminal emulation, Bernard said. The software
is compatible with the industry-standard Winsock 1.1 application
programming interfaces, giving developers a standard way to
communicate with TCP/IP protocol stacks from Windows applications.
Winsock 2.0 will be supported when that specification is final,
Bernard said.

The software also is easier for network administrators to install
on multiple PCs, he said. Previously, the applications needed
to be installed individually on each PC from a floppy disk.
With the new version, the software can be installed from a
CD on the server to all the PCs simultaneously.

The software is available now. Prices start at $4,995 for a
50-user pack.

New UnixWare on Tap

By:
Evan Schuman

As officials of Unix's new owners-The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.
prepare for their first merged version of the operating system,
two new versions of UnixWare, formerly owned by Novell Inc.,
and SCO's OpenServer are in the wings and will start shipping
in volume in a matter of weeks.

The main attribute of the new version of UnixWare, code-named
"Eiger," which Novell had been calling UnixWare 2.1, is that
it will start integrating NetWare features, such as native
NetWare 4.1 file, print and directory services. This is meant
to let NetWare clients access files and printers via a UnixWare
server as if that server were running NetWare.

Gianfranco Enrico, the chief architect and architecture director
for Ing. C. Olivetti and Co. SpA, a Unix OEM, said he considered
the inclusion of the NetWare features to be essential. "We
expect it really will become standard for any Unix offering
to have NetWare services," he said.

Bob Sprowls, Unix OEM Unisys Corp.'s director of server marketing,
said his company's priorities were different from Novell's,
and the resultant release shows it. Novell's "goal was not
Unix, but was bringing in the NetWare stuff," he said. "Our
interest was more in enhancing the overall Unix environment."

Speedier Version

Other than NetWare features, the new version of UnixWare will
be slightly faster. Michael DeFazio, Novell's senior vice president
of development for the company's operating systems division,
estimated that the new version would be about 5 percent to
10 percent faster. Scott McGregor, SCO's senior vice president
for products, agreed with DeFazio's estimate for likely end
user impact but said the enhancements will be more dramatic
for OEMs performing benchmarking.

The next version of the operating system also supports some
of the newer disk drives and graphics cards and has a new C++
compiler.

A traditional sore spot with Unix licensees historically has
been pricing and licensing terms. Although OEMs generally say
Novell has done a far better job with licensing than its predecessor,
AT&T, SCO has nonetheless established a different pricing structure
with next month's release of Eiger.

The pricing change is "to make it more in line with OpenServer
pricing," said SCO's Jeff Ait, a vice president in charge of
the transition. Asked why Santa Cruz, Calif.-based SCO didn't
wait for the merged release to change pricing details, he said
the changes made market sense, regardless of the operating
system's sale.

SCO will be charging extra for various licensed capabilities,
which have not been offered before.

One OEM who was briefed said the changes involve moving away
from some of the unlimited number of user licenses Novell offers
to pricing determined by the number of users. "There are situations
where buying UnixWare will now be cheaper and situations where
it will now be more expensive," the OEM said.

With OpenServer's new version-code-named "Comet" and likely
to ship about 30 to 60 days after Eiger ships-the most significant
improvement is an increase in the maximum amount of RAM supported,
to 4 gigabytes from 512 megabytes.

"A lot of people who use large databases are concerned about
the amount of memory," McGregor said. "If you're a customer,
you just really want to know that you're not going to run out
of gas," he added.

IBM Support Uncertain for Warp Connect

By:
MARCIA A. JACOBS

IBM's commitment to the PowerPC version of its Warp Connect
operating system software is waning. The company missed its
year-end "shipment" date and announced a complex ordering plan.

The product's lateness and the uncertainty about exactly which
features of Warp Connect made it into the PowerPC version have
users and analysts questioning the need for it.

"I don't think the market cares anymore,'' said Tom Kurcharvy,
an analyst at Summit Strategies Inc., Boston. "IBM did more
to destroy momentum for the PowerPC than any company ever did.''

George Szatckowski, senior technical support specialist at the
Chicago railroad company Metra, agreed. "At the moment, we
have no PowerPCs. There are no specific plans for it.'' The
company uses Unix for its high-end graphics programs and doesn't
see any reason to switch.

Would-be Warp Connect PPC users must order custom machines for
desktops or servers from IBM.

At least one user cited scalability as a need for Warp Connect
PPC. "I'm definitely interested from the perspective of having
a more scalable architecture,'' said Arlene Allen, assistant
director of information systems at the University of California
at Santa Barbara.

IBM said Microsoft Windows applications that run on Warp will
run on Warp Connect PPC, but Warp applications must be recompiled
first. Kurcharvy said that if Warp Connect PPC only runs Windows
applications, the need for buying Warp Connect PPC does not
exist because Microsoft Windows NT already runs on the PowerPC
(CommWeek, May 15)

Warp Connect for the PowerPC will be priced the same as Warp
Connect, which retails for $299 with Windows included, and
$229 without the upgrade.

IBM can be reached at http://www.ibm.com or 800-426-4968.

Microsoft Hones In on IP

By:
AMY ROGERS

In hindsight, 1995 may be regarded as the year that TCP/IP hit
the big time.

This is due in no small part to Microsoft Corp.'s bundling of
a TCP/IP protocol stack into its Windows 95, thus making the
protocols upon which the Internet operates widely available.

Last year, many users opted to run Microsoft's less-sophisticated
Internet Protocol stack to save themselves the hassle of substituting
another vendor's stack. The Windows 95 "stack is not elegant,
but it works," said Doug McDonald, a technical services manager
in the MIS department at Rogue Valley Medical Center, Medford,
Ore.

But, he added, "it doesn't have all the applications that NetManage
or Frontier or WRQ has."

Last year, traditional stack vendors, such as NetManage Inc.
and WRQ, started focusing on creating value-added applications
that run equally well on their own stacks and over Microsoft's.

For example, NetManage, Cupertino, Calif., said it would provide
software to let users access extra bandwidth for running applications.

Frontier Technologies Corp., Mequon, Wis., bundled a suite of
TCP/IP applications with its CyberJunction gateway, which converts
Novell Inc.'s Internetwork Packet Exchange protocol into TCP
IP for running network utilities and for Internet access.

TGV Software Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif., upgraded its MultiNet
for Windows by adding a feature that lets users choose among
various TCP/IP applications.

In many cases, Internet access is not the primary reason network
managers are rushing to implement stacks and applications.
In 1995, managers wanted stacks for file-sharing applications,
to send and receive electronic mail and to access host data
via terminal emulation.

As these managers turned elsewhere for TCP/IP applications,
theyhad to integrate a mix of vendors' applications, while
other users have begun to sample Microsoft's own IP utilities.

Jeff Matchan, a systems support specialist for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Association, said he replaced Microsoft's Internet
Explorer with Netscape Communications Corp.'s Net-scape Commerce
Server for economic reasons. "We get [Commerce Server] free
because we are a non-profit organization," he said. "With Internet
Explorer, I'd have to buy a license for each workstation."

Matchan said he could not access a Hewlett-Packard Co. Unix
based server with LAN WorkPlace for DOS, a TCP/IP package from
Novell Inc., with Windows 95 running. Instead, he used the
Telnet application included in the Microsoft stack

Translation Feature on Its Way -- Hypercom to bundle legacy
TCP gateway into routers and FRADs

By:
AMY ROGERS

Hypercom Network Systems Inc. is bundling a protocol-translation
feature into its routers and frame-relay access devices this
month to help network managers trying to incorporate legacy
data into a TCP/IP LAN.

The feature, which is called Legacy/TCP gateway, will be bundled
into Hypercom's Integrated Enterprise Networking routers and
FRADs. The gateway interprets legacy protocols such as bisynchronous
or Systems Network Architecture in a TCP/IP format to give
users access to the Internet and other TCP/IP services.

Legacy interfaces correspond to their own TCP/IP sessions, eliminating
the need to encapsulate data in a non-native format, according
to officials at the Phoenix-based company. Thus, all legacy
based data arrives at the server as TCP/IP traffic.

"Each side sees data in its native form," said Dave Matusow,
lead SNA architect at Hypercom. "Routers take SNA data and
throw it into an IP frame and route it like any other traffic."

He said the problem with that approach is network managers may
experience TCP/IP session failures.

Legacy/TCP Gateway takes care of distributing sessions through
the enterprise to ensure that no node becomes overloaded. Consequently,
network management traffic is reduced, he said.

Legacy/TCP Gateway is already bundled into many Hypercom products.

Hypercom can be reached at 602-866-5399.

SMC Unveils Hub, Switch

By:
ERIC LACH

Standard Microsystems Corp. has announced a hub aimed at small
work groups and an Ethernet switch.

The six-port switch, called the EZswitch-6x, is designed as
a low-cost plug-and-play version of the company's TigerSwitch.
The switch provides simultaneous wire-speed Ethernet connections
on all ports, delivering 60 megabits per second of throughput
in half-duplex mode or 120 Mbps in full-duplex mode, said Jim
Colantropo, senior product marketing manager at SMC, Hauppauge,
N.Y.

The switch uses a crossbar switching matrix, which allows simultaneous
support of multiple packets across the switch. As many as six
switching paths can be established at a time, with each path
crossing two ports.

Of the six ports, five are RJ-45 10Base-T ports; one is a combination
AUI/TP/BNC 10-Mbps port.

SMC's new shared Ethernet hub, the EtherEZ Hub, comes in five
, eight- and 16-port configurations and costs about $25 per
port, said Mike Pellicone, SMC product marketing manager.

The EZswitch-6x sells for $1,199 and ships immediately. The
EtherEZ Hub, also available now, comes with five RJ-45 ports
for $125; or eight RJ-45 ports and one BNC port for $239; or
16 RJ-45 ports, one BNC and one AUI port for $499.

SMC can be reached at http://www.smc.com/ or 800-762-4968.

FCC OKs Sprint's European Plans

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

The FCC last month approved Sprint's alliance with France Telecom
and Deutsche Telekom AG, clearing the way for Sprint and its
European partners to begin offering business customers integrated
international voice- and data-communications services.

The FCC's approval of the venture eliminated the final U.S.
regulatory barrier to Sprint's plan to sell each of its European
partners a 10 percent equity stake in Sprint for a combined
total of between $3.5 billion to $4.2 billion and establish
a separate international-services joint venture.

Once established, the venture will benefit users by giving them
a single source for seamless voice and data connections between
the United States and international locations, although hurdles
remain before the three partners will be able to make their
plans a reality, users and analysts said.

Global Connectivity

"Anywhere you could get global connectivity from your local
provider would be a good thing," said Scott Cervenka, manager
of network services at Hartmarx Corp., a Chicago apparel maker.
Sprint may have some initial difficulties working with its
new partners, but "I'm sure that it's nothing that couldn't
be worked out eventually," Cervenka said.

"Sprint is doing this to bring its service portfolio up to par
with what MCI and AT&T already offer through their global partnerships,"
said Christine Heckart, director of broadband consulting at
TeleChoice Inc., a consultancy in Verona, N.J.

The Sprint venture resembles MCI Communications Corp.'s Concert
alliance with BT and AT&T's WorldPartners cooperative agreement
with a number of European and Asian carriers. It is intended
to give customers one contact for international voice and data
circuits, Heckart said.

"There is a definite market need among multinational companies
that want a single source provider of their communications
needs" to eliminate the cost of procuring and maintaining dissimilar
communications services from different providers around the
world, Heckart said.

The venture's first service offerings, expected to become available
to consumers early this year, will be integrated versions of
services already offered separately by each of the three partners,
said Stuart Mathison, assistant vice president of strategic
planning at Sprint International, Reston, Va.

The three companies have begun the integration process. They
said they plan to launch the services and announce features
and prices, as well as a name and logo for the venture, following
a Jan. 12 Sprint shareholder vote on the European partners'
equity investment in Sprint, Mathison said.

Alliance to Extend Data Services to Users

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

AT&T subsidiary AT&T Network Systems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard
Co. said they will develop software and hardware in a broad
marketing alliance that will help telephone and cable-television
providers extend broadband data services to users.

The alliance is expected to boost the capabilities of each company
to provide broadband data services and equipment to cable and
telephone companies. Products resulting from the alliance will
primarily target the consumer market, though there will be
some business applications.

According to AT&T Network Systems, the alliance is expected
to provide products for Internet access, home shopping, telecommuting,
interactive games, personal audio channel, distance learning,
interactive advertising and telemedicine in wired and wireless
environments.

The companies said they hope to develop a common network software
platform for interactive data networks, applications for that
platform, interactive television technology, network elements,
computing systems, test instruments, cable TV modems, network
management and software technologies.

Hardware, such as cable modems and high-speed network elements,
will be rolled out in the next six months, said Carly Fiorina,
president of AT&T Network Systems. In the next year, AT&T Network
Systems and HP plan to deliver head-end equipment for cable
and telephone companies that allows the two companies to manage
broadband services to business and residential customers.

"This is a very good sign. AT&T and Hewlett-Packard are legitimizing
the effort to bring broadband services to the home,'' said
Amy Reiber, a broadband consultant at TeleChoice Inc., a Verona,
N.J., consultancy.

Deal Targets Desktop Services

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

Aiming to offer more desktop communications services to a burgeoning
outsourcing market, Ameritech and IBM have teamed up to sell
each other's services to their existing customers.

Together, the companies are vying for a piece of the estimated
$33 billion global outsourcing market, especially in the areas
of integrated voice and video services and support.

"There's a lack of voice and video integration,'' said Sam Pomazano,
a vice president at IBM's subsidiary Integrated Systems Solutions
Corp. (ISSC)

"Customers need convergence help,'' said Jack Wright, president
of custom business services at Ameritech.

The two companies formed an alliance recently to market integrated
voice, video and data services, providing customers with a
single point of contact for desktop-based communications. The
seven-year agreement will first extend the outsourcing capabilities
to existing ISSC and Ameritech customers.

A selection of equipment and services will be available to telecommunications
managers through the alliance, such as PCs, software and videoconferencing
equipment and service.

IBM's ISSC subsidiary will work with Ameritech to manage Ameritech's
desktop computing and LAN requirements. Ameritech will provide
ISSC with voice and video desktop-support services for sites
throughout the country, Ameritech and ISSC officials said.

Internet Scanner Ported to Win NT

By:
Karen Rodriguez

Internet Security Systems Inc. has announced plans to ship a
version of its Internet Scanner software for systems running
Microsoft Windows NT, providing users with a tool to detect
weak security links in their Internet-connected networks.

Employing the same techniques used by hackers to penetrate large
corporate networks, ISS' Internet Scanner will detect up to
130 network vulnerabilities, including those found on PCs running
Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95.

ISS said it plans to provide in mid-1996 a version of its software
that runs on Windows NT servers. Scanner runs on major Unix
platforms and the Linux operating system, and is priced according
to the number of devices in the network. It ranges from $800
for a small network to $80,000 for 10,000 devices.

The currently shipping version 3.2 of Internet Scanner gives
network administrators more control over all local and remote
PCs. Such nodes are often the sites in a network from which
hackers gain access to corporate network resources, said Chris
Klaus, founder and CEO of ISS, Norcross, Ga.

"Our focus on Microsoft holes stems from our understanding that
the weakest link on a network is often the common PC," Klaus
said.

Scanner Specifics

Scanner is a diagnostic tool that simulates Internet hacker
attacks, similar to the highly publicized Security Administrator
Tool for Analyzing Networks software that is available free
on the Net. But, as a commercial product, Scanner is supported
and regularly updated with detections for newfound vulnerabilities.

Scanner directly tests for Internet Protocol spoofing; firewall
checks, such as source porting; and other risks to Web servers.
It also tests for mail security holes and vulnerabilities in
X-Windows, as well as access to Network File System and brute
force break-in attempts.

The tool automatically tests a network and generates a report
that can be viewed by a Web browser with links to patches and
references to Computer Emergency Response Team advisories and
other software solutions.

"We use Scanner as a diagnostic tool," said George Kurtz, data
security consultant at Price Waterhouse's Management Consulting
Group in Morristown, N.J. "It's been a real big help. It's
comprehensive and Chris Klaus is always looking for the latest
vulnerabilities and immediately building them into the product.
There is no lag time between discovery and update."

Scanner can be used in tandem with firewalls and other packet
filtering devices to ensure they are configured correctly and
remain current with the latest security measures.

"As a sanity check, administrators should be running these tools
against their firewalls for an overall security check. If there
are any holes, you can bet a hacker will find out," Kurtz said.

He added that in their zeal to connect to the Net, many companies
neglect to define a security policy or firewall implementation,
which can lead to break-ins despite efforts to put the best
security measures in place.

ISS can be reached at http:// iss.net or 404-441-2531.

build their internal distributed networks using the Internet.

"Common Ground's electronic-document technology offers more
than just document authoring and archiving tools-it provides
organizations with a highly functional platform for information
management and workplace collaboration," said Fred Sorkin,
chairman, president and CEO of Hummingbird, Toronto.

Hummingbird had licensed Common Ground's technology for inclusion
in Columbus, Hummingbird's intranet/Internet desktop suite
for PCs. Common Ground 2.0, which will be integrated into Columbus
and ship Jan. 15, includes a platform-independent, electronic
portable document technology that competes with Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Acrobat. It also contains a collaborative document-authoring
environment, intranet/World Wide Web publishing and archival
tools, and utilities that enable legacy documentation to be
converted easily to a portable electronic-document format for
enterprise-wide distribution.

Columbus is expected to cost between $150 and $300 per desktop.
Initial versions will run on Microsoft Windows 3.11 clients;
versions for Win 95 and Win NT will follow later in the year.

A personal Web server has been built into Columbus to let users
in the intranet create their own home pages, as well as an
intelligent agent that automatically collects information within
the company.

Additional technologies available include Common Ground's Web
publishing system that includes a batch-file-format converter
for moving legacy documents onto the Web.

Common Ground, Belmont,Calif., pioneered the electronic-document
technology market with the release of Common Ground 1.0 in
1993.

Hummingbird can be reached at 416-496-2200.

Ganymede Lets Its Chariot Ride

By:
RUTRELL YASIN

Network managers looking for a way to determine how their client
server applications will have an impact on network performance
should find what they are seeking with a product from Ganymede
Software Inc.

The start-up has launched Chariot, a software tool that lets
network operators simulate application data traffic on their
networks, letting them gauge the effect an application will
have on the network before deploying it.

The emergence of such technologies as frame-relay and asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) have prompted network managers to search
for tools that can handle a variety of performance- analysis
duties, the Research Triangle Park, N.C., company said. Network
managers and vendors are using a combination of products-modeling
tools, Remote Monitoring software and frame generators-to test
performance, said Steve Joyce, vice president of marketing
at Ganymede.

Beta testers said Chariot will complement their traditional
testing and analyzer tools because it gives them a way to measure
the end-to-end performance of complex networks.

Performance Evaluation

North Carolina's Microelectronics, Communications and Networking
Center, an interoperability testing lab in Research Triangle
Park, is using Chariot to evaluate the performance of its ATM
network. With its ATM infrastructure, MCNC is providing a way
for customers and vendors to evaluate high-speed networking
technology and applications.

"We're trying to see what happens to applications running in
an ATM" network that typically has voice, video and data running
across it, said Nancy Agosta, director of MCNC's Center for
Network Testing Services.

Chariot consists of an IBM OS/2-based console and end points
that reside on OS/2 or Microsoft Windows 95-based client workstations.

Chariot will be available at the end of the month. Pricing starts
at $11,000.

Ganymede can be reached at 919-558-1138.

Clientele Boosts Wares -- Help-desk features enhance suite of
automation tools

By:
BETH DAVIS

Clientele Software Inc. expanded its suite of automation tools
by adding help-desk capabilities.

The company, formerly known as AnswerSet Corp., has added Clientele
IS, a software package that builds on its flagship product,
Clientele, combining asset management and problem resolution
with Clientele's call-tracking and management capabilities,
the Tualatin, Ore., company said.

Kevin Roberts, MIS director at Clark, Klein and Beaumont plc,
a Detroit law firm, said he originally bought Clientele a year
ago "because of its flexibility and ability to be molded into
your environment.''

Because Clientele was designed to support external customers,
Roberts tweaked it to fit his internal IS department. In the
past month, however, Roberts said he has been impressed with
the new software. "I think they did a better job than I did,''
he said.

Dale Wetzelberger, operations manager for Baltimore-based Aerotech
Inc., said he chose Clientele/IS to support the approximately
1,500 employees working for the personnel and temporary placement
firm because it's easy to customize.

The software maintains a list of preferred products, services
and vendors. It also processes and tracks new equipment orders
and converts received orders to registered inventory. Assets
can be identified by pre-defined categories, such as serial
number, asset number or user.

Call-tracking features enable incoming calls to be assigned
to specific support representatives or user-defined groups,
which can represent physical location or other attributes.

Running under Microsoft Windows on a PC platform, the software
costs $3,495 and includes three concurrent user licenses, training
and one year of support and maintenance. It is available now.

Clientele Software can be reached at 503-598-4500.

Management Insight: RESOLUTIONS? BAH, HUMBUG! HERE'S AN ENTERPRISE MGM'T 
WISH LIST INSTEAD

By:
Rick Sturm

Now that the holiday season is behind us, most of us are looking
forward to the new year. It's the time to set goals and make
resolutions. I won't make my New Year's resolution here, but
I do submit a wish list for things I would like to see happen
in the world of management in 1996.

First, as many people are thinking about peace, I add a much
more modest wish. The acrimony and divisiveness that emerged
last year around the SNMPv2 issue has been appalling and incredibly
destructive. Not only have friendships been ruined, but many
other Simple Network Management Protocol-related efforts have
been stalled pending resolution of this issue, and the effectiveness
of the entire Internet Engineering Task Force standards process
has been called into question. So, the first item on my wish
list is for peace within the SNMP community.

The second item is very closely related to the first. I would
like to have a secure, effective way to control and configure
devices remotely on a network. I don't care if you call this
solution SNMPv2. All I care about is getting this ability as
soon as possible.

Next, I'd like to see the major vendors of management software
declare a moratorium on the acquisition of independent companies.
The current trend in the industry is for larger companies to
wait for someone to develop a new product and then buy it.
This approach carries far less risk than attempting to develop
something new. On the other hand, it seems a little like cheating
on an exam in school.

I would also like to see the platform vendors agree on a common
set of application progamming interfaces for their products.
This would allow third-party developers to develop and introduce
products more quickly and at a lower cost.

My fifth wish is that all of the major platform vendors participate
in the Enterprise Management Shoot-Out at the Enterprise Management
Summit. This is the one concrete way in which they can allow
users to compare their products in an objective environment.

Finally, I want people to understand better the issues of network
and systems management. First, I'd like to have the end users
understand it, so they can be more realistic in the demands
they place on operations. Second, I'd like for middle and upper
management to raise their levels of awareness so they can make
higher-quality decisions about funding network and systems
management.

I do not limit this just to users. I would like to see people
on the vendor side have a better grasp of these issues, too.

Each area is important and each of us can have an impact on
them. I plan to do all that I can in those areas and hope that
you will as well.

Institute Inc., dedicated to advancing enterprise management
through education and research. He also has been extensively
involved in network and systems planning at one of the Bell
operating companies. The opinions expressed are his own. He

Editorial: MIDDLEWARE TO BOOST APP SMARTS IN '96


There's ample evidence to support the contention that 1996 may
be the year network applications finally get some needed smarts.

And middleware will be the magic pill that's going to boost
application intelligence. Middleware is the first incarnation
of component software-the application model the industry is
slowly moving toward.

Middleware solutions will provide the glue companies will need
to design and build applications that are integral to a new
dynamic computing model.

Over the course of last year we saw such vendors as Sun, IBM
and Microsoft lay out their middleware and object strategies.

Last fall, Sun began shipping its Network Enterprise Objects.
NEO relies on Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),
the industry-standard way for objects to communicate across
the network. The NEO platform includes OpenStep, an object
oriented development environment to build clients that can
access CORBA services or CORBA objects running on the server;
and Java, which can provide a client front end for NEO/CORBA
business objects running on the server.

IBM is a member of the Object Management Group, which promises
to support CORBA with its system object model and future distributed
system object model products.

IBM has also detailed plans to integrate its own asynchronous
messaging product, MQSeries, with several of its products.

Microsoft's approach centers on Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE), which has had a desktop-centric view of the world. Network
OLE, however, which is Microsoft's version of the Open Software
Foundation's DCE RPC, is expected sometime in 1997. It will
provide distributed features to OLE.

There's also ample evidence that distributed applications will
change the way we do business. We're beginning to see a glimpse
of this in the way access to corporate networks has been affected
by the Internet.

With asynchronous, store-and-forward technologies and distributed
objects, the need for expensive, full-time server-to-server
connections has diminished and the move toward smarter applications
is a given. Increasingly, the presence of middleware on enterprise
networks is becoming the norm.

With its adoption, the structure of the network will undergo
a healthy change, one that will allow it to mirror the way
people work.

Inside Perspective: NETWORK MANAGERS FACE A CHALLENGING YEAR

By:
Chris Roeckl

Like me, many of you probably spent the past couple of weeks
cleaning up your office, preparing for the new year. After
all, the end of December seems to be the only time in the networking
business when things slow down.

You also may have spent some time contemplating what this year
will bring in terms of new products and services that will
help make designing, implementing and managing your enterprise
network and the network applications that ride on that network
easier.

Certainly, many products will be delivered. We'll play our role
in helping you find them, as well as track the trends that
affect your business.

For example, the lines separating many technologies continue
to blur. There's been talk about the convergence of networking
and computing technology for years, where industry nirvana
amounts to the networked multimedia desktop. In the past couple
of years, major progress has been made to bring these technologies
together.

Such developments necessitate that companies take a team approach
when buying technologies. No longer can a network manager be
isolated from client/server applications developers or vice
versa.

Further, technologies within the enterprise network infrastructure
itself continue to become muddled. Thus, the decision about
whom to partner with for an array of networking equipment becomes
more difficult.

Layer on top of this trend the Internet and things really start
to get confusing. The Internet is changing the way companies
think about how they conduct their businesses. And beyond the
frenzy of preparing for electronic commerce, smart companies
are realizing that the structure of the Internet is suitable
to their business models; hence, the rise of the corporate
"intranet."

The Internet also stands to turn the telecommunications market
upside down, as companies begin to view the Internet as a viable
vehicle for handling network traffic that had been the sole
domain of traditional telephone companies using private leased
lines.

This comes at a time when the telecom industry is going through
significant change. While Congress tries to break up the remaining
monopoly of the local loop, the phone companies and local regulators
are working at the state level to bring competition into the
local services market.

These are just a few of the major areas that are reshaping the
world we work in today. So, if you were expecting your job
to get a little easier in 1996, it won't. Indeed, it will probably
be more difficult than ever.

What's different from years past, though, is that corporate
management is now fully cognizant of the importance of the
enterprise network. This puts the corporate network manager
in the spotlight.

We're aware that critical decisions can make or break the career
of a corporate network manager. That's why we take our job
of helping you make the right choices so seriously.

I wish you the best of luck in 1996.

Letters to the Editor: ISDN EVERYWHERE



Your article "ISDN Links Get Coded" has shed a glimmer of hope
on our efforts to make ISDN as "easy" to use as possible [CommWeek,
Dec. 4]

We are an Internet-service provider in the process of testing
ISDN connectivity in hopes of being able to offer this service
within the first quarter of 1996.

We are going to be performing many tests on installation procedures,
equipment configuration, software configuration and the whole
process of ordering ISDN. It is our hope that the lessons learned
through this exercise will let us set up a template and guidelines
for our clients interested in Internet connectivity via ISDN.

This has not been an easy task. Fortunately, our phone company
(Nynex) has changed its ISDN division management and is now
actively supporting ISDN requests and installations in its
service area. It has been very forthcoming in helping us establish
a test platform for its service.

I am confident that with Nynex's help, we will be able to jump
the ISDN hurdle and get this service up and running.

I read with interest your story about Infonet Software Solutions

["MTA Archives Mail Messages," CommWeek, Dec. 11]

In fact, Messenger 400 is far down the power curve in its support
of archiving. Innosoft International Inc.'s PMDF message-transfer
agent has included message archiving for several years and
several of my consulting clients, including CGnet Services
and the Executive Office of the President, have used this feature
with great success. The latter, in fact, is using message archiving
specifically to support the requirements of the National Archives
and Records Administration mandate-since they were the agency
that originally brought this issue to the public eye.

Letters to the Editor: MISSING THE MARK


You have missed the point [Rash's Judgment, "The World According
to Gates: Universal Access and the Benefits of the Internet,"
CommWeek, Dec. 4]. The reason there is no detail is that up
until now, Microsoft was pursuing a proprietary (again) solution
to Internet business, the Microsoft Network. Not until they
realized they missed the mark by a long shot did the tone change
at Big Blue, er, Redmond.

Gates has been hammered lately by those who fail to bow to his
Redmondship and their "steal-anything-at-all-cost" philosophy.
Faced with an Internet marketplace where innovation is king,
Microsoft has a lot of catching up to do.

Gates impresses people with his power and money, especially
media types. Just take a look at the millions of dollars of
free publicity he got for that sophomoric fiasco called the
Windows 95 launch. The media ate that up like candy. Too bad
most of them know nothing about what Microsoft technology really
does and doesn't do.

This mail is being sent from a Windows 95 workstation. In spite
of the horsepower I have (100-megahertz Pentium), it is dog
slow. The interface is clumsy, and in no way comparable to
my other computer, my Apple Macintosh Quadra. If I had to send
you an attached document from this mail station, the non-Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extension-compliant Microsoft Mail would automatically
"un-encode" the software, forcing you to run it through a binary
converter so you could read it. I have no options to turn that
nonsense off.

Thank heaven they don't force me to go through the Microsoft
Network to get to the Internet. I would quit.

Microsoft is good at selling to the masses. I would guess they
spend more as a percentage on marketing than on research and
development. It's too bad their products are second-rate, clear
across the board.

Bill Gates is definitely not the person to lead us boldly forward.
He misguessed the Internet and is back-filling. This industry
is driven by demand and competition, not by self-appointed
pundits.

THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE NETWORK MANAGER -- As networks become
strategic corporate assets, business savvy becomes key to most
managers' success

By:
MARGIE SEMILOF

Sure, the network is still what matters most. But traditional
network managers are learning that business acumen, not technical
know-how, now holds the key to their future success.

Almost overnight, the information industry's computer fixation
has shifted from the desktop to the network. Along with this
metamorphosis comes a number of major changes for those charged
with developing the corporate computing infrastructure.

"I come from the days when Mr. Fixit was all anyone needed,"
says Anthony Iorio, director of telecommunications at ITT Corp.,
New York. "Today, my technical expertise is not as important
as knowing how to negotiate or whom to call if I need some
outside help."

Iorio's new role reflects the business changes taking place
at his company. As ITT splits into three companies this month,
Iorio's job will be transformed as well. In the past, Iorio
was responsible for hands-on development for a corporate telecommunications
network that incorporated the ITT Hartford insurance company,
the ITT Industries defense contractor and the corporate headquarters
owner of the Sheraton Hotels and Caesar's World casinos.

Wheeling and Dealing

Increasingly, Iorio is more of a deal maker, managing and negotiating
corporate contracts for the parent company. He also evaluates
new technologies before they are introduced into the corporate
architecture, and he's not alone in his new responsibilities.

As in the past, Iorio and other network managers still must
deliver 100 percent uptime, but their bigger challenge is marrying
applications to business processes when the technology itself
is a fast-moving target.

In addition, managers must explain the vast amount of technology
innovation to senior managers, who read about networking in
just about every magazine and hear about it every time they
turn on the television.

It's not easy to make a business case for, say, Lotus Notes,
when executives read that these technologies could be obliterated
by something called the World Wide Web.

Despite the upheaval, network managers are making their mark
on business. In an October 1995 study conducted by Valley Forge
Information Services, a Langhorne, Pa., market research firm,
80 out of 100 corporate network managers said they have a direct
influence on the business strategy of an organization.

The same study puts about 18 percent of network managers in
the executive tier of management in their companies.

And with the cost of failure higher than ever, change management
means balancing interest in new products and services with
the need to make firm decisions about technology directions.

"We need to be shrewd about what we choose to go with and what
is a passing fancy," says Colin Crook, senior technology officer
at Citicorp, New York.

For nearly four years, Crook has developed a global banking
network that makes increasingly intelligent devices available
to the bank's customers.

Although a rigid organizational model might be more comforting
to handle internal technology changes, the continually shifting
computer-industry landscape makes this nearly impossible. "The
World Wide Web didn't exist for us five years ago, and now
it's the hottest thing since sliced bread," Crook says.

Even though the full story of the Internet has yet to be told,
this late-blooming technology is largely responsible for showing
corporations new ways of connecting to internal users and external
customers.

Companies, such as Xerox Corp., are building Web sites as inexpensive
and easy ways to connect the company's far-flung employees
to a single, common bulletin board.

Other factors-most notably, the advent of truly distributed
computing-also are contributing to the network's ascent. And
though the actual price of technology stays about the same,
what $2,000 can deliver on a desktop keeps increasing.

"We have become indifferent to forms of computing, but we need
a network to help us put an application anywhere in the world,"
says John Hammit, a former CIO at United Technologies Corp.
in Hartford, Conn., and president of J. Hammit Group Inc.,
a Hartford consulting company.

Managers say they must nurture different skill sets compared
to what was required at the beginning of the decade. Business
planning once proceeded without technology input in most companies
but no more. Today, though network infrastructure experts may
not have moved any farther up the company flow chart, they
are deeply involved in the business-planning process.

What makes today's managers tick? Compared to five years ago,
there's added emphasis on working with multinational networks,
says Beverly Lieberman, president of Halbrecht Lieberman Associates,
a Stamford, Conn., search firm that specializes in hiring senior
information technology executives.

"This isn't just about working with others, culturally speaking,"
Lieberman says. "It's about getting work done-working with
carriers and overseas vendors." The nature of the job is more
complex than in the past.

Network managers typically have a degree or two in engineering
or computer science, but fewer than 10 percent have a master's
degree in business administration. But this may change as senior
executives demand their network staff become more business
focused-the MBA holds higher value.

Top managers are paid aggressively, Lieberman says. In a Fortune
200-size company, a top person in charge of the corporate network
infrastructure can earn $200,000 to $275,000, with a salary
bonus and stock options. Small-to-medium-size businesses will
pay about $100,000 to $150,000.

Although the network manager's position in the company hierarchy
hasn't changed much, the job has certainly ratcheted up in
importance.

"The infrastructure person is viewed as more front and center,
not back office," Lieberman says.

Though business skills are more highly prized than ever, technology
innovations over the past few years have altered the course
of career paths as well. Consider, for example, network outsourcing,
one of the biggest concepts in the 1980s that flip-flopped
in the 1990s.

A network manager five years ago would have made a buying decision
based purely on its cost benefit, choosing not to outsource,
even though vendors might have positioned it as a money-saving
measure.

Now, even if outsourcing turns out to cost more, a network manager
is just as likely to go for it.

A study conducted six years ago by Cimi Corp., a Voorhees, N.J.,
consulting company, polled 267 CIOs and found that only four
had outsourced some aspects of their information technology.
An updated survey this year revealed 121 out of the 267 CIOs
are now outsourcing.

What fuels this trend? No company will tolerate a network crash.
It was a shock to many managers when, in the mid-1980s, large
companies such as Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. handed over all
of their telecommunications management to a carrier. Now outsourcing
is commonplace.

Outsourcing keeps staff sizes small, and though it may cost
more, the network manager can hold the outside party contractually
responsible for a certain degree of performance.

Bob Galovic, managing director of information resources at the
national headquarters of the Automobile Association of America,
Heathrow, Fla., was ahead of his time on this trend. He says
that for years, he preferred Centrex service to owning a PBX.
It was worth it to offload the daily grind of running an internal
phone system to someone else.

ITT's Iorio says he outsources most of his corporation's network
management functions. And John Hodge, CIO at NAC Reinsurance
Co., a Hartford insurer, says he outsources the management
of his legacy computing systems. Hodge also has taken steps
to compartmentalize network services, so, if necessary, he
can change a carrier or buy some specialized service, such
as fax or electronic mail, without a major restructuring. "This
job becomes a management of those services," Hodge says.

To Outsource or Not to Outsource

Of course, there is outsourcing, and then there is outsourcing.
Even where managers retain network control, outsourcing can
exist within a technology, like frame-relay, saving managers
the trouble of building a private multiplexed network.

In these cases, "you are essentially letting the carrier do
the multiplexing for you," says Thomas Nolle, president of
Cimi. "The corporate network is smaller, even though service
costs go up."

Network sustainability isn't the only thing dictating the buying
habits of network managers. Network spending also solves immediate
business requirements, Nolle says. In the past, spending on
the technical infrastructure tended to be more in anticipation
of future business needs.

If senior managers want to see a return on their investments,
technologies, such as asynchronous transfer mode, will be harder
to justify, unless the senior executive has a strong knowledge
of what ATM does. Network managers must provide that expertise.

And although network managers and CIOs in traditional information
system hierarchies balance technical innovation with business
need, in some industries there's a growing shift in political
power that can't be ignored.

Rebel Armies

Workgroup knowledge workers-historically leery of central technology
organizations, which they view as tyrannical and expensive
are seizing control of their own technologies.

"Populist technology is flourishing in an unprecedented manner,"
Nolle says. "One of the little-heralded effects in the shift
toward personal computing is that first-line managers have
purchase authority over computers without needing anyone to
sign off."

Today, many end-user organizations want to buy and roll their
own applications. A CIO or network manager is often not in
a good position to set technical policy if numerous departments
in a multinational company are running their own show.

"We see the CIO as holding the coalition together," Nolle says.
"It's very Eisenhower-esque."

Local efforts are less likely to happen in industries with high
levels of transaction processing, such as retail, transportation
and utilities, says David Passmore, president of Decisys Inc.,
a Sterling, Va., consulting company.

"These companies still control networking from the top down.
Bank tellers don't aspire to be LAN managers," Passmore says.

Telecom's Role

Another consequence of the past five years is that in many companies,
the uproar over voice- and data-integration issues appears
to have subsided. Telecommunications and data communications
managers in the post-divestiture world assumed they would merge
under one collective umbrella.

But, again, the populist effect of downsizing technology makes
consolidation irrelevant in some cases. Since the evaluation
of new technology is often determined by budget, local departments
can easily afford a powerful PC that can do a number of complex
computing and networking tasks.

Carriers can sell services, such as AT&T's Network Notes, for
example, that take on the administration of Lotus Notes, or
they can buy Sprint's InfoXchange, which lets network managers
link their E-mail to a WAN without using a premises switch.
These products are a boon to local business departments, which
can-at least in theory-solve networking problems on their own
terms.

Although some product ideas have been hits, there are misses
as well. Local management of networks in many cases was more
successful than managing a network from a single console. Five
years ago, networking vendors were hawking a concept called
the "manager of managers," which included products, such as
AT&T's Accumaster Integrator, as a means of overseeing devices
throughout the enterprise.

These technologies were based on the assumption of a hierarchical
support structure that would require central management. Today,
line departments are buying LAN hubs for local activity and
managed by the department.

Some analysts and CIOs lament the fact that a decentralized
organization has less purchasing power and lacks a cohesive
plan. But there's an optimistic side to this scenario. Local
branches may spur innovation that could benefit the entire
corporation.

According to AAA's Galovic, his office sets a technical course
for 113 national clubs. But it's possible that a regional club
may choose to build something on its own.

"Our organization does not discourage a local club from doing
something different, but they need to know we have a core direction,"
Galovic says.

"If they fail at what they do, that's the risk they took. If
they succeed, maybe we have to jump on their bandwagon."

With this outlook, the network manager is surely entering a
new era.

TECHNOLOGY: WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS?

By:
Margie Semilof

Ask 10 network managers their top technology picks for the next
three years and expect to get just as many answers.

There is some agreement, however. The Internet, asynchronous
transfer mode, multimedia, computer-telephony integration (CTI)
and mobile and wireless computing top most lists. Additionally,
truly distributed, object-based computing that goes beyond
the creation of a mere client/server architecture is on their
minds, as well.

And, they say, don't write off so-called "old" technology. Five
years ago the World Wide Web held little appeal and everyone
predicted the demise of the mainframe. Now, the mainframe still
endures and technologies like the Internet are taking off.

In no particular order, here is a sampling of technologies network
managers consider their priority over the next three years.

- The Internet-more specifically, the World Wide Web. Managers
of corporate infrastructure all agree that the Internet is
important, but are not yet sure how it can help them. In the
same breath, network managers say they want quantum improvements
to network security.

- High-speed networks. These are needed to support faster, low
cost multimedia on the desktop. The convergence of voice, data
and video will be assisted by the simultaneous introduction
of high-speed networks. Anthony Iorio, director of telecommunications
at ITT Corp., New York, says CTI and multimedia are key to
providing personalized services to guests at ITT's hotel and
casino operations.

"Today, if a guest calls in to a hotel 100 times we will have
no prior information about that person," Iorio says. "Using
one basic CTI application, if that guest calls in, a screen
can pop up and we will have all we need to know about that
person: what type of room they like, what type of services
they prefer."

- Object-based systems. Object technology lets corporations
speed the time it takes to build applications and therefore
respond quickly to market changes. Network managers will continue
to distribute computing-storing information where it can do
the most good-rather than consolidating information in one
host repository.

- Mobile communications. Mobile networks will serve thousands
of sales forces and telecommuting users, as well as those at
remote sites. The Automobile Association of America, Heathrow,
Fla., says it considers mobile and wireless technology to be
the basis for developing a vehicle locator and a primary means
of member-club communications.

HE'S IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT

By:
Margie Semilof

Not long ago pundits predicted the demise of telecommunications
managers. Word was that IS shops would absorb corporate telecommunications
and those who ran the voice networks would report to computer
network gurus.

Bob Galovic disproves the theory. The Automobile Association
of America's director of information resources crossed the
boundary from manager of voice services to corporate information
systems administrator, and now he's steering the course.

Galovic is a nine-year veteran of AAA, based in Heathrow, Fla.,
with previous telecommunications management experience at Procter
& Gamble Co., Cincinnati.

The reason for his success has to do with AAA's long-held view
that telecommunications is central to its internetworking strategy.
Before Galovic was hired, the nationwide AAA had not yet tied
together its 113 member clubs-an effort that began in the late
1980s when Galovic took an active role in building LANs using
10Base-T Ethernet.

Today Galovic oversees management of all PCs, software and data
center support, including legacy systems, voice systems and
data networking. The information systems staff now numbers
70

people.

"I don't claim to be a PC guru," says Galovic, who has a degree
in mathematics. "I just need to know enough to understand it.

"In the next few years, based on the changing needs of AAA,
our next round of activity will be looking at delivering core
business products and services to external customers," he says.

Technologies such as the Internet and new call-distribution
techniques will alter the way AAA communicates with its customers,
he says. The biggest challenge does not center on any one technology,
however. Rather, it's the management of change-knowing what
technologies to adopt and what roads to bypass.

"You need to keep creativity high but still adhere to some basic
principles," Galovic says. "We want to remain cost-effective
and present ourselves as a unified organization with consistent
high-quality products."

So far, it seems, he's driving AAA down the right road.

Industry Insight: Understanding the 'Net's Business Model

By:
Don Gooding

At Venture Market East, in the shadow of Harvard University,
dozens of entrepreneurs recently had an opportunity to tell
their stories to crowds of eager but skeptical financiers.
At each presentation the same question was raised by the suit
and-tie crowd: "What's your business model?"

Now, for any self-respecting MBA, this is practically question
No. 1.

The business model is the qualitative and quantitative answer
to a set of important, basic questions: Who are your customers?
How expensive and time-consuming is customer acquisition? How
much do they pay you? What are the profit margins?

In the brave new world of the Internet, however, the answers
are not easy.

Internet business models are different from models of most existing
businesses, different this quarter from last quarter-and probably
next quarter.

For example, between Microsoft and Netscape, the traditional
desktop-software model has been trashed. Microsoft doesn't
sell desktop software-it is in the desktop-software upgrades
business, which is why Windows 95 was a seminal marketing event
for it. Netscape, too, is in the software-upgrades business,
and now is facing its first major test with Navigator 2.0.

Netscape also is in the server/client business: give away clients
to drive server sales. And Netscape, in its short life, has
moved quickly from being Internet-driven to being "intranet"
driven.

The Netscape business model is at least understandable. More
problematic for analytic types are Internet content companies.
Many entrepreneurs at the conference were in the "spaghetti
strategy" mode-throw a lot at the wall and see what sticks.
From the audience, the suits ask: "Will you get your revenue
from advertising, transaction fees, subscription fees, merchandising,
software sales, systems integration or custom development?"

Jane Webpreneur responds: "Yes."

These are not businesses that fit nicely onto a spreadsheet,
or at least a spreadsheet that converges on a single number
for internal rate of return (MBAese for investment profit)

Though content models are vexing today, the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) model was not altogether clear when we invested
in Uunet. It took a lot of experimenting and strategizing by
management and investors to reach the point where the company
could make a profit. Many ISPs are still refining their models.

All of the early Internet winners are led by management that
moves fast, is flexible, willing to experiment and can quickly
spot winning strategies and rapidly focus resources on what's
working.

Very few large companies are run on this people model. That's
why entrepreneurs will continue to dominate the Internet until
the business models settle down.

based venture-capital firm. He can be reached at DGOODING@ACCEL.COM

Xylan Moves on Fast Track

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

The local-area switching market is hot. Just look at the success
of Xylan Corp. over the past 12 months.

The Calabasas, Calif.-based company only began shipping its
switching product early in 1995. To help bring it to market,
the vendor sold 10 percent of its stock to an OEM partner,
Alcatel Data Networks, Reston, Va., in March 1995 for $10 million.

Xylan followed up that distribution deal with OEM contracts
with Networks Systems Corp., Hitachi Inc. and Digital Equipment
Corp. as well as the rapid expansion of its own operations.

The result has been explosive growth for Xylan, which reported
$14 million in sales through the first nine months of 1995
but expects to close out its books for the year with almost
$28 million in sales, said Douglas Hill, director of marketing
and a Xylan founder.

Just as important, Hill said, Xylan will be profitable for the
fourth quarter, after running in the red for the first nine
months.

A few good profitable quarters built on top of rapid revenue
growth usually precedes an initial stock offering. For its
part, Xylan reportedly is talking with several top investment
banking firms about an initial public offering sometime early
this year.

William Becklean, a securities analyst at Hanover Institutional
Securities Inc., a Boston investment firm, said Xylan can be
compared with San Jose, Calif.-based Alantec Inc., another
switch vendor, to estimate Xylan's market value. For the year
ended Dec. 31, the publicly traded Alantec is expected to have
estimated earnings of $10.5 million on revenue of $52.5 million.
The company recently had a market valuation of 8.4 times revenue.

On that basis, Xylan might command a market valuation of about
8.5 times revenue, or about $240 million, Becklean said.

Another analyst, who asked to remain anonymous, said $240 million
would be a good starting point, but Xylan would probably want
a higher valuation.

During the last round of venture capital financing, Xylan was
valued at about $200 million and the company would probably
want "to kick up'' the valuation to more than $240 million,
the analyst said.

Troops Benefit From Key Software

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

A small Pittsburgh company is supplying the U.S. Army with a
key piece of software and professional services to provide
support to American soldiers in Bosnia.

Carnegie Group Inc. has installed its Knowledge-Based Logistics
Planning Shell (KBLPS) at three U.S. Army sites in Germany
to analyze and recommend solutions for military supply problems
in Bosnia. KBLPS uses a Unix 2.4 operating system running on
Sun Microsystem Inc. Sparcstations connected primarily to Ethernet
LANs, a Carnegie spokesman said.

Carnegie, a 12-year-old systems integration and software-development
company, specializes in developing client/ser-

ver-based applications that work with existing computer systems.
Carnegie derives more than 90 percent of its revenue from providing
services. Carnegie also licenses a small amount of software,
which accounts for less than 10 percent of its revenue.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1995, revenue was up 52
percent, to $19.1 million, compared with the same nine months
in 1994, largely because of an increase in software services,
which jumped 56 percent, to $17.9 million.

Most revenue from services came from an extension on a logistics
contract with the Defense Department and a contract with U
S West Communications Inc.

Carnegie has focused on the telecommunications, financial services,
manufacturing and defense markets. Its largest customers include
U S West, BellSouth Telecommunications Inc., Ford Motor Co.,
First USA Bank and the U.S. Army.

Ford is the largest shareholder in the company. Its 560,000
shares of common stock represent 9 percent of Carnegie's stock.
U S West owns 6.5 percent; Digital Equipment Corp. owns 5.6
percent and Texas Instruments Inc. owns 5.4 percent.

In November Carnegie raised $10.6 million in its initial public
offering, consisting of 2 million shares. The company sold
1.5 million of the shares and officers and other investors
sold the remaining 500,000 shares. The offering share price
was $8.

Scopus Builds Help-Desk Operations

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

Scopus Technology Inc. has rapidly built a business of selling
software that can be used for enterprise-wide help-desk operations,
to support sales and marketing operations and to automate product
design.

Revenue more than doubled to $12 million from $5.4 million for
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with the same period
in 1994, which is close to the $15.25 million revenue Scopus
reported for all of fiscal 1994.

Scopus' product line consists of three applications packages
 SupportTeam, to handle customer support; Quality Team, for
product design; and SalesTeam, to handle marketing and sales
automation. Other modules and tools are responsible for communications,
data replication or customization of applications.

Prices of the application packages range from $12,000 to $120,000
per server and from $3,000 to $3,500 per user. Other modules
and tools are priced from $3,000 to $20,000.

Scopus, Emeryville, Calif., is developing HelpDesk for internal
help-desk applications and as an extension to SalesTeam to
handle field sales forces. Both are due out the first half
of 1996.

Scopus' products run on standard networking operating systems
and relational database management systems, except for Informix
Software Inc.'s Informix. Support for Informix will be added
early this year, a spokeswoman said.

But Scopus faces increasing competition from various vendors
and has had to call on outside systems integrators and consultants
to help it with larger projects.

Outside contractors are expensive and Scopus was unable to pass
along all the costs to its customers. Gross margins on service
and maintenance revenue fell to 7 percent from 42 percent for
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with the same period
the year before.

Overall, net income for the six months ended Sept. 30 was down
42 percent to $227,000 from the $388,000 reported in 1994.

Scopus has hired Joan Beardsley as senior director of professional
services to manage those outside contracts, a spokesman said.

Ward Off Virus Invasions -- Central House's MimeSweeper helps
isolate infected documents

By:
JEFFREY SCHWARTZ

Central House Technologies Inc. this week will unveil software
to help administrators prevent viruses from invading their
networks from the Internet and from external electronic-mail
services.

MimeSweeper scans message attachments for viruses and isolates
any E-mail with files believed to contain infected documents,
said Joe Rohde, president of Central House, Plymouth, Calif.
The company initially will ship MimeSweeper for Lotus cc:Mail
networks or any Internet E-mail system based on the Simple
Mail Transport Protocol.

Later releases of MimeSweeper will support Microsoft Corp.'s
Microsoft Mail and Novell Inc.'s GroupWise office-automation
software, according to Rohde. MimeSweeper runs on a Windows
NT server and is connected to an incoming message gateway by
scanning all attachments prior to routing E-mail within the
corporate network.

"If the message is OK it is routed to the post office, but if
it's infected the message is quarantined and the administrator
is alerted,'' Rohde said.

The software interfaces with most anti-virus scanning applications;
multiple programs can be invoked, he added.

E-mail networks are susceptible to network viruses and network
managers often hesitate to implement defensive measures in
their networks until after they are hit by a virus, said Mark
Levitt, an analyst at International Data Corp., a Framingham,
Mass., consulting company. Levitt said one drawback to using
MimeSweeper is that it does not support encrypted messages.

"If you and I use encryption, MimeSweeper will consider it a
suspect message,'' Levitt said. "Encryption is not widespread
today, but as more companies start using encryption, this could
be an issue.''

Rohde said Central House plans to support encryption in future
releases.

Available now, MimeSweeper is priced at $2,850 for the first
100 users and $650 for an additional 100 users.

Central House can be reached at 209-245-5900.

Case Ventura, Net Detective: Buyouts & Binges In the New Year



Noon was just a few minutes away when I reached my office. I
paused at the door and my eye fell upon a small brown parcel
left lying on the walk. As I bent to pick it up, I heard heels
clicking behind me on the sidewalk. Rita Telco and Belle Nomour
wheeled up to me, their faces distraught.

"You don't want to go in there.''

They were trembling like network managers with massive investments
in Vines. What's the problem, I wondered?

I already had had a lousy week. I hate New Year's because it
means I am another year older. Plus, I ate too much during
the holidays and my stomach was as shaky as Lotus' ship dates
for Notes 4.0.

There are other things on my mind. For instance, I heard that
Hewlett-Packard was finally bringing its NetServer management
tools up to snuff for OpenView. Today, a user can set performance
thresholds, but the system won't say anything is wrong unless
it is specifically asked about it. So what was the point of
having performance thresholds? The new version sends an alert
to the administrator, just as in the current Windows version.

And Oracle is expecting a mid-January release of Oracle Lite,
a database for mobile users. It will sell for only $99 and
be a preview of Oracle8 with its handling of new data types.
Oracle built this object/relational hybrid database from the
ground up.

My secretary, Lotta Memory, also said Novell will partner with
Aurora Systems to bring telephony features to Novell's GroupWise
office-automation software. It's likely that the software could
be one of the biggest hits at the Computer Telephony Expo in
March.

Aurora makes FastCall, a middleware platform used by most telecommunications
companies to bring telephony features to Windows applications.
At the same show, Applied Voice Technology, a company that
makes LAN-based messaging software, will release a slew of
unified messaging products.

Then there are the year's first buyout rumors. From the deserted
gin mills of Wall Street, Caseworkers said they overheard that
Netscape Communications wants to acquire FTP Software.

Netscape would get a TCP stack, access to some major FTP customers
and some substance to go with its $5 billion capitalization.

I suddenly realized Rita had a bottle of my favorite scotch
tucked under her arm. Belle took the brown package from my
arms.

"You won't find a buyer for Novell in there, Case.''

I put the key in the lock and turned it. My office door opened
and I was shocked at what was on my desk.

Rash's Judgement: MY EDITOR MADE ME DO IT: GUESSING WHAT'S HOT IN NETWORKING 
THIS YEAR

By:
Wayne Rash Jr.

Given the mind-boggling frenzy surrounding the Internet last
year, I'm not sure if it's safe to predict what might come
to communications in 1996. I don't think anyone foresaw the
magnitude of the Internet's impact. Yet one way or another,
it's affected nearly everything in networking.

On the other hand, one of the tasks we columnists are saddled
with by our editors is to predict the future accurately. This
being my first column of the new year, I'm discharging this
awesome responsibility as quickly as possible. Besides, that
way, by the end of the year, no one will remember whether I
was right or not.

In any case, some trends are obvious, even if some of the moves
haven't been played out yet. For example, it's pretty clear
that the entertainment industry and the information industry
are developing a real synergy. The deal between Microsoft and
NBC Television is only one example, although it's probably
one of the more spectacular.

By this time next year, you can expect to see a considerable
crossover between entertainment and the on-line world. Of course,
that's already happened, as anyone can see when television
programs start flashing Uniform Resource Locators on the screen
along with the credits. What's going to change is that much
more of the actual content will cross over, and it'll be much
more substantial material than just being able to replay David
Letterman's Top Ten list. In effect, both Cyberspace and television
will become adjuncts of the other, meaning that people will
have to access both to get the full range of information from
either.

This merging will continue in other areas as well, but not all
of them will be positive. For example, cable-television companies
will start making a real push to provide access and bandwidth
to the Internet. Ask yourself, though, if you're willing to
wait for long, undefined periods of time for the cable-repair
technician to arrive when your Internet connection is down.
I know that if I had to depend on the companies here in the
Washington, D.C., area to provide access, I'd probably never
get on the Internet again.

If the company you work for still doesn't have Internet access,
expect that to change. The existence of the vast quantity of
information to be found on the Net will create its own demand.
Many companies will find that such access is a competitive
necessity. Being cut off from this rapidly swelling pool of
knowledge will be like doing without a stock wire or a business
news service. You can do it only in industries where information
and timeliness don't matter. Outside of the government, I can't
think of any.

Network managers will also be expected to contribute to this
rising tide of content. For example, if you run the network
at your company, you can expect to be asked to start supporting
a server on the World Wide Web if you don't already. If you
have that job now, you can expect it to get bigger, bringing
along a new level of involvement to staffers working with everything
from router maintenance to security firewalls.

Because of these pressures, few network managers will be in
a position to resist the demands for greater connectivity.
And those network managers who find ways to manage this connectivity
effectively will find their positions growing in importance.
Many of those managers will be having a very good year, indeed,
by the time 1997 gets here. Many of their suppliers-everyone
from Internet service providers to on-line security specialists
will have a very good year, as well.

Now, just promise me you won't go back and read this next January
and tell me how short- sighted I was. Remember, my editors
made me do it.

U.K., U.S. SLASH ACCOUNTING RATES -- Resale Era
Begins

    By DENIS GILHOOLY

         LONDON

   The economic tide has turned.

   Experts may quibble over what precipitated the change in pricing
international telecommunications services, but there is no turning back.

      The recommendation by the U.K. Office of Telecommunications to allow
simple resale of capacity on international circuits lays the groundwork for a
new bilateral agreement on international resale between the United States and
the United Kingdom, as well as for a web of such agreements between
countries.

   Resale promises to unleash a wave of price competition and choice in
international telecoms.

   Already, resale is exerting downward pressure on the accounting-rate
system by which countries divide their income from international services.

   In August, the decision to open the resale market between Canada and the
United States was followed by an almost halving of the agreed accounting
rate.

   And earlier this month AT&T and MCI Communications Corp. filed with the
Federal Communications Commission for substantial accounting-rate
reductions over the next three years with British Telecom and Mercury
Communications Ltd.

   Inevitably, the trend towardtotal market liberalization across the Atlantic
is exposing the worst distortions in Europe.

   Analysis to be released later this year by the European Commission
documents the disarray of intra-European tariffs.

   In what the Commission terms the ``frontier effect,'' users are forced
to pay, on average, two-and-a-half times more for an international call
than for an equivalent domestic long distance call.

   After conducting its own study, the Commission's competition
directorate decided further action is necessary. Directorate commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan said he will launch an investigation of international telecoms
pricing across Europe.

France Blazes Data Net Trail

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         TOULOUSE, FRANCE-France Telecom is building a series of
high-speed, fiber optic networks that will provide data communications to
specific industries and other communities in France.

   Having proven this custom-designed network concept with a backbone
linking research organizations in Sophia Antipolis, the operator is expected
to open its second such network this month, in Toulouse.

   This network will serve Toulouse's sizable scientific and aerospace
industries.

   France Telecom will also soon build a network for the medical community in
one French city and is looking to provide networks among banks and other
commercial enterprises.

   The networks will deploy compatible but not necessarily identical broadband
technology.

   The networks in Toulouse and Sophia Antipolis are likely to progress to the
fiber distributed data interface local area network standard, for example, but
the operator has not ruled out using metropolitan area networking technology
for subsequent networks.

   Francois Croisille, a France Telecom custom design manager, said the
operator may install between 15 and 20 such networks by 1992.

   The Toulouse network will be built with a fiber backbone and link eight
organizations' computer centers and LANs, initially at speeds of up
to 2 megabits per second. The second phase of the project will increase speeds
to 34 mbps.

   Georges Sans, divisional manager for networks at Centre National
d'Etudes Spatial, a user of the Toulouse network, said similar
networks are planned near Paris-to link France's Atomic Energy
Commission and the National Institute for Information Research-and in
Marseille and Grenoble, all next year.

SWIFT Sets New Agenda

    By DAWN HAYES

         oBERLIN-SWIFT, the networking cooperative of 2,000 banks
worldwide, will begin moving into new competitive service sectors this week as
it claims a contract to network an emerging European foreign exchange
system.

   The contract is expected to be awarded by the Exchange Clearing House
Organization, a group of 25 European banks building a common clearing house
for European foreign exchange, SWIFT officials said.

   ECHO would establish the first multilateral foreignexchange settlement
system in the world, in 1992. The networked computer system would
substantially reduce banks' administrative costs by replacing the
bilateral arrangements through which they now settle foreign-exchange
transactions.

   But the ECHO contract represents just one facet of SWIFT's broad
mandate to generate new services to thwart mounting competition.

   At their annual conference this month in Berlin, SWIFT officials also said
they hope to draw the corporate customers of the society's bank
members onto the SWIFT network, which would boost traffic.

   SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications,
also intends to move into the market for managed data network services.

   And a recent decision by SWIFT to use the EDIFACT standard for electronic
data interchange is key to its entry into a broader range of value-added
network services, according to David Birch, director of marketing at Hyperion
Systems Ltd., a Guildford, England, consultancy.

   With increasing competition in the financial services market, growth in
message volumes for SWIFT slowed in 1989 to 15 percent, from an average of up
to 20 percent in the previous five years.

   And signs indicate that growth will continue to slip unless SWIFT harnesses
a new competitive direction in the 1990s, a banking source said.

    ``Innovation may not pay,'' said SWIFT chief executive Bessel Kok,
``but non-innovation may lead to loss of markets.''

   The ECHO project, along with others SWIFT is considering, will take the
17-year-old not-for-profit organization beyond its core
business of interbank transfers for payments and statements transfers and into
a new commercial environment.

Alcatel Hits Back -- Italian Merger To Counter
AT&T

    By ANNE-MARIE ROUSSEL

         MILAN-A merger of Alcatel's Italian subsidiary with
the telecoms unit of Italy's Fiat SpA would hit AT&T in
the European markets where it is making the most headway: Italy and
Spain.

   The deal, disclosed this month, calls for Alcatel-Face to merge with
Telettra SpA.

   It is ``a direct answer to everything that AT&T has done in Europe for
the past two years,'' said Didier Pouillot, an analyst with French
research house Idate.

   By entering Italy through such a powerful player as Telettra, which has 33
percent of the local transmission equipment market, Alcatel appears to be
responding to last year's deal between AT&T and Italian
manufacturer Italtel SpA.

   In addition, Alcatel will inherit Telettra's 45 percent share of
the transmission equipment market in Spain-another country AT&T
is starting to penetrate, through the sale of public switches. Just last
month, the U.S. manufacturer opened a new switching plant near Madrid.

   On a more global level, Alcatel is now in a position to overtake AT&T
as the world's largest telecoms equipment manufacturer. As Pouillot noted,
Alcatel's 15 percent annual growth rate is well above that of AT&T's
equipment business, which is close to zero.

    ``I expect that Alcatel will be ahead of AT&T by the end of 1990,''
Pouillot said.

OPTIMISM TEMPERED

   But such anticipated results are tempered by the potential of a political
backlash in Italy. The Alcatel-Telettra deal has dashed the hopes of
state-run industrial group IRI, the holding company for Italtel. IRI had
long been negotiating to merge Telettra with Italtel into an entity to be
called Telit.

   The agreement between Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, Alcatel's
parent company, and Fiat has prompted sour comments from IRI president
Franco Nobili. ``This agreement will make it more difficult to form
national industrial poles [in Italy],'' he was quoted in the Italian
press.

   Italy, which in 1988 embarked on a five-year, $43.5 billion
program to upgrade the country's telecoms infrastructure, was
expected to award Telettra about one-third of the transmission equipment
contracts.

   But the Italian government could decide to pull back, following the same
route the United States took recently when France's Groupe Bull SA
bought the computer operations of Illinois-based Zenith Electronics Corp.
Following the purchase, the U.S. government decided to renegotiate all its
contracts with Zenith.

   The new Alcatel-Telettra entity-to be based in Milan and owned 75
percent by Alcatel, 25 percent by Fiat-is to be formed by the end of next
month.

   With the addition of Telettra, Alcatel must now expand into developing
areas, particularly mobile communications, said Christopher Thomas, an analyst
with London's Systems Dynamics Ltd.

   Telettra's transmission specialty includes mobile communications
systems. It supplied Italian operator SIP with a 900-megahertz analog
system, and has contracts to supply part of the network infrastructure for
trials of the Italian, Spanish, Swiss and U.K. links of the planned GSM
pan-European digital cellular system.

SOME FIBER SYSTEMS TO BE COMBINED -- Asian Cables
Plotted

    By ROBERT POE

         SINGAPORE-Network operators from 12 countries have signed
agreements on construction and maintenance of the first three links of the
planned ASEAN optical fiber cable system.

   An official also revealed that parts of the system will be combined with
other cables planned for the Asia-Pacific region, to improve connectivity
and save costs.

   The US $320 million system, planned to link the six members of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) by 1995, will connect with
other systems to provide fully fiber optic undersea routes to both Europe and
North America.

   Besides those from the ASEAN nations of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Singapore, carriers from Australia, Canada, Japan, South
Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the ASEAN
system agreements.

   Singapore Telecom president and chief executive officer Wong Hung Khim said
the first link covered by the agreements, connecting Kuantan and Kota Kinabalu
in different parts of Malaysia, is due to be completed in December. A link
between Brunei and Singapore is to begin service late next year. The cable
connecting Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines will be commissioned in the
first quarter of 1992, Wong said.

   In addition, he said, the Malaysia-Singapore link of the ASEAN system
will be part of the recently integrated Aspac-Kyutai system
(CommunicationsWeek International, 3 September). Aspac-Kyutai,
now called APC, will link Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and two
points in Japan starting in mid-1993.

   The Indonesia-Singapore 2 link of the ASEAN system will be part of the
SEA-ME-WE 2 cable planned to connect Southeast Asia, the Middle East
and Europe. A Malaysia-Thailand cable will complete the system.

Shakeup At ETSI -- Users Lose Important Voice In
Standards

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

   SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS, FRANCE-Users appear to have lost the chairmanship of
a key technical committee at the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute-a development that could have broad implications for user
involvement in the European standards-making process.

   At press time it appeared that Business Telecommunications Committee
Chairman Jan Thurmer would be replaced by either Benoit Gasztowtt from
France's Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications or by Bjorn Hansen
from the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. Gasztowtt was supported
by Alcatel, Siemens AG and other manufacturers; Hansen, by public network
operators and L.M. Ericsson.

   The Business Telecommunications Committee is charged with formulating
standards for private and public networks and attached terminal equipment.

   ETSI Technical Committee Director Stephen Temple asked Thurmer to resign
his position and instead head a new brainstorming group that will look at how
to get users more involved in ETSI activities.

   The immediate result of his new job, however, is that users are losing
direct involvement in standards.

   Thurmer, the network manager at Nordsk Hydro AS, an Oslo-based
chemical, oil and retailing group, was the only user chosen to head one of
ETSI's 12 standards committees. Representatives from telecoms
administrations or manufacturers run the other 11 ETSI technical
committees.

   Manufacturer officials questioned whether users belong in the chair
position.

   ``A user is not interested in what is inside a machine, he is
interested in what it can do,'' said Gerard Robin, who is
responsible for Alcatel's standards activities worldwide and vice
chairman of ETSI's adhoc group on rules of procedure.

   Robin said PBX manufacturers have supported their own candidate not
because they want to promote a particular solution but because ``we don't
want to again go through the pains of having a chairman who is not in a
position to understand all the problems.''

   He said a good compromise solution would be to appoint a user as vice
chairman.

ETSI EVOLUTION

   ETSI, created in 1988, took over some of the work from the Conference of
European Postal and Telecommunications administration (CEPT). Until
ETSI was formed, users and manufacturers did not have decision-making
power on standards, which were usually decided on in secret by
administrations.

   A user serves as vice president of ETSI's general assembly, but
since the organization still remains heavily dominated by CEPT it was also
considered important to have direct user influence on technical questions.

   As in other ETSI committees, the Business Telecommunications Committee
comprises manufacturers and operators often favoring divergent approaches to
critical networking questions.

   When ETSI selects the new chairman of the committee, ``I hope the
person who will get the job will try to be objective and concentrate on the
technical job and not be steered by the administration or company he works
for,'' Thurmer said.

   Thurmer was nominated as a candidate for the Business Telecommunications
chairmanship by the International Telecommunications Users Group and has held
the position since May 1989.

   But his travel expenses between Norway and France and the time required by
the ETSI chairmanship put a strain on his company, he said.

   INTUG proposed another candidate, the network manager of a major Dutch
corporation. That candidate's company is reportedly prepared to bear
the expenses involved.

RULES MAY FACILITATE PRIVATE NETS -- Germany
Reregulating

    By JOHN BLAU AND KAREN LYNCH

         BONN-Deutsche Bundespost minister Christian Schwarz-Schilling has
drafted new regulations that could ease the establishment of private
networks and competitive services in Germany.

   The regulations, to go into effect in July, would implement the policy
initiatives included in the German telecommunications reform law of last
year.

   While the law called for competition in all but basic telephone service,
users and potential competitors have continued to complain that Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom, the German operator, has been blocking competition and
refusing to bring its tariffs in line with costs.

   DBP Telekom was given two years from the signing of the reform bill to
adjust its commercial terms to the new competitive market. But industry
sources say Telekom has not been moving fast enough in this direction.

   Now, Schwarz-Schilling has asked industry and users to comment on a
broad range of regulatory proposals. The draft includes such competitive
conditions as a guarantee that all private operators would be assured the same
tariffs and conditions as DBP Telekom when leasing lines for value-added
network services.

   Schwarz-Schilling also proposes a removal of the limitations on voice
channeling and voice compression over data lines and a narrower definition of
the network monopoly in terms of transmission and network termination, making
many of the interfaces, such as X.21, competitive.

   In a separate development, he also launched a debate to define which
mandatory services DBP Telekom must provide ``in the public
interest, particularly on account of its obligation to make services and
facilities available to the general public.''

   At issue is whether DBP Telekom would be obliged to continue to provide
services that are unprofitable.

   Related issues include the means by which Telekom would be allowed to cover
the costs of unprofitable services, and the possible sharing of those costs by
competitors.

   Schwarz-Schilling is circulating a list of questions, seeking comment
from national and international sources by mid-November.

   While the debate now focuses on such services as telex and telegram,
Schwarz-Schilling's questions pave the way for a larger debate
on the obligation to provide telecoms services nationwide under uniform terms
and conditions, rather than provide such services only where they are
profitable.

   Among his questions:

   o What should be the criteria for deciding whether a new service is of
an infrastructural nature, and thus has to be declared a mandatory
service?

   o What service features should be included in the regulation of
mandatory services (for example, nationwide coverage, uniform tariffs
throughout the service area, quality, compatible standards and
rates)?

   o What should happen to services that do not cover costs?

OSI MAY NEVER OVERSHADOW SNA -- Is IBM
Committed?

    By MALCOLM LAWS

         LA GAUDE, FRANCE

   IBM's facility in La Gaude is one of only two
manufacturer-owned laboratories in Europe approved for testing whether
products conform to Open Systems Interconnection standards. Similar labs are
typically run by specialist, independent organizations.

   IBM suggests the facility shows its commitment to open systems, not just
its own Systems Network Architecture. But the company's position on
standards remains ambiguous, despite its recently stated commitment to
improved OSI support.

   Opinions vary.

   Laurent Halphen, secretary of SHARE, a European group of 506 IBM users,
said at the organization's biannual conference in Paris last month
that it is significant that IBM now starts its announcements with talk of open
systems, evidence that it is listening to its customers.

   But Peter Rigg, managing consultant at Logica plc, in London, said
``OSI still comes second and quite a long way behind
SNA.''

   Once reluctant to embrace standards, IBM has had to change its stance in
the face of customer demand for open networks. Yet critics say that despite
the greater prominence IBM gives to open systems, its proprietary systems come
first. They say that until big IBM users demand OSI-a prospect some years
away-it will remain in the background. It does not help that IBM has not
produced list prices for its OSI products.

   IBM promises to offer wide-ranging support, not just for OSI and SNA,
but also for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, widely seen as a
practical interim step toward OSI.

   Before long, IBM could well earn much of its money building networks that
link its own computers with those from rivals like Digital Equipment Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co., using OSI protocols as well as SNA and TCP/IP.

IBM'S OSI BATCH

   Last month, IBM ushered in a new batch of OSI products
(CommunicationsWeek International, 1 October). They are designed,
for the first time, to run across all IBM's strategic Systems
Application Architecture operating systems: MVS and VM on mainframes;
OS/400; and OS/2 Extended Edition on the Personal System/2 workstation. Some
of the OSI programs are available now, while the rest will be phased in over
the next 12 months.

   SHARE's Halphen said the September announcements ``addressed the
greater part of what we asked for'' in OSI products.

   IBM has replaced its original Open Systems Network Support and Open
Systems Transport and Session Support programs with its new
OSI/Communications Subsystem. Over this runs the X.400 Open Network
Distributed System-with gateways into the Professional Office System
(Profs) and Distributed Office Support System (Disoss) and OSI File
Services, an implementation of the OSI File Transfer Access and Management
standard.

   Where previously IBM's OSI programs could access only X.25 wide
area packet switching networks, the new OSI range will also have routes across
integrated services digital networks and standard token-ring, Ethernet,
token bus and fiber distributed data interface LANs.

   But IBM is not a convert to standards as a cure for all computing ills.
Some manufacturers are moving to drop their own data communications
architectures in favor of OSI, and others, notably DEC, say they will give
equal prominence to standard and proprietary architectures. IBM has
consistently argued that it does not make sense to drop SNA, which remains,
the company says, the best way to link IBM systems.

    Jeff Hosier, a director of Xephon Ltd., a Newbury, England,
consultancy that specializes in IBM, said ``any IBM user would be off his
trolley to get too deep into OSI,'' because SNA is so much richer and
readily available.

OSI RELUCTANCE

   All IBM mainframe OSI programs run on the Virtual Telecommunications Access
Method, the main SNA software subsystem that controls session and resource
management across the network, for wide area communications. No native OSI
implementations are possible for remote links between IBM mainframe operating
systems, at least as far as IBM is concerned.

   Logica's Rigg said that although it is possible to bypass VTAM, it is
not worth the effort. VTAM is a stable, widely understood and
sophisticated system, he said, although it is expensive and can slow down
sessions where it has to process OSI protocols. ``VTAM offers a consistent
programming interface and it is the last SNA component I would encourage
users to move away from,'' Rigg said.

   Direct connection of IBM computers to LANs is through the 3172
communications controller. Again, remote mainframe sessions must go via VTAM
and IBM's Network Control Program's Packet Switching
Interface for X.25, or the 7820 ISDN adapter.

   John Westgate, an independent consultant who advises the U.K. Department of
Industry and edits a guide to OSI products, said he is impressed with
IBM's open systems efforts. And because governments have so much
buying power, when it comes to open systems especially, what IBM does to
please them is important-not just for itself, but for supporters of the
open systems cause.

   But continued differences from one country to another in the way OSI is
implemented also means that IBM can justify its continued support for SNA.
Xephon's Hosier said SNA, as a communications standard, ``is as strong as,
if not stronger than, OSI''-a point IBM is unlikely to contest.

Foreign Carriers Vie For Teleport

    Foreign telecoms carriers have been vying for entry into the North
American carrier market by seeking a stake in Merrill Lynch &
Co.'s Teleport Communications Group, based in Staten Island, New
York.

   The group, which operates metropolitan area networks in New York and other
U.S. cities, has been rumored to be up for sale for several months.

   Sources close to the negotiations say Japan's Kokusai Denshin
Denwa, France Telecom, British Telecom and Cable & Wireless plc have
all met with Merrill Lynch in an effort to work out a deal.

   Most, however, have balked at Merrill's asking price, said to be
in the $175 million to $200 million range.

Hong Kong's CT2 Plans, Bidders

    Hong Kong Postmaster General Dominic Wong said he expects to select
three or four of the six consortia that bid to operate CT2 service in the
territory. But on 28 September, the deadline for submitting bids, Wong
said he hoped for ``imaginative'' proposals and that he is open to
persuasion.

   Most of the bids were from consortia with significant overseas
participation. Most planned to spend HK $300 million to HK $400 million
(US $38 million to US $51 million) on infrastructure over five years.

   Hong Kong Telecom CSL, the value-added services arm of Hong Kong
Telecommunicatons Ltd., teamed with Star Paging (Holdings) Ltd. and SHK
Industries Ltd., a company backed by the territory's leading property
developers. Hutchison Telecommunicatons Ltd. subsidiary Hutchison Paging
bid jointly with Motorola Inc. and Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. A
group called Personal Communications Ltd. is backed by locally listed
First Pacific Co. (with a 50 percent interest in one of the territory's
three cellular operators), British Telecom, paging company ABC
Communications and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.

   Meta Communications combines interests controlled by local entrepreneur
Dickson Poon with Beijing-owned China Resources (Holdings)
Ltd., Onwel Strategic Holdings and BellSouth Enterprises Inc. Chevalier
(OA) International Ltd., a local conglomerate, formed a joint
venture with OTC International of Australia. Singapore Telecom International
Pte. Ltd., in partnership with Steamers Telecommunications Ltd., also of
Singapore, formed a Hong Kong joint-venture company called Halkis Ltd. to
pursue a CT2 license.

    A seventh submission, made by GEC-Plessey Telecommunications Ltd.,
was not an application but a series of observations on the application of CT2
in Hong Kong.

Fujitsu's Euro-Focus

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         STOCKLEY PARK, ENGLAND-Fujitsu Ltd. is putting Europe at the
forefront of its telecommunications strategy, forming its first European
telecoms research and development center to participate more in local
standards-setting and equipment development.

   Fiber optics and mobile telephony will be the Japanese manufacturer's
two main research focuses in Europe, said Sir Brian Tovey, chairman of
Fujitsu Europe Telecom R&D Centre Ltd. The creation of FTRC, in Stockley
Park, allows Fujitsu to ``build its telecoms strategy on a European
base,'' he said.

   In the area of standards-making, Fujitsu will apply to join the
European Telecommunications Standards Institute. It will likely be
accepted so long as it shows a ``legitimate interest in European
telecommunications,'' said Frede Ask, deputy director of ETSI. He said
Japanese suppliers NEC Corp. and Panasonic are already ETSI members.

   FTRC, Fujitsu's seventh European subsidiary, will also develop
for the European market equipment based on the international Synchronous
Digital Hierarchy standard. SDH, also known as Synchronous Digital Network, or
Sonet, allows multiplexed data transmission over digital networks for local
access systems.

   Specifically, Fujitsu plans to develop its Fiber Loop Multiplexers, which
it now sells in Japan and the United States, for sale to large European
network operators, said Akira Miyata, general manager of the
company's overseas transmission systems division. ``We are
very confident [of supplying SDH] if we can compete equally with
local suppliers,'' Miyata said.

   British Telecom, which recently pulled back on its strategy for
purchasing flexible access systems-an alternative to SDH-will be Fujitsu's
first target customer, Miyata said. Fujitsu's European drive into telecoms
coincides with its pending purchase of International Computers Ltd. from
STC plc-which itself was to have been BT's supplier of flexible access
equipment.

   Fujitsu chairman Takuma Yamamoto, in a recent interview, said the Japanese
company will likely expand in Europe through partnerships with locally based
manufacturers.

   Fujitsu is already active in Europen telecoms. Its contract to supply
undersea optical cables for a 500-kilometer link between England and
Germany, due to be completed in July, marked the first such success in Europe
by a Japanese manufacturer. Fujitsu also supplies transmission systems, and
makes facsimile machines and modems in Malaga, Spain, where it will also
produce small PBXs beginning next year.

   Fujitsu spent $375,000 to set up FTRC. It plans to recruit up to 30
researchers in the center's first year of operation, which begins
later this month.

   Fujitsu has no plans to set up telecoms manufacturing facilities in the
United Kingdom, said FTRC director Hachihei Kurematsu.

CEPT Begets ECTRA

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

         LONDON-A new group representing telecoms regulatory authorities
from 31 countries is making European policy on licensing procedures for
value-added services, international accounting principles and satellite
and mobile communications its top priorities.

   The European Committee on Regulatory Affairs (ECTRA), a group created
as part of the radical structural reform of the Conference of European
Postal and Telecommunications administrations, formally set its working
agenda for the next two years during an extraordinary meeting in London
late last month.

   ECTRA was created under the reorganization of CEPT, which includes the
separation of operational and regulatory functions (CommunicationsWeek
International, 12 March).

   The idea is for ECTRA to be staffed by independent government
representatives. However, the majority of Europe's public network
operators have yet to separate their own regulatory and operational
functions.

   In the meantime, most of ECTRA's staff members are being drawn from
national telecommunications ministries, with some ``wearing two hats,''
said committee chairman John Rietbroek, who is director of policy affairs
and deputy head of the department of telecommunications and post at the
Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works.

ECTRA's new working agenda includes:

   o drafting proposals for common harmonized licensing and declaration
procedures for private value-added network service operators before the
end of 1991;

   o studying whether European regulators could propose changes in the
accounting principles or international telephone calls set by the
International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee;

   o evaluating the role of regulators in European equipment testing and
certification;

   o participating in the consultation process that will follow the
release of the European Commission's draft Blue Paper on satellites;
and

   o harmonizing mobile communications regulatory policy across
Europe.

Germany Postponing Telepoint

    The Deutsche Bundespost has postponed until next year its issue of private
telepoint licenses.

   Wolf-Joachim Zeidel, director of mobile communications licensing at
the Bundespost, said that licensing procedures for paging and trunked radio
communications must be completed before introducing telepoint.

   Telepoint, a cordless personal communications technology, lets users make
calls outside their homes to base stations located in busy public places.
Users near these stations are then linked to the public network.

    DBP Telekom is conducting telepoint field trials to test the CT2 and
CT1-plus cordless telephone systems. A third trial, for a combination of
the technologies, was cancelled ``for scheduling reasons.'' It is thought
the incompatible analog CT1-plus system has little chance of being picked
following DBP Telekom's decision to sign the memorandum of understanding
on the CT2 common air interface.

trading of large blocks of stock and ``program trading''-using computers
to buy baskets of stocks-complicate the volatility.

The Underside Of French `Reform'

    A draft of France's new telecommunications ``reform'' contains
potential stumbling blocks for service providers.

   The draft, which the French Parliament is due to review this week, is
supposed to open the markets for X.25 packet switching and ISDN services to
competition by 1993. However, it proposes that tariff restraints be placed on
competitors. It also says value-added services providers competing with
France Telecom should ``make a contribution to education, training
and research'' and raises the possiblity of access charges
for interconnection to the public network.

    Another provision says the amount of capital held in French VANS providers
by a non-European Community investor cannot exceed 20 percent unless an
international treaty or agreement exists to allow it.

Argentine Network Deal Falls Apart

    By DAVID ROCKS

         BUENOS AIRES-After months of bickering and negotiating,
Argentina's government finds itself in exactly the same place it started:
operating one of the world's worst phone companies.

   The country's Empresa Nacional de Telecommunications
(ENTel) was to be split into two zones and handed over on 8 October
to private operating groups headed by Spain's Telefonica and Bell
Atlantic Corp.

   But Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corp., the U.S. bank that spearheaded Bell
Atlantic's bid, did not come up with the financing by the Argentine
government's 4 October deadline.

   So when the deadline arrived, the government forbade Bell Atlantic and
Manufacturers Hanover from taking control of the northern zone. Telefonica
then declined to assume management of the southern portion until northern
ownership is clarified.

   The government has given a group headed by Italian telecoms holding company
STET and France Telecom unit France Cables et Radio a chance to run ENTel
north in place of Bell Atlantic.

   The European group, which includes Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., has until 1
November to come up with financing and an operating plan.

   The privatization of ENTel, a company perhaps best known for its poor
service, is a key to President Carlos Menem's economic plan. The two
portions were to have fetched a total of $214 million in cash and more
than $5 billion in debt.

   The Bell Atlantic consortium was to have presented the Argentine government
with $100 million in cash and Argentine debt paper worth some
$2.3 billion for a 60 percent stake in the northern zone.

   But the bid started falling apart in September, when Manufacturers Hanover
could not line up enough bank support, U.S. bankers in Argentina said.

   Carlos Agote, head of Manufacturers Hanover's Argentine
operations, and Bell Atlantic International president C. Hyde Tucker said they
remained hopeful that the Bell Atlantic group could be allowed back in.

   Joe Goldman contributed to this story.

Shinto Sentenced

    By Robert Poe

         TOKYO-Hisashi Shinto, the 80-year-old former chairman
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., was convicted last week of bribery in
the insider-trading scandal that deposed a number of Japanese
politicians.

   He was given a two-year suspended sentence and fined about
$175,000.

   Shinto was arrested in March 1989 and charged with accepting
low-priced stock of a subsidiary of information and publishing
conglomerate Recruit Co. before it was released for public sale. He then
resold the stock at a profit. In return, Recruit received favors from NTT that
benefited its leased-line resale business.

   Although most of Japan's leading politicians at the time had
similar dealings with Recruit, which eventually ruined their careers, none
were arrested. Observers said Shinto served as a scapegoat.

   The scandal forced Shinto to resign in December 1988, several months before
his arrest. NTT president Haruo Yamaguchi, Shinto's hand-picked
successor, had to take over sooner than expected.

COMMISSION LAUNCHES COMPETITION INQUIRY -- Tariff
Liberalization On Move

    By DENIS GILHOOLY

         LONDON

   Reform of the pricing structure for international telecommunications
services has taken on a momentum of its own.

   The proliferation of transoceanic fiber optic cables and growth rates of 15
percent to 20 percent a year in cross-border traffic have driven the
industry toward new regulatory arrangements on tariffs, accounting rates and
leased circuits far quicker than expected.

   The ground rules are being rewritten daily and the old order, under which
cooperative agreements were conducted within an exclusive club of monopoly
operators, is under siege.

   The proposed cuts in the accounting rate between the United States and
United Kingdom, for example, mark a major break with tradition by involving
four separate international carriers and two national regulatory agencies.

   The present accounting-rate structure was sharply criticized last year
by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
which charged it inhibits the growth of information services and restricts
international trade (CommunicationsWeek International, 27 November
1989).

   The OECD found no stable relationship over time between the accounting rate
(a negotiated sum split between the two carriers for each international
call), the prices charged to the customer, and the costs of providing the
service.

   A lack of transparency in accounting procedures and artificially high
rates, the OECD said, gives little incentive to lower tariffs.

EXTRA-TERRITORIAL

   In addition, it penalizes high traffic volume, growth in international
traffic, and low-cost operators, the organization said. As a result,
AT&T, for example, is running a trade deficit of more than $2
billion on its international telephone business, effectively subsidizing its
rival carriers. In 1988, the U.S. deficit with Mexico was $410 million;
$153 million with West Germany.

    The chronic U.S. deficit prompted the Federal Communications Commission to
issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Regulation of International
Accounting Rates in August. The deadline for reply comments was Friday, and
though these may influence the final outcome, the FCC's stated
position remains controversial.

   The ``reform'' package is designed to slice $1 billion of the deficit,
leading to cuts in U.S. international calling prices by perhaps as much as
50 percent.

   The FCC asserts that, under the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, it has
``broad authority to regulate international telecoms services,
including international accounting rates.'' This posture
has led to charges of extra-territoriality.

   Critics argue that by dictating accounting rates, the FCC would not only
encroach on commercial decisions of telephone operators, but also be putting
unacceptable pressure on foreign countries.

   ``We might test the powers of the Communications Act,'' said FCC
Chairman Alfred Sikes. ``This has not been done before, but the FCC
intends to act aggressively in the area of accounting rates.''

   Sikes said a major factor in ``undermining fictitious accounting
rates'' would be to open the market for international simple resale of
telecoms services on a bilateral basis.

   In March, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications
Commission liberalized resale and shared use of private-line services.
This meant that foreign callers using international private lines can access
the U.S. domestic telephone network and pay only the U.S. domestic rate plus
the cost of the international private line.

   AT&T subsequently complained to the FCC that this arrangement
undermined the entire accounting-rate system, permitted foreign carriers
to avoid settlement payments, and could result in one-way bypass.

   In late August, the Canadian authorities agreed to allow the
arrangement northbound as well as southbound. They also negotiated a
significantly lower accounting rate on all ``reduced'' and ``standard''
voice traffic between the two countries.

NO COINCIDENCE

   Moves by U.K. and U.S. carriers to negotiate a new international
accounting rate coincide with a recent recommendation by Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director general of the U.K. Office of Telecommunications. He
proposed that international simple resale of telecoms services be
permitted with countries that also allow it for calls to and from the
United Kingdom.

   Carsberg intends resale to be one way of stimulating more competition on
international calls. The other will be by capping British Telecom's
rates for international calls and its charges for international private
circuits. Both international resale and price capping will be considered as
part of the United Kingdom's forthcoming duopoly review.

   Simple resale involves the hiring of a private circuit from a telephone
company and using it to set up a competing service.

   ``Resale has been on the cards for years,'' said Iain Vallance,
chairman of BT. ``The worry would be if it was not done on a reciprocal
basis between countries. That would certainly be a bad deal for the U.K.''

   Though BT, Mercury Communications Ltd., AT&T and MCI Communications
Corp. have been in discussions for a year, the timing of their proposals
for a new accounting rate between the United Kingdom and the United States
reflects both the Oftel announcement on resale and last week's reply
deadline for the FCC inquiry.

   However, major differences exist between the proposals. AT&T, MCI
and Mercury have agreed to a single rate that will reduce the current
per-minute accounting rate from $1.06 to $0.76 by January
1991, falling to $0.40 by January 1993. But Mercury intends to abolish
its current off-peak rate.

   By contrast, AT&T, MCI and BT have agreed on two rates. The full
rate will be reduced from the current $1.06 to $0.76 by January
1991 and $0.44 by January 1993. The current off-peak rate will be
cut from $0.76 to $0.48 by January 1991 and $0.35 by
January 1993.

   ``We think the Mercury proposal to have a single rate is retrograde and
not in the interests of customers,'' said Adam Scott, BT international
affairs director.

   Mercury's low penetration of the residential market means it is
disadvantaged in offering very low off-peak rates.

   In fact, second-tier carriers such as Mercury and MCI will probably be
the hardest hit by international resale. While AT&T and BT, for
example, can weather fierce price competition because of their market shares,
the likes of Mercury and MCI have until now been winning market share by
undercutting the dominant carriers.

   A freer regulatory climate will also allow the larger carriers to be more
aggressive on price and in repackaging services for bulk discounts and virtual
private networks. If global VPNs are to flourish, more flexible international
accounting rates are essential.

   Just when telecoms resale between the United Kingdom and the United States
will begin depends on the outcome of the duopoly review, but discussions are
also underway between those countries and Japan and Sweden.

EUROPE NEXT?

   The pace of developments in the more liberalized markets is both exposing
gross tariff distortions in mainland Europe and placing pressure on the
European Commission to act.

   In March, the Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications
administrations withdrew a controversial recommendation on principles for the
use of leased lines and the establishment of private networks-after being
advised by the Commission's competition directorate that the plan
amounted to a price agreement, restricted competition and breached Community
competition law.

   This action established a powerful precedent for the way leased lines
are priced and provided Europe-wide. And through tough new ``Competition
Guidelines'' the Commission is expected to adopt this year, it is
challenging the anti-competitive implications of the D-series
recommendations of the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative
Committee. The D-series currently sets pricing and supply conditions for
international leased circuits.

   Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner of competition, said the
Commission's  preliminary examination confirmed gross international
tariff distortions, but not necessarily evidence of a telephone company
``cartel.''

   ``There is prima face evidence, not of a conspiracy, but there is
something curious,'' Brittan said. ``So we are
launching a more formal investigation on prices to see what causes these
irrational, inexplicable and disturbing
discrepencies.''

DUOPOLY REVIEW Second Of A Series -- Cable Operators
Take On BT

    By DAWN HAYES

         LONDON

   Betting that the upcoming U.K. telecoms duopoly review will loosen
restrictions, cable TV operators at home and abroad are challenging British
Telecom's domination of local-loop telephone service.

   United Artists International, in partnership with U S West Inc., has been
granted approval by the Office of Telecommunications to run telephone service
to U.K. homes and businesses within its franchise area. And Canadian telecoms
holding company BCE Ltd. has applied to Oftel to initiate its first foray into
local telephone service in the United Kingdom, in partnership with Canadian
cable TV company Le Groupe Videotron.

   Only four of 135 cable TV operators in the United Kingdom offer telephone
service in what Oftel director general Sir Bryan Carsberg calls
experiments: Windsor Television Ltd., Cable Camden Ltd., East London
Telecommunications Ltd., and now United Artists.

   But more and more are expected to do so should Oftel ease local-loop
restrictions in its duopoly review.

   Cable companies already are allowed to provide all telecoms and datacoms
services; they must, however, be switched by either BT or Mercury
Communications Ltd.

   The U.K. Cable Television Association contends that present regulations
make it difficult for users to switch from one of the two main carriers to
cable TV operator networks. Users must add new, separate phone numbers to make
calls through a cable provider and must buy new wiring to change
operators.

   Despite today's constrictions, United Artists, a $1.2 billion cable
television and cinema company based in Denver, Colorado, this month
launched limited integrated services to business customers in Croydon and
to residential customers in Sutton.

   But Peter Streames, marketing operations manager, said phase two will
extend the service to many more customers in its franchise areas, depending,
that is, on the outcome of the duopoly review.

   In what observers interpret as the clearest indication yet of what his
position on cable television will be in the forthcoming duopoly review,
Carsberg last month pointed to cable TV as a key to unlocking the cozy
BT-Mercury telecoms duopoly.

    He said restrictions on cable TV companies must be reassessed but that in
return they may have to accept some form of universal-service obligation,
providing full service to residential customers and the more lucrative
business accounts.

INDUSTRY PROPOSAL

   Michael Storey, director of corporate strategy and public affairs at
Videotron, said the industry has proposed that cable TV companies be able to
lay their own networks free of BT or Mercury, interconnect with one
another's networks, and opt not to provide service to everyone in
their franchise areas.

   Still, the industry says it is willing to strike a balance to open the
local network to competition.

   There's incentive to compromise. So far cable television has
disappointed regulators and investors alike.

   Broadband cable television was first licensed in the United Kingdom in
1983, but only 0.5 percent of U.K. homes are connected to broadband cable,
according to London consultancy Enator Ltd.

   Beyond regulatory constraints, the cable TV companies have encountered
competition from other television distributors, including direct broadcast by
satellite. In addition, the removal of favorable tax incentives in 1984 slowed
the rate of cable construction over the last decade.

   Chris Akers, a London-based media analyst with Citicorp Investment
Bank Ltd., maintains that a shift in local-loop restrictions could boost
cable industry profits 10 percent.

   According to a recent Citicorp report, 90 percent of the United Kingdom
will have access to cable by December 2000, and 45 percent of homes will be
connected, assuming Oftel allows cable television companies to offer telephone
service without consent from British Telecom or Mercury.

FRESH BLOOD

   The Broadcasting Bill, which goes through Parliament this month, could give
the industry an infusion of fresh blood. It is expected to further free
restrictions on ownership of cable companies, enabling U.S. companies to fully
own and operate U.K. cable subsidiaries for the first time.

   Technology is a driving force behind the cable company push into
telecommunications. Fiber optics offers the high bandwidth needed for
integrated communications, thus blurring the boundary between broadcast and
telecoms.

   Meanwhile, the combined revenues from cable TV and telecoms services
strengthens the economic incentive for replacing copper wire in the local loop
with fiber optics.

    This was the conclusion of a government-sponsored study into
television funding in 1986. Called the Peacock Committee Report, it
recommended that British Telecom build and operate a national fiber optic grid
network, financed in part by the government.

   However, the proposal was at odds with the Conservative government's
free-market policy, which opposes public funding of large infrastructure
projects. The subsequent development of the mobile communications market
under the government's competitive policy further weakened the Peacock
Report's recommendations.

    A follow-up report, called the MacDonald Report, recommended that the
national grid approach be abandoned in favor of competition in the local
network from cable and mobile communications, driven by market demand.

BT MOVES

   BT itself invested in the cable TV industry over the last seven years but
plans to dispose of all those interests by the end of the year. BT says it
already has a local network and does not need to duplicate it with a cable TV
infrastructure.

   A BT spokesman said the move also relates to a drive to cut non-core
businesses.

   Kristen Hansen, with consultancy Enator, believes BT's goal is to
get out of cable television as a bargaining chip to persuade the government to
allow it to run entertainment services over its public network.

   BT argues that if the cable TV operators are given carte blanche to compete
in telecoms, Oftel must allow the former monopoly to compete on a commercial
basis in entertainment services.

   Currently, BT is permitted to carry broadcast television only so far as TV
companies' transmitters.

   This week, BT will launch a pilot integrated telephone/television service
in the Bishops Stortford area. The company has a special license to run the
service to test demand.

   Carsberg said BT would be permitted to provide entertainment services, but
emphasized that such a move would have to be timed to give cable television
companies a head start.

   While observers say this is a likely post-duopoly review scenario, the
timing remains in question.

   For Mercury's part, cable television could be the answer to criticism
that it failed to penetrate the local telephone service market other than
over BT's network.

   At the moment, to reach customers in areas not accessed by its fiber optic
trunk system connecting the major U.K. cities, Mercury sends calls via the BT
network.

   Mercury would like to see some restrictions on the cable companies freed,
but it does not want them to operate independently of either U.K. telecoms
operator. This way, Mercury can extend its reach via the cable company
networks.

   The cable television association maintains, however, that using cable to
extend Mercury's network amounts to extending the current duopoly.
Mercury does not favor introduction of additional trunk carriers.

OBSERVERS OPTIMISTIC

   For all the back and forth, industry observers are optimistic about cable
television's foray into telephony.

    Citicorp's Akers said he is confident that the duopoly review
will look favorably on cable television companies because there is presently
next to no competition in the local loop.

   ``They deserve some payback,'' Akers said.

   Meanwhile, the cable companies can only mull over Carsberg's
cryptic comment: ``Every referee knows there's no
such thing as a level playing field, only one in which both teams are playing
uphill.''

EDITORIAL -- Lines Of Resistance

    The recommendation by the U.K. Office of Telecommunications to open the
market for international simple resale of telecoms services is a
watershed.

   Its true impact may not be seen for a decade, but, if adopted by the U.K.
government, it would spell an end to the old order.

   In essence, it would undermine the regime of cozy, cooperative
relationships between national telecoms carriers that has underpinned the
industry for more than a century. It would signal the beginning of the end of
the accounting-rate mechanism between carriers that has propped up that
regime. And it would herald a new era of tariff arbitrage where the battle
between service suppliers would be for the delivery of end-to-end
telecoms services, delivered door-to-door.

   Equally important, international resale would allow large users to break
free of existing supplier relationships and, if they choose, engage in network
bypass for the first time. All business users, meanwhile, would quickly reap
the benefits of increased price competition.

   Everywhere, the cracks are beginning to show in the structure of
international telecoms tariffs. And the growing awareness that international
tariffs are not even remotely related to the cost of providing service is
reflected in a range of policy initiatives:

   o In Europe, the European Commission's competition directorate is
questioning the legality of long-standing International Telegraph and
Telephone Consultative Committee tariff recommendations under European
Community competition law. Separately, its telecoms directorate is
expected to issue a communication on voice telephony, leased-line and data
tariffs later this year.

   o In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission last
Friday received comments on its proposals for reforming the international
accounting rate system, which sets the negotiated sum between two carriers for
each international call. AT&T has already negotiated a major
accounting rate reduction with Canada. Both AT&T and MCI
Communications Corp. have now proposed major reductions with British Telecom
and Mercury Communications Ltd.

   o In Japan, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications'
introduction of equal-access arrangements for competitive carriers has
led to a substantial loss of market for former monopoly Kokusai Denshin Denwa.


   To some extent, these initiatives reflect different priorities. The
principal concern of the FCC is to reduce the telecoms portion of the U.S.
trade deficit. The European Commission is attempting to foster a
Europe-wide telecoms space before the opening of the single market
post-1992. Oftel and Japan's MPT are looking to increase
competition in their markets.

   But behind them all is an economic dynamic that can no longer be
denied.

   The dramatic growth in international telecoms traffic during the 1980s and
the impact of new technology are driving the industry toward new regulatory
arrangements on tariffs, accounting rates and leased lines.

   Already, the line of resistance against sweeping price reductions on
international tariffs is proving impossible to hold. And the expected
bilateral agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States on
international resale would place intense pressure on Europe's
monopoly operators to follow the same course.

   Overall, however, the present situation is inherently unstable and the
balance between an orderly transition and a market free-for-all is
looking increasingly fragile.

   On the one hand, it invites the abuse of monopoly power; on the other,
price cutting and uneconomic entry by new competitors that may impair
long-term industry investment.

   Multilateral reform of the present system, although preferable, will likely
take years. Meantime, the instability that has become the hallmark of
today's telecoms industry will continue to hold sway and progress
will be made primarily through bilateral agreements.

PERSPECTIVE -- Break Down Barriers

    By COLIN LONG

         Current national rules in all European countries other than the
United Kingdom and Germany will usually serve to prevent value-added
services from being retailed to end-users.

   In an era when most of the talk is of liberalization and of European
Commission initiatives to open up telecommunications markets, this might seem
surprising, but the reasons are simple.

    Under the cloak of national rules and international recommendations
preventing the use of leased circuits for the simple transport of data, such
services are treated as an infringement of the telecoms
administration's local monopoly and therefore are prohibited.

   Only where a substantial value-added service element can be
demonstrated will the ban normally be avoided.

   Even the Commission's recent directive on competition in telecoms
services may not get to grips with this problem. The Commission has accepted
that leased lines should be treated as a special case and that telecoms
administrations should not be obliged to allow simple resale services until
1993 at the earliest.

   The Commission definition of ``simple resale'' is the provision of data
transmission over leased lines as a ``separate service,'' including such
switching, data storage and protocol conversion as is necessary for
transmission in real time to and from the public switched network.

   This rather vague definition begs the question as to the status of a
bundled value-added or managed data network service. It may also differ
markedly from the comparative approach in individual member states.

   While messages may not currently be transmissible over privately operated
data communication networks with public connections, one message is
clear: Anyone offering an international managed data network service and
the benefits of one-stop shopping will have to be prepared to take on the
more recalcitrant telecoms administrations and use European treaty competition
rules and the European Commission to help break down the barriers.

   The real effects of the Commission's service directive may be
some years away. Meantime, these competition rules could accelerate
deregulation.

   In particular, once telecoms administrations begin to cooperate to provide
one-stop managed services, it will be difficult to prevent
non-telecoms administration service providers seeking the same
arrangements.

FACILITIES MANAGEMENT COMPETITION ON RISE -- New
Carrier-Industry Force

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

         LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM-The French and Belgian
telecoms administrations and datacoms equipment manufacturer Groupe Telinfo SA
have formed a company to offer international facilities management
services.

   The company, called Eftel SA, underscores the developing competition for
lucrative facilities management business between Europe's
telecommunications administrations and traditional value-added network
service providers, such as Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS).

   Facilities management embraces everything from purchasing all of a
customer's computing and networking operations, including the staffs
that run them, to monitoring the traffic on a customer's network to
make sure it is configured properly.

   The main activities of Eftel, based in Louvain-la-Neuve, a suburb
of Brussels, will be consultancy and engineering services and network
operation in the form of facilities management or value-added
networks.

   Eftel partner France Cables et Radio, a unit of France Telecom, has
experience in consultancy and engineering. Besides basic telephony,
Belgium's Regie des Telegraphes et Telephones (RTT)
provides communications services such as packet-switched data and
integrated services digital networks.

   Studies show that 20 percent to 30 percent of European communications users
would consider letting a third party run their network.

   ``I see battles looming between major players in facilities management
without a PTT member, and those PTTs who have taken the bit between the
teeth directly or indirectly through a technically based company,'' said
Roger Barber, manager of the telecommunications forum at the Butler Cox
Foundation, in London.

   British Telecom recently announced its intention to offer global facilities
management services through its BT Tymnet Inc. unit, bringing it into
competition with other European telecoms administration in their home
markets.

   In the case of Eftel, Barber said, ``a very powerful company has
been created which taps the resources of the PTTs and the resources of Telinfo
itself.''

   Telinfo, based in Brussels, was formed in August from the merger earlier in
the year of Telindus SA, a Brussels-based manufacturer of modems and
multiplexers, and Informabel, a Belgian systems integrator (see
box).

   Telinfo general manager Jean-Marie Polet said Eftel gives his company,
which already has a close supplier relationship with the RTT, immediate access
to the international customer base of the Belgian and French telecoms
administrations.

CUSTOMERS LINED UP

   The joint-venture company's first customers are Citicorp
Luxembourg, which awarded Eftel a contract to upgrade its existing networks,
and the Belgian National Bank, which has asked Eftel to evaluate tenders for a
local area network installation in the bank's offices.

   Eftel's current business is mostly in Belgium but the company is
hoping to expand internationally.

   Eftel general manager Daniel Brismee said the company wants to build an
organization like SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunications, a consortium that links banks and other financial
institutions worldwide. Eftel wants to work with industry-specific groups
to build up specialized international VANs, he said.

   If Eftel concentrates on specialized business sectors, Butler
Cox's Barber said, it should be better positioned than other VANS
providers, such as EDS. The alliance of public network operators with
equipment suppliers puts them in a position of strength, he said.

   ``This is an important marketing tool in the armory of the PTT
marketeers,'' Barber said. ``Now they can say, `We can provide you with
the lines and the services and run them for you.' But this implies a
greater understanding of business requirements than PTTs have classically
demonstrated.''

   But because public network operators generally have difficulty getting
close to user needs, Barber said, Eftel could turn out to be a
``technically sound company without a great deal of business
acumen.''

Merger Is Part Of Industry Trend

    By Jennifer L. Schenker

         The merger in Belgium of modem and multiplexer manufacturer Telindus
SA with information technology company Informabel SA reflects the European
trend toward computer-communications alliances.

   The merger of Telindus and Informabel formed Groupe Telinfo SA, which
offers data communications and computer applications products and develops and
manages network solutions, said Jean-Marie Polet, Telinfo general
manager.

   He said the company's strength over competing software houses and
telecoms equipment manufacturers is its ability to offer customers complete
computer and communications solutions.

   Such user demand has led to similar mergers, said Richard Mitchell, an
industry analyst at Dataquest Ltd., of Denham, England.

   For example, London-based Psion plc, a maker of hand-held computer
terminals, formally merged with London communications company Dacom
Systems Ltd. and became Psion Dacom plc last month. Similarly, the
Chippenham, England, information technology division of diversified
aerospace company Dowty Group plc acquired the Danish local area network
systems company Dataco AS in June of this year.

   ``I think corporate users expect to see and like to have one-stop
shopping,'' Mitchell said. Invitations to tender cover modems, X.25 packet
switches and a host of computer-related items, meaning the pressure is on
companies to offer expertise in many areas.

   ``If a company can provide only 70 percent of the contract and
somebody else can do all of it, and take into account maintenance of the whole
thing, it is obvious who is going to come out ahead,''
Mitchell said.

   Telindus, which has expertise in wide area networks, local area networks
and message handling systems, has subsidiaries throughout Europe and is
present in both the Asia-Pacific region and the United States.

   Informabel, a software provider with competence centers for different
computer environments and for specialized business sectors such as banking and
industry, has subsidiaries in France, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Morocco and
Tunisia. It is setting up subsidiaries in four more European countries, as
well as Zaire and Brazil.

   The merged company, Telinfo, is concentrating on business opportunities in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

   It is also vying for contracts to provide the Portuguese telecommunications
administration with multiplexers and controlling software for a new digital
network, general manager Polet said.

Germany Offers ISDN Incentives

    By John Blau

         BONN-Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, looking to stimulate demand
for its nationwide ISDN, has launched an incentive program that includes
bonuses for first-time users.

   From 1 October to 31 December, the German network operator is offering the
following bonuses:

   o DM 444 ($300) for basic rate access with call-transfer and at least
one ISDN telephone;

   o DM 888 ($600) for basic rate access with call-transfer, an ISDN
telephone, in addition to access to the analog cellular telephone or
paging networks and a videotex connection;

   o DM 888 for basic rate access with four ISDN telephones and one
terminal adapter or an ISDN teletex terminal; and

   o DM 2,000 for users of existing or new ISDN-capable PBX units
with one or more interfaces.

   The four-part program comes on the heels of DBP Telekom's
promotion of ISDN PC adapter cards, aimed at achieving mass-market
penetration of ISDN services.

   Since April, those in Germany that sign up for basic rate access and also
buy a PC card are given a DM 888 credit on their phone bill.

   The German network operator retreated from its plan to distribute free
cards last year after drawing sharp criticism from the industry, which viewed
the free promotion as anti-competitive.

   DBP Telekom has also been stimulating interest in ISDN by developing
applications with German companies.

French Look At Audiotex

    By Anne-Marie Roussel

         PARIS-Responding to pressure from French audiotex phone-service
providers, France Telecom has created a new audiotex division, whose
director, Jean-Paul Maury, will recommend changes in 18 months for
promoting the industry.

   Maury is considered the father of France's Minitel videotex
system.

   Service providers have argued that France Telecom's tariff and
access rules for audiotex hamper development of their phone services. Audiotex
is most commonly used in France for banking, making reservations, placing bets
and ordering goods from catalogs.

   Basic audiotex services deliver taped messages, while more sophisticated
versions establish a dialog between a caller and a voice-activated
computer.

   Aftel, the French association of audiotex providers, wants France Telecom
to make its tariff structure more flexible and its policy for obtaining lines
less bureaucratic.

   In a recently published white paper, Aftel says the only two tariff options
France Telecom makes available are toll-free numbers and
semi-toll-free numbers (whereby the cost is equally shared by
the caller and the service provider). Aftel would prefer more
options.

   In addition, because the application process is bottlenecked, no new lines
have been made available, said Aftel president Jean-Luc Lenart.

   France Telecom intends to develop audiotex cautiously, said Jean-Claude
Mailhan, director of commercial and telematic affairs. He said the French
operator wants to avoid repeating its videotex experience-whose rapid
growth spurred the proliferation of pornographic services over Minitel.

HONG KONG OFFICIALS LOOK TO FUTURE -- Telecoms Views
Mixed

    By ROBERT POE

         HONG KONG

   Telecoms officials and users in Hong Kong disagree sharply over the
territory's future as a regional communications hub.

   Top-level officials with the territory's dominant telecommunications
operator and regulatory body say the prospects for Hong Kong continuing as
Asia's main communications hub could not be brighter. But according to one
major user, the British colony's return to Chinese control on 1 July 1997
presents potentially enormous problems, and Hong Kong may already be
losing its regional telecoms edge.

   ``As far as we are concerned, it is just another date,'' said Mike
Gale, chief executive of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. ``It should
continue as it does today. It's a change of sovereignty, but in terms of
the ability to come and go, of currency, of free trade and so on, it'll
continue just as it is today.''

   Although China International Trust & Investment Corp. owns 20
percent of Hong Kong Telecom, the Chinese government institution does not take
an active management role, Gale said.

   Postmaster general Dominic Wong, who is in charge of both postal and
telecommunications regulation in the territory, agreed with Gale's
assessment. ``It [1997] is still a political date as such,'' he said. ``In
terms of our planning and expectations, it has never featured in a very
significant way.''

   Users are not reassured, however. ``If you have a company that
has its telecoms hub in Hong Kong, if you've got everything running
out of Hong Kong, as a lot of companies have, then if the Chinese decide to
march into Hong Kong and shut it down in 1997, the company would go out of
business,'' said David Manion, communications manager for
Asia at Reuters South East Asia Ltd., in Hong Kong.

   Although few are convinced this will happen, Manion said, failing to guard
against the possibility means ``gambling the whole of your Asian
business.''

POLITICAL RISK

   Manion, who is head of the Hong Kong Telecommunications Users Group, said
most major communications users are giving at least some consideration to
moving facilities elsewhere.

   The political risk is one reason Reuters moved a major telecoms
technical center to Tokyo. ``You can leave people here, because they can
get on the next plane,'' Manion said, ``but as far as physical facilities,
you have to look at diversifying.''

   Another reason for the move was what Reuters perceived as a decline in
Hong Kong's competitive advantage as a strategic telecoms location-the
result, according to Manion, of modernization by other nations in the
region.

   ``Hong Kong was until a few years ago without question the
telecommunications center of the Asia-Pacific,'' he said. ``But over the
last few years they haven't moved. The rest of the region has, and they've
started to catch up, and in some cases they've overtaken them. I think
Singapore has overtaken Hong Kong. They're building up their advantage all
the time.''

   Hong Kong Telecom's Gale disagrees, noting that 60 percent of the
company's phone calls now go through digital exchanges. All
exchanges are to be digital by 1994. ``I don't think there
are many places that can match that,'' he said.

   Gale said Hong Kong Telecom will spend about HK $3 billion (US
$385 million) both this year and next to expand and modernize.

   Furthermore, Hong Kong is ahead of Singapore in setting up international
communications over undersea optical fiber cables, he said. ``A
customer now who's looking for a fiber optic link to Europe or the
United States can get it out of Hong Kong today,'' Gale
said. Singapore has no fiber optic cables operational for international
telecoms service, he said.

   But this advantage will not last for long, Reuters' Manion noted. The
SEA-ME-WE-2 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) cable, stretching
from Singapore to Marseille, France, is expected to be operational by
1994.

   ``That's got to be important,'' Manion said. ``By then they will have
the whole network linked along the Pacific Rim. The ideal choice would be
one route [in each direction]. Total diversity is the name of the game.''

GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGE

   Another Hong Kong advantage, according to Gale, is geographic. Besides its
position as a gateway to China-``the great potential market of
the future''-Hong Kong is also more central to the
Far East as a whole, he said.

   The advantages of location, however, are being eroded or perhaps even
negated by other developments in the region, according to Manion.
``Before, when there was only one position used as a hub, Hong Kong was
always very well positioned,'' he said. ``But now Tokyo is offering itself
as a hub, and it's got a lot going for it, because the first fiber cables
across the Pacific are based in Tokyo, and because of prices.''

   Prices on international routes out of Japan have dropped substantially
since the introduction of competition in October 1989-Reuters' second
major reason, other than the politics of 1997, for moving its technical
center to Tokyo. ``We believe that where it exists, competition must make
the environment more friendly to the user,'' Manion said.

   Tokyo's problem is its geographic position at the top end of the
Asia-Pacific region, Manion said, the solution to which is to have a
smaller hub farther down.

   ``If you put it in Hong Kong, it's only one stop down the road,'' he
said. ``But if it's in Singapore, it's very well positioned geographically
to serve all of Southeast Asia. So if you go for this sort of diverse
hubs, Hong Kong seems to fall between them. It seems to be caught in a
trap.''

UNDENIABLE ADVANTAGE

   But Manion added that the colony does have one undeniable advantage over
both Singapore and Tokyo: experience, which helps when it comes to
sorting out problems on the other end of the network connection.

   One of Reuters' major problems is getting the Japanese to deal
internationally rather than just looking after themselves. ``They haven't
really caught onto the game they're supposed to play,'' Manion said. ``If
there's a problem somewhere at the other end, they tend to report it to
the other end, and then sit back and say `that's my job done.' ''

   Corporate telecoms managers can be certain, as they ponder Hong Kong's
future as a communications hub, that their decisions will not come easily.
``Hong Kong's a great place,'' Manion said. ``Nobody wants to leave it.
But you have to assess the risks and take reasonable precautions if you're
a responsible businessman.''

Nynex Breakup Considered -- Agency Suggests Divesting
Phone Company Unit

    By DAWN BUSHAUS

         NEW YORK-The New York Public Service Commission, reacting to
alleged business improprieties at Nynex Corp., is investigating the structure
of the Bell company and the possibility of divesting its New York Telephone
Co. subsidiary.

   The New York PSC is the first U.S. state regulatory commission to look at
divesting a Bell operating company from its regional holding company
parent.

   The decision came at the suggestion of William Cowan, the commission's
general counsel, in a report issued this month examining alleged Nynex
business improprieties in Florida.

   Lawrence Friedman, former vice president of purchasing at Nynex Materiel
Enterprises Co. (MECO), was fired in 1988 for his reported role in
organizing Florida parties at which officials allegedly brought prostitutes
for suppliers and took part in other questionable business practices.

   In his report, Cowan said the alleged improprieties, combined with earlier
allegations that MECO had overcharged Nynex's two operating
companies, are reasons to consider divesting New York Telephone.

   Nynex chairman William Ferguson said the company will cooperate with
the PSC investigation, but said divestiture of New York Telephone ``is not
an option.'' A company spokesman said Nynex would challenge a divestiture
order in court.

   Most users said they do not believe a divestiture of New York Telephone
from Nynex will solve any problems.

   ``I think the whole situation-the regulated side buying from the
unregulated side-needs closer auditing, but I don't necessarily believe
divestiture is the answer,'' said Ronald Kopitowski, telecoms director at
the Metropolitan Transit Authority and president of the Communications
Managers Association.

   ``The user community wants good service in a stable environment,'' said
Henry Levine, partner with Morrison & Foerster, a Washington law firm that
represents several large communications users in the financial-services
industry. ``If divestiture would advance that, then users would give it
their support, but if it would retard that, they likely would not support
it.''

   In a related matter, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and
Nynex reached an agreement this month resolving FCC allegations that
Nynex's unregulated MECO unit had excessively charged the regulated New
York Telephone and New England Telephone & Telegraph Co. units for
equipment and services. The overcharging was alleged to have occurred from
1984 to 1988 as part of a scam to pad Nynex profits.

   The two Nynex operating units have agreed to cut interstate access rates by
$35.5 million and pay the U.S. Treasury $1.4 million. In return,
the commission will drop a proceeding against the two companies without
concluding that they violated FCC rules.

   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, which
regulates New England Telephone, will keep a close eye on the New York PSC
investigation, said Susan Tierney, a DPU commissioner. The DPU has ordered an
audit of transactions between New England Telephone and MECO.

HIGH-SPEED AHEAD FOR US SPRINT, MCI -- Carriers
Emphasize Data

    By ROBIN GAREISS

         SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA-Communications users with applications
that demand high-speed data transmission welcomed this month's
announcements by US Sprint Communications Co. and MCI Communications Corp.

   US Sprint is the first U.S. long distance carrier to disclose plans to
provide a frame-relay service, aimed at satisfying growing user demand
for high-speed packet switching.

   Meanwhile, rival MCI unveiled a family of high-speed data services
that initially will give users access to T1 and DS-3 circuits on an
as-needed basis.

   Both carriers made their announcements at the Tele-Communications
Association's conference in San Diego this month.

   US Sprint said it will offer a frame-relay service late next year. The
initial rollout will provide only data services.

   Frame relay-a faster method of packet switching-can transmit
information at the T1 speed of 1.544 megabits per second. But unlike X.25, it
does not offer error correction, switched virtual connections or access
control. X.25 switches at lower speeds, however.

   As a public network operator, US Sprint will provide the link for users
who want to build hybrid private-public networks. US Sprint's frame-relay
network is intended to complement the SprintNet X.25 packet switching data
network. Ultimately, frame relay will provide access to broadband network
services.

   ``Overall, Sprint is setting itself up in this bandwidth-on-demand
marketplace as a leader,'' said Berge Ayvazian, an analyst at The Yankee
Group, in Boston. He said he expects MCI to announce a frame-relay service
based on Northern Telecom Ltd. technology.

   Although specific pricing is not yet available, it is expected that US
Sprint will charge users a fixed rate with usage-based charges for peak
periods.

   US Sprint's fiber optic network and Telenet Processor/III 4900
packet switches will support the system. US Sprint will use Integrated Packet
Exchange switches from StrataCom Inc. and market them as US Sprint's
TP7900 packet-based multiplexers for future voice, video and data
applications.

   US Sprint officials said users have not demanded frame-relay voice
services, so the initial rollout will contain only data components. In later
phases of frame relay, US Sprint will offer voice and video services, said
Floyd Trogdon, senior vice president at US Sprint Data Group.

      The frame-relay service initially will be available in the United
States, Japan and the United Kingdom and later extended to other European
countries.

MCI OFFERING

   MCI's Initial Virtual Private Data Service offerings will let
users transmit data at switched T1 and DS-3 (45-mbps)
speeds.

   The service, which will not be generally available until mid-1991,
marks the first time switched T1 and switched DS-3 are available through
a high-speed, virtual private network, MCI officials said. MCI will
devote a portion of its public network to VPDS offerings.

   AT&T has not dedicated a portion of its network to its virtual
private data network, the Software Defined Data Network. And the highest speed
AT&T has committed to with SDDN is 384 kilobits per second.

   Many communications managers at the largest U.S. companies want switched T1
services, especially for cases where they transmit heavy amounts of digital
traffic on an irregular basis, such as for videoconferencing.

   ``We cannot afford the dedicated facilities to handle full-motion
video,'' said Ed Forhan, communications manager at The Walker Group, a
chain of retail stores based in Westminster, Colorado. ``Any service that
gives small companies the ability to have video service is a big
benefit.''

   MCI must still determine which switching and billing systems it will use
with the VPDS.

   Some analysts questioned the timing of the announcement because MCI could
not provide detailed plans for the service's implementation.

FCC Gets Input On PCN Proposals

    By KATHLEEN KILLETTE

         WASHINGTON-Personal communications services are natural
extensions of cellular technology and so the United States must let the
cellular industry take the lead in introducing them, according to many of the
comments submitted this month to the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission.

   The FCC began an inquiry in June into PCS-the American term for
personal communications network (PCN) services. In its inquiry, the
FCC sought comments on the amount of spectrum needed for PCS, the types of
technologies that should be given priority, the technical standards that
should govern PCS and the degree to which providers should be regulated.

   The FCC also proposed excluding telephone companies and cellular mobile
radio licensees from providing PCS in areas they already serve, to ensure that
the fledgling market is open to entrepreneurs.

   Telephone companies and mobile service providers disagreed with that
proposal. ``The exclusion of these qualified participants would
needlessly limit the availability of PCS,'' stated GTE
Service Corp.

   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association said the cellular
industry already offers efficient, affordable, lightweight, two-way
personal communications services via portable cellular phones, and that
several cellular companies are poised to initiate PCS trials.

   Those experiments, the CTIA stated, should lay the groundwork for the FCC
in measuring the need for PCS spectrum.

`DISTINCTION ARTIFICIAL'

   Nynex Corp. agreed, adding that the FCC ``should recognize that
any distinction between cellular and PCS would be highly artificial and that
the success of the cellular operations in the 800- to 900-megahertz
range should not be `truncated' by allotting too many resources
to PCS development.''

   Nynex plans to introduce the first wireless Personal Telephone Service
early next year in New York City.

   Telocator, a Washington-based association that represents paging and
cellular companies, opposed the FCC's proposal to use spectrum now
reserved for advanced paging frequencies-in the 930- to 931-MHz
range-for PCS.

   Manufacturers also weighed in on the PCS issue. Northern Telecom Inc.
stated as top priorities the establishment of a common numbering plan,
fostering network interoperability and efficient bandwidth utilization, and
prevention of interference. It proposed an open standard-called personal
communications interface (PCI)-for low-power, wireless
PCS.

   PCI, based on the CT2 standards being considered in Canada, would rely on
two-way communications channels and separate common channels for call
setup signaling. This approach would use bandwidth more efficiently, and give
users faster call setups and longer battery life for portable cellular phones,
Northern said.

   Apple Computer Inc. noted that the PCS proposals presented to the FCC have
focused mainly on voice communications, and recommended the allocation of
spectrum to ``Data-PCS.''

   Apple proposed allocating frequencies in the 1.7- to 2.3-gigahertz band
to be used exclusively for high-speed data communications within office
buildings, linking laptop computers via low-power transmitters.

Fujitsu Boosting U.S. Switch Effort

    By ROBERT POE

         RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA-Fujitsu Ltd. is boosting efforts to
adapt its digital exchange to the U.S. network, in anticipation of the
$40 billion public switch changeout expected to take place in the
United States over the next 10 to 15 years.

   Fujitsu plans to increase the number of U.S. staffers in charge of selling
and engineering the Fetex-150 switch to 600 by 1994 from the current 100,
company officials in Tokyo said.

   The increase will shift development of sophisticated switch features to the
United States from Japan, said one observer familiar with the
Raleigh-based subsidiary.

   Officials at Fujitsu Network Switching of America Inc. disclosed few
details.

   Most of the current staff there are working on testing the performance and
network conformance of software developed in Japan, the observer said. With
the expansion, the subsidiary will take on responsibility for developing
functions and capabilities required by U.S. customers.

   The Fetex-150 is Fujitsu's export-model exchange switch, with more than
8.8 million lines installed or on order in 17 countries. None have been
sold in the United States, but the recently announced plans confirm
longstanding speculation that the Japanese manufacturer is planning a
major push into the U.S. market.

   When Fujitsu won a major switch tender in Singapore last autumn,
competitors complained the company was selling the equipment at cost to win a
prestigious contract that would serve as a stepping stone to the U.S.
market.

   Fujitsu said its switch has passed Phase 1 and 2 evaluations by Bell
Communications Research Inc., the research arm of the seven U.S. Bell
companies.

   Although the certification is considered essential to selling to the
Bells-which account for about 75 percent of U.S. telephone lines-it
may not be enough for Fujitsu to break into a market dominated by
AT&T and Northern Telecom Inc.

   The two manufacturers have more than 90 percent of the U.S. market. A share
like that, coupled with Bell company inertia in changing to new suppliers,
leaves foreign public switch manufacturers largely out in the cold, analysts
say.

   The U.S. subsidiaries of Siemens AG, L.M. Ericsson, NEC Corp. and GEC
Plessey Telecommunications Ltd. have found the U.S. market tough to crack,
though each has had limited success and are further along than Fujitsu.

   ``There's an inherent conservatism on the part of their [U.S.] customer
base,'' said Robert Rosenberg, director of analytical services at The
Eastern Management Group, in Parsippany, New Jersey. ``These are huge
companies with billions of dollars invested in their current equipment.

   ``Even if Fujitsu comes up with a switch that has all the bells
and whistles that an engineer could ever want, if all the support systems have
to be rebuilt in order to fit that switch into the network, his manager
won't let him install it,'' according to
Rosenberg.

First Telmex Bidders Step Forward

    By DAVID ROCKS

         MEXICO CITY-U.S. Bell company Nynex Corp. and
Canada's BCE Inc. have teamed with a Mexican partner to bid for
operating control of Mexico's telephone network.

   The two companies plan to join Casa de Bolsa Inverlat Associates, a Mexican
investment group, in their bid for Telefonos de Mexico SA.

   The Mexican government plans to sell its 20.4 percent controlling interest
in Telmex, with bids due 15 November. Although several groups are expected to
tender offers, the Nynex-BCE-Inverlat consortium is the first to go
public with its intentions.

   Telmex, with some 5.5 million access lines in a country of 88 million
people, is a highly profitable monopoly and is considered to have enormous
growth potential.

   The winning bidder will, however, face a daunting task in upgrading service
and modernizing the network, much of which dates to the 1960s.

   ``There is a lot of room for improvement in their service,'' said
Eugene LaBorne, a Nynex International official working in Mexico City to
put the bid together. For example, he said, some 1.2 million people are
waiting to have a telephone installed.

   Forty percent of Telmex stock consists of voting shares. The Mexican
government now controls 51 percent of those shares, while the rest of the
company is held by private investors.

OWNERSHIP DETAILS

   The government is seeking to sell its stake-20.4 percent of the
total-to an investment group controlled by Mexicans.

   Inverlat will control 51 percent of the consortium, while BCE and Nynex
will likely split the balance, LaBorne said.

   Representatives of BCE, the Canadian telecoms holding company that includes
Bell Canada and Northern Telecom Ltd., and Nynex, which provides New York and
New England with phone service, are in Mexico working out the details of the
bid, LaBorne said.

   The market value of Telmex stock is about $7 billion, so the 20.4
percent stake for sale should fetch about $1.4 billion.

   Laborne said the government's selection will likely hinge as much
on each bidder's service and network-improvement plan as on the
cash offered.

   As a U.S. Bell company, Nynex will face regulatory impediments should its
consortium be selected. The AT&T divestiture agreement prohibits the
Bells from carrying long distance phone traffic in the United States, which
means Nynex would not be allowed to handle U.S.-bound calls from
Telmex-the bulk of the company's international business.

   Nynex believes the problem is surmountable, LaBorne said.

   There is some precedent for a waiver of the rule. Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Ameritech, Bell companies that recently bought a stake in Telecom Corp. of New
Zealand, have been allowed to participate in Telecom's
U.S.-bound calling business.

UNIVERSITY PLOTS BROADBAND NET -- Fiber To
Cambridge

    By MALCOLM LAWS

         CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND

   Next summer the medieval architecture of Cambridge will be networked by
one of Europe's most advanced broadband fiber optic communications
systems, thanks to Cambridge University.

   The 2.5 million ($4.7 million) Granta Backbone Network will offer
voice, data, image and video transmission for staff and students at 79
sites, most of which comprise the 31 semi-autonomous colleges that make up
the university.

   Because the university is spread throughout the city, lacking a central
campus, it was granted a special telecoms license by the Department of Trade
and Industry that allows it to lay its own lines for private voice and data
communications.

   A forthcoming government telecoms duopoly review could open the way for
Cambridge to sell commercial services, but the university would not speculate
on what might be possible.

   The GBN is part of Project Granta, a fourfold computing strategy approved
by the colleges in October 1987. The strategy comprises the University
Network, the mainframe, distributed computing and personal computer
systems.

   The colleges agreed on an outline for the backbone network in early 1989.
Implementation will start next month and is due to be completed by June. STC
plc's cable products division is to build the network.

   The GBN has been designed with a mix of present and future industrial,
social and educational needs in mind, according to the university.
Although regulations limit GBN use to within the university and its
various agencies, such as the Cambridge University Press and the local
schools examination board, ``if it were legal, decent and honest, we'd do
anything,'' said David Hartley, director of the University Computing
Service for 20 years.

   In anticipation of new services GBN has ``sufficient spare
capacity for increased and new forms of communication traffic where
needed,'' Hartley said.

   A copper coaxial cable and three types of fiber-62.5-micron and
50-micron multimode and a very-high-capacity 8-micron
monomode-will be laid in one duct and there are two more empty ducts.

   The copper cable will replace the digital leased lines now used for the
university's private X.25 network, linking more than 100 Ethernet
segments and for the private PBX voice network. Hartley estimates the GBN will
immediately save the university 70,000 a year just in replacing the leased
lines used for data.

   Uses for the various fibers have been left open. At first the 62.5
micron U.S.-standard fiber may support the 100-megabit-per-second fiber
distributed data interface local network technology, shortly to be
ratified by the American National Standards Institute. The 50-micron fiber
will carry Ethernet.

   Both may later support 140-mbps dual queue, dual bus metropolitan area
networking, for voice, data and video, once the standard has been finalized.
The 50-micron fiber, standard in Europe and Japan, has been chosen to
support applications that are still being researched, at Cambridge and
elsewhere.

   The 10-gigahertz bandwidth of the 8-micron fiber is so great that
even high-quality video could not fill it, said Andy Lawrence, director
of project analysis at Cambridge consultancy Improcom Ltd., which helped
design GBN. It has been installed in anticipation of applications several
years away.

`ASKING FOR THE MOON'

   In the short term the GBN could be used to carry satellite TV signals
received by the audio-visual services department.

    Lawrence said that what the university wanted ``was a bit like asking
for the moon,'' since, in Hartley's words, it needed a ``low-tech,
low-risk, long-term'' infrastructure. The dark fiber itself is seen as low
technology; it is the networking technology running over it that is high
tech.

   To save money, the bulk of which will be spent simply on laying cable, the
university's network will share duct space with the Cambridge cable
TV company. However, regulations do not allow the two to share cables. As much
of the ducting as possible will run across university land.

   Hartley emphasized that Project Granta is different from such ventures as
Project Athena at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which aims to
develop computer systems themselves.

   Instead, Granta is an exercise in how to manage corporate information
systems. Its infrastructure will provide both general and specific
applications, from electronic mail to communications for advanced molecular
biology.

    Stanford University, of Palo Alto, California, has signaled its intention
to participate in a medical school network that will link a group of
universities using the ISDN primary rate interface. Stanford joins Duke
University, Johns Hopkins Health Systems and Harvard University, which have
been negotiating with a number of long distance companies to use ISDN to link
the medical schools of each campus.

   The North American primary rate interface specifies 23 bearer channels and
one signaling channel, all operating at 64 kilobits per second. It provides
bandwidth equivalent to the T1 speed of 1.544 megabits per second, giving the
institutions the flexibility to transmit data, image and video. Image
transmission appears to have the most potent application in the med school
network.

   ``There's a great need internally and externally for each institution
to move radiographic images back and forth'' between offices and storage,
said Norman Sefton, assistant business manager and director of
communications at Duke, in Durham, North Carolina.

   Managing the X-ray database is a tremendous physical problem, Sefton
said. ``It would be nice if we could handle them like a jukebox-just call
them up and share the stored image for consultations or other uses,'' he
said.

First Union Banks On VSATs

    First Union Corp. has replaced its leased-line network with a
multimillion-dollar Ku-band satellite network that the bank expects
will help it save $4 million in communications costs over the next five
years.

   The very small aperture terminal network includes 646 earth stations that
link 723 bank sites.

   The company, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has bank branches and
business offices in 36 U.S. states. The network will carry all the
bank's data communications traffic, including that generated by its
automated teller machines. First Union also runs its network security alarms
on the VSAT network.

   The bank's voice traffic will remain on virtual-network
circuits provided by US Sprint Communications Co. and AT&T, said
George Mattingly, vice president and director of telecommunications at First
Union.

Forecast Calls For Ethernet

    The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, in Reading,
England, is to install a high-capacity Ethernet local area network later
this year to increase the accurancy of its daily forecasts.

   The organization produces weather reports for 18 European countries, using
a numerical model of the atmosphere.

   The new local area network, to be supplied by Untra Network Technologies,
of San Jose, California, will add to the ECMWF's existing Cray
Research Inc. supercomputer and its IBM 3090 mainframe. The organization said
it needs 1-gigabit-per-second data traffic capacity to match
data files of gigabyte size with giga-flop processor performance in a
distributed environment.

Developer Lures Business With Fiber

    By DAWN BUSHAUS

         DAKOTA DUNES, SOUTH DAKOTA-A real estate developer is counting
on a fiber optic communications network, coupled with a buyers'
market and a scenic environment, to lure communications-intensive
businesses to the self-contained city it is developing in Dakota
Dunes.

   Many developers and telephone companies across the United States are
experimenting with deploying fiber to businesses and homes. Dozens of
fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-curb trials are under way, and
businesses are beginning to demand services, such as videoconferencing and
high-speed data transmission, that are delivered best over the medium.

   Dakota Dunes Development Co., a division of Midwest Capital Group Inc., of
Sioux City, Iowa, is developing this 2,000-acre community at the
convergence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers, near Sioux City. It will
feature 1,600 residential units, a 216-acre business park, an
18-hole golf course and a $1.8 million fiber network.

   The Dakota Dunes project, which originated two years ago, is expected to
take 15 years to complete. The developer is targeting credit card, insurance,
computer and other communications-intensive companies as potential new
businesses for the community, said Glenn Ivarsen, manager of economic
development at Dakota Dunes Development. About 5,000 jobs can be created in
the business complex, he said.

   U S West Inc., of Englewood, Colorado, soon will begin deploying the fiber
optic network that will provide telecommunications service to the businesses
and residences in Dakota Dunes.

FIBER IN EVERY BUILDING

   ``We will be bringing fiber to every corporate hub site in each
new building, and we will also be bringing fiber to the curb for the
residences,'' said Don Faber, service manager for large
business services at U S West. ``We'll be letting bids
soon because we have to have fiber in to serve the first business
customer.''

   That first customer, Financial Reserve Corp., an East Haven,
Connecticut-based credit card company that targets college markets, is
expected to set up shop early next year.

   Keith Eaton, vice president of management information systems at Financial
Reserve, said the fiber network, along with the tax breaks offered in South
Dakota, played a role in the company's decision to locate an office
in Dakota Dunes.

   The site will support customer-service and collection operations,
which will require heavy use of both voice and data communications, Eaton
said. The company has not yet signed up for any specific telecoms services,
however.

   U S West's Faber said he expects business customers to use the
fiber network for high-speed data services, such as integrated services
digital networks, and for videoconferencing.

   For residential customers, the company initially will offer only plain old
telephone service, he said. Services such as remote meter-reading or
security monitoring may be offered to residential customers in the
future.

Developing World Looks To OSI

    By DAVID ROCKS

         NEW YORK-Though behind in the drive for Open Systems
Interconnection, developing countries face fewer barriers to adopting the
protocols than their industrialized counterparts, some experts say.

   Nearly 20 years after users first began clamoring for interoperability,
products following OSI protocols are finally becoming widely
available-but not so much in the developing world.

   ``OSI products will come, but how soon, we will see,'' said S.
Ramakrishnam of India's Department of Electronics. ``It is important that
we build up momentum with significant involvement by industry and users.''

   Still, once they get around to adopting open systems, developing countries
may face fewer barriers than developed countries, according to Ramakrishnam
and others.

   There may be more resistance to change in Europe, Japan and the United
States, where businesses already have a substantial investment in systems,
than in developing countries, which generally do not have an installed
proprietary base, said Kathy Dally, an OSI consultant with Omnicom Inc., of
Vienna, Virginia.

   Developing countries ``don't have extensive networks,'' Dally said.
``So instead of buying proprietary operations, they would be more likely
to buy the OSI solution.''

CREATING BELIEVERS

   Ramakrishnam said no vendors in his country sell OSI products, although one
of the 11 computer networks in India plans to use OSI protocols.

   The system, called Ernet, is a national network using very small aperture
terminals to link universities and researchers nationwide. Funded by the
United Nations Development Program, one goal of the project was to spur
development of OSI standards in India.

   ``We want to clarify the environment to make it easier for people
to become believers,'' Ramakrishnam said.

    Lincoln Faurer, president of the Corporation for Open Systems
International, a not-for-profit group based in McLean, Virginia,
that advocates OSI solutions, said developing countries-indeed all
countries-could gain more in terms of open systems if they were to put
aside nationalistic goals in favor of internationalism.

   ``Every country wants to spend the money at home to solve the problem
[of interoperability], but they don't have the money to really put a dent
in it,'' Faurer said. Instead of trying to develop indigenous standards,
he said, nations should work with international agencies for a global
solution.

   Such a global solution is a key concern of developing countries,
Ramakrishnam said. With different regions developing their own conception
of OSI, countries that are not part of one region must make a decision
about which regional standard to adopt.

   ``We have to choose between the United States, Japan and Europe,
and we don't like it, so harmonization is very important to
us,'' he said.

   Ironically, because of the untested nature of OSI, if developing countries
lag in its adoption, they might actually come out ahead, said John McConnell,
a networking consultant based in Boulder, Colorado.

   ``Whether OSI is going to work or ever be a commercial success is
something that we won't know for another several
years,'' he said.

Unisys Unveils Open Architecture

    By KELLY JACKSON

         NEW YORK-Unisys Corp. has unveiled a computer architecture for
building distributed networks out of its own and other
manufacturers' products.

   Unisys, of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, assembled its top executives in New
York earlier this month to announce its long-awaited blueprint for
building enterprise networks (CommunicationsWeek International, 17
September).

   The Unisys Architecture unifies the computer manufacturer's
divergent product families and melds them with other vendors'
products using international and de facto networking standards.

   Users and industry analysts hailed the new direction as a milestone.

   ``Unisys' architecture is a real solution. It's tangible and it's going
to prove to be the best option'' for many users, said Dean Sutton,
president of CUBE Inc., of Detroit, a Unisys user group.

   The Unisys Architecture, which includes the spectrum of technologies needed
to construct a multivendor network, also addresses network management. Unisys
officials offered clues to the company's plans for that area.

   James Murtaugh, vice president and general manager at the
company's Information Networking Group, said Unisys has decided to
add Simple Network Management Protocol network management technology to its
future management software under the Unisys Architecture umbrella.

   Next year the company will unveil its software based on the OSI Common
Management Information Protocol, using OSI/Network Management Forum
specifications, he said.

   Unisys officials said the company's architecture emphasizes
standards, not proprietary networking protocols and operating systems.

   While IBM's Systems Application Architecture and Digital
Equipment Corp.'s Network Application Support rely on proprietary
systems as the core architecture, the Unisys architecture provides a clear
migration path from proprietary to open systems, analysts said.

FINANCIAL WOES

   Officials unveiled the architecture about a week after Unisys announced
it would eliminate its 25-cent-per-share dividend-news that sent the
company's stock price plummeting.

   James Unruh, Unisys president and chief executive officer, said the company
will likely show a loss in the third quarter, but return to profitability in
the fourth.

   For the full year, however, Unruh was less sanguine about whether Unisys
will post a profit. He said the volatility of the economy, worsened by the
tenuous situation in the Middle East, makes it impossible to forecast earnings
with any degree of accuracy.

   Financial analysts were wondering if the new architecture would be enough
to offset damage caused by the discontinuation of the company's
dividend.

   Charles Rothchild, an analyst with Pershing & Co., in New York,
said Wall Street greeted the elimination of the dividend with ``a
great deal of disappointment.''

   ``This is a company that has paid a dividend for 95 years,'' he noted.
One day after the 27 September announcement to eliminate dividend payment,
Unisys stock tumbled some 23 percent, to $5.375 per share.

   Candee Wilde contributed to this story.

Novell Offers AS/400 Link

    By Kella Knack

         PROVO, UTAH-Novell Inc. has introduced a token-ring connectivity
option for NetWare, its local area network operating system, that expands
support for IBM Application System/400 midrange computers on NetWare LANs.

   Novell is the first third-party vendor to offer a token-ring
option for IBM equipment. It is being provided in Version 1.3 of NetWare SNA
Gateway Server software and Version 1.2 of NetWare 3270 LAN Workstation client
software.

   Numerous users have asked Novell for connectivity options over the past two
years, said Gerry Machi, director of product marketing at Novell. According to
Bruce Robertson, with Interconnect Network Consulting Group, of Santa Monica,
California, ``people assumed if they had IBM they could not use
Novell.''

   The SNA gateway software turns an IBM Personal System/2 PC into a Systems
Network Architecture gateway server, letting users on a NetWare LAN share a
token-ring link with an IBM 2/3X or AS/400 host. It costs $2,995.
The NetWare 3270 LAN software gives 64 LAN workstations access to up to 64
concurrent terminal/printer sessions on an AS/400. It costs $995.

Business Looks To Video

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         LONDON-Videoconferencing is becoming a more viable business
tool with developing international standards, breakthroughs in microchip
technology and the prospect of falling prices.

   Companies have used videoconferencing primarily for internal meetings.
Products hit the market in the mid-1980s, and there are now about 2,000
corporate studios worldwide, mostly in the United States.

   Norman Gaut, president of videoconference equipment manufacturer PictureTel
Corp., of Peabody, Massachusetts, said the industry has been U.S.-based
mainly because of the comparative price and quality of public networks
elsewhere. But network improvements, including the more widespread
availability of international ISDN, will make the market more global, he
said.

   Trans-Atlantic videoconferences cost several hundred dollars an hour.
They are not even possible between many countries because of a lack of
international public circuit-switched
64-kilobit-per-second services.

   Market growth has also been impeded by a lack of equipment standards, the
high cost of equipment and the large amount of bandwidth required to use
it.

   The transmission of broadcast-quality, full-motion television
pictures in digital form requires bandwidth of about 5.5 megahertz for
transmission speeds of between 90 megabits per second and 100 mbps. But
ordinary public telephone networks are designed to carry relatively
low-quality voice signals, which need only 10 kilobits per second, or a
bandwidth of 3.5 MHz. Therefore, video transmission requires compression.

   Video signals are also analog, which means they must be converted to be
transmitted over digital leased phone lines. The process of converting and
then compressing pictures is carried out by computers called
coder-decoders, or codecs.

   Codecs compress signals to as low as 64 kbps and to the T1 and E1 speeds of
1.544 mbps and 2.048 mbps. As a rule, the greater the bandwidth, the better
the picture quality. But more bandwidth also costs the end user more
money.

   George Newman, an analyst at International Data Corp., in Framingham,
Massachusetts, expects an increasing number of products to operate at around
384 kbps as a compromise between price and quality.

STANDARDS MEAN ACCEPTANCE

   Meanwhile, equipment manufacturers and users alike say standards will help
further the acceptance of products. Current systems are proprietary,
preventing users of one product from communicating with those of another.

   The first step toward standardization should take place in November, when
the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee is due to
ratify the H.261 video compression standard. GEC Plessey Telecommunications
Ltd. and Video Telecom Corp. say they already have compliant products; other
suppliers, such as PictureTel, Harris Video Communication Systems Inc. and
Compression Labs Inc., plan to make their products compliant next year.

   Standards will be applied only in part. H.261 is the video compression
element of a broader Px64 standard, which recommends speech compression for
video transmission at 64 kbps.

   Using so much bandwidth for voice is a waste of bandwidth, and also impairs
video quality. Consequently, many products will compress speech to 16 kbps,
while adhering to the CCITT's video-compression standard.

   Suppliers ultimately want videoconferencing products to be as convenient as
using a simple telephone. Widespread ISDN, which provides dial-up
64-kbps speeds, would facilitate such connectivity, and allow users to
make a video call for the price of a normal phone call.

VIDEOCONFERENCING OVER PC

   Some observers say videoconferencing over personal computers will one day
supplant the need for expensive codecs. Instead of needing special screens and
cameras, conferencing could take place in a PC built with videoconferencing
chips, and a miniature camera mounted on top.

   In August, PictureTel and chip maker Intel Corp. began developing
microprocessors-which will be available to any PC manufacturer-to
allow videoconferencing at the desktop.

   Harris Corp. formed Harris Video Communications in July and rolled out its
PC-based Anamix Personal Communications system, which links to eight
people in different locations. Users are able to simultaneously watch
full-motion images, listen to conversation and share graphics. The APC
costs $85,000 for three units and $200,000 for eight.

   With the system, users need a PC, which can also be supplied by the
company, a camera mounted on the PC, and a microphone/speaker attachment. It
compresses to rates between 64 kbps and 1.544 mbps.

   PictureTel's Gaut said before high-quality PC videoconferencing becomes
a reality, a new generation of chips must be developed. Intel is working
on a chip capable of one billion operations per second, compared to 40
million per second possible with current chips, he said.

   IDC's Newman predicts a mass market for multimedia PCs, carrying
data, graphics, video and speech within five years. The market, he said, will
be spurred by increased PC memory capacity and the availability of more
bandwidth, brought about by extensive deployment of optical fiber in the
public network.

   Video Telecom, of Austin, Texas, claims to have the only videoconferencing
product that already carries graphics and data. Its Conference System, which
costs about $45,000 per user, operates at between 112 kbps and 768 kbps
and can retrieve data from an on-board hard disk so that photographs,
slides and documents can be used as part of a videoconference. VTC supplies
two monitors, one for video, and the other for data, and a tablet that allows
notes or changes to be made to a graphic, seen in real time on the other end
of the videoconference.

   Not all potential users are sold on the concept of videoconferencing over
PCs. Deborah Scholl, assistant vice president of financial services company
First Chicago Corp., maintains that PC screens are too small for large
business meetings.

CUTS TRAVEL EXPENSES

    First Chicago has been using videoconferencing for a year between offices
in Chicago, New York and London. Scholl said the company's 57
conferences have saved it more than $17,500 in travel expenses over the
last five months.

   First Chicago's conferences are transmitted over the public
network at 112 kbps. PictureTel equipment accesses two 56-kbps circuits.
Though most meetings are for internal business or training, the company has
regular conferences with one of its West Coast clients.

   Scholl hopes public operators will offer bridging facilities to allow three
meetings to be linked, currently not possible with its PictureTel equipment.
Conferences involving three or more rooms are possible, but the equipment is
more expensive.

   Many telecoms operators already offer public booths. British Telecom, for
instance, has 11 public videoconferencing centers across the United
Kingdom.

   PictureTel's U.K. distributor held the first videoconference
between the United Kingdom and Australia last month. The video ISDN link was
carried by OTC Ltd., which has just begun international ISDN service to the
United Kingdom.

   Most European telephone operators offer videoconferencing. The first to
offer switched international video services was BT, in conjunction with
Teleglobe Canada Inc. in 1984. BT now offers such services to 17 countries,
and estimates that about 200 U.K. companies use videoconferencing on private
networks.

   Videoconferencing is attracting more attention despite high entry costs for
suppliers, particularly for research. Six year-old PictureTel, for
instance, is a leader in low-bit rate systems but is still unprofitable.
Before long, users will be able to choose from an increasing number of less
expensive products.

   What is unclear, however, is exactly how users will apply video
conferencing-whether with conventional codec-based products or a new
generation of multi-media PCs.

IBM's European Mouthpiece

    By ANNE-MARIE ROUSSEL

         Corporate lobbying of European Commission representatives was an
activity limited to a handful of players only a few years ago-and, at
that time, IBM's Olivier de la Fouchardiere was already a member of
the club.

   Since then, the practice has widened. But because of cultural differences,
professional lobbying is still not as well received in Europe as it is in the
United States.

   ``Lobbying still has a negative connotation in Europe,'' la
Fouchardiere says. Whereas lobbyists are registered professionals in
Washington, they have a more nebulous status in Europe, where the
political clout of special-interest groups or corporations is not
appreciated.

   La Fouchardiere, however, combats the European attitude with bravado:
``I love being called a lobbyist, it's the fun part of my job,'' he says,
adding he likes to use the power behind Big Blue to help shape the course
of politics in Europe.

   ``Coming from IBM, I never had problems getting appointments with top
officials,'' he says. Such influence seems particularly useful, now that
there are signs that the European ways are changing, he says. These days,
when he goes to Brussels to present IBM's viewpoint, ``there are several
hundred lobbyists representing interest groups or corporations waiting to
see officials, where there was no one before.''

   La Fouchardiere has a long history of representing IBM-in various
capacities. After joining the computer manufacturer 25 years ago, the
50-year-old engineer alternated for years between the
company's French subsidiary and IBM Europe, both based in Paris.

   Since last year he has overseen IBM France's standards programs
and its external relations.

   In the standards area, la Fouchardiere directs IBM's research and
development team, located in the southern French town of La Gaude, which works
with such bodies as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI) to develop Europe-wide telecommunications products.

   As director of external relations, he oversees IBM France's
relationship with the French government and the European Community. He
keeps abreast of laws or directives that may affect IBM's business in the
region, and tries to influence the law-making process by lobbying the
right people.

   His current crusade is with the French regulatory body, the Direction a la
Reglementation Generale. The DRG has prepared a draft legislation-to be
debated by the French Parliament this month-to reform the telecoms market
in France (CommunicationsWeek International, 17 September).

   As a potential supplier to possible service providers, IBM would prefer the
market to be as wide-open as possible, la Fouchardiere says.

    But as he sees it, the DRG's proposal needs more work, so he
would like Parliament to amend it.

   ``It's too complicated,'' he says. ``It creates categories of services
that don't exist.''

   These categories, identified in the proposal as ``support services,''
include certain data communication services, such as those offered by
packet-switched network Transpac or the integrated services digital
network. These data services are grouped by the licensing procedure they
require-an arbitrary process, said la Fouchardiere.

   ``There is no objective determination of where the category starts or
ends,'' he says, ``so potential service providers can't know whether they
are within the limits or not.''

   In addition, private datacom operators-which he says should
theoretically compete on equal footing with France Telecom-are actually
not considered on par with the national operator. While the law clearly
defines what private operators can or cannot do, there is no such definition
for France Telecom, giving the impression that France Telecom faces no
restrictions.

   ``If I were a private operator, I would very much like to know what
France Telecom can do to gobble me up,'' la Fouchardiere says. ``If France
Telecom wants to be a competitive market, then it should be submitted to
the same rules as anybody else.''

   Another shortfall of the DRG's law proposal, he argues, is there
is no provision for service providers to be included in the
decision-making process.

-    If la Fouchardiere could achieve one goal in Europe, it would be
this: that pan-European voice and data communications networks
would no longer be subject to geographical barriers.

   ``National frontiers get in my way,'' he says.

IN THE NEWS

    By Malcolm Laws

         3Com Corp. has named Richard Joyce, former managing director of its
U.K. subsidiary, as the company's first European president of 3Com
Europe.

   Effective last week, the new job means the 34-year-old Joyce will
work from the Paris headquarters of 3Com Europe. The first day in his new role
was spent at a networking exhibition in the Soviet Union.

   Joyce, who helped set up the U.K. arm of Bridge Communications Inc. before
it merged with 3Com in 1987, takes over from senior international vice
president John Marman.

   Marman has returned to 3Com corporate headquarters in Santa Clara,
California, after a year spent overseeing the shift in the company's
European organization.

   The European reshuffle got under way in 1989, when a group of 3Com's
General Europe Area management left to form their own company. Soon
afterward, responsibility for the smaller European territories, Africa and
parts of the Middle East-all previously in GEA-passed to the two major
subsidiaries, the United Kingdom and France.

   The non-European countries now come under 3Com Intercontinental and
the smaller European territories have become independent.

   Joyce says one of his next tasks is to open Eastern Europe to
3Com's networking products, hence the early Soviet visit. Tom
Plymouth, recently hired from Digital Equipment Corp., will become the new
U.K. managing director.

International Users Take Command

    By David Gillick And Denis Gilhooly

         Europe's telecommunications administrations remain
oblivious to the fundamental needs of national and international
telecommunications users.

      Inadequate standards, low quality of service, over-regulation,
limited product offerings, inadequate network management, and poor customer
relations are stifling business development across industry sectors, according
to the 1990 CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group International
User Survey.

   But evidence is mounting that the balance of power is finally shifting in
favor of the customer.

   Not surprisingly, the survey finds that users want basic, reliable and
affordable services at competitive prices. What is surprising, however, is
that, increasingly, users regard electronic information exchange-and the
effective inter-networking to allow the exchange to occur-vital to
many of their operations.

   They expect the basics, but they want more.

   Users can no longer afford to be held captive by monopolies reinforced by
outmoded regulatory regimes. To be competitive in a global marketplace their
needs must come first. Otherwise, like users in the United States 10 years
ago, those in Europe will seek alternatives.

   Telecommunications is now the central nervous system of a
service-based global economy based increasingly on the exchange of
electronic information. Electronic information exchange is the commodity that
will fuel economic growth into the 21st century.

INCREASING CHOICE

   Today, the spread of competition in Europe's most liberalized
markets has resulted in increasing choice in equipment and service offerings.
This new-found freedom is leading users to articulate their needs and
shape the development of a free marketplace.

   The lumbering telecoms administrations, slow to wake to the realities of
the marketplace, are responding in piecemeal fashion. Offerings such as
one-stop shopping are emerging.

   But these are not enough.

   The regulatory impediments against pan-European networking and tariffs
that are too high are forcing users to implement alternative solutions.

   One such alternative is very small aperture terminal (VSAT)
satellite operations which are a proven means of bypassing the fixed-link
network. Others may be emerging mobile radio services or even competitive
fixed networks.

ASTONISHING CHANGES

   Since the 1989 International User Survey, astonishing changes have been
witnessed. The Iron Curtain has collapsed: Germany has united; new
European institutions are emerging and old ones are forced to change;
monopolies, cartels and trade barriers are crumbling; competition and foreign
investment are being welcomed, not resisted; privatization of public holdings
is more commonplace; new international agreements, regulatory liberalization
and competition are exerting a forceful downward pressure on tariffs.

   In short, there is no turning back.

   These changes have helped users assume control of their own destiny. No
longer will they accept having to adapt to the dictates of monopoly service
providers. Now it is the suppliers who must learn to adapt. They must offer
real choice in their product and service offerings at internationally
competitive prices.

   The 1990 Survey confirms that telecoms has finally entered the boardroom.
An overwhelming number of telecoms managers now report to board members or
information technology directors.

   Users don't believe they are getting value for their money. With
the exception of facsimile, the vast majority of respondents rated telecoms
administration services as mediocre, on a scale of 1 to 5.

   For international communications, users' catalog of complaints
range from the lack of international standards to the fact that their needs
were being misunderstood.

IMPLICATIONS UNKNOWN

   However, while users recognize the potentially devastating effects of
network failure, in almost all cases the survey shows the cost of network
failure has not been calculated by users. Consequently, the full implications
are not known.

   At the grassroots level, and despite the European Commission's
terminal equipment directive, users in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium,
Spain and Germany remain concerned that regulatory restrictions on modem usage
are inhibiting their business.

   Increasingly, regulation covering mobile radio and satellite terminal
equipment is becoming a key concern.

   In terms of regulatory controls on service offerings, the biggest area of
concern among users is in the interconnection of private networks to the
public switched telephone network, an issue that is pointedly not addressed by
the Commission's framework for Open Network Provision across
Europe.

   This is closely followed by a desire to see a relaxation in the rules
governing the resale of spare capacity and satellite usage. Rules governing
cable television, mobile radio and electronic mail form a second tier of
concern.

   From the perspective of the service provider, the three areas that stand
out as being most affected by competition are mobile radio, leased circuits,
and packet switched data communications.

   In the burgeoning field of mobile communications, while almost 25 percent
of users are represented by high-level management, the survey found that
up to 30 percent of users of mobile communications are now employed in direct
sales. Cost remains the crucial issue in the uptake of mobile technology.

   Significantly, the survey revealed a decidedly low demand for international
roaming capability as embodied in the forthcoming pan-European digital
cellular radio network.

 TARIFFS MUST FALL

   Overall, though deregulation bodes well for a reduction in telecoms costs
it may be bad news for telecoms managers.

   The survey indicates an average salary level throughout Western Europe of
$40,000 a year. Switzerland again tops the salary poll, followed
closely by Spain and France-evidence perhaps that telecoms managers in
countries with a traditionally strong monopoly regime stand to gain the
most.

   In future, mobility and the ability to acquire new skills will be crucial
in the post-1992 deregulated market.
    The unmistakable message of the 1990 international user survey is that
telecoms tariffs must fall, and they must fall soon.

   More than 70 percent of respondents believe the move toward cost-based
pricing would have a major impact on their businesses. For voice, the
overwhelming demand is for cheaper international and long-distance calls.
For data, this criteria is matched only by the demand for lower usage
charges.

   For leased circuits, cheaper international and long distance charges is
matched only by demand for lower fixed costs. And for satellites, the general
desire is for cheaper tariffs and lower fixed costs.

   With a mounting downward pressure on international and long-distance
tariffs, what will determine the balance of power between the public telecoms
operators and users?

   And will that balance favor the use of public or private network
solutions?

   Clearly, the public/private network tradeoff for users will depend on that
user's volume of traffic and the concentration of traffic by route.
Increasingly, however, choice will be determined by the price of leased
circuits, in particular, relative to the public network and also by the value
assigned by the user to proprietary control, security, reliability,
availability, and response time.

   With tariffs falling, and leased circuits an increasingly attractive
option, the battlefield for the coming few years is therefore likely to be
over a relaxation of regulatory controls both on VSAT networks and for
private-to-public network interconnection.

How This Users Survey Was Conducted

    To compile the information for this study, CommunicationsWeek
International and PA Consulting Group sent out more than 5,700 questionnaires.
We received 317 responses, a healthy response rate of about 5 percent, upon
which we based our stories.

   Participants were asked to react to a series of questions by assigning
a numerical value from one to five, with one representing `not important'
and five representing `very important.'

   Marks in the range of two to four were most common, while extremes were
rare. In some cases, however, extreme marks came in waves as the
respondent unleashed a long line of `ones' for poor service or `fives' for
the desirability of cheaper tariffs and competition.

   The result, generally, is that users' desires appeared in shades of
grey.

   What we have tried to do is give meaning to those shades.

HOW IT BREAKS DOWN

   Generally, respondents used the questionnaire to comment on the things they
felt most strongly about-in some cases leaving other questions
unanswered. There is a striking consistency from country to country in the
completion rate for each major section in the questionnaire.

   Completion patterns fell into three broad categories:

   o People who tried to answer everything, failing only to evaluate those
services unavailable to them;

   o People who only answered the section which interested them
most-international telecommunications, security, encouragement of mobile
services and public service tariffing;

   o People who answered the minimum number of questions.

   The typical completion rates for the various survey sections were as
follows:

   o Management structure-60 percent;

   o Telecoms administration service/quality-10-45 percent;

   o International telecommunications-80 percent;

   o Security-90 percent;

   o Mobile services-55 percent;

   o Impact of national regulation-50 percent;

   o Telecoms administration concerns (telecoms administrations
only)-10 percent;

   o Impact of tariffs-55 percent;

   o Other factors-70 percent.

   THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SURVEY

   Working closely with the CommunicationsWeek International staff on this
project was PA Consulting Group, a leading international management and
technology consultancy based in London and with offices in 20 countries.

    As was the case with last year's survey, London-based John
Buckley, director, telecommunications, lead the PA team.

   The writers and researchers were David Gillick, manager, policy and
regulations, computers and telecommunications; Garry Garrard, manager, mobile
communications; Peter Jenner, business manager, security consultancy centre;
Michele Williamson, consultant, human resources; Michel Bensimhon, manager,
computers and telecommunications (France); Karl Schreiner, manager,
computers and telecommunications (Germany).

International Telecoms Needs -- Are Europe's
Users Ready To Go Global?

    By John Buckley

         Telecoms administrations and suppliers have a long way to go before
meeting European users' needs.

   Despite their efforts to improve their services, and despite the attempts
by international bodies to re-shape the regulatory and competitive
environment in Europe, the results of this year's survey by PA
Consulting Group, of London, and CommunicationsWeek International, like last
year's, show that users aren't feeling enough of an
impact.

   With high international tariffs also becoming a greater concern this year,
European users may find themselves losing out to competitors from other parts
of the world, particularly North America, where telecoms regulations are
flexible and the market is more competitive.

   PICKING UP THE PACE

      In the last 12 months, the member states of the European Community have
picked up the pace of establishing a truly pan-European market for
general goods and services.

   Not only are they completing preparations for the planned 1992 launch of
their internal market; they are also taking wider steps toward opening
cross-border trade with Eastern Europe.

   These moves, plus other developments in world trade, are extending the
horizons of European trading companies; many that had been content doing
strictly domestic business are now thinking of marketing on a global
basis.

   Not surprisingly, therefore, Europe's business community is finding
international telecommunications more and more important. After all, a
company's ability to communicate efficiently with customers, distributors
or subsidiaries in other countries can be crucial to its market
penetration, particularly in countries where it competes with local-based
companies enjoying shorter lines of communication.

   But are the international telecoms needs of these growing companies being
met?

   If not, what problems are they experiencing?

LACK OF STANDARDS CITED

   The 1990 survey shows that, despite the considerable efforts of
international bodies to develop common standards, European users consider the
lack of unifying standards to be the single largest obstacle to international
communications.  This was also the finding in last year's survey,
suggesting that whatever the progress on international standards, the impact
is not strong enough or fast enough for users.

   Close behind the complaints about standards comes criticism of the service
limitations of the telecoms administrations, with users in Spain and Poland
being the most critical, but with all European countries expressing
concern.

   Closely allied with this concern are complaints against regulatory
restrictions; feelings of users about telecoms administrations service
limitations and regulatory restrictions seem to be running stronger this year
than in last year's survey. This level of concern is due largely to
the fact that telecoms providers and regulators often do not keep pace with
accelerating advances in technology, thus competition from potential new
market entrants is often stifled.

    But it is also clear that users are becoming much better informed about
telecoms developments; they are increasingly aware of what is technologically
feasible and what is available in certain other countries, for instance in the
United States, but which may be denied to them through regulatory constraints
in their own country.

   An example is satellite communications, where European users have come up
against the inflexibility of certain administrations and other service
providers; whereas in North America similar problems can be solved by the
flexibility of two-way satellite services allowed under the very small
aperture terminal (VSAT) arrangements.

   Because of these types of difficulties, plus the globalization of their own
businesses, users feel a strong need for suppliers to offer serviceson a
global basis.

   Eastern European countries, of course, have a major task ahead of them
before they can offer good quality communications, either within their
countries or internationally, and already there is a great deal of activity on
this score in many of the countries concerned.

   The responses to the survey show that when European users were asked about
the quality of international communications, those in Eastern Europe tended to
be the most critical (though those in Yugoslavia were among the most
satisfied).

    Interestingly, the countries most dissatisfied with their international
telecoms also included Luxembourg, France, Finland and Switzerland.

   But whether in Eastern or Western Europe, the level of tariffs charged for
international telecoms is recognized as a major issue.

   When asked in the survey which kind of tariff reductions would affect the
way they used public telecoms services, users cited high international call
charges for both data and voice.

   With the changing face of Europe and the globalization of markets, the
European users' need for effective international telecommunications
is becoming increasingly crucial.

   And telecoms authorities have shown that they can bring change about
quickly when they really want to-for instance, in West and East Germany,
where administrations are working to integrate their services.

   As pressure mounts in Europe for improving the level of international
telecommunications, users clearly wish to see administrations, government
bodies and others bring these changes about quickly.

Price The Missing Element In Europe's Mobile
Market

    By Garry Garrard

         Although mobile communications service providers plan to offer an
increasingly wide range of new services and facilities in Europe in the next
two years, users say they would prefer lower prices.

   In fact, users in nearly every country surveyed by PA Consulting Group, of
London, and CommunicationsWeek International rate the prospect of lower
cellular costs more favorably than the industry's plans to introduce
GSM, PCN, Telepoint and DECT technologies.

   Lower equipment costs also outpolled such concerns as extended national
coverage, service quality, and provision of international roaming, data
services and smaller phone size.

   Cost was particularly an issue in the Benelux countries, Germany, Italy and
Spain, where competition and choice are limited and where prices are far
higher than the European average. But price was also a concern in Scandinavia,
where the mobile phone market has been liberalized for years.

   Only in the United Kingdom was equipment price not considered important,
but mobile phone equipment is often given away there, or sold at highly
discounted prices. U.K. users almost unanimously called for lower call
charges-even more so than German users, who pay more. This reflects high
penetration in the United Kingdom and the growing proportion of telecoms
budgets spent on mobile communications as usage seeps down to lower levels of
the company hierarchy.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

   There are more than three million cellular phone users in Europe, where the
market has grown nearly 60 percent in the past year, indicating buoyancy. But
clearly there is still room for growth in Europe's cellular market.
Will demand be spurred by the new services and improved facilities planned for
next year?

   These developments include GSM, a digital cellular service that will offer
integrated services digital network compatibility and international roaming;
personal communications networks, which will start in the United Kingdom in
1992, offering users new services, including some taking advantage of
smart-card technology; Telepoint, which is being adopted in many
countries using CT2 technology, and DECT, a new European standard for cordless
telephones which is currently in development.

   If the new technologies are to be successful, then use of mobile
communications must become more common. More than a third of the organizations
surveyed provide mobile phones only to senior management.

   Outside the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, most companies still regard a
cellular phone as a privilege or a status symbol, instead of a tool to
increase business efficiency or improve customer service. This attitude was
prevalent in the United Kingdom for some time after cellular was introduced,
but has now changed considerably.

EXTENDED COVERAGE

   A similar effect can be expected in other countries where penetration is
low, and there is limited awareness of the real benefits of mobile phones.

   Cellular networks usually start in major cities, with less populated areas
brought along gradually. The survey reflects the desire for national networks
to offer extended coverage, with users clearly refusing to accept
limitations.

   According to the survey, extending coverage was the top priority in France
and Italy, and an important issue in Spain. Even in Norway and Finland, where
population coverage is high, improvements would be welcomed, presumably in the
large, sparsely populated regions to the north.

   The speed of rollout of GSM coverage is specified in a memorandum of
understanding signed by all the European cellular operators. However, the
minimum requirements are modest compared even to that of current analog
services in France, Italy and Spain. It seems unlikely the GSM will be able to
compete seriously in the market unless the operators exceed their rollout
commitments considerably.

SERVICE QUALITY

   Service quality is another factor affecting basic mobile telephony that is
important to users, who find it frustrating when calls drop out or channels
aren't available when needed. Because U.K. cellular networks have
been heavily criticized for failing to provide adequate service, it was no
surprise to find that this is still an issue for U.K. users, even though
Cellnet, at least, has been publicizing that it is improving its
infrastructure.

   The strongest implied criticisms of service quality, however, come from
Sweden, where congestion in the Stockholm area can cause problems, as well as
Finland and Spain.

   The factors mentioned so far affect all basic telephony, but new features
or service upgrades were also investigated: International roaming, data
services and availability of smaller phones produced some unexpected
results.

   Conventional wisdom says demand for international roaming is small and
concentrated in the Benelux region. While the survey indeed shows a modest
requirement across Europe, only an average demand exists in Belgium and the
Netherlands. The strongest response came from Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Hungary!

   In Western Europe, Germany showed the highest level of interest, followed
by Portugal and Switzerland. Still, users rated roaming less significant than
price reductions.

   There is moderate interest in mobile data services everywhere, but
these receive low priority from most experienced users. Finland was the
only country with reasonable cellular penetration to highlight data as a
priority need. Other countries enthusiastic about data either had low
penetration (Spain, Italy and Portugal) or no service at all (Greece.)

   As cellular markets mature, and mobile telephones become widely accepted,
users recognize that most requirements are for simple telephony.

   The results of the survey have some clear messages for the success of GSM.
The pan-European digital cellular system has been developed with
comprehensive features.

COST TO USERS IMPORTANT

    Compatibility with ISDN, and the availability of international roaming,
are often quoted as the most significant features of the new system but
neither is likely to increase market growth to any great degree. Costs to
users will be far more important.

   It has been estimated that when the GSM system starts, infrastructure costs
will be 20 to 30 percent lower than for analog systems, and competition in
equipment supply can be expected to drive prices down even more as the system
matures.

    Operators will not be locked to a single manufacturer after they select
their initial supplier. If operators follow European Commission policy, and
relate tariffs directly to costs, users should gradually see the decrease in
network charges that they want, and the market will grow even faster.

   The complexity of GSM will make early phones large and expensive, compared
to analog versions. However, the survey showed that phone size was of little
concern, and in many countries GSM should have little problem competing with
analog mobiles-particularly in Germany, the largest potential market in
Europe.

   Reciprocal type approval, where a product approved for use in one country
will be accepted in other countries, allowing users to shop around, and volume
production will lead to rapid price reductions, and by 1993 or 1994, GSM
mobiles and hand-portables should be available throughout Europe at
reasonable prices.

   GSM has been seen as a triumph of technological cooperation. It is
undoubtedly true that great progress has been made, but it seems likely that
its real achievement will be political, by transferring the benefits of
competition and volume production to countries where it has been stoutly
resisted.

What Users Were Saying One Year Ago

    Users have found their voices.

   Increased competition throughout Europe, and the prospect of even further
liberalization, has empowered them-and with new and varied choices in
equipment and service offerings has come the leverage to make demands.

   This empowerment is clearly reflected in this year's
CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group survey.

   This year, users loudly articulated their needs-and their expectations
that these needs will be met.

   This is a change from last year, when survey respondents took a more
diffident approach, expressing their wishes from the position of the harried
professional left to contend with batches of problems foisted upon them by
manufacturers, telecoms administrators and even their own companies
(CommunicationsWeek International, 16 October, 1989).

   What follows is a summary of some of those wishes.

   o On spending:

   Users in all sectors surveyed foresaw greater outlays on communications,
with the service, transport and government sectors reporting an increase in
spending of more than 25 percent last year. In contrast, respondents from
finance companies expected to see only a 5 percent annual increase over
1988.

   Yet, even as overall spending was expected to rise, the proportion to be
spent on international communications was to grow, according to the survey.
Respondents predicted an average increase of 10 percent in international
communications spending between 1988 and 1989, with international
communications accounting for 35 percent of all spending in 1989.

   o On the telecommunications administrations:

   Users were generally content with the quality of service their telecoms
adminstrations provided. Switzerland, Finland and France were judged to have
the highest quality networks, while Italy was said to have the worst.

   Users did say they wanted standard international data network services with
quality network management and common tariffs-things that telecoms
administrations did not provide.

   o On facilities management:

   More than half of the telecoms professionals surveyed said they were likely
to adopt facilities management approaches for data communications by 1994.
There was also significant interest in outsourcing as a management tool for
voice networks.

   o On managed data network services:

   Last year's survey predicted that the importance of managed data
network service would grow 24 percent across Europe, with growth fastest in
the transport and manufacturing sectors in Norway, Sweden, Italy and the
United Kingdom.

   o On packet switching:

   The survey predicted that international public packet switching services
would become as important as international voice networks.

   o On public voice services:

   Public voice services were also expected to grow significantly in
importance while private voice networks remained at their 1989 levels of
importance.

   o On the integrated services digital network:

   Response to ISDN varied depending on where the question was asked. In the
United Kingdom, for instance, ISDN had lukewarm appeal, with only 46 percent
of the survey respondents saying they believe ISDN is critical to the
development of telecoms services and 46 percent saying it would be moderately
useful. In France, Belgium and West Germany, however, 70 percent of those
questioned saw ISDN as critical.

   o On electronic communications services:

   Respondents to last year's survey predicted that electronic
communications services would play an important role in their futures, with
public electronic mail, electronic data interchange and videoconferencing
rated as the fasted growing new technologies for international communications
users.

   o On open systems:

   Almost half of the users questioned last year predicted that Open Systems
Interconnection would oust IBM's proprietary SNA in the 1990s as the
most popular networking technology. Only 9 percent of the companies surveyed
felt that SNA would gain a dominant position.

   o On facsimile and telex technologies:

   Last year's survey showed that facsimile was as important to
companies as voice services, but demand was not expected to grow
significantly. As for telex, users predicted that it would soon become an
anachronism.

   o On barriers to international development:

   Lack of standards was deemed to be the single greatest barrier to
international development last year; this was closely followed by staff and
skill shortages, limitations of telecoms administration services, vendors not
understanding the needs of users, product limitations, regulatory
restrictions, inadequate network management and insufficient support for
business managers.

   o On human resources:

   Average salaries for telecoms staff in western Europe hovered around
$46,000; most managers in eastern European countries earned less than
$15,000 a year.

   Information systems managers were paid the least, averaging $39,000,
with network/operations managers earning only slightly more.

   The highest salary levels were found in the finance sector, with
respondents reporting an average of $53,000. Those in energy averaged
$46,000; transport, $45,000.

   Government salaries were said to be on a par with government, with averages
of $44,000.

   The biggest problem facing telecoms managers in private industry last year
was staff shortages. One-third of the respondents employed by governments
called staff shortages a major problem, while as many as 70 percent of the
respondents in other areas said there was a serious lack of workers.

   o Other points related by the human resources section of the 1989
survey include:

   Only one of every four managers reported to an information technology
director; telecoms managers were more likely to report to an operations
manager, administration manager or the finance department.

      Most telecoms professionals served more than 200 people, and about
$10,000 was spent each year on each person who uses telecoms
facilities.

Increasing User Anxiety Surrounds Data Security

    By By Peter Jenner

         With more and more businesses in Europe depending on third parties
to exchange information for them, data security is proving to be a significant
concern.

   This growing anxiety is reflected in results of the survey conducted by PA
Consulting Group, of London, and CommunicationsWeek International. Ninety
percent of the respondents answered the questions on security, easily the
highest response level for any of the subject areas the questionnaire covered.
(The next highest category was international telecommunications, with an
80 percent rate of response.)

    Probably the most significant outcome of the whole survey was the response
to the questions concerning availability. More than 80 percent of the
respondents admitted that they had no idea how much it would cost their
companies if their communications networks were to fail. Yet more than half of
those who had estimated the potential losses thought it would cost $1
million or more if the network collapsed.

   Such a result suggests that most managers still subscribe to the attitude
that ``it won't happen to me.''

   Confidentiality of information has always been the most prominent security
issue in the minds of managers and the survey confirms that this remains
so: Sixty-eight percent of the respondents said confidentiality was
their biggest headache.

CONFIDENTIALITY CRITICAL

   There are many cases where confidentiality is critical but an objective
analysis usually shows that they are in the minority. In most cases, an
objective assessment of risks to the business would clearly show that failure
to ensure the integrity of information, such as money transfers, or lack of
availability of data-for example, in process control-would cause
much more damage or direct losses than if someone were to feed at the
information.

   In other words, businesses are more worried about the hacker than they are
about maintaining and transmitting incorrect data.

    An example of the need for integrity in the finance sector was an
attempted 20 million fraud targeted at Mitsubishi International Finance
Corporation. The fraudsters tapped into EUCLID, the Eurobond information and
clearing service, using a home computer and modem and tried to divert funds to
a Swiss bank account. The attempt failed only because the staff at the bank
receiving the proceeds queried the transaction. A better-planned attempt
could have been more successful.

   One way of preventing this attempt would have been to check that the money
transfer request was valid, thus ensuring the integrity of the data.

   Concern over privacy has been growing over the past few years. Much of this
concern is directed towards the storage and processing of personal data in
computer systems.

GROWING CONCERN

   Each European country has a data protection law which, in spite of its
name, is intended to protect personal privacy and shield the public from what
is seen as an insidious threat, as vast banks of computer-held data
spread across the world. Such data might easily be incorrect or open to
abuse.

   The survey showed that companies in many sectors hear the message and are
giving the issue the attention it deserves.

   In the government, health and education sectors the most prominent concern
by far was confidentiality of personal and employment-record information.
But in some sectors-mostly retail and distribution-concern over
personal privacy was far lower, pointing to a lack of concern about
customers' information.

    Business managers do not seem to realize that data protection laws give
equal protection to the rights of the corporate individual as to the private
individual. Companies should recognize this deficiency and take care over who
holds information about them and their businesses.

   Conversely, despite the importance of confidentiality in the public
sectors, there was no recognition of the need to care about
customers' data, and in many cases no recognition of the existence
of customers.

NATURAL DISASTERS

   There are many stories of accidents and disasters that cripple
communications facilities and can cost millions. One of the more extreme was
the 17 October 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, which many businesses
survived without physical damage, but which made for very heavy financial
losses because their computers could not communicate with the outside world
long afterward.

    Less dramatically, many businesses realized how risky it is to depend on a
single supplier when British Telecom engineers went on strike in 1988.

   Another common cause of problems is bad capacity planning. An example of
this was the Companies Registration Office in the United Kingdom, which had 35
computing system breakdowns in seven months. Of these, two were due to loss of
power, two to operating system problems and 31 to network overload.

A Look At The Human Side Of Telecommunications

    By Michele Williamson

         Liberalization is not just about suppliers competing to provide the
best value equipment and services, it is also about jobs.

   As the market is freed across the continent, people, too, will compete for
better paying work with more status and improved working conditions.

   And as telecoms deregulation takes hold, and the European Community moves
toward economic unity, the job market will change. The post-1992 single
market will be as much about the freedom of movement of people as it will be
about goods and services.

    But Europe still consists of a patchwork of telecoms structures and
policies, from the centralized East to free-market West.

   And as such, the 1990 CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group
survey results confirm that there are vast differences in the perceived value,
importance and earnings of telecoms professionals from one country to the
next.

   Most telecoms departments are fairly small: Sixty-four percent
of survey respondents report fewer than 10 members and 81 percent are in
departments of fewer than 26. The vast majority-87 percent-report
directly to either an information technology director (45 percent)
or other board member (42 percent).

   Most of the 6 percent who belong to departments with 100 or more people,
work in the United Kingdom. That country, however, has more large companies
than most other Community states and this probably accounts for the
difference.

   Many senior telecoms managers and directors reached their position through
experience and not through formal education, starting their working careers as
juniors in telecoms or with the armed forces as radio operators, or with the
national telecoms administration.

   But this is changing. Formal training-in business as well as
technology-is becoming more important among the newer generation of
would-be managers. Developing more slowly, the world over, is higher
education in communications. Compared with the United States, which has
pioneered higher education in business and telecommunications, Europe can only
offer a handful of MBA-type courses.
    The survey found that the highest paid professionals are not found in the
most liberal regime, the United Kingdom, where the average telecoms
professional salary is under $40,000 a year, but in monopoly markets
such as France and, in particular, Switzerland, where the average salary is
more than $60,000. Switzerland, whose telecoms professionals are paid
three times as much as their Polish colleagues, also dominated last
year's salary league table.

COMPETITION PLAYS ROLE

   This, too, could well change as competition takes over. Although
competition is not the only factor that determines salary levels-pay
scales are consistently higher for all industry sectors in certain
countries-it could play a significant part in an open, mobile employment
market.

    Apart from differences in the telecoms markets themselves, the cost of
living varies enormously from one country to another, and there are different
national pay customs and cultural factors. In some countries, employees are
paid extra if they work outside normal business hours. Salaries vary not just
between countries but according to business sector.

   The tremendous salary range from one industry sector to another in the
United Kingdom, for instance, is clearly seen in the results of PA's
1990 Survey of Employment Trends in Telecoms. A network technician could earn
12,200 in the manufacturing sector, up to 17,300 in the financial industry; a
telecoms manager would make 25,600 in manufacturing and 31,000 in
finance.

   These variations reflect such factors as the employer's level of
investment in technology and the relative importance of telecoms in a
particular business.

THE CHALLENGE AHEAD

   Countries on the threshold of deregulation and new technology can
potentially reap the benefits of skills and solutions developed by the
pioneering countries. But countries that deregulate early face the prospect of
losing their valuable skills to these``developing'' countries.

   This is both a threat and an opportunity, and it will grow as 1992
approaches and as Eastern Europe opens up. For example, skilled U.K.
telecoms specialists, earning only around $40,000-an average sum by
European standards-may be well-placed for comparatively well-paid jobs in
newly liberalized regimes, provided they have the necessary language
skills and can adapt to a new country.

   On the other hand, telecoms professionals whose security may be threatened
by the coming deregulation must be prepared to welcome change and to work with
colleagues from other national backgrounds.

   Just how significant this movement of the skills base will be remains
to be seen. Some people now predict that as equipment becomes more
complex, but user friendly, user organizations will need smaller numbers
of better-qualified technical people and fewer low-level operators.

   The role of the European telecoms professional is on the verge of changing
along with the move to a new Europe. Since the nature of that change is
uncertain, posing a mix of both opportunity and threat, the chances that
personal and economic circumstances will be affected are enormous. The
question is, how much will inertia hinder the revolution?

'MOTHER OF ALL CONCURRENT EDITORS' DEBUTS

Researchers at the University of Florida (Gainesville) may have solved one
of the thorniest problems of distributed computing--how to give multiple
users access to the same file without having one user overwrite another's
work. The researchers have developed a word processor called The Mother of
All Concurrent Editors (MACE) that saves changes by locking only a portion
of the file. MACE works across TCP/IP networks as well as single systems.
Here's how it works: When a user calls a document, it appears on screen,
along with the names of other users working on that same document. To make
changes to the document, users lock the portion of text they are working
on. These locks are managed centrally, so that all other users are aware of
them. Other users can watch the locked text change, but they cannot
interfere. When the writer saves changes, the locks are relinquished, and
other users can access that text. MACE isn't the first concurrent editor,
but it is much larger in scope than its predecessors. It also has an open
architecture to which other applications can be added.

WELLFLEET'S STAR RISES; CISCO SNUBBED

Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) is still easily the leading vendor
of routers, but Wall Street analysts have taken note of recent inroads made
by Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.). In September, Goldman
Sachs (New York) issued a bulletin downgrading its opinion of Cisco from
''fairly valued'' to ''fully valued,'' while simultaneously reiterating its
attractive rating of Wellfleet stock. ''We think Cisco's stock is not
likely to rise further and may decline,'' the bulletin stated. Goldman
Sach's positive assessment of Wellfleet is based in part on the company's
announcement that the three major long-distance telephone companies--AT&T
Network Systems (Morristown, N.J.), US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas
City, Mo.) and MCI Telecommunications Corp. (Washington, D.C.)--had all
signed contracts to purchase Wellfleet products for use and resale. ''This
represents a major endorsement of Wellfleet's architecture over its
competitors by a sophisticated evaluation trio,'' the Goldman bulletin
said.

VITALINK, NSC FORM R&D, MARKETING STRATEGIES

The merged companies of Vitalink Communications Corp. (Fremont, Calif.) and
Network Systems Corp. (NSC, Minneapolis) have hammered out their marketing
and product strategies. NSC's host connectivity products will be largely
unaffected by the merger. Research and development for each company's
routers will remain separate, while all marketing will be handled by
Vitalink under the leadership of its chief executive officer, Les Denend.
The router lineup will consist of Vitalink TransPath routers and TransLAN
bridges, NSC's 6000 Series routers, the 4000 Series of SNA connectivity
products from Netlink Inc. (Raleigh, N.C.) (see ''SNA, LAN, and DEC Traffic
on One Backbone,'' New Products/Internetworking, page 135), and the 8000
Series of connectivity products from Coral Network Corp. (Marlborough,
Mass.). Although the 8000 and 6000 Series overlap in some respects, the
Coral router has unique capabilities including fault tolerance, and support
for networks made up entirely of T3 or other high-speed communications
lines, Denend says. Future research and development efforts will center
mostly on 6000, 4000, and 8000 products, rather than on Vitalink's TransLAN
and TransPath products. Enhancements to the Vitalink products will involve
code upgrades and connectivity options such as frame relay, but the
architecture and capabilities will not undergo any fundamental changes or
be the basis for future products.

FTP DEVELOPERS PREFER OS/2 TO WINDOWS

Writing for Windows is like walking on thin ice, while OS/2 is a
developer's dream, at least according developers at FTP Software Inc.
(Wakefield, Mass.), which last month introduced a Windows and OS/2 versions
of its TCP/IP software, called PC/TCP. The developers say Windows crashes
if an application doesn't behave perfectly and is extremely difficult to
debug. Worse, they add, is the fact that Windows lacks many needed
facilities for communications applications. There's no way to share I/O
between multiple processes, no queuing system, and no way for DOS
applications to open device drivers at the same time. FTP had no choice but
to build all the necessary facilities itself. In contrast, the OS/2 version
of PC/TCP was a breeze to develop, the company reports.

LOW-END NICS SALES REMAIN STRONG

High-end 16- and 32-bit network interface cards (NICs) may grab the
headlines, but their sales don't come close to those for good old-fashioned
8-bit NICs, according to Lisa Alloca, senior product manager for desktop
products at Racal-Datacom (Sunrise, Fla.) and Bob Jones, director of
communications products at NCR Corp.'s Microelectronics Products Division
(Fort Collins, Colo.). The two companies last month introduced a jointly
designed Ethernet chip set and a Racal Ethernet NIC that uses the chip set.
''We've been waiting to kill off our line of 8-bit NICs for years now,''
Alloca says. She adds, however, that 8-bit NICs still account for 50
percent of all sales.

SPRINT TO LAUNCH FRAME RELAY SERVICE

US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas City, Mo.) says it will launch its
frame relay service starting next month. The company says it has been
beta-testing the service, announced last fall, with the accounting firm of
Ernst & Young. Once it is generally available, users will be able to access
the service at 56-kbit/s, fractional T1, and T1 speeds. Sprint also will
offer a more expensive ''reserved'' service, under which customers will
always have access to a given amount of bandwidth. Standard service does
not include the guaranteed-bandwidth feature, and is priced comparably with
other frame relay services, Sprint says. Reserved service will be priced on
a monthly rate, while standard services will include both fixed and
usage-based components.

BABY BELLS START FRAME RELAY TRIALS

Pacific Bell (San Francisco) and Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. (St.
Louis) have both announced frame relay trials to begin this year.
Southwestern Bell says it will launch a general offering in early 1992;
Pacific Bell wouldn't commit to an offering, but says it is examining the
service in the context of real-world applications. Both sets of trials are
for 56-kbit/s and T1 (1.544-Mbit/s) rates. Both companies also are
considering Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) technology, and
Pacific Bell says it will offer SMDS in early 1992, pending approval by the
California Public Utilities Commission..

FRAME RELAY AT 45 MBIT/S

Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) recently added support for frame
relay protocols at 45-Mbit/s to its internetworking routers. The frame
relay support is available as part of the company's X.25/Packet switch
software, which runs on an AGS+ router equipped with a high-speed serial
interface (HSSI)/T3 interface card. Depending on the router chassis size,
the software costs $750 to $3,200.

LOOK MA, NO LAN: SOFTWARE GAINS MORE OPTIONS

Concurrent Controls Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.) is adding more
connectivity options for its flagship Concurrent DOS software. The product,
an operating system that allows multiple users to share DOS and Windows
applications on one 386-based PC via terminal emulation. Concurrent DOS
costs $795 for a five-user package, which the company says is cheaper than
adding a LAN segment. The company plans to add support for multiple Novell
server sessions in the first quarter of 1992. Presently, Concurrent DOS
users on one PC can communicate with one NetWare server. Token ring and
Unix support are scheduled for the third quarter of 1992, the vendor says.
Concurrent DOS already contains hooks for use with Netbios application
development tools, such as ZIM from Zanthe Information Inc. (Ontario,
Canada). It also has hooks for communications packages that deploy Netbios,
particularly for communicating from PC to hosts. Concurrent DOS supports
all DOS and Microsoft Windows applications, including paged interrupt
applications that address PC serial ports, single-user
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs, and Microsoft's CD-ROM
extensions. It comes with electronic-mail and remote access capabilities,
security features, file transfer utilities, and a job scheduler that runs
unattended file transfers.

FRAME RELAY
CONGESTION MANAGEMENT:
TOO MANY OPTIONS?

By:
Nick Lippis

No matter if a network carries data, voice, or video, congestion management
is--or should be--a constant concern. And congestion management can be
boiled down to two basics: avoidance (staying out of trouble in the first
place) and recovery (getting out of the trouble you should have foreseen).
    It's not exactly brain surgery, but too many network planners and
managers still think the best way to eliminate congested links is to throw
more bandwidth (and money) at the problem. When it comes to bursty,
unpredictable internetworking traffic, though, congestion management starts
to resemble a fine art.
    The whole attempt to interconnect high-speed LANs via relatively
slow WANs presents some particularly thorny congestion problems. Part of
the trouble can be traced to the fact that computer network architectures
and telecommunications infrastructures evolved separately, so there's a
disjuncture in the way each discipline approaches congestion management.
The new virtual data services--like SMDS and frame relay--now being jointly
developed by the telecom and computing industries should go a long way
toward closing this traditional gap. But questions have been raised all
along about frame relay's congestion management abilities.
    It's true that frame relay's streamlined protocol stack reduces by
about two-thirds the processing overhead associated with X.25, the chief
alternative for public packet-switched service. But it's also true that
this streamlining means frame relay doesn't offer any of X.25's congestion
management techniques (error correction and detection, for example). When
frame relay networks reach a certain congestion threshold, the frame relay
switches start to drop packets. If the congestion becomes severe enough,
the network can collapse.
    The chief cause of this congestion is the way in which connections
are made to a frame relay network, usually via an internet nodal processor
(INP), such as integrated bridge/multiprotocol router, rather than the dumb
terminals used with X.25. For every INP, there are typically 100
end-systems (some combination of PCs, workstations, and minis) pushing
packets onto the network, which quickly adds up to a pretty hefty load.
    It's not that frame relay is without any form of congestion
management. In fact, the American National Standards Institute's ANSI
T1.618 spec addresses this issue.
    The trouble is, congestion management for frame relay is optional,
even though ANSI has defined several approaches. To date, there's no
consensus among vendors and carriers as to who will support which
alternatives.
    ANSI has specified two congestion notification bits in the frame
relay header: forward explicit congestion notification (FECN) and backward
explicit congestion notification (BECN).
    The FECN bit is set when a packet passes through a congested frame
relay switch. It's up to the INP to read the bit and notify the logical
network (DECnet, TCP/IP, IPX, AppleTalk) that it's time to throttle back on
the number of packets being sent.
    This type of congestion avoidance is a natural for connectionless
protocols that use the receiver end of a link for congestion management. In
essence, once it has been notified that the FECN bit is set, all a logical
network need do is reduce the size of the window that defines the number of
packets that can legally be sent onto the frame relay net.
    But there's a catch: Most of today's peer-to-peer protocols do not
support the FECN bit (the chief exception being DECnet Phase V/OSI). The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), for instance, has yet to define the
one bit in the IP header that would allow it to recognize FECN. It's not a
matter of technology: The IETF, like the CCITT, can do no more than
recommend FECN; it's up to the various IP communities to implement it.
Since the FECN bit by definition limits traffic, considerate users of a
network (who work with FECN to reduce congestion) could potentially lose
out to more selfish networkers who keep pushing packets even when
congestion is present.
    The BECN bit, in comparison, informs the source rather than the
receiving end (INP) about congestion. It's thus suited to terminal-to-host
protocols like SNA that use the sender side of the link for congestion
management.
    ANSI also specifies a third congestion-avoidance mechanism,
Consolidated Link Layer Management (CLLM), which uses a reserved data link
control identifier (DLCI) to send link layer control messages to an INP.
In effect, this is an in-band signaling channel that establishes and
identifies the causes of congestion. To date, it has garnered virtually no
support from vendors.
    All of the foregoing are so-called explicit congestion control
mechanisms. It also is possible to use implicit congestion management,
based, for instance, on delays. Thus, both TCP/IP and DECnet Phase IV nodes
monitor the elapsed time between when a packet is sent and when an
acknowledgment is returned. If no acknowledgment is received within a
specified period, the node first stops sending altogether and then slowly
begins to put packets onto the network, watching to see if they are
acknowledged.
    The ANSI spec also addresses congestion recovery with the Discard
Eligibility (DE) bit. This furnishes a way to identify a permanent virtual
circuit (PVC) on a frame relay network that is causing congestion. If a PVC
exceeds its allotted burst rate (defined when the network is set up) over a
specific period, the frame relay switch sets the DE bit. If the network
starts to experience congestion, it will first drop packets that have the
DE bit set.
    The carriers also are looking to help control congestion with the
Quality Of Service (QOS) definition they supply with frame relay offerings.
A QOS comprises a burst rate, access speed, maximum number of PVCs, and
Committed Information Rate (CIR), the last of which ensures that every
permanent virtual circuit always receives its specified bandwidth.
    There is another--and some might suggest harsher--way to deal with
PVCs that flood a network with packets: Set up tariffs that severely punish
unfair or dangerous network behavior. None of the carriers have chosen this
approach--yet.
    Unfortunately, all of these strategies remain options. So what's a
network planner to do? The most important guideline is to choose an INP
vendor and carrier or frame relay switch supplier in tandem. Make sure that
one knows about and supports the other's approach to frame relay congestion
management. This may soon be simpler than it sounds: There's a growing
trend for carriers to enter into nonexclusive arrangements with INP
vendors. Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.) now has such
arrangements with AT&T, MCI, and US Sprint. Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park,
Calif.) has cut deals with CompuServe, AT&T, and WilTel.
    Right now, frame relay users should expect to see packet loss on
the order of 1 percent to 2 percent of the total sent, pretty much in
keeping with any robust, fully utilized network. It's highly unlikely that
public frame relay networks will collapse as a result of congestion--as
long as the protection afforded by the DE bit is carefully adhered to and
INP vendors implement a range of implicit and explicit management
techniques.

NET MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS: A GOOD PLACE TO START,
A BAD PLACE TO STOP

By:
Bruce Fram

Standards for network management protocols are the mom and apple pie of our
industry. But what isn't clear to many users--and isn't talked about by
many vendors--is what protocols and standards can't do. This isn't
an indictment of any particular protocol--SNMP, OSI, CMIP, NMVT, or the
like. But net management protocols--standard or otherwise--don't address
the entire management issue.
    The truth is, they don't even deal with its most critical aspects.
Network management involves more that just passing information between
devices, which is the role of the protocol. A complete solution also must
encompass the user interface, database models, and application program
interfaces (APIs).
    Yet instead of working on all these issues in concert, many vendors
are content to deliver products that boast pretty interfaces or to supply
protocols bereft of real applications or hooks into other applications. For
instance, of the 40 or so simple network management protocol (SNMP)
management stations on the market, most give users no more than simple
statistics without interpretation. Their big selling point seems to be that
they support one or more of the leading management protocols.
    Beyond nifty graphics, what's needed are databases of information
about network topology, traffic, performance, status, and the like. I'm not
talking about the management information bases (MIBs) for SNMP or the
common management information protocol/services (CMIP/
CMIS). These are meta-definitions or specifications for device-level data.
    At least, I don't mean just that data. I'm also referring tothe
network-wide information that a complete net management system or
application would use. That data is available, although getting at it means
capturing and analyzing packets, which requires the management system to
run some fairly complex calculations.
    But even if a system collects this data, consolidating it, storing
it, representing it, and making it available for reports and further
analysis requires an underlying database far beyond anything typically
available. What's missing are well-defined specifications that actually
spell out the structure of the database and specify the elements it will
contain. For instance, how will routers be represented? How often will
network utilization data be collected? If packets per second are to be
monitored, will they be data packets or broadcast packets?
    The ultimate form a net management database takes will vary
according to need and configuration. But the database and the system it
serves should be able to identify and explain faults in detail and let
users know what corrective action has been taken. What users really want
are reports and suggestions to help with capacity planning and network
design. The last thing they want is to sit in front of a monitor scrolling
through screens of data.

DON'T WAIT FOR DME

    Without common database definitions, vendors and users are severely
limited as to the network management applications they can write. Yet these
applications are the heart of network management: They're what the
interfaces, databases, and protocols exist to serve.
    That's where APIs come into the picture. By giving developers
something common to write to, they make it far simpler to write multivendor
management applications. But developers of net management APIs face
problems familiar to all software engineers: They need standards and
specifications to guide them. If it sounds circular, it is: Developers of
standard APIs themselves need clearly defined standards. Only when both
pieces of the puzzle are in place can third parties and network managers
create truly useful applications.
    The Open Software Foundation (OSF, Cambridge, Mass.) may have an
answer in its Distributed Management Environment (DME). But it's too early
to tell if its recently selected technologies will do the job or if many
net management vendors will support it. And what will happen to existing
vendor APIs is an open question.
    Meanwhile, users desperately need ways to manage multivendor
distributed networks--today. It's time users began putting the pressure on
vendors for network management tools that fit together and do the job. If
they don't vote with their pocketbooks, they'll pay the price downstream.
    For their part, vendors need to start developing
protocol-independent, value-added applications. Graphical maps make for
great demonstrations, but most don't have the depth to back those first
impressions. We need to begin defining standards for user interfaces,
database models, and APIs--as well as for management protocols.

HSSI SIZZLES
But distributed bandwidth demonstrates
there's more to the high-speed serial interface
than just speed

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Now that far-flung LANs and mainframes regularly communicate with distant
sites and data centers, network managers are increasingly concerned that
interfaces to the wide area are becoming bottlenecks, costing them speed
and bandwidth. Router, multiplexer, and channel extender suppliers say they
have an answer in HSSI, the high-speed serial interface that's now starting
to appear in products.
    According to HSSI advocates, such interfaces as V.35 and RS-422
aren't fast enough to connect multiple LANs and mainframe channels at full
speed to T3 access devices. A T3 pipe delivers 45 Mbit/s of bandwidth;
Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) and the Synchronous Optical
Network (Sonet) will be even faster. V.35 was originally intended to
support no more than 6 Mbit/s, and RS-422 tops out at 10 Mbit/s.
    HSSI, as its boosters to point out, operates at up to 52 Mbit/s.
Perhaps even more importantly, it gives users a way to allocate all the
available bandwidth as needed among HSSI-compliant data terminal equipment
(DTE)--computers, routers, channel extenders, peripherals, and so on. These
devices are connected to HSSI multiplexers or channel/data service units
(CSU/DSUs), which in turn establish links to the wide area.
    Although no one device is likely to need the full bandwidth of,
say, a T3 pipe, HSSI makes it possible to allocate the T3's 45 Mbit/s among
different DTE. V.35 and RS-422 are not designed to allocate bandwidth. For
instance, a single HSSI port on a T3 multiplexer could support six router
connections. In contrast, six V.35 interfaces would be needed to link the
same six routers.
    HSSI defines a physical and electrical interface between DTE and
data communications equipment (DCE). It was originally developed by Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) and T3plus Networking Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.). The two vendors submitted it to the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) TR30.1 committee about a year ago. TR30.1 also developed
EIA-232 and V.35. HSSI's ratification is expected sometime in 1992,
according to members of TR30.1. They say the HSSI specification is not
likely to be changed significantly between now and its adoption. A number
of vendors already support HSSI, and more are expected to sign on (see
table).
    Changes in the way LANs and mainframes are used--and in the way
that the local area is viewed--are driving HSSI's acceptance. Database
systems, for instance, commonly require exchanges to take place over the
wide area as fast as if the communicating computers and resources were
located on the same physical LAN. Only a high-speed service such as T3 or
Sonet in conjunction with HSSI lets LAN speeds be maintained fully.
    What's more, as companies consolidate data centers, high-speed
links are needed to tie in mainframes at remote sites, says Richard Farmer,
product manager at Adaptive Corp. (Redwood City, Calif.). He also notes
that remote backup computers used during disaster recovery need high-speed
links to the data center.
    Also pushing HSSI along is the growing use of high-speed storage
devices, such as disk farms and tape silos (large rooms filled with
computer tapes that are accessed by robots in response to requests from
computers). This sort of storage demands high-speed mainframe channel
extension, according to Walt Hinton, product manager at McData Corp.
(Broomfield, Colo.). Mainframe operating systems that allow multiple
computers to work as one, such as IBM's Enterprise Systems Architecture
(ESA), also mandate high-speed links, he adds.
    HSSI's strong suit is distributed bandwidth. McData's 5300 HSSI
System, for instance, allocates user-specified portions of the T3 pipe to
each router, printer, and host (see Figure 1). Thus, the 5300 at Site B
allocates 10 Mbit/s to the router, 24 Mbit/s to the remote disk farm, 6
Mbit/s to the printer, and 2 Mbit/s to the PBX.
    The 5300 consists of a T3 multiplexer with HSSI interfaces and a
channel extender housed in the same cabinet. The channel extender, used in
this case to support the disk farm and printer at Site B, is connected to
the T3 multiplexer through the latter's HSSI interface. The router and PBX
at Site B also are connected to the multiplexer's HSSI interfaces.
    Specifically, HSSI makes it possible to allocate bandwidth by
establishing how routers or other DTE accept clocking from an external
source at speeds ranging from 1.5 to 52 Mbit/s. Network clocks are
typically derived from a central source (usually a clock maintained by the
providers of public network services) and passed along to all devices on a
network so that the beginnings and ends of blocks, messages, and frames can
be identified clearly.
    In most vendors' implementations of HSSI, bandwidth must be
allocated manually by the network manager to the devices connected to the
DCE. In fact, HSSI does not now specify a way for bandwidth to be allocated
dynamically.
    Dynamic allocation is obviously desirable because it eliminates the
work associated with specifying how much bandwidth a router or channel
extender is to receive. More importantly, it improves network performance
by accommodating bursty applications and users who come on-line with
bandwidth-hungry applications without warning.
    Some vendors, such as Newbridge Networks Inc. (Herndon, Va.), have
devised proprietary schemes that allow their HSSI multiplexers to allocate
bandwidth dynamically. Newbridge uses simple network management protocol
(SNMP) messages to enable routers and channel extenders to signal
multiplexers that additional bandwidth is needed. Most vendors agree,
however, that it makes far more sense for HSSI's backers to work together
to extend HSSI or devise a standard approach to dynamic allocation.
    HSSI also does not specify how multiplexers or similar devices are
to transmit data over the wide area. Most vendors' equipment gathers data
from attached networking gear and sends it as one DS-3 stream over a public
data service. DS-3 specifies 44.736 Mbit/s; T3, Sonet, and SMDS all accept
DS-3 as an input.
    When configured in a mesh network, multiplexers typically send the
DS-3 stream over the best possible route available at the time of
transmission. If that route fails, the data can be rerouted onto another
network link that furnishes a path to the destination.
    Once the DS-3 stream arrives at the receiving DCE, it is broken
down and specific data is sent to the appropriate devices (hosts, channel
extenders, routers, printers, PBXs, disk farms, and the like).
    Adaptive and T3plus have taken this basic approach one step
further. They allow data streams from individual devices connected to the
same HSSI interface to be routed to different destinations, over both T1
and T3 communications lines.
    Adaptive has implemented HSSI for its Sonet Transmission Manager,
or STM (see Figure 2). The switching facility maps a data stream coming
from a HSSI interface into multiple DS-1 channels. DS-1 specifies
1.544-Mbit/s transmissions.
    The STM's matrix switch can either combine DS-1s to transmit a DS-3
data stream or transmit separate DS-1 channels over multiple T1 lines
rather than one T3. In the latter case, the DS-1s are reassembled into a
DS-3 by the receiving STM, so data can be routed through the receiving
STM's HSSI interface to the appropriate device.
    Adaptive's and T3plus's ability to use multiple low-speed lines to
form a high-bandwidth link between two nodes gives users three additional
benefits. First, it allows network nodes to be installed in areas where
high-speed facilities may not yet be available. Second, it adds fault
tolerance, since more links can be established between nodes. Priorities
also can be established among HSSI connections to ensure immediate
recovery in the event of a network failure.
    Third, any one HSSI port connected to the STM's matrix switch
actually has more bandwidth available than would be provided by a single
DS-3. For example, it is possible for a router and host to be connected to
a remote router and host over both a T3 and a T1 line. Together, the T3 and
T1 deliver more bandwidth between two STMs than would a single T3. The
bottleneck in an STM network thus becomes the HSSI interface itself rather
than the T3 line.
    HSSI's place as the preferred interface to high-speed
communications lines seems secure. But not everyone is sold on HSSI. Some
vendors point out that although it was originally designed for 6-Mbit/s
transmissions, V.35 can be pressed into faster service.
    Network Systems Corp. (NSC, Minneapolis), for example, uses V.35
interfaces in its supercomputer connection equipment and routers to provide
access to T3 transmission equipment at up to 40 Mbit/s. ''There is no
advantage to HSSI over V.35,'' asserts Bill Way, product marketing manager
at NSC.
    HSSI proponents disagree. While it's true that multiple V.35s can
be made to access T3, HSSI provides better electrical characteristics,
according to Jim Michaels, vice president of network planning at
Newbridge.
    Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.) intends to support
HSSI but doesn't believe the interface offers real benefits today. HSSI is
only an electrical interface. What is most important is having the
processing power to move packets at the speed the interface allows, says
Richard Yates, product marketing manager. Another prerequisite is off-the-
shelf HDLC controller chips that support HSSI speeds, says Yates. Until
these are shipped, HSSI interfaces, he maintains, will be expensive.

CANNED HELP FOR LAN PROBLEMS: EFFECTIVE, BUT LIMITED
Expert systems from HP and Network General can solve some LAN problems
fast, but they can't be fine-tuned

By:
Mary Jander

When they're at their best, expert systems offer the collective wisdom of a
team of first-rate troubleshooters--without the high salaries, ego clashes,
and other fringe benefits such groups tend to engender. The expert systems
unveiled recently by two leading LAN protocol analyzer vendors work more
like second-line technicians: They do a good job of handling problems that
are familiar to them, but they can't be trained to try different approaches
or to handle new problems.
    Both Network Advisor from Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Colorado
Telecommunications Division (Colorado Springs, Colo.) and Expert Sniffer
from Network General Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.) can detect, diagnose, and
solve such LAN problems as duplicate addresses, cable breaks, and improper
node insertions in a matter of minutes. That not only saves LAN
administrators time and effort, but it also allows them to focus their
attention on other management issues.
    The down side to both packages, at least for now, is that the
canned wisdom they hold cannot be added to or altered. HP and Network
General enlisted the help of teams of network experts to develop their
respective knowledge bases for LAN troubleshooting, but users can't change
those knowledge bases to meet their specific needs. HP has indicated that
it plans to give users the power to add logic to its expert system, but a
delivery date for that addition has not been announced.
    The inability to customize the knowledge bases limits the utility
of both packages and has some users and competing vendors wondering whether
expert LAN analyzers are worth the trouble and expense to install at this
point. One beta user of Expert Sniffer reports that although the expert
system can uncover some critical flaws in the network, it also wastes time
tracking and solving problems that either aren't important or aren't
correctable, such as intermittent packet storms. Others note that some of
the expert analyzers' troubleshooting features already are available in
products like the LANalyzer from Novell Inc.'s LANalyzer Products Division
(San Jose, Calif.).

EXPERTS AT WORK

    HP's Network Advisor, which began shipping this past summer,
comprises an HP 4970 LAN protocol analyzer and Fault Finder expert-systems
software. Network General announced and demonstrated its Expert Sniffer in
September; the product will ship sometime in the first half of next year
and will be made available as an upgrade to users of the vendor's Sniffer
analyzer.
    The two products are in the same general price range. A Network
Advisor capable of handling both Ethernet and token ring LANs costs
$25,500. When it becomes available, Expert Sniffer will cost from $12,500
to $24,000, depending on whether users buy a card-only analyzer or a
complete platform including a portable computer. In contrast, Novell's
LANalyzer costs $12,500 for a board and software that handles either
Ethernet or token ring and $19,980 for a package that handles both LAN
types.
    Network Advisor and Expert Sniffer have many features in common.
Both work with Ethernet and token ring networks. Both invoke the expert
system as a function of the analyzer, treating the expert system like
another type of decoding program. In addition to providing media access
control (MAC)-layer troubleshooting, the expert systems use the decoding
functions of their respective analyzers to report on problems in
upper-layer protocols. For instance, if a file transfer can't be completed
because of a faulty packet, Expert Sniffer reports the problem to the user,
according to Network General. Among the protocols handled by both expert
analyzers are TCP/IP, DECnet, and Internet Packet Exchange (IPX). Neither
system handles WAN protocols.
    HP built its Fault Finder expert system with Smalltalk, a set of
DOS-compatible development tools from Digitalk Inc. (Los Angeles). In HP's
scheme, analyzer functions, such as decode tests, statistical monitoring
programs, and diagnostic tests, are organized in such a way that they can
be activated automatically in response to certain queries and hypotheses
posed by the expert system. As various hypotheses are tested, they lead to
more tests or to final decisions, which are posted graphically or in text
form on Network Advisor's display (see figure).
    For example, if a network technician is having trouble inserting a
new node onto a Novell NetWare token ring, he or she can activate Fault
Finder, which then tests the LAN for broken transmit or receive wires and
checks for responses from all network interface cards on the ring. If the
wires are intact and all other stations are responding, the system then
checks for other possible causes, such as an incorrect speed setting on the
network card in the new node.
    The initial version of Fault Finder uses what is known as a
rule-based approach to expert systems. In the rule-based approach, the
expert system's code contains hypotheses and solutions for each type of LAN
problem for each possible set of circumstances. In a sense, rule-based
expert-systems code can be thought of as containing an exhaustive list of
''if-then'' statements.
    In contrast, Expert Sniffer uses what Network General calls a
blackboard approach. The vendor says its expert system continually gathers
and sifts certain information about the network, such as routing paths,
applications, protocols, station types, and user names. The expert system
uses this information to create a problem matrix that enables it to
pinpoint problems without running through the gamut of possibilities
required by a rule-based system. Network General claims Expert Sniffer's
''learning'' capabilities make it more adaptable to individual networks. HP
says it will add a similar self-learning feature to Network Advisor in an
upgrade scheduled to be released this month.

KNOWLEDGE LIMITS

    The inability to modify the knowledge base of either Network Advisor
or Expert Sniffer can be particularly frustrating for users. Because of
this inflexibility, users can't add their own expertise to the analyzer or
modify the analyzer's responses to reflect specific networking
requirements.
    HP reportedly is investigating a way to let users add to Network
Advisor's knowledge base without disturbing its structure. Network General,
however, has announced no plans to let users alter Expert Sniffer's
knowledge base.
    Although users of either system can't alter the information in the
knowledge base, they can make some adjustments to the parameters the
systems measure. To set the thresholds or levels of packet activity
monitored by the system, Network Advisor users can exit the system and edit
an ASCII file containing that information. The edited file then is loaded
into the analyzer. Expert Sniffer's main menu offers users the option of
entering such data via an electronic form.
    One test user of Network General's Expert Sniffer gives the product
a qualified endorsement for LAN troubleshooting. Dell Holmes, lead analyst
in the computer technology services division of Halliburton Corp.
(Arlington, Texas), an engineering and construction conglomerate, says the
product can help save time for highly skilled technicians who already use
Sniffers to troubleshoot LAN problems. Instead of having to list a range of
hypotheses and test them systematically, technicians can activate Expert
Sniffer from the main Sniffer menu. According to Holmes, Expert Sniffer can
cut the time it takes to diagnose certain problems from hours to minutes.

PROS AND CONS

    While HP and Network General move ahead with their expert
analyzers, some other vendors hope to release expert products of their own
in the near future. Lexcel (formerly Micro Technology Inc., Fullerton,
Calif.) says it plans to add expert-systems technology to its Lance+
analyzer, which uses Novell's LANtern monitoring device to gather
information on packet activity in multiple LAN segments.
    The latest release of Lance+ has a fault-determination feature that
correlates the measurements taken by the network monitor with information
in Lance+'s relational database. This technique helps to locate the causes
of network problems more precisely, Lexcel says. With older versions of
Lance, when a hub caused a problem on a LAN segment, all the devices
attached to the hub were turned red on the monitor's graphical display.
With the new feature, only the hub turns red on the display. The addition
of an expert system will streamline this procedure even more: Instead of
having to activate a fault-detection program to get information about
problems, users will be notified automatically that a problem has occurred
and how it can be solved.
    Other vendors are acting as though they aren't convinced that
expert systems are the answer for LAN analyzers and monitoring gear.
Novell's LANalyzer Products Division, ProTools Inc. (Beaverton, Ore.), and
Spider Systems Inc. (Burlington, Mass.) all say they are considering adding
expert systems to their analyzers, but they provide only sketchy
information as to when and how they'll do so.
    Novell, in fact, points out that some features offered by the new
expert analyzers are already available in products like its LANalyzer.
LANalyzer's Automated Troubleshooting System lets users automate the steps
to be taken if certain types of network problems occur. For instance, if
performance degrades, the Automated Troubleshooting System can activate a
series of tests that check how many packets of which protocol are running
on the LAN. The system contains a template that users can call up from the
main menu to specify network conditions or thresholds at which certain
types of tests should be activated. Users can choose specific tests and
test sequences for each situation; they also can create new tests or alter
existing ones, Novell says.

SECOND OPINIONS

    Some industry developments could complement or even replace the
functions that expert systems provide to LAN analyzers and monitors. The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is now working on a simple network
management protocol (SNMP) management information base (MIB) that could
speed the addition of expert systems to LAN analyzers and monitors. The new
MIB, called the remote monitoring (RMON) MIB, not only will set up a means
for transmitting information from analyzers and monitors to SNMP management
stations but also will specify a way for SNMP coding to direct the
automatic testing of LANs by analyzers or monitors.
    In this case, expert systems could be added to existing SNMP
management stations rather than to LAN analyzers or monitors. Several
vendors that sell both LAN analyzers and SNMP management stations,
including HP, Lexcel, Network General, Novell, ProTools, and Spider, are
active on the IETF's RMON MIB committee, and all of them claim to be in the
process of adding support for the RMON MIB to their products.

BBN GREEN LIGHTS BUSLESS SWITCH
Emerald's high-speed switching module hits 160 Mbit/s full duplex for
aggregate throughput in the gigabit range

By:
Johna Till Johnson

BBN Communications thinks buses are just fine for crosstown traffic, but
they really don't belong inside corporate backbone processors. That's why
the venerable high-tech vendor has gone busless with Emerald, its recently
announced next-generation architecture for cell switching.
    Instead of a bus, BBN has come up with a switching module that
delivers port-to-port connectivity at 160 Mbit/s in full-duplex mode,
yielding an aggregate switching speed of several gigabits per second.
    Most of today's switches are built around buses, as are the
majority of multiplexers, computers, and microprocessor-based products. But
for very fast data transfers, even a high-speed bus can turn into a
bottleneck.
    Going busless is something of a family trait at BBN. Its parent
company, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.), developed a
concurrent supercomputer, the Butterfly, based on a similar busless
design.
    BBN clearly is hoping that its new architecture, which won't see
light as a product until late next year, will make the company as
successful with cell switches as it has been in the X.25 packet-switch
market, where it is a leading player.
    Assuming it can build a workable product, BBN then must decide
whether to license the technology to others or sell it itself.
    Building an Emerald cell switch might seem to make sense at first,
but some observers point out that the demand for cell switches may not be
strong until the end of this decade, which would keep the architecture out
of use for several years. If the company were to license the technology,
however, parts of it could be appearing in routers and multiplexers--as
well as switches--as early as the end of next year.
    Joaquin Gonzalez, vice president and service director for global
networking strategies at the Meta Group Inc. (Westport, Conn.), is among
those who see cell switching in the wide area decidedly in the future
tense--possibly as late as 1997. Gonzalez thinks cell relay won't catch on
in the U.S. until there is an application driving it, such as
desktop-to-desktop multimedia. That's why he thinks BBN should license the
technology to internetworking vendors, which would bring it to market much
faster.
    Potential users for an Emerald product include companies with large
networking needs, particularly carriers and alternative carriers, says
Robert Bellman, vice president of marketing for BBN. Fortune 100 companies
are another good bet, since many of their applications--such as tying
together fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) networks across the wide
area, imaging, and transporting isochronous voice and data--require a great
deal of bursty bandwidth.
    ''Cell switching in the kind of product we're developing is the
only technology that can handle bursty traffic and be efficient at the same
time,'' says Mark Lunardoni, a product line manager at BBN.

DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

    Its busless design enables Emerald to handle the high speeds
inherent in cell switching. Bob Hinden, senior technologist at BBN, points
out that because it's a shared resource, a bus acts as a bottleneck in the
data flow. Whenever one subsystem--say, a line card or processor--wants to
transmit data, it asks for sole access to the bus. This means other
subsystems must wait until the first one finishes before they can send
data. At low throughputs, it's possible to make the bus much faster than
the port connections. This isn't feasible, however, at multimegabit or
gigabit speeds.
    Another drawback with a bus-based architecture is that it's not
inherently scalable. As more subsystems are added, performance drops
because each subsystem must contend with the others to gain access to the
bus. The more subsystems, the greater the contention and the longer average
wait before any given subsystem gets the bus.
    In the Emerald approach, each line card accesses the switch
directly, so there are always full-bandwidth paths between cards on the
switch (see figure). Adding line cards doesn't reduce the performance,
because cards aren't in competition for the bandwidth.
    Key to the success of this approach is distributed
processing--putting intelligence on the line cards as well as in the
central processor. The line cards have two functions: They convert incoming
data to 53-byte cells (Emerald uses 53-byte cells with a 48-byte payload,
the standard size for asynchronous transfer mode), and they forward the
cells along the appropriate paths.
    Most cells traverse the switch without ever using the central
processor, which is thus freed to handle global issues, such as management
and flow setup. When a line card receives a packet of data, it parses the
header to determine where it's going. If there is an existing path (or
flow), the line card breaks the packet into cells and forwards the cells
along it. If not, the line card alerts the processor, which establishes a
new flow.
    Most cells travel along an established flow, says Hinden, which
means the burden of packet processing shifts from the processor to the line
cards.
    The combination of busless architecture and distributed processing
makes Emerald scalable and modular. Line cards can be added without slowing
performance; the switch module also can be upgraded. BBN won't give
specifics on the number of line cards that can be accommodated or what the
switch module can be upgraded to. Nonetheless, scalability is good news for
potential users. It means they can purchase a smaller version of the
switch, then upgrade as needs grow and budget permits. (BBN also is not
releasing pricing details.)
    A final feature of Emerald's is its ability to connect to LANs.
Although BBN again is keeping mum about specifics, some line cards will
connect to token ring, Ethernet, and FDDI. The design also will include
frame relay interfaces.

WOLLONGONG BUYS A EUROPEAN CUSTOMER BASE

The Wollongong Group Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.) has acquired a majority stake
in network integrator European Network Engineering (ENE, Brussels, Belgium)
with an eye toward providing networks that use Wollongong's Unix, VMS,
Apple Macintosh, Sun, and TCP/IP connectivity software on a range of
workstations, routers, bridges, cabling, and other networking devices
supplied by ENE. Wollongong won't disclose the exact size of its share in
ENE, but says it is greater than 50 percent. For Wollongong, ENE's chief
attraction is its customer base, which includes British Rail and the U.K.
divisions of Price Waterhouse and KPMG, formerly Peat Marwick. Wollongong
says it anticipates ENE's revenues, now about $5 million annually, to grow
by 40 percent to 50 percent as a result of the arrangement. Wollongong's
revenues, now at about $30 million annually, also are expected to grow.

SOUTH AFRICAN COMPANY PULLS OUT OF TIMEPLEX/ASCOM DEAL

Ascom Holding AG (Bern, Switzerland) has completed its purchase of network
equipment maker Timeplex Inc. (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.) from computer maker
Unisys Corp. (Blue Bell, Pa.). Originally, Unisys announced that Timeplex
would be purchased by a joint venture involving Ascom and Mercedes
Information Technologies Pty. Ltd. (MIT, Johannesburg, South Africa). MIT
pulled out of the deal, however, and Ascom now owns all of Timeplex. MIT
cited South African government regulations on foreign investment as the
reason for its withdrawal, but analysts suspect that the change has more to
do with Ascom's desire for sole ownership and its uncertainty about how
Timeplex would be managed by two owners. ''The thought of trying to control
Timeplex proved a little more hairy than anyone wanted,'' says Jim
Harrison, program director for global network strategies at the Meta Group
Inc. (Westport, Conn.), a market research firm.

AT&T CUTSLONG-DISTANCE T1 AND FRACTIONAL T1 PRICES. . .

AT&T has filed tariff revisions that would lower the cost of long-haul T1
and fractional T1 circuits. The changes, which will take effect this month
pending Federal Communications Commission approval, will affect monthly
rates for Accunet T1.5 services, Accunet Spectrum of Digital Services
(ASDS), and Voice Grade Private Line (VGPL) services. Accunet T1.5 prices
will rise for short-haul circuits and fall for long-haul T1 and fractional
T1 lines. The crossover point from increases to reductions occurs for
circuits longer than 150 miles. T1 service from New Jersey to California,
for example, falls from roughly $19,000 to roughly $17,000 per month;
384-kbit/s fractional T1 service on the same link drops from around $7,000
per month to around $5,500.

ATM FORUM TO PROMOTE INTEROPERABILITY

A forum dedicated to the further development and implementation of
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) specifications was founded last month. The
ATM Forum (San Jose, Calif.) aims to develop a specification for a
permanent virtual circuit ATM interface. ATM is a form of switching that
carries data in small, fixed-length packets called cells. The forum's
interface specification, expected to be available next spring, will allow
companies to design interoperable ATM products and services. Standards
governing ATM transport already have been developed by the CCITT and ANSI.
The forum's goal is not to contest these standards or to set itself up as a
rival standards body, but to ensure that standards are implemented by
equipment vendors and service providers, according to Charlie Giancarlo, a
founder of Adaptive Corp. (Redwood City, Calif.) and a charter member of
the forum. At press time, other members included Northern Telecom
(Mississauga, Ontario), Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.), and US
Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas City, Mo.). Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.) and Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.)
reportedly are interested in joining the forum.

DIRECT FAX LINKS PLANNED FOR DOS, WINDOWS, AND UNIX

Thanks to an impending standard, users soon may be able to fax documents
directly from word processing or spreadsheet applications running under
DOS, Microsoft Windows, or Unix. FaxBios, an application program interface
(API) from the FaxBios Association (Berkeley, Calif.), a vendor consortium,
is the first standard to cover multiple operating systems. Initially,
FaxBios will work only under DOS, but later releases will support Unix and
Windows. An earlier standard, the Communicating Applications Specification
(CAS), allowed documents to be faxed from an application, but only under
DOS. ''For a company like WordPerfect, only supporting DOS is an
unrecoverable flaw--we just can't be limited to one operating system,''
says Richard Holder, manager of peripheral products for the Corporate Lab
of WordPerfect Corp. (Orem, Utah) and information officer for the FaxBios
Association. Association members include Hewlett-Packard Co. (Palo Alto,
Calif.), Everex Systems Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), and Biscom Inc. (Billerica,
Mass.).

OSPF GETS SEAL OF APPROVAL

The open shortest path first (OSPF) routing protocol drew a major
endorsement over its rival, dual intermediate system-to-intermediate
system (IS-IS), from the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). The
IESG, which until now has given equal footing to the two protocols,
recommended that OSPF be made mandatory for all TCP/IP routers. ''We've
put the official gold star of approval on OSPF,'' says Noel Chiappa, area
director for the Internet. Vendors can still offer dual IS-IS, but they
must support OSPF as well.

SNMP MANAGEMENT FOR PROTOCOL ANALYZERS

Users may soon be able to use the simple network management protocol (SNMP)
to manage their network analyzers. The Internet Engineering Steering Group
(IESG) has recommended that a remote monitoring (RMON) management
information base (MIB) be advanced to proposed standard status. The RMON
MIB defines the SNMP values collected by analyzers. Several vendors already
are said to be using prototypes of the RMON MIB. Actual products could be
released as early as next year.

VIEWING THE FUTURE
FROM INTEROP

By:
Joseph Braue, Editor in Chief

Trade journalists must have a streak of fortune teller in the blood, given
how we love to try to predict where the industry is headed. But at last
month's Interop, I thought I'd give my crystal ball a rest. Instead, I
quizzed several of the industry's top execs as to what they think the big
stories will be over the next two years.
    For Frank Gratzer, a Bellcore division manager and point man for
the Baby Bells' Switched Multimegabit Data Service rollouts, the future is
SMDS. Plans now call for tariffed SMDS by the end of '92 or early '93 in 30
cities. With Bell Atlantic quoting a flat $500 monthly fee and an $800
installation charge per site, SMDS is starting to make sense for companies
with three or four sites in a metropolitan area that need to be connected.
    Eric Benhamou, president and CEO of 3Com Corp., sees SMDS, frame
relay, ISDN, and Switched 56 as technologies whose time is at hand. He
believes such services will reduce the number of WAN ports that bridges and
routers must pack, paving the way for cheaper, smaller internetworking
gear. Will corporations trust mission-critical data to carriers? Benhamou
says over time they will.
    The future of intelligent wiring hubs lies with cell relay,
according to Ralph Ungermann and Andy Ludwick, who are president and CEO,
respectively, of Ungermann-Bass Inc. and SynOptics Communications Inc.
Faster LANs (thanks to FDDI) and higher-bandwidth applications will push
hubs to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology.
    Routers look to be headed for some interesting times, since three
of the industry's top execs are stressing different trends. Wellfleet's
Paul Severino, president of Wellfleet Communications Inc., sees 1992 as
more network management and deeper integration of internetworking
functions. John Morgridge, president of Cisco Systems Inc., looks to the
coming year as a time for further integrating SNA and increasing the
emphasis on low-end sales. And Patrick Courtin, president of Proteon Inc.,
sees users creating enterprise-wide applications on top of internetworking
devices and teaching staff to support them.
    Who's right? As soon as we know, you'll know. And you won't need a
crystal ball, either.

TRANSATLANTIC
DIAL-UP LINKS:
STILL HIT OR MISS

By:
Tom Mangan, Lead Technologies

In real-world data communications, the whole often is less than the sum of
its parts. This lesson in mathematical illogic is painfully evident to
anyone who tries to establish transatlantic data links using dial-up lines.
The fiber optic cables that now cross the Atlantic have vastly improved the
line quality for voice calls, while advancements in modems have pushed the
speed envelope for data transmissions over domestic dial-up lines. Somehow,
however, these two developments have not added up to reliable, consistent
dial-up data communications.
    Of course, a few years ago no one would have even tried to set up a
dial-up data connection across the big pond. Most of the dial-up links
between the U.S. and Europe--for that matter, most intercontinental
links--were carried by satellite service. The echo, delay, and other random
noise associated with satellite transmissions made trying to establish
anything other than a low-speed (300- or 1,200-bit/s) data connection
virtually impossible. Most users turned to leased lines or X.25 services
for transatlantic data exchanges. Others put disks or tapes in pouches and
sent them via overnight delivery services.
    The arrival of transatlantic fiber cables TAT-8 and PTAT-1 gave
hope that reliable dial-up data links had arrived. But a recent project to
set up such connections has taught me otherwise.
    Our project involved connecting two IBM AS/400 computers, one in
the U.S. and one in the U.K., on an occasional basis for a client. The
AS/400 on the client's U.S. side (in Langhorne, Pa.) provides program
development and operational support to the U.K. system, located in
Tunbridge, Kent, about 100 miles outside of London. The client wanted the
U.S. AS/400 tobe able to dial up the U.K. machine and establish a
synchronous SNA Logical Unit 6.2 link.
    We considered using X.25 for the link, but ruled that option out
quickly because of cost. X.25 access charges in the U.K. are on the
prohibitive side. So we decided on the next obvious option, international
direct dial-up lines.
    At first, we used V.32 modems from two different manufacturers. We
chose to let SNA take care of error detection and correction. After some
tweaking of the modems and software, we were able to establish a dial-up
connection between the U.S. and the U.K.--but our success rate was only
about 20 percent. The other 80 percent of the time, we would get as far as
hearing the U.K. modem answer the call, only to have the U.S. modem drop
the line. When we did establish a link, we could maintain the line at 4.8
kbit/s, but 9.6 kbit/s was chancy. We tried adjusting the modems and
software further to improve our success rate, but to no avail.
    We then decided to replace the modems we were using with a matched
set from a single manufacturer. After adjusting the new modems, our success
rate improved from 20 percent to 60 percent. A 60 percent completion rate
is fine for a quarterback, but for corporate networkers it's disastrous.
    Our next move was to check the quality of the circuits. The
client's carrier on the U.S. side is AT&T. I had noticed that although most
voice calls to the U.K. site had good sound quality and lacked delay
characteristics, the calls were half duplex. Also, when a call was
established, the line emitted what can best be described as a
high-frequency glitch before the conversation could begin. Another factor
that began to be apparent was that starting around 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time,
the chances of getting a clean line for data decreased rapidly.
    We wondered why, with all the fiber optic circuits now linking the
U.S. and Europe, transatlantic connections were so unlike placing a call
within the U.S. We also wondered about using AT&T's Global Software Defined
Network (GSDN)--the client is an AT&T SDN user and was considering using
GSDN for placing calls to the U.K. site. In the U.S., SDN is primarily a
pricing mechanism; SDN calls use the same facilities as the rest of the
AT&T customer base. Would using GSDN make any difference?
    Armed with all these questions, we contacted AT&T for some help.
This turned out to be quite an adventure on its own. One AT&T
representative told us that overseas data rates were still limited to 300
to 1,200 bit/s. But a rep from AT&T Paradyne told us that AT&T Paradyne had
run several successful overseas dial-up tests with its modems at speeds up
to 14.4 kbit/s. The caveat for our project was that these tests were
conducted with sites located within major cities. We asked about test
results covering outlying areas, but such tests didn't seem to exist.
    No one we contacted at AT&T was able to provide a good, firm
technical explanation as to why we couldn't establish reliable dial-up
calls with the U.K. site. We speculated that since our location was in a
small town outside of London, the switching of the call through older
central offices in the U.K. might be the cause of the problem. Also, as
traffic built during the morning, the carrier might be switching some
traffic over older facilities (or even satellite) across the Atlantic.
    Research into the use of GSDN gave us some hope. AT&T works with
British Telecommunications PLC's version of SDN, called FeatureNet. This
service uses only one switching point in the U.K., which means we could run
an access line from our site to the FeatureNet node to bypass any older
central offices. Also, AT&T claimed that about 90 percent of the calls
placed with GSDN would travel on fiber facilities. And GSDN's product
specifications indicated that the network would support dial-up data rates
of 4.8 kbit/s, with 9.6 kbit/s ''permissive.''
    For now, our client will use dial-up lines with matched modems,
until a GSDN line is installed at the U.K. site. GSDN won't be a
cheapsolution: A FeatureNet access line now costs about $1,000 per quarter
(not counting usage). But it may be worth it if the success rate
increases.
    This adventure--or misadventure--has only reinforced my belief that
long-distance dial-up data communications is a hit-or-miss proposition.
Within the U.S., we have improved the odds with lots of fiber optic
facilities and better modems. But the odds are less favorable on the
international front, even though intercontintental transmission facilities
are improving rapidly. The odds won't get better until the local
infrastructures improve.
    Although AT&T didn't exactly distinguish itself on this project, I
doubt that the other U.S. carriers could have done any better. There isn't
much that any carrier can do when a call from its network is delivered to a
country that hasn't upgraded its local transmission and switching
facilities. Data calls to large cities stand a better chance of being
completed, but watch out in the outlying areas.
    Users who need to set up occasional international data
transmissions should first explore X.25. For small file transfers,
international public electronic-mail services are another option.
    If dial-up lines are the best alternative, a couple of steps may
help improve the odds on getting connections that work. The first is to
install matched modems from the same manufacturer--no small feat given the
government approvals required for equipment. That will allow you to do
''matched tweaking'' on obscure options such as turn around time,
disconnect signals, and the like. Another is to explore any advantages that
might be obtained from global virtual voice network services.
    One more word of advice: Keep the telephone number of your
overnight delivery service handy.

LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION . . . BREAKING INTO VIDEOCONFERENCING

By:
J.T.J.

Videoconferencing's recent drop in price and increased picture quality make
it a very appealing technology. But before network managers shout ''Roll
cameras'' or shell out any money for a system, they should consider the
following:
    Ann Earon, president of Telemanagement Resources International
(TRI, Lake Wylie, S.C.) advises: ''If you don't know what your needs are,
there's no point in buying technology.'' She suggests network managers find
out who within their companies needs videoconferencing, what kind of
technology is required, and where and how it's likely to be used. Then, she
says, ''set a benchmark for success,'' a way to determine whether the
videoconferencing system actually is helping the company. TRI designs
corporate videoconferencing systems and conducts seminars in this and other
telecommunications technologies.
    Success, she notes, can initially be measured by how often the
equipment is used. Another measurement can be travel dollars saved or
increased productivity.
    William Ray, director of communications network services for
Corning Inc. (Corning, N.Y.), points out that he took an active role in
finding out just who in his company could benefit from videoconferencing
and pumping up the technology. Before going ahead with a company-wide
installation, he found an executive willing to spend money from his own
budget to install a system. Ray paid for one unit and the executive paid
for the other.
    Ray set up a pilot system, and the executive started to realize his
project was being finished faster than planned. Meanwhile, Ray used the
pilot system as a live demonstration for other employees. ''Once people
could see the benefit, it started finding its way into other operating
units.'' Corning Inc. now has videoconferencing sites at its central
headquarters and at plants throughout the United States and in Tokyo.
    Ron Stevenson, the program manager for telecommunications at
General Electric Co.'s Corporate Information Technology division
(Fairfield, Conn.), tells a similar story. GE has had a videoconferencing
network in place for the past two and a half years. It links over 50 sites
across the United States and overseas and is tied into videoconferencing
networks at other companies.
    Before installing the network, Stevenson says, he distributed a
questionnaire asking employees about their meeting and travel habits. He
stresses that he didn't ask employees their opinions regarding
videoconferencing per se. Stevenson analyzed his data to see where
videoconferencing would save on travel costs and increase productivity. He
later wrote a company-wide guide about videoconferencing that gives
detailed breakdowns of the costs of trips and meetings and demonstrates how
and when videoconferencing might save.
    Although network managers might believe videoconferencing will cut
travel costs dramatically, this isn't always the case. Stevenson estimates
that 20 percent to 50 percent of travel can be displaced by
videoconferencing. In some manufacturing and engineering companies, the
real benefits may come in time saved designing and building systems.
    Furthermore, Earon points out that videoconferencing may actually
increase travel costs for a given configuration. If a company with several
outlying sites installs videoconferencing at its main sites, there might be
less travel between those two cities but more from outlying sites to
headquarters to use the videoconferencing facilities.

THE BIG PICTURE FOR H.261

By:
J.T.J.

Key to videoconferencing is the H.261 Recommendation, which the
International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) signed
off on in December 1990. It specifies how video bit streams are to be sent
across the network (at rates that are multiples of 64 kbit/s). Codecs that
incorporate this standard should be able to work together.
    H.261 also establishes a format for video, still-frame, and
high-resolution graphics--the Common Intermediate Format (CIF)--but
H.261-compatible codecs can conform either to CIF or to the Quarter CIF
(QCIF) subset. QCIF establishes lower video resolution than CIF (176 pixels
by 144 lines compared with 352 pixels by 288 lines). It also allows lower
resolution for graphics.
    Beyond decoding compressed video and displaying images in a
standard manner, codecs must establish communications across a network link
and compress and transmit the audio portion of a videoconference. Any
H.261-compatible codec must by definition conform to the CCITT
Recommendations that specify these functions. These recommendations fall
into two main categories: communications and control, and audio.
Communications and control specs include H.221, H.230, H.242, and H.320.
H.221 covers the frame structure of the videoconferencing link. H.230
describes the commands that each codec must be able to send, receive, and
interpret, such as loopback notification. H.242 handles call setup and
recognition, defining, for example, how two codecs establish data rates,
number of lines, and disconnect procedures. Finally, H.320 identifies the
equipment and system needed for narrow-bandwidth audiovisual
transmissions.
    Audio standards are spelled out in Recommendations G.711 and G.722.
While these weren't specifically developed for videoconferencing, many
codec vendors have adopted them. G.711 defines a 64-kbit/s encoding
algorithm that uses pulse code modulation (PCM); G.722 calls for 32 to 64
kbit/s of bandwidth using adaptive differential PCM (ADPCM). G.722 is
basically an improvement on G.711.
    Given these recommendations, it's possible to believe that
videoconferencing standards are well-nigh complete. But that's far from the
case. First, there are areas the CCITT has specifically chosen not to
standardize: video pre- and post- processing. It's this processing that
determines to a large degree the clarity of an image and processing delay
times.
    Second, there are areas that remain to be standardized, including
multipoint bridging, low-bit-rate audio encoding, encryption, and image
storage. Without a multipoint bridging spec, a vendor's codecs will only
operate with its own bridges. H.230 defines some of the necessary commands,
but the topic also is the subject of CCITT AV.254, which is still in
development. Ratification is not expected until 1992 or later. The CCITT is
just starting to work on low-bit-rate (16-kbit/s) audio and encryption;
low-bit-rate audio will free up more bandwidth for other purposes (such as
fax transmission). Encryption will help protect conference transmissions
against eavesdropping.
    Image-storage standards are under development by International
Standards Organizations (ISO) groups. The Moving Picture Experts Group, for
instance, is developing a spec for storing H.261-compatible video on hard
drives and optical disks. The Joint Photographic Experts Group is doing
similar work for digitized still-frame graphics.

FREEZE FRAME ON VIDEOCONFERENCING

By:
J.T.J.

To each its own'' is an apt description of the U.S. codec market. Of the
industry's Big Three, Compression Labs Inc. (CLI, San Jose, Calif.)
PictureTel Corp. (Peabody, Mass.), and VideoTelecom Corp. (Austin, Texas),
CLI is shooting for the high end. Its Rembrandt codecs are perhaps the best
known in the industry and tend to be perceived as top performers at high
bandwidths (384 kbit/s to 2.048 Mbit/s). The company also is hoping to put
its compression algorithms to work in high-definition television (HDTV) and
one-way business and educational video.
    PictureTel's specialty is low-cost videoconferencing, and it has
repeatedly broken price barriers for entry-level offerings. When it
introduced its $40,000 system in January, comparable setups cost about
$100,000. Its recent under-$20,000 monochrome startup system comes in at
roughly $10,000 less than rivals. Its codecs only run to 768 kbit/s; they
do not handle full T1.
    VideoTelecom hopes to add value by tying PCs and LANs into the
videoconference. The company's approach has garnered some attention but
relatively small market share thus far, although there are signs this may
be changing.
    A relative newcomer to U.S. videoconferencing, BT North
America--part of the British telecommunications giant--hopes to capture
significant share with its VC2200 and VC2100 codecs. These products were
designed by BT, but until this summer were manufactured and sold in the
United States by GPT Video Systems (Stamford, Conn.) as the System 261. GPT
will continue to sell the units, but BT has decided it wants a share of the
profits. According to Max Arafa, marketing manager for videoconferencing at
BT, his company has 70 percent of the market in the U.K. and 50 percent of
the Western European market (including the U.K.). BT has announced that it
plans on capturing 30 percent of the U.S. market within two years.

VIDEOCONFERENCING: NOT JUST TALKING HEADS

By:
Johna Till Johnson, Data Communications

If videoconferencing conjures up the vision of CEOs and other captains of
industry communing electronically with their international counterparts,
it's time to hit the fast-forward. That may be an apt description of
''traditional'' videoconferences, but today's technology is far more than
talking heads.
    Users have gotten the message loud and clear: They're starting to
connect smaller sites and tie other companies into video networks. They're
also working with conferencing gear in unusual ways: Engineers design
systems, lawyers take depositions, and professors teach classes--all via
videoconferencing. And surgeons are even guided through operations under
the watchful eye of the camera.
    Is videoconferencing a technology whose time has come? Industry
analysts and video codec vendors point to a barrage of statistics to
bolster their claims: Over the past few years, the price of a
videoconferencing system has dropped from $250,000 to under $25,000.
Elaborate rooms dedicated to videoconferencing are being replaced by
rollabout systems that turn any office into a conference room. And with a
standard finished up last year by the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee (CCITT) and now being implemented by codec vendors,
videoconferencing gear should soon be able to interoperate just like fax
machines or modems.
    Market forecasts are uniformly rosy. Forrester Research Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass.) predicts the market for videoconferencing equipment will
grow from a projected $120 million in 1991 to $239 million in 1995.
Herbert Maher, a senior vice president at the investment firm of Tucker
Anthony Inc. (Boston) sees equipment sales reaching as high as $300 million
in 1992, up from an estimated $185 million in 1991. Consulting and market
research firm Telemanagement Resources International Inc. (TRI, Lake Wylie,
S.C.) predicts worldwide annual revenues for videoconferencing equipment
and services growing from $510 million in 1991 to nearly $1.5 billion in
1995 (see Figure 1).
    ''I tell our clients, 'It's not a matter of if you will get
involved in videoconferencing, it's a matter of when,' '' says Ann Earon,
president of TRI. ''In fact, it's pretty safe to say that there aren't too
many industries out there that aren't doing something in video already.''
    But what makes 1991 or 1992 the year of the codec?
    Better equipment, for one thing: That means cheaper,
standards-based coder-decoders running compression algorithms with improved
voice and picture quality at lower speeds. Cheaper digital services from
network providers also are driving the market.
    To some extent, though, evolution has been the norm in
videoconferencing since 1981, when Compression Labs Inc. (CLI, San Jose,
Calif.) and NEC America Inc. (Herndon, Va.) were the only U.S. codec
vendors to speak of. Since then, the market has broadened to include such
players as Picturetel Corp. (Peabody, Mass.), VideoTelecom Corp. (Austin,
Texas), GPT Video Systems (Stamford, Conn.), and BT North America Inc.
(San Jose, Calif.)--all of whom offer codecs and conferencing systems in
the United States. Each has attempted to carve out a slightly different
niche, and individual codec designs reflect this.
    The top U.S. codec vendors are Compression Labs, PictureTel, and
VideoTelecom, in more or less that order (see table). In 1988, according to
Tucker Anthony, Compression Labs had the lion's share of the market,
selling 63 percent of all conferencing units. PictureTel followed, with 28
percent. The remainder was divided among the other companies. By 1992,
Tucker Anthony predicts that CLI's share will drop to 27 percent;
PictureTel's will hit 38 percent; and VideoTelecom's will climb to 15
percent (see ''Freeze Frame on Videoconferencing'').

STATE OF THE ART

    Compression is the sine qua non of videoconferencing; without
compressing the video images, conferencing would take up exorbitant amounts
of bandwidth. Until recently, all compression algorithms were proprietary,
which meant that codecs from different vendors couldn't work together. Last
December, however, the CCITT approved recommendation H.261, which defines a
video compression algorithm and a transmission mechanism for images at 64
kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s (see ''The Big Picture for H.261''). All major codec
vendors in the U.S. market either have implemented or will shortly
implement H.261-compatible algorithms. Many also still offer proprietary
algorithms.
    In essence, all compression schemes send an approximation of a
video image rather than the entire digitized image across the conferencing
link. And whenever possible, all transmit only those portions of an image
that have changed since the last frame rather than retransmitting the
entire frame each time.
    Thus, an algorithm's designers end up making fairly subjective
decisions about how best to approximate an image, and that can lead to a
fairly wide disparity in actual performance, even among algorithms based on
similar mathematical techniques. It's also why multiple algorithms are
available from most vendors.
    PictureTel, for example, offers SG3 (''second-generation 3''), SG2,
and H.261. SG3 is the most advanced, but software and sometimes firmware
upgrades are needed for older codecs. SG2 is offered for earlier PictureTel
codecs. Since putting multiple algorithms on a codec means adding software
or hardware or both, PictureTel offers one algorithm as standard and sells
the others as options (for $2,000 to $5,000 each). A typical customer might
purchase an SG3 codec and add H.261 to talk to units from other vendors.
    CLI supplies its Cosine Transform Extended (CTX) algorithm, Cosine
Transform Extended Plus (CTX Plus), and two versions of H.261 in four
packages for its Rembrandt codecs. The cheapest ($4,000) delivers CTX and a
lower-performance version of H.261. The $8,000 package adds a high-speed
version of the CCITT spec, and CTX Plus is added to the $12,000 package.
The final package includes four algorithms (both versions of H.261) plus
software for connecting to all other CLI codecs; it costs $21,500.
    Since vendors use different algorithms for their own products, how
do they ensure interoperability across their product lines? According to
Rich Baker, director of research for PictureTel, essentially the same way
that different-speed modems do. Once connected, two PictureTel codecs will
attempt to communicate using SG3. If that fails, they will drop down to
SG2, and finally to H.261.
    If that makes H.261 sound like the algorithm of last resort, that's
just how some in the industry see it. Robert F. Mitro, vice president of
sales and marketing at PictureTel, sees it as the the lowest common
denominator. ''We can get the same picture quality out of our proprietary
algorithm at 112 kbit/s as we do out of H.261 at 284 kbit/s.'' PictureTel's
Baker says the spec is primitive compared with PictureTel's own algorithms,
and John Walsh, senior vice president for planning and strategy at CLI,
calls it ''rudimentary connectivity.'' He also says H.261 lacks such key
elements as a low-bit-rate specification, encryption, and multipoint
communications.
    But BT sees it differently. ''We do not need a proprietary
algorithm,'' says Max Arafa, marketing manager for videoconferencing
products. ''We designed our product with H.261 in mind, and H.261 is
leading-edge stuff. Other vendors designed their products with H.261 as an
afterthought. Clearly they have optimized around proprietary algorithms.''
He accuses other vendors of promoting the idea that the standard is
insufficient in order to sell more of their own products.
    Users are equally split. Dan Gentile, telecommunications manager
for Maxtor Corp. (San Jose, Calif.) is evaluating videoconferencing systems
from CLI, PictureTel, VideoTelecom, and BT/GPT (products designed by BT and
manufactured by GPT are sold in the United States by both companies). In
his opinion, H.261 ''is very limited.'' But Ron Stevenson, program manager
for telecommunications at General Electric Co.'s Corporate Information
Technology (Fairfield, Conn.) has a different take: The vendors ''like the
fact that they have this embedded proprietary base, and they're going to
milk that to the end. Once it's all standards, it's all a commodity
market'' (see ''Lights, Camera, Action . . . Breaking Into
Videoconferencing'').
    Debate seems inescapable in a market where performance is so much a
matter of opinion. Although there are some objective criteria--frame
refresh rate, for instance--evaluating a codec tends to be more subjective
than, say, judging a T1 mux. Ultimately, there's really no substitute for
watching the picture through a range of motions and listening to the
sound.
    Resolution and motion are probably the best indicators of an
algorithm's abilities. PictureTel's Baker notes three key flaws affecting
video images: blocking, mosquitoes, and blurring.
    Blocking (or tiling) refers to images that resemble Impressionist
paintings: The image is present but fuzzy. Mosquitoes are tiny sparklike
points that form a shimmering halo (or aura) around a moving object or
person. Blurring describes a moving object that appears out of focus in the
area of motion.
    All three problems stem from the fact that compression algorithms
typically try to stuff a huge chunk of data through a narrow bandwidth pipe
by trading off resolution and smoothness of motion.
    In a codec, the analog video signal is sampled and converted into a
digital pattern that consists of 8-bit pixels. Each pixel describes either
the brightness or the color of a specific point. The Common Intermediate
Format (CIF) display specification, which is part of H.261, calls for
152,064 pixels per video frame, greater than 1.2 Mbits of data. Most codecs
transmit 15 to 30 frames a second. If those frames were uncompressed, it
could take nearly a T3 connection (45 Mbit/s) to transmit them. That's
where compression algorithms come in.
    Basically, compression algorithms attempt to hold down the number
of bits that must be sent per image. In effect, this is done by
transmitting only the ''important'' parts of an image and discarding the
rest.
    Most algorithms do so by using some variation of the discrete
cosine transform (DCT) to transpose the bit stream into the frequency
domain. (Frequency here refers to spatial, not temporal, frequency.) The
DCT of the image is run through a filter, which takes out the
high-frequency portions. (High-frequency, in this case, means those parts
of the image that are more or less uniform, say, those representing walls.)
The receiving codec performs the inverse of the transform and paints the
image on the screen.
    ''The object is to be able to represent the image in an accurate
way, even though you've thrown away 95 percent of it,'' explains
PictureTel's Baker. The transmitted information is thus not so much an
image per se, but instructions on how to reconstruct an image on the
receiving end of the transmission.
    The way a codec filters the signal affects the quality of the
image. If the filtering is not done well, viewers will see mosquitoes.
Blocking and blurring result more from the ongoing tug-of-war between
motion and resolution. A limited amount of bandwidth can be used either for
conveying information about motion or for image resolution, but not both.
    Blocking can be traced to initial division of the bit stream into
discrete blocks of pixels. With many algorithms, the processing is
performed block by block, rather than over the entire image. Typically, the
blocks are smoothed away by postprocessing at the receiving end, but if
there is a lot of motion, the algorithm won't have the bandwidth to modify
the blocks, and they'll appear on screen. With blurring, the codec lacks
the bandwidth to handle both resolution and motion: An object simply moves
too quickly to be captured with any degree of accuracy. The bandwidth is
devoted to capturing the motion, so resolution is sacrificed and the image
is blurred.
    Even when vendors agree on specific coding techniques (H.261, for
instance), codec performance can vary remarkably. The quality of the image
depends to a large degree on processing decisions (identifying the
''important'' part of any image or deciding how much bandwidth to devote to
smoothing).
    H.261, which is based on DCT, only specifies how the image is
decoded. It requires that codecs know how to conduct an inverse transform
and paint the image on screen; it does not specify how the image is to be
compressed. Hence, the diverse opinions about performance, particularly
when it comes to the CCITT spec. If a particular implementation of H.261 is
adept at reading the data and using the results, the picture will be
clearer and the motion smoother than another implementation's--yet both
will be able to interoperate.
TURN ON AND TUNE IN
    Another problem with judging performance is that many codecs may
appear to be ''tuned'' to particular data rates. In theory, the higher the
data rate the better the performance. In practice, this may not hold true.
Algorithms that deliver a certain quality at one speed may not do much
better at higher speeds. Similarly, codecs that perform well at high speeds
may look far worse at lower rates--much more than the drop in bandwidth can
account for.
    ''You should be able to have an algorithm that spans a wide range
of bit rates,'' says Baker. But given the complexity of the algorithms, it
makes sense for designers to try to optimize perceived performance at
particular speeds--usually those corresponding to such typical service
rates as 56 kbit/s, 112 kbit/s, 128 kbit/s, and so on.
    However, both the tuning and a viewer's response are subjective;
one vendor could choose to minimize certain features of an image at the
expense of others, making motion slightly smoother, say, at the cost of
greater blurring. A viewer who notices blurring more than smoothness might
find that ''tuning'' less desirable than other choices.
    Still, objective criteria exist. One of these is frame refresh
rate, the number of times a second that a receiving codec updates a picture
frame, which is basically a measure of the smoothness of motion. The North
American National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard specifies
roughly 30 frames per second for television broadcasts. The refresh rate
for codecs varies with the algorithm, data transmission rate, and motion in
a given image. (The more an object moves, the lower the frame refresh rate
will be.) CLI, often perceived as the Cadillac of codecs, tops out at 30
frames/s both with its CTX Plus algorithm and with H.261. That rate drops
to 15 frames/s for CTX. VideoTelecom achieves 30 frames/s with its Blue
Chip 30 algorithm and 10 to 15 frames/s with its other algorithms.
    A key point that tends to be overlooked, however, is that the
maximum frame rate is less critical than the minimum. An algorithm that
transmits 30 frames/s while displaying a blank wall but drops to 2 or 3
frames/s for a moving person is clearly not as good as one that maintains a
steady 10 frames/s.
    The catch is that vendors won't give their minimum frame refresh
rates, and for a perfectly valid reason: Frame rates decrease with the
amount of motion. A codec that maintains 5 to 10 frames/s during a
boardroom videoconference, for instance, might drop to 1 frame/s at a
basketball game. The best thing for net managers to do is compare codecs
displaying typical applications and attempt to push vendors on the issue of
minimum frame rates.

LET'S HEAR IT FOR...

    Another factor in the video quality equation is sound. True, the
image captures most of the initial attention in a videoconference, but
''The audio makes all the difference in the world,'' says William Ray,
director of communications network services for Corning Inc. (Corning,
N.Y.). Ray, who oversees a videoconferencing network with sites in the
United States and overseas, recounts an incident in which the audio wasn't
functioning properly. One potential user was unenthusiastic about the
equipment. Yet when the audio was corrected, the same user was impresssed
with the video quality. The picture quality hadn't changed at all, Ray
stresses, but the user's evaluation had improved enormously.
    Like images, sound is digitized and compressed by the codec.
Problems arise when the sound isn't synchronized perfectly with the picture
(someone appears to speak before his or her lips move, for instance) or
when the receiving codec doesn't cancel out echo.
    As with image transmission, these troubles are harder to overcome
at lower bandwidths because there are simply fewer bits to devote to a
solution. The bandwidth that's allocated to audio can range from 3.5 kbit/s
in very-low-bit-rate applications to 64 kbit/s in T1 video links. Most
vendors use adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) for audio
transmission, so effective audio frequencies range from 3.5 to 50 kHz.
    Videoconferencing echo is similar to echo in high-speed modems:
When a speaker at one end talks, the voice is transmitted across the link,
where it is heard at the other end. If the microphone at the other end
picks up that sound, it is retransmitted in an infinite loop, causing
feedback.
    Some of the ways that vendors try to eliminate echo involve keeping
volume down at the remote speakers, using directional microphones, and
employing elaborate switching mechanisms so that only the speaker's voice
is transmitted. Unfortunately, normal conversations are full of
interruptions, and speakers often get up and walk around the room. Thus,
vendors have developed echo cancellation algorithms--similar to those used
with V.32 modems but much more complex--that ''train'' the
videoconferencing units. In essence, the videoconferencing system measures
the acoustic characteristics of the conference room, taking what's known as
theimpulse response. (Depending on the algorithm, this impulse response can
be measured many times during the course of the conference.) Using this
information, the codec then subtracts the retransmitted echo from the
incoming voice signal. All in all, though, this is a very challenging
filtering process, and it rarely works perfectly.NEC, VideoTelecom, and
PictureTel all offer echo cancellation, but users seem to agree that the
PictureTel algorithm lives up to its sterling reputation. Corning's Ray,
for example, says PictureTel systems can be installed in virtually any room
without worrying about acoustics.

PICKING A CODEC

    Weighing all the performance issues to chose the right codec for
the job is probably the hardest part of designing a videoconferencing
system.
    As noted, users believe strongly that codecs vary in performance. But
performance alone should not be the only criterion: The amount of
bandwidth that must be allocated to achieve the desired picture quality
also is a factor. GE's Stevenson, for instance, says that his company
decided on the CLI product for most applications because of picture
quality, which he felt was more important (for most applications) than
bandwidth costs.
    GE's financial services division, however, chose PictureTel.
''Their needs are different,'' Stevenson says, explaining that financial
services tends to hold frequent, informal meetings, which makes the cost of
bandwidth more of an issue than picture quality. PictureTel delivers ''a
good picture at low bandwidth,'' Stevenson says.
    Finally, some users have specific requirements, such as the ability
to send and receive computer files and graphics during a videoconference.
Maxtor's Gentile, for instance, is intrigued by the fact that
VideoTelecom's MediaMax system will interface to his company's Ethernet LAN
to let him send engineering graphics. VideoTelecom is the only unit to date
with this ability.

THE REST OF THE SYSTEM

    Of course, a videoconferencing system includes more than just a
codec. Codec vendors and systems integrators also offer various cameras,
monitors, peripherals, and other options. From a network manager's
perspective, however, the most critical piece of equipment after the codec
is the access device. Codecs can work with switched and dedicated digital
links at bandwidths from 56 kbit/s to 1.544 Mbit/s, and they can connect to
these services in a variety of ways (see Figure 2).
    The plain-Jane approach is via a T1 CSU; this gives the codec
either the full T1 data rate or multiples of 64 kbit/s (depending on
service selected).
    Another option is to connect via a PBX. This makes sense when a
company has leased a T1 line to a site, for example, but will have some
channels free for low-bandwidth videoconferencing. Codec vendors often
have co-marketing agreements with PBX vendors. PictureTel, for example,
has agreements with AT&T for its Definity products and with Rolm and
Northern Telecom.
    With Switched 56 services, the codec generally connects through one
or two V.35 interfaces to a single or dual Switched 56 CSU/DSU. In some
cases, the CSU/DSU is integrated into the codec. PictureTel does this, as
does BT/GPT.
    Codec vendors also maintain lists of the products that will operate
with their equipment. CLI, for instance, will work with CSU/DSUs from ADC
Kentrox (Portland, Ore.), Digital Link Corp. (Sunnyvale, Calif.), and
Verilink Corp. (San Jose, Calif.).
    A final option for connecting to the network--one that's gaining
popularity--is through an inverse multiplexer. Although these units are
more expensive than CSU/DSUs, running $7,000 to $10,000 compared with
$2,000 or so, they make it possible to adjust bandwidth to the application.
A typical example of such a product is the Multiband bandwidth manager from
Ascend Communications Inc. (San Francisco).
    Ascend's Multiband combines multiple Switched 56 lines into a
high-bandwidth stream of up to 4 Mbit/s. This lets a company dial up only
the amount of bandwidth necessary for a particular call, allowing it to opt
for a low-bandwidth conference or a high-quality, 1.5-Mbit/s call. CLI is
planning to integrate its Multiband into its Rembrandt II/VP product line,
according to Ascend's co-founder Jay Duncanson. The company is planning
similar agreements with other codec makers.
    Multiband can connect to virtually any digital service, including
T1, Switched 56, and ISDN basic and primary rates. The flexibility of this
class of products, in fact, is a key reason for videoconferencing's growing
popularity. ''For the first time, videoconferencing is beginning to look
like standard telephone service,'' says Duncanson. ''You can procure a line
from a public carrier and pay only for service when you need it.'' Inverse
multiplexers also are offered by Teleos Communications Inc. (Eatontown,
N.J.), Newbridge Networks Inc. (Kanata, Ontario), and Digital Access Corp.
(Reston, Va.)
    PictureTel is taking a similar approach to digital services.
Although the company won't give specifics, the company's vice president of
sales and marketing, Robert Mitro, says it's planning to make its codecs
ISDN-capable.
    One part of the videoconferencing system that's often overlooked is
the multiport bridge. It's this gear that allows network managers to set up
multisite conferences; split-second switching is critical, since a bridge
must be able to switch among participants to keep the speaker's image on
screen. Instead of using bridges, it's possible to set up multiple
point-to-point links, but this gets expensive and cumbersome beyond
three-way conferences. Each site would need a codec, monitor, and comm link
for every other site.
    VideoTelecom, PictureTel, and CLI all make proprietary bridges.
Alternatively, net managers can use special bridging services from the
carriers, which have already purchased bridges and installed them at
central-office sites. Customers using digital services and codecs from the
same vendors as the bridges merely need to dial in to a specific number,
and the carrier will arrange the videoconference.

CHEAPER BY THE MINUTE

    The precipitous drop in price of videoconferencing equipment in
general and codecs in particular also has excited interest in this
technology. This year alone, the cost of an entry-level system hit two new
lows. In January, PictureTel introduced its System 4000 family, with a
starting price of $39,500; in July, it added two low-end models, the Model
20 and the Model 100, with a buy-in price of $19,900 for a monochrome unit.
Interestingly, even PictureTel admits to a degree of hype in all this
price-slashing: Mitro concedes that a true entry-level system--a bare-bones
system with a color monitor--starts at around $25,000. Still, that is a
sharp decline from the cost of a comparable system in 1988, which would
have run roughly $150,000.
    Why the drop? Codec vendors cite two reasons: first, technical
advances in the silicon. PictureTel and others who have been designing
their own chips have found they can consolidate functions of two or more
chips onto one piece of silicon, with a corresponding savings.
    Second, the law of supply and demand dictates that as
videoconferencing becomes more popular and vendors sell more products,
prices will come down.
    Equally important is the drop in the prices of network services.
''In 1987, the cost of a New York-to-California videoconference call was
maybe $150 an hour,'' says Mitro. Today that cost is under $20 an hour.
''Now it costs less than a call from a cellular car phone.''
    In that same period, the types of available services has grown
enormously. When videoconferencing made its debut as a business technology,
the only feasible way to link codecs was via a 1.544-Mbit/s dedicated line.
Now, in addition to dual 56-kbit/s links, carriers offer switched N56/64,
Switched 384, and switched T1, among others. And these services are getting
cheaper all the time.
    Bob McCarthy, product manager for AT&T Accunet switched digital
services, explains that the big change came in 1990, when the carriers
understood the need for usage-based prices for switched digital services.
Until then, he says, AT&T expected the primary application would be to back
up dedicated lines. But last year, it realized there were other
applications--including videoconferencing.
    As a result, AT&T cut its prices by about 75 percent, says
McCarthy, with a resultant surge in videoconferencing applications.
Corning's Ray says that his company installed its first pilot system last
summer, although he'd been following videoconferencing technology for five
years: ''By then, the price had come down until it looked affordable.''
    Despite the advances in network services, though, ''the big bugaboo
is still the network,'' says TRI president Ann Earon. Interoperability and
availability problems still remain. For instance, AT&T's switched digital
services won't work with those from US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas
City, Mo.) or MCI Communications Corp. (Washington, D.C.).
    Interoperability is holding back one of the most potentially
explosive applications of videoconferencing, company-to-
company conferencing. While H.261 means that codecs can interoperate, a
codec on a digital service from, say, Sprint, won't talk to another unit on
an AT&T network except through a gateway, a custom-
designed bridging unit. Companies that want to videoconference with their
suppliers, customers, business partners, and anyone else have to make sure
that these groups are on the same network.
    In general, conferencing systems come in two distinct sizes: room or
boardroom systems, which are more or less permanently installed in a
dedicated conference room, and rollabouts, which can be moved from room to
room. So-called desktop systems are somewhere in between--small enough to
be moved from one room to another but not designed to be portable. Some
vendors offer a range of products: PictureTel, for instance, supplies six
models of its System 4000, and other codec vendors have followed suit.
    The difference betwen a boardroom system and a rollabout is
primarily packaging: The same codec can be installed in either. Most
vendors' systems are modular, peripherals like control panels and graphics
cameras and stands can be added as necessary.
    Most analysts believe that traditional boardroom videoconferencing
is on the wane. While conference rooms will never disappear, they say,
these systems will become less important over time, as users add smaller,
more flexible solutions. TRI predicts that while room models will capture
nearly half of the revenue in 1991 (41 percent), they will account for only
29 percent of the market by 1995. Desktop models, by contrast, will grow
from 8 percent in 1991 to 29 percent 1995. TRI also sees multipoint
conferencing as a small but growing segment of the market, moving from 1
percent in 1991 to 3 percent in 1995.

WHERE IT'S GOING

    What lies ahead? The crystal ball is, as always, cloudy, but some
trends stand out:
    For VideoTelecom, the integration of computer graphics and data is
already a reality. The company's Mediamax ''mediaconferencing'' system lets
users tie in LAN and PC data and graphics with more conventional audio and
video components. Because the system uses a PC-based architecture, it
connects as readily to a LAN as any PC. This sort of computer literacy is
not wasted on some users. Maxtor's Gentile points out that the ability to
exchange computer graphics would be very handy in engineering
applications.
    Other vendors agree that PC-based videoconferencing is the way to
go. PictureTel and Intel Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) have entered into an
agreement to develop multimedia technology for desktop applications.
    It's no news that the original picturephone flopped in 1964 and has
gone nowhere since. But CLI and AT&T have a joint venture to bring to
market a 19.2-kbit/s, full-color, full-motion videophone by 1992, and
others are likely to follow in their wake. PictureTel and BT/GPT have both
expressed interest in developing such a device. Hitachi recently displayed
a prototype ISDN-compatible unit that sells in Japan for 1 million yen
(about $7,000).
    In the end, the chances are very good that videoconferencing will
find its way to the desktop, whether inside a computer or added onto a
phone. More importantly, codecs will continue to get better and cheaper,
data services will proliferate, and standards will evolve to make products
truly interoperable. So get ready for videoconferencing. It'll be a fact of
life in the '90s.

CALLING ALL LANS: ISDN FOR LAN INTERCONNECT
Public ISDNs are starting to emerge as a practical way to link LANs in
Europe. But given serious equipment shortcomings and patchy service
availability, users are well advised to look before they leap

By:
Stephen Saunders and Elke Gronert, Data Communications International

In theory, Europe is just one PC card away from LAN interconnect via ISDN.
Commercial ISDNs are beginning to operate across the Continent, promising
to deliver users at last from notoriously high leased-line tariffs. ISDN's
long list of benefits seems too good to be true: It provides as much
bandwidth as digital leased lines. It's billed by the minute instead of the
month. Users get advanced features like the ability to call multiple
locations simultaneously. A one-minute transmission can be set up within a
couple of seconds between any pair of ISDN users. All that's been missing,
so the theory goes, is a card to connect LANs to ISDN. And now that such
cards are starting to appear, Europe should be ready to cross the threshold
into an era of faster, more efficient LAN connections over the wide area.
    In reality, though, users looking to connect LANs over ISDN today
face two major obstacles. First, only a handful of European countries have
full-scale commercial ISDNs, and coverage is patchy in some of those.
Second, most large vendors of bridges and routers--the key building blocks
of LAN interconnect--have yet to implement ISDN interfaces. Many other
vendors have brought out interim solutions, mainly in the form of PC-based
ISDN interface cards and software that perform bridging and routing. These
products range from low-end, manually operated devices to an IP router with
a throughput of 2.048 Mbit/s (see Table 1).
    These interim products are suitable only in certain applications.
The penalty for picking the wrong product could be a PTT bill so large it
makes users wonder why they bothered to switch to ISDN. But in the right
situation, an ISDN interface can save lots of money and even make possible
applications that previously were out of the question. If any one statement
can be applied to ISDN products thus far, it's that it pays for users to
shop carefully.

EQUIPMENT OBSTACLES

    The idea of ISDN for LAN interconnect is an appealing one: It
replaces slow analog dial-up lines and costly digital leased lines with a
fast, cost-efficient, ubiquitous service. All nodes on all LANs get two
64-kbit/s B channels, one 16-kbit/s D channel, and access to any other
node--a new concept for Europeans unfamiliar with switched digital
services. But a standard device that ties LANs to ISDN doesn't yet exist.
To date, the closest thing to it is a PC-based ISDN interface card and
bridging or routing software, used in conjunction with a standard LAN
interface card (see figure).
    Europe's low number of ISDN users and its patchwork of different
ISDN standards have discouraged bridge and router vendors from developing
integral ISDN interfaces for their equipment. ''Unless you target a
specific country, the market just isn't there,'' says David Bird, technical
support manager for the U.K. division of router maker Proteon Inc.
(Westborough, Mass.). Each national ISDN interface has to undergo lengthy
attachment approval tests, further discouraging vendors, says Nigel Oakley,
product marketing manager for U.K. operations of 3Com Corp. (Santa Clara,
Calif.). Still, some bridge and router vendors are developing ISDN
interfaces. Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.), for example, says it will add a
64-kbit/s ISDN interface to its bridges by mid-1992 for unspecified
countries.
    Using a terminal adapter to connect existing routers or bridges to
an ISDN has some serious shortcomings, despite what vendors may claim. The
problems arise from ISDN's use of a separate D channel to carry the signals
that set up and tear down calls, identify the type of traffic on the B
channels, and invoke other services such as calling-line identification. In
a normal bridge or router, that information is carried on the same channel
as the data; terminal adapters cannot separate and convert it for use on
ISDN D channels. As a result, the terminal adapters will pass traffic from
routers and bridges to ISDN B channels but they cannot set up and tear down
calls automatically--often a vital feature for minimizing line costs.
    IBM acknowledges that the inability of its terminal adapter, the
7820, to automatically control ISDN lines is a drawback, but it says it's
addressing the problem, as are other vendors. Terminal adapters that
present an X.21 or V.24 interface can be configured to automatically dial a
preset number and thus set up an ISDN B channel call when requested by the
attached equipment. Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) uses this
facility in Version 8.3 of its firmware so that its routers can invoke an
ISDN backup when the existing trunk fails or becomes congested.

INTEGRATED INTERFACES

    While bridge and router vendors are hanging fire on integrating
ISDN interfaces in their products, major computer makers such as Digital
Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (Palo Alto,
Calif.) are launching ISDN interface cards that connect LANs to other LANs,
hosts, or standalone PCs. Many smaller vendors also have developed packages
for PCs and Apple Macintoshes comprising ISDN cards and bridging or routing
software.
    Of the products shown in Table 1, most are PC cards. They can be
managed with the PC's monitor and keyboard, and the PC's hard disk can be
used to store configuration data. The disadvantage is PCs are not designed
specifically as bridges or routers and thus provide much lower performance
than specialized devices.
    Some features of sophisticated bridges, such as filtering of
broadcast packets, are likely to be rudimentary in PC-based bridges.
PC-based routers will likely do a better job than PC-based bridges in
filtering out unwanted packets before transmission over ISDN. It's worth
checking whether products support the full complement of router functions,
such as multihop routing and intelligent load balancing. Some vendors, such
as MBP Kommunikationssysteme GmbH (Dortmund, Germany), have incorporated
support for Novell's Internet Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol in their
products to ensure full router functionality across an ISDN.
    Some vendors interviewed for this article were unable to say if
their products were bridges or routers, or what protocols their products
would support. For this reason, users are well advised to borrow products
for evaluation before buying them. After installation, it's also advisable
to monitor PTT bills, if possible on a daily basis, to check whether the
ISDN is carrying packets that should have been filtered out.

LINE CONTROL

    Automatic line control offers another way to minimize PTT bills.
Usually implemented in software, line control lets users adjust their
equipment so that calls can be extended to match the billing increments set
by PTTs. The length of these increments varies; it can be as little as 18
seconds on many long-distance routes to as long as six minutes for local
calls in Germany. ''You can program our device to hold the call until just
before that time, and then drop it,'' says Stefan Gieseler, manager of
product marketing for communication systems at MBP. As increment length
rises, so does the ''free'' time available to users. At the same time, line
control helps users cut down on billing for unused connection time.
    Automatic re-establishment of failed ISDN calls is a feature worth
paying for. It would have paid dividends for the Department of Computer
Science at University College London, where ISDN connections were dropped
every 10 minutes by a bug in an ISDN switch from British Telecommunications
PLC (BT, London). Using information available on the ISDN D channel, the
university's failed calls could have been re-established automatically.
    With automation, however, comes the need for network management.
Like other services, ISDNs must be monitored so that alerts can be
triggered when problems arise. Without alerts, network managers may
unwittingly invoke backup lines (and rack up usage charges) while failed
lines lie idle and unreported to the PTT.
    A few vendors, such as Hewlett-Packard and Bintec Computersysteme GmbH
(Nuremberg, Germany), incorporate support for the industry-standard simple
network management protocol (SNMP) in their products. Other vendors, such
as OST S.A. (Cesson-Sevigne, France) and Teli AB (Nynashamn, Sweden),
provide local proprietary management. Digital Equipment Corp. provides
local or remote proprietary management.  But some vendors don't provide
any method of managing their products, either locally or remotely; these
include Industrade AG (Wallisellen, Switzerland) and Stollmann GmbH
(Hamburg, Germany).

MANY CARDS, MANY CALLS

    Most ISDN cards support simultaneous calls over both B channels of a
basic-rate interface (BRI), and some products accept multiple cards in the
same chassis, enabling communications with several destinations at once.
For example, up to three DEC ISDNcontroller 100 cards can be fitted into
the Q-bus of DEC's MicroVAX computers. When loaded with DEC's VAX ISDN
Access Software, the MicroVAX acts as an ISDN Ethernet server, allowing
data from LAN-attached nodes, including non-bus computers, to be routed
over an ISDN to nodes on remote LANs also equipped with the card. With
three cards loaded, the server simultaneously can exchange data with six
sites at 64 kbit/s per connection. Multiple ISDN cards can be installed in
PCs as well as minicomputers. Up to four of MBP's cards supporting NetWare
routing functions can be combined to support eight simultaneous calls. Up
to eight of OST's IP router cards canbe installed in the same PC to
support 16 simultaneous 64-kbit/s calls.
    Some vendors add another degree of sophistication by synchronizing
calls to the same location so that higher bandwidths can be supported.
Industrade offers an IP router similar to OST's, but its product can
combine any two channels for total throughput of 128 kbit/s. In
Hewlett-Packard's ISDN Server, up to six B channels can be combined to
deliver throughput of 384 kbit/s.

BIGGER BANDWIDTHS

    Bintec recently took the concept of multiple cards and channel
synchronization a step further with the introduction of its ISI/Gate IP
router, which can provide aggregate bandwidths as high as 2.048 Mbit/s--the
same as an E1 leased line. The router has slots for 16 ISDN cards (from
other vendors as well as Bintec) in an AT bus. Each ISDN card can be
connected directly to a BRI socket or to a PBX connected to an ISDN.
    ''We tested all the available solutions on the market, and ISI/Gate
is the only one which can be expanded to support 32 B channels,'' says
Andreas Merkel, a member of the data processing center's networking group
at the University of Konstanz (Germany).
    Bintec also is the only vendor to have implemented data compression
in its product. Usually, protocol overhead can cut actual throughput to
rates as low as 40 kbit/s on each 64-kbit/s channel, but Bintec's device
uses an algorithm called Van Jacobson Compression to reduce TCP/IP protocol
overhead from 40 bytes to just 5 bytes per packet. With compression turned
on, data throughput of 62 kbit/s can be achieved on each B channel,
according to Merkel. ''Without the compression this throughput wouldn't
have been possible,'' he says. Another vendor, Dataflex Design Ltd.
(London), is working on a way to incorporate the CCITT's V.42bis error
correction and data compression algorithm in its terminal adapter. Dataflex
says it will ship a product by the end of the year.
    The ISI/Gate also supports communications with any other ISDN location
as wellas simultaneous communications at lower speeds with multiple sites,
neither of which would be possible with a normal router attached to an E1
line. A primary-rate version of the ISI/Gate will be available in
mid-1992, says the vendor.
    Only one vendor--Gandalf Data Ltd. (Nepean, Canada)--already
supports LAN interconnection over a primary-rate interface (PRI, which in
Europe combines 30 B channels). Gandalf's ISDN Primary Rate Subsystem fits
inside its Starmaster multiprotocol communications server. The Starmaster
links IEEE 802.3 Ethernets and routes TCP/IP and DEC's Local Area Transport
(LAT) protocols. Like the Bintec product, Gandalf's offering can
synchronize all its channels to deliver the maximum throughput of 1.92
Mbit/s.
    Gandalf's Subsystem can connect the Starmaster to ISDN PBXs from
Northern Telecom (Mississauga, Canada), AT&T (New York), BT, Siemens AG
(Munich), and GEC Plessey Telecommunications PLC (GPT, Coventry, U.K.),
enabling Starmaster-attached devices to share ISDN bandwidth with
PBX-attached voice lines.
    An early user of the Gandalf switch, the Department of Computer
Science at University College London, says the switch adds five seconds to
call set-up times. In experiments with BT's ISDN, calls took seven seconds
to set up when routed through the switch and only one or two seconds when
routed through other equipment.

WHEN ISDN PAYS

    But even the most advanced ISDN gear is only as good as the service
it's connected to. However appealing the prospect of ISDN for LAN
interconnect may seem, users should examine availability and tariffing
issues before rushing out to buy the latest in ISDN interfaces. The
economic argument for or against LAN interconnect via ISDN varies according
to the type of traffic being supported, the distance between sites, and the
country. As is the case with the interface equipment, users need to
consider their needs carefully before committing to a service.
    ISDN is best suited for relatively large file transfers because its
64-kbit/s B channels are circuit switched and because usage charges are
based on ordinary telephone tariffs, which usually have a minimum duration
of at least one minute. In theory, a 480-kbyte file--relatively large by
most standards--can be transferred across a 64-kbit/s link in one minute.
    An unidentified car maker in Europe already is using ISDN to ship
CAD files to its component suppliers, according to Sun Microsystems Inc.
(Mountain View, Calif.). The files are generated on Sun workstations and
shipped via networks of PC-based bridges and routers. ''ISDN is absolutely
strategic to this company,'' says Jean-Pierre Baudouin, head of Sun's
International Center for Network Computing (Grenoble, France), which is
charged with developing ISDN interfaces for Sun workstations.
    There are other applications, such as those involving interactive
traffic, where ISDN may not be economical for LAN interconnect. When
interactive traffic is carried via ISDN B channels, users pay for bandwidth
whether they use it or not, since a link must be kept active to handle
whatever traffic is generated. In this case, packet-switched services may
be more economical. Some of the LAN interconnect services based on frame
relay, itself an outgrowth of ISDN, might offer another alternative when
(and if) they become widely available in Europe.
    ISDN's feasibility vis-a-vis leased lines depends on the distance
between sites and on the country (or countries) where the sites are
located. In short, ISDN is most cost-effective when linking LANs across
borders at 64 kbit/s, according to the consultancy Logica Cambridge Ltd.
(London). In Belgium, for example, a 64-kbit/s leased line would be more
cost-effective than ISDN only if users required more than 230 minutes a
day of connect time (see Table 2). In Germany, where leased-line tariffs
are among the highest in Europe, users would need 450 minutes of daily
connect time to justify a 64-kbit/s cross-border leased line. Even in the
case of BT, which nearly doubles its charges for international data calls
over ISDN, the break-even point for leased lines is 158 minutes per day.
    Within countries, however, it's a mixed picture. ISDN is a
nonstarter as an alternative to leased lines within the U.K. But in
Belgium, primary-rate (1.92-Mbit/s) ISDN compares much more favorably with
leased lines than a single B channel, particularly for local links. At
present, it pays to use primary-rate ISDN rather than a 1.92-Mbit/s leased
line in Germany if daily usage totals less than 90 minutes. However,
drastic cuts are planned in German leased-line tariffs that might upset
these calculations.
    Where tariffs are similar, of course, ISDN is a much better
alternative to digital leased lines. Unlike leased lines, ISDN enables
users to connect with any other user of switched digital services--an
advantage that will snowball as ISDN's coverage increases, national ISDNs
are interconnected, and the number of ISDN users increases.

PATCHY COVERAGE

    At present, ISDN in Europe is characterized by limited
availability, few users, and plans for rapid expansion by 1994. Those are
the conclusions of a recent study prepared for the Commission of the
European Communities by two consultants, Ovum Ltd. (London) and
Fischer & Lorenz (Copenhagen, Denmark). The study, titled ''European ISDN
Atlas, 1991,'' shows where ISDN is available and when it will reach other
locations in the European Community. ISDN installation plans are given for
all European Community countries, as are the years when ISDN will be
commercially available in each major city.
    Only four European countries--Belgium, France, Germany, and the
U.K.--had commercial ISDNs on January 1, 1991, according to the study. At
that time, the number of installed basic-rate ISDN lines totaled a mere
14,665, compared with 100,000 in the U.S. and 20,000 in Japan. Europe had a
total of 2,865 primary-rate lines, compared with 500 in the U.S. and 500 in
Japan.
    Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (Bonn, Germany) gives higher figures
than those in the study, but its numbers are for ISDN lines ordered, not
lines installed. The difference in statistics does show that Germany is
investing heavily in ISDN, as are some other European PTTs.
    In fact, the PTTs are closer to offering comprehensive coverage
than U.S. carriers, according to one of the study's authors, Ovum's Stephen
Timms. France Telecom already claims to offer national coverage for its
ISDN, Numeris, although it acknowledges that users might have to wait six
months for an ISDN line in some locations.
    By January 1, 1994, the deadline set by PTTs for the delivery of
commercial ISDNs based on common European standards, PTTs are promising
ISDN in 100 percent of business locations in Belgium, Denmark, France, and
the U.K. Standardized service, sometimes called ''Euro-
ISDN,'' will be available in 80 percent to 99 percent of business locations
in Germany and Portugal, 60 percent to 79 percent of those in the
Netherlands and Ireland, and 40 percent to 59 percent of those in Italy and
Spain, according to the study.

MULTIVENDOR NETS
MADE EASY

Putting together a multivendor network is difficult enough, but to those
charged with explaining each vendor's systems and network architectures the
job can seem just about impossible. In A Manager's Guide to Multivendor
Networks, John Enck maps out an approach that's comprehensive enough for
training executives and technical staff alike. The book not only defines
the networking architectures of four key vendors--IBM, Digital Equipment
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Sun Microsystems Inc.--but also notes the
similarities and differences among them.
    Enck also explores the ties that bind together multivendor nets,
including standards, messaging services, and network management systems.
Most major U.S. and European standards are covered, as are the OSI
seven-layer reference model and the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP)
standard. Enck examines the major components of wide-area services,
including X.25 networks and X.400 electronic mail, and offers a guide to
troubleshooting problems on LANs and WANs. The book costs $35.

A COMMON MOTIF

Motif, the graphical user interface for X-Windows, goes Microsoft Windows
one better: Unlike the popular PC operating environment, the Open Software
Foundation's Motif is platform-independent. Indeed, the X-Windows system
itself already has been implemented on networks made up of Unix, VAX, DOS,
and Apple Macintosh systems. With Motif Programming Manual by Dan Heller as
a guide, users can write a single, consistent, intuitive interface for all
their applications.
    Heller, the creator of Z-Mail, a widely used electronic-mail
package, introduces the Motif tool kit and supplies definitions of all
classes of Motif objects. In addition to explaining the Motif programming
model, Heller discusses the basics of user interface design. Each of the
main elements of the Motif library is examined in its own chapter. The
manual assumes some familiarity with the C programming language, although
Heller notes in his preface that ''even those who dabble in C can
understand the concepts well enough to do most things.'' Motif Programming
Manual costs $34.95.

IBM'S SYSTEM VIEW: ADDING FUNCTION TO FORM
A year after its unveiling, IBM's grand scheme for total systems
management is still in its formative stage

In product announcements and statements of direction issued over the past
year, IBM has gone to great lengths to tell the world that SystemView is a
cornerstone of its master information technology plan for the 1990s and
beyond. Yet more than a year after SystemView's unveiling, its composition
and implications remain a mystery.
    IBM itself is largely to blame for much of the confusion
surrounding SystemView. In many of its statements, the vendor has implied
very strongly that SystemView is a real architecture, albeit one that has
yet to be released formally. The reality, however, is that SystemView is
not an architecture but a strategy that to this point lacks a tangible
foundation.
    SystemView's charter is ambitious: to provide a total systems
management framework for enterprises with information processing systems
that are built on a diverse collection of computing and communications
platforms. SystemView encompasses not only the hardware but also the
applications and the operational procedures required to run a distributed
computing environment from the largest IBM and non-IBM systems down to
individual desktop workstations.
    SystemView's breadth and scope are daunting enough to give pause
even to staunch IBM supporters. Yet many corporate networkers now are
counting on IBM to deliver on its lofty promises. More thana third of the
nearly 460 network management professionals who responded to a May 1991
survey by the Datapro Information Services Group (Delran, N.J.) said they
would choose SystemView as their open systems management model--ahead of
such high-profile solutions as OSI and TCP/IP with its simple network
management protocol (SNMP). No doubt that percentage will climb as IBM's
plans begin to take shape with real products.
    If SystemView lives up to all of IBM's advance billing, few users
are likely to be disappointed. In IBM's scheme, SystemView will serve as a
framework that will enable most, if not all, of the diverse management
activities of running a computer system to be integrated and, where
possible, automated. It will go beyond ''technical'' issues to address
other management tasks integral to the operation of any system, such as
financial administration, service-level tracking, capacity planning, and
even business planning.
    IBM is counting on SystemView to help it maintain its leadership
role in defining the direction that information technology will take. IBM
has prided itself on being able to develop proprietary architectures that
become industry standards with tremendous staying power--witness the
System/370 and SNA. IBM's latest architectural foray, Systems Application
Architecture (SAA), has not been a resounding success to date, but IBM
seems intent on boosting SAA into its systems pantheon. In its September
1990 unveiling of SystemView, IBM went to great lengths to make one point
very clear: SystemView is an integral part of SAA.
    Ideally, IBM would have waited until SystemView's underlying
architecture was intact--or at least clearly defined--before announcing it.
But pressure from other vendors, most notably Digital Equipment Corp.,
forced IBM to take the wraps off its strategy. DEC announced its total
systems management plan, Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), in 1989,
a year before IBM gave any inkling of SystemView.
    Although the September 1990 introduction of SystemView and a
smattering of ''conformant'' products seemed rushed, it did manage to
swing the momentum in the systems management race in IBM's favor. With one
bold and blustering move, IBM managed to take the high ground and redefine
the expectations for the range of management functions needed for computer
environments in the coming years. In the process, IBM also raised the ante
in the high-stakes battle for the multivendor, open systems network
management arena.
    IBM upped that ante a little more this past September, when it
announced several more SystemView developments, including an expanded list
of ''SystemView-conformant'' products from IBM and third-party partners and
a set of criteria for gauging product conformance to SystemView. Although
IBM did not unveil its formal blueprint for SystemView--Systems Management
Architecture (SMA)--in its September 1991 announcements, as it was expected
to do, that introduction should take place within the next year.
    The September 1990 and 1991 announcements don't come close to
revealing the entire SystemView scheme, but they do offer some solid clues
about where IBM expects to take systems management in general--and network
management in particular--in the coming years. How well IBM succeeds in
leading computer and communications technology into the next century
remains to be seen; but the effect that those efforts will have on
corporate information networks will be profound.

BLURRING LINES

    The need for a management architecture that cuts across vendor
lines and embraces as many facets of systems management as possible is
driven by one undeniable fact: The distinctions between computers,
networks, and applications are blurring to the point of irrelevance.
Management responsibilities are widening within specific disciplines as
well. For instance, systems managers can no longer focus solely on
predicting, isolating, tracking, and resolving network problems; they must
also tackle such ''nontechnical'' issues as performance (response-time and
service-level) tracking, capacity planning, asset management, and
configuration management.
    Despite criticism to the contrary, IBM has not been a laggard in
the management arena. It started to embed integrated management features
into SNA as far back as 1977. In that pre-PC era, failures and errors in
large-system communications hardware and in communications links were the
biggest problems for network managers. For that reason, IBM focused on
developing management facilities for monitoring and controlling hardware
rather than applications.
    This original bias toward hardware is evident to this day. Over the
last few years, however, IBM has made a concerted effort to swing its
emphasis to the application side. NetView, introduced in 1986, is part of
IBM's push to expand network management beyond hardware. NetView is now the
predominant network management system for System/370 SNA networks.
    IBM's efforts in the 1980s to move beyond hardware management were
not limited to NetView. IBM brought together all of SNA's management
facilities in 1986, in a standalone, subordinate architecture known as
SNA/Management Services (SNA/MS). Still, IBM's aspirations for management
far exceed what is available with NetView today or even postulated in the
latest revision of SNA/MS.

GRAND ENTRANCE

    Enter SystemView. IBM introduced its systems management vision in a
massive September 1990 coming-out party that featured nearly 150 products
relating to the launching of the System/390 range of computers. The
SystemView announcement was a daring, and probably premature, move by IBM
to articulate its long-term objectives for multivendor systems management.
    In the SystemView introduction, IBM revealed a number of long-term
systems management goals, including the following: Improvements in the
usability of its systems management control programs; Consistent
definitions of resources to be managed; Consistent access to, and
management of, resource definition data; Compliance with open systems
standards, such as the International Organization for Standardization's
(ISO's) common management information services (CMIS) and common
management information protocol (CMIP) standards; Automation of management
tasks whenever appropriate; Provision of management application program
interfaces (APIs) to ensure customer and third-party participation and
integration; Provision of relevant support applications, such as SAA Asset
Manager/MVS, one of the few SystemView applications to be released by IBM.
    All these objectives are similar to, and no doubt inspired by, the
goals that IBM spelled out for SAA back in 1987.
    This past September, a year after SystemView's introduction, IBM
kept the ball rolling with another high-profile announcement, introducing
more SystemView products and its lineup of SystemView product development
partners (see Table 1). It also released a preliminary draft of SystemView
conformance guidelines (see Table 2).

WAITING FOR AN ARCHITECTURE

    Of course, before SystemView can become a reality, it needs an
actual foundation. SystemView's architecture, known in IBM circles as the
Systems Management Architecture, was supposed to have been delivered by
now; its debut has been pushed back to 1992. The delay is troublesome but
understandable given the scope of IBM's undertaking.
    When it is completed, SMA--and thus SystemView--will enable SAA,
AIX (IBM's Unix), DOS/VSE, and other IBM hosts, as well as non-IBM systems,
to be configured, controlled, and monitored across SNA, OSI, and TCP/IP
networks (see Figure 1).
    The September 1991 SystemView announcements included two
developments with important ramifications for network managers. One is
IBM's implicit integration of NetView into the SystemView framework. The
other is management support for heterogeneous LANs.
    Enhancements to NetView Version 2, such as S/390 Automation
Services and extended graphical capabilities announced in September, now
carry the SystemView imprimatur. The NetViewinfusion adds immediate
credibility to SystemView. It also means that users won't have to worry
about backing the wrong management horse.
    NetView already addresses some of SystemView's basic objectives,
although with an emphasis on network management. These include problem
management, response time monitoring, inventory tracking, and software
distribution. NetView also has rudimentary compatibility with SNMP, the
open network management standard for TCP/IP networks.
    NetView should provide a useful nucleus around which to expand
SystemView--at least for the time being. At some point, however, NetView,
with its heavy SNA orientation, will have to undergo some fundamental
changes to conform with all SystemView goals.
    IBM ultimately may decide to phase out its NetView products and
replace them with more robust SystemView counterparts. Although it debuted
in 1986, NetView evolved from a series of vintage 1970s network management
products, such as Network Communications Control Facility (NCCF), Network
Problem Determination Application (NPDA), and Network Logical Data Manager
(NLDM). The overlap between some ''value-added'' SystemView and NetView
offerings, such as the SAA Delivery Manager and the NetView Delivery
Manager, suggests that IBM may be thinking about replacing its NetView
offerings with SystemView equivalents.
    Beyond NetView, network management support for heterogeneous LANs
comes in the latest release of Advanced Communications Function/Virtual
Telecommunications Access Method (ACF/VTAM). Version 3, Release 4 of
ACF/VTAM, through the 3172 Interconnect Controller, now accommodates SNA
traffic over Token-Ring, Token-Bus, fiber distributed data interface
(FDDI), and carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection
(CSMA/CD) LANs alongside TCP/IP traffic. This support, which incorporates
the 3172's fiber optic Enterprise System Connection (Escon) channel
connection, allows ACF/VTAM hosts to interact with LANs up to 5.6 miles
away at up to 10 Mbyte/s, the direct channel rate.
    The SNA and TCP/IP support, coupled with the OSI support that IBM
plans to offer via OSI/Communications Subsystem (OSI/CS), elevates IBM to
being a prime, if not the only, vendor that can offer a heterogeneous
communications system comprising LANs, WANs, integrated SNA, TCP/IP, and
OSI. With ACF/VTAM 3.4, its other communications subsystem software, and
existing NetView technology, IBM at least has the makings of the
communications infrastructure it will need to realize at least the SNA,
TCP/IP, and OSI network management aspects of SystemView.
    IBM's protocol repertoire should expand even further next month,
assuming the introduction of its first multiprotocol router comes off as
planned. The router, which will be based on IBM's RS/6000 workstation, is
likely to accommodate such non-IBM LAN protocols as Novell Inc.'s Internet
Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX), DECnet, and
AppleTalk.

SYSTEMVIEW'S THREE DIMENSIONS

    In its SystemView outlines to date, IBM has defined its management
strategy in terms of three interrelated elements that it calls dimensions:
the end-use dimension, the application dimension, and the data dimension
(see Figure 2). These three dimensions are analogous to SAA's Common User
Access (CUA), Common Programming Interface, and Common Communications
Support components. Like SAA's components, SystemView's three dimensions
will provide relevant guidelines, standards, architectures, and application
program interfaces (APIs) for integrating systems management applications.
    The end-use dimension will set the criteria for providing
workstation users with a consistent and uncomplicated view of SystemView
applications. It will define the guidelines for a common interface to be
used by all systems management applications. The criteria defined in this
dimension will ensure that SystemView meets its improved usability
objective. The end-use dimension is oriented toward iconic, object-based,
point-and-click technology. It is based on an SAA CUA interface that will
be implemented on programmable workstations (IBM PS/2s).
    It now appears that the SystemView end-use dimension will be
implemented on top of IBM's OS/2-based GraphicsView/2 product, which was
announced in September 1990 and is slated to be released by the end of
this year. GraphicsView/2 facilitates the display of system and network
configurations using color-coded status designations. The Graphic Monitor
Facility of NetView Version 2, Release 1, though not based on
GraphicsView/2, offers a relatively faithful preview of what will be
available with GraphicsView/2.
    SystemView's application dimension will set the criteria for
implementing and integrating systems management applications. It will
specify the services and interfaces needed to control, coordinate, and
operate heterogeneous, enterprise-wide information systems. This dimension
has six distinct disciplines: business management, change management,
configuration management, operations management, performance management,
and problem management. IBM has said it will define the application
dimension criteria in such a way as to promote the implementation of
systems management applications to address the various disciplines that
will cross operating system and network boundaries.
    The data dimension will define the requirements for the consistent
definition of resources and the consistent access to such data. To do so,
it will rely on a data model that will use the SAA Database Access
Interface, a Structured Query Language (SQL) interface. The model will be
compatible with the ISO's 10165-4 guidelines for the definition of managed
objects and the 10165-1 management information model.

THE FASTSERVICE FACTOR

    One IBM offering that is emerging as an important component of
SystemView is the Failure Analysis and Support Technology Service, or
FASTService. Introduced in August 1990, FASTService comprises
methodologies, software, hardware, and dedicated customer support--complete
with a toll-free phone line--aimed at finding and resolving as quickly as
possible software problems that arise in S/390 MVS applications.
    FASTService is an innovative and practical offering that in a sense
characterizes the leading-edge, total spectrum management philosophy
embodied in SystemView. It offers facilities to ''trap'' problems the
instant they occur; automatically log problems with a unique identifier to
a user-specified database; produce customized storage dumps; automatically
notify a remote support group; and automatically search a database for
possible resolutions to the problem.
    FASTService is based on the use of IBM-supplied ''software
probes.'' Application developers insert these probes--
which are in the form of S/370 Assembler, Cobol, or PL/1 macros--at
critical points within the application. A probe is triggered whenever it is
encountered in the execution path of the application; thus, probes are
inserted in error or unexpected paths within the application. When
triggered, the software code associated with the probe performs a set of
services specified for that probe. These services can include the
generation of a code dump, the issuance of a NetView alert, or the
invocation of a search process to determine if a resolution has already
been posted for the problem associated with that probe. The benefits of
such automated technology are so compelling that IBM itself intends to use
it in its future strategic products.
    FASTService has yet to be used widely and is now available as a
service within the United States only. It also is fairly expensive right
now. But it does offer the very tangible benefit of significantly reducing
the time and effort needed to debug and maintain large applications,
thereby saving many days, or even months, of programming labor.

THE CURRENT LINEUP

    According to IBM, only two IBM SystemView products are now
available: Workstation Data Save Facility/VM and NetView Graphic Monitor
Facility. About a baker's dozen more IBM products carry the inscrutable
label ''SystemView Conformance Announced.''
    Workstation Data Save Facility/VM is a remote backup application
based on the client-server model. It permits workstations running under
DOS, OS/2, or AIX to back up data on a central S/3X0 host running under VM.
The idea of using host computers as hyper file servers for data backup,
archiving, and retrieval is a sound one. For more than three decades, users
have been backing up and archiving S/3X0 host data, in some cases nightly.
Hence, there's a wealth of proven products, tools, procedures, policies,
and trained personnel in place to perform this crucial function on a
regular basis.
    The NetView Graphic Monitor Facility (NGMF) is an intrinsic feature
of NetView 2.1. It offers the graphical user interface of OS/2 Extended
Edition 1.2, with color-coded status messages. NGMF also provides
multilevel or hierarchical views of the complete network. A ''zoom-in''
feature gives the network operator an expanded view of either a portion of
the network or of individual components, such as Network Control Program
(NCP) Type 4 nodes or peripheral node physical units.
    This past September, IBM enhanced NGMF to include multivendor
support through what appears to be an ASCII emulation facility. NGMF now
addresses two key objectives of SystemView: Its user interface is compliant
with SystemView's end-use dimension, and it handles multivendor systems.
    Among the products labeled as ''SystemView Conformance Announced,''
the SAA Delivery Manager (DM) originally was hailed as a quintessential
SystemView product. SAA DM is a centralized software, document, and file
distribution service for networked OS/2 workstations. Its functions are
somewhat analogous to those of NetView DM, which offers delivery services
to PCs, AS/400s, S/36s processors, and VM hosts, among other IBM systems.
    The differences between SAA DM and NetView DM are intriguing. SAA
DM offers software license management and virus detection software
integration, workstation-oriented features that NetView DM now lacks. But
NetView DM works with a wider range of devices, including just about all
the strategic SAA remote platforms, while SAA DM works only with OS/2
workstations. All things considered, NetView DM appears to be the stronger
of the two products.
    IBM has acknowledged the overlap between SAA DM and NetView DM.
However, it has not specified any guidelines as to which product is more
strategic, or when to use one as opposed to the other. But most of IBM's
key SAA software development partners already have pledged their support to
SAA DM.
    SAA Asset Manager (AM) appears to be an initial implementation of
the business management discipline in SystemView's application dimension.
It provides an open database definition scheme that can be used to collect
data about all of an enterprise's resources in a central repository, as
well as a centralized, automated inventory management service for hardware,
software, and other resources.
    There is an obvious and acute need for such asset control in
distributed environments. However, just as with SAA DM, the announcement of
SAA AM begs a coexistence question. For the past two years, IBM has been
creating an asset tracking service, albeit for hardware only, for NetView
through its Network Asset Management facility. In this case, however, IBM
appears to have spotted the potential overlap between the SAA and NetView
offerings. Just before SAA AM was scheduled to ship, IBM pushed back the
release date of the product because of ''customer feedback.''
    On the positive side, SAA AM--when it becomes available--will
handle inventory management for any software distributed via SAA DM. This
is a clear signal that IBM is serious about tightly integrating all
SystemView applications.
    Both SAA DM and SAA AM rely on a new MVS and VM host-based product
called SAA Application Connection Services (AConnS). AConnS extends the
OS/2 EE Desktop Manager, icon, and resource manipulation environment to
embrace mainframe applications andresources. It lets users of OS/2
workstations directly invoke host applications and gives them direct access
to host-attached advanced function printers. With AConnS, an OS/2 user can
execute multiple applications concurrently, on separate windows. Such
applications can be any combination of local PS/2 applications, Logical
Unit 6.2 (SAA) cooperative processing applications, or 3270-based
(LU-to-LU) applications.

IBM PULLS SAA
OUT OF THE MIRE

By:
Anura Guruge, BBN Communications

There sure were times when IBM appeared unsure as to exactly what it wanted
to achieve with SAA, its proposed model for next-generation client-server
computing. But IBM never lost sight of the fact that both it and its
customers were in dire need of such a model.
    That's why Big Blue never seriously contemplated ditching SAA, as
so many industry analysts predicted. In fact, Big Blue has continually, if
not diligently, striven to strengthen SAA's technical infrastructure and
bolster its credibility. Its September 11 product blowout (over 100
products and services) is certainly in that tradition: 40 percent of that
blockbuster revolved around SAA. (The SystemView announcement is discussed
in detail on page 99.)
    From its 1987 inception, SAA had the basic framework and the right
repertoire of services to be a solid architectural platform for developing
IBM-centric applications. What got it into trouble was IBM's initial
preoccupation with promoting it as the means of attaining that holy grail
of contemporary computing: cross-platform application portability. Given
that the standard execution environment needed to achieve this portability
is only now beginning to appear, IBM's preemptive posturing left it with
lots of egg on its face. The embarrassing slips in the availability of
OfficeVision Version 2, dubbed the first SAA application, did nothing to
bolster SAA's credibility.
    Much to its credit, IBM has been successful in pulling SAA out of
the mire. The aforementioned September 11 extravaganza did a great deal to
dispel lingering doubts and reassert SAA's strategic significance. The
message is clear: SAA is here to stay and is set to follow in the
illustrious footsteps of SNA and the S/370 Principles of Operation.
    The three overriding precepts of the new SAA, which I've taken to
calling SAA Mark II, are client-server, workstation-host cooperative
processing; unrestricted transparent access to widely dispersed data; and
total system management of heterogeneous environments.
    This trio is key to realizing the workstation-based integrated
LAN/WAN computing model advocated by IBM and others. The entire
paradigm--from the design of the iconic user interfaces to the mechanisms
that permit consistent, reversible updates of multiple distributed
databases--is now synthesized, articulated, and implemented within the
context of SAA.
    The availability of SAA's Common Programming Interface for
Communications (CPI-C) across all six SAA platforms (MVS, VM, OS/400, OS/2,
CICS, and IMS) is a big step. At long last, a standard interprogram
communications service with the same API can be found on multiple
platforms.
    In parallel, major strides have been made in harnessing the
capabilities of the pivotal Distributed Relational Database Architecture
(DRDA), which has been part of SAA since 1988. DRDA specifies the protocols
with which a single transaction can access or update multiple, distributed,
remote databases. It also supplies fail-safe mechanisms to ensure the
integrity of all databases in the event that a transaction needs to be
rolled back.
    With the widespread use of DRDA and its file-oriented counterpart,
Distributed Data Management (DDM), it is possible to see a decline in the
indiscriminate file transfers routinely performed in IBM environments. But
the real problem associated with moving data, ignoring the vast amounts of
network and disk capacity consumed, is the loss of data synchronization and
security.
    DRDA makes it possible to access and update a single copy of any given
database in situ, irrespective of location or dispersion. Performance,
relative to local access, is the one drawback. The move toward networks
based on high-speed LANs interconnected by bridges and routers and the
steady decline in the cost of high-capacity WAN bandwidth, however, should
minimize this.
    A limited DRDA capability was announced on IBM's DB2 and VM SQL/DS
in September 1990, enabling a transaction to freely access multiple
databases but only update one. This September, a similar facility was
offered for the OS/2 Database Manager. Now an OS/2 user can access or
update relational databases on MVS, VM, and OS/400 hosts, treating those
databases as if they were local. While the exact future of OS/2 is murky,
it remains a major platform, and the DRDA facility gives it a compelling,
competitive edge.
    The Information Warehouse (IW), also announced in September, goes
even further in extending DRDA to non-IBM databases. Platform-independent
database manipulation is obviously of strategic interest to the large
number of IBM customers who are locked into IBM long-
term but starting to experiment with distributed databases available on
Unix open systems. IW, at least in theory, permits all such databases to be
transparently integrated.
    IW narrows the gap between SAA and Network Application Support
(NAS) from Digital Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.). A few years ago, NAS
and SAA, despite their obvious parallels, could not be accurately compared.
SAA was restricted to IBM platforms and appeared to be very
application-centric, while NAS was network-centric and geared to
integrating applications and data resident on diverse platforms on a DEC
server.
    With IW and its various interoperability ''viaducts'' (IBM lingo
for gateways) to Unix/AIX systems, SAA is slowly but surely attempting to
become more oriented toward open systems. There have been many hints from
IBM over the past couple of years that it intends to draw SAA and AIX even
closer together, cross-pollinating the two technologies. The inclusion of
the Open System Foundations's Unix-based Distributed Computing Environment
(DCE) within SAA is evidence of this move. It hasn't happened yet, but it
can't be too far away. The result would be SAA Mark III--an ''open'' SAA
that could stretch across SAA and Unix platforms.
    IW also furnishes more evidence of SAA's newfound respectability.
The hype that has accompanied earlier SAA adjuncts has been conspicuously
absent. This is a far cry from the IBM once determined to gain a clear
market lead, the one that charged ahead with the aggressive promotion of
SAA concepts and products with scant attention to maturity or
availability.
    In each case, this shoot-from-the-hip approach did more damage than
good. At least with IW it appears that the lessons learned so far are being
put into practice.
    All in all, SAA has come a long way in its four and a half years.
At a comparable age, SNA was just getting around to supporting its first
multihost networks. That was 13 years ago.
    Instead of writing off SAA, we'd be better off taking a closer
look--and the September 11 announcements are a good place to start. And
since I was responsible for dismissing SAA as the Hubble Telescope of the
computer industry, it's only appropriate that I take the lead in admitting
that where SAA is concerned, IBM has regained its focus.

START YOUR ENGINES FOR IMPROVED SNA PERFORMANCE

By:
Joe Mohen, Contributing Editor

In the racing pits of Indianapolis, a crew can change four tires, pump 40
gallons of fuel, and add an aerodynamic spoiler in nine seconds flat. Each
crew prides itself on the tricks it develops to squeeze the most work into
the least time. There's even a contest among pit crews, separate from the
car races, to determine who's fastest.
    Networking professionals are no different: They, too, devote
endless hours to shaving a second here or there off procedures like file
transfers. There aren't any formal competitions, but maybe there should be:
One of the most frequently traveled pathways, the SNA micro-to-
mainframe link, continues to be dogged by sluggish performance.
Off-the-shelf products can help turbocharge throughput, but the lesson
we've learned here at Team Mohen is that there's no link that wouldn't
benefit from some fine-tuning.
    Five years ago, most of us were happy just to be able to download
host files to our PCs, regardless of how long it took. Today it's a
different story. It's not uncommon for companies to quit using first-
generation micro-to-mainframe products because of their poor file transfer
rates. In one extreme case, a large U.S. bank went back to mailing floppy
disks because it took such a ridiculously long time to download
spreadsheets via modem.
    Another company, a large proxy house, had a production application
that required it to download an entire DB2 database, several gigabytes
long, to a file server every night. The only problem was that each
''nightly'' download took 27 hours! Obviously, that kind of rate is
unacceptable.
    The file transfer products in use at that time achieved throughputs
of only around 8 kbit/s. That's excruciatingly slow, considering that
thetoken ring adapter cards in the user's 3174 communications controllers
were running at 4 Mbit/s. Put another way, an average file transfer ran at
1/500th of the network data rate.

A TUNE-UP GOES A LONG WAY

    This user realized dramatic improvements in throughput by following
a few simple steps. The first thing was to correct the things that were
radically wrong with the environment:
Not using LU 6.2 for SNA batch transmissions. The protocol used by 3270
terminals, Logical Unit Type 2 (LU 2), is the worst possible choice for
file transfer. LU 2 limits message size--and thus the amount of information
it can transfer at a time--to one screen (usually 1,920 bytes). Sending
larger records means sending multiple messages. Worse, LU 2 requires the
receiving PC to acknowledge each message by emulating an ENTER keystroke
each time a screen is sent. Moreover, 3270 terminals cannot receive certain
binary strings, which means additional superfluous information has to be
sent to achieve data transparency. All in all, LU 2 imposes far too much
overhead for file transfers.
    Switching to the LU 6.2 protocol allowed messages of up to 32
kbytes to be sent without restriction. This alone quadrupled the
throughput.
Not using large token ring frame sizes. On this user's local token rings,
it took almost as much time to send a small message as it did a large one.
That's because the user had set a 265-byte maximum on each message, or
''frame'' as it's called at the data link level. We increased the frame
size to 1,929 bytes, and here the payoff was really impressive: Typically,
throughputs showed fourfold or fivefold increases. Over the wide area, the
improvement is more modest (usually it's in the 15 percent range), but it's
an improvement all the same. (Newer token ring boards now have enough
memory to support frames as large as 4 kbytes.)
Not using a fast processor. The speed of the local computer can be a major
factor in determining micro-to-mainframe throughput. If you want fast
transmissions, don't even think of using an 8088 or 80286.
Not using segmenting. Unlike the OSI model, which guarantees transparency
by isolating each of the seven layers from one another, IBM's SNA mixes
control information from three high-level layers into a single message
called a Request Unit (RU). In the vast world of IBM connectivity, the size
of the RU is the single most important parameter when it comes to
fine-tuning a link.
    As a rule, it pays to make the RU larger than the frame size. This
forces the RU messages to be broken into multiple frames in a process
called ''segmenting'' that boosts throughput. For this user--
and, in fact, for every other installation I've seen--segmenting produced a
50 percent boost in throughput on a LAN link and a 15 percent improvement
across an SDLC connection. Segmenting remains one of the best-kept secrets
of link tuning.
    When we were finished at this site, we got the user's transmission
time down from 27 hours to less than one hour. Effective throughput was
approximately 360 kbit/s--and that was without segmenting. When we employed
segmenting, throughput rose above the 500-kbit/s mark. The
micro-to-mainframe speeds that you're getting today are probably less than
a quarter of that.
    That's not to say there isn't any room left for improvement. Since
then, we've boosted throughput on 4-Mbit/s token ring LANs to more than 1
Mbit/s by using the very fast 3174-11 controller. This device is three
times faster than its predecessor, the 3174-011.
    Some of the things that seemingly would speed throughput can
actually slow it down. A good example is adaptive data compression. When
used with a slow processor, adaptive compression algorithms consume so many
processing cycles that throughput can actually decline, even though there's
less data to send. This problem isn't limited to low-end 8088 and 80286
machines; I've also found it to be true of certain minis, such as IBM's
System 36 and DEC's MicroVAX.
    I'm not suggesting by any meansthat compression should always be
turned off. But it does play an important role in throughput, and network
managers should check to see how it affects throughput before they set it
and forget it.

DO TRY THIS AT HOME

    Before fine-tuning your own token ring environment, first try to
determine what your optimum throughput can be. Right now, I believe the
optimum throughput using 3174 4-Mbit/s Token Ring Interface Controller is
about 1 Mbit/s, as described earlier. For a 3745 4-Mbit/s controller, the
upper limit is faster than 1 Mbit/s. In either event, you'll probably need
LU 6.2 to achieve these numbers.
    So should you run out and buy a 3745 to replace your 3174? Not
necessarily. The 3172 token ring interface is faster than either. And since
the 3172 can handle OSI and TCP as well as SNA, there's no longer a good
reason to buy those older alternatives. The embarrassing thing about the
3172 is that it's basically a $35,000 PS/2. McData Corp. (Broomfield,
Colo.) offers a strong alternative to the 3172 with prices in the low 20s.
    In the not-too-distant future, I believe throughput will approach
wire speeds. An IBM lab already has achieved rates of better than 3.8
Mbit/s on a 4-Mbit/s token ring using Network Services/2. And within five
years, we're likely to see wire speeds on 16-Mbit/s token ring LANs. Until
we see that checkered flag, though, there's still plenty of fine-
tuning to be done.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY

The DATA COMM User Survey on SNMP multivendor network management systems
comprised a two-page questionnaire and incentive mailed to a random sample
of 2,500 subscribers on July 8, 1991. Results are based on 175 valid
responses. The questionnaire listed 25 products from 24 vendors, with space
left for write-in mentions.
    Users were asked to rank their SNMP systems in order of importance
in their networks, number 1 being most important. Only products that were
ranked first or second in importance by more than 15 respondents were
included in the final tabulations. The ''Other'' category comprises
write-in candidates only; it does not include systems that drew fewer than
15 responses as the first or second most important products. Users then
were asked to rate their two most important SNMP systems in 14 technology
categories and in five service categories. The following scale was used: 5
= Excellent; 4 = Very Good; 3 = Good; 2 = Fair; and 1 = Poor. Users also
were asked to select a ratio that best described how they valued technology
versus service. They also were asked to describe the size of their
networks, the way they were using SNMP systems to manage network devices,
and the importance they would place on SNMP in managing their networks.
    Mean scores were calculated for each question by multiplying the
frequency of each rating by its value and dividing the result by the total
number of questions in either the technology or service categories. The
mean scores in both categories were then weighted according to the mean
percentage of importance given by the respondents--70 percent for
technology, and 30 percent for service. Winners in each category were
chosen after the weighted scores in both categories were averaged.
    Twenty products did not garner enough responses to be included in
the final tabulations. These were: the ACS 4800 from Advanced Computer
Communications (Santa Barbara, Calif.); the NetCentral Station from Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.); the ExpressView system from David
Systems Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif.); the Eye*Node from Digital Analysis Corp.
(Reston, Va.); the DECmcc Management Station for Ultrix from Digital
Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.); the MONET system, formerly the HLS 9100,
from Hughes LAN Systems (Mountain View, Calif.); the Lance Network
Management System now offered by Micro Technology Inc.'s Lexcel subsidiary
(Fullerton, Calif.); the NCRNet Manager, provided on a request basis by
AT&T (New York) and formerly sold by NCR Corp. (Dayton, Ohio); the
DualManager from Netlabs Inc. (Los Angeles); the Series 5000 from Network
Equipment Technologies Inc. (NET, Redwood City, Calif.); the OverView
system from Proteon Inc. (Westborough, Mass.); the LANcentral Express from
Racal-InterLan (now Racal-Datacom Inc., Sunrise, Fla.); the MultiMan system
from RAD Network Devices Inc. (RND, Huntington Beach, Calif.); the 5025
Network Management Center from Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.); the LattisNet
Network Management System from SynOptics Communications Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.); the TIME/LAN 100 Element Management System from Timeplex Inc.
(Woodcliff Lake, N.J.); the NetDirector from Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.); the WANmanager from Vitalink Communications Corp. (Fremont,
Calif.); the Wellfleet SNMP-NMS from Wellfleet Communications Inc.
(Bedford, Mass.); and the Management Station from The Wollongong Group Inc.
(Palo Alto, Calif.).

THE BENEFITS--AND DRAWBACKS--
OF GROWING YOUR OWN

Since SNMP's introduction in 1988, information about the protocol has been
readily available to Internet users, and the source code has been offered
from vendors such as Performance Systems International Inc. (PSI, Reston,
Va.). Armed with this code, users can design and build their own SNMP
management systems--and according to the DATA COMM User Survey, that's
exactly what some respondents have done. Since most commercial SNMP systems
are just barely out of the gate, homegrown systems have been an attractive
alternative in these early days of SNMP.
    ''We just didn't find exactly what we wanted in commercial systems
when we looked at them last year,'' says Ron M. Hoffmann, assistant network
manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Mass.).
Hoffmann says his group found products that looked like they'd perform well
in smaller networks, but not in a setup the size of MIT's. That network
comprises more than 4,000 Ethernet nodes attached to a fiber distributed
data interface (FDDI) backbone and segmented by Cisco routers.
    The MIT group used software from NYSERNet Inc. (Syracuse, N.Y.) to
construct Unix-based SNMP tools that perform a number of functions, among
them turning specific nodes on and off and gathering information from
routers and repeaters in the network.
    The difficulty of constructing an SNMP management system from
scratch may be one reason why the customized systems didn't fare as well in
the overall ratings as the commercial systems did. In ease of
customization, however, the Other group ranked fourth with a score of 3.30,
after Hewlett-Packard, DEC, and Novell, and before Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Cabletron Systems Inc. The obvious conclusion: If you develop your own
software, it's easier to modify it.--M.J.

USERS RATE SNMP MULTIVENDOR NETWORK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
In a new market, users are still
figuring out what SNMP management
can do for them

By:
Mary Jander, Data Communications

Vendors of network management systems may proclaim this the Age of SNMP
Management Over Every Last Device on Earth, but according to the DATA COMM
User Survey of SNMP multivendor management systems, that just isn't the
case--at least not yet.
    To be sure, network managers would love to control many different
devices, from many different vendors, with a single, easy-
to-use system. Survey respondents believe simple network management
protocol systems will bring that dream closer to reality. They're quick to
add, however, that the systems are simply too new and their experience with
them too limited for anyone to declare that SNMP management of multivendor
networks is an essential, or even widely accepted, part of networking.
    Many readers are still in the process of evaluating one or more
systems on isolated network segments. Indeed, almost half of the 320
readers who responded to the DATA COMM survey haven't even gotten to the
testing stage yet, although most say they plan to use SNMP systems in the
future.
    One reason for users' general lack of experience with SNMP systems
is that these systems are relatively new: Novell Inc.'s LANtern Services
Manager shipped in March 1991; DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module
became available in November 1990; Cabletron Systems Inc.'s Remote
LANview/Windows was first equipped with SNMP management capabilities in
July 1990, although it debuted in September 1989; HP's Network Node Manager
shipped in May 1990; and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s SunNet Manager shipped in
March 1990, making this 21-month-old program the most venerable in the
field.
    Even the simple network management protocol itself is fairly new.
Devised in 1988 by Internet scientists to manage devices in TCP/IP
networks, SNMP has not been extended far beyond its original charter.
Several Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) groups are working on
extensions that will allow SNMP to manage more types of devices, but it
will take time for these improvements to filter down to users.
    While many survey respondents had yet to make a final commitment to
a single SNMP system, they did seem pleased with the current crop of
products. The five systems that made the final tabulation rarely rated
below a score of Good, and no system ranked less than Fair in any category.
Because the scores were so close, and because many of the systems were
still being evaluated, DATA COMM selected just one
winner--Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager.
    HP's product fared well in both technology and service ratings,
achieving the highest overall score and the top ranking in the technology
categories. Notably, the Network Node Manager scored solid ratings where
other systems stumbled, particularly in categories such as management
information base (MIB) extensibility and utilities, a key area for
multivendor network management. HP's product also did well in degree of
automation, availability and quality of user-defined reporting facilities,
emergency support, and application development and systems integration
services.
    Digital Equipment Corp.'s DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module
garnered the second-highest overall score. It had the top ratings in the
service categories, leading all other vendors in documentation, maintenance
and repair, and training.
    DEC's solid service record was unusual: The other systems included
in the ratings did better in technology than in service. Scores were
highest in the technology categories of ease of use, ease of installation,
and overall system performance (see Table 1).

TIES THAT BIND

    Despite the newness of the systems, the survey did reveal some
clear patterns among users of SNMP systems:
Many users acquired their systems mainly because they already had equipment
from the system vendor--Cabletron hubs, for instance, or Novell LANs--
even though all the systems surveyed are billed as multivendor managers.
Most were looking at other products too, and many were investigating the
possibilities of altering or customizing their existing systems with the
help of vendors or consultants.
Users haven't yet harnessed the full power of their management systems.
Many survey respondents said they rely on their systems only to report
trouble, even though the systems also perform trend analysis and active
monitoring. When the network is running smoothly, many respondents simply
ignore their SNMP systems. Part of the blame for users' lack of awareness
rests with the vendors, which according to users could do a better job of
bringing them up to speed on their technology.
Workstations and PCs are by far the most common type of device managed,
according to nearly four-fifths of survey respondents (see Table 2). The
second most widely managed class of devices is LAN servers, by 59.22
percent of users.
Besides the users who were still testing their systems, many said they are
undecided or ambivalent about keeping their SNMP management systems
permanently.
SNMP is gaining the most ground in small networks and in portions of larger
ones. Users are trying out SNMP systems in departments or selected LAN
segments before adopting them throughout their enterprises.
    Fully 68 percent of users surveyed said they were using SNMP
systems to manage less than 10 sites. Another 9.7 percent are using SNMP to
manage from 11 to 20 sites, and only 8 percent are using SNMP to manage
more than 21 sites. The mean of all responses was just 10.1 sites.
    The number of devices managed at these sites is also small. Nearly
half of all respondents, 48.6 percent, said they manage less than 50
devices with an SNMP system. Less than a quarter of respondents, 22.3
percent, manage 50 to 100 devices with an SNMP system; 15.4 percent manage
100 to 500 devices, 7.4 percent manage 500 to 1,000 devices, and just 4.0
percent said they manage more than 1,000 devices. The mean number of
devices managed is 185.1.
Network management of all types--not just SNMP--accounts for a relatively
small part of the typical communications budget. Survey respondents said
only 32.1 percent of their budgets goes toward network management, with 12
percent of this devoted to salaries for network management personnel, 11.6
percent allocated to the management systems themselves, and 8.5 percent
assigned to management services, including outsourcing.

THE DAWN OF MULTIVENDOR SUPPORT

    Support of multiple vendors' internetworking gear is still a
relatively new feature, and one that few survey respondents had explored at
any great length.
    Until this spring, all of the products listed were capable of
supporting only basic SNMP alarm information from nonproprietary gear.
Although most vendors could and would add support for other vendors' MIBs
on a custom basis, most systems only understand MIB I, the set of general
definitions that describe a device's functions to an SNMP system.
    That began changing this year, when vendors started adding MIB
compilers that can accept and manage a range of devices from multiple
vendors. SunNet Manager Release 1.1, which shipped in February, includes a
translation utility that allows users to compile other vendors' MIBs,
including those that include proprietary extensions. Version 2.0 of
Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager, which shipped last spring,
adds a MIB compiler to the system's Application Builder software. The
software accepts any MIB and loads it automatically into the HP system's
graphical user interface.
    DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module currently accepts only
basic alarm and status information from network devices that support MIB I.
DEC says it will offer a MIB compiler with the second release of the SNMP
Access Module, slated to ship by the end of the year. This new release also
will support MIB II and will come with several proprietary MIBs already
incorporated into the system. MIB II supports more types of devices than
MIB I does--most notably T1 transmission devices and a range of LAN media
types--and it provides more extensive management control.
    Novell's LANtern Services Manager also displays only basic alarm
information from non-Novell devices that support MIB I. The LANtern
Services Manager is an interface for Novell's LANtern monitoring device
that oversees one Ethernet segment at a time. The LANtern can send its
information to a range of other SNMP-based systems, including the
Hewlett-Packard and Sun systems. There have been rumors that Novell will
soon offer a MIB compiler for use with the LANtern Services Manager, but
Novell won't confirm this.

SEND HELP

    Users have mixed feelings about how well vendors are helping them
meet specific network management requirements. Most respondents said they
are interested in modifying their SNMP systems to manage more types of
devices, run on a different platform, or perform capabilities generally not
offered by their SNMP system out of the box. These comments send a clear
message to vendors: Send more, and better, help.
    Hewlett-Packard, DEC, and Novell products received relatively good
marks for ease of customization, but all vendors' scores dropped for
database capabilities, availability and quality of user-defined reporting
facilities, and MIB extensibility and utilities. A notable exception was
Hewlett-Packard's score of 3.69 for MIB extensibility and utilities.
    In some instances, users said they'd asked for hands-on assistance
in modifying their systems--a need that was not always met. ''Cabletron
could give us better service in showing us how to adjust the system,'' says
William Vilwock, computer specialist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines field
office in Spokane, Wash. Vilwock's group is using Cabletron's Remote
LANview/Windows on a 114-node Ethernet that comprises local and remote
sites. The group needs to extend the network to incorporate non-Cabletron
WAN equipment, and Vilwock say it's been slow going.
    A user of the Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager also
said he'd like more support. ''HP hasn't been here in over a year,'' said
this technician, who requested anonymity and whose group is using
Hewlett-Packard's product to monitor a 400-node Ethernet network. ''The
Network Node Manager is a reasonably good product that covers the basics
and provides diagnostics. But the graphics aren't that customizable, and
we'd like to add more graphical features.''
    In contrast, another user said Hewlett-Packard was extremely
helpful in showing his organization how to create Unix-based applications
that allow the HP OpenView Network Node Manager to respond to network
problems. ''On a Unix workstation, I can easily program a routine that
activates a beeping pager if something goes wrong,'' says Randy J. Miller,
systems support analyst at Union Carbide Coatings Service Inc.
(Indianapolis). Miller describes his installation as ''an HP shop from way
back.''
    Another user reported that his vendor, DEC, was taking more time
than he'd like in considering changes that he had requested. Dave Dorosz,
systems engineer at Phillips Laboratories (Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford,
Mass.), is using DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module to manage a lab
network containing 10 bridged Ethernet segments comprising DEC bridges and
routers and computers from several vendors. He said his group is satisfied
with the system, but would like more capabilities, including an automatic
node discovery tool--software that is capable of locating and graphically
depicting devices with IP addresses in a network. The group also wants to
monitor network traffic across bridges through the Access Module, instead
of using a separate dedicated DEC LANbridge to collect network traffic
statistics for the DECmcc Director system. The group also would like to
runthe DECmcc Director system and its access modules on a Sun workstation.
    The Phillips Labs group is evaluating a range of other SNMP
systems, not because DEC hasn't been helpful, but because it's simply
taking too long for DEC to decide about adding these functions to its
system, Dorosz says.
    Users clearly want vendors to help them expand their systems, and
many are ready to go elsewhere if they can't get what they need from one
system. In fact, most users contacted were evaluating more than one system
or were thinking about doing so. Some users are willing to create their own
systems to get what they need (see ''The Benefits--and Drawbacks--of
Growing Your Own'').

SERVICE WOES

    As noted, the SNMP systems included in the final tabulation scored
worse in service than in technology categories. The lone exception was the
DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module, the only product to post higher overall
scores for service than for technology. Users' satisfaction with DEC's
service is reflected in first-place ratings for overall service, training,
vendor documentation, and maintenance and repair. One user complimented DEC
on its commitment to service and commented that ''a DEC representative
camps out in our data center when something goes wrong.''
    Hewlett-Packard also did comparatively well in the service
categories, although its showing was not as strong as in the technology
ratings. Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager scored first in
the emergency support category and in application development and systems
integration, and it placed second to DEC in overall service and in
maintenance and repair.
    In follow-up interviews, users' service complaints included gripes
that vendors had sold them a system and then deserted them, relied too much
on third-party support, or provided introductory training and then failed
to deliver adequate help in a pinch.
    Emergency support scores were lower than anywhere else in the
survey ratings, and Novell users were especially vocal. Unlike the other
four vendors, who rely on telephone service or sales reps to perform
maintenance and repairs, Novell relies on third-party consultants, who
charge what they want to for service. Novell maintains a hot-line service,
but if users can't get a problem fixed on the hot-
line, they must rely on these third-party representatives to get the job
done. Some users are unhappy with this setup because it puts them at the
mercy of local services--and the high prices they typically charge.
    One LAN administrator complained that even if she calls the Novell
representative in her area and talks for only 10 minutes, she still must
pay a $75 hourly fee. When trouble hit, it was expensive. ''Novell is great
on training and provides hot-line service for their products, but when our
Novell system needed work, we had to hire the $75-an-hour consultant Novell
assigned to us,'' this user says. The consultant's bill, added to the cost
of network downtime, made this particular repair job an unpleasant
experience.
    Vendor documentation was another weak spot. H.L. Wilson,
information systems manager at the U.S. Naval Air Station (Pensacola, Fla.)
and a user of Novell's LANtern Services Manager, says that documentation
from Novell and other vendors is better than it used to be but not as good
as it should be. ''Sometimes I get instructions that don't match the
version of software I'm using, but seem to have been written before it was
enhanced,'' Wilson says.

FIRST AND LAST

    The highest score in the survey went to Hewlett-Packard: 3.89 for
ease of use. The lowest score in the survey was Cabletron's 2.69 rating for
the service category of application development and systems integration.
    The Cabletron ratings were the most uneven in the survey. They
ranged from a first-place score of 3.83 for ease of installation and a
second-place score of 3.83 for ease of use--two of the highest scores in
the findings--to last-place ratings for ease of customization, degree of
automation, security, and application development.
    Cabletron's latest SNMP system, Spectrum, wasn't listed in the DATA
COMM survey form because it just began shipping when the survey was
conducted and consequently hadn't had time to build up a substantial
installed base (see ''Survey Methodology''). Cabletron says Spectrum does
address the very areas where users felt Remote LANview/Windows is weak.
Application development and systems integration are key functions of
Spectrum, and the vendor already has ported the system to a range of Unix
platforms.
    In fairness, the ease-of-use rating turned out to be uniformly high
for all of the vendors, and the category for application development and
systems integration was similarly low for all.

Best Overall
HP OpenView
Network Node Manager

Top scores in far more categories than any other product gave
Hewlett-Packard the top honors in this DATA COMM User Survey. Introduced in
May 1990, HP's network manager is among the oldest products surveyed and
now is in its second release. It runs on HP workstations under HP/UX and on
Sun Sparcstations under SunOS. HP's software finished first in nine out of
14 technology categories and shared first place with Sun's SunNet Manager
for best graphical user interface. Users particularly liked the product's
MIB extensibility and utilities, which enable them to manage other vendors'
devices.

BILLING FOR LAN INTERNETS:
WHO PICKS UP THE TAB?

By:
Robin Layland, Travelers Insurance Co.

Ah, the joys of internetworking: Now that LANs are no longer strictly local
affairs, it's up to the corporate telecom department to decide who foots
the bill for all that connectivity. But when corporate starts asking
questions about utilization, it's funny how every department or workgroup
suddenly seems to be a ''below average'' user. And they want their bills to
reflect that.
    Strange how the same folks usually seem to be demanding more
bandwidth.
    Since all the parties on the network agree that someone else is
using the network more than them, a simple approach would be to charge
everyone the same amount. This one-bill-fits-all tack is a surefire way to
get everyone equally upset, but it's not going to accomplish much else.
    On SNA installations, bills are tallied using data collected by
performance-monitoring tools such as IBM's NetView Performance Monitor
(NPM). When all those below-average users complain about their charges,
you show them the hard data on utilization.
    But LAN internetworking isn't SNA networking. IBM's NPM doesn't
gather the needed information on network usage, which brings us full
circle: How are internetworking bills to be generated? How do you prove
that some of those below-average users are really above average?
    Obviously, what's needed is a billing data collection system for
internets. But don't run out to your internetwork equipment vendor (whether
it specializes in bridges, routers, or analyzers) and expect to find one.
Even Nick Lippis doesn't have one.
    While it may sound logical for bridge or router vendors to supply
the gear needed to collect billing data, they don't see it that way. In
fact, most don't seem to consider billing an important issue.
    Some router vendors may try to convince you to use their product's
TCP/IP accounting feature, which keeps track of TCP/IP addresses. That's
fine if everyone is using TCP/IP (they aren't) or if a TCP/IP subnet is
directly equal to one billing group. In most cases, though, the subnet is
shared by many departments, and they don't want to see their bills
combined.
    You could solve the problem by adapting something on the market
(like a LAN analyzer) and writing your own billing application. Of course,
you'd probably have to deploy one of these devices on every LAN, which adds
up to more work and expense than most corporate telecom departments want to
get involved in.
    But imagine just for a moment that we've actually convinced
internetworking vendors to solve the billing problem. Before they deliver
the solution, they're going to ask some questions of their own, starting
with: ''What type of billing system do you want?''
    A usage-based system sounds like a good answer, but it's not that
simple.
    There are two basic models for usage-based billing in a LAN internet.
The first is very similar to the way the local telephone company generally
bills its users. There's a set fee that permits an unlimited number of
local calls and a usage-sensitive (and distance-sensitive) charge for
long-distance calls. On an internet, this approach would translate into an
unlimited number of packets within a locally bridged building or campus
and a per- packet charge when communications lines are involved (long
distance).
    With this scheme, a person sending one message to someone on
another floor in the same building would pay the same set monthly fee as
someone who sends a hundred messages to another floor. When communications
lines are employed, there would be a charge for every message. Much like
long-distance calls, the more you send, the more you pay. This model makes
sense because the cost of the bridge or router that ties together local
subnets doesn't vary with the amount of traffic flowing across it. But
communication costs do increase as the amount of data sent increases.
    Thus, a department need only be concerned that its clients and
servers are located within the same bridged building or campus, not that
they are all on the same LAN. Further, users are not restricted as to where
they can be located, as long as they stay within the same locally bridged
area.
    The second approach to usage-based billing is closer to what the
local telephone company would like to do. Users are charged for every call
outside of their LAN. The more any group sends, the more it pays.
    With this approach, keeping costs down means keeping everyone in a
department on the LAN. This can lead to some interesting design challenges:
Departments with people on more than one floor will want all of them on the
same LAN. And when people move, departments will want to make sure they
stay on the same LAN.
    Once network managers have sorted out how to implement a
usage-based scheme, they still have to decide whether the billing rates
will be based on distance.
    A distance-sensitive approach does have some fundamental appeal,
and it's certainly familiar. A long-distance call from New York to Los
Angeles costs more than one from New York to Boston. The communications
line from New York to Los Angeles costs more.
    A distance-sensitive scheme is more important when every message
that leaves the LAN is billed for. Users who send a lot of messages between
floors won't be happy to learn their bills are the same as those for users
who send messages across the country.
    There are drawbacks. It's going to eat up a lot of memory tracking
who sent what to whom. And it's also going to lower performance in packets
per second. Add to this the cost of transmitting all that distance-related
data to the centralized billing system, and a distance-sensitive approach
could quickly run into money. Yes, it can lead to a ''fairer'' billing
system, but the question remains what that fairness is worth.
    It's also possible to use an external monitor to track all the
billing data. Here again, that monitor is going to need enough horsepower
to deal with distance-related data, which means it's going to be a pricey
piece of equipment.
    What's best for each corporation is an individual matter. The
problem is, vendors are not going to develop a different system for every
customer. They're big fans of the one-size-fits-all school of thinking. But
which size is it going to be?
    Making billing-data collection an option in routers is the best
answer. Asking for the distance-sensitive approach is tempting but
impractical. Vendors won't like distance-sensitive billing since it demands
so much storage and affects performance.
    If you believe accounting is important, then the most important
thing to do is ask your vendor to provide it. If they don't know you want
it, they're not going to spend much time trying to figure out how to
implement it.
    One reason that billing hasn't been a hot button for vendors may
simply be because LAN internetworking is still a fairly new idea. But that
attitude will change as LAN internets grow and management demands more
accountability.
    If we don't start telling vendors what we want, though, it's going
to get even harder justifying all the money that goes to internets and
explaining to all those below-average users why they should be paying
average rates.

A COMPLETE INTERNET
IN A SINGLE BOX
ODS's server module puts all networking devices
under one cover

By:
Mary Jander

Mention ''LAN server'' to most network managers and they'll conjure an
image of an oversized PC, probably in a tower case with 18 drive bays.
Mention ''internetworking'' and they'll think of more boxes--bridges,
gateways, routers--not to mention the network management system and snarl
of cables needed to connect them all.
    Optical Data Systems Inc. (ODS) has a better idea: Its ODS
Connection Server modules put multiple 80386-based LAN servers inside the
same box as a hub or token ring multiple access unit (MAU), so all the
equipment needed for local networking resides in a single device no larger
than a desktop PC.
    Up to six server modules can reside in one ODS 295 or 296 Modular
System hub chassis, with up to 350 Mbytes of hard disk storage in each
module. Up to 1.2 Gbytes of disk storage can be added with extra cards.
    The combination of servers, interface cards, and other connectivity
gear in a single box gives network managers another important
benefit--fewer devices to be managed. A optional card furnishes a simple
network management protocol (SNMP) agent that allows all the gear in a hub
to be managed by ODS's LanVision and by third-party SNMP managers. The
card also contains an agent for management by IBM's NetView, but only when
using ODS's token ring network interface cards (NICs). When used in ODS's
841 and 861 MAUs, the Connection Server consolidates all devices needed
for 4- and 16-Mbit/s token ring LANs. Both MAUs can handle fiber optic as
well as copper wiring, and both run under IBM's OS/2-based LAN Manager 2.0
and Token-Ring Bridge Program 2.2.
    Both the hub and the MAU versions of the ODS Connection Server run
under Novell Inc.'s NetWare 3.11, Banyan Systems Inc.'s Vines, IBM's LAN
Server, Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager, and 3Com Corp.'s 3+Open and 3+Share
network operating systems (NOSs).
    Putting the server inside the hub or MAU lets users take advantage
of a wider range of Novell's networking and net management products. For
example, users can plug Novell's Link/T1 and Link/64 WAN cards into the
hub, and at the same time use Novell's SNA gateway and server management
features.
    And by supporting several NOSs, the Connection Server allows
third-party NICs to be added quickly to its hubs. All that's required is
for the cards be compatible with the hubs' PC/AT-based buses.
    Before, the vendor supplied preconfigured, third-party cards for
T1, X.25, SNA, and 56-kbit/s WAN connections. Without ODS's assistance,
users would have to write their own NOS drivers.
    As with the expanded Novell options, the Connection Server cuts
down on card costs by handling any cards for operating systems compatible
with its AT bus. Users can save processing power by putting only the
runtime version of a NOS in the server.
    ODS's all-in-one approach is a novel one. Other hub vendors,
including Cabletron Systems Inc. (Rochester, N.H.), SynOptics
Communications Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), and Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.), provide NICs and other add-in modules only from
manufacturers that have alliances with them.
    In a twist on the ODS concept, Novell (Provo, Utah) plans to announce
an architecture in which a hub card runs inside a NetWare server. While
this is the exact opposite of the ODS design, Novell's architecture will
achieve the same ends--consolidation of networking devices and
improvements in net management.
   Novell apparently plans to help vendors such as Cabletron create hub
cards that can run on a PC/AT bus, thus tapping the PC's power supply, disk
space, and operating system. Novell will show vendors how to write NetWare
Loadable Module (NLM) agents for SNMP management systems and for NetWare
that will let their hubs be managed byNetWare or SNMP. At press time,
Novell said it had already enlisted the support of 19 hub vendors,
including Cabletron and SynOptics, that would build hub cards using the
Novell specs.
    The ODS Connection Server won't meet the needs of every customer.
Since the only generally available processor is a single Intel 20-MHz 80386
to 33-MHz 80386 and maximum disk storage is 1.2 Gbytes, users with
processor-intensive database requirements or applications with large files,
such as CAD/CAM, had best stick with their current servers. ODS says it
will supply 80286 and 80486 processors on special request.
    Joe Head, ODS senior vice president and cofounder, says he hopes
users will adopt a ''Chinese menu'' approach to the ODS Connection Server.
''We want users to just tell us what they need, and we'll put it into the
box,'' Head says.
    Early users of the ODS Connection Server are attracted by its space
savings and, because it consolidates network devices, its ability to make
LANs more manageable.
    At the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School
(Westwood), LAN manager Bill Rollins tested the ODS Connection Server as a
possible means of reducing the number of dedicated servers in the campus
network. The UCLA Medical School network is based in part on a 16-Mbit/s
fiber optic token ring backbone linked by ODS 841 MAUs. Rollins considered
putting the ODS Connection Server into these MAUs, thereby saving users in
smaller departments the cost of purchasing a server.
    Rollins says the option performed well in tests. He says the server
option is particularly good for users who don't know much about
networking--since everything is included in one hub unit, there isn't much
to set up or fuss with.
    Users can manage their ODS hubs and MAUs in several ways. An
optional management agent card contains SNMP agent software for the ODS
295/296 hubs or 841/861 MAUs and NetView agents for the token ring
connections. This card doesn't take up space that could otherwise be
devoted to network interface cards; rather, it fits into a special,
separate slot in the hub or MAU. The card costs about $3,200 for either
type of system. ODS token ring NICs also can send alerts to IBM's
LAN Manager 2.0 program. When IBM ships its LAN Network Manager replacement
for LAN Manager 2.0 next year, alerts from ODS token ring NICs will be sent
to that system, where they can be filtered and consolidated before being
transmitted to NetView.
    ODS also is working on a NetView/PC proxy agent that will run on
the Connection Server and allow ODS hubs to take advantage of NetView/PC
applications from IBM and third parties in the future. ODS's token ring
NICs and bridges can be controlled by the IBM Token-Ring Bridge Program,
just like IBM's own products.
    Each ODS 295/296 hub and 841/861 MAU also has a dedicated slot for a
card with an EIA-232 connection for out-of-band network management and
diagnostics. Out-of-band testing lets users perform troubleshooting even
if a network crashes. Users also can dedicate one of the LAN segments in
the ODS 295 or 296 chassis to handling management information via an ODS
network management card, thus isolating management from any user's data
stream--an attractive option where security is a concern.
    The ODS Connection Server module comes in different versions for
the hub and MAU. The hub version takes up two card slots in an ODS 295 or
296 chassis. Its components are an Intel 80386 processor; 16 Mbytes of RAM;
an Interactive Data Entry (IDE) hard disk controller; a 3.5-inch hard disk
with a capacity of up to 350 Mbytes right on the card; a floppy disk
controller; and controllers and interfaces for a keyboard and VGA monitor.
    The module fits into the 295 or 296 chassis without switching or
rewiring, ODS says. The vendor cautions, however, that users planning to
perform their own upgrades should know how to configure the drivers that
address the various devices in the hub.
    The total number of ports supported depends on how many NICs reside
in thehub chassis along with the Connection Server. If ODS's own NICs are
used exclusively, a 295 or 296 chassis with the Connection Server can house
up to 120 10Base-T ports; up to 80 thin Ethernet ports; up to 60 attachment
unit interface (AUI) ports; or up to 140 fiber optic interrepeater link
(FOIRL) ports. The hubs also can house up to 160 ports on 4- or 16-Mbit/s
token rings using fiber optic or shielded or unshielded twisted-pair copper
wiring. The number of ports available from third-party NICs depends on the
configurations of those cards.
    Server modules for ODS's 841 and 861 occupy three of the five
slots. One card holds the 80386 CPU and 16 Mbytes of RAM; one contains the
keyboard and VGA interface and floppy disk controller; the third houses the
hard disk controller.
    Unlike the ODS hubs, the 841 and 861 MAUs support IBM's Micro Channel
as well as its PC/AT-bus architecture, and ODS offers 4- and 16-Mbit/s
token ring cards for both kinds of buses. However, it's not as easy to
install NICs in the MAUs as it is in the hubs. A screwdriver and some
know-how with DIP switches may be required.

Product Summary
Product Name: ODS Connection Server module.

Description: A full-fledged LAN server for ODS 295 and 296 hubs and ODS 841
and 861 multiple access units (MAUs).

HUBS WITH A FUTURE

By:
Mary Jander

ADC/Fibermux Corp. has added features to its Crossbow line of intelligent
networking hubs that it says will help organizations planning to migrate to
FDDI or simply needing to extend their LANs.
    The new Crossbow Plus hub includes four more I/O slots, more
powerful I/O modules, and higher-capacity power supplies for support of
fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) cards. Crossbow Plus accommodates
up to 14 Fibermux cards, compared to two, four, or 10 cards for older
Crossbow chassis. The vendor says it will use all existing Crossbow cards,
including those supporting Ethernet, token ring, and AppleTalk LANs, as
well as cards supporting Ethernet-to-Ethernet bridging and management via
Fibermux's own LightWatch simple network management protocol (SNMP)
system.
    Crossbow Plus handles up to 210 Ethernet workstations using
Fibermux's new high-density Ethernet I/O modules, which also run in the
older Crossbow hubs. The new hubs come with up to four 25-amp power
supplies, compared with two available for previous models. Along with five
cooling fans, the power supplies will allow the hub to support FDDI in the
future. Crossbow Plus is rack-mountable and measures 17.5 inches high by 15
inches deep. It is scheduled to ship this month for $1,550. Each power
supply module costs $950.
    ADC/Fibermux also announced the CC6613Z/16, a more powerful
Ethernet I/O module for Crossbow hubs that features 16 ports for 10Base-T
connections. The new module fits in all Crossbow hubs, including older
models as well as the Crossbow Plus. Previous Crossbow 10Base-T modules
only handled up to 10 ports. The CC6613Z/16 also is slated to ship this
month for $2,100.
    Finally, ADC/Fibermux announced a mini-hub called the Crossbow
Extend24 that supports workstations in Ethernet star topologies located
more than 330 feet from the main 10Base-T hub. The Extend24 takes the place
of 24 unshielded twisted-pair cables running from the main hub,
ADC/Fibermux says. The unit measures 1.75 by 11.5 inches, and can be
rack-mounted. Two models are available: The first offers a 50-pin telco
connector supporting 24 10Base-T ports, plus attachment unit interface
(AUI) ports for thick and thin Ethernet connections, for $3,200. The second
model furnishes two fiber optic interrepeater link (FOIRL) ports and an AUI
thick Ethernet connector. It costs $3,325. Optional nonvolatile RAM that
stores network configurations and addressing information for either
Extend24 model costs $100. Like the other products, the Extend24 unit is
slated to ship this month.

FIBER AND 10BASE-T HUBS BOW

By:
Mary Jander

Network Resources Corp. (NRC) has added fiber optic and 10Base-T products
to its MultiGate line of intelligent hubs for Ethernet LANs. The fiber hub
conforms to the fiber optic interrepeater link (FOIRL) standard being
developed for IEEE 802.3 Ethernets. The second is a 12-port version of
NRC's existing 10Base-T Ethernet hub with an integral learning/filtering
bridge.
    Both hubs come with the vendor's MultiGate Manager system. NRC says
both support open systems connections, in that both can be managed by a
range of other vendors' systems and both feature backplanes and media
connections that comply with industry standards.
    The MultiGate Intelligent Fiber Optic Hub allows users to connect
other hubs and devices with FOIRL support in a star topology. The hub can
be configured with four, eight, or 12 fiber optic ports. Backbone ports
support thick and thin Ethernet or thin Ethernet and FOIRL.
    The 10-pound hub, which measures 1.75 by 17 by 13.5 inches,
supports 50-, 62.5-, and 100-micron fiber optic cabling at distances of up
to 1.2 miles. It has 32 LED indicators and can be monitored by a dumb
terminal or NRC's MultiGate Manager, which offers alarms, graphics, and
multiwindow monitoring. The hub provides port-by-port event summaries and
historical and real-time reports. The 12-port version of the
IntelligentFiber Optic Hub costs $6,595. An eight-port version costs
$4,995, and a four-port version costs $3,395.
    NRC's 10Base-T hub connects computers over unshielded twisted-pair
wiring in a star topology, and it supports up to 12 Ethernet ports. A
bridge filters traffic between the hub and backbone networks by protocol
and address. The approximate filtering rate for this bridge is 10,000
packets per second, the fowarding rate is 5,000 packets per second. All
aspects of the hub, which is the same size as the FOIRL version, can be
remotely configured using the MultiGate Manager or the hub's external
management port. The hub costs $2,495.

TOKEN RING LINKS FOR DEC ULTRIX

By:
Mary Jander

The ACP 3300 host adapter from ACC Systems connects Digital Equipment Corp.
workstations running under Ultrix directly to a token ring network without
the need for an intermediate server, according to the vendor. The adapter
complies with the IEEE 802.2 and 802.5 standards and works with both 4- and
16-Mbit/s token rings. The ACP 3300 also uses the routing capabilities
built into the Ultrix kernel, enabling a DEC workstation to act as an
Ethernet LAN gateway to the token ring for other computers on the
workstation's native LAN.
    The standalone box comes with a Motorola 68000 processor and 512
kbytes of RAM. Software included with the adapter performs power-up
diagnostics and installation verification. A driver for VAX VMS systems
also is available. The ACP 3300 costs $5,250.

FDDI SPEEDS
ON UTP

By:
Mary Jander

The T100A network adapter from PC Office Inc. matches the performance of
fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) networks by providing data rates of
up to 100 Mbit/s over unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) wiring, according to
the vendor. The adapter is a 16-bit PC card that fits into a half slot on
IBM PCs and compatibles. It is based on the vendor's 6100 LAN chip, which
uses a proprietary technique called Differential Code Modulation to send
data at 100 Mbit/s over distances of up to about 330 feet and at 50 Mbit/s
nearly 650 feet using UTP. The 6100 LAN chip uses FDDI's standard framing
format, the vendor says.
    The T100A comes with two cable connectors, which means the adapters
can be set up in either star or bus configurations. According to PC Office,
the use of shielded twisted-pair wiring can effectively double connection
distances. With signal repeaters, distances over UTP can reach 2,500 feet,
the vendor claims. The adapter costs $595.

SNA, DEC, AND LAN TRAFFIC ON ONE BACKBONE
Netlink also plans to OEM its software to router vendors

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Good news for the guardians of billions of dollars' worth of IBM and DEC
gear: Netlink Inc. has announced three products that let traffic from SNA
and DEC devices share a backbone with PC LANs and Unix workstations using
IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, and AppleTalk protocols.
    Netlink's SDLC Link Server connects IBM gear such as the 3174 and
3274 communications controllers with 3745 front-end processors (FEPs)
across bridged LAN internetworks rather than leased telephone lines. The
Link Server not only simplifies network design but also costs less to
purchase and operate than comparable offerings from IBM.
    Another Netlink product, the Internetwork SNA Gateway, lets Digital
Equipment Corp. VT terminals emulate IBM 3270 terminals and links the VT
terminals to IBM hosts across the same backbone that carries SNA and LAN
traffic.
    Netlink also plans to resell its SNA software, which is based on
code used by Netlink products since 1988, to third-
party vendors--most likely router makers, which in turn will be able to
market routers that support SNA equipment. Sale of the software has
far-reaching potential, since it gives internetworking vendors lacking SNA
expertise a chance to purchase that expertise outright. If enough vendors
buy Netlink's software, the internetworking market could move away from its
current state of confusion toward greater interoperability and even a de
facto standard.
    The SDLC Link Server connects 3X74 controllers to 3745 FEPs by
converting the synchronous data link control (SDLC) data stream generated
by the controllers to the Logical Link Control 2 (LLC2) protocol sanctioned
by the IEEE for token ring LANs (see figure). The IBM method of linking
3174 controllers to remote FEPs across a LAN internetwork calls for users
to install a 3174 Token-Ring Interface Coupler (TIC) in the controller. The
TIC lets the controller communicate over a token ring LAN using LLC2. Other
IBM communications gear, such as bridges and gateways, also use LLC2. But
there's one big drawback: LLC2 is not a routable protocol, so routers used
in LANs cannot direct LLC2 traffic. Routers equipped with Netlink's SNA
software, however, will be able to direct traffic from SDLC Link Server.
    As noted, the IBM approach also costs more. A single 3174 TIC costs
$3,745, while an SDLC Link Server supporting two 3174s costs $6,490. The
savings grow as SDLC Link Servers are used to connect more 3174s. A 16-port
SDLC Link Server costs $23,000, while 16 IBM 3174 TICs would run $59,920.
Thus, the savings are greatest for sites with numerous 3174s. Moreover, a
connection to older 3274s or other IBM SDLC equipment, such as its banking
systems, isn't available from IBM--it doesn't make a TIC for them.
    As part of the conversion process, the SDLC Link Server adds
modified addresses and other information needed to make the data look to a
host as if it were coming from a 3174 equipped with a TIC.
    The SDLC Link Server's approach is very similar to that used in the
SNACS product line from Sync Research (Tustin, Calif.). Both convert an
SDLC data stream and make the third-party controller look like a 3174
equipped with a TIC. Another entrant in the SNA connectivity field, Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.), takes a different tack with its SNA
routing capability. Cisco allows SDLC to communicate over a LAN
internetwork, just as Netlink and Sync Research do. But Cisco's devices
don't perform the conversions needed to make an SDLC device look like any
other device. They simply transport SDLC through a router-based LAN
internetwork. To the 3745 FEP, the connected SDLC device still looks like a
3174 linked over aWAN rather than a LAN-attached device.
    The SNA software that Netlink will sell to other third-party
vendors offers yet another twist on this theme. As with Cisco routers
equipped with SNA routing--software that Cisco has promised--routers using
the Netlink code will able to form a LAN internetwork that products like
Netlink's SDLC Server Link and Sync Research's SNACS can then use. At
present, only bridges (or routers operating as bridges) can be used to
build such networks.
    Netlink's SNA software also adds capabilities not available through
IBM communications controllers, such as routing of data from 3174 and 3274
controllers to multiple hosts. In comparison, a 3174 with a TIC can send
data to a maximum of two hosts.
    Routers equipped with Netlink's SNA software also offer advantages
when connecting to Logical Unit 6.2 devices. The routers will accept data
from LU 6.2 devices in the same way a 3174 would, but with one improvement:
The FEPs will not have to provide instructions to the router. Another plus
is that multiple 3174s or other Physical Unit 2.0 devices attached to an
SDLC Link Server or router will appear to FEPs as one device supporting
many terminals. This PU 2.0 ''concentration'' function will reduce the
administrative tasks involved in maintaining an SNA network.
    Netlink says its routing software will support IBM's Advanced
Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN) Network Node scheme if and when IBM
publishes its specifications. Netlink says it supports only those SNA
routing capabilities with published specifications.
    The router software also will support NetView and the simple
network management protocol (SNMP). Router vendors will integrate the
network management capabilities and all the routing functions performed by
Netlink's software into their products by making available certain
Netlink-defined ''hooks.'' The Netlink software, acting as an integrated
part of the routers, will use these hooks to collect information from the
router, such as its knowledge of all available paths through an
internetwork.
    Netlink's Internetwork Gateway connects DEC VT100 terminals to IBM
hosts across a LAN internetwork. It also provides a direct gateway to IBM
hosts for these devices.
    In a typical application, the Internetwork Gateway would attach on
one side to an Ethernet LAN with a DEC or third-party terminal server. To
the DEC terminal server, the Internetwork Gateway appears to be a DEC host.
But rather than provide access to the host, the Internetwork Gateway
converts the Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol used by the DEC terminals
to the 3270 protocol used by IBM 3270 terminals. Like the SDLC Link Server,
the Internetwork Gateway then takes incoming data--in this case, 3270 data
from VT100 terminals--and converts it to the LLC2 protocol for transmission
across the LAN internetwork to a remote IBM 3745 FEP,.
    As a result, DEC terminal users can run 3270 sessions on their
existing DEC terminals, eliminating the need for users to have two
terminals on their desks.
    IBM does not support DEC's LAT protocol. Many third-party terminal
servers available for use with DEC terminals do provide 3270 gateways, but
none provide the LLC2 support of the Internetwork Gateway.
    The Internetwork Gateway supports between 16 and 128 LAT and 3270
terminal sessions, divided among any number of physical terminals. As with
Netlink's router software, NetView and SNMP are supported. The Internetwork
Gateway also supports DEC's Terminal Server Manager network management
software.

PRODUCT POTPOURRI FOR IBM MIDRANGE SYSTEMS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Andrew Corp. has announced a spate of products for IBM midrange systems,
including an active wiring hub, enhanced file transfer software, and a
Windows graphical user interface for 5250 terminal emulation.
    The SuperStar/400C wiring hub uses coax cabling to connect
twinaxial devices to AS/400 and System/3X hosts or controllers, providing
the benefits of a star-wired network. The hub lets users upgrade their
networks while retaining their original cable investment.
    The hub receives, amplifies, retimes, and splits signals into seven
device channels. All connected devices operate concurrently yet
independently, because each port has its own transmit and receive drivers.
A dual-port model supports up to 14 workstations. The single-port version
costs $695; the dual-port, $1,395.
    Andrew's ETU file transfer software for IBM S/38 and AS/400
computers now features record and field selection, multidevice transfers,
host-batch transfer execution, and entry/exit programs. Tasks that used to
require two or three separate commands now can be accomplished in one, the
vendor says. ETU 5.0 costs $800 for the S/38 and $950 for the AS/400. Users
of earlier versions can upgrade for $149 (S/38) and $249 (AS/400).
    Andrew also introduced TwinView, a Windows 3.0 graphical user
interface for the 3XTwin and Multi-Twin members of its Emerald Series of
5250 emulators. With the new interface, users can link PCs under Windows
3.0 to S/3X or AS/400 machines. TwinView users can operate up to seven
sessions at once, moving around with a mouse and scroll bars. Other
features include Windows Clipboard support, for copying and pasting text,
and Windows font support, for choosing fixed-pitch display fonts and font
sizes. TwinView also is compatible with ETU 5.0. It costs $149.

MULTITASKING FILE TRANSFER

By:
Eric M. Hindin

The Systems Center Inc. has added OS/2 software to its Network DataMover
series of automated data transfer products. Called Network DataMover-PC for
OS/2 (NDM-PC for OS/2), the product allows IBM PS/2s and other
OS/2-compatible machines to communicate automatically with IBM mainframe
hosts running under the MVS, VM, or VSE operating systems.
    The software uses the Communications Manager component of OS/2
Version 1.3 Extended Edition to set up a synchronous data link control
(SDLC) or token ring connection between the PC and the host. To set up this
connection, the user must have an IBM Multi-Protocol SDLC Adapter or
Token-Ring Adapter installed in the PC.
    NDM-PC for OS/2 performs binary and test file transfers using data
compression.
    Like other programs that take advantage of OS/2's multitasking
capabilities, NPM-PC for OS/2 runs concurrently with Communications Manager
3270 sessions and any other OS/2 sessions on the same machine. NPM-PC for
OS/2 also features a menu-driven user interface. It costs $850.

RUMBA TIME

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Wall Data Inc. has added several products to its Rumba line of PC-to-host
connectivity software, including 3270 emulation for TCP/IP networks and IBM
AS/400 minicomputers and OS/2, French-, and German-language versions of its
flagship software.
    The Rumba TN3270 interface allows PC users on TCP/IP networks to
connect to IBM mainframes through the Microsoft Windows graphical user
interface. It works with mainframe-based TCP/IP Telnet servers to deliver
3270 terminal emulation to PC users. Users can access, use, and integrate
data simultaneously from multiple hosts. TN3270 features include support
for IBM Models 2 through 5 terminals, full mapping of 3270 function keys,
multiple sessions, mainframe graphics, and IND$FILE data transfer. The
interface is included with Rumba Version 3.1, which costs $495.
    The Rumba for 3270 feature is an option for users of Rumba for
AS/400. Users see the familiar Rumba interface, but now they can access
3270 mainframe information and integrate it into their AS/400 and PC
applications. With a few mouse clicks, users can cut and paste information
between 3270 sessions and Windows or AS/400 applications, quickly
assembling elements from disparate host sources. The option costs $200.
    Rumba PM 1.0 allows users of OS/2 with Presentation Manager to
access 3270 host applications. Previously, Rumba was available only under
Microsoft Windows. Rumba PM features include QuickStep, which automates
host access; Hotlinks, which brings in host data to OS/2 applications; and
Hotspots, which activates common host functions. Users also can customize
the keyboard and display colors. Rumba PM costs $495.
    Finally, for international and multinational users, the vendor has
released French- and German-language versions of its flagship product,
Rumba 3.1. Context-sensitive help is provided in both languages. The French
and German versions are available from Wall Data and its distributors in
France and Germany. The packages cost $495 each if purchased in the United
States.

RJE EMULATOR FOR OS/2 AND DOS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Network Software Associates Inc. has unveiled an 802.2 link driver for its
AdaptSNA RJE PC-to-host communications software package. This makes
AdaptSNA RJE the first RJE emulator for OS/2 PCs to support Logical Link
Control (LLC) environments, the vendor says.
    Remote job entry (RJE) is used by many companies for the efficient
transfer of large amounts of data. RJE under OS/2 is significant because
OS/2 Extended Edition, while providing 3270 and Advanced Program-to-Program
Communications (APPC) and Logical Unit (LU) 6.2 links, ignores RJE.
AdaptSNA RJE can be used for batch transfer applications in IBM Job Entry
Subsystem (JES), Power, or other Virtual Telecommunications Access Method
(VTAM) environments.
    AdaptSNA RJE ($785) is available for both OS/2 and DOS. OS/2 users
can initiate an RJE file transfer and run other applications
simultaneously. AdaptSNA RJE also can be used in unattended operations,
automatically loading when the workstation is turned on and simply waiting
until the host is ready to download.

CONFIGURE ROUTERS ON MULTIPLE SNMP SYSTEMS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Wellfleet Communications Inc. has introduced a Network Configuration
Utility (NCU) that allows users to configure networks of many Wellfleet
routers from a central workstation. The NCU software works with any simple
network management protocol (SNMP)-based management system running on a Sun
workstation, the vendor says.
    NCU offers a menu-driven interface for setting up new router nodes
and automatically constructs and maintains a Structured Query Language
(SQL) database of information on the network.
    Wellfleet says NCU is simple enough for novice operators to use.
Configuration changes to a network of routers are made from a Unix-based
windowing interface via pop-up menus that prompt the user to define a node
and bring it on-line. For example, to configure an IP router, Wellfleet
says, a user need only enter the IP address, subnet mask, and transmit
broadcast type; NCU automatically supplies the rest of the information
needed to get the router up and running. The product also comes with an
expert editor that allows more technically astute net managers to adjust
parameters and optimize network performance.
    NCU is the first product in Wellfleet's Advanced Internetwork
Management (AIM) program, under which the vendor plans to provide
applications for managing Wellfleet routers on a range of SNMP platform
systems. In the future, the vendor says, AIM value-added SNMP applications
will incorporate various SNMP management information bases (MIBs) for
managing Wellfleet equipment, such as the Remote Monitoring MIB, which
Wellfleet says will offer more comprehensive fault and performance
information than is possible with SNMP MIB II. NCU prices begin at $5,000,
including the SQL database.

NETWORK MONITORING BY PROXY

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Kalpana Inc. has added simple network management protocol (SNMP) support to
its EtherSwitch fast packet Ethernet switches. Network managers now can
remotely monitor and control multiple EtherSwitches from a single SNMP
station.
    EtherSwitch SNMP Proxy Agent combines an SNMP management
information base II (MIB II) agent and an MIB extension that works with
third-party SNMP management systems to generate alarms, collect statistics,
and perform diagnostics. The proxy agent can monitor the traffic load of

VAX SECURITY
TO THE MAX

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Demax Software Inc. has added three packages to its Distributed Security
Technology Series of software products that monitor, control, and analyze
user activity on Digital Equipment Corp. VAX/VMS systems. The Detective
family of products, acquired by Demax from Saber Software Corp., consists
of the Connection Detective, the System Detective, and Chalk Talk.
    The Connection Detective is packet-
monitoring software for VAX/VMS hosts that tracks incoming traffic. It
recognizes more than 100 protocols, including DECnet, TCP/IP, OSI, Apple
Computer Inc.'s AppleTalk, and Novell Inc.'s Internet/Sequenced Packet
Exchange (IPX/SPX).
    The System Detective monitors host activity. It consists of two
modules. The Automated Operations Module (System Detective-A/O) monitors
and records user calls to the host and restricts user access. The
Interactive Session Module (System Detective-I/S) tracks specific host
sessions by user name, process, terminal type, privilege level, priority,
and group membership.
    Chalk Talk is a help-desk version of the System Detective-I/S that
gives network administrators access to users' screens from VAX terminals.
Staff members can employ Chalk Talk to watch what users are typing on their
terminals and correct their syntax or look at their error messages.
    The Connection Detective costs $1,200 to $9,600. The System
Detective-A/O costs from $1,300 to $8,000. The System Detective-I/S costs
from $2,000 to $12,000. Chalk Talk costs from $1,050 to $6,000.

STRONG-ARMING SECURITY BREACHES

By:
Eric M. Hindin

SunSoft has added two packages to its SunShield line of security products:
Account Resource Management (ARM) and Automated Security Enhanced Tool
(ASET). The packages let users customize security for Unix networks.
    With ARM, administrators can specify parameters for functions such
as password length and the number of attempts permitted for gaining access
to a network. They can limit log-on attempts for all or part of the
network, as well as individual systems. ARM also lets network managers
restrict access hours, lock screens, and set automatic expiration limits on
passwords and user accounts.
    ASET lets administrators adjust security levels, automatically
modifying the system to the desired levels. With ASET, network managers can
build a ''fire wall'' between a company's internal network and external
networks.
    ARM and ASET together cost $295 for a single license and $4,500 for
a site license. Additional documentation costs $100 per copy.

'FRAME SERVER' DISHES UP MORE FRAME RELAY FLAVORS
Timeplex's device comes in add-in and standalone versions and offers a
choice of connection types

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Plenty of mux vendors have caught the frame relay bug, but only Timeplex
Inc. offers an interface both as an enhancement to existing muxes and as a
standalone unit. That gives users of the vendor's Link/FrameServer more
choices for connecting FDDI, token ring, and Ethernet LANs--including the
ability to pass SNA traffic across a frame relay link.
    Frame relay is becoming a popular choice for LAN interconnect
because of its low overhead and high data rates (up to 1.544 Mbit/s at
present). By adding a card to Timeplex's Link/2+ multiplexer, network
managers can squeeze more traffic onto available bandwidth.
    Because the frame server also is available in standalone form, a
typical configuration might include sites both with and without Link/2+
muxes (see figure). Sites with muxes most likely will use them to transport
a mix of voice and data, while those without probably will use bridges or
routers to transport LAN data, says James Babcock, Timeplex's vice
president for product management.
    At those sites with a mux, the frame server would permit LAN data
to be carried across the backbone in frame relay form, along with
circuit-switched voice. Regardless of the presence or absence of a mux,
LANs connect to the frame server either directly or through a router.
    The frame relay network can be either a private network (i.e., a
mux-based backbone) or a public frame relay service. To transport data over
the wide area, the frame server encapsulates each data packet in a link
access procedure-D (LAPD) frame, adding a flag and data link circuit
identifier (DLCI) with addressing information at the beginning of each
frame and a frame check sequence at the end. The frame server then filters
the frames based on their DLCIs and sends them to the appropriate wide-area
connections.
    Network managers can transport SNA traffic across frame relay nets
thanks to the frame server's encapsulation of high-level/synchronous data
link control (HDLC/SDLC) frames. The encapsulated SDLC or HDLC frames are
sent across the network in either point-to-point or multipoint mode using
idle suppression (a process that prevents idle SDLC frames from being sent
across the network) for improved bandwidth utilization.
    Timeplex's encapsulation approach differs from that proposed by
many router vendors, according to Jim Harrison, program director for global
network strategies at the Meta Group Inc. (Westport, Conn.), a market
research firm. Harrison says router makers may add SDLC-over-frame
relay support by encapsulating SDLC frames twice--first within TCP/IP
packets, and second within LAP-D frames.
    There are two advantages to dual encapsulation, Harrison says.
First, it allows SDLC packets to be carried not only across the wide area
but also across LAN backbones at remote sites. Second, network managers
have better control over the integrity and routing of SDLC data if it's
encapsulated within a higher-level protocol like TCP/IP.
    However, dual encapsulation is more complex, and in Harrison's view
it's ultimately a stopgap measure. Most industry observers believe frame
relay eventually will include specs for higher-level protocols that would
ensure end-to-end data integrity.
    In addition to SDLC, the frame server also can handle traffic from
Ethernet, token ring, and fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) LANs. The
combination of LANs and WANs it connects to, and how it connects to them,
depends on choice of configuration.
    The unit features a high-speed (550-Mbit/s) bus with a control
board and three slots for add-in cards that supply various connections.
These links can include four T1/E1 lines, up to four Ethernets, two token
rings, and one dual-attached FDDI connection. Any combination of cards can
be installed in the frame server; for example, network managers can choose
to install wide-area cards in all three of the device's slots for a total
of 12 WAN connections. LANs also can connect, via routers, across a T1 link
to the frame server.
    The frame server's modular design means network managers can employ
it in a variety of settings, ranging from switching to routing. In the
12-port WAN configuration, for instance, the frame server acts as a frame
relay switch, accepting frames at a port, filtering them based on the
DLCIs, and forwarding them out one of the other ports. If the unit is
stocked solely with LAN cards, it acts as a multiprotocol router for
TCP/IP, Xerox Network Services (XNS), and Internet Packet Exchange (IPX)
traffic. In this case, LAN data packets are routed based on their TCP/IP,
XNS, or IPX addresses.
    But these two configurations--pure switch and pure router--are
unlikely to be widely employed; users more likely will want some
combination of routing and frame switching. Timeplex's Babcock says
several companies have asked to use the product on a trial basis when it
becomes available for beta testing early next year. One user wants to
install frame server cards in its Link/2+ multiplexers to add support for
frame relay to its time-division multiplexing (TDM) backbone. That company
now uses the backbone for voice and video and wants to add LAN traffic.
Another company has a router-based network to which it wants to add a
frame relay backbone.
    Most multiplexer vendors have been developing some form of frame
relay packet switch for their TDM multiplexers. Timeplex's scheme of
dividing the backbone between packet and circuit data (when the frame
server is installed inside the Link/2+ mux rather than as a standalone unit
connected to a pure frame relay backbone) is a relatively common method
called ''packet over circuit.''
    The essential feature in packet-over-circuit techniques is that the
mux-and-frame server combination uses separate components to process
packets and frames. There are other approaches to combining frame and
circuit technology; StrataCom, for example, creates virtual circuits over a
packet-switched architecture.
    Meta Group's Harrison describes the Timeplex approach as similar to
that of Network Equipment Technologies Inc. (Redwood City, Calif.) and
Newbridge Networks Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.). ''It's the right move for
Timeplex,'' he says of the frame server. He believes, however, the product
will appeal mostly to network managers who are already Timeplex customers.

ECHO CANCELER ALSO MONITORS PERFORMANCE

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Micro Integrated Communications Corp. says its EC1000 is the first digital
echo canceler that monitors circuit performance. The device, which can be
used by common carriers and managers of private T1 networks, enables users
to control both functions from a single built-in keypad. The EC1000
monitors performance of extended superframe (ESF) format traffic, according
to the vendor.
    Each EC1000 can monitor up to 16 T1 circuits. Operators are alerted
to circuit problems via audible alarms and warning lights that flash on the
unit's liquid crystal display. To cancel line echo, the unit has a residual
echo control that replaces any echo encountered with matched background
noise. The EC1000 also has a dual power supply configured for load sharing.
If one supply fails, the other can maintain adequate power for the unit,
the vendor says. The EC1000 costs $100 per channel.

MODEM BOOSTS ERROR CORRECTION

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Microcom Inc.'s QX/4232bis high-speed modem complies with the company's
Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) Class 10 standard to provide virtually
error-free PC communications on dial-up or leased lines, the vendor claims.
The modem also provides CCITT V.32bis transmission at up to 14.4 kbit/s and
effective throughput rates of up to 38.4 kbit/s using V.42bis data
compression, the vendor says.
    MNP 10 maintains data integrity by decreasing transmission rates
when line quality degrades. When interference decreases, the modem
increases transmission speed to its maximum throughput.
    Other features that improve transmission speed include changing
packet sizes to compensate for varying interference levels and beginning
link setup at the most stable line speed. The QX/4232bis costs $999.

FROM OLD MODEMS TO NEW

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Release 3.0 of Octocom Systems Inc.'s 8X96 line of 14.4-kbit/s modems can
automatically answer either full- or half-duplex calls. The use of a
half-duplex autodetect mode allows users to phase in the faster devices as
they upgrade from older modems, such as half-duplex 4.8-kbit/s modems. For
instance, modems at central sites can be replaced first, and those at
remote locations can be phased in over a period of time.
    The 8X96 modem works with dial-up or leased lines and connects to a
wide variety of front-end processors, according to the vendor. The modems
support all Bell and CCITT modem standards, including the V.42bis standard
for data compression. In addition, the modems are fully compatible with
Octocom's network management system. Prices for the 8X96 line start at
$1,195.

REMOTE USERS GET LAN ACCESS

By:
Johna Till Johnson

A V.42bis modem from Microtest Inc. comes complete with built-in support
for Novell Inc.'s Internet Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol, giving remote
users direct access to Novell LANs without requiring remote control
software.
    Called LANModem, the 9.6-kbit/s device acts as a peripheral on the LAN
and lets users log in from a remote location and run network applications
as if they were locally attached, the vendor claims. The company's
LANModem-based FastLink software allows file transfer, printing, and
remote control of networked PCs.
    LANModem's second serial port lets more than one user
simultaneously dial in or out of the network, and a second LANModem at the
remote location permits linking via phone lines. The unit also includes
security features, audit trails, setup utilities, and the capability to
perform automatic field upgrades. LANModem works on thick and thin Ethernet

MAKE WAY FOR THE CAR MODEM

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Outback, a cellular modem from Eagle Cross Inc., can transmit data at more
than 10 kbit/s over some cellular connections, according to the vendor. The
unit, which weighs about 9 pounds, comprises a Telebit Corp. T2500 modem, a
Motorola Inc. 3-watt cellular transceiver and handset, Magicsoft
communications software, a built-in antenna, and an interface board from
Eagle Cross. Power can be provided by a.c. or d.c. lines or by BatPak, a
4.4-amp battery pack that can operate up to 2.5 hours in transmission mode.
The modem connects to a laptop or desktop PC via an EIA-232 serial port.
    Although the Outback can connect to conventional dial-up modems,
data rates with such modems generally are limited to 0.3 or 1.2 kbit/s via
cellular links, according to the vendor. With Outback modems at either end
of a cellular link, data speeds of 16,800 bit/s can be achieved with data
compression, Eagle Cross says. The Outback costs $3,495; BatPak costs $200,
and a carrying case lists for $95.

LinkStar Offers
Integrated Service

LinkStar Communications Corp. (662 S. Military Trail, Deerfield
Beach, FL 33442) has introduced LinkStar directory, an integrated
solution for finding, publishing and promoting businesses and
people on the Internet. The directory allows anyone to have an
instant, free, entry-level presence on the World Wide Web that is
accessible and searchable by any other World Wide Web user.

LinkStar Communications has signed several well-known companies as
charter advertisers, including c 5/8net, Digital Consulting Inc.,
and Success Magazine Conferences. LinkStar is also beginning an
aggressive Partners Program to recruit Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) and Internet Presence Providers (IPPs) to share in
advertising revenue generated from an innovative new technology
developed by LinkStar. The company claims that "LinkStar is
designed to publish your presence on the Web, promote that
presence, and allow you to search for people, organizations and Web
sites with pinpoint accuracy."

The heart of the LinkStar Directory is its free electronic business
card (e-Card) system. Any Internet user with an email address can
easily fill out an e-Card that is accessible and searchable by any
other World Wide Web user. The e-Card includes standard business
card information, as well as a variety of options which allow users
to describe their companies' products and services, and index their
description in a wide range of categories. In addition, the e-Card
provides an automatic hot link to the entrant's email address
and/or World Wide Web home page.

The LinkStar directory includes search capabilities allowing users
to locate listings based on a range of criteria. Searches can be
executed for names, companies, cities, countries, states,
provinces, postal codes, subject categories, key words, or
combinations of these criteria, by direct input into an entry
screen, without the need for Boolean logic entries. Search results
return in order of a proprietary match rating index, display the e-
Card as entered, and link the searcher directly to the information
provider's email and Web locations.

LinkStar users can have their search results sent to them by email
so that they can create their own targeted mailing lists, and
listed organizations will receive monthly statistics via email on
how many times their e-Cards have been viewed by LinkStar users. To
prevent tampering, LinkStar Communications provides each
organization listed in their directory with a security password to
control editing of their listings.

LinkStar claims that their directory is receiving more than 100,000
hits per day and its stock of e-Cards and Web pages have grown to
more than 20,000 since an unpublicized beta version was put on the
Internet last October.

For more information, contact Kevin Rudden or Derek Lane (Tel:
508/369-2100, email: 3566721@mcimail.com), visit the company's home
page at http://www.linkstar.com or send a request to:

Free Site for
Senior Surfers

Millions of seniors already surfing the Internet now have free
access to Grand Times (El Cerrito, CA), a magazine edited for
adults aged 55+. The magazine was launched in its print edition
format in November 1992 and is distributed to older adults in the
San Francisco Bay Area. Reece Halpern, publisher and owner,
recognized that "it is a complete myth that seniors do not use the
information highway or that they are afraid of technology," and
decided to launch the first weekly online magazine for active older
adults.

According to Halpern, a recent survey conducted by Secure Horizons
of 1,750 seniors aged 64+ revealed that 24% of all seniors now use
personal computers at home. Another survey found that approximately
four million seniors use the Internet on a regular basis. Microsoft
reports that 16% of all people who have used a computer are
retirees.

To ensure immediate exposure, Grand Times will have live links with
several online groups including SeniorCom (a senior network
averaging 70,000 visits per month from computer users aged 55-75)
and SeniorNet (a 17,000-member organization of computer-using
seniors).

Publishing Inc. (Tel: 510/527-4337, email: mags@grandtimes.com, or

Ads Delivered
In Real Time

c/net: the computer network (150 Chestnut St., San Francisco, CA
94111) has unveiled new technology that allows advertisers to
deliver custom ad messages to different customers in real-time
based on specific demographic information. The new technology,
called DREAM (Delivery of Real-Time Electronic Advertising
messages) was made available to c/net's advertisers beginning
December 15 on c/net's two World Wide Web sites: c/net online
(http://www.cnet.com) and shareware.com (http://www.shareware.com).
Three direct marketing advertisers, Insight, Internet Shopping
Network, and MicroXperts are the first to utilize the new
technology.

Developed by c/net's technology group, c/net's DREAM software gives
c/net advertisers the opportunity to filter choices for banner ad
delivery based on specific demographic information, such as:
    age
    gender
    zip code
    system platform (Macintosh, PC, Unix, etc.)
    connection speed (14.4 modem, 28.8 modem, ISDN line, etc.)
    browser type (Netscape, Mosaic, NetCruiser, etc.)
    affiliation (AOL, Prodigy, CompuServe, Netcom, etc.)
    domain (EDU, GOV, COM, etc.)
    CD-ROM drive owner or not
    connect from home or office

The program allows advertisers to determine who sees a particular
banner advertisement and who doesn't. For example, a direct
marketing firm such as Internet Shopping Network or Insight, can
deliver one banner to Macintosh users and another banner to PC
users. Similarly, a modem manufacturer can send messages to people
connecting from a slower modem, suggesting they upgrade to a faster
modem. Or a CD-ROM distributor with many different titles could
target only people with CD-ROM drives and, then, further narrow
their target to men or women depending on the title.

Since October of last year, c/net also has offered ARM (Advertising
Response and Monitoring) software, a set of tools that allows
advertisers to evaluate audience response to their messages. Using
ARM, c/net online, advertisers can determine the audience most
responsive to a product or message and compare advertising usage
and response rates against system-wide averages. This technology
has helped c/net to attract more paying advertisers than almost any
site on the Internet, including Microsoft, Intel, IBM, MCI,
Hewlett-Packard and others.

c/net's advertising rates are based solely on actual impressions or
CADs (Confirmed Ads Delivered), with all advertising banners
rotated dynamically through the service. Through c/net's unique
dynamic ad delivery system, advertising is more seamlessly
integrated into the site. Only one advertising banner appears per
page, and always in the premium position--at the top of the page.

For more information, contact: Patrick Toland (Tel: 415/395-7800,
ext. 535, email: patrickt@cnet.com).

Internet Marketing
Excellence Awards

The 1995 Tenagra Awards for Internet Marketing Excellence were
awarded to Federal Express, Ragu, Yahoo!, NetPOST, Software.Net,
and Virtual Vineyards.

According to Cliff Kurtzman, president of The Tenagra Corp. (1100
Hercules, Suite 120, Houston, TX 77058), "these awards provide peer
recognition to significant Internet marketing successes over the
past year. Each success makes our industry more credible in the
public's eye, and recognition of these successes strengthens the
industry." Award nominations are made by an international panel of
Internet marketing experts and final awardees are selected by
Tenagra.

    Federal Express (http://www.fedex.com/) was selected for their
online information center that provides immediate tracking of
package status.

    Ragu Spaghetti Sauce (http://www.eat.com/) was selected due to
their online marketing and brand awareness campaign that is both
fun and entertaining while allowing them to gather customer
opinions and collect valuable information about market trends.

    Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com/) has facilitated Internet
marketing by making it possible for users to easily find online
resources.

    As the first Media Relations firm on the Net, Eric Ward and
his NetPOST service (http://www.netpost.com/) pioneered the concept
of a company specifically devoted to Internet online and media
awareness campaigns.

    By driving costs down and sharing the savings with customers,
"Software.Net" (http://www.software.net/), a service of CyberSource
Corp., is a true global business success that could only have
happened on the Internet, electronically shipping over 5,000 pieces
of software weekly to customers worldwide.

    Virtual Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/) has built a
profitable business selling wines and gourmet foods online.
Focusing on small producers, they have demonstrated the potential
of the Net to take limited-distribution products to a worldwide
market.

Thomas Online
Corporate Purchasing

Thomas Publishing Co.'s Electronic Purchasing Information Corp.
(EPIC, One Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10001) has introduced an
electronic corporate purchasing network for industrial products.
Called CONNECTSUS, it is targeted to provide timely information on
a potential universe of over one million Maintenance, Repair and
Operations (MRO) products, reducing purchasing time from weeks to
hours and cutting transaction costs by 90%.

The service is made possible by EPIC's new alliance with GE
Information Services (P.O. Box 6403, Rockville, MD 20849-6403).
Companies using CONNECTSUS not only have a large number of products
to choose from, but they can also compare product features and
prices at a glance. Using CONNECTSUS' Windows-based software,
buyers have the ability to research and compare products, negotiate
prices, and, through the alliance with GE, enter orders and make
purchases online with a purchasing card number via the system's
link to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards.

Buyers using CONNECTSUS are assured of privacy, ease of use, and
greater control over the purchasing of industrial supplies, a
market which accounts for $400 billion in expenditures annually.
The high margin of error and costs associated with the traditional
order process, as much as $150 per purchase, are dramatically
reduced.

Suppliers using CONNECTSUS have the opportunity to show to their
target markets a wider number of products, with a capability of
50,000 product classifications to date, in greater detail than ever
before. CONNECTSUS' reach to corporate purchasers is wider than
available through print catalogues or even CD ROMs. CONNECTSUS
allows suppliers to continually add to their listings, and to
update that information more cost effectively than available
elsewhere.

For more information, contact: Lynthia Romney or John Johmann of
Padilla Spear Beardsley (Tel: 212/752-8338) for Thomas Publishing
Co.

Excessive Fees Block
I'Way Construction

Teleport Communications Group (TCG, New York, NY) has released its
latest "Info Bit" dealing with the roadblocks facing local
telephone competition. This information addresses a key issue now
under discussion by the conference committee working on federal
telecommunications legislation.

Competitive access providers and competitive local exchange
carriers are helping to pave the "Information Superhighway" with
optical fiber. To install such telecommunications infrastructure,
new entrants need access to public 'rights of way'. But, the report
finds, "excessive franchise fees imposed by municipalities retard
infrastructure investment."

Both federal and state courts have supported the principle that
municipalities may not use their police powers over the public
rights of way to generate excess revenue. TCG states that "not only
are excessive franchise fees often illegal, they are always
anticonsumer." Since incumbent providers typically pay nothing for
the privilege of constructing in, under, or over the public rights
of way, a franchise fee charged only to new telecommunications
providers is a barrier to entry. It deprives consumers of state-of-
the-art infrastructure and new telecommunications services at
reasonable prices.

Thus, the report calls for "municipalities charging franchise fees
should do so on a nondiscriminatory basis. All local exchange
carriers, including the incumbent, should be subject to those fees,
which should recover only the actual cost of providing access to
public rights of way. Other states and the U.S. Congress should
follow the lead of Connecticut, Florida and Texas which recently
legislated nondiscriminatory access to public rights of way."

For more information, contact TCG, Gail Schwartz (Tel: 718/355-
2892).

1996 Slowdown in
Electronic Marketplace

International Data Corp. (IDC, Five Speen St., Framingham, MA
01701) has predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment as
investors and corporations suffer through the discouragingly slow
development of a significant consumer base. By the end of the year,
IDC predicts 20% of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial
Web sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost
sites. The leading online information service providers will derive
more than one-half of their revenue from providing access to the
Web by mid-1997.

IDC predicts that "In 1996 ... the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's 'intoxication' stage to a
'hangover' stage. The high-flying Internet suppliers will have
disappointing financial results, while technical capabilities of
the Internet are stretched to the breaking point." Although IDC
predicts the overall growth in online subscribers will continue to
be very strong, they expect 1996 to show a high turnover rate as
users disappointed by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscriptions.

But, they also predict that during the next five years, the number
of online users will rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it
will exceed 1 billion. Industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate spending
will rise from 2 to 2.5% of revenues to more than 5%. In addition,
IDC believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more
by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

A full copy of IDC's 1996 predictions can be found on IDC's home
page. The address is http://www.idcresearch.com. Interested parties
are welcome to share views and insights with Frank Gens, senior VP
of research at IDC, via email at fgens@idcresearch.com. For more
information, contact Hillary DeMello (Tel: 508/935-4282, email:

AT&T Changes
Online Strategy

AT&T Corp. (550 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022) has signaled an
important strategic change in its computer online services,
planning to abandon the proprietary software required to use its
online services: the Imagination Network, PersonalLink, and
Interchange. Instead, AT&T will reshape its online services around
the technical standards of the Internet, giving them Web-like
hypertext links. The company stated that "the Interchange platform
as we know it will phase out over a year or so, to be dissolved
into the World Wide Web." AT&T bought Interchange from Ziff Davis
in December 1994 for a widely-reported but unconfirmed $50 million.


AT&T said it would be able to take advantage of the best electronic
commerce and navigation software for the Internet, most of which
are not compatible with Interchange. In doing so, AT&T is following
the lead of Microsoft, which in December changed tack to open its
online service for free to Internet users. Most of AT&T's
publishing partners already have their own Web sites. Some analysts
questioned whether they would need AT&T at all in that case.

At the moment, subscribers to AT&T Business Network pay $24.95 a
month for up to 10 hours of use. With this they get free
Interchange software and a Netscape Web browser. AT&T has not
decided if or how it will charge for the service when it is web-
based.

More information on AT&T's new policy can be found at the company's
home page: http://www.att.com/press.

TeacherSoft Inc. (TeacherSoft, Inc., 903 East 18th Street, Suite
230, Plano, TX 75074) has announced the worldwide availability of
InterGO, termed "the industry's first enriched Internet software."
This new multimedia product combines browsing, searching, email,
file transfer, Telnet, news and extensive reference content, virus
scanning, and screening for objectionable material through a fully
integrated series of familiar scenes.

InterGO's interface uses scenes including an office, library, news
room and treasure map to provide graphic options for users as they
access the Internet. InterGO's library is equipped with The
Columbia Encyclopedia, Fifth Edition; The American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition; Roget's
Thesaurus; a world factbook and atlas; an Internet guide; and
hundreds of literary works which are hyperlinked to the
encyclopedia. Key words within articles in the encyclopedia are
hyperlinked to relevant information sources on the Internet.

The company claims that "TeacherSoft's exclusive search technology
allows InterGO users to retrieve information from Internet sites
instantly on virtually any subject. TeacherSoft has replaced the
bookmark of traditional Internet browsers with a graphically-rich
library, enabling users to create bookcases filled with virtual
books of information." InterGO also simplifies the process of
obtaining an Internet account. During the easy installation
process, InterGO searches for an Internet connection on the user's
computer. If an online service provider is not located, InterGO
lists Internet providers and assists the user in setting up an
account.

In addition to making the Internet easier to use, InterGO
incorporates TeacherSoft's exclusive KinderGuard security screen
and the SafeSurf rating system. These features allow a parent or
administrator to set parameters defining the types of materials
which will be accessible to children or employees. KinderGuard
screens material from Web and gopher sites, ftp archives, news
groups, and even mailing lists. When used in the home, the
screening mechanism enables parents to prevent children from
accessing inappropriate material. In the office, the screening
device can be used to prevent employees from accessing
objectionable sites via a corporate Internet account.

InterGO for Windows 95 is available from most major retailers and
computer catalogers. Suggested retail pricing of the complete
program, including the hyperlinked reference material, is $99.00.
A Windows 3.1 version and a Macintosh version will be available
early this year. For more information, see the company's home page
at http://www.teachersoft.com, call Tel: 214/424-7882 or Fax:
214/424-5503. A free trial version can be downloaded at

First Web-based
Workflow Program

Action Technologies Inc. (1301 Marina Village Pkwy., Suite 100,
Alameda, CA 94501-1028) has announced Action Workflow Metro, the
first workflow solution available for the Internet. Metro brings
the functionality of Action's workflow technology to the Web,
allowing companies to use the Internet to coordinate enterprise
business processes through any standard Web browser product,
including Netscape.

Metro provides customers with workflow functionality, enabling them
to reap business benefits from their Internet investment, including

Lotus Changes
Notes to Fit the 'Net

Lotus Development Corp. (55 Cambridge Pkwy., Cambridge, MA 02142),
responding to competitive pressure caused by new Internet
technology, has demonstrated major changes to its hallmark Notes
program that allow it to both read and create information for the
World Wide Web.

Most of the changes are included in a new version of Notes that
went on sale on January 1, 1996. This includes the possibility to
click onto the Web while reading email sent by a colleague in
Notes, or create Web pages using Notes. The steps are designed to
keep Lotus as the leading seller of messaging and groupware
programs, which combine electronic mail and sophisticated
databases.

Lotus has been increasingly threatened by technical standards
related to the Web that allow documents to be linked easily
regardless of the computers involved, something that Notes first
made popular. Those technical standards occur in Web programs, such
as browsers, that are less expensive than Notes.

Thousands of companies are incorporating Web standards in
communications programs not just for the Internet but on their
internal computer networks, something that's become known as an
"intranet." The new products put Lotus at the forefront of major
software producers who are changing their goods to embrace the
global data network. Pricing for Notes server software starts at
$495.

More information can be found at Lotus web site
(http://www.lotus.com).

Internet Watchdog
Monitors Users

Charles River Media (P.O. Box 417, 403 VFW Dr., Rockland, MA 02370)
has announced Internet WatchDog for PC and Macintosh computers, a
monitoring tool for the Internet and personal computers. Internet
WatchDog does not censor what is being displayed; rather it makes
a record for later viewing by authorized individuals.

Using this utility on any PC or Macintosh, parents, teachers and
employers will be able to view the activities taking place on their
computers without arbitrarily limiting access to the Internet or
creating a false sense of security by simply "blocking" certain
sites or keywords. As new sites are added to the Internet everyday,
it is impossible to "block" unsuitable Internet activity. Internet
WatchDog allows the user to monitor computer use, much like a
telephone bill enables the caller to see a listing of phone
numbers.

Internet WatchDog functions by capturing screen and other
information "intelligently" while the computer is running. The user
will be able to review a grid-like screen with a series of
thumbnail screen captures. For a closer look, any screen capture
can be seen full-size. In addition, Internet WatchDog records usage
of all software applications whether Internet related or other
computer activity. A password is required to access the monitoring
capabilities of the program, and any attempt to circumvent or
tamper with the Internet WatchDog is also recorded.

Internet WatchDog, priced at $29.95, is available from computer
software stores, bookstores, mail order catalogs, and Charles River
Media, Order Desk (Tel: 800/382-8505, email: chrivmedia@aol.com).

'Super Spider'
for the Web

Digital Equipment Corp. (111 Powdermill Rd., Maynard, MA 01754) has
introduced the Internet's first "super spider" software for the
World Wide Web. It conducts a comprehensive search of the entire
Web text at speeds up to 100 times faster than spiders used in
conventional information search services. The technology promises
to surpass the limitations of current information services by
delivering the most complete, precise, and up-to-date information
of the Web's entire text. The technology's super spider and super
indexer employ next-generation software and advanced networking,
powered by the highest-performing 64-bit Alpha computers.

The super spider creates and dispatches a "brood of spiders" that
crawls the entire Web. Second-generation scalable software
simultaneously locates and indexes text as it finds Web pages. A
search engine enables Web users to conduct precise searches for
specific information by looking for phrases, specifying key words,
using case-sensitive matches, and restricting searches to titles or
other parts of a document. Network connectivity is provided through
Digital's fiber optic and high-speed network switching
technologies. Ultra-high-speed search and indexing is enabled by
Digital's 64-bit servers.

Digital made the "beta" version of this technology available on
December 15, 1995. Users can test the super spider's Web index and
provide feedback through Digital's Internet address at:
http://www.altavista.digital.com. For more information, contact: Ed
Canty (Tel: 508/264-6672), Sarah Miller (Tel: 508/264-6673), Tom
Madden (Tel: 508/264-6675), or Don Bradley (Tel: 508/264-6678).

Connect Schools
to Internet Now

The Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure, a
panel appointed by president Clinton has recommended that
communities should push schools and libraries onto the information
superhighway by the year 2000. Connecting each public school to the
Internet by the year 2000 would cost 1.5% to 2% of schools'
budgets, or about $11 billion, the report estimated. That assumes
putting about 25 computers per school into a special classroom, or
lab, where a school's teachers can bring classes once a day.

But schools often remain leery of making big computer purchases,
worried they will buy the wrong thing or spend thousands on quickly
obsolete equipment, the panel noted. Poorer school districts and
those in rural areas face special problems. Often, schools must do
extensive renovations simply to get modern phone lines into
buildings constructed 50-70 years ago.

The panel found success stories others can follow:

    In Chester Ridge School District in Fishertown, PA, teachers
each year seek corporate grants that provide free Internet access,
then use the time to train colleagues and help students.
    A radio station in Lansing, MI, formed a partnership with
seven schools to help students email questions about current events
to the news staff, the White House, the governor and people around
the world.
    At Rosa Parks Interparish Elementary in Baltimore, MD, a
corporate grant helped students talk via computer with the school's
namesake, the legendary civil rights activist.
    In Taos, NM, students and adults use a university's computers
to look for jobs, visit a virtual library, get health information
or send email to lawmakers. The town, the state, local businesses
and corporations help pay.

The report found that parents with technical knowledge often are a
school's best resource. But it encouraged schools to seek help
anywhere: from corporations, state agencies, colleges or even by
switching money in their own budgets. About 1.3% of public schools'
spending is now devoted to technology, the study found.

Plug And Play
Security Solution

Digital Secured Networks (DSN) Technology Inc. (New York, NY) has
previewed its Net G-1 security device, a hardware unit that
provides an economical plug-and-play solution for absolutely secure
data transmission over the Internet and other internal and external
networks. Incorporating DSN's patent-pending "Electronic Privacy
Switch" technology, the Net G-1 offers transparent security,
authentication and encryption for network users.

The company claims that "Net G-1 is part of a bold new core
technology which greatly enhances the level of security for users
of the Internet, LANs and WANs, and will eventually be included in
other telecommunication applications."  The product is not a
firewall but can complement, support or replace a firewall or other
security software solutions.

The Net G-1, which resembles a small black-cased desktop computer,
provides a distributed security mode that cannot be entered or
decoded. With Net G-1, encryption does not take place over network
lines. So hackers, intruders or unauthorized personnel cannot
intercept, log onto, subvert or decode messages.

The Net G-1 is a completely plug-and-play device. The user plugs in
three cables and requires no further maintenance or support. Once
connected, the unit self-configures to PC or server's IP and
Ethernet address. It then automatically uses sophisticated
handshake mechanisms and authentication procedures and generates
unique public key encryption. These are combined with the private
keys on the receiving Net G-1 unit and establish a common secret
key connection between each pair of nodes.

Pricing for the Net G-1 will be "around $5,000.00 per unit" and
units will be available for sale in the first quarter 1996. DSN
officials are offering free evaluation/testing units to those
interested.

Associates (Tel: 212/366-5060, Fax: 212/366-5922).

Microsoft Proposes
I'Net Digital Signature

Microsoft Corp. (One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399) has
proposed an Internet digital signature initiative to provide a
safer environment for executable code on the Internet. To address
concerns about potentially malicious code or viruses, this
technology will enable users to verify that a program's integrity
is free of third-party tampering. Browsers will be equipped with
the ability to automatically download applications from a list of
vendors approved by the user. If the author is not on the user's
pre-approved list, the browser can display the signature of the
executable code and allow users to make an informed decision on
whether to proceed with the download.

Microsoft plans to propose the Internet digital signature
specifications to the W3 Consortium (W3C) and the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an open Internet standard. The
technology will be an open, proposed specification available to the
entire Internet community. In addition, as part of the Open Process
Design Review, Microsoft will host a digital signature design
preview to solicit feedback from the Internet community.

For more information, contact: Kira Sorensen (Tel: 206/882-8080) or

Medicine Cruises
Info Autostrada

Remote-controlled surgery, dietary advice and prescriptions for
yoga or antibiotics should soon be coming down the information
autostrada to a place near you, experts have predicted at a
telemedicine conference in Adelaide, Australia.

Futurist Dr. Peter Ellyard said communications technology offered
a great new chance for people to control their own health and well
being. People would be able to enter their own health profile into
personal computers and receive information to help them tailor
their own personal diet, exercise, stress control and health
programs and diagnose and manage some illnesses at home.

Dr. Ellyard said telemedicine should teach people about yoga,
shiatsu, traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine and other
complementary medicine as well as conventional treatments so people
could focus on creating health instead of ignoring their bodies
until they got sick.

Australia has a long tradition of telemedicine from the first Royal
Flying Doctor Service pedal radios brought to remote settlements in
1927 to a 1961 emergency operation in Antarctica directed through
telegrams by a brain specialist in Melbourne, to today's
telepsychiatry. And experts at the South Australian Health
Commission and Northern Territory Health Services conference say a
revolution is on the way, with Australia aiming to be at the
forefront of Asian telemedicine.

Design Your Own
Home Page on the 'Net

Recently, more and more services are being offered on the net for
individuals as well as businesses to design their own home page,
requiring a minimum of technical expertise as well as little or no
cost. Below is a sampling:

Home Page Wizard. CompuServe Inc. (500 Arlington Centre Blvd.,
Columbus, OH 43220) is expanding access to its Web page creation
and publishing tools, now also being available for businesses.

The "Home Page Wizard" can be used to build a page of up to one
megabyte and place it in CompuServe's Our World area
(http://www.ourworld.com). The Home Page Wizard and "Publishing
Wizard" are currently available for free to CompuServe members (GO
HPWIZ). While CompuServe is developing more advanced features to
create a specialized business-oriented service, businesses are
invited to start now in Our World and upgrade to the more advanced
corporate service when it becomes available. CompuServe said that
to date, more than 17,000 personal home pages have been posted in
the Our World area by CompuServe members. The Home Page Wizard
software package was downloaded from the CompuServe Information
Service over 35,000 times in the first ten days of availability.
For more information, contact Jeff Shafer of CompuServe, Tel:
614/538-4632 or visit CompuServe's home page at
http://www.compuserve.com.

Instant Home Page. Web Communications (Santa Cruz, CA) is offering
an online service that allows anyone to instantly create a World
Wide Web site simply by filling out forms in their Web browser. The
"WebCom Instant Site Service" offers reference and overview
information and five individual page creation forms. The overview
takes clients through a step-by-step process of creating pages,
where they can select the pages they wish to create, and enter
information into the automated form. They are then presented with
forms for five standard Web pages, including a home page, feedback
form, sign guestbook form, guestbook page, and a hotlist page.
After the file name is confirmed, clients can view their completed
web page.

Web Communications provides a guest account which can be used by
anybody on the Internet to try out the WebCom Instant Site Service.
The guest account can also be used by visitors to create their own
custom Web pages, or modify the pages created by the WebCom Instant
Site Service.

Web Communications was founded in May 1994 by Chris Schefler and
Thomas Leavitt to provide tools, resources, and services designed
to assist individuals and organizations to publish and communicate
effectively and affordably over the Internet. The company currently
hosts 1357 individual Web sites. For more information, contact Web
Communications, Chris Schefler (Tel: 408/457-9671).

WebWho. Scientific Research Management Corp. (1714 Ringwood Ave.,
San Jose, CA 95131) offers WebWho (http://webwho.com), which allows
users, for a nominal charge, to create a mini-home page,
approximately 150 words in length, with up to two hyperlinks, and
to define and control their directory listing even if they don't
have an existing Web site, email address or Internet connection.
Web explorers can immediately use WebWho, at no charge, as a Web
navigation directory to locate businesses and individuals on the
Internet. In addition to determining their directory listing, home
page owners will be able to specify up to 20 keywords to further
define their Internet presence. Unlike other Internet navigation
tools, home page owners will be able to dynamically change their
description, hyperlinks and keywords at any time and as often as
they desire.

Customers who already have an Internet presence, can also reap the
benefits of WebWho, by complementing and enhancing their existing
home page. Home page owners can choose the search category,
keywords, description text, and hyperlinks to their existing home
page or emailbox. The probability that Internet explorers will find
them should be greatly increased.

For more information, contact: Skeeter Wesinger, or Peter Bowen,
both of SRMC (Tel: 408/437-1813, email: info@webwho.com).

CA Real Estate
Online

Many California real estate agents are now able to tap into what
could be the largest online offering of information about homes and
condominiums to date. Members of the Greater Inland Valleys
Multiple Listing Service Inc. (MLS) will be offering their home
listings via the Internet on a system that ties in listings
throughout Southern California. The Homeseekers Web
(http://www.homeseekers.comsite) brings together up to 40,000 home
listings across Southern California, many offering photos and
specific addresses. Homeseekers is the creation of Visual Listings
Inc. (Brea, CA), which is operating kiosk-based New Home Search
systems in shopping malls.

The service has about 3,200 members from several local boards of
Realtors. The site already contains thousands of listings from
regional MLS systems covering Orange County, the Los Angeles area
and the Greater South Bay region. Real estate agents at boards in
the Coachella Valley and High Desert are expected to join the
network soon. And board-operated MLS systems in San Diego County
and elsewhere in the state may also join soon.

The system allows consumers to narrow their search from a wide
selection of criteria, including city, price range, home style
(single-family, condominium) number of bedrooms and baths, size of
garage, and by other features, including formal dining room, pool,
spa, fireplace and family room. Consumers also can limit the search
to only homes where open houses are scheduled so they only are
shown houses they can go and see that day.

Each property listing also has room for one color photo of the
property. Brokers or agents may add up to three more photos per
listing for an additional cost. A 20-second soundtrack also can be
added at extra cost. Many of the listings include the property's
address so consumers can drive by the listing first. Agents also
can have a link to their own Internet home page added to each
property listing. The home page includes a photo and brief resume
and other properties the agent has to offer. They also can add
electronic mail and fax-back capabilities for consumers to use. The
home page costs the broker or agent $50 a year.

Homeseekers joins a growing list of Internet sites offering
property listings. Indeed, there are an estimated 4,800 such Web
sites across the U.S. Unlike other Internet sites, the Homeseekers
and California Association of Realtors Internet sites allow real
estate agents to list their properties for free--they pay no
advertising fee for the service other than the listing rates
already paid to be part of their local MLS. The systems make money
through other companies that sponsor or advertise on the networks.
These "sub-advertisers" pay from $250 to $500 a month to be on the
network, but also must agree to promote their company's presence on
the Internet.

Internet World
Trade Center

A new business-oriented web site (http://www.internetWTC.com)
designed as the virtual equivalent of a skyscraping world trade
tower has opened for business on the World Wide Web. With over 100
floors and a marble-walled lobby, the Internet World Trade Center
(iWTC, Box 5474, Route 46 East, Parsippany, NJ 07054) offers
visitors hundreds of features including investor services; trade
show listings; news and weather updates; hyperlinks to 20 major web
search engines; a medical information facility; an entertainment
and gaming center, and, from its observation deck, downloadable
views of New York's skyline and harbor that are always
spectacularly clear.

Visitors to the Internet World Trade Center enter through its lobby
where a newsstand offers USA Today, Time Magazine, the Financial
Times and many other publications. A tenant directory can be
searched by company name or by product or service. Companies are
grouped by industry. For example, electronics firms are located on
the 11th floor, insurance companies on the 19th and software
developers on the 29th. Government  offices occupy the 15th floor
where visitors can drop in on Congress, the CIA, FBI, and over a
dozen other federal agencies. Those stopping at the 22nd floor
Medical Information Center can gather background on everything from

IRS Promotes
Internet Filing

With the official start of tax filing season, the Internal Revenue
Service has said it is expanding its electronic services. The IRS
is putting more information on the Internet, rolling out a
telephone filing system nationwide and laying plans to expand
filing of tax returns on personal computers.

To reach more taxpayers, or at least those who are computer-
literate, the IRS is improving its online information network, such
as the "Fedworld" Internet home page at http://www.irs.ustreas.gov,
with answers to frequently asked questions and forms that taxpayers
can download. Also this year, taxpayers can file another form that
will direct-deposit refunds into a savings or checking account.

The agency is planning a project called CyberFile that would allow
taxpayers to file electronic returns directly. At present, the IRS
requires that electronic filings be sent via a middleman, such as
a professional tax preparer. The project will start with a test in
six states, but IRS officials say they haven't decided just where
yet.

Visa's New
Electronic Services

Major U.S. financial institutions are implementing a fully
electronic back-end bill-payment system developed by Visa
International (San Francisco, CA), linked to remote-banking
services offered by a growing number of financial institutions.

Visa is commencing electronic bill-payment programs with major U.S.
financial institutions, including Banc One Corp., Barnett Banks,
The Chase Manhattan Bank, Crestar Bank, First Bank System, First
Interstate Bank, First Chicago, First Tennessee Bank, First Union
National Bank, Mellon Bank, Norwest Banks, Star Bank and U.S.
Bancorp. Teaming up with major billers, such as utility companies,
additional financial institutions are expected to utilize Visa's
new turnkey system in first quarter 1996.

In addition to enhancing front-end, remote-banking programs by Visa
Interactive, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa International, and
other providers, Visa's newly U.S.-patented, back-end standard is
expected to significantly reduce remittance-processing
inefficiencies for participating financial institutions and
organizations that bill for goods and services. Visa's back-end
system also enables billers to electronically send invoices to
their customers who pay bills online, expected to be available in
mid-1996, aimed at reducing the cost of printing and mailing
statements.

Many financial services providers and commercial billers currently
offer electronic bill payment systems that are only partly
electronic. Visa estimates that more than 60% of "electronic" bill
payments are converted to paper to complete the payment process.
The Visa solution is fully electronic, improving efficiency for
billers and financial institutions. Future enhancements are
expected to include multi-currency, cross-border payment
settlement.

Sterling Software (Dublin, OH) worked with Visa to enhance
electronic connectivity between financial institutions and billers-
-the final link--to create a turnkey, member-controlled payment
system.

For more information, contact: Greg Jones (Tel: 415-432-2753) or

DATA POINTS

Liberty Financial Companies Inc. (125 High St., Boston, MA
02110) has introduced the WebSaver Annuity on the World Wide Web
(http://www.websaver.com), the first financial product specifically
designed and priced for the Internet. By exploiting the
efficiencies of the Internet, Liberty Financial says, the WebSaver
Annuity lowers its sales and operating costs and then passes those
savings on to the online customer in the form of higher guaranteed
rates. The WebSaver Annuity is a guaranteed return annuity that
allows customers to order a policy online, while funding the policy
with a check sent through traditional mail to avoid potential
security concerns. However, because of local laws, the annuity
product is only available in 24 states.

    Prudential Insurance Co. of America has launched an
interactive World Wide Web site at http://www.prudential.com.
Prudential claims that their site is different from others because
it is 'needs-based,' meaning that it provides consumers with tools
and calculators that can help them figure out, and plan for, their
short-and long-term financial needs. Prudential says it has no
intention of offering actual sales through the Internet.

    According to the Kansai Employers Assn., some 2,000 companies
will start exchanging information via the Internet on both vacant
positions and employees they plan to transfer to other companies,
possibly as early as March 1996. Under the human resources exchange
network project, western Japan-based companies will seek to help
employees being encouraged to look for work elsewhere as a result
of corporate restructuring. The network would allow both companies
and employees who are subject to restructuring to access a database
on human resources and available positions. Proponents of the
system would also like to include companies in Tokyo and Nagoya to
use it. The new system would provide such data as employees'
skills, job careers and annual salaries, while protecting their
privacy.

    The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will soon
go live on the Internet, with a computer database that offers
information on everything from sex to business, to provide material
on its member-nations. The ASEAN home page will give information on
each ASEAN country, reports from their ministerial and security
meetings, documents on the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), economic
cooperation and investment policies of its members. No dates were
immediately available on when ASEAN goes live on the Internet.

INTERNET ACCESS: NEW WORLD WIDE WEB INTERFACE SOFTWARE FROM CUADRA SPURS
"INTRANET" USE; STAR/WEB FROM CUADRA SUPPORTS GROWING TREND AMONG FORTUNE
1000 COMPANIES OF USING WEB TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS

New technology originally designed for use with the Internet World Wide
Web, the global network of publicly accessible computers, is increasingly
being used by Fortune 1000 companies for strictly private use on their
internal networks for in-house communications and information storage and
retrieval.

And STAR/Web, a software product by Cuadra Associates, a leading software
developer based in Los Angeles, is helping them do it.

The use of Web concepts and technology in internal networks is being
widely referred to as "Intranet." One of the major attractions is that it
lets companies give their staff members better access to internal
information resources, regardless of whether they use PCs, Macs,
X-terminals, RISC workstations, or any combination of these.  It also
allows them to store data on a number of different systems, yet access the
data through a common user interface.  Any desktop workstation for which
there is a Web browser can be used to access corporate data easily through
the company's Intranet.

Early adopters of Web technology for in-house information, such as Pacific
Bell and Amdahl Corp., claim that their investments in the Intranet
approach and STAR/Web are already paying off handsomely.  STAR/Web is a
common gateway interface (cgi) program that connects STAR, Cuadra's
powerful information management and retrieval software, to any standard or
commercial Web server so it can be used to provide sophisticated,
interactive information retrieval to large corporate databases.

"Our purchase of STAR/Web has allowed Amdahl to move swiftly towards our
goal of creating a Web window into vast amounts of corporate data which
has previously been locked up on individual machines or on specific
platforms," says Christel Casjens, information specialist at Amdahl Corp.,
a leading data communications supplier.  "It has enabled us to capitalize
on our prior investment of creating a corporate `Intranet', as well as
employee familiarity with the Internet and Web browsers.  All of these
factors make us confident that the tools being built using STAR/Web will
facilitate the flow of timely information to all employees, which can only
lead to greater corporate responsiveness to the changing market
environment."

At Pacific Bell, the incorporation of the Intranet model has changed the
way that the company views and uses information resources.  Pacific Bell
is standardizing desktop tools throughout the company and using STAR/Web
for internal access to the information in its Corporate Intelligence
Center.  "We have been actively exploring ways to exploit other sources of
information," says Ralph Miller, director of the center.  "Departments
within Pacific Bell have developed Web sites to disseminate information to
other departments, so we're experiencing increased awareness and usage of
internal information sources horizontally across the corporation."

Pacific Bell and Amdahl are typical of organizations that have created and
collected a great deal of valuable data -- their "corporate memory" --
stored on a number of different computers using more than one software
package.  Getting access to such data has typically been very difficult to
do, particularly since it involves learning multiple interfaces or search
systems.

Now, with standard Web software and facilitating software such as
STAR/Web, the distributed information model popularized on the Internet
provides an easy solution.  If the search software follows the common
gateway interface standard and the data includes hypertext links, staff
members can use Netscape, Mosaic, and other Web browsers already familiar
to them to search and retrieve information of almost any type or length.
When users find relevant information, they can "click" on hypertext links
and find other, related information, no matter on which computer on the
internal network the data is stored.

The role of STAR/Web in the Intranet model is to support the searching of
large databases, with sophisticated, interactive, assisted searching.
Unlike the typical clicking through menus to find a succession of
"screens," STAR/Web users enjoy a full array of high-performance
interactive information retrieval capabilities appropriate for large
databases representing paper, electronic, and image files.

For more information, contact Cuadra at 310/478-0066, 800/366-1390, fax
310/477-1078, or e-mail to hq@cuadra.com.

Amdahl is  a worldwide supplier of large-scale System/390 compatible
processors, UNIX systems software and servers, data storage subsystems,
data communications products, applications development software, and a
variety of educational and consulting services.  Amdahl products are sold
in more than 30 countries for use across all types of computing
environments.

NEW NETWORK: CONSTRUCTION UNDER WAY ON NEW FIBER-OPTIC NETWORK FOR NEW
ENGLAND

Construction of a new fiber-optic communications network for New England
has begun, FiveCom Inc., of Waltham, Mass., announced today.

"The NEON light is on, and we're moving," said FiveCom president Victor
Colantonio, referring to FiveCom's New England Optical Network
communications project.

"We're installing NEON's 36-mile link between Hartford and Springfield,"
Colantonio said.  "That moves us toward our first-phase goal of a 410-mile
network backbone linking most cities in three New England states by the
end of 1997.  The fiber-optic system will offer high-capacity transmission
of voice, video and data.  We expect to build continuously from that
backbone to serve the entire New England region, and possibly eastern
Canada as well."

The first phase of NEON is being built in the areas of Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire served by the operating companies of
Hartford-based Northeast Utilities.  FiveCom has long-term agreements
allowing it to install fiber-optic cable throughout the utility's service
area.

FiveCom will seek to negotiate similar agreements with other New England
utility companies to expand its reach.  It has secured a letter of intent
from Central Maine Power Co., Maine's largest electric utility.

Construction costs for the first phase of NEON could exceed $30 million,
including tasks such as installing specially manufactured 96-fiber cable.

FiveCom is offering leases of fiber-optic capacity to major carriers that
will be less costly than new construction by the carriers themselves.
"Piggybacking fiber on utility property is a win-win move," Colantonio
said.  "It adds value to an existing asset for the utilities, and offers
carriers a fast and economical option for adding extremely reliable
capacity to their systems."

FiveCom shareholders recently voted to sell a controlling interest in the
privately held company to MaineCom Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Central Maine Power Co.  Besides stock, MaineCom gains seats on FiveCom's
board and contracts for the continued services of FiveCom principals.
Legal and financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.

"This a terrific opportunity for Central Maine Power and MaineCom
Services," said Gerald C. Poulin, chairman of MaineCom's board and a CMP
vice president.  "The technology is proven, the potential market is big,
and FiveCom's position in the market is impressive."

Poulin added, "The relationships we're building by this investment could
lead to new utility partners, joint ventures and strategic alliances that
could promote FiveCom's expansion."

MaineCom Services began operations earlier this year after the Maine
Public Utilities Commission approved CMP's request for permission to
undertake limited diversification into new lines of business in New
England and eastern Canada.  "We've done fee-for-service work and
consulting," said MaineCom president Mark E. Curtis, "but this acquisition
is a critical step toward our business objective."

Curtis said the combination of FiveCom's technical and marketing savvy and
its current facilities agreement make it a very valuable acquisition.
"FiveCom is a young company," he said, "but they've very quickly seized a
commanding position to compete in the carrier market.  We will fully
support their plans to build on that foundation and become a market leader
in the Northeast."

ACQUISITION: AT&T ACQUIRES PHILIPS' PUBLIC NETWORK ASSETS IN EUROPE

AT&T Network Systems and Philips Electronics N.V. have signed the final
purchase agreement under which AT&T has acquired a portion of the public
network assets held by the Philips Communication Systems division.
Financial terms and conditions of the transaction were not disclosed.  The
final agreement follows the memorandum of understanding the two companies
signed July 27.

Under the terms of the contract, AT&T Network Systems has purchased the
assets related to four Philips Communications Systems units:  Cellular
Infrastructure Systems; Managed Transport Networks; Microwave Transmission
and Access; and Transmission.  These assets are currently held by
Telecommunications Radioelectriques et Telephoniques (TRT) of Paris,
France, and Philips Kommunikations Industrie (PKI) of Nuremberg, Germany.

The contract provides for AT&T Network Systems to purchase from Philips
Electronics the legal entity of TRT, and assets of PKI associated with the
acquired business units.  Both TRT and PKI are subsidiaries of Philips.
AT&T Network Systems assumes the TRT legal entity, name and brand while
Philips retains the PKI legal entity and name.

For AT&T Network Systems, the acquisition signals a strengthened
commitment to offer customers worldwide the industry's most robust and
competitive wireless and transmission infrastructure solutions.

Philips' public network communications systems businesses include its
Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) base station equipment; rural
telephony solutions; point-to-point microwave transmission equipment;
wireless local network access using the Digital European Cordless
Telecommunications (DECT) standard; high-speed transmission systems based
on the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) standard; and other public
network systems.

By the end of 1996 -- following the completion of AT&T's restructuring
into three separate companies -- AT&T Network Systems will become an
integral part of a new publicly-traded systems and technology company. The
company will retain the technological expertise and innovation of Bell
Laboratories.

AT&T and Philips will complete the transfer of ownership to AT&T Network
Systems in early 1996.

AT&T Network Systems will assume a global workforce of approximately 3,500
employees from PKI and TRT comprising managers, development staff and
engineers, factory workers and marketing and sales personnel.  The
purchase agreement covers PKI and TRT sales organizations in 25 countries
worldwide.

The acquired assets also include specified commercial, manufacturing and
R&D resources in Nuremberg, Germany, and Paris, Rouen and Lannion, France.
Philips intends to integrate the remaining activities of PKI into Philips
GmbH in Germany, and the remaining TRT activities into the Philips
organization in France.

In line with its Personal Communications strategy, Philips will retain
such products as cellular, corded and cordless telephones; facsimiles and
pagers; and its private network business units in Business Communication
Systems; Data Communications; Private Mobile Radio; and Smart Cards and
Systems.

Philips Electronics of the Netherlands is one of the world's largest
electronics companies, with sales of $33.7 billion in 1994, and some
265,000 employees worldwide.  Its products include lighting, consumer
electronics, recorded music, components, semiconductors, communication
systems, medical systems, industrial electronics, and domestic appliances
and personal care products.

AT&T Network Systems is one of the world's largest providers of
telecommunications equipment, software and end-to-end solutions used by
network service and information providers around the world.

NEW SATELLITE: ECHOSTAR-I LIFT-OFF SUCCESSFUL

EchoStar Communications Corporation ("EchoStar"), announced the successful
lift-off Thursday morning of its first direct broadcast satellite (DBS),
EchoStar-I, from China Great Wall Industry Corporation's Xichang, China
launch facility.

The Lockheed Martin Series 7000 satellite was launched atop an LM-2E
launch vehicle.  It will provide programming from its final location at
119" west longitude for EchoStar's DISH Television Network beginning early
next year.

"EchoStar-I was successfully launched into low-earth orbit at 4:51 a.m.
(MST) today.  This is great news, but it is only the first step," stated
EchoStar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Ergen from the
launch site in Xichang, China.

"We have confirmation that we have successful firing of the third stage,
which will place the satellite in its transfer orbit," commented Carl
Vogel, President of EchoStar Satellite Corporation. "We expect
confirmation of final spacecraft separation and achievement of geotransfer
orbit by 2:00 p.m. (MST) Thursday."

Headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, EchoStar Communications Corporation
is a leading manufacturer and distributor of satellite television systems
worldwide.  EchoStar is developing a state-of-the- art DBS system, the
DISH (Digital Sky Highway) Network, expected to be operational early next
year with programming transmitted from EchoStar-I.  A total of over 200
channels of digital video, audio and data services are expected to be

LOCAL COMPETITION: TIME WARNER COMMUNICATIONS ASKS PUCO TO INTERVENE IN
NEGOTIATIONS WITH AMERITECH

After a year of negotiations, Time Warner Communications says Ameritech is
either unable or unwilling to reach an agreement to interconnect its
network and it is time for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO)
to get involved.

The company said that an agreement with Ameritech "must be concluded by
the parties, with commission intervention or by commission directive, by
mid-January 1996 or the promise of local telephone competition in Ohio
will be even further delayed."

Time Warner Communications made the request for PUCO intervention in its
second 60-day report to the commission on the status of interconnection
negotiations with Ameritech and other monopoly telephone companies.

Time Warner Communications has been negotiating with Ameritech since
December 1994.  "While the parties have clearly reached agreements on all
technical issues necessary for interconnection, the same cannot be said
with respect to the economic aspects of interconnection," the company said
in its letter to PUCO Chairman Craig Glazer.

Although the details of the negotiations are subject to a confidentiality
agreement, Time Warner Communications said that charges proposed by
Ameritech for some key services are excessive and that no cost
justification has been provided by Ameritech.  In addition, "Time Warner
Communications believes that it is not negotiating directly with those
individuals in Ameritech who can finally explain, modify and conclude
interconnection agreements," the report said.

It further stated that negotiations with Ameritech are most critical
because Time Warner Communications plans to begin offering competitive
local telephone service in Ameritech's area first.

The company said it has had only preliminary discussions with Cincinnati
Bell and recently began negotiations with GTE-North. Talks also are
underway with United Telephone of Ohio.

Time Warner Communications was granted a provisional certificate to
provide local telephone service in 37 Ohio counties by the PUCO in August.
Before it can compete with existing telephone companies, it must reach
interconnection agreements with them so customers can make calls to
anyone, regardless of which phone company they use. The PUCO also must
approve certain rules under which telephone companies will compete before
Time Warner enters the market.

Time Warner Communications is a division of Time Warner Cable that is
leading the company's entry into the telephone business.  It currently
provides local telephone service in Rochester, NY and competitive access
service in 15 locations across the country.  Time Warner Cable has four
operating divisions in Ohio serving more than 732,000 customers and
passing 1.2 million homes.

ATM: CASCADE ANNOUNCES SHIPMENT OF THE CASCADE 500 ATM SWITCH; ON-TIME
DELIVERY FROM THE WORLD LEADER IN FRAME RELAY WAN SWITCHING DELIVERS
UNMATCHED ATM SCALABILITY & GUARANTEED END-TO-END QUALITY OF SERVICE

Leveraging its leadership and proven expertise in providing powerful
connection-oriented Frame Relay wide area network (WAN) switches, Cascade
Communications Corp. Thursday announced that it has attained a
breakthrough engineering achievement through rapid market delivery of the
functionally-rich, high-capacity Cascade 500 Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) switch.

With delivery timing as planned, the Cascade 500 has shipped to four
organizations for beta testing, including PSINet Inc. and LDDS WorldCom.
This marks the third delivery of a major system platform from Cascade in
the last three years.

Building upon Cascade's expertise in designing large Frame Relay networks,
the Cascade 500 delivers the industry's highest scalability and
reliability, critical requirements as the number of users on the Internet
and other wide area networks continues to explode and higher-speed
applications are deployed.  Featuring the industry's only quad-plane
architecture and quality-of-service- capable routing software (via
Cascade's Virtual Network Navigator), the Cascade 500 delivers end-to-end
ATM quality of service, guaranteeing simultaneous network transport of
data and multimedia applications.  Seamlessly integrated with Cascade's
standards- compliant B-STDX multiservice switches and fully manageable by
CascadeView, the only standards-compliant WAN network management system,
the Cascade 500 provides a complete solution for cost-efficient and
easy-to- administer high-capacity networks.

"We are pleased that major organizations have not only recognized the
robust ATM capabilities of the Cascade 500, but also its strategic
system-level capabilities within their overall communications initiative,"
said Daniel E. Smith, president and CEO for Cascade.  "With the Cascade
500, we continue to deliver timely, best-of-breed products that meet
real-world customer requirements with complete integration with existing
network systems."

One organization testing the Cascade 500 is Internet giant PSINet Inc.
"With Cascade's B-STDX Frame Relay switches, we have experienced
tremendous success in meeting explosive demand for our Internet services
worldwide," said Martin L. Schoffstall, senior vice president and CTO of
PSINet.  "With availability of the Cascade 500 ATM switch, we will build
upon that success, leveraging the Cascade 500's unique quality of service
and scalability features for the introduction of exciting new
Internet-hosted multimedia applications, such as on-demand interactive
video and voice, and real-time multi-player, multimedia gaming."

"Furthermore, the Cascade 500 and the B-STDX's tight integration and
strict adherence to standards will provide significant service and
management benefits," added Schoffstall.  "From a service standpoint, the
B-STDX's Frame Relay-to-ATM Interworking functions will allow our
customers to seamlessly migrate to ATM without having to incur the cost of
globally upgrading to ATM.  From a management perspective, because both
the B-STDX Frame Relay switch and the Cascade 500 ATM are SNMP-manageable
by CascadeView, we will be able to add this next-generation technology to
our network environment with minimal training and deployment."

Designed as a 16-slot chassis system, the Cascade 500 is a non-blocking
ATM switch with a flexible 2.5, 5 and 10 Gbps capacity. It supports
next-generation speeds of 45, 155 and 622 Mbps and the industry's highest
port density on a single platform, supporting 56 OC-3c/STM-1, 112 DS-3/E3
and 14 OC-12/STM-4 ports.

"Our timely delivery of the Cascade 500 to four robust network
environments for beta testing proves the singular relevance of Frame Relay
expertise to ATM networks," said Chris Baldwin, Cascade's senior product
manager for ATM.  "Beyond the simple mechanics of hardware-based cell
switching, ATM is all connection-management software.  Frame Relay and ATM
share the connection-oriented paradigm.  Cascade's proven leadership in
Frame Relay connection management has given it a leapfrog position in ATM
system design, proven now by our Cascade 500 engineering-delivery
success."

PRICING/AVAILABILITY
With general availability in Q1 `96, the Cascade 500 is priced based on
system configuration, with entry-level pricing starting at $25,000 and

VOICE PROCESSING: ENHANCED SYSTEMS INC., A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF
VODAVI TECHNOLOGY INC., IN VOICE ACTIVATED DIALING AGREEMENT WITH GTE
MOBILNET

Enhanced Systems Inc. (ESI) has been selected as the vendor of choice to
provide Voice Activated Dialing (VAD) systems to GTE Mobilnet.

Michael Mittel, president of ESI, said, "We have been working closely with
GTE Mobilnet on VAD for the past 18 months and of course we are quite
pleased with their decision.  We have built a user interface that we
believe is second to none.  Also, our in-market experience has given us a
unique understanding of the nuances needed to successfully implement voice
recognition technology in a cellular environment.

"We look forward to continuing our close working relationship with GTE to
support their existing VAD systems and to provide systems they may
purchase in the future.  We have also begun development of next generation
systems which will offer a whole new range of features and service
offerings."

GTE made its decision after a thorough analysis from the leading vendors
in the voice recognition industry.  Dave Wasby, product manager for GTE
Mobilnet, said, "Over the past two years we were able to narrow the field
of players in the voice recognition arena to just a few 'best in class'
vendors.  Enhanced Systems was judged to be the best after extensive
in-market testing.  We are pleased to be partnering with a firm as
proactive and technically advanced as Enhanced Systems."

VAD allows cellular customers to use voice commands in order to dial,
simply by recording, then saying the name of the person (or speaking their
phone number).  The product also lets customers control their cellular
voice mailboxes simply by speaking work commands such as play, save,
delete, etc.  Enhanced Systems is one of the first manufacturers to enable
other vendors' voice mail systems with speaker-independent voice
recognition capabilities.

Enhanced Systems Inc., based in Norcross, designs, develops, markets and
supports a line of voice processing and interactive voice response
software products.  The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodavi
Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:VTEK) (VTI) headquartered in Scottsdale, Ariz. and
is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol VTEK.

GTE Mobilnet, headquartered in Atlanta, is a leading mobile cellular
operator in the United States, with the potential of serving some 72
million cellular and personal communication service customers.  The
company is a wholly owned subsidiary of GTE Corp., one of the world's
largest providers of telecommunications services.

FINANCIAL: V BAND REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1995

V Band Corporation (NASDAQ/NML: VBAN) reports sales for the fiscal year
ended Oct. 31, 1995 of $29.4 million, a 6% decrease from sales for fiscal
1994.

Equipment sales decrease 12% from $26.9 million in 1994 to $23.6 million
in 1995.  Service sales increased 41% to $5.8 million in 1995 from $4.1
million in 1994 as the number of customer installations serviced by the
company has increased.  Fourth quarter sales were $7.6 million, a 23%
decrease from the fourth quarter 1994 sales of $9.9 million.

The company reports a net loss for 1995 of $11.6 million, or $2.18 per
share, including a $5.1 million charge for certain non-recurring items and
inventory reserves.  This compares to a net income for 1994 of $1.9
million, or $.35 per share, which included a cumulative income effect of
$1.2 million, or $.23 per share, for the accounting for income taxes
related to adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109.  The net
loss for the fourth quarter of 1995 was $7.0 million, or $1.32 per share.
This compares to net income for the fourth quarter of 1994 of $1.3
million, or $.24 per share, after giving effect to the adoption of FAS No.
109, described above.  The net loss in the fourth quarter of 1995 includes
$5.1 million of non-recurring charges related to a write-off of certain
intangible assets, restructuring charges related to a company-wide
reduction in personnel and increases in inventory reserves related to
older product lines.

Management believes that the restructuring of the company's operations
combined with new product introductions during the year has positioned the
company to achieve profitability in the years ahead.  During the year the
company installed a new management team, reduced total personnel 25% to
the current level of 216, substantially reduced its manufacturing expenses
by out-sourcing production and implemented a new management information
system.

VALUE-ADDED PROVIDERS FILL NICHE FOR BUSINESS
BUT IS IT REALLY EDI?

      Third-party service bureaus for electronic data interchange (EDI)
are a small, but rapidly growing segment of the EDI support industry
that can help smaller businesses comply with federal procurement
mandates.  But some industry insiders we spoke with cautioned against
relying on service bureaus to help you convert your business to
electronic forms.
      "It is not EDI when one is going from computer application to
hard copy and back," says Steve Young, EDI program manager at Mountain
View, Calif.-based Input, a research company.
      But such value-added services (VAS) can offer you everything from
government requests for quotations (RFQs) servicing to off-site EDI
third-party delivery to document faxing-to-EDI, if you know how to
evaluate the vendor and services you need. 

Finding the Easy Way Out

      Not everyone sees the service bureau concept as a good
alternative to doing it yourself, however.  The question has been
raised whether using service bureaus is even true EDI.
      Input's Young says the paperwork that VAS produce is moving
backward and causes more errors because the human element is
reintroduced to the process.  "The point of true EDI eliminates
errors," he added.       
      But VAS see themselves as filling a niche in the EDI spectrum. 
"Our role is to fill in the blank for small business so they are not
compelled to get EDI or use a value-added network (VAN)," says Ken
Kohler, vice president of sales for Comptech, a VAS in Amarillo,
Texas.  
      Kohler says he is amazed at the number of businesses he comes in
contact with that still don't use a computer.  "These are [thriving]
companies that are doing business with the federal government.  Now
they have to do EDI to win a new contract and where are they going to
go to do that," he says.              
      There are a lot of limitations to EDI regarding the sending of
specifications or design alternatives, Kohler maintains.  VAS, on the
other hand, can enhance a small business's reach beyond EDI by
offering the small-and medium-sized enterprise a multitude of
alternatives, other than just doing EDI with one or two clients, he
says.
      VAS break themselves out into different slots, particularly when
it comes to being a provider of government procurement information. 
Some do very little business with commercial companies, but all do
business with government contractors.  The EDI Connection in Torrance,
Calif., for example, specializes in the retail business.  Cathy
Mueller, its president, says her clients range from those with only a
fax machine to fully-integrated EDI companies that just don't want to
bother with going through the process of mapping transactions over
again.  "We are finding that there are more specialty retailers needing
EDI," Mueller says.            
      The most commonly-used standard for Mueller is X12 for its 850
purchase order, 856 ship notice, 997 functional acknowledgement and
864 message text.  
      Mueller says her company will be expanding its services and has
recently signed a reseller agreement with Datamatix for RFQs. 
Datamatix is a certified VAN with the federal government, located in
Plymouth Meeting, Pa.

Going for the International Market

      Trade Point's specialty is expanding trade opportunities by
giving companies international exposure.
      The Columbus, Ohio-based firm uses the World Wide Web to find
domestic and international markets for its clients.  "We show them how
to use research tools, such as Dun & Bradstreet, Price Waterhouse and
the Journal of Commerce," says Christy Bauer, general counsel for
Trade Point. 
      Cataloging company products is another way that VAS can assist
businesses to expand their exposure and to use EDI in taking and
receiving orders. 
      Neither Infomaze in Dayton, Ohio nor Ali Corp in Diamond Bar,
Calif., provide third-party EDI services to commercial clients. 
Instead, they are strictly government-service providers of RFQs to
contractors. 
      Infomaze has a bulletin board service for the U.S. Defense
Logistics Agency.  The Ohio company began its business providing the
information on paper, graduated to diskette and now provides the data
electronically.  
      Ali Corp. has aligned itself with General Electric Information
Services based in Rockville, Md., to offer its clients a VAN.  
      "Pretty soon, all the VANs will be interconnected and everyone
will be able to access information through a number provided by the
federal government," says Sam Saffari, chief information officer of
Ali Corp. 
      The largest growing segment of the VAS provider is the delivery
of RFQs, according to most VAS.  The delivery system for RFQs that uses
FACNET, the federal government's procurement network, has improved and
more government agencies are on board (EDI NEWS, Oct. 2,).  No one has
firm figures reflecting the increase in RFQ volume, but VAS tell us they
expect the volume to double over the next 12 months. (Christy Bauer,

SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE KEY TO OPEN EDI AND INTERNET USE

      Take a multi-track approach in migrating to open-EDI, industry
experts advise small- and medium-sized businesses.  Make sure your
evolution from traditional EDI involves the personnel and a technical
infrastructure that can support multi-platform programming languages,
such as Java, and advancements in intelligent agent technology, these
experts told EDI NEWS.  
      But don't get ahead of the game, they caution:  Movement to the
UN/EDIFACT standard from X12 won't be coming any time soon.  "You
can't do [EDI] across the Web without human intervention," says Shaw.
      That's the lay of the land painted for us as the new year
unfolded--lots of growth in EDI use is expected in the year ahead,
particularly as enterprises move to the Internet.  "A large number of
small- and medium-sized businesses are excited about EDI," says Jack
Shaw, president of the Atlanta, Ga.-based consultancy, Electronic
Commerce Strategies.  "Within two or three years, we'll see a large
number of [these] businesses using EDI across the Internet and using
open EDI."
      "We see great prospects for doing EDI over the Internet," said
Elizabeth Hudson, director of marketing for Concord, Calif.-based
Premenos Technology Corp.  "Although the Internet is still in its
infancy, we foresee a great acceptance of the Internet in 1996."

New Players

     Shaw sees a lot of new players moving into the market in the next
several months, to join the "old savvy" EDI providers.  He cited
Premenos (see related story, p. 8) and Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling
Software, as two companies that can be expected to take advantage of
how "the Internet will change the way EDI is done." 
     But not everyone is convinced EDI will grow, especially in the
banking industry.  "EDI is dead ... Not only have EDI implementations
flattened, they've trailed off," said Mike Alfonsi, who manages the
treasury consulting practice at Philadelphia-based Core States Bank. 
"We've hit a wall with the cost," he said.  Alfonsi anticipates little
growth in EDI at the current price of implementation.
    A consultant who asked not to be named, suggests "EDI is taking on
another form."  Moving transaction information electronically is
available through procurement card data, lockbox imaging and E-mail,
observes this consultant, who added: "Over the short run, no one is
going to make a lot of money on EDI."
    According to The EDI Group Ltd., based in Oak Park, Ill., EDI and
E-mail will be the fastest growing markets in electronic commerce. 
The firm's report puts the total volume of all business-to-business
transactions at exceeding $45 billion and growing at a compound rate
of six percent a year.
    EDI itself has been gaining in use over the last five years, with
an annual growth rate of 24 percent in the United States since 1990
when 12,000 companies were using EDI.  Today 100,000 companies use
EDI, according to The EDI Group.
    The EDI Group sees EDI growing at more than 20 percent a year and
is taking an increasing share of electronic commerce volume.  The EDI
Group cited the transportation services industry as increasing
electronic commerce expenditures 10.2 percent per year, with EDI and
E-mail accounting for most of the growth.  
    On average, the 15 industries included in The EDI Group's market
forecast are increasing electronic messaging by 8.5 percent.  Other
industries in the study included: Retail, manufacturing, health care
and insurance, government, auto/aerospace, chemical, wholesale,
utilities and financial services. 
    The total business-to-business document volume is projected to
increase from 45.5 billion in 1995 to 58 billion in 1999.  EDI's
growth is undeniable but still only a small portion of the potential
marketplace, analysts say.
    But the real action has been on the Internet where use has grown,
and continues to grow, at a much faster rate than EDI alone.  The
World Wide Web hit the scene in July 1993 with 130 sites.  As of July
1995, there were 38,800 Web sites.  At last count, the number of
existing Web sites was doubling every 48 days, said David L. Taylor,
vice president and research director at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner
Group.
    The EDI community wants to merge the Web's exponential growth with
EDI's utility to forge a ubiquitous electronic commerce solution.  If
EDI vendors can secure the Web to the satisfaction of corporate users,
the two technologies should mean easily available, cost-effective
electronic commerce for businesses of any size, the analysts said.
    "A large number of small- and medium-sized businesses are excited
about EDI," said Shaw.  "Within two or three years, we'll see a large
number of [these] businesses using EDI across the Internet and using
open EDI."
    But EDI's growth will be bolstered only if it becomes more
interactive and more Internet-friendly, industry insiders said at the
Electronic Messaging Association's annual Messaging Solutions Summit
(EDI NEWS, Oct. 30, p. 6).  There's still room, though, for
traditional EDI, says Shaw.  

Internet Security

    The race to secure the Internet for EDI use is changing the way
value-added networks (VANs) are offering services, encouraging use of
open systems, and sparking a firestorm of product development,
industry analysts told EDI NEWS (EDI NEWS, Nov. 27, p. 1).
    Users of the Internet are becoming more comfortable with security
products, and are watching how the federal government and private
enterprises are moving ahead in implementing electronic funds
transfers (EFT), product data and credit card orders secured with data
encryption, and digital authentication products.   "There has been a
lot of hype about the potential for break-ins, but now with recent
[product] developments, the Internet is viable," said Iang Jeon,
senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research.
    Premenos' Templar Certification Program, for example, allows EDI
vendors to incorporate Templar with their translation software to
offer secure Internet EDI.  Internet security companies such as
Premenos and Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security are not the
only companies realizing that Internet security is important -- though
they are out in front.
    Maynard, Mass.-based Digital Equipment Corp.'s Digital's new
Internet Services Roadmap also offers a set of secure Internet
services for users and service providers.  Other security companies
taking advantage of the growing acceptance of the Internet for
sensitive data transmission include Netscape Communications Corp. in
Redwood City, Calif. and VeriSign Inc. in Mountain View, Calif.

APL STANDS FIRM IN VISION OF COMPANY AND PRODUCTS

    APL Group Inc.'s strategy for business is to insist on training
potential users on its electronic data interchange (EDI) translation
software products, to be sure they understand just how to use it. 
    Taking control of training has landed APL a profit margin of 67
percent in 1995 sales revenues over 1994 for this year and projections
for 1996 expect to be about the same. 
    "The strategy that has led us to such success is to diversify into
delivering professional services and education along with product
offering," said Stuart Sawabini, president of APL Group.              
    APL takes pride in its ability to provide EDI services to all
levels of users.  "The typical delivery of PC [personal computer]
products to the marketplace come from the Fortune 1000 company.  We
are able to offer strategic level EDI consulting and EDI
implementation services to the HUBs and PC-based solutions to the
supplier," Sawabini said.      
    Big manufacturing companies and government prime contractors have
benefitted from the government's mandate to use EDI for all
procurement processes.  It's the small and medium-sized enterprises
that need more support, Sawabini said. 

A Different Approach

    APL competitor St. Paul Software, based in St. Paul, Minn., designs
and sells translation software, but focuses on multiple platforms
beyond the PC.
    "The final function of what we do is similar, but the majority of
their business is consulting and they [APL] have a translator to go
along with it," said Larry Hastings, vice president of marketing for
St. Paul.
    Hastings said his company focuses mainly on the product and will do
consulting around it.  
    "We just have a different approach--they grew up in the consulting
business and we grew up in systems business," Hastings said.                
    APL client Heavenly Intimates, a manufacturing company in Mt.
Vernon, N.Y., has been using the company's Qualedi translation
software for three years.  "We use it as a front-end for
communications and translation," said Rob Rosenbaum, vice president
for operations.  
    Rosenbaum said he learned of the company at a Kmart suppliers
conference.  "I can process effortlessly 10,000 EDI documents
[transaction] a week," he said.  (Stuart Sawabini, APL Group, 203/762-

FDA TO HOLD JANUARY CONFERENCE ON EDI ADVERSE REPORT FILINGS

    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH) is planning a conference Jan. 25 in
Gaithersburg, Md., to introduce its plans to develop an electronic
data interchange (EDI) system for submission of medical devices
adverse event reports.  The system will be called MEDIC (Medical-Event
Electronic Data Interchange Compact) and will use EDI to automate the
exchange  of "adverse reports"  between the FDA, health device
manufacturers and end-user facilities such as hospitals. 
Manufacturers and hospitals are required by law to file adverse
reports.  The conference will include a forum for industry
representatives to provide input on the MEDIC plan.  (Brenda S. Lucas,
CDRH, 301/827-0027 or fax: 301/827-0038.)

DISA PUBLISHES MODEL EDI AUDIT GUIDE TO TRACK AND VERIFY EDI

    The Legal and Business Controls Work Group of the Accredited
Standards Committee (ASC) X12 of the American National Standards
Institute has developed a "Model EDI Audit Guide."  The guide is
designed to track and verify the trail through which a message is
transmitted from sender to receiver.  It addresses transmission
controls, translating software controls, information security controls
and usage of legal agreements regarding electronic data interchange
(EDI).  The guide provides information for evaluating control issues
that are unique to EDI and is meant to be used as an addendum to
existing application audit programs.  It should prove helpful for EDI
and MIS managers and others who desire a "high-level" understanding of
the objectives and requirements for auditing EDI, the Workgroup said.

STERLING'S GENTRAN:INTEGRATOR PROVIDES INSTANT EDI

    Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling Software introduced the
GENTRAN:Integrator, an electronic data interchange (EDI) tool kit
designed to bring trading communities up-to-speed on EDI.  The
Integrator allows a hub company or system integrator to provide "push
button" EDI to thousands of small suppliers and customers rather than
wait for them to implement EDI on their own.  Hub companies and system
integrators can use GENTRAN:Integrator to install transparent EDI
functionality in existing applications or to give their trading
partners Windows-based input forms and print templates.  (Sterling,

PREMENOS CERTIFICATION CAN HELP YOU TO OFFER SECURE INTERNET EDI

    Software translation developers looking for Internet clients now have an
edge by becoming certified vendors of Premenos Corp.'s Templar Certification
program.  Premenos, a subsidiary of Premenos Technology Corp., started its
program recently to allow interested electronic data interchange (EDI) vendors
to incorporate Templar with their translation software, to offer secure 
EDI over 61the Internet.
    With the Templar Certification Program, customers who have implemented
EDI can utilize the Internet as an inexpensive, high-bandwidth form for EDI
communications, says Elizabeth Hudson, director of marketing for Premenos. 
"We see great prospects for doing EDI over the Internet," she explained. 
"Although the Internet is still in its infancy, we foresee a great 
acceptance oftthe Internet in 1996."  Templar is a suite of standards-based 
software, service and network
solutions designed to enable the secure transmission of end-to-end EDI
documents over open networks.  Templar software is the layer between the mail
agent, such as SMTP/MIME, and the EDI translation software to ensure
confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of both origin and
recipe.
    The first companies to participate are personal computer (PC) EDI
translation vendors Wilton, Conn.-based APL Group, DNS Worldwide and TSI
International.  The APL group is a translation software and services company. 
Its soon to be released Qualedi for Windows was the first to be Templar
certified by Premenos as a solution for PC users to send EDI over the Internet. 
DNS Worldwide, which provides electronic commerce software and services for
PC workstations, has integrated its EDI EDGE electronic commerce products
with Templar for Windows.

Internet Opportunities

    Hugh Stewart, DNS president, said that the number of companies that will
be able to conduct EDI over the Internet "will greatly expand by incorporating
our PC EDI translation software with Templar."
    TSI International, the leader in Windows-based software with more than 85
percent market share of that market, will offer Templar as a transport option
for its thousands of Trading Partner PC kits.  Connie Galley, president of TSI,
said that although TSI customers have always been free to make their own
communications choices, Templar gives them a "viable Internet alternative"
backed by a leading company.
    The certification program is available to vendors from UNIX, AS/400 and
MVS mainframe EDI translation software companies.  EDI software companies
can become certified in less than one week.  (Elizabeth Hudson, Premenos,
510/602-2000.)
