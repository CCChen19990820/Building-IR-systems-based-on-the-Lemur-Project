Betting on confidence in the New Year

Harnessing the energy he used on the campaign trail, the French
president seeks to reopen a dialogue with the people. He hopes
his confidence will be contagious.
In his New Year's message on 31 December 1995, President Jacques
Chirac promised the French a moratorium on tax hikes, a dialogue
on employment and a Europe more focused on social issues.
After emphasizing that "Europe is now more necessary to us than
ever," Chirac declared that he would push the European Union to
make jobs a priority, to be more attentive to daily concerns and
to do more to "meet the social aspirations" of the French.
Chirac admitted that the year-end turmoil could have caused some
to lose the hopes they had held upon his election. The president,
who was voted into office on 7 May 1995, said he would see to it
that such hopes were not dashed. At the same time, he paid
tribute to the "courageous action" of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
In doing so, he bolstered the position of Juppe, whose reform of
the social security system--an institution dear to the French but
in near-bankruptcy--sparked the wave of strikes in key public
sectors, particularly the railways.
In late October, Chirac, a Gaullist who made the battle against
"social divisions" one of his campaign themes, chose to achieve
this goal by reforming government spending. Chirac aims to
decrease France's government deficit from 5 to 3 percent of the
gross domestic product by 1997--a necessary move for French
finances and a condition set in the Maastricht Treaty on European
Union for moving to a single currency by 1999.
In the televised message from his office at the Elysee Palace,
the French leader also promised to hold off on tax increases and
to intensify the battle against unemployment. In addition, he
resolved to lower obligatory withholding taxes, noting that he
had asked the government "to stop resorting to new tax hikes and
social expenditures and to lower these as soon as possible."
Juppe had already announced such a future moratorium.
A new tax, the RDS, or reimbursement of social debt, will be
instituted on February 1 to progressively bring down the $40
billion Social Security deficit.
Chirac also expressed his hope that 1996 will "bring a collective
commitment to adjust and reduce working hours, to encourage
employment and help young people get jobs." Unemployment affects
3 million people in France, 11.5 percent of the work force.
The president ended his speech with the wish that France "embark
upon the future with confidence, because it has chosen progress
and solidarity."

Financing peace

Following the signing in Washington of the interim agreement on
28 September 1995, representatives of the foreign aid community,
Israel and the Palestinian Authority met in Paris on 9 January
1996. The total to be made available to the Palestinian people by
the foreign aid contributors in 1996 is more than $1.365 billion.
Ministers pledged to give a new boost to the aid effort for the
Palestinian people and provide additional support for the peace
and reconciliation process under way in the region.
The participants expressed their firm intention to contribute to
the success of the peace process. According to the French
government, during the ministerial conference, "we have made
commitments. They must be translated into deeds." That is why the
contributors emphasized the importance they attach to the
elections due to take place in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on 20
January 1996.
The conference participants emphasized the importance of
improving the economic and social conditions of the Palestinian
people by creating jobs, improving infrastructures and laying the
foundations for sustained economic development.
In April 1995, the Palestinian Authority,  Israeli government and
the international community adopted a three-pronged plan of
action, designed to reduce the Palestinian budget deficit and
stimulate economic development. The participants welcomed the
signing of a new version of this agreement which takes into
account recent economic and political developments. The Israeli
government will support and facilitate Palestinian economic
development, while the international community has agreed to
contribute to the development of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Palestinian Authority also emphasized the importance of the
basic investment program, adopted unanimously by the Palestinian
cabinet and presented by the Palestinian Authority at the meeting
of the World Bank's consultative group on 18-19 October 1995.
This program, which stresses economic development and job
creation, involves investments totaling 500 million dollars.
Investment projects include roads, wells, schools, hospitals and
water- and infrastructure-related projects.
The aid contributors demonstrated their support for the basic
$550 million investment program and other priority projects
presented by the Palestinian Authority, including the
establishment of industrial zones, the ongoing aid program and
financing of the current $75 million account deficit.
The total to be made available by the foreign aid community in
1996 is more than $1.365 billion. Furthermore, a number of
contributing countries will continue to provide an appreciable
level of aid in kind.

Cult alert

France was warned last week that more tragedies like December's
murder-suicide of 16 members of the Order of the Solar Temple are
possible, and the government was urged to keep closer watch on
cults. A parliamentary commission has urged the government to set
up a special body to monitor such groups.
The commission said cults had the potential to grow rapidly in
France. "In the light of the evidence, the state cannot allow
what many believe to be a veritable tidal wave to develop within
its core,'' the panel said in its report, released in Paris.
The report estimated that there are about 173 cult groups in
France plus another 800 smaller affiliated entities, and
estimated their total membership in France at about 160,000
people. It said a new watchdog body should be set up under the
auspices of the prime minister's office with doctors, legal
experts and sociologists among its members. Its role should be to
monitor cults in cooperation with the various ministries, inform
the prime minister of any developing problems and propose
strategies for handling potentially dangerous activities.
"To remain passive would not only be irresponsible with regard to
those who are affected (by cults) or open to their influence, but
a threat to the democratic principles on which our republic is
founded. It is thus necessary to act.''
The report appeared less than three weeks after the discovery in
a remote Alpine area in southeastern France of 16 bodies
belonging to the Order of the Solar Temple, a cult based in
Switzerland.

The Pope in France in September

Pope John Paul II will visit France in September of this year,
for the 1,500th anniversary of Roman Catholicism as France's
principal religion. The Pope will be in the country from
September 19 to 22, for his sixth visit to France. He will visit
the Loire valley, Brittany and  Reims. In 496, King Clovis
converted to Christianity and was the first ruler to submit
himself to the authority of the Church, giving France the
traditional name of the "oldest daughter of the Church."
The fifth underground nuclear test took place on December 27. The
energy released was less than 30 kilotons.

l'Evenement en bref

Last issue
The low-cost, full-color daily InfoMatin published its last issue
January 8, two years after its launching. Despite a strong start
with sales above 200,000 copies in January 1994, circulation
quickly dropped to 70,000 copies. It needed to sell 130,000 to
break even. One week later the major conservative French daily Le
Figaro celebrated its 170th anniversary.
Botton affair
The appeals court of Lyon handed down stiffer sentences than the
original court's ruling to the three principal defendants in the
Botton political corruption affair. Pierre Botton had been
charged with misappropriating $5 million from firms he controlled
and with making payments to former Lyon mayor Michel Noir and
current Cannes mayor Michel Mouillot to gain influence and public
contracts. The court gave the two mayors suspended 18-month jail
terms, and sentenced Botton to three and a half years in prison.
Popularity
President Chirac and Prime Minister Juppe enjoyed a higher
approval rate to begin 1996, according to the Louis Harris
polling institute. Jacques Chirac's job performance is considered
positive by 41 percent (up 13 percent) of the French while Alain
Juppe received a job performance rate of 34 percent (up 7
percent). Despite this improvement, 59 percent of the French
believe that the government is going in the wrong direction.

Popular and solemn

Former President Francois Mitterrand, who died peacefully in his
apartment at the age of 79 only eight months after leaving
office, preferred an intimate burial to a state funeral. A
military band played Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," the anthem of the
European Union that Mitterrand worked so hard to build during his
14 years in office, as the flag-draped oak coffin carried by
military pallbearers set out through the narrow streets of
Jarnac, his birthplace. Two hundred fifty miles away in the
nation's capital, world leaders bade farewell to the Socialist
leader at a requiem mass, with 1,300 French and foreign
dignitaries present in Notre Dame Cathedral led by Cardinal
Jean-Marie Lustiger.
German chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mitterrand's partner in more than
a decade of energetic European integration, wept openly in Notre
Dame and Cuban president Fidel Castro, one of 65 heads of state
and government present, also cried. Kohl, the head of state who
had met with Mitterrand the most, mourned "a good friend," adding
that  "Europe [had] lost a great statesman."
President Clinton said "the entire world benefited from his
strong and principled leadership,'' calling him a "man of
vision'' (see next page).
Before the Paris services, Mitterrand's Gaullist successor
Jacques Chirac met Russian president Boris Yeltsin and American
vice president Al Gore at the Elysee Palace.
British Prime Minister John Major and U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali were among the foreign mourners. "President
Mitterrand was a very big figure in European history. It will be
recognized in due course by history," said Major. Margaret
Thatcher, despite political differences, "liked and respected"
Mitterrand, adding that he "had become for the rest of the world
a symbol of the essence of France."
From the Middle East, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli
prime minister Shimon Peres and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak
sat close to each other in the cathedral.
Peres, a fellow Socialist and old friend, said Mitterrand's
message was universal and reached far beyond France's borders.
Calling the late president "an unusual combination of culture and
justice,'' Peres said: "We shall miss him very much.''
In Jarnac, the town of 5,000 in southwestern France where
Mitterrand was born in 1916, a private mass was held in Saint
Pierre Church before Mitterrand was buried in the family tomb.
His widow Danielle, sons Gilbert and Jean-Christophe, Mazarine,
his daughter born out of wedlock, her mother Anne Pingeot and
former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas attended the ceremony.
"Adieu" was the most frequently used word in French newspapers,
many of which published photos of a huge public tribute at Paris'
Place de la Bastille held the day before, beneath a giant poster
of Mitterrand waving goodbye. Tens of thousands of supporters
laid red roses, the symbol of the Socialist Party, at the square
and outside the floodlit residence near the Eiffel Tower where he
died. Many wept in the square, a rallying point for the French
Left since the 1789 French Revolution, especially when American
soprano Barbara Hendricks sang "Le Temps des Cerises," anthem of
the 1871 Paris Commune rebels.
According to a poll conducted at the request of state-owned
television station France 2 and the weekly Le Point, Francois
Mitterrand was considered a "great statesman" by an overwhelming
93 percent of French citizens.
As the famous Edith Piaf song goes and as those paying hommage at
the Bastille cried, "Non, rien de rien, je ne regrette rien."

Death of Francois Mitterrand

Excerpts from a speech by President Jacques Chirac
Paris, 8 January 1996
"My dear compatriots,
President Francois Mitterrand died this morning. The French
people learned with shock of the passing of the man who guided
them over 14 years.
I would like not only to salute the memory of the statesman, but
also to pay tribute to the man, with his rich and complex
character.
Francois Mitterrand--his works. A great reader and lover of fine
books, writing for him was as natural as breathing. (...)
Francois Mitterrand--his resolve. The resolve to serve certain
ideals. Solidarity and social justice. The humanist message of
which our country is the bearer and which is rooted in the very
heart of our traditions. Europe, one in which France, reconciled
with Germany and working with it, would occupy a leading place.
But also a way of living our democracy. A modern, now calm
democracy, thanks in particular to the smooth changeover of
political power. (...)
In politics, Francois Mitterrand had first of all a profound
respect for the individual, and that is why he decided to abolish
the death penalty. A respect too for human rights:  he
continually stepped in wherever they were flouted. (...)
But it is, I believe, Francois Mitterrand's life which is
paramount. (...) He espoused his century. Over 50 years spent in
the center of the political arena, at the heart of things in the
process of being achieved. The war. The Resistance. The elected
offices. (...)
But Francois Mitterrand cannot be reduced to his career. He lived
his life more than to the full because he had a passion for life,
one which nurtured and allowed his dialogue with death. Life in
all its forms. Life in its dark and its glorious moments. The
life of the land, of our countryside, of that rural France he
loved so much, almost carnally (...).
Because he had a passion for friendship, loyalty to friends was
for him an article of faith, which prevailed over all others. He
aroused in return deep loyalties, through the years and trials.
My situation is a singular one, since I was President Francois
Mitterrand's adversary. But I was also his prime minister and am
today his successor. All this creates a special tie, which
includes respect for the statesman and admiration for the private
man who fought illness with remarkable courage, in a sense,
eyeing it with disdain, and constantly winning victories over it.
From these contrasting, but longstanding relations, I have
learned the strength of courage when it is backed up by
willpower, the need to put the human being at the center of any
project and the importance of experience.
In this evening of mourning in our country, I extend my feelings
of respect and sympathy to Madame Mitterrand and her family. As
Francois Mitterrand becomes part of history, I should like us to
ponder his message."

A dependable, yet independent ally

Mitterrand embodied the traditional mixture of solid fraternity
in critical situations and small irritants that characterizes the
friendship between France and the United States.
During his 14 years as French president, Francois Mitterrand
proved to be a dependable and yet independent ally to three
American presidents, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton.
The solid bond of longstanding friendship uniting France and the
United States was in no way compromised by political differences
between the Socialist French President and Ronald Reagan.
Mitterrand stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States
during the Soviet challenges of the early 1980s, the Gulf War and
the peaceful revolutions that ended East-West divisions, as
President Clinton recalled on January 9, two days before Vice
President Al Gore headed the U.S. delegation to the former
leader's funeral.
French support at the end of the Cold War proved to be essential,
as evidenced by Francois Mitterrand's key speech before the
German Bundestag in 1983 stating that "pacifism is in the West
and euromissiles are in the East" at a time when German public
opinion was opposed to the deployment of Pershing 2s. This
endorsment of American policy in Europe coming from the leader of
Germany's closest friend, a country long known for putting great
store in its independence toward the superpowers, had tremendous
impact.
President Clinton paid tribute to Francois Mitterrand, calling
him "a man of vision'' whose stalwart leadership helped end the
Cold War and unify Europe. "Not only France but the United States
and the entire world benefited from his strong and principled
leadership,'' Clinton said.
"I consulted frequently with President Mitterrand, as did my
predecessors, and greatly valued his insights, advice and wisdom.
He was a man of vision whose strength helped bring Europe and the
West through a period of tough confrontation to the peaceful,
undivided Europe we are building today.''
These sentiments were echoed by former President George Bush who
worked closely with Mitterrand during the 1991 Gulf War.
''Francois Mitterrand was a great friend and steadfast ally for
the United States. He was a man of his word, and I had great
respect for his intellect and his innate sense of decency. To be
sure, he was one of the great leaders of our time,'' said Bush.
"He laid aside the historic Iraq-French relationship to make a
point that aggression should not stand, that a bully cannot take
over another country, that one member of the United Nations must
not subjugate and wipe out the sovereignty of another,'' Bush
told France-3 television from his Texas home,  referring to the
Gulf War.

"We are the Mitterrand Generation"

It started 10 May 1981. That day, the election of France's first
Socialist president of the Fifth Republic marked the birth of
what would be dubbed seven years later in a reelection slogan the
"Mitterrand generation"--an age group too young to take a serious
interest in Valery Giscard d'Estaing's presidency and which
would, from 1981 to 1995, know one sole occupant of the Elysee
Palace--Francois Mitterrand.
For many, that May 10 was a cause for major celebration, but
others feared the Red Army itself would march down the Champs
Elysees. In 1981, its shadow still loomed large and the Eastern
bloc and the Iron Curtain were realities. This fear was, of
course, unfounded, but came from a generation which had grown up
with the Cold War.
The Mitterrand generation, however, over the course of time had
to reevaluate a large part of what they had been obligated to
learn to earn their baccalaureats: the Berlin wall fell, borders
changed, atlases become obsolete, the Soviet bloc fell apart and
the European Union continued to grow, despite it all.
These same young people witnessed major changes on the
technological front as well. The high-speed train (TGV) became a
reality in 1981, and Great Britain would no longer be considered
the "isolated kingdom" thanks to the Eurotunnel built beneath the
English Channel. The Mitterrand generation learned to use the
Minitel and, later, PCs, laptops and the Internet. Computers,
which made a limited appearance in lycees at the end of the
1970s, were suddenly accessible to everybody.
The Mitterrand generation contributed to the emergence of new
social and humanitarian causes. They gave money to finance air
shipments of rice and medicine to the starving in Somalia,
attended concerts by their favorite singers to raise money for
Armenian earthquake victims and rallied around the comedian
Coluche and his "Restos du Coeur" (see NFF 95-20, p.6) for the
poor and homeless.
  They witnessed the emergence of the suburbs as an entity that
felt the need to express itself--often violently. The children of
immigrants (mostly from North Africa) constituted an important
part of the Mitterrand generation, and SOS-Racisme leader Harlem
Desir became the spokesman for an integration movement that would
see the wearing of the Islamic scarf in the classroom become a
major issue throughout the country.
   In the arts world, the Mitterrand generation even had its own
Minister of Culture in Jack Lang. Rap music, which took root in
the surburbs, found its place on the official list of
"beaux-arts" thanks to Lang, whom they considered "incredibly
hip."
What lessons did the Mitterrand generation learn from its 14
years with the President? Maybe the acceptance of all sorts of
"cohabitation": pleasure and morality, show business and
humanitarian crusades, a Gaullist prime minister and a Socialist
president.
Toward the end of his second presidential term, Francois
Mitterrand stated in his own self-effacing manner," Just think
that for as long as young people aged 15 to 20 have been
politically aware, they have known only me. If I were in their
shoes, I'd be a little tired."

A lifetime serving France

Francois Mitterrand was born on 26 October 1916 in Jarnac
(Charente). His father was then employed by the Paris-Orleans
Railway Company.
After studying law, arts and political science at the University
of Paris, Francois Mitterrand was drafted into the army in 1939.
Wounded, taken prisoner and transferred to a camp in the middle
of Germany during the Second World War, he escaped successfully
at his third attempt in 1942. On his return to France, he
immediately joined the Resistance. Sent on missions to London and
Algiers-- where he was received by General de Gaulle -- he was
keen to return to Occupied France to continue the fight there,
which he did on 26 February 1944. In the underground movement, de
Gaulle appointed Mitterrand Secretary-General for Prisoners of
War, Deportees and Refugees. In this capacity, he took part in
the first Council meeting of the French Republic's Provisional
Government in liberated Paris on 27 August 1944.
In 1944, he married Danielle Gouze, whom he met in the
Resistance. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre at the age of 18.
They went on to have two sons, Jean-Christophe and Gilbert.
In 1945, Mitterrand joined the Union Democratique et Socialiste
de la Resistance (UDSR), formed out of various Resistance
movements. In 1946, he was elected Deputy for Nievre. He remained
a member of Parliament for this department until May 1981, except
for four months in 1958. He represented Nievre in the Senate from
1959 to 1962. During those 35 years, he held numerous local
elective posts, including those of mayor of Chateau-Chinon,
general councillor of Montsauche, president of the Association of
Mayors and president of the Nievre General Council.
During the 12 years of the Fourth Republic (from 1946 to 1958)
Mitterrand held office in several governments. In 1947, at the
age of 30, he was the youngest minister in a century. His
ministerial career was marked by a number of initiatives
heralding, starting in 1950, the decolonization of Black Africa.
In May 1958, Francois Mitterrand became one of the main
opposition leaders.
In the 1965 presidential election, he was the sole candidate of
the Left. He won 32 percent of the votes cast in the first ballot
and in the second, on 19 December 1965, when General de Gaulle
was re-elected, 45 percent of the electors voted for Francois
Mitterrand.
On 16 June 1971, at the Epinay Congress, Mitterrand was elected
first secretary of the Socialist party, an office he held until
1981. In June 1972, on behalf of the Socialists, he concluded an
agreement with the French Communist party and left-wing radicals:
the Common Government Program of the Parties of the Left.
In the 1974 presidential election, Mitterrand was again the
Left's sole candidate. In the second ballot, he won 49.19 percent
of the votes. Valery Giscard d'Estaing obtained 50.81 percent and
was thus elected.
On 10 May 1981, Francois Mitterrand won 51.75 percent of the
votes cast and became president of the French Republic. On 8 May
1988, he obtained 54.02 percent of the vote and was reelected
president of the French Republic. This second term ended on 17
May 1995.

Summary of articles previously published by News from France

"France is our homeland, Europe, our future"
Francois Mitterrand's steadfast commitment to a united Europe was
one unwavering point in his diplomatic policy. The president of
the Republic referred to the eventual unification of Europe as
the  the most important undertaking of our generation. This
unflinching will to serve Europe earned him the nickname
"Mitterrand the European."
--NFF05/12/95--
From the Cold War to a New World Order
During his long tenure as president of the Republic, Francois
Mitterrand had shown himself to be a loyal ally of Western
nations. However, his achievements in foreign policy are not
limited to the confines of the Continent. President Mitterrand
had never wavered in his convictions concerning the Arab-Israeli
conflict, declaring himself to be both a friend of Israel and a
proponent of Palestinian self-determination. The French praise
Mitterrand for the prestige that he brought to their nation on
the international stage.
-NFF04/28/95-
Fourteen years of domestic policy
Elected president on 10 May 1981, Mitterrand quickly left his
mark on French domestic policy through the abolition of the death
penalty in October  1981. During Mitterrand's first months in
office, important laws to protect workers were enacted. On the
economic front, the priority was lowering the inflation rate and
building a strong franc. When Mitterrand was re-elected in May
1988, he stressed political reconciliation and unity. In November
1988, the "minimum income for integration" (RMI) was created as a
safety net for those individuals who were not eligible for
unemployment benefits.

Fifty years in politics
Francois Mitterrand had a rich political experience before
serving two terms as president of the Republic. He was the first
Socialist to lead the Fifth Republic and the second Socialist
president in French history. With the parliamentary victory of
the Right in 1986, then-Prime Minister Laurent Fabius stepped
down and a period of  "cohabitation" began with Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac. In 1988 Mitterrand became the first president to
be elected twice through universal suffrage.
-NFF04/28/95-
Cultural advocate
Under Mitterrand's presidencies, education was accorded top
priority. In 1991, it was allotted for the first time in the
history of France, the largest portion of the budget, exceeding
military expenses. Speaking on the importance of education and
the transfer of knowledge, Francois Mitterrand said, "They must
be the permanent underlying fundamental preoccupation of all
political leaders."

Where did all the farmers go?

The farming workforce is six times smaller than 50 years ago,
according to a study published by the National Statistics
Institute.
The report emphasizes the dramatic change in farming with the
normalization of French agriculture which moved closer to western
standards through concentration, mechanization and education.
Ten million people were dependent on agriculture for their
livelihood in 1945. Farming households accounted for 2.5 million
in 1993. Young people and women in particular have left the farm.
Hence the farming population has become older and more male.
Thirty percent of the farmers aged 30 to 34 were bachelors in
1993 compared with 18 percent in 1978.
This decline in marriage is not offset by couples living
together, a situation that barely exists in the farming
population. In the early 1960s, almost every spouse was working
on the farm; 40 percent now work outside.
Concentration is the other major trend of the last 40 years, with
the average farming surface increasing from 34,500 acres to
87,000 acres. This was made possible by mechanization. The number
of tractors increased from 100,000 in 1948 to 1.4 million in
1993. Progress in productivity  also explains the fact that the
amount of working hours have decreased three fold, compared with
30 years ago.
Half of farms are specialized in livestock farming, 18 percent in
general agriculture and 12 percent in viticulture. The
modernization of agriculture and the generalization of modern
farm machinery have made it necessary to restructure by
regrouping parcels of land under cultivation, and mechanization
has resulted in greatly increased productivity.
The decline in the agricultural population has been encouraged by
the lowering of the farmers' retirement age to 60 in 1986,
resulted in the rejuvenation of the sector. Older farmers used to
work with their sons, who would subsequently take over from them.
This is no longer the case as retired farmers tend to leave the
land. Less than a third of retiring farmers are
replaced--generally by their sons--compared with half in the
1960s. Meanwhile farmers have become more skilled and educated,
as farming is now being considered a profession like any other.
   French agricultural production represents approximately 23
percent of E.U. production as a whole, making France Europe's
number-one farm country. Agriculture accounted for 2.5 percent of
the commercial GDP in 1993 and the added value of the
food-processing industry for 3.4 percent. The trade account in
the food-processing sector (raw materials and manufactured
products) hit 56.9 billion francs ($10.3 billion) in 1993,
exceeding by 3.3 billion francs ($0.6 billion) its 1992 record.
In addition, the trade surplus in food products reached 24.7
billion francs ($4 billion) in 1993, 4.8 billion ($0.8 billion)
more than in 1992. In value, France is the world's second biggest
exporter of processed foods after the United States.

Corsican dialogue

Prime Minister Alain Juppe set up last tuesday a new ministerial
group to work out social and economic plans for the French
Mediterranean island of Corsica but ruled out bowing to
nationalist demands for autonomy.
Juppe met parliamentarians from the island, rocked by 44 bomb
attacks so far in 1996 after 602 in 1995, and asserted that Paris
would reassert the rule of law in Corsica. The inter-ministerial
working group will submit proposals on Corsica's economic and
social problems. The prime minister indicated that "a
modification of the institutions of the island was not on the
agenda."
A few days beforehand, Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre paved
the way for dialogue between the state and Corsican nationalists
during a two day visit to the island. Preceding the visit, the
hardline "historic wing'' of the outlawed Corsican National
Liberation Front (FLNC) called a three-month truce in bombings at
a secretive news conference, with a show of force by about 600
hooded and heavily-armed men.
Following several meetings with elected officials of the island,
Debre stated "the moment has come to move on to a positive
dialogue." A dialogue should help "solve the three great chapters
of the Corsican problem ...The state will remain in Corsica just
as Corsica will remain in France," he reminded his audience.

Societe en bref

Vigipirate scaled down
From the implementation of the security plan "Vigipirate" on
September 7, to December 18, 70,500 people were taken in for
questioning where an eventual 21,540 people were charged with
crimes or misdemeanors, and some 2,324 were deported. In
addition, increased border controls led to 19,972 people being
denied entrance into France. The anti-terrorism plan "Vigipirate"
was scaled down earlier this week.
Ariane launches U.S. satellite
Western Europe's 82nd Ariane rocket blasted off into space from
French Guiana last Friday, putting a U.S. and a Malaysian
communications satellite into orbit. The launch capacity of their
new Ariane-5 rocket will be increased by more than a ton in the
next five years, enabling it to put two heavy satellites into
space simultaneously and meet booming demand for commercial
launches.
Babies
The birth rate continues to drop in metropolitan France, but
city-dwelling women (except those in Paris) have more children
than their counterparts living in the country, according to the
National Statitics Institute (INSEE). In rural areas, women are
having fewer children--a recent evolution, since in 1975 the
birth rate in the country was five to ten percent above the
national average.
Urban activism
Just before the announcement of the prime minister's plan to aid
the suburbs, SOS-Racisme and the National Federation of Youth
Centers (Maison des Potes) announced that a Conference on
Neighborhoods will take place on February 3 and 4. More than 300
urban activists will get together to try to find answers to the
problems confronting urban youths--juvenile delinquency, drug
abuse, housing and unemployment.

From Minitel to Internet

France Telecom announced last Friday its policy concerning the
Internet and the evolution of the Minitel.
France Telecom, which founded the world's first on-line service
with the Minitel, is confronting the stagnation of this service
and the arrival of the Internet which is rapidly becoming the
standard on-line service worldwide.
The company announced that all French citizens will now have
access to the Internet at a local billing rate (8 to 25 centimes
per minute) starting March 15 via their Transpac network. The
provider will pay to have access to Transpac (13,200 francs per
month per 400 subscribers) and will then charge its subscribers
the nominal fee of 25 francs per month, according to France
Telecom. Subscribers currently pay between 60 and 200 francs on
average per month, plus communication costs.
The service will offer e-mail, access to newsgroups, a navigation
guide in French, Internet access to Minitel services, and a
cyberspace shopping site, Wanadoo. The company's decision to
provide its own Internet service follows in the footsteps of
Lagardere, Europe on Line, and already well-established services
like the American firm CompuServe, which currently has 35,000
subscribers in France.
France Telecom's strategy is two-pronged--first, investing in the
Internet, and second, improving available services on the
Minitel, which has been a longtime fixture in many French
households. There are currently 6.5 million Minitel terminals and
14 million users. Aiming at this market, France Telecom has
introduced a new terminal, dubbed the Magis Club, which is eight
times faster than current machines and permits credit card
payments from home.
Francois Beneviste, president of the provider Calvacom and the
French Association of Internet Professionals, praised France
Telecom's decision saying, "It's an excellent measure that will
completely open up the market and make France unique in the
world."
The public operator took to heart the wish expressed by
telecommunications minister Francois Fillon last October to see
French citizens have easy Internet access that would be billed at
local rates. "We must make sure that new developments in
technology do not lead to a two-speed France and that our country
is not behind in the world development of the Internet," Fillon
stated. He praised France Telecom's steps to make the information
superhighway more accessible to all French citizens.

Coup d'Oeil

The French government has enacted a new law to give French
recording artists a chance against more heavily marketed U.S. and
British songs. The law requires that 40 percent of songs played
between 6:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. be of French origin.
Broadcasters risk fines or suspension from the air if they defy
the quotas, which are to be supervised by the government's
broadcasting watchdog. The law has drawn much criticism. French
singer Charles Aznavour defended the quotas saying, "I think it's
sad that we've come to this, but it's something that's become
inevitable, a question of cultural survival."
Archeologists said this past Tuesday they have discovered signs
of human civilization dating back 50,000 years in a cave in
southwestern France, making it the earliest evidence of
cave-dwelling humans. French government archeologists worked
secretly on the site in the town of Bruniquel for the last five
years. "Carbon-14 dating allowed us to scientifically establish
that a bone fragment dates back at least 47,000 years," stated
archeologist Francois Rouzaud. The cave is in the same corner of
France as the world-famous Lascaux caves, which house paintings
and engravings dating back to about 15,000 B.C.

REGION: SUMMIT ON REGIONAL SECURITY
SKIRTS DEMILITARIZATION ISSUE

     The Central American presidential summit held in San
Pedro Sula, Honduras, Dec. 13-15, 1995, ended with serious
disagreement among the six nations represented.  Costa Rica
and Panama blocked or modified almost all proposals having to
do with the military in the Treaty on Central American
Democratic Security--the major agreement to come out of the
summit.
     The signatories agreed on the principle of military
subordination to civilian control, free elections, and respect
for human rights by the military, among other things.  But
demilitarization of the region received scant attention.
     Since 1986, Central American presidents have attended 16
regional summits on such issues as economic integration,
sustainable development, tourism, social spending, and
campaigns against crime, illiteracy, and drug trafficking.
     The San Pedro Sula meeting was perhaps the most
contentious, in part because there is a wider range of
national policies on military matters than on social and
economic problems.  The military aspects of the treaty were
perhaps doomed to failure because neither Costa Rica nor
Panama have military forces, while Guatemala, with the largest
army in Central America, is still involved in a civil war.
     The theme of the summit was regional security, which
included a regional approach to such problems as public safety
and collective security from aggressors.  However, objections
from Costa Rica and Panama forced the elimination of some
provisions and considerable revision of others.
     Both the Panamanian and Costa Rican delegates arrived at
San Pedro Sula to press for armed forces reduction, but
resistance from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and
Nicaragua to anything more than a nonbinding commitment to
future reductions irrevocably split the delegations into two
camps.  Costa Rica and Panama objected to 11 of the treaties
78 articles and signed the treaty with reservations.
     Panama's objections were similar to those of Costa Rica
but with an additional concern that the treaty could
compromise its efforts to sign an agreement with the US
permitting US troops to remain in that country after the
Panama Canal reverts to Panamanian control in the year 2000
(see NotiSur, 12/08/95).  The draft treaty contained a
prohibition against signatory countries permitting foreign
troops on their soil, but this was struck from the final
version.
     Instead of force reductions and the gradual elimination
of armed forces, the treaty as signed only calls for a
"reasonable balance" among the military forces of the region
and a promise to work toward arms limitations and a "proper
correlation" between force size and national budgets.
     Costa Rican sources said that Foreign Minister Fernando
Naranjo objected to an article that calls for the creation of
a mutual defense mechanism to combat aggression within the
region.  The concern, said the sources, was that in making
claims to sovereignty over Belize, Guatemala could define that
country as a possible aggressor.
     "Costa Rica wants to be sure that the [treaty] content is
not...conditioned upon special issues that affect only some
countries," said Costa Rica's roving ambassador to Central
America, Luis Solis.
     Other objections were to articles that urged each nation
to take its constitution into account when setting budget
levels for the military, and to issue a report on the size,
budget, and expenditures of its armed forces.  Observers at
the summit explained that Panama and Costa Rica raised general
objections to these and other military articles because they
did not go far enough in requiring all nations in the region
to reduce the role of the military in national affairs.
     What Costa Rica wanted instead, said Solis, was a treaty
that emphasized nonmilitary aspects of Central American
security--such as public safety--rather than national defense.
Armed forces, he said, should be made smaller and police
forces given more training and a higher priority than the
military.
     Commenting on the lack of interest in demilitarization on
the part of his Central American colleagues, Naranjo said,
"They would not accept [our proposal] and we were not able to
endorse anything that had to do with military matters, unless
they dealt with reductions."
     Both sides on the force-reduction issue attempted to end
the summit on a note of harmony.  Costa Rican President Jose
Maria Figueres promised to continue pushing for force
reductions, "but we will do it in a respectful manner without
trying to impose our opinions and models on anyone," he said.
     For his part, Honduran Foreign Minister Delmer Urbizo
said that the contentious military aspects of the treaty could
be signed on another occasion without harming the San Pedro
Sula summit, which he said focused on the broader definition
of security as a response to social problems.
     "If the theme of military security is an obstacle to
having a successful summit, we will simply cut it from the
agenda and sign it later," he said.
     However, the differences in policy views highlighted at
the summit suggest that the signing of a comprehensive
military accord may be a long way off.  Though Costa Rica's
chief proposal was for the gradual reduction in the size of
armies, a more fundamental aspect of the clash of policies
lies in the differing concepts of the military's role in the
post-Cold War era.
     Col. Francisco Bustillo of the Honduran armed forces
general staff pointed out the changed historical
circumstances.
     "The role played by our countries was the one assigned by
foreign interests, based on a political-military thesis," said
Bustillo.  Now, "geoeconomics has been substituted for
geopolitics, and the political map is no longer drawn along
ideological lines."  Bustillo added that the present dangers
are not military but social and economic.
     Bustillo was expressing the conceptual foundation for the
argument that the military must be called upon to respond to
threats in the social and economic spheres.  By extending the
definition of national and regional security beyond
traditional notions of national defense to include social
well-being, military forces will continue to merit high
priority in national budgetary considerations.
     Echoing Bustillo, Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Ernesto
Leal argued that in this model for security, armies may be
deployed to fight against drugs, to support environmental
protection efforts, to construct schools and clinics, and to
respond to natural disasters.
     "The most important thing," said Leal, "is that the
treaty confirms the subordination of military power to
civilian power."
     Nevertheless, Costa Rican delegates were skeptical that
this confirmation will guarantee effective control of the
military precisely because the treaty "leaves the door open
for the armies to assume new roles."
     The delegates had less difficulty agreeing to an accord
providing for common action against auto theft and mechanisms
for the return of stolen autos recovered outside their country
of origin.  They also announced that they had signed an
agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for
assistance in building a regional electric-power grid.
     But these accomplishments were not enough to head off
severe criticism of the summit.  The auxiliary bishop of San
Salvador, Gregorio Rosa Chavez, said, "The summit gave short
shrift to issues vital for true democratic security in Central
America," and he faulted the presidents for a "lack of
audacity."
     Other critics of the summit pointed to the demonstrations
that took place on Dec. 13 during the inauguration of the
summit as an example of heads of state turning a deaf ear to
social issues.  Seven demonstrators were shot, one fatally, by
unknown assailants.  The demonstration was organized to demand
an investigation into the shooting deaths by the police of
three campesinos taking part in a previous demonstration.
     The advisory committee on Central American integration
(Comite Consultivo del Sistema de Integracion Centroamericano
(CC-SICA) faulted the summit for not including representative
social participation in the formulation of the treaty.
     The president of the Center for Social Training (Centro
de Capacitacion Social) in Panama, Celia Sanjur, said that
"the lack of participatory democracy and the inability of
governments to satisfy the needs of the population" directly
affect regional security.  [Sources: Associated Press,

HAITI: RENE PREVAL WINS PRESIDENCY, NOW FACES
SERIOUS DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES (Part 1)

     In the Dec. 17 Haitian presidential elections,
Organisation Politique Lavalas (OPL) candidate Rene Preval won
a sweeping victory, taking 89% of the vote, according to
official results from the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
While voting was carried out without incident, turnout was
very low, at just under 28%.
     Although fourteen candidates participated in the election
to succeed President Jean Bertrand Aristide, the outcome was
never in doubt.  From Nov. 15, when Lavalas announced that
Preval would be its candidate, his victory was practically
assured, since an estimated 80% of the population are Lavalas
loyalists.  However, winning the election will likely prove
much easier for the president-elect than resolving Haiti's
social and economic problems.
     An agronomist who completed his higher education in
Belgium, the 52-year-old Preval served as prime minister in
Aristide's first cabinet from February 1991 to September 1991,
when Aristide was toppled ie been extended to make up for
the three years that he was forced to spend in exile.  Even
many among the Haitian elite and business community said the
nation's stability would have been better served by Aristide's
continuation in office.
     A wave of violence in the weeks preceding the elections
had raised questions about whether voting would actually take
place on schedule.  In an emotional speech Nov. 11, following
the execution-style killing of his cousin and newly elected
deputy Jean-Hubert Feuille, Aristide blasted the US and UN for
not disarming the country and urged the public to help do so.
     "If those who have weapons, those who have big armored
tanks, those who have much power, wanted to help us, the
disarmament would have been done," Aristide said.
     The president called on the public to collaborate with
police by leading them to suspected arms caches.  During the
following week, at least seven people were killed in
demonstrations and protests as people responded to Aristide's
call for public action.
     It was the first time since Aristide returned that he
veered from his message of reconciliation.  However, many of
his backers contend that, in practice, reconciliation has
allowed the supporters of the coup to participate in public
life and, in many cases, to remain armed.  Aristide's message
of reconciliation never had the support of the poor who
suffered the repression of the military and who saw
reconciliation as a synonym for impunity and continued
injustice.
     When Preval assumes office, he, like Aristide, will find
himself in the difficult position of trying to balance the
demands of his supporters with those of the Haitian elite and
the international community, particularly the US.
     "It is a great dilemma," said Harry Numa of the National
Popular Assembly.  "When Aristide tries to please the people,
the bourgeoisie and the US pressure him.  When he wants to
placate the bourgeoisie and Washington, the people tell him
no."
     The Clinton administration pushed hard for Aristide to
fulfill his commitment to step down at the end of his term,
since its portrayal of Haiti as a US foreign policy success
was riding on a smooth transfer of power.  (Cont.)

HAITI: RENE PREVAL WINS PRESIDENCY, NOW FACES
SERIOUS DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES (Part 2)

     However, US policy toward Haiti has been ambivalent at
best.  Although the September 1994 US-led invasion allowed
Aristide to return to power, congressional Republicans have
openly opposed the Haitian leader and Preval may face similar
difficulties because of his closeness to his predecessor.
     In November, the US Congress cut off US$4.5 million in
economic aid to Haiti because the government had not moved
forward with economic reforms, including several controversial
privatizations (see NotiSur, 11/10/95).  The World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have not disbursed another
US$45 million for the same reason.  Even if Preval starts
negotiations immediately after his inauguration, funds will
still not flow again before summer.
     Sen. Jesse Helms, powerful head of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, freed up previously blocked funds for the
Haitian election only because it paved the way for the
turnover to a new leader and the withdrawal of US troops,
which make up a large part of the UN peacekeeping force.
     However, according to an article in the Washington Post
in mid-November, the US is considering staying in Haiti beyond
its scheduled departure date, citing the "inexperience" of the
newly formed civilian police.  On Nov. 30, Adrain Rameau, head
of the Haitian National Police, was fired following several
shootings that critics claim demonstrate the country's new
officers pull their guns too quickly.
     Another issue that will likely carry over after Preval
assumes office centers on the return of more than 150,000
pages of documents that were confiscated from the Front for
the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH), a paramilitary
organization.  US troops seized the documents after the
invasion and then took them to the US.
     Haitian officials said that until now the US refused to
hand over the papers because it feared the information would
embarrass US intelligence agencies.  Washington does not want
to see leaders of paramilitary groups go on trial in Haiti and
"have it emerge that they were paid and supported by American
intelligence," explained one ves arrested by US soldiers.
     The Nation article also contends that weapons were
shipped to FRAPH starting in June 1993 despite the US arms
embargo.  The article says that US diplomats have used the
alleged power of FRAPH to help pressure Aristide's government
on broader political issues.
     Meanwhile, Constant plans to sue the US for US$50 million
for holding him in custody since April 1995.  Constant's
attorneys said he was seeking damages from the government for
"wrongful incarceration."  (Sources: New York Times, 11/28/95;

GUATEMALA: GAP BETWEEN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
CLOSES SUBSTANTIALLY AS RUNOFF ELECTION NEARS

     The latest opinion polls indicate that Guatemala's two
runoff presidential candidates will fight a close battle to
win the second round of elections, scheduled for Jan. 7.  Most
local officials and politicians, however, predict that
abstention in the second round will climb to about 70% of the
registered electorate.
     In late November, Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal
(Tribunal Supremo Electoral, TSE) released the final results
for the Nov. 12 general elections (see NotiSur, 11/10/95 and
11/17/95).  As indicated in the preliminary results reported
in mid-November, Alvaro Arzu--presidential candidate for the
Partido de Avanzada Nacional (PAN)--took first place with
nearly 37% of the votes (see table).  The Frente Republicano
Guatemalteco (FRG) candidate, Alfonso Portillo, took second
place with 22% of the votes.
     The Alianza Nacional--which grouped the Democracia
Cristiana Guatemalteca (DCG), the Union del Centro Nacional
(UCN), and the Partido Social Democrata (PSD) in a tripartite
coalition--took third place with nearly 13%.  The leftist
Frente Democratico Nacional Guatemalteco (FDNG) took fourth
place with nearly 8% of the votes.
     Of the remaining 17 parties that participated in the
elections, only the Partido Libertador Popular (PLP) won more
than 4% of the votes, which is the minimum a party must obtain
to retain its legal status after the elections.  The
Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN) and the Union
Democratica (UD) managed to retain their legal status because
they each won a seat in the National Congress.  But the
remaining 14 parties will now be officially dissolved,
reducing to nine Guatemala's recognized political parties.
     PAN also swept the congressional elections, taking 43 of
the unicameral legislature's 80 seats.  The FRG will form the
second largest bloc in Congress with 21 seats.
     Despite the Alianza Nacional's third place position in
absolute votes won in the elections, the coalition was
dissolved after the elections and the seven congressional
seats won by the Alianza were then divided between the DCG and
the UCN.  Thus, even though the FDNG took fourth place in
total votes, that party is now the third strongest political
force in the legislature, with six congressional seats.
     Finally, PAN won eight of the 20 seats contested in the
elections for the Central American Parliament (Parlacen).  The
FRG took five seats, and the remaining seven seats will be
fairly evenly divided among the Alianza parties, the FDNG, the
PLP, and the UD.

 into a referendum on the general.
     Indeed, Rios Montt has accompanied Portillo throughout
the campaign.  At most campaign rallies since November,
Portillo has limited his speeches to just a few minutes,
allowing the general to dominate the show.
     Apparently, a wave of common and political violence that
has gripped the country since early December is contributing
to Portillo's rise in the polls, since most voters who support
Rios Montt approve of the general's hard-line approach to
crime.  In fact, speculation reigns in Guatemala that the
sharp rise in violence since early December is a deliberate
tactic by extreme-right groups that hope to sway votes in
favor of the FRG, which promises to crack down on crime and
"restore order" to the country.
     Indeed, Francisco Reyes--an FRG congressional deputy who
helped found the party and is one of the organization's
principal leaders--stated in mid-December that if the FRG wins
the elections, Rios Montt will be given control over national
security.
     "The decision has already been taken," said Reyes.  "Gen.
Rios Montt will be made state secretary for national
security."
      Meanwhile, regardless of the closeness of the
presidential race, most local observers expect abstention will
grow dramatically in the runoff election.  In the first round
of voting, only 46% of the registered 3.7 million voters went
to the polls.  The 53% abstention rate in the November
elections was significantly higher than that registered in the
last two presidential elections.  In the first round in 1985,
only 31% of voters abstained from going to the polls, and in
the first round in the 1990 presidential elections, abstention
only reached 44%.
     In the second round on Jan. 7, spokespersons from the
Civil Registry have predicted that at least 65% of registered
voters will abstain.  Independent estimates place the
abstention rate as high as 75%.  [Sources: Prensa Libre

COLOMBIA: CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT
ERNESTO SAMPER SHELVED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE

     On Dec. 14 the legislative commission examining links
between the Cali drug cartel and the 1994 election campaign of
President Ernesto Samper ruled there was insufficient evidence
to launch a full-scale investigation of the president.
Nevertheless, the scandal continues to cast a shadow on the
Samper administration and its relationship with the US.
     The Accusations Commission announced that it had voted
14-to-1 to shelve a preliminary probe into charges that Samper
personally authorized the receipt of US$6 million in Cali
cartel drug money to win the election in 1994.  Eleven of the
committee's 15 members belong to Samper's Partido Liberal.
     Under Colombian law, the commission had three options:
it could have definitely closed the case, meaning that Samper
could not have been investigated on the same charges again; it
could rule--as it did--that there was insufficient evidence to
charge the president, which allows the investigation to be
reopened in the future; or it could have recommended that the
Senate begin impeachment proceedings against the president.
     Charges that drug money found its way into Samper's
campaign first erupted two days after Samper's election in
June 1994.  The investigation by the Accusations Commission
began last August (see NotiSur, 06/24/95, 04/04/95, and
08/25/95).
     The campaign finance scandal, which led to the arrests of
several of Samper's closest political associates--including
former defense minister Fernando Botero and Santiago Medina,
treasurer of Samper's campaign--has soured ties with
Washington and intensified long-standing suspicions about
Colombia's underlying commitment to the anti-drug fight.  The
commission's decision is unlikely to calm the troubled waters.
     US Ambassador Myles Frechette has warned that the US may
remove Colombia's certification as a partner in the fight
against drugs next year, withdrawing key aid and trade
preferences.  Conditional cer a growing number
of Colombians believed that not only Samper but his
conservative rival Andres Pastrana accepted drug money
campaign contributions.  However, a poll published Nov. 19 by
the daily El Tiempo indicated that while 58.3% of Colombians
believed that the drug cartels contributed to Samper's
campaign, 61% said he should not resign.
     After Samper's television appearance following the
commission's decision, his public approval ratings rose.  A
poll take by El Tiempo immediately after the program aired
indicated that the president had convinced 65% of the audience
of his innocence, while 35% continued to believe him guilty.
     In his public address, Samper insisted he would not
resign, saying it would be an act of "cowardice" to abandon
his office in the midst of a crisis.  (Sources: Reuter,
12/13/95, 12/14/95; Agence France-Presse, 12/15/95, 12/20/95;

NATIONAL'S CHALLENGES DON'T THREATEN REFORMS

     Prime Minister Jim Bolger and his National Party will have to
overcome serious obstacles in order to remain in power over the next
five years.  A new proportional voting system, which will give
smaller parties a larger number of seats in Parliament, and disarray
within the National Party may result in a coalition government led by
either Labour or the Alliance Party, which is an amalgamation of
politicians who have left the two major parties.  Tensions over
immigrants and the rights of the Maori, members of the indigenous
population, could result in limited violence and also a voter
backlash against the party in power.  Despite the expected steady
growth and low inflation, high unemployment will remain a problem and
little improvement in living standards will be achieved.  A coalition
government led by Labour or Alliance would carry out more fiscal
expansion than would a National government, but unless the most
extreme members of the Alliance dominated policy, would not reverse
most of the market reforms that have been implemented since 1985.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  NEW ZEALAND

June 28, 1995     A new political party, United New Zealand (UNZ),
                  was formed under the leadership of Clive
                  Matthewson.

July 17, 1995     The governor of the New Zealand Reserve Bank, Don
                  Brash, was forced to warn the financial markets
                  again of the dire consequences if they continued
                  to challenge his anti-inflation campaign.

July 20, 1995     The question of whether New Zealand needs a tough
                  code to control corporate takeover activity caused
                  serious dissension in the Cabinet and the business
                  community.

October 2, 1995   The new Zealand government announced plans to
                  privatize one of the state~s last big assets, a
                  large area of North Island State forests.

PRESIDENT FACES TOUGH ECONOMIC DECISIONS

President Ion Iliescu is favored to win the September 1996
presidential elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a
majority in Parliament.  Despite growing opposition from all sides,
Iliescu will dominate the government as he tries to move the economy
toward integration with the EU.  The privatization program under way
will have limited success.  Budget cutting and market reforms will be
implemented enough to qualify for assistance from the IMF and the EU
but not enough to greatly improve the business climate.  However, the
economy is expected to grow over the next five years, and inflation
will be brought into more tolerable ranges.

STABILITY, BUT LIMITED OPPORTUNITY

The stable federal structure is buttressed by the support of the two
dominant component emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  The federal
government will continue to be led by President Zayed bin Sultan al-
Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; the prime ministership will be held by Sheik
Maktum bin Rashid al-Maktum, the current ruler of Dubai.  If either
leader leaves office for reasons of health, he will be replaced by a
younger member of the respective family.  The pressure for democratic
reform is weak.  Islamic fundamentalism will not seriously threaten
the government.  The economy will remain heavily dependent on oil,
despite attempts at diversification.  As a result, growth will be
modest, at best, and inflation will show some upward movement.
Opportunities for foreign business are expected to be limited,
despite some modest attempts to attract foreign investment through
liberalization.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

January 8, 1995     Sheik Mohammad bin Rashad al-Maktum was named
                    crown prince of Dubai to ensure a smooth
                    succession in the event of his father's death, a
                    move that was welcomed by international business.

January 31, 1995    In a keynote speech, Sheik Mohammad called for
                    rehabilitation of Iraq by the Arab Gulf states.

June 1995           UAE recognized Sheik Hamad as the new ruler of
                    Qatar.  Hamad overthrew his father in a bloodless
                    coup.

June 1995           Business survey rated Dubai the world's largest
                    container port.

Mid-July, 1995      The Iranian government affirmed its claim to the
                    Abu Musa and Tunb islands, saying the islands
                    belong to Iran "eternally."  The UAE persisted
                    with its efforts to refer the dispute to the
                    International Court at The Hague.

Mid-July, 1995      Sheik Abdel Munim al-Ali was arrested for
                    "preaching subversion" and sentenced to
                    deportation.

October 1995        A Filipina maid's death sentence for murdering
                    her employer was changed to 100 lashes and
                    deportation by an Abu Dhabi court after the
                    victim's family agreed to accept blood money.

NO END TO DIVIDED GOVERNMENT

The struggle between President Bill Clinton and the Republic-
controlled Congress over almost all issues will probably not produce
much budgetary reform.  The 1996 presidential and congressional
elections are also not likely to lead to changes in policy direction,
even if the Republican challenger, probably Robert Dole wins the
presidential election.  The most likely result of the elections will
be a slim victory for Clinton and Republican control of both houses.
Protectionist sentiment will increase at the grass roots level, but
it is not likely to be translated into policy.  The economy will
drift while the politicians argue over spending and tax cuts.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  United States

April 19, 1995      A huge car bomb devastated a federal building in
                    Oklahoma City, killing at least 167 people.
                    Timothy Mc Veigh and Terry Nichols were later
                    charged with the bombing.

June 2, 1995        Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady's F-16 was shot
                    down over Bosnia, and he narrowly escaped Serb
                    forces after fleeing his crippled plane.  He was
                    rescued by the Marines six days later.

June 29, 1995       The US Space shuttle Atlantis successfully docked
                    with the Russian station Mir.

November 5, 1995    In national elections, Republicans took control
                    of both houses of Congress for the first time in
                    40 years.

December 1995       A Budget Impasse caused 260,000 federal employees
                    to be temporarily out of work.

December 1995       US troops were sent to Bosnia as part of a NATO
                    mission.

MOUNTING TENSIONS

The centrist government of President Sanchez de Lozada will face
significant cross-pressures for the reminder of its term.  The
successor after the June 1997 elections is likely to be another
centrist regime led by someone from Sanchez de Lozada's National
Revolutionary Movement (MNR), but a victory by a right wing populist
is far from remote.  The commitment to free market policies that
calls for partial privatization of major state-owned industries, and
the reduction of the budget deficit will continue.  However,
pressures from labor and peasants will force more social spending.
In addition, the large role played by coca leaf growers and dealers
in the economy will prevent the strong action against the drug trade
encouraged by the US, which in turn could jeopardize aid and
financial support from the international community.  A right-wing
populist regime led by Carlos Palenque, a radio talk show host who
has significant support among the poor, would raise concerns among
investors about increased spending and a reversal of market reforms.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  BOLIVIA

April 12, 1995      Hundreds of striking teachers and miners, some
                    setting off dynamite and throwing rocks, fought
                    police in La Paz, continuing protests that had
                    left at least 30 people injured.  The strikers
                    have been demanding higher wages and protesting
                    educational and economic reforms.

 June 1995          Half-shares of Ende, the Bolivian state electric
                    company, were sold to foreign investors as a
                    first step in Sanchez de Lozadaas innovative
                    capitalization plan for modernizing state
                    enterprises and creating a pension fund for
                    Bolivians.

September-
October 1995        Sanchez de Lozadaas capitalization plan continued
                    as half-shares of LAB, the state airline, were
                    sold to foreign investors.

October 1995        State of siege resulting from spring strikes is
                    lifted.

December 1995       Max Fernandez dies in plane crash.

CONTE AND HIS REFORMS LOOK SECURE

     Allowing opposition parties and a partially free press,
President Lansana Conte has engineered both his own presidential
election in 1993 and a Parliament controlled by his party in June
1995.  Despite the widespread opposition he has stimulated, none of
the forces arrayed against him control enough resources to topple
him.  The most serious threats to his continuing in office are poor
health or assassination.  In case of unexpected economic decline or
if the opposition is able to put aside its differences and unite, a
national conference could emerge that leads to a civilian regime.
Despite past military involvement in politics, a coup is unlikely.
Conte will continue to support limited austerity and liberalization
measures and the economy is expected to improve as a result of more
raw material exports, especially an improvement in the current
account.  A national conference regime would spend more but would
liberalize the economy.  A military government would limit
liberalization.

CHRONOLOGY:  GUINEA

March 31, 1995      The Interior Ministry announced that the long-
                    delayed parliamentary elections would take place
                    on June 11.

May 16, 1995        A monthly shipping service opened between Conakry
                    and Lagos, Nigeria.

June 2, 1995        Soldiers arrested approximately 100 members of
                    Alpha Conde's RPG party.  The arrests took place
                    in the north, near Mandiana, as RPG supporters
                    headed to a rally.

June 11, 1995       The ruling Party for Unity and Progress captured
                    71 seats in legislative elections, while
                    opposition parties won 38 seats.

June 21, 1995       Employees of six private banks launched a strike
                    for higher wages, training, and better working
                    conditions.

August 9, 1995      Five armed robbers were sentenced to death
                    following a trial of more than 70 people
                    broadcast on national television and radio.

August 28, 1995     President Conte, during a broadcast in his native
                    Soussou language, said there would be no
                    extraparliamentary dialogue with the CODEM
                    alliance of opposition parties.

August 30, 1995     Opposition deputies of the CODEM alliance, formed
                    in July, participated in the installation of the
                    new National Assembly despite a boycott threat.
                    Alpha Conde, however, was absent.

September 15, 1995  Seven Guinea soldiers were killed in Sierra Leone
                    by Sierra Leone rebels.  The deaths were the
                    first in the Guinean deployment.

==============================================================================
BOLIVIA
Tensions are Mounting

The centrist government of President Sanchez de Lozada will face significant
cross-pressures for the remainder of its term.  The successor after the June
1997 elections is likely to be another centrist regime led by someone from
Sanchez de Lozada's National Revolutionary Movement (MNR), but a victory by a
right-wing populist remains a serious risk.  The commitment will continue to
free market policies that call for partial privatization of major state-owned
industries and the reduction of the budget deficit.  However, pressures from
labor and peasants will result in more social spending.  In addition, the large
economic role played by coca leaf dealers will inhibit the strong action
against the drug trade encouraged by the US.  This, in turn, could jeopardize
aid and financial support from the international community.  A right-wing
populist regime led by Carlos Palenque, a radio talk show host who attracts
significant support among the poor, is far from a remote possibility.  It would
raise concerns among investors about increased spending and a reversal of
market reforms.

NEW ZEALAND
National's Challenges Don't Threaten Reform

Prime Minister Jim Bolger and his National Party will have to overcome serious
obstacles in order to remain in power over the next five years.  A new
proportional voting system, which will give smaller parties a larger number of
seats in Parliament, and disarray within the National Party may result in a
coalition government led by either Labour or the Alliance Party, which is an
amalgamation of politicians who have left the two major parties.  Tensions over
immigrants and the rights of the Maori, members of the indigenous population,
could result in limited violence and also a voter backlash against the party in
power.  Despite the expected steady growth and low inflation high unemployment
will remain a problem and little improvement in living standards will be
achieved.  A coalition government led by Labour or Alliance would carry out
more fiscal expansion than would a National government, but unless the most
extreme members of the Alliance dominated policy, would not reverse most of the
market reforms that have been implemented since 1985.

ROMANIA
President Faces Tough Economic Decisions

President Ion Iliescu is favored to win the September 1996 presidential
elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a majority in Parliament.
Despite growing opposition from all sides, Iliescu will dominate the government
as he tries to move the economy toward integration with the EU.  The
privatization program under way will have limited success.  Budget cutting and
market reforms will be implemented enough to qualify for assistance from the
IMF and the EU but not enough to greatly improve the business climate.
However, the economy is expected to grow over the next five years, and
inflation will be brought into more tolerable ranges.

SINGAPORE
Goh to Continue

Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is building support for his leadership of the
ruling People's Action Party (PAP), although former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
remains in a strong position.  Elections that need to be held by August 1996
are likely to result in nothing more than a slight decline in electoral support
for PAP.   The government will manage the economy and will permit some trade
liberalization.  The biggest source of political uncertainty is the successor
to Prime Minister Goh.  The front-runner, Lee Hsien Loong, who is Lee Kuan
Yew's son, suffers from serious health problems.  If he were to become
incapacitated, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan Keng Yam would replace Goh if
there were a transition. The biggest challenge to international business will
continue to be the shortage of labor and the strong position of the Singapore
currency.  Nevertheless, inflation will remain under 4%.

SPAIN
New Government Won't Improve the Economy

Elections in March 1996 are likely to result in a center-right government
headed by Jose Maria Aznar and his Popular Party (PP), depending on support of
one or both of the major regional parties, the Catalonian Convergence and Union
(CiU) and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).  It is possible, but not likely,
that the Socialists could gain the support of these two parties and retain
enough electoral support to head a coalition government.  This likelihood would
increase if someone other than Prime Minister Gonzalez were to lead the party,
and in the process create a united effort.  However, the Socialist Workers
Party (PSOE), which suffers from its long period of rule and several scandals,
is split.  Economic policies are not likely to differ under either government,
as Spain continues to be guided by EU regulations that require liberalization.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
Stability, but Limited Opportunity

The stable federal structure is buttressed by the support of the two dominant
component emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  The federal government will continue
to be led by President Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; the prime
ministership will be held by Sheik Maktum bin Rashid al-Maktum, the current
ruler of Dubai.  If either leader leaves office for reasons of health, he will
be replaced by a younger member of the respective family.  The pressure for
democratic reform is weak.  Islamic fundamentalism will not seriously threaten
the government.  The economy will remain heavily dependent on oil, despite
attempts at diversification.  As a result, growth will be modest, at best, and
inflation will show some upward movement.  Opportunities for foreign business
are expected to be limited, despite some modest attempts to attract foreign
investment through liberalization.

UNITED STATES
No End to Divided Government

The struggle between President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress will almost certainly thwart significant budgetary reform, leading to
economic drift.  The November 1996 presidential and congressional elections are
not likely to affect policy direction, even if the Republican challenger,
probably Sen. Robert Dole, wins the presidency.  The most likely result of the
elections will be a slim victory for Clinton, and Republican control of
Congress.  Popular sentiment for protectionist measures will increase, but is
not likely to be translated into policy.

VENEZUELA
No Improvement in Sight

Sluggish economic growth, high inflation, political vacillation, and outbreaks
of turmoil will assure a bleak climate for international business at least
until the presidential election of 1998.  Even then, the climate will suffer
from underlying structural problems, notably an overdependence on oil exports
and a lack of fiscal discipline.  Poor conditions are aggravated by the
populist stance of President Rafael Caldera Rodriguez.  Caldera will implement
limited austerity measures, but only under pressure from the IMF.  In addition
to his own ideologically-based distaste for such measures, he will be hampered
by opposition in Congress.  He faces an increased risk of political violence or
even a military coup if he accepts the IMF conditions.  Support for leftist
parties, especially Causa R (whose candidate for president, Andres Velasquez,
finished second in 1993), could produce a center-left government in 1998.
Despite its leftist orientation, such a government could implement more
systematic economic reforms than Caldera.  No matter who becomes president,
however, all businesses will suffer from the lack of government legitimacy and
the persistent conflict between the president and Congress.

BRIEF UPDATES TO COUNTRY FORECASTS


BURMA
Glacier-Like Reform

Despite an announced privatization policy and a constitutional convention that
started at the end of November 1995, the military junta is inclined to permit
only the most limited reform.  The military leaders have made it clear that the
constitution must give the military a major role in the new government.  In
response, the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) has threatened to
walk out of the convention.  The NLD is not likely to back down.  More than 80%
of the delegates are appointed by the government, and whatever legislative body
is called for by the constitution will have a large number of delegates
appointed by the military.  Although the government has indicated that it plans
to privatize 51 state-owned companies, only six have been sold.  The government
has put further privatization on hold until a stock exchange is established.
Some of the privatization may include sale of stock to the public, but the
government will maintain control over management.  As a result, investors face
political tension over democratic reforms coming from the US and a government
that will not give up significant control over economic decisions.

CHINA
Business Climate Threatened

Against the background of uncertainty regarding the role of leaders as Deng
Xiaoping's death nears, concern over the future business climate grows.  Jiang
Zemin is consolidating his grip on power but he may actually be merely the
puppet of a small group of top leaders.  There is a clear commitment to foreign
investment and some forms of private enterprise.  However, the struggle between
the regions and the central government is heightened by the weakness in the
center.  State enterprises may be in retreat but they are not likely to close
down because the leadership is worried about the social consequences of
unemployment.  Some discussion has begun within government circles of removing
tax on breaks given to foreign investors to compensate in part for a reduction
in tariffs required for membership in the WTO. This has caused concern within
international business.  Another worry arises from the growing importance and
aggressiveness of the Chinese military, especially in the South China Sea.  In
addition, tensions with Taiwan may increase.  Pressure from the US government
over human rights issues, the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, and trade policy
have already set off a nationalistic response that eventually could threaten
businesses operating in China, including the withdrawal of MFN status by the
US.  As a result, the strong international payments balance may suffer a
decline.

ECUADOR
Investors Worry for Good Reason

Political and economic uncertainties will likely deter investors over the next
year.  President Sixto Duran Ballen is growing increasingly unpopular, because
of a scandal and because of a sluggish economy.  He also faces a badly divided
and hostile congress.  There is little prospect that enough economic reforms
will be implemented to stimulate the economy.  Consequently, the elections in
May 1996 are not likely to result in a regime any more capable of improving the
economy than the current government.  The economy is at risk, because of
increased violence and the threat of a military coup.

EGYPT
Mubarak Consolidates

President Hosni Mubarak has assured his control over the next five years.  He
has cracked down on fundamentalists and in November 1995 engineered a
parliamentary election that increased support for his government. His
willingness to use force, mixed with occasional and limited political
liberalization, has kept the opposition off balance.  He is assured of US
financial help by his support of the Arab-Israeli peace process, although he
manages to postpone implementing the structural economic reforms called for by
the international financial community.  Some progress has been made in reducing
the foreign debt, controlling inflation, and stimulating economic growth.
However, the systematic privatizations that are essemtial to improving
prospects over the long term has yet to develop.  Because of fear that layoffs,
resulting from privatization, could substantially increase social unrest, the
prospects are not good for genuine reform.

IRAN
Weakening Economy

Lacking any consensus on the need for market reforms, and little chance of a
substantial increase in the price of oil, the economy shows no signs of
improving, and inflation continues to be a danger.  President Akbar Hasemi
Rafsanjani has tried to add his supporters to the government, but the more
radical fundamentalists continue to block both market reforms and accommodation
with non-Islamic foreign interests.  At the same time, the US government shows
no signs whatsoever of normalizing economic relations.

OMAN
Dealing With Lower Oil Revenues

Although in firm control, Sultan Qaboos faces serious obstacles in reducing the
country's debt.  The key problem is that the economy depends on oil revenues
which are flat.  The need to develop non-oil exports has been met in part but
not enough to make a palpable difference.  Remittances by foreign workers in
Oman is also a problem that the government will try, probably unsuccessfully,
to address by replacing these workers with Omani nationals.  Qaboos has given
the Consultative Council more visibility, but will resist sharing of power.
Some steps have been promised to increase foreign investment but they have yet
to have much of an impact.

PERU
Fujimori in Firm Control

Despite the defeat of many of the candidates he backed in mid-November 1995
local elections, President Alberto Fujimori shows no signs of losing control.
He stands high in public opinion polls and is not backing down from his
authoritarian rule.  The economy is relatively healthy by South American
standards and significant progress has been made in reducing the huge
international debt that existed when Fujimori first came to power.  Since
Fujimori will be in control until mid-2000, the biggest source of long-term
uncertainty remains the lack of a successor if he were to be assassinated or
leave office for reasons of health.

RUSSIA
Parliamentary Elections Confirm Tensions

The December 1995 parliamentary elections affirmed the chaotic condition of the
political system.  Although the Communist Party received twice as many votes as
the Liberal Democratic party of nationalist extremist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, its
victory was more a result of superior political organization than a yearning
for a return to the Communist system.  Moderates and those in favor of reform
held their own.  Because of the weakness of the Duma in relation to the
presidency, the results will have little direct impact on policy before the
presidential election in June 1996.  The results also suggest that Yeltsin may
have trouble being re-elected if the Communists can unify behind their leader,
Gennadi Zyuganov.  Over the long run, there is little prospect that a
government will emerge that will make significant reforms in the large
state-controlled industries, but most of the market reforms will not be
reversed.  The two biggest sources of risk to the business climate are the lack
of a strong legal framework supporting business operations limiting arbitrary
interventions by the various government bodies and the emergence of a
nationalistic foreign policy that would threaten help from the international
financial community.

SAUDI ARABIA
Isolated Incident no Cause for Concern

The November 1995 bombing of a building in Riyadh used by Americans to train
the Saudi military appears to have been an isolated incident directed more at
the US than at the Saudi government. However, tension remains over both the
presence of US forces in the kingdom and erosion of traditional Muslim values.
There are, nevertheless, no signs that the current government is seriously
threatened.  While the economy remains heavily influenced by oil prices and
levels of production, there has been some diversification.  There has also been
some belt-tightening which has yet to generate significant dissatisfaction with
the government.

TAIWAN
Elections Weaken Ruling Party

Although the ruling Nationalist party won 85 out of 164 seats in the
parliament, it received 45% of the vote, the lowest percentage since 1945.
This resulted in the loss of seven seats.  The biggest winner was the New Party
which gained 21 seats.  Running on a platform of accommodation with China, the
New Party consists primarily of former Nationalist Party (KMT) officials who
left, in part, because of disagreement over the government's apparent move to
an independence position with respect to China.  However, New Party voters were
nearly all mainlanders which, if continued, will limit the party's future vote.
President Lee Teng-hui will encounter more difficulty in implementing new
policy initiatives.  Because the economy is showing the effects of high labor
costs and the tendency of the Taiwanese to invest in China and elsewhere, the
government will be faced with growing electoral dissatisfaction.  President
Lee, however, still enjoys approval ratings in the 70% range.  This makes him a
favorite in the March 1996 presidential election.  If he wins a clear mandate,
he may promote constitutional changes to increase Taiwanese influence in the
government.

ZAMBIA
Chiluba Becomes More Authoritarian

After benefiting from pressures to democratize the political system, President
Frederick Chiluba has chosen his own political survival over democratic
processes.  Because elections are scheduled for October 1996, and because of
the growing political strength of former President Kenneth Kaunda, Chiluba has
tried to eliminate Kaunda over legal technicalities concerning whether or not
the former president is in fact a citizen of Zambia.  Kaunda was arrested twice
in 1995 for failing to receive proper authorization for public speeches.
Chiluba's political problems stem from his inability to revive the economy
despite initial market reforms.  A Kaunda government would likely halt or even
reverse the reforms.

The Anglo-Saxon model for Russia

Foreign direct investment is increasingly taking over from bank 
leverage, as in Germany, or state  influence, as in France and Japan, 
as the desirable means to overhaul an ailing economy or industrial 
sector.  Industries losing out in world competition, such as the UK 
and US car sectors fifteen years ago, are either taken over entirely, 
as in the UK, or respond to the prospect by  restructuring 
themselves, as in the US.  Either way a country finds itself with a 
new modern industry.
The US and the UK, indeed, are not only the world's largest exporters 
of direct capital (with Japan), but by far its largest hosts to such 
investment, accumulating US$400bn in the US and US$200bn in the UK by 
1993.  They have also had the most dynamic economies in the 
capitalist world of late.
The key point is that foreign firms can bring not just capital, but 
fresh management and new ideas of how to produce and market goods and 
what to produce.  Business executives switching jobs around the world 
are better able to discern new global marketing and technical 
opporunities than even the best trained bankers and bureaucrats can 
at home, as Germany and France are finding to their cost. 
The Russians and other FSU economies are peculiarly suitable to host 
multinational enterprise of the sort that began to develop the US and 
Canada (whose railroads and canals were largely built by British 
capital and engineers)  over a century ago.  For they possess scant 
populations, yet abundant raw materials and energy, whose efficient 
exploitation by multinationals has made primary-producing countries, 
such as Australia and Canada, amongst the richest in the world.
The Baltic states and Kazakhstan have already set up fiscal and legal 
regimes highly favourable to foreign investment as well as open stock 
exchanges.  While the former are becoming entrepot port beneficiaries 
of the trade from a resource-rich hinterland, the Kazakhs are in its 
heart, with some 60 per cent of the FSU's mineral reserves, 
attractive to foreign investors.  Japan Chromium Corp., for instance, 
has taken over three Kazakh chrome firms, boosting the sales of two 
of them by 140 per cent over the previous year and profits by 182 per 
cent.  One of them has raised monthly output by 2,000 per cent and 
began selling for hard currency (see page 18). Kazakhstan has 
attracted some US$4bn of the US$100m committed by foreign investors 
in the entire former Soviet zone, including Central Europe.  
Sandwiched between Russia and China, Kazakhstan has geopolitical as 
well as economic reasons to raise its international profile.  But 
Russia itself could only benefit, as already has China, from 
encouraging an inflow of foreign investment to renovate its ossified 
industries.
The cash-strapped military firms striving to convert to civilian 
production and the hard-pressed Russian Space Agency (see Inside 
Track) are doing their utmost to attract foreign capital and custom.  
But the still profitable oil and gas sector, which accounts for over 
US$25bn in hard currency export revenues per annum,is convinced that 
it can overcome its problems on its own.  Its Soviet-trained 
bureaucrats are almost certainly wrong about this, ignorant of the 
extent to which say even the UK; despite BP and Shell, would have 
been unable to develop its sector of the North Sea without the help 
of US firms experienced in Alaska.
Russian Premier, Chernomyrdin, ex-head of Gazprom, has learnt a great 
deal from mixing with his Western counterparts and is pushing for 
foreigners to have a better share in the oil industry, whose present 
managers he, along with many gas managers, holds in low esteem; 
Gazprom, unlike the oil industry, has by and large sustained levels 
of production.  Under his advice, Yeltsin signed a long-awaited law 
on 1st January, allowing foreign oil and gas firms to enter into 
production-sharing agreements with the government.  But the law, 
which allows the government to change tax rates at will and 
unilaterally to re-negotiate a foreign production-sharing agreement, 
does not go far enough to allay the fears of Western energy companies 
and to unlock the multibillion dollar deals that have been on hold 
for years.  The law needs to be amended before they will take the 
plunge.
Behind the reluctance of the oil men in Russia to open up to their 
foreign equivalents is a lingering suspicion that their investment is 
the engine of Western imperialism, as Lenin declared in Imperialism; 
the Last Stage of Capitalism.  They, along with the Duma politicians 
should be sent back to study the history of the US, Canada and 
Australia, resource-rich giants, comparable to Russia, where foreign 
investment was the presiding genius of the first stage of advanced 
capitalism and a chief reason for their pre-eminence today.

ASIAN LINKS: Japan remains Maritime Territory's biggest trading partner

Japan, already by far the biggest trading partner of Russia's Far 
Eastern Maritime Territory, is set to increase its share in the 
Territory's foreign trade turnover even further this year, the 
Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS, reported on 2nd December from 
Vladivostok, quoting the head of the Far Eastern office of Japan's 
Sumitomo Corporation.
The businessman said that in 1994 Japan accounted for 57.2 per cent 
of Maritime Territory's exports and 25.6 per cent of its imports.  
Japan was followed by China with 13.6 per cent of exports and 15.4 
per cent of imports and South Korea with 13 and 16 per cent 
respectively.
Sumitomo Corporation, which co-operates with local companies in the 
Russian Far East in such diverse fields as the timber and coal 
industries, delivery of building equipment, trucks and cars, and the 
laying of telecommunication lines, accounts for over 10 per cent of 
the entire trade turnover between Maritime Territory and Japan.
Korea Tcould open northern Asia to Russian natural gasU
South Korea could play a critical role in opening northern Asian 
energy markets to Russian natural gas exports, according to a new 
study.
A report by ING Barings Bank suggests that Korea, rather than Japan, 
could play the pivotal role in unlocking Russian gas reserves in 
Eastern Siberia.  It says Korea, which is currently seen as one of 
the main targets for liquefied natural gas exports from South-East 
Asian and Middle.  Eastern gas producers, is keen to diversify its 
sources of gas supply.
Any deal involving Korean purchases of Russian gas would have a 
strong regional political dimension, says Mr Alex Stewart, the 
report's author.  Seoul has been keen to improve relations with both 
Russia and China, and a natural gas pipeline to Korea via the latter 
would be a potent political symbol of regional co-operation.
The study says Japan's hopes to tap gas from fields of the Russian 
island of Sakhalin remain frustrated because of continuing 
uncertainly over the fate of production-sharing legislation in 
Moscow.  It says the 'lingering territorial dispute with Russia over 
the Kurile islands' is an added impediment.
Mr Stewart said Korean companies had undertaken detailed studies to 
determine the viability of projects based on gas from Eastern Russia.  
But any announcement of further progress might be affected by the 
political scandals that have recently embroiled the Seoul government.

AVIATION - Russia sets up air market protection commission

The Russian government is to set up a special commission to look at 
ways of protecting Russia's traditional markets in aircraft 
construction and air transport, Interfax news agency reported on 5th 
December.  The commission is to be headed by the chairman of the CIS 
(Commonwealth of Independent States) Interstate Aviation Committee, 
Tatyana Anodina.
Interfax quoted the head of the Russian Transport Ministry's Air 
Transport Department, Vadim Zamotin, as saying that lack of airline 
purchasing power has led to a situation where domestic manufacturers 
of aircraft and spares are at a standstill or are cutting back 
production.  He said the domestic market had a requirement of 1,250 
aeroplanes and helicopters by the year 2000, by which time passenger 
air movements will have doubled to 51m a year.
There are currently 418 air companies operating in Russia, but 37 per 
cent of them account for 80 per cent of all air movements.
Moscow airports to meet international standards by year 2000
The Russian Transport Ministry and the Moscow city government have 
drawn up a comprehensive reconstruction programme designed to turn 
the Russian capital's airports into a major world transport centre by 
the year 2000, Moscow 2x2 TV has reported.
At the first stage of the programme, which is to be carried out over 
the next two years at an estimated cost of at least R1,176bn, 
runways, freight and passenger terminals and technical equipment at 
Moscow's four airports are to be brought up to international 
standards.  At the next stage, a convenient system for getting air 
passengers quickly to and from the city and between airports is to be 
introduced, 2x2 said.
The television station quoted Vadim Zamotin, director of the Russian 
Transport Ministry's Air Transport Department, as saying that at 
present Moscow's airports did not meet either international or 
domestic standards on a number of counts, including safety 
provisions.

ENERGY -First 11 months see shift to West in oil and gas exports

Russia exported more than 112.9m tonnes of oil worth around US$11.2bn 
in the first 11 months of last year, Interfax news agency reported, 
quoting State Statistics Committee figures, on 15th December.
The amount sold fell by 3.3 per cent by comparison with the same 
period in 1994 but the price per tonne of oil rose 12 per cent to 
average US$99.80.  Of the 11-month oil-export total, 87.8m tonnes 
went to countries outside the former Soviet Union, an increase of 2.6 
per cent on 1994.  During the same period, exports to members to the 
CIS and to the Baltic States were 19.5 per cent down on last year, at 
25m tonnes.
In November alone, Russia exported 7.2m tonnes of oil to countries 
outside the former Soviet Union and 3.9m tonnes of oil to the former 
union republics.
Exports of natural gas rose 2.5 per cent year on year during the 
period under review, with Russia exporting 173bn cubic metres, worth 
a total of US$12.1bn.  Countries outside the former Soviet Union 
received 109.9bn cubic metres of gas, a 10.5 per cent rise in 
January-November 1994.  The CIS and Baltic States received 63bn cubic 
metres, down 9.1 per cent on last year.  In November, Europe received 
11.1bn cubic metres of Russian gas and the CIS and Baltic states 
8.6bn cubic metres.
Russia's exports of petroleum products amounted to 43.9m tonnes in 
January-November, about the same as last year.  Of that total, 
countries outside the former Soviet Union received 40.6m tonnes, 11.8 
per cent up on last year's figure, and the CIS and Baltics received 
3.2m tonnes, less than half the figure for 1994.

European fashion exhibition for Russia, the CIS and the Baltic 
states, 28th February to 2nd March 1996.  They expect 150 to 200 
companies from all over the world, of which approximately 10 per cent 
are going to be from the US, will participate in the show.
ITE, the largest and most successful exhibition organiser in Russia 
and the CIS, has a complete Russian database of fashion buyers, 
maintains personal contacts in many of the principal trading 
companies, and has ready access to all Russian trade associations.

the Moscow International Travel & Tourism Show (912 exhibitors, 
92,000 visitors), Moscow International Motor Show (300 exhibitors, 
500,000 visitors), Moscow International Sport & Leisure Show (225 
exhibitors, 15,000 visitors), and Moscow International Healthcare 
Exhibition (200 exhibitors,40,000 visitors).  
Bleinheim is a leading exhibition company in Europe, with 250 trade 
shows worldwide.  It is the organiser of premier collections in the 
United Kingdom with 1,200 exhibitors from 26 countries and Mode 
Infantile in France with 250 exhibitors.  The company has well-
established relations with major clothing producers in Russia and 
worldwide. GIMA is the fastest growing exhibition organiser in 
Germany specialising in the Russian market, having substantial

Moscow, offering excellent entertainment and sightseeing, providing 
easy access to visitors.  
Manezh international exhibition hall is the perfect location for a 
fashion exhibition located close to Moscow fashion boutiques, 
clothing shops and department stores.  Novy Arbat and Tverskaya

companies will be able to establish direct links and  an 
infrastructure that will lead to effective sales throughout Russia.
Russian apparel manufacturing has declined by 55 per cent since 1992, 
causing significant shortages of clothing.  Although much of this 
demand has been filled by US$2bn of imports annually, there is still 
unfulfilled demand for Western styles and medium to high quality 
products.

PRECIOUS METALS - Russia plans jewels exchange

Russian authorities will launch an exchange in January for uncut and 
polished diamonds, according to the head of the Russian association 
of diamond producers, the Interfax news agency reported.
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is under consideration as a possible 
co-founder, Ararat Evoyan said, with other likely co-founders being 
the Finance Ministry and the State Committee on Precious Metals.
De Beers and the Russian diamond factory adjourned talks without 
agreement.  The discussions will resume in early January, De Beers 
said in a statement released in London.
The company said the parties had agreed to extend the five-year sales 
agreement between Russia and De Beers until 1st February.  Buoyed by 
the comments from both sides, analysts expressed optimism that De 
Beers and Russia would reach a marketing agreement, but many said 
negotiations would probably drag on past 1st February.
James Allen of the stock brokerage concern, Anderson Wilson, said 
that the extension was positive, demonstrating that neither side 
wanted to walk away from a deal.
"I would personally expect the contract to be extended again before 
they reach a final agreement," he said.
Under the current deal, Russia sells 95 per cent of its rough gems 
through De Beers's Central Selling Organisation.
Russia has argued that it should be allowed to sell more stones 
independently.

Yeltsin lifts export duties on petroleum and timber products

Aleksandr Livshits, economic aide to President Yeltsin, confirmed 
that from 1st December export duties levied on most petroleum and 
timber products would be lifted and numerous other duties halved, 
Interfax news agency reported on 20th November.
Speaking at a briefing in the Kremlin on 30th November, Livshits said 
that the president had signed a decree to that effect.
The decree also imposes a ceiling on the prices of products sold by 
"natural monopolists" during the first six months of 1996.  The price 
rise will not exceed the monthly inflation rate, which is 
continuously falling, Livshits said, adding that the president had 
also issued an order for a programme of state support for exporters 
to be drawn up before 15th December.  The president was said to be 
concerned over non-raw material exports from Russia.  Livshits said 
he expected the structures of exports to change as a result of the 
decree.

Russia to usher in trading in precious metals and stones

The Russian government has adopted a resolution which takes the 
country nearer to a deregulated market in precious metals and stones, 
Interfax news agency reported on 1st December, quoting the Union of 
Russian Prospectors.
The Committee for Precious Metals and Stones and the Central Bank 
will have priority access to government-determined quotas of precious 
metals and stones, and prospectors will sell the remainder to 
authorised banks.  Under the government resolution, private 
individuals may then purchase and trade gold, silver and plutonium 
ingots and gemstones, mainly through exchange dealings.
The rules governing exchange dealings are to be submitted by the 
Finance Ministry, Committee for Precious Metals and Stones and 
Central Bank within a month, with a view to trading starting up in 
the first quarter of 1996.
In addition, the Committee for Precious Metals and Stones is to issue 
certified ingots of gold, silver and plutonium, weighing between one 
and 500g.
In a further move, the government has also permitted authorised banks 
to take gold and silver ingots abroad for security operations to 
attract foreign loans.

ships from January 1996 following a decision by the Russian Federal 
Border Service to allow vessels under foreign flags to call at its 
port, Interfax news agency reported on 12th December.
Dalzavod, described as the biggest shipyard in the Russian Far East, 
will continue ship-building operations given that it has a new modern 
loading facility allowing it to compete with other ports in the area.
Servicing foreign ships could erase Dalzabvod's acute financial 
problems which have been caused by the Russian government's failure

TRANSPORT - St Petersburg port goes ahead with upgrade plans

The St Petersburg Seaport is to press ahead with plans for expansion 
despite financial losses this year of between R20bn and R25bn, 
Interfax news agency reported on 10th December, quoting the general 
director of the port, Anatoliy Bilichenko.
Bilichenko attributed this year's losses to poor tax, customs and 
privatisation laws and said expansion would be carried out without 
government help.  Interfax said that the port had still to receive 
tax  concessions promised by St Petersburg mayor, Anatoliy Sobchak.
Bilichenko said that in 1996 the port would use its own money and 
investment from partners to continue the construction of a terminal 
with a final capacity of 150,000 containers a year.  It is also 
designing a terminal to handle 1m tonnes of sugar a year.  Bilichenko 
put the cost of the entire complex at between US$50m and US$55m.  He 
said that capacity at the port was expected to increase by 2m tonnes 
to 11m tonnes in 1996.

BATLIC STATES - Estonia signs up to join EU

Estonia, which was part of the Soviet Union only four years ago, 
could qualify to join the single European currency in two year's 
time.  The Estonian government, which formally applied to join the 
European Union in Brussels on 4th December, has told EU countries 
that it has gone a long way to meeting the stringent single-currency 
conditions set out in the Maastricht Treaty.
Speaking to a news conference in Brussels, the foreign minister, Siim 
Kallas, said his country was unusual in the Baltic region in having 
achieved a balanced budget and having its currency, the kroon, tied 
by law to the value of the Deutschmark.  "Estonia has no budget 
deficit, we have achieved a remarkably rapid growth and our inflation 
is falling very rapidly indeed," he said.  "On present trends we 
could meet all the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty for joining 
the single currency in two years' time."
Estonia is the fifth former Eastern bloc country to apply for EU 
membership, joining Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Latvia.  
Applications from the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia and the 
Czech Republic are expected in the next few weeks.  Both are judged 
by the EU as economically successful and possible candidates for the 
single currency.
Negotiations to enlarge the EU will not begin until the conclusion of 
the conference to review the Maastricht Treaty, which begins next 
year.  Although it may not end until 1997, there is growing pressure 
in the EU for accession negotiations to start by the beginning of 
1998, which would make it possible for some countries to join by the 
year 2000.
EU governments are worried about Russia's reaction to their accepting 
the Baltic states into full membership. But although Moscow has 
warned of a crisis if Nato accepted the Baltic states, it has made no 
such threat about EU enlargement.
"Our policy on security is very clear: Estonia wants to join Nato and 
our other security commitments in Europe will follow on that 
development," Mr Kallas said.  Estonian officials insist that Russian 
fears about their integration in Western Europe are exaggerated.
EU leaders have to decide when to begin negotiations on enlargement, 
how quickly they can be concluded and at what cost.  The likely 
outcome is an agreement to start talks no later than six months after 
the conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty review conference.  
Negotiations will be held with about 10 countries from central and 
eastern Europe.
Estonian parliament fails to approve central bank's annual report
The Riigikogu parliament on 7th December failed to endorse the Bank 
of Estonia's 1994 financial report.  Instead, it suspended the draft 
resolution's passage because of the loss of 170m kroons (US$13) on 
the bank's books.  Finance Commission chairman, Olev Raju, said that 
the Riigikogu cannot endorse the central bank's report as it stands 
because this would be in conflict with the laws.  
Under a law regulating the Bank of Estonia, the Riigikogu must 
endorse the bank's annual report every year, including its balance 
sheet and revenue and expense accounts.  The balance must also show 
any losses as well as the method of making up for them and sources 
for this.

BATLIC STATES - Lithuania approves privatisation programme

The Lithuanian cabinet has endorsed the country's privatisation 
strategy for the next five years, Lithuanian Radio reported on 6th 
December.
Under the second stage of privatisation, set to begin in early 1996, 
shares will be available for cash only, not vouchers.  The value of 
unsold state capital after the first stage of privatisation stands at 
about 7.5-8bn litas (US$1.9-2bn) and property worth 2bn litas could 
be disposed of by the year 2000, with priority being given to 
enterprises already earmarked for privatisation under the first phase 
of sell-offs.
"The government pledges not to sell property hastily or give it out.  
The main criteria will be economic and social results.  The Cabinet 
of Ministers will aspire to legalise privatisation of land not for 
agricultural use. Corporate bodies would be able to purchase the land 
together with other property," the radio station said.
The government has also pledged not to sell off strategic 
installations whose privatisation parliament has opposed.  These are 
mainly power engineering, transport and communications facilities.  
The government is also to take steps to encourage share dealing on 
the stock exchange.

GEORGIA - Georgia gets German loan to develop power engineering, agriculture

The German government has granted Georgia a long-term loan of DM50m 
(US$36m), the Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS reported from Tbilisi on 
27th November, quoting sources at the German embassy.
Of this amount, DM40m is earmarked for the development of the 
country's power engineering sector and 10m for agriculture.  The loan 
is for 40 years, with the first 10 years interest-free.  Georgia is 
to start repaying the loan in 10 years.
Georgia to extract gas from newly-found deposit in Tbilisi
Georgia is to start commercial exploitation of a natural gas deposit 
found in Tbilisi by a team of Georgian and Swiss geologists, the 
Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS, reported from the Georgian capital on 
2nd December.
Gas extraction from the deposit in Tbilisi's Varketili district is to 
begin in January 1996 and initial yield is expected to be 300 cu.m. a 
day, adding that this amount would provide enough natural gas for 
Tbilisi's industrial enterprises during the winter period.  From May 
1996, when extraction is expected to increase, some gas will also be 
supplied to household consumers in Tbilisi.
Georgia currently buys natural gas from Turkmenistan, Russia and 
other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, adding 
that in the past two years household and industrial consumers in 
Georgia had experienced great shortages in gas supplies.

RUSSIA - Moscow pledges tough line on economy

Russia's economics ministry has pledged it would continue to pursue a 
harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and cut the 
monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent, despite the strong 
anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary elections.
However, the ministry's tough stance, continued in an annual economic 
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the softer rhetoric employed by 
President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's 
Eve.
"The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who are poor should 
begin to live better," he said, promising the government would 
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has 
caused great social distress.
Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in finanical circles 
which was responsible for diverting money intended for social 
spending.
Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing rhetoric 
reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce "saboteurs" who were 
responsible for undermining the reform programme.
He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them 
for savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.
Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the 
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up 
inflation early this year.  The government may come under intense 
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral 
favour before the presidential election in June.
But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradication 
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.
Russia confirmed that it had missed the New Year deadline for 
destroying thousands of tanks and other military hardware beyond the 
Ural Mountains and said Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan had 
also failed to meet the treaty commitment, Reuter reports from  
Moscow.
General Dmitry Kharchenko said Moscow wanted to push the 31st 
December 1995 deadline pledged by the Soviet Union in 1991 back to 
the end of 1998.  The pledge had cleared the way for ratification of 
the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.

Economy at year-end

In comparison with the same period last year, Russia's Gross Domestic 
Product has declined by 3 per cent and industrial performance by 2 
per cent.  As before, agriculture is still in dire straits: the 
decline in gross farming output was 12 per cent, or 3 per cent 
higher.  Inflation, which was 18 per cent in January, subsided to 4.9 
per cent by early November, which might be viewed as a success but 
for the fact that it was artificially held back.  Specifically, 
inflation dynamics have been affected by international compression of 
the money supply - wage defaults and belated inflationary 
compensations; payment defaults by the state and by enterprises for 
work performed, orders filled and products supplied.  No growth in 
production as the basis for financial stabilsiation was observed, 
although certain sectors, such as steel and chemical production, are 
showing signs of recovery, reports ECONews.
The social situation is such that real incomes of the population have 
slipped by another 12 per cent.  Debts in the payment of wages by the 
state and enterprises now total over 8 trillion roubles (US$1.8bn), 
or 12 per cent more than last year.  The decreasing standard of 
living of the population, the slump in the caloric value and 
nutritiional balance of the Russians' diet and other factors have led 
to the present lower birth and higher mortality rates.  The size of 
the country's population may fall by over 1 million this year.  
Unemployment has risen sizeably: according to the International 
Labour Organisation, it is 7.8 per cent of the employable population 
(approximately 5.7m people); the Federal Employment Service has 
officially registered 2.8 million jobless on the dole.  The 
superfluous manpower potential is estimated to rise to 10 per cent or 
more (9 to 10 million people) in the near future.

RUSSIA - Coke aims to double Russian investment

Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drinks producer, is planning to 
double its investment in Russia to US$500m by the end of 1997.  The 
US group is seeking to wrest market leadership in Russia from 
PepsiCo, its rival which established a strong presence in the former 
Soviet Union through a series of barter deals during the communist 
era.
Coca-Cola began to invest heavily in central and Eastern Europe 
following the collapse of communism and, along with its bottling 
partners, is planning to spend about US$2bn in the region by the end 
of 1997.
Mr Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola president and chief operating officer, 
said the group was rapidly closing the gap on PepsiCo in Russia.  
Coca-Cola sales almost tripled in Moscow last year and overall in 
Russia had doubled in 1994.  It had quadrupled its sales volume in 
the country since it began to invest in 1991.  The group was being 
out-sold by PepsiCo by a margin of 4 to 1 in Russia two years ago, 
but the gap had fallen this year to less than 2 to 1, and Mr Ivester 
said that the "margin is now near parity."
Coca-Cola has opened a US$40m plant in St Petersburg to serve a 
market of more than 9m people in North-Western Russia.  On 1st 
December, it opened the extension of its US$65m plant in Moscow, 
where it has more than doubled capacity since it opened in April last 
year.
The US$500m investment in Russia is being made by Coca-Cola, along 
with some of its international bottling partners including Inchcape, 
the UK trading group, the Anadolu group of Turkey, and Leventis, 
which already has Coca-Cola bottling plants elsewhere, including 
Greece, Nigeria, Ireland, Bulgaria and Romania.  
In late November, Coca-Cola opened a regional office in Istanbul, as 
a springboard for expansion into Central Asia, where it is planning 
to invest more than US$100m in the next two years.  Anadolu, Turkey's 
largest brewer, has the Coca-Cola bottling rights for Turkmenistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and parts of Southern Russia.
Inchape announced in September that it was doubling its investment in 
Coca-Cola bottling plants in Russia to US$80m by the end of 1997.
The Coca-Cola system now has a workforce of more than 3,000 in 
Russia, and the US group claims that it supports a further 30,000 
jobs indirectly in local suppliers and services.  It sources locally 
around 70 per cent of the supplies and services needed for the 
production and marketing of its products in Russia.
Having trailed PepsiCo in Eastern Europe during the communist era, 
Coca-Cola claims that it now outsells its rival by 2 to 1 throughout 
the region.

RUSSIA - Daily bread

Today in Russia a loaf of bread costs twice as much as it did a year 
before.  Tomorrow it may cost even more, certain experts forecast, 
reports ECONews.
Their predictions are based on this year's extremely low harvest of 
grain, primarily wheat.  Twenty three per cent less of it has been 
harvested in hopper weight.  The explanations for the lean harvest 
include unfavourable weather, the general farming crisis and 
inadequate financial support from the state.
Public pronouncements that Russia will not import grain any more are 
now being corrected.  Grains (primarily food) will have to be 
imported because, in addition to crop failure, the main Russian 
producers - Kuban and the Stavropol Territory - have gathered in 
disease-stricken wheat which is unfit for baking good bread.  
For this reason Russia's bread-basket, the Don region, has to buy 
wheat abroad, particularly from Hungary, with which it has signed an 
agreement.  In all, 50,000 tonnes of American wheat will be supplied 
to the Voronezh Region, which has also signed a wheat agreement. 
To carry over till next harvest Russia needs at least 10 to 12 
million tonnes of imported grains, mostly food.  Owing to the 
unfavourable situation on the world grain market, the price of grain 
is fluctuating between US$200 and 400 per tonne.

RUSSIA - Problems of comparatively prosperous sectors

One of the most well-off sectors of Russia's economy, the oil 
industry, has of late been facing the same problems as other sectors 
- production fall, default, lack of resources for settlements with 
the budget and wage settlements.  Over nine months the production of 
oil has declined by 4 per cent due to a 6 per cent drop in 
development drilling; the installation of new wells has decreased by 
11 per cent, reports ECONews.
Experts from the Oil and Gas Industrialists' Union are of the same 
mind, though they look deeper into the situation:  "The lack of a 
nominal pricing policy in general, and particularly regarding fuel 
and energy resources; the failure of debtors to pay for fuel 
supplies, including those to CIS countries; the default crisis and 
the tough tax pressures - all this leads, and has already led, to the 
fall of oil production in Russia.  Today tax repayments take more 
than 70 per cent of the profits of oilmen and up to 75 per cent of 
those of gas producers.  Over one-third of the nation's oil wells are 
currently idle, and more than half of all hardware components have 
substantially deteriorated."
Looking into possible sources of financing for the 1996 budget 
deficit, oil and gas industrialists note that much weight has been 
given to receipts from monetary privatisation, above all the 
auctioning of state-held controlling blocks of shares of enterprises 
which are still afloat, including some in the oil and gas complexes.
It is intriguing that the fall in the production of oil and the 
general crisis in the sector are taking place against the background 
of increasing exports of crude oil and products of oil refining.  So 
far, specialists cannot say what the abolition of export taxes and 
quotas of oil and oil products will mean for Russia.  Additional 
billions of dollars for exporters are involved and no-one knows where 
they will end up.

RUSSIA - Sakhalin oilmen lay 7-km underwater pipeline and boost oil extraction

A 7-km underwater oil pipeline has been laid linking Sakhalin Island 
to mainland Russia, Russian Public TV has reported. 
The pipeline, under the Tatarskiy Proliv strait, is the third stage 
of a link between the oil town of Okha, in northern Sakhalin, and the 
town of Komsomolsk-na-Amure on the far Eastern mainland.  The 
underwater section was laid by a team from the 
Sakhalinmorneftemontazh, or Sakhalin offshore oil assembly, company 
and a floating crane from the far Eastern port of Nakhodka.
Oil and gas extraction on Sakhalin are up 13 per cent on last year's 
figures, despite a devastating earthquake in May which damaged over 
500km of main pipeline, power transmission lines, roads, railways and 
dozens of oil and gas wells, to a total cost of R652bn.  Following 
the earthquake, Sakhalin oil companies were permitted to sell 500,000 
tonnes of crude oil abroad free of export duty in order to finance 
reconstruction.

RUSSIA - Many Russian oilfields have high water conten

Experts of the Infotek financial company have concluded that 
currently Russia's recovered oil deposits are flooded by 71.54 per 
cent on average, having analysed data on producing oil fields 
presented by 30 of the largest oil companies in Russia.
The water content in the recovered liquid is the most important 
characteristic of the recovered deposit.  At the beginning of the 
development, oil is almost pure.  As the oil content decreases with 
further extraction, the water content increases both during the use 
of correct and incorrect technology.  As a rule, when the water 
content exceeds 90 per cent, the deposit becomes unprofitable. This 
signifies the beginning of the deposit's end.
Nizhevartovskneftegaz's (nearly 94 per cent) and Bashneft's (over 92 
per cent) fields have the highest water content.  Another nine of 
Russia's largest oil companies are on the verge with 80 per cent 
water content, such as Kondpetroleum, Meginneftegaz, Sakhalin-
morneftegaz, and Tatneft.

RUSSIA - Kabardino-Balkaria becomes oil republic

Russia's southern constituent republic of Kabardino-Balkaria has 
begun commercial production of oil, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 
1st December.
Quoting a republican government source, the agency said an oil well 
which it named as Kharbizhenskaya had "excellent" prospects and that 
Kabardino-Balkaria "is becoming an oil producing republic."
Initially oil will be carried by tankers for refining in neighbouring 
Ingushetia.  Later, refining equipment, paid for out of federal 
funds, is to be imported from abroad for assembly in the republic.
Groznyy oil refinery covering most of Chechnya's fuel requirements
The Groznyy oil refinery is currently producing 1,500 tonnes of 
petroleum products a day, oil refinery director, Ramzan Zakayev, told 
Interfax on 11th November.  After the restoration operation is 
completed next year the oil refinery will be capable of annually
producing about 10m tonnes of petroleum products, Zakayev said.
The Groznyy oil refinery nearly fully meets Chechnya's needs in 
kerosene, diesel fuel and fuel oil, he said.  After the restoration 
operation is completed, the oil refinery will also meet Chechnya's 
need in high-octance petrol, Zakayev said.
The Groznyy oil refinery's performance was suspended in December 1994 
after military actions were launched in Chechnya.  The oil refinery 
resumed work several months ago, Zakayev said.  
Oil storages were almost fully destroyed and equipment from pump 
stations was stolen during the military actions, Zakayev told 
Interfax..
Zakayev said 7,500 employees were currently working at the oil 
refinery, or 1,000 people fewer than before the armed conflict.  He 
said about 3,000 employees had to take forced leave because the 
restoration operation had not so far been completed.  
Zakayev said the average wage at the oil refinery was about R500,000, 
reports Interfax.  
With regard to wage arrears, Zakayev said the debt on wages for the 
last year and seven months of 1995 had been paid off with the 
assistance from the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry and the state 
commission for rebuilding the Chechen economy, led by Russian First 
Deputy Prime Minister, Oleg Soskovets.

RUSSIA - Power industry

According to the forecasts made by experts of the industry, the 
aggregate capacity of the Russian power plants will amount to about 
200 gigawatts by the year 2000, a decrease of 12 gigawatts compared 
to the present level, reports ECONews.
The exhaustion of the service life of many thermal power plants, 
which now account for 70 per cent of the total output of electricity, 
and meet nearly half of the country's requirements for heat, is the 
root cause of the expected drop.  To prevent such a decline, it is 
necessary to put annually into operation facilities able to generate 
8-9 gigawatts of electricity, in order to compensate for the closure 
of worn-out ones.  It is noteworthy that, despite the decline, the 
sector remains a major exporter of electricity, supplying up to 
twenty billion kilowatt-hours per annum to Western Europe alone.

RUSSIA - Coal industry

If nothing unforeseen happens, the coal industry should become 
profitable within the next five-seven years.  This forecast was made 
by general director of the Rosugol state company, Yuri Malyshev.  The 
progressive movement in this direction has been achieved through the 
shut-down of the loss-making coal mines - 34 collieries have ceased 
to exist over the past eighteen months, reports ECONews.
The wage-payment arrears, which now total nearly one-trillon roubles, 
are the most pressing problem in the industry at the present time.  
Approximately 70 per cent of them stem from non-payments by coal 
consumers, and 30 per cent from sluggish federal budget financing. 
During the past three months alone, the deficit of the budget 
financing of the coal sector reached 116 trillion roubles.
The government views regional and inter-regional mutual settlements, 
as well as the introduction of a market mechanism for charging 
overdue debts towards debtors' property, as a way to resolve the non-
payments problem.  Such tough sanctions will not affect enterprises 
of the munitions industry and higher education establishments. 
Vladimir Gusev, the chairman of the State Duma committee for 
industry, construction, transport and energy, believes that the "coal 
crisis" can be ended through immediate payment of the federal debts 
to the coal workers.  This can be done by working out and fulfilling 
a state programme of restructuring the industry, with due account 
taken of the specific economic and social features of the country's 
coal fields, and by ensuring the spending of the subsidies from the 
federal budget mainly on the development of production, restructuring 
of enterprises, and material support to miners who lose their jobs as 
a result of the shut-down of coal production units.
Russia expected to produce 122 tonnes of gold in 1995
Russia is expected to extract 122 tonnes of gold by the end of 1995, 
down from 131  last year, Interfax news agency reported on 29th 
November, quoting an unnamed official from the Russian Federation 
Committee for Precious Metals and Stones.
The official said the country's total gold production for 1995, 
including gold obtained from mine tailings and waste, could reach 
129t, compared with 142.6t in 1994.  Up to November, gold-extracting 
enterprises have produced over 100t.
The committee official was also quoted as saying advance payments to 
gold-producing enterprises, which were due to begin in November, had 
to be postponed after the president ordered the government to sell 
part of Russia's gold reserves to pay pensions.  He said, however, 
that the money was coming "in the very near future."  Gold producers 
are expected to receive in prepayments 25 per cent of the value of 
their 130t quota for 1996.  Those operating "in particularly hard 
conditions" could get as much as 50 per cent, compared with 35 per 
cent in 1995.

About 12 tonnes of gold have been produced by the mines in Amur 
Region in the Russian Far East since the beginning of the year, 
Interfax news agency reported from the regional capital, 
Blagoveshchensk, on 4th December.

saying, Amur Region was Russia's third-largest gold producer, behind 
Yakutia, and Magadan Region.  The Russian government is currently 
considering extending a credit to the Region to develop the 
Pokrovskoy gold mine and began jewellery production in co-operation 
with Italian and Indian companies.

RUSSIA - Privatisation: Facts and Figures

The share of the private (privatised) sector of the Russian economy 
in the creation of the Gross Domestic Product of the Russian 
Federation has exceeded the share of the state sector, and keeps 
growing steadily.  The income from the privatisation stage of 1992, 
amounted to 56.2bn roubles (14.6bn were transferred to the federal 
budget); in 1993, some 355bn was earned (71.1bn); in 1994, 984bn 
(117.4bn); and in 1995 the total income from the privatisation is 
expected to be around 24 trillion roubles (US$4.8bn), of which 9.3 
per cent are destined for the national treasury.  As of 1st October 
1995, a mere 162bn roubles had been received.  
A sum total of revenues from privatisation, amounting to 11.4 
trillion roubles, has been included in calculations for the draft 
budget for 1996, reports ECONews.
According to the calculations by the Institute for Economic Analysis, 
the nominal income from privatisation, taking the inflation index 
into account, i.e, its real value, has dropped by 34 per cent, and 
the federal budget revenues by 49 per cent as against 1992.  The 
figures were down by 13 and 48 per cent respectively in 1994 
(compared to the previous year), and this trend is expected to 
persist in 1995.  Approximately 20 per cent of all receipts are spent 
on financing the privatisation process itself, and on the maintenance 
of the agencies which carry it out.
Of the enterprises privatised in 1995, 38 per cent were in the 
industrial sector, 18 in construction, 11 in trade, 6.2 in transport, 
and 4.5 per cent in science; 34 per cent of the 279 million shares 
issued in the country of "privatisation-95," were bought by the 
personnel of those enterprises, and 6 per cent were sold to trust and 
holding companies.  
Approximately 84m shares were sold on the free market, and 40m of 
them have not been sold yet.  The controlling blocks of shares, owned 
by the state, comprises 67m shares with a nominal value of 51.3bn 
roubles.

UKRAINE - Social pressures prevent closure of Ukraine's inefficient coal mines

Ukraine's coal production will be down another 11.1 per cent this 
year at 83.9m tonnes, according to the latest government estimate.  
The continuing slide - from 179m tonnes in 1990 - will force the once 
mighty coal producer to raise imports next year to 20m tonnes at an 
estimated cost of US$500m, the Kiev parliament's budget committee 
chairman has announced.  Russia and Poland are to supply the bulk of 
the coal, as in the past two years.
However, Ukraine also plans to export 3m tonnes of coal next year, 
mostly to Western countries, which pay with much-needed hard 
currency.  Imports are usually paid for by barter and domestic prices 
are regulated.  The country imported an estimated 12.3m tonnes in the 
first nine months of this year and exported 1.7m tonnes, worth 
US$51m.
Exhausted pits and antiquated technology are at the root of the 
crisis in the mining sector, which mirrors the broader economic 
downturn in Ukraine.
The government this year cut all support, after propping up 
inefficient producers with monthly US$50m subsidies in 1994.
But the cabinet's decision in May to close 15 pits and a coal mining 
strip by the new year - emergency measures designed to push ahead 
economic reform - was not backed by the necessary political will.  Mr 
Oleksandr Kolosok, spokesman for the coal ministry, has said the 
closure had been indefinitely postponed.  "The main problem is 
people: the mines can't be closed because entire towns completely 
depend on them," he said.  RIf you close the mine, everyone will be 
left without jobs or support.  The young can find other work but what 
about the older pensioners?"
He added that the government lacked funding to close the mines 
properly, and continuing to operate them was cheaper.  The World Bank 
is considering a loan of up to US$80m to cover all closure costs.
All the 257 mines remain open.  But with wages falling and often left 
unpaid, the number of miners this year fell 9.3 per cent to 426,017, 
down from 529,000 in 1992, according to coal ministry statistics.

The political fear centres around labour unrest and unemployment, 
which could destabilise the government.  In December, Kiev agreed to 
pay US$270m in back pay - a potentially inflation-stoking settlement 
- after a large walkout in the coal-rich eastern Donbass region.  
Most Ukrainians live in the eastern regions, which spent the longest 
time under communism and may be most open to Russian revanchism.
Some miners support closures to concentrate resources in the better 
pits and compete with Russian mines, where many Ukrainians now work.  
But Mr Kolosok argued that Ukraine could not compete with Russia, 
whose mines are mechanised and more efficient.
The mining sector also has been hurt by the government's reluctance 
to liberalise domestic energy prices.  In a recent interview, Mr 
Evhen Marchuk, Ukraine's prime minister, said household tariffs, now 
at 60 per cent cost recovery, will cover 80 per cent next year and 
full cost by 1997.  He added full liberalisation, expected by the new 
year, had to be postponed.  Industrial users are charged the market 
price, but payment discipline among the largely unprofitable state 
sector remains poor.
As the government slows painful restructuring the mines are taking a 
heavy environmental and health toll.  The pits contribute 3 per cent 
of the world's emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas associated with 
global warming.
Gas de France, Charbonnages de France, and Hunosa, a Spanish coal 
mining company, this year started to look at developing coal gas 
methane in a project funded by the European Union.  But the gas is 
not trapped and sold at present.
In December, two miners died in separate accidents in Donetsk, the 
capital of the Donbass region.  By this year, the fatality rate among 
Ukrainian miners rose to five per 1m tonnes of coal produced, the 
highest in the world, according to Mr Kolosok.

UKRAINE - Opportunity knocks for Kiev

Imagine a capital city in Europe where there is such a storage of 
office space that embassies are run from hotels rooms and 
multinational subsidiaries work from suburban houses.  That city is 
Kiev, capital of Ukraine. which is one of the largest countries in 
Europe.
Property consultant, Aldon Ferguson, believes opportunities in Kiev 
are enormous "since there are hardly any quality office buildings and 
only one good hotel: the 25-room Domus, refurbished by an Italian 
company"S
More foreign companies are opening up in the city, joining the 
growing list of blue chip concerns that include Philip Morris, 
Motorola, Siemens and large,  international accountancy practices.  
Ferguson, who pioneered Western property consultancies in Moscow and 
St Petersburg before selling out to DTZ Debenham Zadelhoff, said:  
"Kiev is the capital of a large country and will need to build all 
the facilities that suit that position"S
Canadians are further down the road than most in investing in Kiev 
because of a large expatriate Ukrainian population in their country, 
although Austrian and Dutch banks are also ready to put money into 
the city; but as with anywhere else in the former communist bloc, the 
route to successful investing is strewn with pitfalls, not least by 
the conflicting views of the local authority and national government 
in Kiev.
The result is that although Western companies are desperate for 
accommodation, they are reluctant to own buildings, a difficult 
enough task in any case.  A developer, or occupier, needs a 
refurbishment certificate to obtain a 49-year lease which is 
automatically renewable.
Ferguson calculates that a developer would need to spend US$2,000 a 
square metre on buying an interest and refurbishing it to a high 
standard.
An example of the potential for developers is that refurbishing a 1-
000 square metre for US$25m will bring in an annual rent of 
US$720,000 on a five year lease, with the first five year's rent in 
advance.
While this is an attractive proposition, the difficulty is to 
persuade companies to pre-let a building before construction starts.
Another aspect of the economic situation in Ukraine is that 
successful local entrepreneurs tend to move their money out of the 
country rather than spending it locally.
But, Ferguson believes that, potentially, Ukraine is a rich country.  
For centuries it has been referred to as the breadbasket of Europe 
because of its high grain production.  The Black Sea ports should 
become successful with the expansion of trade with Russia and other 
countries in the region.  And, while it may not be politically 
correct to mention it, Ukrainians are such heavy smokers that the 
large tobacco companies, Philip Morris and BAT, see a sizeable market 
for their products.

AVIATION - Defence Ministry stalls on rocket engine export deal

US and manufacture them there under licence are on hold following 
calls from Russia's Defence Ministry, to examine the economic and 
military implications of the deal, Interfax news agency reported on 
6th December.  The contract was concluded between Aerojet of the US 
and Samara-based Dvigateli NK.
A senior Defence Ministry official explained that although the 
original Lockheed Martin tender to find the best engine for the Atlas 
booster had envisaged only commercial launches "the US side changed 
the competition terms in November 1995S and there are now concerns 
that boosters with Russian engines could be used for military 
purposes.  The Defence Ministry has urged further examination of the 
contract since it has no authority to grant or deny export 
permission, which is the government's prerogative.
In addition, he said that the contractual price of an NK-33 engine, 
estimated at US$1.1m, not only failed to meet production costs but 
was much lower than world prices for analogous products, while US$5m 
for a licence to produce NK-33 engines in the US was simply Rabsurd."  
"Equipment of such a high level costs at least from US$100m to 
US$150m."
The official questioned whether the NK-33 project was the most 
economically-advantageous option.  He claimed that the contract to 
sell NK-33s in the US would bring Russia only US$100m, whereas Pratt 
& Whitney, also of the US, was willing to invest US$150m in the the 
state-run Energomnash company in the initial phase of co-operation, 
with a view to joint production of a new generation engine.  Under 
this alternative scheme, RProduction of RD-180 engines in Russia will 
allow Russia to receive orders worth over US$1bn within 20 years."
In a separate report, Interfax quoted the head of Aerojet's advanced 
research department, Mark Constantine, as telling a news conference 
in Sacramento, California, that he acknowledged Russian concerns but 
did not agree with them.  "Fifty per cent of modernised Atlas, Delta 
and Titan boosters with Russian engines are to be used for commercial 
flights and the remainder, for the sounding and photographing of the 
Earth, launch of cartographic satellites and monitoring the launches 
of ballistic missiles in third countries," he said.
Interfax said that Russia could lose more than US$350m unless 
permission to move the engines out of Russia and the licence for 
their manufacture in the US were forthcoming in the near future.  The 
NK-33, a reusable engine, was developed 25 years ago for the N-1 
booster which was to be used in the Soviet lunar programme.
On 9th December, Interfax said that the Aerojet contract to export 72 
NK-33 engines to the US was worth US$350m.

AVIATION - Russia to repay debt to Finland in surface to air missiles

Russia is to export air defence missile systems to Finland to clear 
part of a debt owed by the former Soviet Union, Russia's ITAR-TASS 
news agency reported on 30th November from Helsinki.
An agreement was reached at the end of a three-day conference of 
Russian and Finnish defence experts to export 1bn Finnish markka 
(US$230m) worth of Buk M1 missiles, known in the West as SA-11, to 
provide air defence around Helsinki.  The terms of the export 
contract have not yet been set, but deliveries are likely to start in 
1996.
The agency quoted Finnish Minister of Defence, Anneli Taina, as 
saying that the agreement was a major step towards resolving the 
issue of Russia's debt to Finland, which has been impeding trade 
between the two countries.  The debt owed by the former Soviet Union 
and taken on by Russia totals 5.5bn Finnish markka (US$1.25bn).
RIA news agency said the new missiles would replace the current 
Pechora (SA-3) air defence system around Helsinki by the year 2000.  
RIA quoted the chief of the Finnish defence forces, Gustav Heglund, 
as saying Finland relied on missile defences and not on aviation to 
ward off air attack, and that Finnish specialists had assessed the 
SA-11 as being best suited to the task.  "The high technical 
characteristics and quality of the system determined our choice," 
Heglund said.

BROADCASTING & TELECOMMUNICATIONS -
Italian group denies Russian telecom deal is off

Stet was still interested in acquiring a 25 per cent stake in Sviazinvest, 
the Russian telephone company due for privatisation, despite an 
official Russian notice that the deal was off.
In a statement issued on 26th December, the Italian group also denied 
that the recent Russian parliamentary elections had contributed to 
the failure to secure a deal planned by 22nd December.
The statement said complex legal considerations and the need for 
adequate guarantees had helped to postpone the purchase, which would 
cost Stet US$640m, with a commitment to invest a further US$770m.
Despite the Italian insistence on pressing ahead with the operation, 
Mr Maxim Boyko, head of the Russian Privatisation Centre, said that 
Stet would no longer be investing in Sviazinvest.  He said:  
"Although it was a difficult decision to reject the final conditions 
offered by Stet it was the right decision and I do not regret it."
Mr Boyko went on to describe Stet's behaviour as "impossible to 
understand" and he expressed confidence that the shares would be sold 
next year on terms considerably more favourable than those offered by 
Stet.
He discounted the political risk in delaying the tender until next 
year:  "I don't think that in the short run the political constraints 
would prevent the tender from happening."
The Russians objected to the recent demand by Stet that an escrow 
account be set up to hold the funds for investment until all the 
conditions sought by the Italians had been met.  Officials argued 
that the request showed an inappropriate distrust of the Russian 
government and unfairly went beyond the terms of the initial tender.
A Russian statement issued on 25th December said:  "Despite the 
desire of the Russian government to find a compromise, Stet insisted 
upon forms of payment that went beyond the conditions of the tender."
But Stet has said that the company had to be prudent and the escrow 
account was intended to demonstrate such prudence.  Stet's shares 
rose 2.2 per cent at  the news on the Milan bourse.  Analysts said 
the markets had regarded the Russian attempt to cancel the deal with 
scepticism, as Stet's offer was some US$200m above the nearest bid.
Stet has set five conditions for the completion of the acquisition.  
The most important of these centres on a clarification of the 
relationship between Sviazinvest and Rostelecom, the main Russian 
telecommunications company.
Sviazinvest is now a holding company for 85 regional telecoms firms 
in a so far ill-defined role.  Stet has not yet been satisfied 
regarding the role of those regional companies or future tariff 
structure.  These are also questions about long distance traffic 
within Russia and the valuable international telecoms business.
Until now Stet has tried and failed to break into large international 
telecoms contracts and business.  In Eastern Europe it has twice been 
passed over despite higher bids in Hungary and the Czech Republic in 
privatisation programmes.
It has been left to pick business in Latin American privatisations, 
being present in Argentina and latterly Bolivia.  Thus, the Russian 
deal was seen as an important opportunity.
From Russia's perspective, the reformist camp in the government has 
been anxious to make the telecoms sector a model for state 
divestment. This was particularly important for Mr Anatoly Chubais, 
the deputy prime minister and architect of Russian reforms, who was 
the main force behind telecoms privatisation.
The bond mass privatisation programme which Mr Chubais launched in 
1992 earned Russia praise for its swift reforms:  But last year, the 
country's privatisation record was marked by the second stage of 
privatisation which many observers have criticised as a secretive 
process, arranged to benefit government insiders.
For the Russian government, the telecoms privatisation was envisioned 
as an important source of budgetary revenue in 1995.  Moscow's urgent 
need to cover the deficit was one reason the government sought to 
push through the deal rapidly.  However, the government may prefer to 
proceed at a more leisurely pace now that the urgency which drove the 
tender has evaporated.

The connection is expected greatly to improve the quality of 
communications.  The agreement also provides for transition to 
digital networks.  Currently, Latvia and Belarus are connected by 120 
analogue lines, two-thirds of which run through Lithuania, while the 
rest go via Russia.  After the new system is introduced, Latvia and 
Belarus will no longer have to use the services of third countries.
The agreement is effective from 1996, after Lattelekom has an optical 
cable in place up to the country's eastern town of Kraslava.

ENERGY -Winners of LUKoil investment tender announced

The Russian investment company, Nikoil, has won an investment auction 
for a 16.07 per cent stake in LUkoil, Russia's biggest oil company, 
Interfax news agency reported on 28th December.
Nikoil won the auction with a pledge to invest R800bn, outbidding the 
only other contender, Yedinstvo-94, which offered R799bn.  Interfax 
quoted LUKoil officials as saying the investment programme for 1996-
1997 aimed to upgrade the company's refineries in Perm in the Urals 
and in Volgorad in Southern Russia, increasing the depth of refining 
there to 86-88 per cent, bringing quality in line with international 
standards and reducing production costs.
ITAR-TASS news agency said Nikoil had pledged to invest R160bn in the 
programme in January 1996, another R291bn before the end of 1996 and 
R349bn in 1997.  The implementation of the programme is expected to 
increase LUKoil's total annual output of oil products by 4m tonnes, 
including petrol output by 2m.
LUKoil incorporates seven oil producers and two oil refineries, 
Interfax recalled, adding that its annual output exceeded 50m tonnes 
of crude.

ENERGY - Russia,Total heading for oil and gas co-operation project

Russia plans to sign an agreement with France's Total to launch a 
joint oil and gas project in northern Russia, Interfax  reports.
The project, recently given the go-ahead by the Russian government,  
needs the approval of the administratation of the Nenets Autonomous 
Area, where the development work is to be launched to extact oil and 
gas condensate from the Kharyaginskoye desposit, which has estimated 
reserves of 160.4m tonnes.  Total is to invest US$1bn in the project.
Interfax quoted sources in the Nenets administration as saying 
approval for the agreements could prove difficult, since its 
opponents believed it did not allow the Russian side to seek greater 
participation in the project.  Meanwhile the Russian government's 
Expert Council said after studying the project that  a high content 
of hydrogen sulphide (up to 4 per cent) and parafinn (up to 20-25 per 
cent) in casing-head gas would necessitate the use of special anti-
corrosion equipment and technologies, which made the participation of 
Russian construction companies in the project doubtful.

ENERGY - Iran rejects Azeri proposal to develop Caspian oil and gas field

Iran has rejected an Azerbaijani offer of a share in the development 
of the Shakhdeniz oil and gas field in Azerbaijan's sector of the 
Caspian Sea, the Russian news agency reported from Tehran on 9th 
December.
The agency quoted an unnamed official at the Iranian Oil Ministry as 
saying that until "the question of the Caspian legal status and 
division of oil and gas field zones between the coastal states" was 
settled, Iranian participation in the development of Azerbaijani and 
other Caspian fields was "problematic."
The official said Iran was interested in joint oil development 
projects with Russia, and added that Tehran had submitted proposals 
to the Russian oil company, LUKoil, on 10 projects in the Gulf with 
costs ranging between US$1bn and US$4.5bn.
French-Norwegian alliance wins tender for operations in Caspian
A French-Norwegian alliance has won a tender to form a joint venture 
for offshore diving and underwater operations in the Caspian Sea, 
Interfax news agency reported on 27th November from the Azerbaijani 
capital, Baku.
The partners that won the tender, launched last July, are the French 
company, Comex, which produces diving equipment and underwater 
structures and develops underwater technologies, and a Norweigan 
company, identified as Stolp Komex Seaways, which constructs, 
inspects and repairs underwater pipelines.
Pyotr Gurtovenko of the Azerbaijani State Oil Company, told Interfax 
that the joint venture would be formed on the basis of the underwater 
and rescue operations department of his company.
He added that the involvement of such a strong alliance would help 
the new venture obtain an international certificate for underwater 
operations and take part in tenders announced by Azerbaijan's 
International Operational Company to co-ordinate the developmetn of 
the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields.

ENERGY - Russia helps build Beijing power station

Russia is to help China construct a heat and power station in the 
east of Beijing, which, when operational, will supply the whole of 
the east of the city with electricity and hot water,  reports the 
ITAR-TASS news agency.
The Huaneng-Beijing heat and power plant will have four power units 
and a total capacity of 654MW.
A spokesman for the Russian company, Energomasheksport, said that 
Russian organisations had completed design work on the plant and 40 
per cent of material and equipment had been delivered to the site.  
Given the "serious lack of demand" in the Russian economy, the 
project was supplying many Russian companies with major orders, the 
spokesman said, noting that more than 120 Russian enterprises were 
involved in the project.  In addition, for the first time in a 
Russian-Chinese projects accounts in the US$127.8m contract would be 
settled in convertible currencywhich was an "excellent opportunity" 
for Russian firms, he said.
Energomasheksport is contracted to carry out assembly work, supervise 
construction and train Chinese specialists.
Russia to resume Iranian nuclear plant construction early next year
Russia is likely to resume the construction of the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant in Southern Iran in January or February 1996, the Russian 
news agency ITAR-TASS  news agency  reports from Tehran, quoting 
Valentin Rumyantsev, head of the Russian trade mission there.  
Rumyantsev said, however, that a lot depended on the timely transfer 
of Iranian payments to the accounts of Russian organisations.  Under 
the terms of the US$800m contract, Iran must transfer to the Rusisan 
side at least 10 per cent of the project's cost, or about US$58m, in 
hard currency.  Other payments are to be made in Iranian currency, 
the rial, and in goods.
The contract to complete the construction of the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant by Russia was signed in Teheran in January 1995 and comes 
into force at the end of the year.  It said a delegation of experts 
from the Russian organisations involved in the project was to arrive 
in Tehran on 24th November to discuss a number of finanical and 
technical issues and to sign documents.

SPACE - Russian and US companies sign contract on space technology

Russian and US companies have signed their first ever contract in 
Russia on the provision of space photographs of the Earth's surface 
taken by Russia's military communications satellites.  Yuriy Milov, 
Deputy Director-General of the Russian Space Agency, said the work 
under the contract would be carried out by  the intersectoral 
association, Sovinformsputnik, in Russia and by the companies, 
Central Trading Systems, Lambda Tech International and Aerial Images, 
in the US.
According to Yuriy Milov, photographs of some areas in the American 
states of Florida, South and North Carolina and Alabama, as well as 
in some countries in the Asian Pacific region will be taken by the 
well-known Kosmos satellite which the machine-building works in 
Samara has been producing for over 15 years.  The task of the US 
companies will be to process and sell the photographs.  Their exact 
price has not yet been fixed but according to Yuriy Milov, it will be 
without consumer research.  
The joint venture will start operating in the middle of 1996.  Both 
the Russian and the American side preferred to keep silent on the 
subject of the contract's overall value.

TRANSPORT - Kraysnoye Sormovo shipyard allowed to sell submarine abroad

The Russian defence Ministry, has allowed the Krasnoye Sormovo 
shipyard in Nizhniy Novgorod to complete the construction of a 
Varshavyanka-class diesel-powered submarine begun in 1992, and sell 
it abroad, Interfax news agency reported on 12th December, from the 
city, quoting a source in the shipyard's management.
The ministry said, however, that it could not provide the plant with 
the necessary funding for the project.  Krasnoye Sormovo is now 
looking for a buyer for the submarine and for a creditor to provide 
funds to complete its construction.
Two Varshavyanka submarines were sold to the Chinese Navy earlier in 
the year for an estimated US$200-250m.  The shipyard has also held 
sales negotiations with Indonesia, India and Malaysia.
The volume of production at Krasnoye Sormovo fell by 27 per cent this 
year, largely because of the lack of solvent demand for its civilian 
output and the state's failure to order submarines.  The plant's only 
profit-yielding project is the production of river-sea cargo vessels.

AUTOMOBILE & AVIATION -
Company formed to modernise Moscow's airports; foreign investors needed

Transport on 28th November, decided to set up a new company, Aero-
Moskva, to gradually modernise the four airports - Sheremetyevo, 
Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Bykovo - that make up the hub of Russia's 
airways.
Vadim Zamotin, director of the Department of Air Transport of the 
Russian Transport Ministry, said the company would be made up of 
federal government shares of 50 per cent in Sheremetyevo, 50 per cent 
in Domodedovo, 25.5 per cent of Bykovo-Avia and 15.5 per cent of 
Vnukovo.  Overall, Moscow plans to borrow US$300m from the World Bank 
to modernise the hub, money that should be supplemented by the 
government, airlines, the airports themselves and foreign and 
domestic investors.  The airports, moreover, will be exempt from 
local and federal taxes.  So will anybody who invests in them.
There has not been any real capital investment in airports for the 
last five years, Zamotin said.  Problems with capacity and flight 
safety could emerge by the end of the century if something is not 
done now, he said.  
Passenger service, he admitted, falls well below international 
standards.  The whole system of flight control needs to be renovated.  
The Ministry of Transport, Zamotin said, has drawn up a US$5bn 
investment programme to take the hub to the year 2025.  Immediate 
problems should be solved by 1997, (when Moscow is due to mark its 
850th anniversary) at a cost of R1,276bn.
The four Moscow airports account for 27 per cent and 17 per cent of 
all domestic passenger and freight turnover and 74 per cent of 
international passenger traffic.  Over 70 airlines are based in the 
city and region of Moscow.

BANKING - Latvian Universal Bank signs agreement with EBRD

credit agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and

Unibanka will receive US$20m over six years as loan capital for 
various  projects.  The EBRD already has credit lines to Latvia's 
Zemes Banka (Land Bank) and the Vacijas-Latvijas Banka (German-
Latvian Bank).
Bank of Latvia revokes licences of six commercial banks
The Bank of Latvia has revoked the licences of the Latvian Deposit 
Bank (LDB), Central Bank, the Liepaja commercial bank, the Alejas 
commercial bank, Olti-Bank and the Lettika commercial bank, Baltic 
News Service reported from Riga on 6th December, quoting Centre 
Bank's press centre.
The Latvian Commercial Court declared Centre Bank insolvent on 6th 
June, LDB on 12th June, Liepaja commercial bank on 14th June, the 
Alejas commercial bank on 10th July, and the Olti-Bank on 15th 
November.  A decision to liquidate Olti-Bank was taken on 15th 
December.
Explaining the reasons for the revocation of the licences, Baltic 
News Service said that the capital of LDB, Central Bank and the 
Liepaja and Alejas commercial banks was smaller than the minimum 
shareholding capital set out in banking legislation.  LDB, Liepaja 
and Alejas banks had also failed to observe the rules on short-term 
liquidity.  Lettika's licence was revoked because it had not 
undertaken the work required to put it finances in order after Bank 
of Latvia President, Einars Repse had banned it from performing any 
banking transactions with effect from 30th August of last year.

Russia to draw more foreign investment into telecommunications 

Russia to draw more foreigin investments into telecommunications 
in 1996, Interfax news agency reported on 28th November, 
quoting Communications Minister, Vladimir Bulgak.
Bulgak said the emphasis would be on attracting major companies, 
which are expected to contribute 41.5 per cent of total investment.  
This year foreign businesses have invested US$520m in Russian 
telecommunications.  According to Bulgak, this shows that they regard 
the section as attractive.
The agency quoted Bulgak as saying foreign investment was 
particularly important now that government support for 
telecommunications had almost ceased.  Other sources of extra funding 
for the sector, the minister said, will include the circulation of 
"telephone bonds," a more effective tariff policy and the 
introduction of charges for local calls in 1996.

CREDIT & DEBIT - EBRD helps Russian-Spanish joint venture

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  (EBRD) will 
provide a US$11m (ECU9.1m) loan to the Russian-Spanish Joint venture 
AO Bashkortostan-Kelme.  The company is located in Meleuz (Repubic of 
Bashkortostan), Russian Federation, approximately 1,200-kilometres 
south-east of Moscow and 200km north of Ufa, reported a recent EBRD 
press release. 
AO Bashkortostan-Kelme will manufacture a large variety of high-
quality sports and leisure shoes, primarily for the Russian domestic 
market.  Given the strong historical tradition of the former Soviet 
Union in the area of athletics, the project sponsors expect the 
domestic market for such shoes to grow substantially over the coming 
years.  The joint venture will also manufacture all necessary 
components for the sports and leisure shoes and will assume the role 
of supplier of such components to the other Kelme joint venture in 
Eastern Europe (in Moldova and Belarus).
The joint venture will be equipped with modern shoe production 
equipment, sourced primarily from Spain, Italy and Japan.  EBRD 
financing will be used to a large extent for the acquisition of such 
equipment as well as for working capital purposes.  In addition to 
the technology transfer benefit associated with the project, over 700 
new skilled jobs will be created in the region of Bashkortostan over 
the next years.  The project is also expected to stimulate local 
suppliers of leather and other materials required for the production 
of shoes.  An additional beneficial effect for the country is the 
substitution of domestic production for hard currency imports. 
The loan has seven  years maturity including a grace period of 1.5 
years, and amounts to US$11 million.  Its spread is LIBOR-based plus 
a credit margin.
The project will be co-financed to the amount of US$11.4m by Banco 
Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Instituto de Crdito Official (IOC), with 
export credit coverage provided by Companola de Crdito a la Exportacion 
del Desarrollo (COFIDES), a Spanish governmental agency specialised 
in the promotion of Spanish investments abroad that will provide a 
subordinated loan to the joint venture.  For further information,

CREDIT & DEBIT - Spanish-Moldovan footwear joint venture

US$7.3m (ECU 6.0 million) loan will go to the Spanish-Moldovan joint 
venture, Ascom-Kelme S.A., to partially finance equipment and working 
capital needs for a shoe production facility in Orhei, Republic of 
Moldova, reported The European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development  (EBRD) on 31st October.  The creation of a local 
production and distribution capacity for high-quality sports and 
leisure shoes will serve the needs of the markets of Moldova, Russia 
and other countries of the former Soviet Union, and Romania.  Once 
full production capacity is reached, the joint venture will produce 
three million sports and leisure shoes per year.
The investment will create 1,200 jobs in a district with high 
unemployment and is expected to generate significant hard currency 
earnings for Moldova.  The joint venture will benefit from state-of 
the-art Western machinery and will have full technological and 
training support by the Spanish partner.  In addition the project is 
designed to rely primarily on production inputs from the Russian 
Federation and other countries of the former Soviet Union and is 
therefore expected to create significant backward linkages with 
suppliers of the shoes industry of the region, used to finance shoe 
production machinery and working capital needs.
Five years' maturity includes a grace period; interest on the US$7.3 
million loan is LIBOR-based plus a credit margin.  The project will 
be co-financed to the amount of US$7.2m (ECU5.9m) by Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya and Instituto de Crdito Official, with export coverage 
provided by Compania Espanola de Seguros de Crdito a la Exportacion. For

The board of the International Monetary Fund has approved an extended 
loan to Kyrgyzstan of US$48m within the framework of an agreed three-
year credit programme, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS reported 
from Washington.  The funds are being allocated to support a 
programme of economic and structural reforms being carried out by the 
Kyrgyz government.The three-year programme for Kyrgyzstan was 
approved by the IMF in May 1994 and originally provided for a total 
of US$105m.  However, taking account of the country's "considerable 
progress" in implanting reforms the Fund decided to increase the loan 
to US$131m.
The aim of the programme is to achieve by the end of 1996 a 2.5 per 
cent growth in GDP, a reduction in the annual rate of inflation to 15 
per cent and a cut in the budget deficit from the current 11.3 per 
cent of GDP to 5.5 per cent.

Vinnikava said all the necessary calculations had been completed and 
a draft presidential decree drawn up.  Many economists in the country 
support the introduction of the so-called "hard-currency corridor" as 
an alternative to a rapid devaluation of the Belarusian rouble.
According to Vinnikava, the lower limit of the fixed band is to be 
set initially at the current exchange rate of 11,000 Belarusian 
roubles to the dollar.

State Property and head of the commission organising the auction, 
Alfred Kokh.
The consortium offered the Russian government a loan of US$35.10m for 
the shares, US$0.1m more than the asking price of US$35m, which was 
offered by rival bidder, the National Reserves Bank. Under the terms 
of the shares-for-loans auction, the winner is to pay off debts of up 
to R500bn run by the LUKoil subsidiaries.
LUKoil extracted 45.1m tonnes of crude oil in 1994 and refined 19.7m 
tonnes.

ENERGY -Yukos postpones sale of 8 per cent stake till next year

Russia's Federal Property Fund has postponed the sale of 7.96 per 
cent of shares in the Yukos oil company to prevent its being 
overshadowed by the shares-for-loans auction and investment tender 
under which a 78 per cent holding in the company which was to be sold 
on 8th December, Interfax news agency reported.
A Yukos spokesman said that the decision had been made at the request 
of the company management, which was worried that shares might be 
undervalued if sold too soon after the larger block.  The cash 
auction is now likely to be held in the first quarter of 1996.
Under plans for privatising Yukos, 45 per cent of company shares are 
to remain state property for three years.  Investment bids will be 
invited for 33 per cent of shares on 8th December, at the same time 
as 78 per cent of state-owned shares are sold in a shares-for loans 
auction.  Of the remaining 22 per cent, 14 per cent are to be 
distributed amongst Yukos staff and management and the remainder will 
now be sold at cash auction next year.
Russian coal industry could get US$500m loan from World Bank
The World Bank is likely to grant Russia a loan of US$500m  to back 
reforms in its coal industry, Interfax news agency reported on 27th 
October, quoting the bank's president, James Wolfensohn.
According to Wolfensohn, reforms to be developed jointly with the 
Russian side in 1996-97 will aim to provide more social guarantees 
for miners, including retraining and employment of redundant workers.  
Before this, however, the Russian government should start a systemic 
transformation of the coal industry, reducing state subsidies, 
ensuring higher profits from coal production under market conditions 
and closing the most inefficient pits.

ENERGY -World Bank prolongs loan terms for oil company

The World Bank has extended the term of its 1993 loan of US$168m to 
Russian oil company, Purneftegaz, to purchase oilfield equipment for 
another 12 months, Interfax news agency reported on 6th December, 
quoting a source within the company management.
The extension has been granted because Purneftegaz has so far 
purchased equipment worth only US$40m, the source said.  Moreover, in 
the summer, the company had to suspend the loan when duty exemptions 
initially envisaged in the agreement between the World Bank and the 
Russian government were abolished by the State Customs Committee.
Purneftegaz, a subsidiary of the Rosneft oil company, is developing 
the Gubinskoye, Severo-Tarasovskoye and Kharampurskoye oilfields in 
the north of Tyumen Region.  The company produced 8.5m tonnes of oil 
in 1994.

ENERGY -Ukraine's gas debt to Russia threatens IMF loan

Ukraine risks promised International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds if it 
fails to pay US$92m of its gas debt to Russia for supplies in 1994, 
Russian Public TV reported on 6th December, quoting Ukrainian Deputy 
Finance Minister, Borys Sobolev.
The credit under threat is the next tranche of a multi-stage IMF 
loan.  The first stages have already been received by Ukraine and 
have been placed in the foreign currency reserves of the Bank of 
Ukraine, leaving the IMF "surprised" at the country's failure to pay 
the gas debt.  Ukraine's total gas debt to Russia now stands at 
US$240m.
The television report said Ukraine cannot pay off its external debt 
before its collects it internal debt.  In November the state gas 
supplier, Ukrgaz, cut off about 400 debtor enterprises, and a further 
300 will soon follow: this has not boosted income, but merely reduced 
expenditure.
Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister, Pavel Lazarenko was quoted as 
saying he hoped Ukraine would clear the debt by the start of the new 
year, repaying a quarter of the US$92m in raw materials and metals.
Failure to do so will result in the withholding of the IMF money.  
"Moreover, it is quite possible that the IMF will demand the result 
of its latest credit, as it was allocated, precisely to pay off the 
foreign debt for gas used in 1994," Lazarenko was quoted as saying.

MINING - Shares in Kazakh ferroalloy monopolist up for sale

The Kazkhrom transnational company, the monopoly producer of 
ferroalloys in Kazakhstan, is to sell 3.2 per cent of its shares at 
the Central Asian Stock Exchange, the Russian news agency, Interfax, 
reported from Alma-Ata on 4th December.
The state-owned shares, valued at 341.92m tenge (about US$3.8m) are 
to be sold in a series of tenders starting on 5th December, 
Kazkhrom's charter capital is 7.56bn tenge, the equivalent of 
US$118.5m, the agency said, adding that according to exchange experts 
foreign investors might be interested in purchasing the shares.
Kazkhrom was formed in June 1995, when three Kazakh chrome 
enterprises - an ore-dressing plant, the Ferrochrome joint-stock 
company in Aktyubinsk Region, and the Yermak ferroalloy plant in 
Pavlodar Region - passed under the control of the Japan Chrome 
Corporation for five years.  Under the terms of the agreement, the 
Japanese receive 2 per cent of  revenues from product sales and hold 
a 25 per cent stake in Kazkhrom.

Over 30 per cent of shares in the Russian gold company, Buryatzoloto, 
are now controlled by the World Bank as a result of a cash auction 
held in Ulan-Ude, the capital of the Russian constituent republic of 
Buryatia, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 4th December from the 
city.
Over 134,000 shares in Buryatzoloto, consisting of a 28 per cent 
holding in this, the biggest company in Buryatia, were put up for 
sale at the auction.  They were bought for over R15bn by Proyekt-
Finans-Konsalt, a Moscow-based company established by the World Bank.  
The agency recalled that the company had already bought just over 2 
per cent of shares in Buryatzoloto last year.
Proyekt-Finans-Konsalt now intends to make considerable investments 
in the development of the gold industry in Buryatia.

STOCKS & SHARES - The state short-term bond market

The market for state securities is one of the most powerful non-
inflationary tools for financing the budget deficit, and the state 
pins serious hopes on it.  There are now more than 50 trillion 
roubles worth of state securities in circulation.  They are above all 
state short-term bonds (GKO).  These bonds are highly profitable, 
which is somewhat disquieting since the higher their profitability, 
the lower their reliability and vice versa, according to the laws of 
the securities markets in advanced countries, reports ECONews.
According to the 1996 draft budget, two-thirds of the 3.9 per cent 
deficit of the Gross Domestic Product will be covered by issuing 
domestic loans.  This will call for issuing and placing an even 
larger volume of GKOs, whose annual turnover on the state securities 
market has topped US$200m, or 3 times more than in the beginning of 
the year.
The high profitability of and, hence, the high demand for and high 
turnover of GKO securities has, on the one hand, led to the flow of 
investments and financial resources to the GKO sphere.  On the other 
hand, as the state lacks resources to buy out payment-due GKO bonds 
from previous issues, it has to direct towards these ends practically 
all the receipts from new state security tranches.  This was the case 
in September and October and may be replicated later on.  
Specialists view this way of combating inflation as another financial 
pyramid of the MMM type (MMM is a notorious company which engaged in 
this practice), though done at the initiative and on the scope of the 
state.  The GKO does not resolve the central issue, for which an 
entire mechanism of state securities was put in operation: state 
short-term bonds do not restrain, but instead spur inflation, 
believes Mikhail Delyagin, in charge of the group for economic 
problems of the Analytical Department under the President of the 
Russian Federation.

STOCKS & SHARES - St Petersburg lures the West with bonds

St Petersburg plans to issue bonds aimed at overseas investors for 
the first time since the 1917 Russian Revolution.  But fund managers 
say a combination of high risks and market restrictions will make it 
difficult to attract foreigners, reports The European.
City mayor Anatoly Sobchak said at a presenation in early December in 
London that St Petersburg will issue US$500m worth of bonds, 
denominated in roubles, in 1996.  The city recently received 
permission to issue bonds with a life of more than a year, which 
foreginers could buy.
It has already issued three, six and nine month bonds, worth US$370m, 
but they are only sold domestically because, under Russian law bonds 
with a life of less than a year cannot be converted into a foreign 
currency.
Emerging market fund managers say they would like to buy the short-
term municipal bonds and GKOs (Russian treasury bills), because of 
their very high yeilds, which average more than 100 per cent.
The fund managers went to the presentation hoping the St Petersburg 
short-term bonds would offer a loophole, allowing the repatriation of 
proceeds, one said.  He said the risk of a devaluation of the rouble 
made longer-term bonds unattractive.  "Eighteen months is a long time 
in Russia," he said. Political worries focus on parliamentary 
elections in December, in which  communists did well, and on the 
presidential election next June.
Fund managers will now wait in the hope that the Russian govenrment 
will relax its rules on repatriating funds some time next year, 
allowing foreigners into the short-term GKO and municipal bond 
markets.
St Petersburg needs the municipal bond funds to help with its budget 
deficit and to finance development projects.  Andrew Dobson, a 
consultant on Russian financial projects, said the city wanted to 
gauge Western investors' interest in longer-term bonds.
Leading bank plans big share issue
Shareholders in Gazbank, a leading commercial bank in Turkmenistan, 
have decided to increase its authorised capital from 25m to 100m 
manats by launching a second issue, Turkmen press agency reported on 
9th December.
The new 75m-manat issue is expected to be in the form of ordinary 
shares with a par value of 100,000 manats each.  The dividend 
forecast is for no less than 70 per cent per annum, the agency said, 
adding that applications to purchase over 70 per cent of the new 
shares had already been registered.  The Russian bank, Rossiyskiy 
Kredit, which already holds a 5 per cent stake in Gazbank's 
authorised capital, is among those interested in buying some of the 
new shares.
Gazbank's shareholders intend to increase its authorised capital 
further to 300m manats in 1996.  Foreign investors will be encouraged 
to acquire stakes, but the bank's Turkmen founders are to retain a 
controlling block of shares.
Gazbank issues short and medium-term credits to large private 
commercial structures in Turkmenistan, the agency recalled, adding 
that the proposed increase in the bank's authorised capital would 
enable it to "expand its lending volume significantly."

STOCKS & SHARES - Lithuania makes international debut in dollars

The Republic of Lithuania on 11th December made its international 
bond market debut, issuing US$60m of 10 per cent, two-year bonds via 
Nomura International.
"Our entry into the international capital markets provides valuable 
diversification of Lithuania's funding sources and confirms 
international confidence in the progress of Lithuania's rapid 
economic transformation," said Algimantas Krizinauskas, deputy 
minister for finance.
With the Litas, the national currency, pegged to the US dollar, the 
country's decision to tap the dollar sector seemed a natural one.  
Moreover, "the dollar market will provide them with the best 
opportunity to establish the name of Lithuania among a wide range of 
investors," said one banker.
At the re-offer price of 99.90, the bonds yield 444.8 basis points 
over the corresponding US Treasury note.  The proceeds will be used 
by Lithuania for general financing purposes.
The deal was said to have been heavily pre-marketed ahead of launch, 
and was reported to have met a good response, especially from 
emerging-market fund managers in the US.
LG Semicon, a South Korean semiconductor maker, issued US$100m of 
6.375 per cent five-year bonds yielding 80 basis points over the US 
benchmark at the 99.68 re-offer price.  The deal was also led by 
Nomura, which reported a positive response from fund managers in Asia 
and Europe, especially Germany.
The Republic of Colombia issued Y15bn of 3 per cent five-year bonds 
via Merill Lynch and Kokusai Europe.  Yielding about 100 basis points 
over yen Libor, the bonds were considerably more tightly priced than 
Colombia's recent D-Mark offering priced at around 170 basic points 
over Libor.
However, like other issuers in recent months, Colombia was able to 
exploit Japanese retail investors' hunger for assets that offer a 
significant yield pick-up over domestic products.  "Japanese retail 
investors don't look at comparative value - they just look for higher 
yields," said one dealer.
Crdit Local de France issued FFr5bn of four-year bonds via CDC and 
Socit Gnrale, yielding 20.5 basis points over the corresponding 
French government bond.

Russian heavy-truck maker, Kamaz, based in Naberezhnyye Chelny in the 
constituent republic of Tatarstan, has produced the first batch of a 
new series of ecologically-clean engines following modernisation of 
its engine plant, gutted by fire two years ago, ITAR-TASS news agency

The fully upgraded plant is now making advanced engines for trucks 
and buses.  Three models received certification in September, 
confirming compliance with European rules on exhaust smoke density 
and toxicity.
Kamaz is to make 150 trucks fitted with the new engines by the end of

AUTOMOBILES & AVIATION - GAZ lorry factory output up, new models planned

GAZ of Nizhniy Novgorod, arguably Russia's best-performing car and 
truck maker, has posted better output for almost all of its models in 
January-October 1995 and is scheduling the launch of a new range of 
Gazelle light truck modifications and negotiating joint manufacturing 
deals with foreign firms.
The company said it made 169,760 automobiles in January-October, 10.2 
per cent more than in the same period of last year, including 100,570 
cars (up 3.1 per cent) and 69,190 trucks (up 22.4 per cent).
GAZ has practially monoplised the Russian market for light urban 
trucks with its nippy Gazelle.  It turned out 48,346 of them in the 
first 10 months of this year, mostly the basic tarpaulin model.  It 
made 14,000 of the trucks from its launch to the end of 1994.  The 
company started making a whole-metal body modification on 15th 
December.  The company, meanwhile, last November struck a deal with 
the rest of Russia's main car and truck makers not to raise prices 
for at least three months.  GAZ has held its prices steady since 
August.
Geenadiy Suvorov, who advises the company's President Nikolay Pugin, 
said the company turned out its 15-millionth automobile on 4th 
December.  It was a six-seat Gazelle developed in conjunction with 
Sokol, a Nizhniy Novgorod fighter aircraft factory, as part of a 
local defence conversion programme, Nizhniy Novgorod Automobiles.
Executives from both Daewoo of South Korea and the Ford Motor Company 
of the US visited the plant in October for talks on possible 
manufacturing ventures.  Vladimir Churagev, GAZ's top manufacturing 
executive, held similar negotiations with BMW in Germany.  However, 
most manufacturers are only offering GAZ the right to make outdated 
models.  Talks, however, have made headway with Zahnrad Fabrik of 
Germany on a joint project to make five-gear transmissions.
GAZ in 1994 made 190,000 units, including 118,000 cars and 72,000 
trucks.
Orenburg defence factory to produce civilian helicopters
The Strela production  assocation, a former defence industry 
engineering works in the Urals town of Orenburg, is to start

The helicopter is to be produced in two modifications, for cargo, 
with a maximum payload of 1,000kg, and for passengers, with a pod 
accommodating 6 people.  The company has already  received orders 
from several customers, including the Russian Ministry of Civil 
Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disasters. Israel, Taiwan and the 
Central Asian states have also expressed interest.

ECOLOGY - Pure water emerald

In the West, ecologically-clean products indicate that people care 
for their own health and seek a lifestyle to which food producers 
quickly react.  The latest fad is a litre of drinking water bought 
which costs US$1 at your local food stores.  It costs, doesn't it?  
It is nobody's secret that the quality of water in many Russian 
cities leaves much to be desired.  Foreign and Russian gadgets for 
household and neighbourhood water treatment are costly to use because 
their filters have to be replaced.  This is the explanation for the 
high cost of drinking water, reports Know-How from Russia/95 of RIA - 
Novosti.
The water treatment unit, Emerald, for household use, created by 
specialists at the Moscow-based scientific-technical joint venture 
which bears that name, is unprecedented, a forerunner of a world 
ecological revolution, specialists maintain.  Its operational 
principle is as simple as it is original.  Electrochemical activation 
occurs in a light plastic cylinder.  Anode oxidation destroys 
pathogenic micro-organisms.  Active chlorine compounds are decomposed 
and ions of heavy metals are restored on the cathode to become 
isolated in precipitation. Meanwhile, the water preserves the health 
valuable elements - fluorine, calcium and magnesium salts.  The pot 
in which such water is boiled accumulates no scale whatsoever.
Clinical tests show that Emerald-treated water improves immunity and 
makes people less prone to allergic diseases.  Especially in the case 
of kidney ailments.  its principle of operation can be used for 
disinfecting water in swimming pools and even municipal water 
treatment plants, replacing costly and environmently-hazardous 
chemical forms of treatment.
At the request of livestock breeders, experts from Emerald JV have 
also developed a method for raising calves, using water processed by 
their unit.  The method improves the stock, hence the beef quality.  
Ecologically-speaking, the beef is cleaner.
Most importantly, the new water-treatment method is economical.  No 
expendable materials are needed.  It calls for only electricity, 
though less than that used by an electric bulb, to produce up to 350 
litres of pure water ran hour.  That costs about 20 kopecks, instead 
of a dollar, per litre.

ENERGY - Subsoil nuclear power plant

Russia's Minatom (Ministry for Nuclear Energy), Goskomoboronprom 
(State Committee for the Defence Industry) and Mintopenergo (Ministry 
for Fuel and Energy) have brought their heads together to build the 
country's first Subterranean Atomic Heat and Electricity Station 
(PATES) in the Murmansk Region, reports Know-How from Russia/95 of 
RIA - Novosti.
The idea of building a subterranean nuclear power plant (PATES) was 
put forward in his time by Academician Andrei Sakharov.  Now it is 
implemented by the Academician A Krylov Central Research Institute.  
In a competition of small-capacity units for subsoil power facilities 
the well-reputed KLT-40 reactor used in nuclear-powered iceboats was 
picked out.
The capacity of the subterranean nuclear power plant will be 300 
megawatts (six 50-mWt units).  It is enough to supply heat and 
electricity for a large naval base, which is currently engaged in 
destroying nuclear-powered submarines under treaties on arms 
reduction.  The developers of the Shtokman natural gas field are also 
interested in the building of the station.  Gas will be pumped along 
ferroconcrete pipes, whose manufacture calls for heavy power inputs.
Is it really advantageous to build subterranean nuclear power 
stations?  Hard rocks protect not only against radiation but 
represent an exceptionally reliable envelope which can withstand 
loads by several degrees of ten larger than any ferroconcrete or 
metal structures.  Air-tight locking contraptions will ensure 
protection against possible external effects, including even acts of 
subversion.  Located underground, nuclear reactors call for less 
anti-seismic measures.
Specialists hope that the first step towards safe subsoil technology 
in nuclear electricity generation will be a success.
Nuclear submarine plant begins construction of drilling platform
A nuclear submarine plant in the northern Russian town of 
Severodvinsk has for the first time started the construction of an 
offshore oil drilling platform, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 4th 
December, from Severodvinsk.
The plant, which builds nuclear-powered submarines for the Russian 
Navy, is expected to take several years to complete the project.  The 
platform, designed by specialists from St Petersburg and 
Severodvinsk, is to be used to develop an oilfield in the Arctic 
shelf of the Barents Sea, 60km from the shore.  The oilfield has 
estimated reserves exceeding 100m tonnes.
Lithuania installs new network of radiation monitoring stations
Danish experts have completed the assembly of an automated station to 
monitor gamma radiation at the Lithuanian Ministry of Environmental 
Protection in Vilnius, the Baltic News Service reported from the 
Lithuanian capital, on 28th November.
The construction of similar stations has began in the towns of 
Turmantas, Visaginas, Rimse and Gaide, all located "a dozen 
kilometres" from Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear power plant.  The 
agency quoted a press spokeman for the Ministry of Environment 
Protection as saying a network incorporating eight such stations was 
to be built in the country with Danish help, under an agreement 
between the Lithuanian ministry and Denmark's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Work on the project was started by Sweden and was later 
taken over by the Danes, BNS said.
Although minor accidents occur quite often at the Ignalina plant, 
official sources have always maintained that there have been no 
changes in background radiation around it.  The new network of 
monitoring stations, the agency said, would make it possible to 
observe any changes, discover their cause and issue prompt warnings 
to people in the country, to neighbouring states and to international 
organisations.  The main drawback of the existing radiation 
monitoring facilities, which include a small system inside the 
Ignalina plant, several automated monitoring points within 30km and 
equipment for measuring gamma radiation at various weather stations 
throughout Lithuania, is that information collected there cannot be 
conveyed promptly to any central control station, BNS said.

ENERGY - A warm future

Tartu in Estonia is being fast-forwarded to an environmentally 
friendly future by Western technology- and its residents are getting 
better heating systems for the long, cold winter into the 
bargain.Extensive programmes, to cut heat loss, reduce energy 
consumption and convert boilers from fossil fuel to bio-fuels mean 
the town has a cheaper cleaner, more efficient and more reliable 
heating system than before.
"We feel we have joined the 21st Century," says Enn Pernam, director 
of Tatu's Aardla boiler plant - new fed by wood chips instead of oil 
- after the inefficiencies and waste of the Soviet era.
Aardla is one of more than 40 Baltic regional projects relying on 
financial and technical assistance from Nutek, a Swedish public-
sector organisation promoting technology and energy efficiency.
Nutek's aim is to improve energy efficiency in Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania (and, to a more limited extent, Russia and Poland) by 
working with municipalities and local companies to convert boilers 
and improve heat distribution and building standards.
The idea is to try to bolster environmental protection by 
reconstructing boiler houses to operate wholly on local fuel, and 
reducing energy loss in residential houses and heating systems.
Other Western organisations involved in similar projects include the 
World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Among Swedish companies involved in the work, Energiakonsult has 
provided technical skills, and KMW Energi has supplied equipment.  
Local companies have participated in the reconstruction of the boiler 
houses.
The two sides have contrasting motives.  The Baltic states have an 
obvious financial interest in cheaper fuel after a surge in prices 
since their independence from the Soviet Union (where heating was 
supplied at completely uncommercial rates) four years ago.  An 
average Estonian can spend up to a third of his salary on heating.
The Swedes are more interested in helping the Baltic States cut their 
output of carbon dioxide as part of joint implementation 
arrangements, where one country can gain a credit for lowering the 
CO2 output of another.  Both sides seem to be achieving their 
objectives.  Using wood chips instead of oil has cut the fuel bills 
of some Baltic boiler plants by up to 50 per cent.
Pername says the Aardla conversion is cutting fuel costs by 2.1m Estonian 
crowns a year.  Nutek, meanwhile, says its projects will cut CO2 
production by as much as 250,000 tonnes a year, as well as reducing 
output of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide.
The main idea is to use the savings from lower fuel costs to repay 
the loans advanced by Nutek to finance the improvements. But that 
means that, initially at least, end-users are not generally getting 
lower heating bills.
"This is essentially a commercial operation," says Hans Nilsson, the 
head of Nutek's energy efficiency unit.  Loans are granted by Nutek 
to plant owners at Stockholm Interbank Offered Rates (currently about 
8.65 per cent) and are repayable over 10 years, with a two-year 
period of grace.  As security, Nutek gets guarantees from local 
municipalities and real estate as collateral.  In one case in Latvia, 
the security is a municipal cinema.
Where Nutek believes its concept scores is in the wider benefits it 
offers.  Residents might not be getting lower fuel bills, but they 
are getting better value for money - longer heating seasons, higher 
average room temperatures and hot water during summer.
Benefits also include reduced wastage, better heat regulation and 
heating systems that last longer.
"We are aiming for better all-round quality.  In the past, the way 
people cooled down was simply by opening the window," says Gudrun 
Knutsson, the programme's project leader.
Nutek's priorities are speed, affordability and reliability.  It 
emphasises simple, tried-and-tested technology and cuts through red 
tape by keeping involvement with national governments to a minimum.
It also provides a consultant to assist the local project leader with 
implementation.  Significantly, there is no "buy Swedish" 
requirements attached to the loans, which not only benefits other 
international suppliers but also companies in the Baltic region, 
where costs are lower.  Swedish companies are, nevertheless, winning 
a substantial number of contracts and are linking up with Baltic 
companies to boost business.
Nutek has committed Skr227.5m to its Baltic energy projects and has 
recently been promised a further SKr50m from the Swedish government.  
The idea is that, as loan and interest are repaid, funds are recycled 
to new projects.  However, Nutek does not expect to fully recoup its 
outlays, partly because its anticipates some defaults.
Not  everything has gone smoothly.  Some residents are not paying 
their fuel bills - because they are so high - meaning that plant 
owners are also finding the going tough.  There are also questions to 
access to wood chips and prices.  In Lithuania, for example, the 
state has a strong hand because it owns much of the forest.  Middle 
men have also tried to drive up prices by cornering supplies.  
Finally, there are continuing political and legal uncertainties which 
could undermine the value of the securities and guarantees pledged.
Nutek says its model works particularly well in Baltic states because 
they have already access to wood and a strong desire to be more self-
sufficient in energy and cut costly imports.  It works less well in 
Poland, which is keen to support a substantial domestic coal 
industry.
But the Swedish organisation is not discouraged.  Nilsson says there 
are many more projects needing to be financed.  Indeed, he is trying 
to promote a clearing house system that will bring potential 
financiers together with municipalities and local companies in 
Eastern Europe to drive the process further.

RUSSIA EXPRESS EXECUTIVE BRIEFING via NewsNet
JANUARY 15, 1996

Russia rejoins the Space Race; Intersputnik

In the early 1980s, when the first European satellite 
televisionentrepreneurs wanted to show off the capabilities of their 
big, expensive dishes, as often as not they tuned into signals from a 
Russian Gorizont satellite; here was a technology which could leap 
the Iron Curtain and do no end of good for East-West relations.
Now, 15 years on, the Iron Curtain's gone, the Soviet empire has 
disintegrated, and those same Gorizonts are part of a large - if 
largely ageing - Russian satellite fleet which still plays a big role 
in the international broadcasting industry.  It may not be quite the 
leading role envisaged by those who saw a potentially world-beating 
space industry, liberated from the dead hand of Soviet bureaucracy.  
But the latest signals out of Moscow and St Petersburg suggest that, 
after five years of false dawns and unrealised dreams, a renaissance 
is at last under way.
This might surprise those Western operators whose belief in the 'new' 
Russia has been stretched by recent repeated launch delays and 
unexplained changes of plan, harking back to the worst days of the 
old regime.  Like every other sector in the Russian economy, the 
satellite industry has been hit by economic chaos, which is far from 
resolved; in some sectors, such as the TV industry, the point has 
been reached where some stations can't even pay their electricity 
bills for transmission.  The chief impact on the hybrid state/private 
sector satellite industry has been an inability to keep to its 
replacement (Express) satellite launch schedule - a vital process 
which virtually ground to a halt in early 1995, ostensibly as a 
direct result of the Rimsat debacle (see below).
And so, far from becoming a powerful rival to Western satellite 
operators, Russia has been losing clients to them, even those early 
'breakthrough' clients, CNNI and TV5.  A further blow was former 
Soviet republic Kazakhstan's recent decision to switch all TV 
distribution from Russian satellites to the Intelsats at 57 and 66 
degrees East.  This, according to Intelsat regional director CIS, 
Central and Eastern Europe, Yuli Wexler, was partly due to the ageing 
Russian fleet - "Their schedule for replacement has been falling 
behind," partly to Intelsat technical support services.  For similar 
reasons Intelsat has been picking up significantly more Russian  
business both in telecoms (it has recently set up its first intra-
Russian network with RussTelecom and Teleport TP) and in TV and SNG 
traffic --"TASS, for example, has become a large user of Intelsat 
globally."
Now, as so often in the past five years, the industry is making all 
the right noises about co-operation, openness and technological 
upgrading - but will it happen?
Two recent deals indicate that serious progress has been made in 
parts of the industry already.  SES's decision last year to use the 
Russo-American Lockheed-Krunichev-Energia International consortium to 
launch Astra 1F atop a Russian Proton rocket underlined the West's 
new-found confidence in Russian space technology.  A further boost 
came in July, when Eutelsat decided to order its first made-in-Russia 
spacecraft, SESAT, from manufacturer NPO-PM of Krasnoyarsk, again 
using Proton for its slated early 1998 launch.  The 18-transponder 
payload for this craft will, however, be built by Alcatel-Espace in 
France.  And Intelsat, which has yet to make direct use of Russian 
expertise, is looking closely at Proton:  "We've talked to the 
owners, seen the launches at Baikonur, and it's entirely possible 
that we can use it at some stage; we're not excluding the 
possibility," Wexler says.
But while the launch and construction side of the industry is alive 
and kicking, what of the long-awaited boom in attracting Russian 
satellite capacity?  Ironically, the very success of Proton could be 
affecting progress in this area:  "The elevation of launch costs is 
ripping the heart out of the industry," one foreign ex-client notes:  
"In 1992 a launch was under US$5m, now it's US$70m; it means they can 
no longer be so competitive."
Currently there are 17 geostationary Russian satellites providing 
feeds for broadcasters around the world - though the concentration of 
active orbital positions is in the Far Eastern and Central Asian 
regions contingent on former Soviet territories.  Between them, the 
elderly Gorizont and Radugas and the new Expresses are carrying 
customers as varied as Portugal's RTP Internacional, Business India 
TV and others - on top of their primary function of distributing 
television, radio, telephony and data services across the six times 
zones of the massive former Soviet empire.
In theory, the old Gorizonts are to be replaced by Express 
Satellites, the third of which is due for launch "early in 1996" to 
the popular 80 degrees East slot.  Although still some way behind the 
West in terms of payload (offering 12 transporters, 10 at C-Band and 
two Ku-Band) and longevity (five to seven years as against 10 to 12 
for US designs), Express is a much-needed enhancement of the Gorizont 
design, notably in having full north-south spin stabilisation.  The 
older satellites' notorious tendency to drift by as much as five 
degrees out of their nominal orbital position should become a thing 
of the past.
Unfortunately, as a spokesman for InformcosmosConsult, the legal and 
consulting agency for the Russian Space Agency confirms, the Gorizont 
replacement scheme was largely dependent on revenues from the now 
bankrupt Asia-Pacific satellite venture, Rimsat.  When Rimsat's 
payments stopped in 1994, the RSA provided "emergency funding" to 
complete the first Express, launched in October 1994.  Informcosmos 
says it is "doing its best trying to find funding for the Express 
programme... We hope it will be kept alive and we will have some 
successful launches in the future."
Financial problems have also plagued Russia's first DBS programme: 
the original 'Gelikon' scheme from 1989 proposed up to 10 satellites 
to cover the whole of the former USSR by 1995.  In fact it was not 
until 1994 that the first DBS satellite - Gals 1 - was launched, with 
a second to follow by the end of 1995.  The name 'Gelikon' seems to 
have been dropped: no domestic DBS customers have emerged, and two of 
the three high-power (90W/57dBW EIRP) Ku-Band transporters on Gals 1 
were leased to a Chinese broadcaster.  Gals was even moved 71 degrees 
East to serve this client's needs, but no regular services have been 
detected.  As for Gals 2, even an Intersputnik official responsible 
for marketing the capacity was unable to confirm its eventual orbital 
slot - "This has not yet been decided, it will depend on negotiations 
with users."
He adds that "some requests" had come from European broadcasters: one 
of the DBS slots to which the RSA has rights, 23 degrees East, would 
in theory allow a DTH service to dishes as small as 50cm in most of 
Europe.  Gals could also be used for digital services: the first 
tests using MPEG-2 signals on a Russian satellite were carried out 
successfully by the sixth channel of St Petersburg and the Scientific 
Research Institute for Television, Moscow last summer, using 
Scientific Atlanta encoding.  Should the Gals programme take off, 
more capacious, more powerful advanced Gals R designs are ready and 
waiting; on the other hand, observers of past Russian DBS schemes 
would advise against holding of breath.
At least three similar projects have come and gone within the past 
decade: after Gorizon there was the TRomantis' scheme, a Ku-Band 
joint Russian-German joint venture; this, like a C-Band co-operative 
venture with Canada, SovCanstar, came to nothing.  Then in 1993 there 
was GIS Globostar with its scheme to launch up to five 'Coupon' 
satellites offering massive datacoms capacity for Russian banks, and 
steerable, highly flexible Ku-F and spot-beams for any interested 
broadcasters across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  This, which 
would have been Russia's first privately-owned satellite system, was 
backed by banks which have since pulled back; and though the company 
still exists, the Coupons remain 'paper satellites' only.

The inside agent

For broadcasters outside the Russian Federation, the gateway to low-
cost capacity on Russian satellites is provided by Intersputnik, the 
Moscow based 22-nation satellite communications organisation which 
has handled the transition from state agency to outward-looking 
commercial operators more successfully than some.
Intersputnik - which its marketing manager, Hernedo Rodriguez, 
emphasises "is not a Russian organisation, but an international 
intergovernmental organisation" - goes to lengths to make the process 
as painless as possible for its customers, who are, of course, useful 
sources of hard currency.
According to Rodriguez, Intersputnik now handles five times the voice 
traffic it did in 1990, with a 30 per cent year-on-year growth during 
1995.  Television traffic, accounting for 80 per cent of 
Intersputnik's business, fared better still, with an 80 per cent 
growth in 1995.  Overall revenues were 40 per cent up this year as a 
result, he adds:  "We have more than 100 state and private companies 
as users, among them companies from the US, UK, Japan, Canada, 
France, Portugal, China, India, etc."
He cites Intersputnik's "democratic entry procedure and terms and 
conditions of operation, rather low tariffs, a simple and efficient 
system of mutual settlements," and "a sufficiently high percentage of 
the annual guaranteed profit share" as factors which have attracted 
many PTTs and broadcasters to join the group as either full members 
or users.
According to one former Western customer, Intersputnik can even be 
easier to deal with than some of its Western counterparts:  "It was 
pleasantly straightforward,"  says Jim Hodgetts of the Francophobe 
international broadcaster, TV5, which leased a transponder on the 
Statsionar 12 Gorizont in 1992 to reach the former French territories 
of southeast Asia.  "Each year we'd get their typed bill for 
US$1.25m, and so long as we kept paying, any problems we had we could 
put directly to their engineers - it was not at all politically 
secretive."
The give-away here, of course, is the price: as another Gorizont user 
puts it. "You get an awful lot of coverage for your money."  A berth 
on an Express or Gorizont at the most popular positions, 11/14 
degrees West and those around 80 degrees East, can take your signal 
to virtually the whole of the Third World and most of the First and 
Second World too, as Bombay/London-based Asian channel, Apna TV, has 
discovered to its advantage.  Apna is also breaking ground by taking 
the single Ku-Band transponder on the 11 degrees West Gorizont 26, 
giving it enough signal strength to market Apna and its add-on 
Sunrise TV as a DTH service to Asian viewers in the UK and northwest 
Europe, though viewers will need 1.2 metre dishes.One of 
Intersputnik's star European clients is RTP Interna ional, whose 
transponder on Express 2 at 14 degrees West gives it remarkably good 
coverage of territories in Africa and Latin America in one swoop:  
"It's a question of coverage," says Jos Banha Nunes of Marconi SA, 
Lisbon, lessee of space segment for the state broadcaster's 
international service, "but also a matter of price and power.  Using 
the global beam gives them coverage of all of Africa, as well as 
South America and East Coast USA markets.  Downlinks can use TVROs of 
2.5 metres in the islands off the African coast, and 3/4 metres 
elsewhere."
And, as Alexandre Fernandes, RTPi's international operations manager, 
adds, "This price is good - about half the price of the equivalent 
coverage by any other satellite, and the quality is good."  RTPi's 
Express signal is particularly in demand in the former Portuguese 
African colonies, with terrestrial relays, for example, in 
Mozambique, So Tom and the Cape Verde Islands.
No complaints, either, about drifting satellites - but as Hodgetts 
maintains, the Gorizonts' reputation for unreliability had been 
overplayed in the past, perhaps due to anti-Russian prejudice.  
"They're as good as anyone's, they might look primitive, but once 
they're up and made to work, they're very, very solid."
So why, after three years, did TV5 jump from Gorizont to Intelsat 
702?  "We were obliged to move because the new Express would not have 
covered the same area," Hodgetts says: and here he puts his finger on 
the real reason for Westerners' disinclination to use what for the 
most part are hugely cost-effective services:  "The satellites are 
operated to Russian criteria, for the benefit of Russian 
broadcasters."
Intersputnik, in fact, has at its disposal only a small, if 
strategically-important, part of the Russian fleet.  Currently, it 
controls 29 transponders on eight Gorizont and Express satellites in 
Indian and Atlantic Ocean slots, plus the Gals DBS capacity.  
Tariffs, Rodriguez says, are "lower than those offered by similar 
organisations," based on "world average prices," but also on occupied 
capacity rather than number of channels, with discounts for long 
leases. and "preferential tarrifs" for new services.
Back in 1993, Intersputnik's board voted to develop its own 
satellite, Intersputnik VIII, a 24-C-Band, 16-Ku-Band transponder 
craft which it intends to have in operation "1997-98."  With C-Band 
EIRPs of 37-40dBW, and Ku-Band powers of 48-53dBW, the new craft will 
allow use of much smaller dishes for both Earth station and DTH 
reception.  New Intersputnik orbital positions have also been 
notified to the ITU for co-ordination: 97, 83, 32, 23, 16, six and 
three degrees West; and 17, 27, 59, 64, 67, 75, 114 and 153 degrees 
East.
As Rodriguez points out, these "could be of interest for developing 
regional and global projects on a joint stake basis."

STATISTICS

November's inflation rate dropped to 4.5%, after rising to 4.7% in October.
Preliminary data show that December's rate may be as low as
3%.

The ruble lost 1.4% of its value against the dollar.  It opened at 4,580 to
$1 on 12/1 and closed at 4,645 on 12/29.  It is likely that the ruble will
decline sharply in early January as new ruble corridor trading limits go
into effect.

The RINACO Plus RESI index of Russian stocks fell during the month by
several percent.  (Technical difficulties prevent inclusion of
full data for the month.)

1995 AT FIRST GLANCE

Although the results of the Duma elections on December 17 showed widespread
dissatisfaction with the government's economic policies, (see "Duma Election
Results,") there can be little doubt that they produced substantive changes
in economic performance in 1995.

Preliminary data indicates that in many respects the economy improved
markedly over 1994;  in other respects, the rate of overall decline has
slowed considerably.

In the opinion of many economists, the country stands on edge of an up-turn
in 1996: 
                            1994      1995
GDP (%change)                -15%     -4%
Industrial output            -21%     -3%
Inflation                    226%     140%
Deficit (%of GDP)            10%      4%
Unemployment                 6%       8%

STRIKES WIDEN

Strikes began to hit widespread sectors of the economy, prompted primarily
by the enormous backlog of unpaid wages and rising unemployment.

The Federation of Independent Trade Unions (FNPR) called for a nationwide
"Day of Action" on November 30, which brought out thousands of workers.
Demonstrations were held in some cities, but not Moscow, St. Petersburg or
Novgorod.

The FNPR has claimed that workers are owed a total of 13.6 trillion rubles
(about $2.9 bln).  In addition, although by ILO criteria the country's
unemployment rate is 8%, organized labor has charged that the actual rate,
including "hidden unemployment," is 15%.

Trains between St. Petersburg and Moscow, one of the primary freight and
passenger rail corridors in the country, were halted on December 7 when the
Oktyabrskaya Railway said it had no money to pay two months' salaries.

Coal miners, who continue to hold labor actions, have demanded another Rb
500 bln in arrears.  Although the government had just allocated Rb 500 bln
for this purpose, union leaders said the amount was insufficient and wanted
it doubled, to a total of Rb 1 trillion.

Oil workers in Komi and miners in Tula were staging hunger strikes to
protest working conditions as well as unpaid wages.   

As the month progressed, school teachers nationwide went out on strike as
well as air traffic controllers in some areas.  

On many occasions in 1995, President Yeltsin and other government spokesmen
issued calls for wage arrears to be paid, particularly during the run-up to
the Duma elections.  Almost all the back salaries are owed by state
enterprises and agencies.

CBR TO HELP BANKS

The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) may be abandoning credit auctions as a
means of pumping cash into the country's commercial banking system.

A draft document indicates that the CBR is considering allowing banks to use
treasury bills as collateral for repurchase funds.  This is a method widely
used in the West.

The CBR said it would also make special credits available for banks which
are experiencing short-term financial problems.

The number of private banks has declined in the last year, due mainly to
mergers and bankruptcies, and the country's commercial banking system
remains fragile.  With the decline of inflation and the implementation of
the ruble trading corridor, banks have lost the opportunity to earn the
large profits they did in 1992-1994.

PRODUCTION SHARING LAW PASSED

After months of often acrimonious debate, the Federation Council, the upper
house of the parliament, has finally passed a law regulating oil production
sharing agreements with foreign firms.

The law, which was passed by the Duma some time ago, was rejected by the
Council last month, and was heavily amended before final passage.

The revised law requires the Duma to approve each production sharing
agreement reached between foreign and domestic oil companies, limits the
legal recourse of foreign investors to international courts, and gives
Russia a unilateral right of renegotiation should world oil prices change.

A number of pending major deals are awaiting passage of the law, including
Exxon's $10 bln Sakhalin-1 project. Reportedly, tens of billions of dollars
in other investments are also on hold.

Opponents of the Council's version, which was influenced by nationalist
demands, believe that it creates an unfavorable climate for
desperately-needed foreign investments.  There was some speculation that
President Yeltsin would veto it.

Western oil firms declined public comment on the new law, although their
reaction has been reported as being negative.

RUBLE CORRIDOR COULD END

Sergei Alekhashenko, the new first deputy chairman of the CBR, said that the
ruble corridor could end in mid-1996.  Alekhashenko said he was speaking on
his own, and not expressing bank policy.  

Prior to his appointment, he was the head of a think tank associated with
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.

Alekhashenko's views have been supported by President Yeltsin's top economic
advisor, Aleksandr Livshits.

ECONOMIC NOTES

Agriculture Minister Aleksandr Nazarchuk, said that reforms are necessary to
rescue large, inefficient former collective and state farms. He said that as
many as 40% of these farms are "incapable of working efficiently" and that
urgent action, including land privatization, is required to ease the situation.
+++
At present, 136 foreign banks are operating in Russia.  Of these, 10 are
fully-owned by foreign banks, and 50 have mixed capital.

Russian banks have not been as successful in opening offices in the US.
Promstroibank,Incombank and Credit-Moscow have thus far been unable to
obtain permission from the Treasury Department to open offices in New York.
The only Russian bank with US representation is Vnesheconombank.
+++
A study conducted by the Leontiev Center and the Russian Marketing
Association has shown that the country's private sector is performing
much better than the state sector.

Private enterprises recorded production increases of 2.3% in 1995, compared
to a drop of 10% in the state sector.  In addition, after
being adjusted for inflation, salaries in the private sector rose by an
average of 9.8%, while state salaries fell 6.6%.
+++
In the first 11 months of 1995, Russia's foreign trade increased 21%, to
$113 bln, over the same period in 1994.  The trade surplus was $31 bln.

Exports to non-CIS countries rose 28% while those to the CIS fell by 4%.
+++
A survey compiled by the Corporate Resources Group in Switzerland shows that
Moscow is the world's most expensive city outside Japan.  On a scale in
which New York City is 100 points, Moscow ranked 142, just ahead of Zurich
and Geneva.
+++
Russia will impose quotas on the import of textiles from the European
Community to protect its domestic textile industry.

Data released show that textile imports to Russia exceeded exports by $563 mln.
+++
The Ministry of Economics said that it expected investments to grow by 4% in
1996 and rise to Rb 310 trillion ($67 bln).  It expects Rb 50
trillion of this total to come from Russian banks, a figure the Association
of Russian Banks disputes.  The group noted that commercial banks were able
to raise less than Rb 5 trillion to participate in the last round of stock
auctions.
+++
The agreement by which DeBeers sells 95% of Russia's diamonds through its
Central Selling Organization has been extended until February 1, giving
negotiators a chance to reach agreement on a new deal.  It had been reported
that the talks were at an impasse, and that no new arrangement would be
possible before the December 31 expiration.
+++
Russia, Azerbaijan and an international oil consortium have signed a
agreement to transport Caspian Sea oil through a Russian pipeline to
the port of Novorossisk.

The pipeline, owned by the state-owned monopoly Transneft, will go into
operation in the second half of 1996.
+++
Russian computer companies may be experiencing difficulties owing to
consolidations in the banking sector.  This may result in sales and
production slowdowns for the first time since 1988.  For some time, the
primary markets for Russian-made computers has been the banking
industry and state organizations.
+++
Reaction to the Duma elections and uncertainty about June's presidential
elections sent the value of Russian stocks down in trading on exchanges
across the country.  By the end of the month, shares were trading 30% below
their 1995 highs.

Russian and foreign brokers said that they believed buying opportunities
existed, and that stocks could be bought at bargain prices.

STET DEAL OFF

Russia's single largest privatization deal collapsed when Italy's STET
declined to make an initial payment for the 25% stake in Svyazinvest it had
successfully won at auction.

The auction, held on December 1, was expected to raise $430 mln in cash plus
a commitment for an investment of $400 per share over the next 2 years.
STET's winning bid was $630 mln plus the investment promise.

After some initial confusion, during which the State Property Committee
claimed the deal was off and STET insisted it was on, it was
announced on the 26th that the offer was dead.

The committee issued a statement saying, "In spite of the Russian
government's desire to compromise, STET insisted on a form of payment
which went totally beyond the tender conditions."

There were suggestions, which were discounted by outside observers and the
Russian government, that STET pulled out because of the results of the Duma
elections.  Sources close to STET's board of directors said that the company
had reconsidered its bid because it would be unable to realize a return on
its investment until the year 2000.  

A more likely cause of the collapse was STET's reluctance to make its
initial payment until all the details of the transaction had been clarified
by the Property Committee and until the future of Svyazinvest's
relationships with the 85 regional telephone companies it controls were
completely spelled out.

The government announced that it would reschedule the auction of the 25%
stake in Svyazinvest, perhaps as early as January, and would continue plans
to sell a further 24% share in the telephone company.  At present, it is
impossible to say whether the deal's collapse will affect the overall
privatization effort.

DEBT/EQUITY SWAP PROPOSED

The head of the State Property Committee, Alfred Kokh, said that the agency
was beginning work on a plan which would allow creditors to swap their
Russian debt for shares in Russian companies.

Kokh indicated that state-owned shares would continue to be sold in 1996,
including stakes in a dozen major companies, including the insurance giant,
Rosgosstrakh.

At a minimum, market capitalization would have to be raised 10 times in
1996, to at least $60 bln for Kokh's proposal to work.  Kokh said that his
agency's preliminary goal was to raise market capitalization, currently
about $7 bln, some 15 to 20 times, in 1996, allowing the debt/equity swap to
begin in late 1996 or early 1997.

Russian stock prices, due to political uncertainties and charges that the
privatization process has allowed well-placed companies to buy shares at
rock-bottom prices, are currently depressed, and it remains to be seen
whether the government's ambitious privatization goals for 1996 can be
achieved.  

It was hoped to raise $1.9 bln in 1995, but with the collapse of the STET
offer, this goal will probably not be met.

BANK PRIVATIZATION DELAYED

The State Duma passed a law on December 10 postponing the privatization of
former Soviet foreign and other banks.  Under the terms of existing
legislation, these banks were to have been privatized by January 1, 1996,
but the Duma has pushed the target date back to January 1, 2000.

Among the banks affected are the nationwide savings bank, Sberbank, and
Vnesheconombank, formerly Vneshtorgbank.

OIL STAKES SOLD

Stakes in major oil producing companies were sold in December, mostly to
groups of banks.

Stolichny Bank Sberizhni and the unknown Neftyanaya Finansovaya Kompaniya
successfully acquired 51% of Sibneft for $100.3 mln.  The banks' bid was
guaranteed by Bank Menatep, which is a major participant in the acquisition
of 78% of the YUKOS oil group.

NIKoil, a financial consulting firm, bought 16% of the oil giant,  LUKoil.
NIKoil was already acting as a broker for LUKoil, adding to charges that the
auctions were controlled by a small group of insiders.

RYBINSK MOTORS SALE DELAYED

An auction for 37% of the aircraft engine manufacturer Rybinsk Motors was
put back until February because of court challenges to the sale.

Company executives have brought suit disputing the authority of the State
Property Committee to hold the sale, to the declaration of the company's
bankruptcy, and to the inclusion in the company's assets of a fund designed
to benefit the workforce.

The auction may be held as early as February.  Gazprom, the producer of
natural gas, has indicated that it will try to acquire the engine manufacturer.

CURRENCY CONTROLS 


A decree establishing currency controls on the import-export trade is being
considered,according to a report in Nezvisimaya Gazeta.

The decree will require that payments to resident importers be made through
their Russian accounts and that importers will have to produce goods and
records to show that the value of payments and goods imported is equivalent.

This is being done as much to curb tax evasion as it is to reduce hard
currency flight.

EXPORT DUTIES CUT

President Yeltsin signed a decree banning export duties on refined oil
products and lumber products as of December 1, 1995.  

Effective January 1, 1996, export duties on crude oil, natural gas and
industrial goods will be reduced by 50%.

Oil exports, one of the country's major sources of export earnings, fell by
5% in the first 10 months of 1995 largely because of high duties.

REGIONAL LAWS

Regional (oblast) authorities in many parts of the country have passed laws
and regulations designed to fill holes in national laws.

At a meeting of regional officials in Volgograd, various measures were
discussed. The Volgograd Oblast Duma Budget Committee head, Aleksandr
Morozov, said that his body had passed laws concerning non-state pension
funds, the activities of credit unions, and the issuance of promissory notes.

Regional officials complained that federal courts and procurators' offices
were unclear on what to do about such legislation and have not
adapted to it.

REPORTING LAW

Under current law, companies are required to pay their employees' salaries
through a single account, registered with local tax boards and
the state pension fund.

Since a large number of companies have been avoiding pension fund and other
non-budgetary fund payments, the CBR has recommended new
regulations.

The proposed law will require banks to report all new accounts opened by
companies to the CBR within 5 days. Included are budget, credit, loan and
hard currency accounts.

GRAIN IMPORTS BEGIN

It has been speculated for months that Russia's poor grain harvests in 1995
would force it to begin importing large quantities of Western
grain, , as much as 6 mln metric tons. Grain prices, which are near 15-year
record high levels, gained on European and American exchanges amid reports
that Russia had obtained $800 mln in credits to buy 2.5 mln tonnes of wheat.
The reports were later found to be untrue.

The Agriculture Ministry reported that a private company, Roskhleboprodukt,
had purchased $300 mln of wheat from Austria,
Hungary and the US.  The company is said to be linked with one of the
country's major banks, Oneksimbank.

Two other leading banks, Menatep and Inkombank,said that they were "talking
about buying a large amount" of grain, but that no specifice
deals had yet been reached.

The Economy Ministry reported that regions in the Far East had made
arrangements to import 400,000 tonnes of grain through commercial
companies.  These deals, according to the Ministry, were made at the
regional level and did not involve the central government.

While current stocks and reserves will be exhausted by June, estimates are
that the 1996 harvest will recover, and could be as high as 80 mln tonnes.
In the meantime, grain prices on Russian exchanges has remained relatively
stable, at about Rb 850,000/tonne.

REFINERIES TO BE REVAMPED

The Fuel and Energy Ministry will implement a program to modernize its
refineries, but said that unprofitable units will not be improved and may
even be allowed to close.

The Ministry said that the program had been developed in conjunction with
the Ministries of Economy and Finance, the State Property Committee and the
Federal Bankruptcy Agency.

Russia's refineries are in poor physical condition and require massive
infusions of technology and money.  Production fell 17% last year, and has
dropped 38% since 1990.  The average refinery is operating at 65% of capacity.

The Ministry did not say how much money would be made available, but did
indicate that it would come from private and state sources.  It also said
that tax breaks and other "privileges" for refineries would be adopted as
part of the plan.

Refineries who wished to participate in the program are expected to produce
business and technical plans for review.

TIMBER EXPORTS SLUMP

Declining world prices for timber, pulp and paper and the ruble trading
corridor have resulting in a substantial decrease in Russian timber exports.  

It has been reported that in some regions, export enterprises are sitting on
millions of dollars worth of product for which buyers can not be found.
Although the government has tried to help the situation by reducing export
duties on wood and wood products, industry spokesmen have said that
successful timber trade needs an exchange rate of Rb 7,000 to $1, well above
the level of Rb 4,500 - 5,000 which has been maintained since June.

THE DUMA ELECTIONS by Josh Zander

Depending the source, the results of last month's Duma elections presumably
show that either nothing or everything has changed with regard to the reform
process in Russia.

Western news media and, to some degree, the business community, have given
the impression that the strong showing of the Communists means that the
reform process has come to a halt.  Other observers, reinforced by the
government, believe that nothing has really changed and that the process
will continue at an accelerated pace.

Who is correct?

THE VOTE
In summary, the Communists were the strong showers, gaining 112 seats in the
new Duma.  However, the extreme left bloc of parties, including the
Communists, Agrarians, Women of Russia and Working Russia, gained only 58
seats, rising from 100 to 178.  Both Women of Russia and the Agrarians lost
heavily.

The far right parties, primarily the Liberal Democrats and  the  Congress of
Russian Communities (KRO), had a net loss of 7 seats.   KRO, under the
leadership of General Lebed, had been expected to do much better in the
polls, and he is expected to run in the presidential campaign in June.

Most disappointing were the results for the democratic, pro-reform parties:
Our Home is Russia, Yabloko and Democratic Choice.  As a whole, they were
able to gain only 8 seats.  Democratic Choice, which had 76 seats in the old
Duma, will have 9 in the new one.

The election results can hardly be said to contain a ringing endorsement of
the government's policies but neither can they be interpreted as being a
wholesale rejection of those policies.

Undoubtedly, there will be much speculation about the political impact of
the results in the months to come, culminating with June's presidential
elections.  Rather than trying to gauge the political impact, what can the
Duma elections tell us about Russia's business climate in at least the first
half of 1996?

POSITIVES...
The single most important factor is that neither of the two blocs most
opposed to the reform process, the Communists and the extreme nationalists,
have a majority in the new Duma.  

Even allied, which they have not thus far been able to do, the two groups
are far short of the 2/3 majority required to overturn presidential vetoes.

A simple majority of the Duma can pass a no-confidence measure or block
appointments by the prime minister.  It is not likely that the extremists
can muster sufficient votes to do the former.  The Duma's refusal to confirm
the head of the Central Bank for 13 months did nothing to hinder the
adoption of effective tight money policies.

The constitutionally weak Duma can be a thorn in the side of the current
government, but it does not appear that it do it any serious harm.

It must be remembered that 1996 has begun with a budget already in place, a
stabilized ruble, and inflation at the lowest levels since 1991. The country
appears to be poised at the beginning of a period of economic growth.

AND NEGATIVES
The fact that the center bloc of parties did not do better at the polls is
the single most negative factor of the elections.  

The vote clearly shows that a substantial portion, perhaps a majority, of
the electorate do not believe they have materially benefitted from the
reform process.  While the totals may be skewed by the elements of the
population who actually voted and may reflect a nostalgia for the "good old
days," the reform process has been dealt a psychological, if not a material,
blow.

Stock market averages are at depressed levels, down some 30% from their 1995
highs.  Investor confidence, shaken by the vote, is further upset by the
failure of the STET-Svyazinvest deal.  Many potential investors are taking a
wait-and-see attitude, pending the outcome of the June elections.

This will make it more difficult to raise sufficient capital to accomplish
the government's privatization goals.  These goals are not only critical for
the budget, but are the primary means of  modernizing Russia's economy. 

Added to this will be pressures brought by Communists and nationalists to
delay or suspend the privatization of "strategic" industries and that high
prices, perhaps unreasonably, are gotten for what enterprises are sold off.

There will be a greater effort to prevent the kind of "sweetheart" deals
which have characterized many of the major privatizations last year, and
there will be more resistance to privatizing, especially with Western
investment, the military-industrial complex.

At the same time, the Communists will probably make an effort to expand the
social safety net.  Friction between the Duma and the government may impede
enaction of  necessary legislation.  It is safe to say that this friction
will preclude any major legislative actions until after June's elections, at
the earliest.

THE NEXT 6 MONTHS...
To some extent, business in Russia will slow until June, especially as far
as major private investments are concerned.  In light of the STET deal's
collapse, there will be much more hesitancy to invest in Russia.

Russian stocks will probably remain at low levels, if only for psychological
reasons.  While they afford some investors long term gains, it will make it
more difficult for companies to raise capital.

Both President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin have stated that the
government's course will not change despite the election results, but the
results themselves will compel the government to, if not slow the pace of
reform, moderate its worst effects.

Increasing pensions and minimum wages, reimbursing investors of failed
enterprises, and similar measures may be popular and may win votes in June,
but could return the country to high inflation rates and destabilization of
the ruble.

Some of the pressures from within the Duma may result in actions positive
from a business point of view.  General Lebed, the KRO leader, has struck a
very popular chord with his attacks on bureaucratic and official corruption. 

The government has not been deaf to this message.   Any substantive
reduction in Russia's endemic problem of corruption can only benefit
business at every level.

Continued reductions in export duties will benefit exporters and the
increasing number of Russian producers engaging in export trade.  The
government will also be compelled to address the issue of unpaid wages.
This is one of the primary causes of mass discontent. Although payment may
bring inflationary pressure and worsen the deficit, the economy, at least
for the short term, will benefit from the payment of workers in rubles
instead of cigarettes, coal, paper or even tampons.

It is likely that the government will release billions of dollars in
payments for various programs in the defense, lawenforcement, agriculture
and social sectors.  It did this in the weeks before the Duma elections.
While this will exacerbate the deficit, it may help stimulate the economy in
the short term, and some industries will benefit.

It is widely expected  that economic growth will begin in the second half of
1996;  statistics indicate that it has already begun in some industries.

The government will do all it can to accelerate this process, so that more
people perceive a tangible benefit prior to the presidential elections.

AND BEYOND 
Do the Duma elections mean that Russia's economic reform process is in
serious trouble or even dead?  At this point, the answer is no.

It is not in the interest of any of the major parties, with the possible
exception of the Liberal Democrats, to drastically slow, let alone, reverse
the general course on which the country has been since 1992.

In the wake of the elections, it will probably be a tendency of the business
community, both Russian and foreign, to do nothing new;  to wait until after
the presidential elections in June.  

The next six months will be a critical period in the course of Russia's
development.  If the economy can be seen to have turned the corner, if
average citizen can see if he or she is beginning to materially benefit from
the reform process, it will continue at an accelerated pace.

Vietnam: One-year-old duty-free goods entitled to re-export

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) All duty-free goods imported into Vietnam will have to be
re-exported if they are not sold within one year, according to a recent
decision of the General Customs Department which is valid as of September 20.

However, if the owner of the goods wishes to sell one-year-old duty-free
commodities in the Vietnamese territory, a permission from the Trade Ministry
will be required, and then all import procedures and import tariffs must be
obliged.

Those duty-free commodities that have perished or are broken will not be
re-exported, but the clearance of those goods must be certified by a council
comprising representatives from the related customs office, the goods owner,
and the related finance agency.

The regulation also states that duty-free goods may be sold only to visitors
upon their entry into or exit out of the country. After purchasing duty-free
goods exit passengers are required to export all their purchased commodities.

Vietnam: Perfect recovery of footballer Hong Son's knee impossible

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) Following an examination by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
device, Ho Chi Minh City Medical Diagnostic Center (Medic) yesterday said the
injured left knee of footballer Hong Son will never be perfectly recovered.

Doctor Nguyen Thi Anh Hong, in charge of the MRI unit, said that there is a
bruise between the kneecap and the thigh bone and that the vastus medialis
was torn apart.

Son, the hero in the Vietnam-Indonesia match for the bronze at the first
ASEAN Tiger Cup in Singapore, will have to undergo a surgical operation to
have his vastus medialis re-connected, Doctor Hong noted.

She added that he will possibly have surgery on his knee to take out bruised
clotted blood if the bruise is critical.

The date to treat his injured knee has not yet been determined but his broken
vastus medialis will certainly affect his ability to maneuver on the pitch,
Doctor Hong commented.

She noted: "Even if the knee operation is done well, Son's knee will probably
not be completely returned to its previous condition."

If Hong Son cannot recover his health, this will be a big loss for the
Vietnamese football squad in forthcoming tournaments such as the third
Independence Cup in January 1997, Malaysia Open in February 1997 and the
World Cup 1998 qualifying round in March.

Vietnam: VND10 billion in urgent need to save Oceanography Institute

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) Thousands of documents archived at the Nha Trang Institute for
Oceanography, many of them dated back to the 17th and 18th century, have
deteriorated, and Vietnam needs an urgent sum of VND10 billion to save these
precious materials.

According to a survey team comprising representatives of central agencies,
many of these printed resources have become decayed and perished due to
unsuitable preservation conditions. They include scientific reports published
between the 17th and early 19th centuries, historical reports on
oceanography, and other valuable documents.

The survey team is proposing a project worth some VND10 billion to save these
materials, but measures have yet to be disclosed, according to an official
with the institute.

Vietnam: Memoir: A visit to the U.S. (Continued from yesterday)

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Late Gen. Tran Van Tra

New York is a big city, with high-rise buildings, wide streets
and busy traffic. Nights there are wonderful, with bright lights flooding the
streets. However, it looks commonplace in daytime and is not so clean. The
city is said to contain both the good and the bad things of the entire United
States of America. On my visit there, I saw a lot of homeless, jobless and
vagabond people. It snowed on some days but sunshine still dominated our
stay. On the streets, in the universities and at conferences I met many men
and women in casual clothes behaving in a sincere manner and devoting
themselves to their work. Even at the conference where we were the only
sponsored guests, the remainder arrived in their own cars and paid all their
expenses themselves. After the conference, people flocked to a nearby
restaurant for a party. When it ended, everybody except us pooled their money
to pay the bill. At all the parties I attended, they often drank fruit juice
rather than beer or spirits. I do not know whether this is the best way to
lead a civilized and economical life. To be honest, I could not find
luxuriousness, snobbishness, and wastefulness of time and money here, at
least not among the intellectuals I met. Is it because of this that they have
become rich? One day, the Veterans' Association for Peace invited us to a
Vietnamese restaurant for a party which was attended by dozens of people. The
chairman gave a warm welcome to the veterans taking part who later reminisced
with each other about battlefields such as Hau Nghia, Tay Ninh, Binh Duong
and the Central Highlands and military units such as Division 25, Airborne
Brigade 173, Airborne Division 101, and so on. Some American veterans
apologized to the Vietnamese for the crimes they had committed during the
war. A number of others cried in the most sincere and moving fashion.

It is regrettable that due to limited time and the strictly-organized
program, I failed to meet a number of Americans and Vietnamese who phoned our
delegation to the United Nations and to Ms. Jayne, the conference organizer.
I left the country as happy as when I arrived there. The scientists and
intellectuals I met in the U.S. impressed me strongly but much of the country
was still unknown to me. Likewise, I felt so small when I stood by the river,
in the shadow of high-rises, admiring the Statue of Liberty far off-shore.
I could not approach the statue. I still remember sincere friends such as
Prof. Jayne of Long Island and Columbia universities, Prof. Kit of Cornell
University, Prof. Gabriel Kolko and his wife, who drove from Canada to Ithaca
City to meet me and gave me a set of data about the South Vietnam National
Liberation Front. It has the front's flag printed on both sides and was
compiled in London in 1968. Then an American from Canada gave it to me and
I, in my turn, took it to Saigon, now called HCMC. This was a small but
meaningful event.

Shostakovich's 90th birthday in HCMC

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Dan Vi - HCMC

D.D. Shostakovich, one of the leading "birds" of Soviet music, was a
composer, teacher, pianist, social worker and people's artiste of the former
Soviet Union. From 1947, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian
Republic and the former Soviet Union. He was awarded many domestic and
international prizes. He was recognized as a Working Hero of the former USSR
in 1966 and recognized as an artistic academician in Germany (1955), Italy
and the U.K. (1958).

D.D. Shostakovich died on August 9, 1975. He gave the world a precious
musical heritage including  many operas, ballets and compositions of
different genres, the most famous being the opera "The Nose" (based on a
story by Gogol) and Concert No.7 (written at the time the city of Leningrad,
now Petersburg, was under siege).

This year, his birthday was celebrated not only in Moscow, Paris and London,
but in HCMC as well. His life story and a film of his ballet entitled "The
Golden Era" were presented at the Russian Scientific and Cultural House (2bis
Tran Cao Van Street, District 1) on September 22. Tomorrow night, September
25, at HCMC Conservatory, a program of Shostakovich's works will be
performed. This program is co-organized by HCMC and the Russian Scientific
and Cultural House.

Vietnam: New book: "My death begins a new life"

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

Those who died for this country, if there are souls in existence, must be
moved with happiness. They must not feel lonely and sorrowful once they know
that their comrades are still quietly searching the countryside for their
remains. Writer and journalist Nguyen Thi Ngoc Hai reports the stories of
military doctors and nurses and groups of people who have spent decades
looking for their comrades who sacrificed their lives for the good of the
country. People can buy anything with money, except this love, which is
reserved for fellow country people and revolutionary comrades.

The book, entitled "Toi chiet, buat aeiu moat thie giuai soeng" (My Death
Begins a New Life) is evidence of Dr. Tran Van Ban's love for his comrades.
The book tells the story of his long years doing this work and has an
appendix of war martyrs whose remains Dr. Ban has found and returned to the
families.

The book was just published this year by the Tre (Youth) and Haiphong
publishing houses, costing VND12,500.

Vietnam: Company News: Woodprodex in search of investment capital

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Thien Nhan - HCMC

The Wood Products for Export Enterprise (Woodprodex) under the HCMC Service
of Agriculture currently has three production workshops in District 3 and
Binh Thanh District and a showroom at 194 Nguyen Cong Tru St., Dist. 1, HCMC.

Founded in March 1978, Woodprodex specializes in producing high-quality
household wooden products for domestic consumption as well as for export to
Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand. The
European market accounts for 70% of the enterprise's output.

The products of Woodprodex include tables and chairs for outdoor use,
cupboards, wardrobes, carved and plain shelves, etc. They are made from
various kinds of wood such as bung lung, deiu gioa and choa according to
customers' requests.

In 1989 Woodprodex formed a joint venture with a French partner to produce
sophisticated products designed to appeal to the French market. This 20-year
term joint venture has a total investment capital of US$40,000, with
Vietnamese side holding a 20% stake.

A second joint venture was formed in 1992 between Woodprodex and the Scansia
Co. of Malaysia with a total investment capital of US$500,000, with the
foreign side holding a 60% stake. This joint venture focuses on producing
household products. Its duration is 15 years.

These two joint ventures have created 900 jobs for local residents. In 1995
alone, the joint ventures achieved a turnover of US$5 million, 80% of which
came from the second joint venture thanks to its mass production.

In the first eight months of this year, excluding the above two joint
ventures, Woodprodex signed six contracts worth US$430,000 and achieved a
turnover of US$260,000. It is expected that the enterprise's turnover this
year will be double that of last year, and will increase by 50% again next
year.

Director of Woodprodex, Mr. Nguyen Ngoc Tam, said that over the next four
years, in addition to designing new models, the enterprise will pay close
attention to the local market as well as expand its exports to the North
American markets. Woodprodex will also buy some state-of-the-art equipment
and machinery to raise the productivity. At present, to assist it in
developing production, Woodprodex is calling for investment cooperation from
both local and foreign entities.

Foreign direct investment in Hanoi: a sweet fruit with sharp thorns

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Phan Ngoc - Hanoi

"Between now and the end of the year, Hanoi may receive an additional 20
investment licenses with a total registered capital of US$2.4 billion," said
Mr. Nguyen Do Khue, vice director of the Service of Planning and Investment
of Hanoi. These projects, including the US$2.1 billion construction of an
urban area in South Thang Long, have been submitted to the authorized bodies
for approval.

However, they are only prospects for the future as Hanoi is facing
difficulties in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).

When the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) and the State
Planning Committee merged to become the Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI), as in other provinces, FDI flow in Hanoi came to a standstill as many
feasibility studies were delayed by the administrative restructuring. In
addition, some recent changes in Vietnamese investment policy have greatly
affected the flow of FDI in the city.

Around the time of the 8th Party Congress, investors seemed hesitant since
they were afraid that there might be many changes in investment policy. This
indirectly contributed to the reduction of FDI flow in Hanoi, especially in
the first six months of 1996.

So far this year, Hanoi has received 20 licensed projects with a total
investment capital of over US$400 million. Meanwhile, in the first six months
of last year, Hanoi received 30 projects worth US$600 million. Statistics
show that FDI capital in the first half of 1996 amounted to only 20% of that
figure.

Despite great efforts to provide better conditions for investors, the
investment environment in Hanoi is still "very bad", an official of Hanoi
People's Committee commented recently. Site clearing is still one of the
major problems of concerned bodies in the capital.

A number of projects, such as a joint venture hotel between SAS Group and
Hanoi Tourist Service Company, have been held up for four years due to
incomplete site clearing. Another project for the construction of an
expressway linking South Thang Long and Hung Vuong in the Cau Giay area in
Hanoi is at a standstill although Hanoi People's Committee offered a
compensation price of VND9 million/sq.m.

In February the Government suggested that the construction of multi-story
buildings in the urban area should be banned so a large number of hotel and
officetel projects are now blocked.

Hanoi is in an unfavorable position as regards foreign investment; however,
we are still trying our best, said Mr. Khue, adding that further cooperation
with other authorized bodies is required. The target of US$2.4 billion FDI
capital this year is an attractive fruit but one which is surrounded by sharp
thorns.

Current situation of Vietnamese roads

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Nguyen Loc - HCMC

According to foreign investors, the bad road system is one of the things
restricting the flow of foreign investment in Vietnam. However, this is also
an element which attracts foreign investors since it can bring benefit for
those who dare to put money into road construction.

Vietnam has 148,000 km of road network including 14,673 km of national
highways and 14,503 km of provincial roads, the remainder being rural roads.
Only 13.1% of the total network is asphalted. Over half of the national
highways are asphalted but they can withstand only 50%-70% of the required
pressure.

Narrow bridges with a maximum load-bearing capacity of 43 tons and temporary
bridges make up 20% of all bridges crossing the national highways.

In general, bad roads account for 40% of the Vietnamese road and one-third
of these are seriously damaged. This is the major difficulty of the
communications and transport sector.

According to the Ministry of Communications and Transport, a sum of VND33
trillion will be required to upgrade existing roads and build new ones
between now and the year 2000.

Priority will be given to upgrading the 2,289-km National Highway No.1 with
capital mainly borrowed from overseas organizations. In addition, the 25-km
road on Hai Van Pass in the central region and the bridges of Song Gianh, My
Thuan, Can Tho and others are now being constructed.

In the North, the 106-km National Road No. 5 linking Hanoi and Haiphong is
being upgraded and widened to four lanes and is expected to be completed in
1999. The construction of the 40-km Lang-Hoa Lac Expressway has been started
and is part of the infrastructure development program of the capital.

In the central region, work on National Highway No. 14 and National Highway
No. 14B linking Danang and the Central Highlands is also under way. In
addition, investors are now interested in the construction of a Trans-Asia
route linking North Thailand and Vietnam via National Highway No. 9.

Meanwhile, in the South, National Highways No. 51 and No. 52 stretching 83
km from Ho Chi Minh City to Vung Tau are being upgraded and will have four
lanes. Moreover, the construction of a road leading to Phnom Penh and Bangkok
via Moc Bai Border Gate, financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is
expected to start in the near future.

Mr. Hieu also revealed that Gimiko clocks with components from Japanese Seiko
Company are one of the ten most popular products in Vietnam during recent
years and have been exported to France, Russia, Poland and Thailand.

Gimiko now has 16 sales and service agencies nationwide including three in
HCMC. On September 20 the company inaugurated a shop selling Gimiko clocks
and well-known foreign watches at 34 Vo Van Tan Street, District 3, HCMC.

Vietnam: Reviewing the works on fire prevention

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

The HCMC Fire Prevention and Fighting Department last Friday held a meeting
at the City Hall for  briefing on the implementation of Instruction 175/CT
dated May 31,1991 issued by Chairman of the Ministerial Board, (currently the
Prime Minister) concerning fire prevention works during the past five years.

That five-year period has witnessed 1,024 fires killing 65, injuring 124 and
causing damages of about VND52 billion. There was a reduction of  24 cases
(2.12%) but an increase of VND29.88 billion in damages (135.15%) in
comparison with the previous five-year period.

Also in that period, the concerned authorities have made great efforts to
strengthen the fire-fighting force including the 3,405 training classes as
well as the investment of over VND88 billion to equip fire-fighting
facilities.

With the above results, the People's Committee of HCMC, People's Police
Bureau, the Prime Minister and the Interior Minister awarded many medals and
letters of commendation to units and individuals that have contribution to
the fire-prevention and fighting work.

On September 20 the Fire Brigade of the HCMC Police organized a preliminary
review of five years of implementation of Government Instruction 175/CP
issued on May 31, 1991 on strengthening fire prevention nationwide.

The Police Department awarded congratulatory certificates to the fire brigade
sector and the HCMC People's Committee awarded congratulatory certificates
to organizations and individuals who have made achievements in the fire
prevention movement.

Participating in the event were Mr. Vo Hung Viet, Vice-Chairman of the HCMC
People's Committee, Mr. Vo Thai Hoa, Deputy Minister of Interior, Mr. Bui
Quoc Huy, Director of HCMC Police and other representatives of the districts
and neighboring provinces.

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

UNDP and the Dutch government will provide more than US$3 million to help the
province strengthen its public administration system to better meet the needs
of the people. The pilot project - a follow-up to the UNDP-funded Public
Administration Reform Program - will directly support the development of the
Government's national public administration reform program in other
provinces.

"Reforms and governments exist to make  life better for the people ," said
Mr. Morey head of UNDP in Vietnam. "Reforms should not only  be efficient but
there also needs to be elements of integrity, justice,fairness and honesty.
Reforms are  not just about changing and standardizing the rules. It's also
important to  change the   behaviors of those in government to better serve
the people. This conference is a positive  sign from the Government that it
is committed to improving the public administration system in Vietnam."

Vietnam: Increasing rice export quota

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has officially decided to increase
this year's rice export quota to 2.2 million tons, revealed a source from the
Ministry of Trade.

This is an opportunity for commercial banks to pump more capital into
circulation as some VND2,000 billion is still stockpiled at commercial banks
in the country.

State commercial banks loaned VND2,395 billion to rice traders to buy paddy
from farmers in the first eight months of this year, raising total loans for
rice trading businesses to VND4,200 billion, said a source from the State
Bank.

The same source noted that commercial banks are authorized to lend money to
those enterprises which are in need of capital to purchase rice for export
without being restricted by credit ceilings.

It is expected that Vietnam will have exported 2.15 million tons of rice by
the end of this month.

Vietnam to exploit one million cubic meters of wood

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Vietnam plans to exploit some one million cubic meters of wood
next year, of which 650,000 cubic meters come from natural forests and the
remainder from cultivated forests, an official source said.

Mr. Le Dinh Loan, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, said that the country will also plant an additional 500,000
hectares of forests.

The Forestry Development Division of the ministry, Mr. Loan added, has set
out plans to manage and protect 9.3 million hectares for the period between
now until the year 2000.

Vietnam's total area of forests was 9.3 million hectares by the end of last
year. Of the figure, natural forests were 8.2 million hectares and cultivated
forests 1.04 million hectares.

The total area of natural forests is becoming smaller all the time; Vietnam
had 11 million hectares in 1976, but only 10 million hectares in 1980, 9.3
million hectares in 1985, 8.4 million hectares in 1990 and 8.25 million last
year.

(SGT-HCMC) Beta Mekong Fund Limited (BMF) announces the completion, in August
1996, of an investment of US$3 million in Indotel Limited, a company
incorporated in Singapore. BMF is a founder shareholder of Indotel  with AAPC
Asia Pte. Ltd., the Vietnam Investment Fund (Singapore) Limited, Beta Vietnam
Fund Limited and Luculia International Limited, according to a press release.

Indotel has been established to develop, operate and invest in hotels and
related hospitality interests in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.

Borrowings in respect of the Sofitel Metropole, Novotel Danang and Ibis
Haiphong have been or will be provided by the International Finance
Corporation. Borrowing in respect of the Novotel Haiphong will be provided

regional spread of Indotel's properties within Vietnam make this investment
an attractive addition to BMF's portfolio.

(SGT-HCMC) Enhancement of export-oriented industries and other foreign
earners are among major resolutions that Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
suggested to HCMC after his recent fact-finding tour to this southern city.

In a notice just issued by the Government Office last Saturday, the Deputy
Prime Minister urged HCMC to restructure its economy by strengthening export
industries and foreign-earning service sectors.

To do so, the city should encourage projects to produce goods for export, and
to expand its overseas markets. Production firms should be supported in
seeking export markets for their own products, according to Deputy PM Khai.

Urban management is another vital task for the city, Khai insisted. He called
for the city authority to speed up the development of new urban centers and
new industrial zones to ease the over-populated situation in the inner city.

"Concentrated industrial zones must be built outside of the city in line with
the general master plan of the city ... to attract people into new
residential areas," according to the notice of the Government Office.

Relating to the pollution issue, Deputy PM Khai allowed the city to use money
from selling state-owned houses to remove houses along the Nhieu Loc-Thi Nghe
Canal. He also asked the Ministry of Planning and Investment to earmark money
from official development assistance sources to improve the city's
environment.

Other issues that the city needs to tackle are traffic congestion,
uncontrolled inflow of immigrants, and loose management over land and houses
in the city.

Deputy PM Khai also urged the city to mobilize all resources to accelerate
its economic growth rate. In the first eight months of this year, HCMC has
made good economic growth, but signals of economic recession and stagnation
in production have appeared.

* Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh said here yesterday the Government
encourages all people to contribute capital for acquisition of new medical
equipment and for developing new clinics in the country.

Khanh, speaking during a visit to the HCMC Medical Center (Medic), reiterated
that the Government supports this form of investment to upgrade the country's
health care system. "There needs to be a statute governing the operation of
a public-funded system of clinics where all people can offer their financial
contribution," the Deputy Prime Minister said.

The six-year-old Medic has developed robustly since its establishment thanks
to financial support from workers of the center itself (accounting for 70%
of the assets of the center). Some 30% of the center's stake is owned by
other individuals, said Mr. Phan Thanh Hai, director of Medic.

Hai, addressing the Deputy Prime Minister, said that his clinic is providing
health care services to some 1,000 people per day. With higher demands from
the people, Medic's equipment and facilities are becoming obsolete, and need
to be upgraded. "We want to turn Medic into a people-funded medical center,"
Hai proposed to the Government leader.

Vietnam: Stricter measures for import-export debtors

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Five measures to deal with evasion of import-export taxes in 1996
and 1997 will be applied in the near future, according to Circular No. 56
TT/LB issued on September 17 by the Ministry of  Finance and General
Department of Customs.

The measure for strengthening the collection of import-export debt will be
implemented under the form of forcing debtors to pledge to pay stagnant debts
before September 30 or asking the Debt Settlement Board to either collect the
debt or erase it for disbanded enterprises.

The measure of collecting unpaid taxes from bank accounts of enterprises will
be imposed on import-export enterprises unwilling to pay taxes as of October
1, 1996.

Import and export goods will be confiscated when the above two measures fail.

The measure of putting assets equivalent to unpaid taxes as collateral will
be imposed on enterprises which have not paid overdue import-export taxes due
to acceptable difficulties.

The measure of suspending import-export operations will be imposed on
enterprises which have long overdue taxes or have ignored all the above
measures.

Vietnam, UNDP join to prevent HIV/AIDS in nationwide project

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) At present, a two-year UNDP (United Nations Development Program)
project worth US$1 million launched in early 1996 is providing technical
assistance to the Vietnam National AIDS Committee, the National Women's Union
and the Youth Union, provincial AIDS committees and non-governmental
organizations to enhance Vietnam's capacity to mobilize, plan and coordinate
its policies and programs in prevention and care.

According to statistics from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee, as of
Sept. 7, the number of virus-infected cases reached 4,316 including 80
foreigners and 4,239 locals.

Dr.Roy Morey, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative said
that the conference on HIV/AIDS  organized in Vietnam on Sept. 23 and 24
highlights the need to put a special emphasis on today's youth in and out of
school to protect them from this deadly disease.

Since 1991, the Vietnamese Government has disbursed funding for AIDS
prevention operations every year. In 1991, the budget earmarked about VND300
million and increased to VND45 billion in 1995. It is estimated that from
1996 to 2000, annual disbursement from the Government for the AIDS prevention
programs will reach over VND50 billion.

Today, worldwide, more than 50% of those newly infected by HIV are between
the ages of 15-24, and the number of virus-infected cases every day is 8,500.
In many places, among 15-19 year-olds, two girls are infected with the virus
for every boy.

Vietnam: World Bank pledges more loan commitments

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The World Bank plans to offer Vietnam loans of US$1.5 billion over
the three financial years 1997-1999 in the second capital
supplementation from its agency, the International Development
Association (IDA).

The good news was announced by the director of the Asia-Pacific
Department of the World Bank, Javad Khalilzadeh Shirazi, during his
visit to Vietnam last week to review two years of implementation of
the IDA-funded projects and discuss preparations for the 4th
consulting conference of international donors for Vietnam in Hanoi
late this year. During talks with Deputy PM Phan Van Khai, Shirazi
expressed good impressions of Vietnam's economic reform and
promised that the World Bank will continue to help Vietnam settle
debts through the London Club.

According to the International Relations Department of the State
Bank, the World Bank has announced the list of projects expected to
receive its funding in the financial years 1997-1998-1999 with
respective amounts of US$641 million, US$458 million and US$345
million. The projects are related to rural and urban transport,
tertiary education, power transmission, agriculture, energy, water
resources and other fields.

In financial years 1993-1996, the WB approved loans for 12 projects
totalling US$1,275 million with 11 projects already signed,
excluding a rural transport project worth US$54 million under
negotiation. Since October 1993, it has organized three conferences
of international donors for Vietnam with the total loans committed
amounting to US$1.7-US$2 billion each year. Vietnam is now the
second largest recipient of WB loans after India.

Vietnam: Largest BOT investment in power sector

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The U.S. energy company Oxbow International has been selected as
investor of the Hoanh Bo Thermopower Plant (300MW), Vietnam's first
BOT (build-operate-transfer) project in the power sector.

The project, to be built in Hoanh Bo District, Quang Ninh Province
with an investment captal of US$300 million, will use the world's
most modern technology in thermopower production and all the low
energy coal available in Quang Ninh (about 1.2 million tons/year)
as fuel. It will supply power to factories and industrial zones in
Hanoi, Haiphong and Quang Ninh and possibly to southern provinces
of China.

The project is due to start operation in 1999 and will be
transferred to Vietnam after 20 years.

At present, another BOT project in the power sector is under the
Government's consideration. The project, to be located in Ba
Ria-Vung Tau Province, is a diesel-powered plant with a capacity of
120 MW, which will be invested by the Finnish company Wartsila.
Total investment capital is US$110 million.

Vietnam: Preferential tariff for EU imports

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The General Department of Customs has issued detailed guidelines to
implement the tariff reduction for goods imported from the European
Union (EU) in the two years of 1996 and 1997.

According to Circular 2610/TCHQ-KTTT dated Aug.14, goods from the
EU can enjoy import tax reduction if they meet the following
requirements: stated in the nomenclature issued in conjunction with
Decree 18/CP on the list of goods and tariffs to implement the
import tax reduction program for goods imported from the EU,
ensuring the standard on origin in accordance with the general
stipulations of the Agreement on Textiles and Garments of the EU,
and possession of the certificate of origin, form A issued by
competent authorities from the EU.

Goods recognized to originate from the EU must meet one of the
following requirements:

-Wholly produced or exploited in an EU country,
-Produced in an EU country with part or all of the materials, parts
or components completely processed in this country. Textiles and
garments in this case must undergo at least two stages of
processing.
- The final product made in an EU country, in which products
meeting the EU origin requirement have been used.

The circular also states that goods imported from the EU can only
enjoy preferential tariff if they are transported to Vietnam
directly from an EU country or via the ports of a number of EU
countries. The goods can also be transported via the ports of
non-EU countries but the transit is necessary due to geographical
reasons or transport demand.

Vietnam: A proper dose for beer production

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Deputy PM Phan Van Khai requested the Ministry of Industry and the
Vietnam Beer, Liquor and Beverage Corporation (Vinabeco) to
re-organize the chaos in beer and wine production.

During his recent working session with the corporation, Khai
complained that beer factories have been built in many localities
without proper planning and market study. At present, 46 out of 53
provinces in Vietnam have beer enterprises, many of which,
including joint ventures, suffer losses and become a burden for the
State budget. Khai warned that Vietnamese partners must carefully
select foreign partners to establish beer JVs and increase their
stakes in the JVs. He instructed the Ministry and concerned
authorities to prepare  a plan for the development of beer, liquor
and beverage production and to reorganize existing factories,
adding that small and ineffective companies should be dissolved
before licenses are granted to new businesses.

Vinabeco produced 103 million liters of beer, 10.5 million liters
of beverages and 740,000 liters of liquor in the first half of this
year. Compared with the same period of 1995, the beer production
increased by 17 million liters and beverages by 22.1 million liters
but liquor decreased by 97,000 liters. To increase competiveness,
Vinabeco will establish a trading company to distribute all the
products of its affiliated units. It now has 2,091 sale agents
nation-wide with sales reaching over VND1 trillion in the first
half of this year, accounting for 51% of its yearly target.

Vietnam: Trade review after a decade of doi moi

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A conference to review trade activities during the ten years of doi
moi and discuss measures to increase the effectiveness of trading
enterprises and set goals and directions for the period 1996-2000
was held in HCMC recently by the Ministry of Trade.

According to reports at the conference, by the end of 1995, there
were 1,900 State enterprises, 6,000 private enterprises, over 2,000
limited liability companies, 35 joint stock companies and one
million households engaged in trade. However, only 30% of the
enterprises operate at a profit; 40% have normal operations but
with little profit and face capital shortage and debts and 30%
suffer losses. On average, 10 enterprises suffered losses annually
in the past five years.

The goals of the trade sector for the 1996-2000 five-year plan are
to increase sales by 2.5 times compared with 1995 with an average
growth rate of 20%/year, export turnover by 28-32%/year to reach
US$18-20 billion by 2000, and import turnover by 24-28%/year to
reach US$22-25 billion by 2000.

Measures to reach these goals include re-organizing State
enterprises with modern business methods, equitizing part or all of
the assets of these enterprises, defining the mechanism,
responsibility and authority of the State ownership for the
enterprise and upgrading the qualification of sales personnel.

In the first eight months of this year, domestic trade developed
well thanks to an abundant supply of goods which could meet 95% of
domestic consumers' demand. Along with this, price fevers due to
shortage of goods did not occur and inflation was curbed at 2.2%.
However, there are signs of a surplus of goods due to over-imports
and increased domestic production while purchasing power rose
slowly. The trade sector expects to reach total sales of VND180
trillion this year.

According to the Ministry of Trade, Vietnam has trading relations
with 105 countries and territories and has signed trade agreements
with over 60 countries. Trading activities attract over two million
people, contribute to 34% of total budget revenues (excluding
revenues from JVs with foreign partners) and account for 14% of the
GDP.

Vietnam: Press Highlights, September 13-20, 1996

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A weekly review of issues featured in the local press

By TRAN TRONG THUC - HCMC

The first ASEAN Football Cup, Tiger Cup 96, obscured other events
last week as it dominated the front pages of major newspapers.
Readers not only closely read the comments on the Cup by sports
writers but also put football on top of their discussions in
schools and offices, especially the glory and gloom of the
Vietnamese team playing on Singapore grounds.

HCMC-based newspapers, such as Sai Gon Giai Phong (Saigon
Liberation), Tuoi Tre (Youth), Nguoi Lao Dong (Laborer) and Thanh
Nien (Youngsters), seemed to put more emphasis on this sporting
tournament than their centrally run and northern counterparts. The
Tuoi Tre ran the headline "50 Minutes of Collapse, 40 Minutes of
Revival" for its report on the semi-final match in which Vietnam
lost to Thailand 2-4. The Tuoi Tre Sunday featured a cogent
commentary affirming Vietnamese football has attained regional high
ranking status.

The Sai Gon Giai Phong also reported the Vietnamese team's matches
on its front page but printed no comments. Lao Dong's (Labor)
sports section highlighted a long article concluding that the
Vietnamese team showed better performance than it did in the 18th
Sea Games last year. Tiger Cup '96 came to an end on September 15
with Vietnam ranking third after Thailand and Malaysia.

However, the Vietnamese press has made some spontaneous remarks in
a few articles on this sports event. The national team and,
particularly, chief coach Karl Weigang were extolled when winning
but disparaged every time they suffered losses. The Tuoi Tre
published an interview with an indecent query, "Mr. Weigang, when
do you think you will be dismissed?" On that day, the newspaper
received many phone calls from readers in response to the question.
"Weigang has both merits and problems," was the Tuoi Tre answer.
This explanation complies with the contents of a book to be
marketed late this month entitled, "The Unknowns of Vietnamese
Football."

Meanwhile, the lead economic story of the week was an interview
with an official from the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI)
covered by the Nguoi Lao Dong. Headlined "Revised Bill on Foreign
Investment: More Attractive and Reasonable," the interview showed
that Vietnam's law on foreign investment will be amended so that it
will create more favorable conditions for investors. Some examples
of new advantages are: reduced time for investment evaluation,
permission to pool in capital in Vietnamese currency, expansion of
the joint venture form, and elongation of the tax holiday period.

More than one month ago, a Tuoi Tre investigative report on
Vietnam-ese women marrying Taiwanese men aroused public attention.
Last week, the HCMC-based Phu Nu (Women) showed even more of the
bitter reality by publishing an article quoting sources from the
Taiwanese press. This women's newspaper contended that the
Taiwanese story on the service of marrying Vietnamese, and
Taiwanese stipulations on marriages with foreigners are a
humiliation to Vietnamese women. The Phu Nu went as far as
proposing that the law should rule that only foreign men with
adequate health, education and income, and without handicaps are
qualified to marry Vietnamese women. Of course, these are only
proposals for consideration.

Vietnam: Investment Environment Remains Attractive

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Many people have been concerned about the fact that foreign-direct
investment (FDI) has fallen into a decline as the investment
environment has proven problematic while the pressure of
competition from other regional countries has strongly increased.
Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Nhac talks about
this issue.

Could you talk about the situation of FDI since early this year?

By August 20 this year, the Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI) had licensed 186 projects, worth some US$4.35 billion. Of
this sum, the build-operate-transfer project for the international
seaport Sao Mai-Ben Dinh in Vung Tau makes up US$637 million, and
the float glass plant of Japanese Asahi in Song Be Province US$125
million. In the same period last year, total registered capital of
licensed projects was over US$4.57 billion.

So this indicates a slight decline in FDI?

In my opinion, we should first examine whether or not foreign
investors are still interested in seeking business opportunities or
investment projects in the country once the tempo of FDI influx is
mentioned. Between the beginning of the year and August 20, the
ministry received 237 projects, with total registered capital
reaching US$7.25 billion compared with US$4.94 billion in the same
period last year. Currently, many projects have not yet been
licensed as they are big and important; therefore, it takes time to
consider them carefully.

Between now and the end of the year, it is certain that the
government will license a number of large projects such as Dung
Quat Oil Refinery No.1 (US$1.5 billion), Quang Ninh 300 MW
thermo-power plant and a Vietnam-Hyundai ship-building yard. In
addition, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has assigned the relevant
State agencies to map out policies and regulations regarding
several pilot urban development projects with the involvement of
foreign investors such as those in An Khanh, Thu Duc District,
HCMC, and on the outskirts of Hanoi.

I often follow the foreign press and see that some say the tempo of
FDI influx into Vietnam has stayed constant. However, they used
figures of a particular week or month as proof. Several foreign
news agencies have even tried to assert that we plan to reduce the
amount of FDI into the country by inventing statistics which we
have not ever seen before.

Some people are worried that the country's investment environment
is not attractive and is discouraging foreign investors. They refer
to a number of cases including the recent inspection of
foreign-invested projects and the withdrawal of investment
licenses.

It is necessary for functional State agencies to carry out
inspections periodically to find whether foreign-invested
enterprises need any assistance in resolving unexpected problems or
abiding by stipulations in their licenses and Vietnamese laws. This
is ordinary State management work, which foreign businesses are
willing to agree on and cooperate. Foreign newspapers have
mentioned a number of projects whose licenses have been pulled back
before expiry in an attempt to prove that the country's investment
environment has become worse. There is nothing abnormal in
withdrawing licenses from unfeasible and unprofitable projects
prior to expiry. I was very interested in the opinion of an
Australian high trade commissioner in Vietnam; when asked about the
withdrawal of Australian BHP from an oil exploitation project, this
commissioner noted that this is very common everywhere around the
world.

Vietnam's potential rivals from regional countries concern many
people. Could you please analyze the advantages which the country
has in attracting FDI?

Competition has always existed, therefore, we have to accept the
challenges. I think that, at present, the competitive edges which
play the most important role in luring FDI are Vietnam's
development requirements, stability on a macro-scale, and
participation in the ASEAN Free Trade Area. Some foreign
conglomerates, such as Japanese Sanyo and South Korean Daewoo, tend
to set foot in the country as a stepping-stone to expand their
markets to the whole region. They are planning to move their plants
to Vietnam and to export products back to their countries. Vietnam
also has other advantages including low-cost labor and land.

In the future, what measures will the Government adopt to raise the
FDI influx to a higher level?

We are designing policies to attract FDI not only with higher
quantity, but also higher quality. To actualize these policies, the
amended Foreign Investment Law will be presented to the National
Assembly for approval in October this year. This amended law will
contain articles intended to provide preferential treatment for the
State-promoted areas, accelerate administrative reforms, and
improve the investment environment and the efficiency of State
management in FDI activities. In addition, there may be some other
articles stipulating that investors can file complaints and
litigate if Government officials process formalities slowly or
intentionally cause difficulties. I believe that the country's
economic development strategies, legal framework, improved
investment environment, and comparative advantages will certainly
attract the FDI influx into Vietnam.

Vietnam's post & telecom updates

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

* According to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),
Vietnam ranks second in the world in telecom development with a
growth rate of 70%/year. The statement was made after the ITU
completed a comprehensive study of the telecom development
worldwide.

The ITU also reported that Vietnam is the 60th out of 205 countries
which has one million telephones and uses 95% of digital electronic
exchanges.

* According to Vietnamese experts in the post and telecom sector,
to meet increasing demands in the future, Vietnam must expand
operations by fivefold from the present level. Mai Liem Truc,
general director of Vietnam Post and Telecom Corporation (VNPT),
said that the telecom sector must invest over VND3,000 billion to
reach the goal of 5-6 telephones/100 people by the year 2000.

By late August, VNPT had reached one million telephone subscribers,
a milestone marking the rapid development of the telecom sector.
This has made Vietnam an attractive market for international
telecom companies. At present, over 30 of the world's telecom
giants are operating  in Vietnam and US$750 million in FDI have
been poured into this sector.

* At present, there are over one million telephones in Vietnam or
more than one set/100 people. Post and telecom authorities have
plans to increase the telephone ratio to 5-6 sets/100 people by the
year 2000, raising the number of phone lines to 4.1 million by 2000
(in particular HCMC and Hanoi: 20 sets/100 people). Also, in this
period, the fiber optic cable linking Vietnam, China, Laos,
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand will be built and satellite
communications will be expanded with the launch of a telecom
satellite expected in 1999.

Vietnam: Boosting Telecom Service Competitiveness

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Saigon Postel Corp. held a shareholders' meeting to set up the
corporation on August 17, 1996 in accordance with a license granted
by the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee on December 27, 1995.
The corporation's establishment has been given a green light by the
Government, and its regulations on organization and operation have
been approved by the Directorate General of Post &
Telecommunications.

By Minh Trang

The corporation will operate in line with the Company and State
Enterprise Laws, and in the form of a joint-stock company with a
chartered capital of VND50 billion contributed by 11 member units.

Referring to the corporation's trading program in the initial stage
(1996-2000), General Director Trinh Dinh Khuong said that it will
implement post and telecom activities in the first year (1996): The
Co Giang Post Center will be put into operation with such services
as parcel and package delivery and remittance; the corporation will
act as an agent introducing and trading in input-output equipment
(two to three outlets in the city) and as an agent for other postal
services.

The Saigon Postel Corp. will also prepare a design to construct a
telecom-informatics-electronics hi-tech park on a 40-ha area in Thu
Duc District. Later, the corporation will develop two to three
centers with 10-20 branches in cities and provinces nationwide. At
the same time, the corporation will carry out, step by step,
cordless and mobile phone services from Tay Ninh, Dong Nai and Vung
Tau to the Mekong Delta, Hanoi and Haiphong.

In addition, by the year 2000 the corporation will put a joint
venture into operation which will manufacture and assemble
telecommunication equipment with an estimated capacity averaging
200,000-250,000 items per annum, of which 50 percent will be for
export.

The corporation will also take preparatory steps to participate, if
permitted, in the national satellite program and project of
investing in and operating services via satellite.

This is the third entity specializing in the post and telecom area
following the Vietnam Post and Telecom Corp. (VNPT) and the
Military Telecom Co.

Vietnam: Health Care Equality

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The living standards of the people have been increasing constantly
with the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and so has the
demand for medical care. However, can people from different strata
of the population receive equal treatment in health care?

By Phuong Anh

Upgrading medical care

The document "Oriented strategies of medical care and health
protection for the population by the years 2000 and 2020," prepared
by the Health Ministry clearly stated, "To invest in the
population's health is actually to invest in the national
socio-economic development, and we must strive to improve our
people's health to the average level of the nations in the region."

Health Minister Do Nguyen Phuong predicted: In 2000 there will be
419 doctors for every one million people, 700 general hospitals at
provincial level and 10,000 fully equipped dispensaries for
ordinary medical care nationwide, and each person will spend US$8
per year on average for medicine. Meanwhile, the Ministry will
gradually diversify the forms of medical care and treatment with
various types of hospitals: State-run, joint venture and private,
but State-run health care will play the leading role. The creation
of these forms of health care must meet the actual demand of the
population and by no means should health care be commercialized.

At present, there is one private hospital charging low fees in
Quang Nam - Da Nang Province. In the future, there will be more
hospitals of this type to meet the demands of the population. In
the meantime, the Health Ministry is focusing on building two
specialized medical centers in Hanoi and HCM City by decision of
the Prime Minister in July 1995 with the objective to elevate
medical service to the level of hospitals in some countries of the
region.

The specialized medical center in Hanoi, the first to be built,
will be operating late this year. It will receive technical support
from four hospitals and a college; the Bach Mai Hospital for
instance, will assist with laboratory tests, emergency and recovery
and endoscopy.

The specialized medical center in HCM City is also under
construction. At the moment, partner hospitals and colleges are
being selected. Other specialized medical centers will be built
thereafter in Central Vietnam and other economic zones. Yet, the
development of Vietnam's medical system is still inadequate since
it cannot cover every part of the country and big differences in
care and treatment exist between urban and rural areas, the poor
and the rich.

Equality in medical services

Implementing the policy of equality of the Party and Government,
the Ministry of Health maintains three systems of medical coverage:
medical insurance, free of charge, and payable service.

Medical insurance covers only public servants and people working in
some non-State enterprises. Free services are available to certain
groups of people: those having contributed to the national
salvation, and those living in the highlands or certified as having
serious difficulties. Thus, only a limited number of persons can
enjoy State subsidies for medical care and the majority of the
country's 75 million people - most of them are farmers - must pay
doctor's bills. Generally, patients have to pay large fees for
special treatment; for instance, VND 1 million for a liter of blood
transfused during an operation. There are areas reserved for rich
patients in one hospital with good physicians and plenty of
medicines. Poorer patients receive little care at low cost or free
of charge.

From the economic viewpoint, this mode of treatment is fair since,
"the more you pay, the better service you get." This concept,
however, is not fair from a humane point of view so it was decided
to build hospitals for the poor. And the Health Ministry promised
that each hospital will have various forms of treatment but at
least 21% of the patients will be treated free of charge.

Vietnam's medical care must be improved both qualitatively and
quantitatively to meet the increasing demand of the population, the
great majority of which are poor. Since the gap between rich and
poor is widening, small groups of richer people can enjoy more
privileges while the poor especially those in the hinterlands and
the mountains suffer from lack of medical care.

Should medical care be commercialized?

Prof. Nguyen Nguyen Khoi, head of the Artificial Kidney Section,
Bach Mai Hospital remarked: "Medical care must have some economic
characteristics since all modern treatment is expensive and the
patient must pay for the amortization of equipment and materials
consumed. The hospital can recover the capital invested after five
years and the State no longer has to invest in it. However, not all
patients can afford such costly treatment. Therefore, we have to
consider some way to help those who cannot pay. Perhaps, a health
insurance policy is propitious, but it must be suitable to meet the
costs." Therefore, we still have to wait.

Vietnam: PM approves HCMC municipal development fund

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Prime Minister has approved a proposal to establish a municipal
development fund for HCMC submitted by the Ministry of Finance.

The fund is a State-owned financial entity with chartered capital
of VND500 billion, which will be mobilized from revenues from the
sales of State-owned houses, lotteries and land use, electricity
and water surcharges, telephone charges, local budget and
contributions and loans from local and foreign individuals.

The fund will make investments in socio-economic infrastructure
development projects in HCMC and engage in other operations such as
investment consulting services, equitization of State-owned
enterprises and stock exchange. Its lending rates will be set by
the HCMC People's Committee but they must not exceed the lending
rates for medium and long term loans stipulated by the State Bank.

The fund will enjoy tax reduction and exemption in accordance with
the law.

This year, HCMC expects to mobilize VND17,000-18,000 billion, up by
33.7-41% from 1995 and accounting for 36% of the local GDP. The
amount, to come from different sources, including the local budget,
land fund, bond sales, lottery revenues, foreign investment, loans
and foreign aid, will be used for socio-economic development,
especially infrastructure development, which is estimated at
VND3,500 billion. Key infrastructure projects include the Bac Nha
Be-Nam Binh Chanh Road, Nguyen Tri Phuong Bridge and Road, the road
from Ong Lanh Bridge to Hiep Phuoc Industrial Park, the belt
highway over Saigon River to Bac Nha Be-Nam Binh Chanh Road, the
north-south artery, Ton Duc Thang Road and Bridge, and industrial
parks such as Tan Thoi Hiep, Cu Chi and others.

Vietnam: Gov't takes strong measures against tax debtors

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Prime Minister has issued an instructive allowing concerned
authorities to take strong measures to settle the import-export tax
arrears, which has seriously affected collections for the State
budget.

Instructive 575/TTg dated Aug.24 has assigned the General
Department of Customs and the Ministry of Finance to consider tax
exemption or reduction of fines for late payment of taxes for
businesses which have paid the taxes due before Sept.30, 1996.
Regarding tax debt incurred before April 1, 1992 which businesses
are unable to pay (due to dissolution, bankruptcy or losses), the
two authorities must investigate the situation and recommend to the
Government to cancel the debts.

Beginning October 1, 1996, the General Department of Customs will
coordinate with the Finance Ministry and the State Bank to deduct
the balance in the bank account of import-export businesses that
fail to pay overdue import-export taxes after Sept.30 or to seize
their goods for auctions to recover the overdue taxes.

In addition, long debtors of import-export taxes may be subject to
suspension of business licenses, and depending on the seriousness
of violations, may be fined or prosecuted for criminal
responsibility.

When Will Vietnam Have a Well-Built Generation?

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Investment in improving the health of school-age children is a big
concern of every country, with a view to bettering its people's
physical fitness, as well as to having stable human resources to
serve the country's development process. Here are excerpts from an
interview with Nguyen Vo Ky Anh, chief of the Physical Education
Department (the Ministry of Education and Training) concerning this
problem.

Compared with other regional countries, Vietnamese people are much
smaller, shorter and lighter. Could you tell us what will be the
physical fitness standard of Vietnamese in the future, specifically
to the year 2020?

As far as we are concerned, by the year 2000, Vietnamese should try
to reach the average height of 1.65m (for males) and 1.60 (for
females). During past years, the physical growth of Vietnamese has
been strongly affected by the results of a number of consecutive
wars and the country's underdeveloped economy, and thus physical
training has not been a concern. Another reason for the limited
physical development of the people has been low educational
standards and lifestyle; the people lack fundamental knowledge
about the preservation and improvement of their physical condition.
The current physical growth rate of the people has not improved
much in comparison with the year 1943.

In your opinion, in order to reach the above-mentioned standard,
what must we do in terms of physical education?

Initially, we have to educate people about nutrition. In elementary
schools, we plan to bring physical fitness education programs into
the teaching curriculum, and at the secondary level, knowledge of
health will be included in subjects such as biology and citizen
education. We will try our utmost to improve the quality of these
programs.

How about the current situation of the facilities of school yards
and exercise rooms, and the amount of time reserved for physical
education?

It is discouraging for the country's physical education that at the
moment, many schools do not have play yards and exercise rooms for
pupils. The present area of school yards has been increasingly
narrowed or a major part of it has been utilized for economic
activities, building restaurants, clubs and dance halls for
example. The Ordinance concerning the construction of schools with
pedagogical standards has not been properly implemented, so many
new schools are not built with school yards. In foreign countries,
schools must have stadiums and exercise facilities to make sure the
pupils' physical training is not interrupted, rain or shine.

Physical education is now compulsory in schools, with at least two
periods a week required for all levels of education. At the
university level, after four years, students must finish five
credits in physical education if they want to take graduation
exams; elementary and secondary pupils are required to complete at
least five credits.

Teachers play an important role in the improvement of the quality
of physical education. Could you tell us whether the staffs are
professionally qualified?

Only a minority of physical education teachers have been trained in
gymnastics and sports schools, the remainder are mostly graduates
of pedagogical colleges. For the time being, the country has two
centrally managed pedagogical schools--one in Hanoi and the other
in Ho Chi Minh City, three faculties for gymnastics training and
sports teachers at Vinh, Hue and Bac Thai pedagogical universities,
and 16 departments specializing in gymnastics and sports at local
colleges, plus a number of students at the Gymnastics and Sports
University. Every year, between 400 and 1,000 teachers graduate,
but this number fails to meet the current demand. On the contrary,
educational administrators still concentrate more on how to provide
pupils and students with adequate cultural knowledge rather than
physical education. As a result students and pupils may not have
good physical fitness and this is not being given proper attention.
At the elementary level, there are no gymnastics teachers available
since teachers have to cover the curriculum and extra-curricular
activities, and directly manage classes as well. So, it is evident
that right in the first years of school, our pupils are not given
systematic physical education. Gymnastics teachers are not only
unqualified but also there are not enough to meet the demand. On
the average, at all levels of education, one teacher has to cover
2,000 pupils; this ratio at the high school level is 1/300, and
1/200 at the tertiary level. We are now lacking 30,000 gymnastics
teachers.

How much is the annual funding the State offers for physical
education?

On the whole, this funding is too low, making up only a few percent
of that reserved for general training and education. In particular,
no funding of this kind is provided for the elementary education
level.

Pupils and students only have good intellect when they are in good
physical condition. We have developed a strategy for upgrading the
quality of physical education in schools at different levels to the
year 2005. We hope the State will consider it a target to be
urgently met, like many other targets and programs of the
educational sector.

Vietnam: Tales of Mollusks

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Tran Quang Thinh - HCMC

The meretrix, the oyster, the shell fish, and the corbicula were
perhaps well-known long ago but nowadays, not many people know
about these bivalve mollusks.

A businessman specializing in trading in specialty sea food shared
a thought-provoking story about the oc huong (a kind of winkle).
The oc huong, which can be found along the coast from Thanh Hoa to
Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan provinces, has a popular reputation,
especially for foreigners since its flesh is delicious and rich in
protein. Unfortunately, this kind of mollusk has been exploited
carelessly and uncontrollably on a large scale since 1992.
Admittedly, the purchase, processing and export of oc huong have
brought about practical economic changes creating more employment
for laborers but unfortunately, fishermen have been hunting the oc
huong excessively. Consequently, natural reserves of oc huong are
running out and there will not be any left in the future.

On a business trip not long ago to central Vietnam, the author had
a chance to hear about a kind of oyster named so long from a
colleague who disclosed that provincial authorities in Binh Thuan
had put a ban on catching this shellfish from now to July 31,1998.
This was an urgent solution to restore and maintain so long beds
along the coast, which were once considered the "richest mines of
so long's" in the entire country. Because of rash exploitation, the
so long has dropped in number and the supply has been exhausted.
The amount caught per year has decreased considerably: 25,000 tons
in 1993, 20,000 in 1994 and then 10,000 in 1995. Most were  young
oysters. Undoubtedly, the so long is still threatened with
extinction. Previously, authorities forbade exploiting a scallop
named diep in 1994 to 1995 to preserve this specialty.

These examples are not special cases. It seems that people are
always "good" at thoughtlessly depleting resources which appear to
be boundless.

Recently, an alarm was raised about a kind of shellfish named oc
gao in Tien Giang. The yield of oc gao caught this year plummeted
dramatically. There may be many causes but the most obvious is
overwhelming exploitation without planning or control. It is said
there might be a temporary prohibition on catching oc gao soon to
protect this breed, which means consumers will not have a chance to
taste oc gao.

"Will there be any chia voi (pipefish) in the future?" It is said
that if visitors come to Nha Be (a suburban district in Ho Chi Minh
City) and do not taste the specialty chia voi, it means that they
still have not set foot in Nha Be. Demand inevitably results in
supply so businesspeople and processors rushed to hunt for "chia
voi" to the extent that these fish now struggle to survive.

Not long ago the press, especially foreign newspapers, praised a
Vietnamese scientist and businessman for breeding seahorses, so now
demand for seahorses is extremely high. According  to a seahorse
trader whom we met on a recent trip to Nha Trang, about 20 million
seahorses are consumed worldwide every year. They are not "common"
fish. There is no fisherman specializing in catching them. We were
on a boat and its owner, a fisherman, told us sincerely: "Nowadays,
seahorses are becoming more scarce, they rarely run into our net.
It turns out they are becoming very valuable. When catching a
seahorse with its eggs, fishermen used to throw it back into the
sea." But now, hardly anyone will do that since the fish fetches an
excellent price on the market. The market, in turn, influences the
existence of seahorses and gradually, they are becoming extinct.
For that reason, the above-mentioned businessman and scientist in
Nha Trang has begun raising seahorses.

As another businessman told us: "Breeding seahorses is really a
profit-making business." Big profits can be gained artificially,
independent of nature and the seas. But if everyone could realize
this and everyone began raising these fish, what would
happen?

Vietnam: Where to Go for Weekends? Hanoi needs more entertainment venues

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Song Xanh

Along with economic growth, many visual changes have occurred in
Hanoi and other large cities. New houses and buildings have been
constructed and streets have been widened. Hanoians have adapted
themselves to the market economy but now find that they have
nowhere to go for entertainment on holidays or Sundays.

Parks in the past and in the present

Previously, one of the popular hobbies of Hanoians and visitors was
strolling in the park, especially on Sundays, holidays or during
festive occasions. Children and even adults used to amuse
themselves on seesaws, tumbling-boxes, slides and merry-go-rounds
in Thong Nhat Park, which was renamed Lenin Park. They could also
go to the Botanical Gardens or the Zoo to watch elephants chewing
sugar cane or hear the roar of tigers or lions. Now the
deterioration of the parks and the Zoo has resulted in a decreasing
number of visitors. In Lenin Park, some new game equipment has
replaced the old and the games are no longer free: visitors must
now pay to sit on the slow and obsolete planes going up and down,
in the crashing cars or in the train going around in circles. How
about the Zoo? "The animals look so thin, sick and sluggish.
Perhaps a lot have died because I saw many empty cages," a Zoo
visitor said. The green trees, calm lakes and pure air in the parks
are all strollers can enjoy after long hard working hours.

The Hanoi Park Bureau is in charge of flower gardens, street trees
and 47 parks in the city, including 50-hectare Lenin Park and
10-hectare Bach Thao Park which serve over one million residents.
"We cannot meet the entertainment demands of the people because the
Government pays hardly any attention to the problem," Do Duy Vuong,
vice-director of Hanoi Park Bureau said.

Cinemas turn to dance halls

Nearly half of the ten cinemas managed by Hanoi Film and Tape
Company have been converted into dance halls or restaurants. New
names such as Hollywood Club, Centropell, Metal and Com Vietnam Inn
have replaced Me Linh, Dai Dong, Kinh Do and Dang Dung cinemas. "It
is true that people do not want to go to the movies any more. So
cinemas will be converted into 'cultural centers,' including dance
halls, karaoke and video rooms," Nguyen Thi Lien, vice-director of
Hanoi Film and Tape Company declared. Only a few cinemas are still
operational. Thang Tam, the largest cinema in Hanoi consisting of
1,000 chairs, and Dan Chu Cinema can organize projections just
twice a day. "We sell only between 10 and 50 tickets for every
showing at Thang Tam. The reason is that movie-goers' taste has
changed but projection equipment hasn't," Lien added.

The pioneers in modern techniques are private cinemas, including
Fansland, a familiar venue for the youth in Hanoi, which was opened
only a few years ago. Fansland always offers viewers good films
with high quality at reasonable prices. Following Fansland's
success, Hanoi Film and Tape Company opened New Age, an
air-conditioned 100-seat cinema adjacent to Thang Tam Cinema. New
Age often attracts many viewers on the weekends.

At present a Disneyland for Hanoi may be a far-fetched dream.
However, projects to upgrade cinemas, set up new game equipment in
Lenin Park and construct cultural and sport centers and underwater
palaces are being considered. Hopefully, these projects will be
carried out in the near future so that on weekends or holidays
Hanoians or visitors won't scratch their heads asking each other,
"Where should we go?"

Prices at some entertainment venues in Hanoi

Cinemas:
Thang Tam: VND12,000/ticket
New Age: VND20,000/ticket
Fansland: VND12,000/ticket
Dan Chu: VND6,000 or 8,000/ticket

Dance halls:

Royal (Hang Tre St.): US$5/ticket
Hanoi Hotel (Giang Vo St.): US$6/ticket (women free)
VIP (Nguyen Du): US$4.5/ticket

Vietnam: Equity Definition

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

"...First, the general opinion about  "equity" in health care does
not mean "equalization," "being equal," or "equality". Equity means
that those who have more demands are to be given more care, those
who suffer more losses receive more attention; whereas, being equal
or equality means that everybody with more or less the same demands
is to be treated equally. In the first stage of the transitional
period, there cannot be absolute equality but steps must be taken
to realize social equity. Equity also implies that more priority
and consideration must be given to certain classes of people in the
society.

Second, equity must include personal needs for health care when one
suffers diseases or has health problems and the ability to pay.
Although both rich and poor have needs for health care, their
payment ability is quite different. Therefore, equity must
guarantee that everyone's demand for medical examination and
treatment is met. Referring to market economy or services or
purchasing power also means mentioning the ability to pay. At
present, part of the population is unable to pay but still has the
needs, so the public health sector and the Government must take
responsibility to satisfy the mini-mum need of the people for
health care. The general view on equity in diagnosing and curing
diseases mainly has to do with the needs, not the ability to pay.

Third, the poor and those who have made good contributions to the
country  often find it hard to pay. Since they have contributed and
sacrificed a lot on behalf of the nation, the society must
compensate for their losses--that's a return for gratitude, not
charity. For this reason, the Government and the public health
sector must give more consideration to these people to maintain
social equity.

Fourth, the view on equity in health care shows that the normal
citizens, the poor, and those who are good contributors to the
country are completely entitled to medical care, not that they beg
for merciful treatment, pity, compassion or favor. As the Law on
Health Care for the Population says, everybody is entitled to
medical care. The Government and the public health sector must
therefore socialize the activities concerning health care and
protection for the citizens. The conditions required for winning
social equity are that the Government must seriously consider
investment in the public health sector and must be able to
calculate prices of the public health services to give good
services without making a profit. The ability of people to pay for
public health services in the market economy depends upon the
purchasing power of each person and the prices. The Government must
not only know the cost and be able to calculate the prices for
services but must also offer certain kinds of medicine to patients
free of charge. The Government must incur some financial losses in
order to help the common people. Equity must be accompanied by
medical morals, requiring a high sense of responsibility of the
doctors toward their patients and the same treatment for both rich
and poor patients."

Vietnam: Reaching higher

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A survey of 1,149 students of Hanoi Medical University, aged 17-24
(629 males and 520 females) shows that the height of students still
continues to increase after puberty in both sexes: males reach top
height at the age of 24 (164.29cm), and females at 21 (155.56cm).
There is a distinct increase compared with Vietnamese young people
of 10 years ago, and particularly 20 years ago; today's males'
heights have increased by 4.95cm while females' are taller by
5.46cm. However, surveys conducted in some localities also show
that pupils in municipalities and cities have better health than
those in the countryside, in particular, the number of pupils
feeling exhausted after a day at school makes up a high proportion
(1/3-1/4). In an urban district of HCMC, up to 25% of pupils have
bad health due to malnutrition.

Vietnamese Income Survey

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Tran Hung

Vietnam has maintained a high economic growth rate. However, what
is the average per-capita income in Vietnam at present and how does
the country's high economic growth affect workers' incomes?
In the first half of this year, the average monthly income per
capita of State sector workers was VND472,800 and gross domestic
product averaged US$516 per capita, according to statistics from
the Information Center under the Ministry of Planning and
Investment. Nevertheless, there was still a gap in earnings between
the central and local levels - VND616,000 and VND366,800
respectively.

The areas in which State workers were highest paid - over
VND800,000 per month - include electricity-water supply with
VND827,200, and post-communications and finance-banking with
VND814,100.

In the first six months of this year, the income discrepancy
between the central and local levels was broad in the three above
areas: VND900,000 compared with VND542,700 in the electricity-water
supply sector; VND900,000 with VND439,000 in the
post-communications sector, and VND820,000 with VND610,200 in
finance-banking.

Such industries as oil and coal followed with incomes averaging
VND799,300 per capita per month, in which the centrally governed
area attained VND850,000 and the locally governed, VND454,500. This
is paradoxical although oil and coal are Vietnam's key exports.

However, the income of workers at the central level was lower than
that at the local level in two of the 18 areas surveyed, namely
fisheries, VND301,000 compared with VND420,400, and
hotel-restaurant services, VND520,000 with VND616,600. Meanwhile,
the areas in which the monthly per-capita income was equal at both
levels included science (VND362,000) and health (VND350,000).

Alongside the scientific and health sectors, those working in
culture and sports also received a low monthly income, on average
VND347,000. The salary of those who work in the educational sector
were even lower in the 18 surveyed areas in the country, averaging
VND316,000 per capita, in which the income at the central level was
VND399,000 and that at the local level VND310,500.

The above figures are just references as are all statistics
released by the General Department of Statistics and the Ministry
of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs. At present, people
prefer working in such areas as trading, services, restaurants and
hotels.

The incomes of workers in the foreign-invested and private sectors
have not yet been surveyed; therefore, an overview of personal
income throughout the country has not been done. According to the
World Bank and United Nations Development Program, the annual
income in Vietnam is now US$700 per capita; particularly, Ba
Ria-Vung Tau Province has attained an average income of US$1,100,
Ho Chi Minh City US$1,000 and Hanoi US$800.

Vietnam: Gourds Reach Foreign Markets

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Environmentally-friendly luffas, which are often used for cleaning
saucepans by Vietnamese housewives, are now popular on the world
market for their newly-discovered uses.

By Pham Hong Van

It is surprising that Vietnamese luffas have appeared on the
counters of big supermarkets in Western Europe. In addition, they
are used as ornaments in restaurants, as bathing sponges instead of
brushes in hotels, and for physical therapy in hospitals.

The luffa products are produced in An Giang Province by two joint
ventures: An Giang Agro-Product and Foodstuff Import-Export Company
(AFIEX Co.) and International Foodstuff Company (IFC).

At present, farmers in An Giang are financed by AFIEX Co. to grow
gourds for fiber. The seeds are from the Philippines, and can be
harvested after three months with 15,000-20,000 gourds per hectare.
The gourd fruit can reach 0.8-1 meter long each but cultivation is
not simple: Farmers must be experienced in growing local gourds;
frames for the plant to climb must be well built; insecticides must
be applied during the flowering period and gourd plants should be
fertilized at least three times a month.

According to the Filipino agricultural experts who are guiding
farmers in An Giang, this kind of gourd is suited to the soil here.
If well-cultivated, it can be harvested three times a year with the
number of fruits beyond prediction. Over-three-kilo gourds are
soaked in water before their flesh is extracted. Then the luffas
must be dried in the shade (they can be broken if dried in
sunlight) for four days. After that they are brought to factories
to be whitened before processing into various products: ornaments
(luffas are cut into small pieces for artisans to assemble) or
bathing sponges in round, triangle or oval shapes or belt-shaped
for back rubbing or for dish-washing. Finished products are
exported to Western Europe at US$0.8-1.3/item, or higher according
to orders and are most popular with overseas Vietnamese, especially
in the U.S., Canada and Australia.

To date, more and more foreigners tend to use luffas because of the
current trend of using natural products to avoid skin allergies.

Big hotels in Ho Chi Minh City such as New World, Rex and Majestic
are using luffa products to replace brushes. Some Asian markets are
also interested in these products.

Currently, Tri Ton, Chau Phu, Cho Moi and Phu Chau districts of An
Giang Province are cultivating the Philippine gourd supplied by
AFIEX Co. Farmers are provided with seeds and fertilizers; when
harvested, a category one dry luffa with a minimum length of 0.8m
sells for VND3,000; category two at VND2,000 and category three at
VND1,000. Growers can earn VND15 million per hectare on average.

What has been done in An Giang so far is just a trial step. If all
goes well, gourds will be grown in many other provinces and the
value will increase.

Luffa, once used to wash pots and pans or dishes, is now diversely
used and is valuable on the world market. Doing business in the
time of market economy is full of interesting opportunities.

Vietnam: Stone Handicrafts on Show Abroad

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Tourists to the famous Ngu Hanh Mount, Quang Nam-Da Nang Province,
all like to buy Non Nuoc stone handicrafts as souvenirs.

By NGUYEN DINH LAC - HCMC

It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that a
village specializing in stone devices such as stone pestles,
mortars, and chopping blocks was formed at the foot of Ngu Hanh
Mount. The first copies of Cham statues carved of Non Nuoc stone
were made to meet some French orders. But to the year 1975, the
activities here had not developed with only some small villages
producing simple handicrafts such as stone ashtrays, mortars,
bracelets, and lion statues. However, since 1985, the shift of
local fishermen to this career has brought new beauty and style to
stone products. And since 1990, Non Nuoc handicrafts have found a
position on American, French, Canadian, and Hong Kong markets.
Graduating from an art course in the army in 1988, Nguyen Long Buu
is among the rare trained artists of the young generation in the
stone handicraft-making village. On his return after his military
service, he created many products just for fun until 1993 when his
piece Nguong Vong was bought for a high price by an Australian.

Since that turning point, Buu has shifted to making statues for
home and garden decoration and many of his products have been sold
to foreigners. In the last two years, Buu has been invited to build
monuments in Gia Lai, and Buon Ma Thuot. He is now preparing for an
exhibition in Singapore sponsored by the Happy Wear International
Co.Ltd (Taiwan). This is the first time Non Nuoc stone handicrafts
will appear in an international statue exhibition with 20 carvings
by Nguyen Long Buu; the shortest height is 0.30 meters, and the
highest 1.20 meters.

The long-nurtured dream of Buu now is to make a bust of Uncle Ho in
Pac Bo.

Vietnam: Dong or U.S. dollar?

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

I work for a foreign-invested company in Vung Tau. According to
Vietnamese labor regulations, the wage of an employee must be
specified in the labor contract. Should this wage be expressed in
U.S. dollars or Vietnamese dong? Does the law of Vietnam have any
articles dealing with this issue?

Le Duc Thuan - Vung Tau

According to Article 5 in Decree 197-CP dated December 31, 1994 of
the Government and Circular 11-LDTBXH/TT dated May 3, 1995, the
employer may choose the mode of payment to suit the labor
conditions and production activities of the enterprise, but this
choice must be expressed in the collective labor agreement and
labor contract. Wages paid to Vietnamese employees must be in
Vietnamese dong at the U.S. dollar exchange rate fixed by the State
Bank at the moment of payment.

Vietnam: Compensation for Labor Accidents

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The last sanction  for labor violations says, "Any employer who
fails to meet labor safety measures will be fined VND10 million."
In some cases, however, the violation can cause death for workers.
So is 10 million enough to warn any boss who knows this violation
quite well but ignores it and indirectly causes a casualty?

Truong Quang Hung - Qui Nhon

According to Article 11 in Government Decree 06/CP dated January
20, 1995, the employer must compensate the payment of at least 30
months' wages for employees who lose over 81% of their working
ability or for relatives of those who die of accidents. If
accidents are caused by employees' errors, they are also supported
by the employer with the payment of at least 12 months.

Vietnam: Largest shipbuilding JV licensed

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The first and largest foreign-invested shipbuilding project in
Vietnam received a license from the MPI last week.

The Hyundai-Vinashin Co.Ltd. is a 30/70 JV between Vietnam
Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (Vinashin) and four companies
affiliated with Hyundai Corp. (South Korea) with a duration of 50
years. The first phase of the project, capitalized at US$95.4
million, involves building a shipbuilding factory in Ninh Phuoc
Commune, Ninh Hoa District, 55 km from Nha Trang City, which will
repair 100 ships of up to 120,000 tons and build five new ships of
up to 80,000 tons/year. In the second phase, US$300 million will be
invested in developing the Hyundai-Vietnam Industrial Complex to
produce steel, oil and gas exploitation facilities and diesel
engines.

Vinashin is seeking partners to repair and upgrade its shipyards in
order to increase the total capacity of the national fleet to 1.5
million tons by the year 2000. Established in January this year, it
is one of the largest companies of Vietnam's maritime industry with
22 affiliated units. Between now and 2010, the company will try to
modernize technology and build new ships of 10,000 tons, container
vessels and military ships and develop three shipbuilding centers
in Vietnam.

There are 60 ship repair and building factories in Vietnam but only
two can build ships of up to 15,000 tons, two others can build
ships of up to 3,000 tons and the remaining can repair and build
ships of under 1,000 tons.

According to the development plan for the shipping fleet to 2010,
Vietnam needs over US$500 million to increase the DWT of its
shipping fleet to one million tons by 2000, and US$3 billion to
reach the targets of 3.5 million tons by 2005 and six million tons
by 2010.

Vietnam: Privileges offered to workers in equitized SOEs

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Workers in equitized enterprises can hold stakes equivalent to 25%
of the enterprise's assets, according to a circular on financial
issues, sales of shares and interests of workers in equitized State
enterprises.

Circular 50TC/TCDN issued by the Finance Ministry states that the
equitized State-owned enterprise (SOE) is allowed to offer 10% of
its asset value in shares to workers depending on seniority and
individual performance. The value of the shares for each worker
must not exceed six months' salaries. These shares are ordinary and
State-owned and the worker can enjoy dividends until the end of
his/her life.

The circular also states that the equitized enterprise can sell 15%
of the value of its assets in shares to workers on credit, but the
total value of these shares must not exceed the value of shares
bought in cash by the workers at the enterprise. Workers can enjoy
dividends of the shares bought on credit on a yearly basis, but
each year they must repay at least 20% of the value and 4% of the
interest on these shares. If they fail to pay the loans in two
consecutive years, they must return the shares to the State. Also,
they cannot inherit, sell or mortgage the shares if they have not
paid in full the amount owed.

In all, workers at equitized enterprises can hold shares equivalent
to 25% of the value of the assets of the enterprise. However, only
those who are on the payroll and work for over three years by the
time of equitization and will continue working thereafter can enjoy
these privileges.

The equitized enterprise can only sell shares after competent
authorities have appraised its assets and determined the value of
the assets allowed to be sold or the funds to be mobilized. Also,
it must announce at least three times on the mass media the total
value of assets, the amount of shares to be sold, those allowed to
buy shares, time of issue and profit margin of the three previous
years.

Recently, Minister and Director of the Central Steering Committee
for Equitization Phan Van Tiem signed Decision 01/CPH on the
procedure to turn SOEs into joint stock companies. Accordingly,
there are four steps for SOEs to proceed in turning into joint
stock companies: Preparation for equitization, drafting the
equitization plan, approval and development of the plan, and
inauguration of the joint stock company and business registration.

Equitized SOEs are divided into two categories: Those with capital
of over VND3 billion and those with capital under VND3 billion. The
equitization board of the SOE must publicly announce the financial
standing of the enterprise before proceeding with equitization and
the sales of shares as well as the organization of registration for
share buyers.

In the two years of 1996 and 1997, the Government expects to
equitize 150 State enterprises, of which each ministry, province or
city will have 2-4 enterprises to be equitized, and to sell shares
of State enterprises to foreign buyers on a pilot basis.

Vietnam: The Path of AIDS

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

In December 1990, the intelligentsia in Ho Chi Minh City was
stirred by the first detection of an HIV-positive case in Vietnam.
A Vietnamese girl residing in the city tested positive with the HIV
in her blood when she took a health examination to go abroad with
her fiance.

By Thuc Doan - HCMC

More than five years have passed. People have forgotten the story
but the girl has to work and live day and night haunted by the
virus that causes AIDS.

In 1990 and 1991, only one HIV-infected case was found. The next
year, 1992, twelve cases were detected, but in 1993 the number of
patients soared to 1,000 nationwide. Over the past three years, the
HIV virus has taken the lives of 329 Vietnamese.

A source from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee indicated that,
as of Sept. 7,1995, the number of virus-infected cases reached
4,316 including 80 foreigners and 4,239 locals. Of them, 508 people
have been diagnosed as AIDS patients.

Meanwhile, to August 30, results from the program on epidemic
control showed that the southern cities and provinces account for
3,516 HIV-infected cases, with 1,741 cases detected in HCM City.

According to Mr. Dang Van Khoat, chief of the Information Center of
the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee, AIDS in Vietnam is
developing more slowly than in other Asian nations. "AIDS has not
yet knocked at every door as seen in some parts of the world,"
Khoat said.

Officials from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee said that
although the number of HIV-infected cases in the country is not
high compared with other countries in the Asian region, the virus
has became dangerous to Vietnamese people. The available figures do
not reveal exactly the number of HIV-infected people in the
country, according to an AIDS expert. "They are just statistics
from the annual result of the program on epidemic control and test
results from blood-donors," he said.

Dr. Le Hoang Son of the HCMC AIDS Prevention Committee said that
the number of HIV-infected people in HCMC could reach an alarming
20,000 case-mark if comprehensive tests are available to the city's
population. "The infection rate of HIV-virus varies by social
class," Son said. To date, in Southern cities and provinces, 18
pregnant women, four children and 116 normal citizens who do not
belong to the high-risk groups are HIV patients.

At first, the increase of HIV-infected cases was mainly among drug
addicts. However, in recent years, the number of people infected
with the virus due to sexuality has doubled annually. According to
statistics from the HCMC AIDS Prevention Committee, the ratio of
HIV-infected cases of prostitutes was 0.47% in 1993, 0.62% in 1994,
1.07% in 1995 and up to 1.17% in the first six months of 1996. As
of August 30, there were 242 HIV-infected prostitutes in southern
provinces, 6.72% of the total cases.

Experts from the AIDS Prevention Committee said that Vietnam is now
where Thailand was seven years ago. The country is facing on AIDS
threat as the number of AIDS-related deaths grows significantly
although the Government has spent large sums on AIDS prevention
programs implemented since 1990. In HCMC, the local budget earmarks
over VND 3 billion for AIDS prevention operations every year.

HIV-Infected patients' lives

The world's most famous HIV patient, basketball superstar Magic
Johnson, made a comeback after announcing in 1991 that he was
retiring from basketball because he was infected with HIV.
Meanwhile, he isn't waiting for a cure, he's too busy living. In
most cases, Vietnamese HIV patients are not so fortunate as
Johnson. They often live all day long haunted by the HIV without
love from their families. Some patients show resentment against the
virus which "sows" its "dead seedling." Their fights against this
deadly disease are courageous as they understand that Vietnam
cannot afford to import expensive drugs to help AIDS patients live
longer. Overcoming the fear, HIV patients have gathered together to
establish a "friends help friends" group. The group belongs to the
HCMC Health Center and operates with the purpose "building good
relationships among HIV-infected patients who need sympathies from
others."

The "Friends Help Friends" group has 70 volunteers to care for AIDS
patients under treatment at Binh Trieu Hospital. Phung, a member of
the group said, "I help these patients because I need love and
sympathy from society. I wish my remaining days to be
meaningful."

At present, many clubs of HIV-infected patients have been
established in the country as well. AIDS patients come together
because they don't want to be overwhelmed by loneliness.

INTERLINE BAGGAGE TRANSFER ENTERS PAS 103 EQUATION

Bags from other airlines may have been transferred to Pan Am flight
103 at Heathrow, Interpol sources have told CT, thus complicating the

investigation which has previously focussed on baggage originating in
Frankfurt on Pan Am's own system. Interline transfer of "a few bags"
could vastly expand the number of potential entry points for the bomb
since it is now considered possible that the bomb was never in Frankfurt.

Interpol officials expressed surprise at a West German news report
claiming the Irish Republican Army put the bomb aboard the aircraft
as a cooperative operation with a Middle Eastern group. Interpol said
"educated speculation" now indicates a cooperative operation between
Middle Eastern groups, either a Palestinian splinter group out of
Lebanon or Iranian factions.

Further tests of the residues are being made to confirm initial belief
that it was Czech-made Semtex plastic explosive which made up the
bomb. Several national police services are running similar materials
past their detector devices and sniffer dogs to see how they do in
detecting it. FBI bomb and explosives experts are continuing to
examine information to get as complete a picture of the bomb as possible.

STRANGE WARRANT ISSUED IN CITY OF POROS ATTACK

Greece has issued an arrest warrant for a man apparently killed in the
11 July attack on the tourist cruise vessel City of Poros near Piraeus.
The district attorney issuing the warrant gave no explanation for
naming Mohammed Adnan Zozad, 21, as a fugitive despite an earlier
police report saying the Lebanese national had been killed in an
explosion aboard the vessel and part of his leg had been found. Either
the government now believes the police report to be mistaken or the
warrant may serve some legal purpose despite Zozad's death.

Absent from the warrant is any mention of Laurent Vigneron, 23,
whom eight witnesses identified as one of the attackers. He was
reported to be firing a submachine gun at passengers, but when Greece
named him as a terrorist, the French government protested that he
was merely on vacation. Others involved have been named by Greece
and they include ringleader Mohammed Khadar, AKA Hejab Jaballa, a
Libyan passport holder who has been linked to Abu Nidal. He is
believed to have been killed when a car bomb he was delivering
apparently exploded prematurely near a marina shortly before the
cruise ship was to dock.

Greece believes the goal of the attack was to force release of Abdel
Osama Zomar, jailed in Athens awaiting extradition to Italy for his
role in a Rome synagogue attack that killed a child in October 1982.
Zomar was deported by Greece, but not to Italy. He was sent to a
country of his choice last month: Libya.

FAA ISSUES AIRPORT ACCESS REGULATIONS

On 4 January the US Dept of Transportation finally issued its long-
awaited airport access control rule, requiring airports by 8 February
to begin compliance. About 270 airports are required under the rule to
install computerized security systems or equivalents, with larger
airports having 24 months to comply and smaller facilities up to 42
months. A seminar will be held in Washington, DC, in mid-February to
discuss the rule and its application.

AOCI has sharply protested the rule, especially on grounds of its cost.
Deborah Lunn, acting executive director of the Airport Operators
Council Intl, said FAA has drastically underestimated the cost to
airports of installing the systems required. Lunn pointed to an
unobligated $6 Billion aviation trust fund and the FAA's failure to
provide any source of funding for the security improvements,
contrasting these with an industry-estimated pricetag three times
the estimate of FAA. This "will require airports to turn to the local
taxpayer or to divert grant funds that had been planned for other
projects," she said. FAA estimates the requirement will cost about
$119.1 million over a ten-year period and Lunn said it's possible that
price could apply to one or two major airports. The AOCI estimates
range from a low of $161.9 million to $800.5 million.

Industry had proposed a pilot program to determine the most
effective way of addressing the access control problem, but FAA
rejected this approach. In fact, FAA rejected virtually every
suggested change to the rule as it was proposed by the federal agency,
except for minor modifications to deadlines. FAA rejection of the
comments made by industry was explained away by "numerous
commenters ... made incorrect assumptions about the scope of the rule."

AOCI is considering a lawsuit over the rule, insisting that FAA is
blowing a smokescreen when it says the rule is being misconstrued.
The industry group feels its interpretation is accurate and cited four
major concerns in the final rule:

* FAA said to define the term 'secured areas' in the rule would
compromise airport security programs. AOCI says this leaves the
term legally undefined.
* FAA used the word 'immediately' to describe when requiring the
speed at which a dismissed employee's access must be denied. AOCI
says that is not acceptable, although FAA counters that it is meant
merely to convey the sense of urgency involved.
* AOCI says general aviation and other tenants are subject to the
airport's rules and enforcement, not the FAA's, and this leaves a huge
gray area of how to comply with the published access control rule.
* FAA refuses to specify the types of doors to be fitted with
enhanced controls. "To do so," said the agency, "would compromise the
airport security program. FAA does not envision that every door ...
will need the enhanced access controls." AOCI notes this leaves the
airport in a catch 22 situation.

It is unlikely FAA will budge in light of the hearings where 60
aviation organizations testified and had little effect on the agency's
proposed rule. AOCI may well take the matter to court for judicial
relief. Congressional intervention is unlikely because of the
implications any politician would sense in "weakening" security.

PRO-FILE: ETHNIC KURDS SPAN FIVE NATIONS

Strewn over the territory of five nations are the ethnic Kurds, who
have struggled to achieve an independent state for years. They have a
history of armed conflict with various rulers and live in mountainous
portions of eastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, northern Iraq,
northwestern Iran and even parts of south-central Russia. The most
recent upsurge in violence occurred with the 1979 Islamic revolution
in Iran. That event sent many Kurds from northwestern Iran to camps
in Iraq and Turkey.

Kurds were prime suspects in the assassination of Swedish prime
minister Olof Palme, and they have been active in western Europe as
assassins of political enemies.  Various Kurdish groups have bombed
embassies and government offices. It is puzzling, in light of this, that
the just-released Defense Intelligence Agency booklet on terror
groups makes no mention of the Kurds.

August 15, 1984, marked the beginning of a wave of violence by one of
the most militant of Kurdish organizations, the PKK, and the campaign
continues to this day  On that 1984 night, the PKK (Kurdish Workers
Party) launched a coordinated series of attacks on Turkish police
stations in the eastern part of the country. Since then, guerrilla
warfare on a limited scale has existed between Kurds and Turkish
security forces. Ironically, it was Turkey that was originally the
most helpful nation to the Kurds when they became refugees from Iran
and Iraq.

PKK is the largest and most militant of Kurdish organizations. It is an

amorphous group with 2000 to 3000 militant members led by
Abdullah Ocalan. The Partisan Group, headed by Hussein Yildirim, has
about 1000 to 1500 militant members. There are two smaller
movements, each with several hundred followers. The groups function
as political parties in exile, counting thousands of general members.
However, only a limited number of those are military activists who
could be called terrorists or guerrillas. Previously unknown Kurdish
Liberation Army was first heard from in December 1988 when it
assassinated a political activist in Hakkari.

By far the most active and militant group is the PKK. It is an
enigmatic organization with vague socialist-separatist roots, headed
by a council which often changes location around the Turkish-Iraqi
border area. Its organization. Well-established and run somewhat like
the PLO, the PKK has numerous foreign branches, committees and
services. In recent years PKK cells have become well established in
western Europe, particularly in large emigre communities in cities
like Amsterdam, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Zurich. Although it raises
money and conducts gunrunning and retaliatory operations far afield,
PKK keeps its organizational center-of-gravity in the tri-state area
of Turkey-Iran-Iraq that it considers its homeland.

PKK operations in Turkey have been the centerpiece of its activities
since 1984 and represent a clear shift away from Iran and Iraq. The
PKK activity has far surpassed that of the Armenian group, ASALA, in
frequency if not in dramatic impact. One of the most frequent of PKK
operations is the 10-to-20-man ambush against security patrols by
Turkish forces. Weapons are usually Kalashnikovs and grenades
acquired via the Iran-Iraq war. Tactics are primitive, e g, ambush,
sniping, selective assassination of local officials, and only on home
ground of Kurdistan, which is devoid of high-tech infrastructure.
Recently this trend has changed with the suspicion that PKK
sabotaged a Lufthansa Airlines Boeing 737 cargo flight in the spring
of 1988. PKK may also have been behind some advanced explosives
used in several cities in central Turkey in the summer of 1988.

PKK is more terrorist than guerrilla outside the Kurdistan area and
has numerous cells operating throughout western Europe. Its most
recent high-profile event was the kidnap of Mehmet Reyhan, son of a
wealthy newspaperman, in Zurich on 27 December. Swiss police freed
Reyhan a week later, preventing a $5 million ransom payment.
Nonetheless, assassination of political opponents or those refusing to
pay extortion appears an active pursuit, as do gun running and drug
smuggling operations.

Turkey has had a difficult time dealing with the Kurds, who are
concentrated in an inaccessible, high-tension region governed for
years under a state of emergency. Using a carrot-and-stick approach
with the local population, authorities have set up a militia with
generous salary, weapons and rewards. Rewards are $250 for
arresting and $1000 for killing a Kurdish guerrilla. High fees are paid
to scouts. On the other hand, certain groups are outlawed, e g, PKK
TPLP-C and communist parties, and heavy penalties are in effect for
aiding the guerrillas. Repression in some areas is heavy and justice
can be wholly arbitrary.

With Iraq gassing Kurdish villages and Iran reportedly assisting the
PKK, Partisan and TPLP-C movements, the situation is grave. TPLP-C
has an "Urgent Action Group" which bombed the South Korean embassy
in Ankara and the Ministry of Justice office in Istanbul. New police
powers, communications, thermal imaging and sensory equipment are
being employed, as are new sniper rifles and increased military
training for recruits. A new 5000-man military unit has been formed
and specially trained for counter-guerrilla operations.

Controlling the situation is difficult, considering the number of
actors involved. The leader of the Partisans has accused PKK leader
Ocalan of being a CIA agent. Some observers predict an increase in
Kurdish terrorist activity in western Europe. It is believed that
Turkey will be able to contain the domestic problem in the near future
because the trend since 1986 has been toward fewer operations in the
eastern part of the country.

said it cost $71,000 for 45,000 copies and "countless hours" of
labor.to complete. It's too bad that with all the Pentagon's resources
they couldn't have done a better job. The report has no index, no list of

initials or acronyms (but it does have introductions by Vice-President
George Bush and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci). It also makes no
significant reference to the Kurds, Anti-Imperialist International
Brigades, One Tirol, Catalan terrorist groups or many others. If one
already knew the full anglicized name of GRAPO, one could find it, but
not otherwise, as is the case with AIIB and other groups. Statements
in the book do not agree with statements made by other US agencies.
While many security intelligence professionals bristle when the
question of freedom fighter versus terrorist arises, there is the
comment by President-elect Bush: "The difference between terrorists
and freedom fighters is sometimes clouded." In short, the book seems
more like a public relations effort than a serious reference work. The
public can look at pictures of wreckage and say Wow!

*** A university lecturer was released after denying charges of
writing a bomb threat note on an airline flight. All charges were
dropped against Peter M Canning when an 11-year-old boy who had
occupied the same seat on a prior American Airlines flight admitted
putting the note in the same seat Canning later occupied.

HOAXES CLOUD U.S. EXTREMISM PICTURE

Two recent incidents of faked death threats call attention to the fact
that perhaps as much as 15% of US alleged "threats" or "incidents" are
merely pranks or hoaxes perpetrated by alleged victims. In two recent
cases, perpetrators of hoaxes stood to gain both enoblement in
acquiring victimhood with attendant celebrity status, and also to
perpetuate the myth that they are an embattled and terrorized
minority. It also becomes much more difficult to criticize the
fanaticism and excesses of any interest group when there have been
acts of violence against it, as hoaxers are often well aware.

An anti-racist legal secretary in White Plains, NY, who voiced support
for a controversial Yonkers, NY, desegration plan was arrested for
having painted the death threats on her own apartment door that she
later insisted were painted by right-wing terrorists. Laurie A Recht
also reported false telephone threats to her home. She had been touted
as an example of moderation and was even awarded an honorary
degree by the College of New Rochelle. Both phenomena angered local
white citizens but the FBI suspected the threats were a hoax.
Surveillance cameras and a telephone tap showed she had painted her
own door and there were no phone threats.

A college student at Northwest Missouri State University was
suspended after admitting he fabricated stories about an assault and
allegedly racially motivated death threats. Quentin L Banks, 18,
admitted the hoax after the Missouri Highway Patrol began to
investigate. The student said he was so "distraught" over "racism"
that he devised a plan "to test university policy." In the wake of the
Banks case, other "racist" incidents reported at NMSU, including
supposed KKK activity, are being re-examined following evidence they
may have been fabricated or greatly exaggerated.

STATUS REPORT: U.S. LEFT-WING GROUPS

Note: Listing here does not imply that these groups are necessarily

"terrorist," but merely that they are "radical" or "extremist" and that
they have been the subject of law enforcement interest in the past..

Communist Party, USA, 239 W 23d St, NY, NY 10011. Noew has about
19,000 members, up from 6000 in the early 1960s when the party
was at its ebb. Membership is concentrated in large industrial areas,
including the New York City area, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia,
San Francisco and Seattle. The official party group for members under
18 is the Young Communist League, formerly the Young Workers
Liberation League and before that the W E B Dubois Clubs. The party
publishes the Peoples Daily World newspaper, Political Affairs, and
numerous pamphlets. The official party publishing house is
International Publishers. The CPUSA is primarily the propaganda arm
of the Soviet Union in the USA. Members are rarely involved in
violence and have avoided espionage since the 1950s. The party has
been heavily infiltrated by the FBI in the past and currently remains
under moderate surveillance.

Socialist Workers Party, 14 Charles St, NY, NY 10013. Small, heavily
minority in membership makeup, formerly Trotskyite, Marxist party
with local groups in about 20 states. Membership is between 2000
and 3000. SWP youth group is the Young Socialist Alliance, PO Box
471, NY, NY 10003, with about 25 local groups, including on major
college campuses. Membership is estimated at 450. The SWP publishes
The Militant, which gained notoriety in 1963 with a photo of Lee
Harvey Oswald clutching the newspaper in one hand and a rifle in the
other. The official SWP publishing house is Pathfinder Press. The YSA
publishes the monthly Young Socialist. The SWP andYSA have generally
avoided violence, although some YSA members have been arrested as
individuals in the past. The SWP recently won a large settlement
against the FBI for illegal surveillance and burglaries at SWP offices
around the country during the 1960s and 1970s.

*** African National Congress (Southern Africa). Announced it will

*** African National Congress (Southern Africa). Announced it will
close its bases in Angola as a gesture of support for the agreement
signed last month involving Cuabn and South African troops. It has
been estimated that ANC has seven bases in norhtern and western
Angola with 2000 ANC members training.
*** Brunswijk Jungle Commando (Suriname). Ronnie Brunswijk says
he will re-arm his troops after losing faith in the peace process of
the government.
*** Egypt's Revolution (Egypt). Dr. Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser
returned to face trial for attacks on US and Israeli diplomats. He and
20 co-defendants are charged with trying to sabotage the Camp David
accords. He is a nephew of the late Egyptian president  Gamal Abdel
Nasser, whose son, Khaled Nasser, is also among the accused but
remains a fuigitive in Yugoslavia.
*** Fatah Revolutionary Council (Abu Nidal)(Middle East).The New
York Times named a Palestinian figure, Samir Kadar, as a suspect in
the Pan Am 103 bombing. He has risen through the ranks of Abu Nidal's

organization, said the newspaper, and is now commander of a cell in Europe.
*** Fedayeen (Middle East). Four members of the left-wing terrorist
group are on trial for damaging offices of IranAir in London. British
police said the four attacked the airline's computers on 14 December.
*** GRAPO (Spain) is apparently in another resurgence since two
members were arrested in France early in January carrying plans for
attacks on Spanish commercial targets. The documents used code
names for as-yet-unknown GRAPO colleagues.
*** Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (Iran). Claimed credit for
downing Pan Am 103 as revenge for the US Navy downing an Iranian Airbus.
*** Iparretarrak (Spain). Basque separatist group had eight members
arrested in France.
*** Jewish Defense League (USA). Won a court decision to keep its
name out of a trail involving former members accused of fatally
bombing a business competitor. A Los Angeles judge said the trial of
Rochelle Manning and an accomplice cannot hear that Manning and her
husband, Robert, were once JDL members. Robert Manning is now a
fugitive living on the West Bank with other Rabbi Meir Kahane followers.
*** Kurds (Middle East). Turkey says terror attacks by the Kurds
dropped 26% in 1988 as a result of energetic security measures. Ten
missile launchers were captured, along with large amounts of other
arms and equipment. In 1988, 119 Kurds were killed, compared with
41 security personnel and 97 civilians.
*** Montoneros (Argentina). Intelligence sources dismiss reports that
the group is planning to resume large scale operations. An official of
the national intelligence agency did acknowledge, however, that two
men who committed a bank robbery are linked to the Montoneros.
*** Ohio Seven (USA). Trial on sedition charges finally has begun of
the group in Springfield, MA. Various legal developments have reduced
the defendants to three: Patricia Gros Levasseur, 40, her husband,
Raymond Luc Levasseur, 42, and Richard C Williams, 41.
*** One Tirol (Italy). Threatened new attacks against politicians,
journalists, judges and police in continuation of its campaign for
unification with Austria. One Tirol has caused great damage with
bombing of power pylons and railroad installations in South Tirol.
Police take the new threat very seriously.
*** Palestine National Salvation Front (Middle East). Has been
promised $2 million in aid by Libya, according to a Lebanese
newspaper. The aim is to create a rival PLO leadership to challenge
Yassir Arafat.
*** Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)(Peru). Is now reported to control
more than 20 villages in two provinces, an unusual strategy for a
terror group.
*** United National Front in Occupied Palestine (Middle East). Newly
formed coalition issued a call for a militant organization to replace
Yassir Arafat as leader of the Palestinian struggle. Coalition consists
of Islamic extremists, pro-Syrian radicals, Ahmed Jibril's PFLP-GC
and Abu Moussa's splinter faction of the Fatah Revolutionary Council.

violent terrorist leaders and escaped capture on several prior
occasions.
The Hague/10 January: Police disclosed arrest of three employees of a
Dutch security company involved in a series of bomb and arson
attacks. The government had refused to renew the security guard

were cooperating with the government. The nine-year campaign by the

peasants. Elsewhere, the group killed a provincial judge, an attorney
and three police officers in an ambush. Some reports said 12
terrorists were killed in the shootout that followed the ambush.

police compound in South Africa, killing one officer and wounding 28.
New Delhi/6 January: Sikhs rampaged after the execution of two
convicted assains of Indira Gandhi, killing Hindus and smashing buses

an hour while a suspicious car was checked out. Police later said a
sniffer dog had given a false alarm.
London/5 January: Naveed Aslam was sentenced to a year in jail for
phoning a bomb threat to British Airways so the resulting delay would
allow his girlfriend to catch her flight to Casablanca. She had overslept.
Bangkok/4 January: A Saudi diplomat was killed by three shots on a
sidewalk near his embassy. The killed escaped and there was no claim

home and seriously wounded by two bullets in the neck and head. The
attacker escaped and responsibility was claimed by "Soldiers of the Right.".
Medellin/3 January: Ten armed masked men kidnapped two US
missionaries who had worked in Colombia as long as 16 years.
Peshawar/30 December 1988: A French UN worker in Pakistan was
killed in his hotel room by a burst from a Ak-47 rifle. Local reports
blame Afghan secret police KHAD, but Swedish sources said it may
have been suicide.
Zurich/27 December: PKK kidnapped the son of a prominent Turkish
journalist. He was later freed by police.
Navarre/23 December: In one of several attacks claimed by ETA, a
grenade was fired at a Civil Guard post from nearby woods. When a
patrol entered the woods to investigate, they entered a minefield and
set off six explosions, seriously wounding one guardsman. In another
attack, a bar owner was assassinated as an informer.
Ankara/22 December: Portugese diplomat Sergio Manuel Pinto Mutinho
was killed near Incel by several attackers with knives. Turkish police
said the second secretary had been stabbed 18 times.
Adelaide/21 December: A huge bomb was found on the roof of an
Australian police station with all but one inch of its fuze burned. The

18-stick gelignite bomb was placed by unknown persons for unknown
reasons, police said.
Cairo/20 December: Police killed three members of an Egyptian
fundamentalist group during a raid on an apartment. One of the dead
was wanted for killing a police officer during an early December
shootout. The incident sparked riots among fundamentalists in Egypt
but the government said such acts would be met with force.
Nice/19 December: An explosion killed one resident and injured 12
others at a hotel used by immigrant workers on the French Riviera.
Most residents are Tunisians and a nearby note claimed responsibility
for "The Masada Group." The note was marked with a Star of David.
West Berlin/16 December: Police arrested seven people and charged
them with membership in an unspecified terrorist group after
explosives were found stacked in the basement of a house.
Singapore/4 November: Pirates attacked the SS Hai Hui near Horsburgh
lighthouse near here and kidnapped the master. Report of the incident

identity of his abductors.

7 disqualified from contesting top posts / Umno

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

Umno cracks down on abuses 

SEVEN candidates, six of them vying for Umno Supreme Council posts, were
disqualified from contesting the elections starting tomorrow for abuse of
power and flouting party rules.

And more are likely to be disqualified, with investigations currently under
way against some candidates for serious breaches of discipline.

At a press conference yesterday evening, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said a case
under investigation involved a contestant for the post of Umno Youth chief who
had asked delegates to swear by the Quran to support him.

Said Datuk Seri Anwar: "We have not got concrete evidence as yet but using the
Quran for this purpose to me is a serious offence."

He identified the six who were disqualified from contesting the Supreme
Council election as Datuk Aini Taib, Selangor state executive councillor;
Datuk Shariff Omar, deputy chief minister of Penang; Datuk Malik Hanapiah,
Perak state executive councillor and former political secretary of Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad; Datuk Salomon Selamat, Member of
Parliament and former political secretary of Datuk Anwar; Mr Latiff Mirasa,
Penang state executive councillor and Datuk Adam Hamid, Johor state executive
councillor.

All were among 61 people contesting for the 25 posts available on the Supreme
Council, the highest decision-making body in the party.

The seventh person disqualified from the elections was Mr Ayob Mat Aris, who
was vying for a position on the Umno Youth executive council.

Datuk Anwar said that the decision to disqualify these members were taken at a
special committee meeting chaired yesterday afternoon by Dr Mahathir. He said
that solid evidence had been obtained by the party, enabling it to take this
action.

The evidence related to money politics, abuse of power and violation of the
no-campaigning rule which was introduced by the party leadership to curb
excessive politicking.

He said that this action should put to rest fears that some people were
receiving favours, noting that Datuk Malik was the former political secretary
of the party chief while Datuk Salomon was his former political secretary.

The disqualification of the seven follows the disciplinary action taken by
Umno against five members of the Jempol division in Negeri Sembilan for being
involved in money politics.

Datuk Seri Anwar said that investigations into money politics and other
illegal practices would continue even after the elections.

Umno has been waging an ongoing battle against money politics which has been
rampant in the party in recent years.

On Sunday, party chief Dr Mahathir noted that money politics seemed to have
become a norm in Umno and the time had come to rid the party of all forms of
corruption and filth.

He said that if the party leadership did not take stern measures to remedy the
situation, it could endanger not only the party but the whole race and nation.

"We have repeatedly talked about money politics and convened a special
assembly in 1994 but the problem still could not be overcome. Instead, it
seems like it has become an institution."

SEVEN NAMED

* Datuk Aini Taib, Selangor state executive councillor * Datuk Shariff Omar,
deputy chief minister of Penang * Datuk Malik Hanapiah, Perak state executive
councillor and former political secretary of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad * Datuk Salomon Selamat, Member of Parliament and former
political secretary of Datuk Anwar * Mr Latiff Mirasa, Penang state executive
councillor * Datuk Adam Hamid, Johor state executive councillor. * Mr Ayob Mat
Aris

Sipadan, Ligitan row to go to World Court: Leaders to explore further
bridge proposal

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

MALAYSIA and Indonesia have decided to refer their claims on the Sipadan and
Ligitan Islands to the International Court of Justice.

This ends a stalemate over the islands, lying off the border between Sabah and
East Kalimantan. The two countries have been trying to resolve the issue since
1991.

The decision was made after a meeting between Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and President Suharto of Indonesian here yesterday.

During the 90-minute meeting, a wide range of issues, from economic
cooperation to the agenda for the World Trade Organisation meeting in
Singapore, were discussed.

Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesian Foreign minister, briefed the press on the
discussion. He said that after exhausting legal and technical arguments on the
islands issue, it was decided that the talks should be elevated to the
political stage.

Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and Indonesia's
State Secretary Moerdiono held four rounds of talks and both concluded that
they had strong cases. In view of this deadlock, Mr Alatas said both Dr
Mahathir and President Suharto concluded that the question of Sipadan and
Ligitan islands should be referred to the ICJ.

He told a packed press conference: "We are doing so because both sides are of
the view that the matter should not drag on too long" -as the issue might be
exploited by those not wishing Malaysia and Indonesia to have close relations.

The decision of the ICJ, he said, would be accepted by both countries. The
next step would involve Mr Alatas and his Malaysian counterpart Datuk Abdullah
Badawi working out the procedures to forward the case together.

He stressed that both countries would forward the case together. "We must move
in unison. We believe in doing so, we would resolve the issue amicably and in
a just way."

The Indonesian minister said that this case showed that whenever there was a
dispute between Asean countries, it could be settled peacefully and in the
spirit of Asean.

Indonesia's agreement to agree to refer the claim is a change from its
previous position. Last month, Armed Forces chief Feisal Tanjung was quoted by
Antara national news agency as saying that any move to refer the issue to the
international court would mean involving a third party.

He said that it was not good to let other countries which do not understand
the problem meddle in it. But Indonesia never shut the door on this method of
resolution.

Activists land on Diaoyu islands: Page 14

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lee San Chouy, Taiwan Correspondent

Protesters plant Taiwan and Chinese flags

TAIPEI -Taiwan and Hongkong protesters yesterday broke through a Japanese
maritime cordon to land on the disputed Daioyu islands, where they planted
Taiwanese and Chinese flags to challenge Tokyo's claim to the islands.

Taipei provincial assemblyman Ching Jie-shou and Hongkong legislator Tsang Kin
Shing were among the seven protesters who swam ashore to plant three
blue-and-red Taiwanese flags and one red five-star Chinese flag early
yesterday morning, said a United Evening News report filed from one of the 50
boats, which set off on the third and largest protest voyage on Sunday.

The flags were swiftly removed by Japanese Maritime Safety Agency officials.

Having accomplished its mission, the flotilla returned to the northern
Taiwanese port of Shen Ao, where a heroes' welcome greeted the protesters.

In Hongkong, the people were equally jubilant on hearing news of the
successful landing.

In Tokyo, Japanese officials gave a veiled warning that future protest boats
could be seized if found in Japanese waters.

Mr Ching said in an interview with state radio: "We will continue our efforts
to protect the Diaoyu islands ... We will not quit until we succeed."

According to the United Evening News report, at least 50 Japanese boats and
helicopters were mobilised to stop the protest boats from entering the
12-nautical-mile territorial zone claimed by Japan.

No one was hurt yesterday, although some people had to scramble onto other
protest vessels after their boat was rammed by a Japanese patrol boat amid the
tense stand-off.

Unconfirmed reports said that at least one protester fell overboard and was
then rescued.

The more than 300 activists had set sail in 30 boats from Taiwan's Wanli and
Shen Ao ports on Sunday evening for the Diaoyu islands. Twenty boats carrying
journalists accompanied them.

At 5.35 am yesterday, they arrived within the 12-nautical-mile limit where
Japanese patrol boats began to surround the flotilla.

But the Japanese boats were unable to stop the small boats whose crews had
been practising landings for a week.

Mr Ching was later quoted as saying that some activists had set off on rubber
boats and water scooters to divert the attention of the Japanese boats while
the seven swam ashore.

At 6.20 am, three activists including Mr Ching and Mr Tsang planted a Chinese
flag and a Taiwanese flag near the lighthouse erected by a Japanese right-wing
group in July.

Ten minutes later, they were driven off the island by Japanese maritime
police, who tore the flags down.

Another group of four activists, however, managed to make a landing at 6.35
am. The four, who stayed for a few minutes on the island, planted two
Taiwanese flags.

One of them, Mr Lee Chueh-min, was later quoted as saying: "We were
surrounded. The sea was covered with Japanese ships and the sky was full of
helicopters, but I had only one goal in mind -to land and to place the
Taiwanese flag.

"This is probably the most important moment of my life."

Taipei yesterday praised the landing, but reiterated its position that the
Diaoyu dispute should be resolved only through diplomacy and negotiations.

Government spokesman Su Chi said: "We always admire and recognise acts of
patriotism to protect our land. We also feel very good that ... they are
returning after a rational, peaceful protest."

However, he added: "The sovereignty and territorial disputes should all be
resolved through negotiations."

Taiwan and Japan have conducted two rounds of "unofficial" talks over the
dispute, including the issue of fishing rights near the island group, but
failed to reach an agreement.

The Diaoyu chain, known in Japan as the Senkaku islands, lie about 150 km off
north-eastern Taiwan and are believed to be potentially rich in oil and
natural gas.

Anti-Japanese sentiment in China, Taiwan and Hongkong has been rising since
July.

Two protest voyages took place last month.

The leader of the second trip, Hongkong activist David Chan, drowned after
jumping into the sea near the islands.

Taipei forum to look into cross-strait relations

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Sunny Goh

It will chart path based on public consensus

TAIWAN will hold an inaugural national conference in late December to chart
its position on troubled ties with China "based on public consensus", a
spokesman for the President's Office told The Straits Times yesterday.

The grand forum, which will take in views ranging from opposition parties to
business guilds, will also "brainstorm" changes to the island's Constitution
and the speeding up of its economic development.

Findings and suggestions from the meeting will be compiled into a report to be
submitted to President Lee Teng-hui to help him "set the direction for the
island's future", the spokesman said.

"It is the first ever meeting of its kind, and participation is expected to be
massive in terms of representation and vigorous in debate," he said by
telephone.

The "National Development Conference" will bring together 150 representatives
-50 each for discussions on the constitutional system, economic development
and cross-strait relations -who will be invited from all sectors of society.
These three have been the most problematic issues affecting Taiwan in recent
years, with corruption and triad activities on the rise and Sino-Taiwan ties
at a low ebb.

President Lee appointed Vice-President Lien Chan as the convenor of a
preparatory committee last month to work out the conference details, and
invited each of the three major political parties to assign a deputy convenor.

Mr Tsiang Yien-si, Kuomintang Central Standing Committee member and senior
adviser to the President, is expected to be the KMT's deputy convenor. The
deputy convenors for the Democratic Progressive Party and the New Party have
not yet been made known.

Asked whether the Taipei authorities would abide by the conference
recommendations, the spokesman said that the government would have to take the
suggestions very seriously, otherwise it would defeat the purpose of such a
meeting.

President Lee himself is expected to evaluate the more sensitive proposals as
part of his election pledge in the presidential election in March this year to
seek public consensus on major policy and reform programmes.

But the two opposition parties had already poured cold water on the idea,
although neither had turned down an invitation to take part. "This is just
smoke. It is like giving a candy to cheat a child," said DPP legislative whip
Yen Chin-fu.

Opposition New Party lawmaker Yok Yu-ming, also pessimistic, said the meeting
would not solve any problems.

While the conference is set for end-December, the actual dates and venue have
not been fixed. But the official Free China Journal said the meeting would
last five days, probably from Dec 23, with the Taipei International Convention
Centre and the Chungshan Building on Yangming Mountain as the two most likely
venues.

2 Taiwan officials nabbed for crime

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

TWO Taiwan councillors were detained by police in the continuing crackdown
against organised crime, the China Times reported yesterday.

Chiayi city councillor Wu Jung-an and Changhua county councillor Hsieh
Hung-lung, whose cases are not linked, are being remanded in the eastern
Taiwan prison on Green Island.

Wu, first arrested for alleged drug trafficking in August, was caught
attacking a debtor on Sept 24 together with more than 10 gangsters who were
carrying illegal arms, the Chinese-language daily said.

During investigations, unidentified witnesses told police of Wu's involvement
in several blackmail cases. Two people accused him of threatening them with a
gun and coercing them to buy second-hand cars from him at exorbitant prices.

A third person said Wu had forced him to hand over NT$200,000 (S$10,360) to
buy drugs.

As for Hsieh, he was arrested last Friday for firing a shot at a man earlier
this year.

According to China Times, he admitted shooting the man, who helped him run a
lounge, because of a financial dispute.

Communist Party to endorse Jiang"s authority at plenum

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is expected to endorse President Jiang
Zemin's "leadership and authority" at the party's plenum this week, it was
reported yesterday.

Quoting a well-informed source in Beijing, the independent Chinese-language
Ming Pao Daily News said the CCP would give its endorsement at the end of the
annual meeting.

Elaborating on his achievements, the report said that since Mr Jiang, 70,
became party general secretary in 1989, he had been placing equal emphasis on
"material civilisation" and "spiritual civilisation".

Spiritual civilisation -the promotion of communal morality in a society which
has attained economic progress -has been promoted strongly in China's official
media in recent months.

Mr Jiang has also stressed the need to "talk politics" and to place emphasis
on the "righteous spirit" and on learning.

A resolution on spiritual civilisation to be passed at the plenum would make
these theories the official line and the overall will of the party, added the
report.

In his speech to the plenum, which starts today, Mr Jiang is expected to call
for "the enhancement of the power of the party" in leading China into the 21st
century.

His vision for the party's Politburo and Central Committee is for them to "use
political superiority to control the overall situation and central authority
to coordinate the national pace and unify the party's will".

The Ming Pao report also quoted analysts as saying that Mr Jiang's call to
safeguard the party's political authority had been well received within its
ranks and in the military.

They said that the Beijing leader's determination to make political authority
the overall guiding principle showed China would continue to use "a gradually
progressive and moderate approach" towards an in-depth development of the
country's reforms.

Beijing : It"s Chinese territory: Activists land on Diaoyu islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Mary Kwang, China Correspondent

BEIJING -A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday reiterated that the
Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea were an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.

He also said that the Chinese stance on the issue was consistent and clear.

He made these remarks in response to queries from the media on China's
reaction to the early-morning landing yesterday by Hongkong and Taiwanese
protesters on the disputed islands.

The spokesman also said that incidents initiated by the Japanese side had
provoked and angered the Chinese people.

While he did not say what these incidents were, his remarks were apparently
targeted at the construction of a lighthouse on one of the islands in July by
Japanese right-wingers.

The Japanese Coastguard had even allowed the right-wingers to return to the
islands to repair the structure after it was damaged in a typhoon, but they
had turned away boats from Hongkong and Taiwan approaching the islands.

Hongkongers jubilant at news of protest landing: Activists land on Diaoyu
islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Wang Hui Ling, Hongkong Correspondent

Event grabs morning and evening headlines

HONGKONGERS greeted with jubilation the landing on the disputed Diaoyu islands
by protesters from Hongkong and Taiwan early yesterday.

News of the successful mission hit the headlines in the morning and was played
up in graphic detail by evening newspapers here.

At least one Cantonese news station devoted a few hours to the news, airing
interviews with analysts and reporters covering the event.

Some radio listeners who called a phone-in programme also referred to the
event, even though the programme dealt with a completely different topic.

A television station devoted 27 minutes of its half-hour evening news bulletin
in Cantonese to coverage of the voyage, with extensive footage of the landing,
the planting of the Chinese flag, the encounters with the Japanese authorities
as well as the return of the protesters to Taiwan's Shen Ao port.

Politicians from two of Hongkong's biggest political parties -the Democratic
Party and the Liberal Party -also welcomed the news, although they were quick
to add that now that the protesters had fulfilled their mission to plant flags
on the disputed islands, the ball was now in Beijing's court to pursue the
matter.

Democratic Party vice-chairman Yeung Sam said: "All we are trying to do is
make a symbolic protest against Japanese occupation of the islands.

"Actually, there is not much the people in the community can do because it is
all related to the foreign policy of the Chinese government.

"If the Chinese government refuses to take tough action against the Japanese
government, it will be very difficult for China to reclaim its sovereignty
over the islands."

Liberal Party vice-chairman Ronald Arculli said that he hoped the move would
give the Chinese government an understanding of the strength of feelings over
the issue and inspire it to open diplomatic channels to settle the dispute.

The New Evening Post and the Sing Tao Evening News splashed the landing on
their front pages.

Calling it a successful breach of Japanese defences, they also accused the
Japanese of crashing into some protesters' boats. One headline screamed:
"Shameless Japanese security forces remove Chinese flags but claim they were
blown away" in an apparent reference to eyewitnesses' claims that Japanese
coast guards had removed the Chinese flags placed by the protesters.

Analysts interviewed on radio said that the successful voyage was a testimony
to the better preparations and strategies adopted by the latest group of
protesters.

Democratic Party legislator Tsang Kin Shing, who was one of those who reached
one of the disputed islands, told reporters that he would not be organising
another trip to the islands to dismantle a lighthouse erected by Japanese
right-wingers. He was reported to have said that such a task should be left to
the Chinese government.

Amid the jubilation, an English-language radio station yesterday ran an
interview with a Caucasian photographer who had accompanied an earlier
ill-fated voyage to the Diaoyu islands, in which protester David Chan drowned.

He said that the attempt to make Chan out as a hero and martyr was
regrettable, as his action was foolish and had endangered lives. It was also
partly the result of frenzy whipped up by the media, he added.

Landing by HK, Taiwan activists regrettable : Japan: Activists land on
Diaoyu islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kwan Weng Kin, Japan Correspondent

Trespassing vessels could be seized, it warns

TOKYO -Japanese officials yesterday expressed regret at the early-morning
landing by Hongkong and Taiwan activists on the disputed Diaoyu islands and
hinted that vessels carrying protesters could be seized in future if they were
found trespassing in Japan's territorial seas.

Commenting on the landing, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto stressed the need
for the authorities on all sides to take a level-headed approach.

"Whether this affair will blow up any further will depend on whether the
authorities on both sides will be able to create calm," he told reporters.

Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Teijiro Furukawa, standing in as the
government's chief spokesman, described as "extremely regrettable" the landing
on the Diaoyu group -known as Senkaku islands to the Japanese -and echoed the
Premier's call for calm.

"Relations with neighbouring countries and territories must not deteriorate
because of such incidents. We hope all parties concerned will deal with it
calmly," he said.

Although vessels carrying activists from Hongkong and Taiwan succeeded in
eluding patrol boats belonging to the Maritime Safety Agency -Japan's coast
guard -and got close to the islands yesterday, the agency made no attempt to
seize the trespassers.

"But in future, if they do not comply with our warning to withdraw, we will
take appropriate measures," said Mr Furukawa, raising the possibility that the
agency would in future apprehend the protest boats.

In October 1990, the Japanese authorities succeeded in repelling a fishing
boat carrying Taiwanese athletes that attempted to plant an Olympic torch on
the Diaoyu islands.

Yesterday afternoon, Foreign Ministry Vice-Minister Sadayuki Hayashi announced
that Japan would ask the authorities in Beijing, Hongkong and Taipei formally
to prevent a repeat of yesterday's incident.

"The problem must not affect our relations with neighbouring countries. I
believe China and Taiwan feel the same way," he said.

Japanese officials also expressed the hope that the matter would subside now
that the activists had achieved their objective of reaching the islands and
demonstrating the respective claims of the Chinese and Taiwanese.

On Sept 26, Hongkong protest leader David Chan drowned in a mishap off the
disputed islands after a vessel carrying him and other activists were
prevented from landing by Japanese patrol boats.

Yesterday's landing was displayed prominently on the front pages of the
evening editions of the major Japanese papers although the media here has by
and large given minimal coverage to the territorial dispute with China and
Taiwan.

For example, there have been no stories in the press to explain the historical
basis for Japan's claim to the islands, reflecting in part the fact that most
Japanese have shown little interest in the dispute.

But despite the relatively low-key treatment accorded the issue here, Mr
Hashimoto expressed unhappiness with the Japanese media recently, saying it
was against Japan's national interests for the press to highlight the issue.

Proposed sales-tax hike Japan"s main issue for coming polls

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kwan Weng Kin, Japan Correspondent

TOKYO -The government's proposed hike in the sales tax from next April emerged
clearly yesterday as the main issue dividing Japan's two largest political
parties in the upcoming general election, campaigning for which begins
officially today.

The tax-policy gap between the Liberal Democratic Party led by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and the opposition New Frontier Party headed by Mr Ichiro
Ozawa was highlighted in a nationally-televised debate for leaders of Japan's
six largest parties.

Seeking to continue as Premier after the polls, Mr Hashimoto reiterated his
determination to raise the sales tax from the existing three per cent to five
per cent next year to pay for the burgeoning costs of welfare and other public
services.

But he stressed that the hike would be linked to the implementation of
administrative and economic reforms and that pensioners and other low-income
earners likely to be penalised by the higher tax would receive special
consideration.

Criticising Mr Hashimoto's coalition government for failing to push hard
enough for reforms so far, Mr Ozawa opposed an increase in the sales tax and
pledged to reduce taxes by 18 trillion yen (S$228 billion) and to make up for
the loss in revenue by slashing government expenditure and expanding consumer
spending.

The Japan Communist Party was the only other party among the six yesterday
which included the Democratic Party of Japan, the Social Democratic Party and
the Sakigake -that supported a freeze in the sales tax. Apart from this
glaring difference over tax policy between the LDP and NFP, all six parties
were unanimous in their calls for comprehensive reforms to the country's
administrative and economic systems.

LDP's Mr Hashimoto appealed to voters to give his party a mandate to bring
about a "robust economy" through deregulation and reforms and reminded
everyone that he had plans to set up a panel of advisers to work out an action
programme within a year.

Mr Ozawa, saying he would retire from politics if his party should come to
power and fail to carry out its election promises, warned voters they had a
choice between "prosperity through drastic reforms" or "decay by taking no
action".

Yesterday's party leaders' debate laid down the battle lines for the election
campaigning which kicks off today.

But politicians will undoubtedly have difficulty getting their messages across
to their electorate as a survey by the quasi-national NHK network released
yesterday found that only 50 per cent of Japanese voters were interested in
the upcoming polls.

This was 17 percentage points lower than in the July 1993 elections, which
ushered in Japan's first coalition government in decades.

Nevertheless, a record number of over 1,400 candidates are expected to vie for
500 Lower House seats in the Oct 20 election which will be conducted under a
new system of single-seat wards and proportional representation.

Many candidates belonging to the major parties are exploiting a provision in
the election law that allows candidates to stand in both single-seat wards and
proportional representation constituencies, thus increasing their chances of
winning a parliamentary seat.

Indonesia urged to ban distribution and sale of alcohol

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Paul Jacob, Indonesia Correspondent

Religious objections, dangers of drink cited

JAKARTA -Muslim grassroots leaders and youth representatives have called on
the local government here and provincial administrations elsewhere to move
towards imposing a comprehensive ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol
in the country.

About 3,000 representatives, citing religious objections and the dangers that
alcohol and its easy availability posed to Indonesian youths in particular,
made the call in a statement issued after gathering for a sermon on Sunday at
the Matraman Mosque in East Jakarta.

The representatives recognised efforts to tighten the supervision, control and
sale of alcohol through local government regulations but said that the
authorities should go a step further and impose an outright ban.

Their statement said that distributors and consumers were already faced with
the full weight "of sanctions from Allah".

As such, government moves to impose stringent controls and greater supervision
on alcohol -such as by increasing the cost of distribution licence fees and
higher penalties for violating rules -had to be revised.

The authorities should instead "prevent and prohibit every effort to legalise
alcoholic beverages" and should develop policies and action programmes which
would "increase faith and piety" and ensure there could be abstinence from
"that which is known to be forbidden".

The Republika daily yesterday quoted leaders like Haji Nurudin, secretary of
the Madura Ulemas Board, as saying yesterday that "alcohol, or wine and
liquor, according to the Prophet Muhammed, is the source of all evil".

The call on Sunday followed moves by local governments in Jakarta, West
Sumatra and East Java to institute new rules which they believed would help
keep alcohol distribution and consumption under control while not eliminating
it altogether.

Higher annual licence fees -up to 10 million rupiah (S$6,000) from the current
one million rupiah -have been proposed for approval by the Home Affairs
Ministry. These would ultimately increase the cost of alcohol sold at outlets
and thereby prevent youths from being able to afford to drink.

Labels must also be affixed on bottles warning that liquor is harmful and the
minimum content of bottles must be 200 cc -again to ensure that the higher
cost would make alcoholic beverages unaffordable to youths.

The grassroots leaders and youth representatives who met on Sunday were not
alone in their quest to ban the sale and distribution of alcohol.

Representatives of the Muslim-based United Development Party have said
previously that steps being proposed by the local government meant that liquor
could still be sold.

The West Sumatra chapter of the Majelis Ulama Indonesia, the country's highest
council on Islamic affairs, made a similar call for controlling regulations to
be revised so that alcohol would be banned, while Muslim leaders in East Java
also urged a review, citing alcohol's incompatibility with religious
teachings.

There has yet to be any formal central-government reaction although leaders
such as Information Minister Harmoko, who also chairs the ruling Golkar party,
said previously that the party wanted firmer measures in place, including the
imposition of strict maximum limits on the alcohol content of beverages sold
to the public.

Another underlying argument used by opponents of alcohol has been the link
which many see between alcohol consumption and criminal activity, and
alcohol's effects on youths.

Beer brewers here produce a total of 150 million litres annually with total
sales amounting to 500 billion rupiah.

According to the Republika daily, annual domestic production of alcoholic
beverages totals eight million cartons while imports amount to five million
cartons annually.

Two main blocs emerging as Thai parties get set for polls

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Sinfah Tunsarawuth in Bangkok

THAI political parties have virtually re-aligned themselves into two blocs in
the run-up to next month's general election with the Democrat and New
Aspiration parties forming the core of each camp.

The Democrats received a boost over the weekend when prominent banker and
former finance minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda -believed to be groomed by
party leader Chuan Leekpai to succeed him -announced he would contest the
polls on a Democrat ticket.

Mr Tarrin's decision to make his electoral debut in Bangkok is likely to
enhance the prospects of the Democrats winning most of the 37 seats in the
capital.

The Democrats last week forged an understanding with four parties -Chart
Pattana, Palang Dharma, Seritham and Solidarity -to form the next coalition
government if the party won the most seats in the House of Representatives on
Nov 17.

The five parties also agreed to be "friendly" and to avoid attacking each
other during the election campaign.

But their agreement did not preclude any party from joining the other bloc
-led by the New Aspiration Party (NAP) of General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh -if it
should win the election and form the core of the next government.

The NAP has not yet received any open support from other parties, but it is
likely that three parties -Social Action, Prachakorn Thai and Muanchon -will
align themselves with the former army chief. The four parties are currently
partners in the caretaker government of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa,
whose Chart Thai party was weakened last week when a group led by its
secretary-general, Sanoh Thienthong, defected to the NAP.

Mr Banharn had said he did not expect to become Prime Minister after next
month's polls, but would remain as the leader of Chart Thai.

He has not yet indicated which of the two parties -Democrats and the NAP -his
party will support.

Gen Chavalit was the prime mover in forcing Mr Banharn to announce his
resignation last month in the face of a no-confidence motion in parliament.

Mr Banharn did not honour his pledge and leave office, but instead dissolved
the House and called for fresh elections on Nov 17.

With Mr Tarrin's decision to contest the election, the Democrats will be able
to present a strong economic team which should appeal to the educated
middle-class, an important electoral group in the capital.

Mr Tarrin told a radio interview yesterday that apart from him, former deputy
premier and banker Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, former minister in charge of
energy affairs Dr Savit Bhotiwihok and Democrat party spokesman Abhisit
Vejjajiva would be in the economic team if the Democrats won the right to form
the next government.

A former top banker before entering politics, Mr Tarrin earned high marks as
finance minister in the Chuan government when he took up the Cabinet post as a
non-MP at the invitation of Mr Chuan.

Jakarta detains 24 Taiwanese and Thai fishing boats

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Paul Jacob, Indonesia Correspondent

JAKARTA -Increased patrols by naval ships and military maritime aircraft have
resulted in the detention of 24 Thai and Taiwanese fishing boats which entered
territorial waters in the eastern part of Indonesia last week, the Media
Indonesia newspaper reported yesterday.

The latest intrusions come in the wake of the seizure of 50 fishing boats from
China in the latter half of last month after they entered Indonesian waters
illegally and were found to have had false documents permitting them to fish
in the area.

Indonesian navy chief Vice-Admiral Arief Kushariadi disclosed the latest
round-up of 24 vessels, but without giving a breakdown. He is due to visit the
naval base in Tual, Maluku, where the vessels and 300 Thai and Taiwanese
fishermen are detained.

He said the increased number of fishing boats detained in recent months was
the result of heightened round-the-clock monitoring of east Indonesian waters
by naval patrols and air-force maritime aircraft.

The Indonesian military disclosed last month that ships from its
Surabaya-based Eastern Fleet and other bases would intensify patrols in the
country's resource-rich eastern waters -as well as in the waters around the
Natuna islands where a multi-million-dollar natural gas project was getting
under way.

Vice-Admiral Arief said the Chinese, Taiwanese and Thai vessels detained had
entered Indonesian waters illegally and were fishing in the area using fake
permits.

Permits must be obtained from local authorities and the fact that false
documents had been issued indicated possible collusion between local
businessmen and local authorities, he said.

The question of prosecutions of those detained so far would be left to the
regional office of the Attorney-General, he added. It was no longer a matter
for the navy as the case now also involved the question of how the vessels had
been able to secure fishing permits.

Late last month, the navy reported detaining seven Chinese boats which were
flying the Indonesian flag in waters off the coast of southeastern Maluku -the
first time such a ploy had been detected.

NSTB executive director and surgeon wife die as car hits tree: "Champion of
R&D, and a good friend", "Surgeon well-loved byfriends and patients" and
"Retired teacher pleasant and respected"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Dorothy Ho

Car crash in Perth 

NATIONAL Science and Technology Board executive director Vijay Mehta and his
wife, Dr Amar Kaur, were among three people who died in a car crash near Perth
on Saturday.

They were in a car which was being driven by retired teacher Jaganathan
Govindsamy, 62, when it went out of control and hit a tree, Perth police
confirmed yesterday.

Mr Mehta, 45, his wife, 41, and Mr Jaganathan's wife, Suppamal, a 60-year-old
retired teacher, died on the spot.

Mr Jaganathan was admitted to hospital, and was discharged yesterday.

The Mehtas, who had no children, were in Australia because Dr Amar, the head
of Toa Payoh Hospital's ear, nose and throat department, had been attending a
medical conference in Cairns, Queensland, from Sept 28 to Oct 3.

After the conference, they went to Perth to visit the Jaganathans, who were
old family friends, and stayed with them in their home there.

The Jaganathans' daughter, Rebekah, 27, a church worker, said in a telephone
interview yesterday that her parents had taken the Mehtas out sightseeing on
Saturday when the tragedy occurred.

"They were on their way back from Margaret River when the accident happened,"
she said.

The accident occurred near Busselton, about 250 km south of Perth, according
to the Major Crash Investigation Section of the Perth police, which is
handling the case.

The Jaganathans' white Mazda 626 sedan had split into two on impact, another
family member said yesterday. The couple also have a 28-year-old son, who is
in university.

News of the three deaths shocked colleagues and friends here. NSTB chairman
Teo Ming Kian was among those who paid tribute to Mr Mehta's abilities as an
engineer at the forefront of Singapore's Research and Development efforts.

"Vijay and his wife, Amar, were personal friends. Apart from the loss to the
board, their unfortunate deaths were also a tragic and personal loss to me and
my family," Mr Teo said in a statement.

He said that he had brought Mr Mehta from the Ministry of Defence to the NSTB
in 1993 at a time when it had been experiencing frequent changes in
leadership.

"He brought stability to NSTB. He was looking forward to leading the board
into the second phase of development," Mr Teo added.

Mr Mehta graduated with first class honours in aeronautical engineering from
the University of Manchester and obtained a master's degree from Stanford
University in California.

His wife, the only woman ENT surgeon in Singapore, studied medicine here and
did her postgraduate work in Edinburgh, Scotland, and at Stanford University.

She was active in the Sikh community and was in the midst of planning a clinic
at the Central Sikh Temple.

Several doctors and staff members at Toa Payoh Hospital were in tears
yesterday when they learnt that she had died and some of were too distraught
to speak.

Meanwhile in Perth, police were waiting to interview Mr Jaganathan, who was
resting at home. He had some stitches near one ear, and suffered bruises and a
sore shoulder.

"He does not remember anything," said his daughter, Rebekah.

Car levy on S"poreans : "Reasons not good enough"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

JOHOR BARU -The Malaysian Chinese Association has urged the Johor Baru City
Council to give more valid reasons to collect a M$3 (S$1.70) levy from
Singapore cars entering the country through the Johor causeway.

The Star quoted Johor Baru MCA division secretary Wee Ka Sion as saying: "The
levy should not be imposed as a retaliatory measure against the Singapore
Government for charging Malaysian cars M$30 if they enter the republic more
than five days in a year.

"There has to be a valid reason ... such as to reduce traffic congestion."

He added the MCA division would support the council's intention to study the
imposition of the levy.

"The funds arising from the levy must also be for a good cause such as road
upgrading instead of merely filling up the council's coffers," he said.

Leaders to explore further bridge proposal: Sipadan, Ligitan row to go to
World Court

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

The Mahathir-Suharto meeting

INDONESIA and Malaysia have agreed to explore further the idea of a bridge
linking Peninsular Malaysia and North Sumatra.

Both countries, however, have made it clear that the private sector ought to
come up with capital for the project, which would enhance travel and
communications between Malaysians and Indonesians.

This proposal was among a range of economic and trade issues discussed by
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and President Suharto at a
90-minute meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.

The Indonesian leader was on a two-day visit. He was accompanied by Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas and State Secretary Moerdiono.

At a press conference, Mr Alatas said Indonesia thought the idea of a bridge
from Peninsular Malaysia to North Sumatra was a good one.

It was consistent with planned bridges linking Sumatra with Java and other
parts of Indonesia, he said.

The bridge would also go well with Jakarta's policy of allowing tourists from
neighbouring countries to drive and use their cars in the country.

Mr Alatas said President Suharto and Dr Mahathir also discussed.

* Trade between the two countries. Dr Mahathir noted that while investments in
Indonesia had increased, there was still room for expansion.

Indonesia said that it welcomed investments and hoped that investors showed
interest in the eastern part of the the country and in labour intensive
industries.

* The increasing traffic in the Straits of Malacca. Mr Alatas said that to
alleviate the situation in the straits, Indonesia offered an alternative route
for large ships through the Lombok Straits.

* The World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore. Both leaders agreed that
non-trade related issues such as human rights and labour matters should not be
included. Otherwise, the meeting's agenda would be overloaded.

Mr Alatas was also asked about the reported split among Asean nations on
allowing Myanmar into the grouping.

He said that there was no divergence of opinion on allowing Myanmar in. The
only difference of opinion was when the country should become a member of
Asean.

Indonesia's position was straightforward: if procedures were followed, then it
was prepared to accept Myanmar anytime.

Asked if the human rights record of Myanmar's army junta would be a factor in
determining its membership in Asean, he noted that even the United Nations did
not evaluate the internal situation in a country before allowing it to be a
member.

Action called against sect for "causing families to break up"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

JOHOR BARU -The Malaysian Chinese Association has urged the Home Affairs
Ministry to act against a religious sect for allegedly breaking up families of
its followers.

The Star yesterday quoted the party's Johor Baru division secretary, Mr Wee Ka
Siong, as saying that the group "preaches a lifestyle contrary to local family
values". He did not elaborate.

He said the group had been operating in the state for several years and its
membership was growing.

"We have received several complaints from the Chinese community against the
Taiwan-based group which has brainwashed some people.

"Initial investigations show that many teenagers and wives who joined the sect
have left their homes and cannot be traced.

"There have also been allegations of sect members being told to refrain from
sleeping with non-member spouses," he added.

The sect's leaders also compelled members to coerce their relatives to join
it.

A businessman, Mr Tan Kim Boo, 39, said his 30-year-old wife had been missing
since December last year after joining the sect in 1989. He said she had also
tried to force him to become a member.

"She left saying that she did not want anything to do with me or our
five-year-old son," he said, adding the sect had more than 100 members in Desa
Cemerlang alone.

Retired teacher pleasant and respected: "NSTB executive director and
surgeon wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

THE retired teacher who died in Saturday's accident in Perth was a pleasant
woman who was respected by her students and colleagues alike.

Mrs Suppamal Jaganathan, 60, became a teacher at her alma mater in 1956 after
she graduated from St Hilda's School in 1955.

"She's a very pleasant woman and a very nice person," said Mrs A. Abraham, 59,
an ex-colleague and friend of Mrs Jaganathan.

"It's so sad that she died."

The principal of St Hilda's Secondary School added: "We were all so shocked,
it was so sudden."

Mrs Jaganathan used to teach English and mathematics at St Hilda's Primary
School and was the school's English and library coordinator before retiring in
1989.

Her retirement came just before she emigrated to Perth with her family in
early 1990.

Mrs Abraham, who has known Mrs Jaganathan since 1969, said the retired teacher
visited Singapore regularly even after she moved to Perth.

She had moved there with her husband, Mr Jaganathan Govindsamy, 62, a retired
teacher from Upper Serangoon Technical School, and two children.

Daughter Rebekah, 27, works in a church in Perth, and her son, 28-year-old
Sri, studies aviation at the Edith Cowan University in Perth.

When contacted, Rebekah was too distraught to talk about her mother.

Mrs Jaganathan's niece, Madam Malini Krishna, 38, a teacher at Hai Sing High
School, said that her aunt was a friendly person who was hardworking and
pleasant.

"When friends heard about the accident, those who lived as far away as Sydney
called up the family to ask what had happened," said Madam Krishna.

She added that Mrs Jaganathan's family had planned to come to Singapore for a
wedding next month.

About eight members of the Jaganathan family are already in Perth, said Mrs
Abraham.

They include Mrs Jaganathan's sisters Mrs Kasturi Shanmugan, who works as a
clerk at St Hilda's Secondary School, and Mrs Amurthavalli Naidu, an
ex-principal of Telok Kurau Secondary.

Other family members, Mr and Mrs A. Nathan, also went to Perth. Mr Nathan is
the principal of Upper Serangoon Technical School.

Madam Krishna, who was supposed to leave for Perth today, has cancelled her
trip as she said the family was expected to return soon.

Surgeon well-loved by friends and patients: "NSTB executive director and
surgeon wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

NEWS of the death of Dr Amar Kaur, Singapore's only woman ear, nose and throat
surgeon, left the staff of Toa Payoh Hospital's ENT clinic -including clerks,
nurses and other doctors -shocked and red-eyed.

She was well-loved by both her colleagues and patients, for the care and
concern she showed everyone, and the hospital had given her an award for
excellent service.

Its chief executive, Mr Liak Teng Lit, said that all the staff in the ENT
clinic cried when they received news of her death yesterday morning.

A friend, ENT consultant A. B. John of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said: "I've
never seen a patient who has not had good things to say of her."

Dr Amar, 41, graduated from the then University of Singapore in 1979 and later
went to Edinburgh for a training fellowship.

In 1991, she left to spend a year at Stanford University in California for
advanced training in otolaryngology (ENT).

She spent a year at the Singapore General Hospital after that and left in 1993
to head the ENT division at Toa Payoh Hospital.

Her colleagues, including the former head of SGH's otolaryngology department,
Dr Chew Chuan Tieh, knew her as one of the best ENT surgeons here.

He remembered her as a good team player, who worked tirelessly to help build
the hospital's ENT division.

"When she started about three years ago, there was only one other doctor
besides Dr Kaur in the division. Very often she would be called in the middle
of the night to perform emergency procedures.

"I would see her working at 1 or 2 am. She would work without complaining."

She married Mr Vijay Mehta, the executive director of the National Science and
Technology Board, about three years ago and Mr Liak described them as a loving
couple.

Mr Mehta would visit her frequently at the hospital so that they could have
their lunch together.

Dr Amar was also active in social work in the Sikh community. She was a member
of the Punjabi-Sikh Welfare Council and the head of the council's medical
sub-committee. It had been formed to open an outpatient clinic in the Central
Sikh Temple, in Serangoon Road.

Council chairman Sorinder Singh said he was to have met her yesterday.

He said: "So it came as a terrible shock to me when I got the news on Sunday
night, that she had died."

He described Dr Amar as a woman who would bend over backwards to help others
in need. She had been actively involved in the community's welfare work for
more than 10 years.

The couple's deaths were particularly painful for Dr Aw Chong Yin, senior
registrar at Toa Payoh, who had worked with Dr Amar since 1993.

They had grown close and he had become a close family friend. In fact, the two
doctors attended a medical conference in Cairns in Australia the week before
the accident.

His voice breaking, he said: "I can't believe that they are gone, especially
Amar, she was always so lively and energetic."

Champion of R&D, and a good friend: "NSTB executive director and surgeon
wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

Mr Vijay Mehta described as balanced and mature, approachable and good to
staff

PEOPLE who knew Mr Vijay Mehta remembered him yesterday as an outstanding
engineer who championed research and development, and as a good friend who
always had time for people.

Friends and colleagues were shocked by the news that the executive director of
the National Science and Technology Board had died in a three-death car crash
near Perth last Saturday.

Brigadier-General Wesley D'Aranjo, deputy secretary of technology, Ministry of
Defence (Mindef), who knew Mr Mehta for about 20 years, said: "We were very
close friends.

"He was an excellent engineer and a balanced and mature person who was always
willing to listen and consider the alternatives. He was also very approachable
and good to his staff."

Mr Mehta, 45, had worked under BG D'Aranjo in Mindef's Defence Materiel
Organisation before moving to the NSTB. BG D'Aranjo said: "Very rarely did I
see him get angry. He would get angry only on points of principle.

"The defence technology and research development communities in Singapore are
shocked and saddened by his death, and would like to convey their heartfelt
regrets to Mr Mehta's family."

In a statement, the NSTB paid tribute to Mr Mehta, who was seconded from
Mindef before his appointment as its executive director in August 1993.

It said he led the board successfully in several initiatives such as the
Research Incentive Scheme for Companies and the Technology Development Fund.

Between 1991 and 1995, the board secured $2.7 billion in R&D investments from
the private sector, set up 13 national research centres and institutes and
various schemes to encourage innovation and technology commercialisation, and
expanded its R&D manpower pool. During his term, three new research institutes
and centres were set up -the Environmental Technology Institute, Institute of
Molecular Agrobiology and the Centre for Signal Processing.

The board said he had played a key role in charting Singapore's science and
technology directions. He co-chaired the National Science and Technology Plan
Steering Committee, contributing to the formulation of the five-year $4
billion National Science and Technology Plan.

Overseas, he was instrumental in forging strong science and technology links
with Canada, Germany, Israel, India and the United States, and represented
Singapore on the Asean Committee for Science and Technology and in Apec's
senior officials' meeting for science and technology.

He also served on the boards of Singapore Technologies Electronic and
Engineering Limited, Singapore Science Park and National Biotech Committee,
and was an observer on the Economic Development Board's executive committee.
He was awarded a Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 1991.

Professor Su Guaning, director of the Defence Science Organisation and a close
friend, said: "He was a person who could rally people together and get them to
work towards a common goal. He loved life and was a good friend to many."

Mr Lim Swee Say, director of NTUC's administration and research unit, who
co-chaired the National Science and Technology Plan Steering Committee with Mr
Mehta, said: "He laid a clear vision for the future growth of R&D in Singapore
towards the year 2000. He will be fondly remembered and sadly missed by all."

Restaurants now list prices of "extras": "Check it out" and "Prices listed
after customers" grouses"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Dawn Tan

On the menu: Prices of * Peanuts * Pickles * Wet towels * Chinese tea

IF YOU go out to a Chinese restaurant for dinner tonight, be prepared for some
extra items on the menu.

The prices of peanuts, pickles, wet towels and Chinese tea are now being
printed in some restaurants here.

For years these have been accepted as unlisted items for which diners had to
pay. Sometimes these little extras came to as much as $20 for a table of 10.

The change is a result of the Restaurant Association of Singapore's proposal
for its Chinese restaurant-members to list and price these items to avoid
misunderstandings.

The association has about 100 Chinese eateries as members, half the number of
such restaurants in Singapore.

It said it sent out about 120 letters to these members about two months ago
after such items became an issue among consumers earlier this year.

It did not know how many had adopted the proposal. A Straits Times check found
that 14 restaurants have already done so.

They are Tung Lok Sharksfin's eight restaurants, Sin Leong's two restaurants,
Jumbo Serangoon and Jumbo Seafood, Victoria City and Szechuan Garden.

Another nine contacted -the Lucky Restaurants group's six restaurants, Dragon
Phoenix Restaurant and Yunnan Group's two restaurants -said they will be doing
so when they reprint their menus by the end of the year.

The prices of the items vary slightly at the different restaurants. At Dragon
Phoenix, for example, peanuts, towels and Chinese tea come to $17 for a table
of 10.

The Szechuan Garden spokesman said: "This way, it's clear-cut. There won't be
any misunderstanding between the restaurant and our diners."

Jumbo Serangoon's restaurant manager Bernard Chia said: "Customers who
complain usually go to the association. If we inform diners of the prices,
there will be no communication breakdown."

Traditionally, at Chinese restaurants, diners find out how much the extras
cost only when they get the bill. But some people, including tourists, have
complained that this was unfair.

The association's assistant director, Ms Chua Say Khiang, said: "Nowadays,
customers are more vocal and they will speak up if they are not happy.

"If the restaurants state the prices clearly, then they won't have grounds to
complain."

"As time goes by, more restaurants are likely to do so. No restaurant wants to
leave a bad impression on its diners."

But five others contacted -Teochew Garden, May Garden and Tsui Hang Village's
three restaurants -said they did not see the need for the items to be listed,
as they have never had complaints before.

A May Garden spokesman said the restaurant did not face a problem as waiters
ask the diners if they want the "extras" before serving them.

But Lucky Restaurants' group chairman Edmund Loo said: "We are in the service
industry. We cannot keep asking the customer whether he wants this or that.
It's quite rude in front of his guests.

"Stating the prices clearly is the best thing to do."

Tung Lok Sharksfin's (Scotts) restaurant manager Paul Lo said: "Diners expect
to be served appetisers, wet towels and Chinese tea. It's part and parcel of
fine dining in a Chinese restaurant."

Several diners welcomed the move. Administrator Loretta Yeo, 21, said: "Diners
have the right to know the cost of the "extras" before starting their meal
since they are paying for it."

Housewife Amy Tan, 43, noted: "I'd rather patronise a restaurant that is
upfront with me than one which gives me a nasty surprise after the meal."

Prices listed after customers" grouses: "Check it out" and "Restaurants now
list prices of "extras" "

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

SPARKING A CHANGE

A COMPLAINT to The Straits Times prompted the Restaurant Association of
Singapore to start listing the prices of towels and other extras.

A reader complained in the Forum page on May 30 that she felt cheated after
being charged $8 for two plates of Szechuan pickled vegetables at a Chinese
restaurant.

The Consumers Association of Singapore, in its reply, said that restaurants
ought to ask customers if they wanted such "extra" items.

It added that "the most upfront practice was to include the prices on the
menus so that customers will not be taken by surprise and be embarrassed".

It urged the Restaurant Association of Singapore to take the matter up and
regulate practices in the business.

The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board also said then that between August last
year and May this year, three Western tourists had complained about being
charged for items not on the menu.

In July the restaurant association discussed whether to encourage members to
list the prices of the "extras" on the menu, or to ask them to consult their
guests before serving them.

It then sent about 120 letters to its member Chinese restaurants, proposing
that they list the prices of the "extras".

Grandmother"s outstanding volunteer work rubs off on her

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

FOREIGN student Sandy Chan, 14, a Malaysian, has only been living in Singapore
with her paternal grandmother, Madam Leong Ah Say, 61, a housewife, for two
years.

But already, her grandmother's volunteer work with the elderly has had an
impact on her.

About four or five times a week over the past year, she has been helping her
grandmother deliver meals to needy old folk living nearby.

Sometimes, she would even do their housework for them.

On Sunday, she watched proudly as her grandmother received one of nine
outstanding service awards given to befrienders and befriender coordinators by
the Lions Befriender Service Association.

The awards were given to volunteers who had gone beyond the call of duty to
help the lonely elderly with various needs, such as delivery of meals and
housework.

In Madam Leong's case, she received the award for being a consistent volunteer
for the past five years.

She had not only cooked and delivered meals to several elderly people living
nearby, but she had also done their housework and looked after last rites and
funeral arrangements.

Apart from the nine outstanding service awards which were given for the first
time, the association also gave 68 other volunteers fiveand 10-year
long-service awards.

The association is the single largest group of volunteers in Singapore
providing direct service to the elderly.

Started by the Ministry of Community Development in 1982, it was taken over by
the Lions Clubs of Singapore North, Serangoon Gardens and Stamford last year.

It now has 820 volunteers befriending a total of 1,653 elderly people.

Mr Shiva Banerjee, the association's chairman, said that there were plans to
expand its programme to reach out to more of the 20,000 lonely elderly living
in Singapore.

"The people we are serving now are only the tip of the iceberg," he said.

On Sunday, in front of a crowd of more than 800 volunteers, Lions Club
members, ministry officials and grassroots leaders, Mr Sidek Saniff, Senior
Minister of State for Education and guest of honour at the occasion, praised
the award recipients.

On helping others, Mr Sidek said: "I have always remembered something which my
father told me. When you help people, forget about it. Try to think of what
you have yet to contribute, of people that you have yet to help. But if people
help you, you remember it until your last breath."

If Singaporeans had this kind of value system, then they would become caring,
he said.

Retirees to pay only $18 to keep club membership

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Ahmad Osman

SUCCESSFUL PROTEST

RETIREES in the Civil Service Club will continue to pay an annual fee of only
$18 if they do not want to use its facilities with their families.

Those who opt for free supplementary membership for their spouses and up to
three unmarried children between 12 and 21 years old have to pay more from Jan
1 next year.

The amount is $6 per month or $72 annually for those who used to work in
Divisions One, Two and Three in the public sector.

It will remain at $3 every month or $36 each year for former Division Four
officers.

There is a one-time administrative charge of only $10 for each supplementary
card for a family member under the two-tier ordinary membership scheme
starting next year.

The new option was offered to all 1,846 retirees by the club general manager,
Mr Chan Foon Chee, last Saturday.

He told them last month that they would lose their membership if they did not
join the scheme offering a package "which could not be obtained anywhere".

It was meant to boost the club's membership of 9,895 and attract more members
to use facilities in three clubhouses which were under-utilised on weekdays.

Some retirees protested that the scheme would force those who could not afford
the new fees to leave the club.

They also complained that it was unfair to make them pay more when the annual
fees would be halved to $72 for Division One officers.

The Government Pensioners' Association, Singapore, wrote two letters urging
the club to allow retirees drawing small monthly pensions to continue paying
$18 per year.

They should not be deprived of "the only affordable club available to us",
association secretary Thampoo Panjacharam said.

He noted that the cut in the fees for those in the higher divisional status
showed that the club was concerned about the need to recruit such people as
members.

These officers, he argued, would be able to pay the fees even after they
retired because of their enhanced pensions.

"Many of us who retired prior to Jan 1, 1982, are not that lucky," he wrote to
Mr Chan last week.

"It is this group of pensioners who need succour in such things as social
activities and entertainment," he said.

He said later that the option was welcomed by retirees who did not go to the
club regularly and did not need the family package.

These people, he added, should be allowed to continue paying the $18 annual
fee for themselves.

Two retirees said they would become ordinary members as the fees from next
year were cheap.

"I do not mind paying $6 every month. It is very cheap," said Mr O.Y. Chan, a
retired police superintendent.

Said Mr Wong Keng Pun, a retired senior Customs superintendent: "The
facilities offered by the club are comparable to those in other clubs. My
three children are all above 21 years, but my wife will benefit from the new
scheme."

Polly wants a letter, Polly wants a letter

School's English project lets pupils' voices be heard

FOUR Primary 5 pupils, who wrote to the school newsletter as part of an
English project, ended up improving not just their language skills, but also
the life of a schoolmate.

Their suggestion, that a ramp be built to help a mother who carried her
disabled daughter up some steps to her class every day, was taken up by the
school.

Shuqun Primary also replaced the harsh ringing of the school bell with a
musical chime, acting on a suggestion from another pupil.

The pupils have been dropping these suggestions into a letter-box at the feet
of a cardboard cut-out of a parrot called Chatterbox.

Eight teachers compile the letters, jokes, riddles, essays and poems for a
newsletter called Chat-a-Away, which is distributed throughout the school
every term.

The newsletter is part of the school's English project called Joy-Write. It
was introduced in 1992 to help the school's 1,900 pupils improve their writing
skills.

Principal Wong Chwee Neo said the main aim of the project was to publish
children's work. The idea of having an audience, she said, was an incentive
for the children to write.

Madam Wong presented the English project at the 11th Sharing of Experiences
for primary school principals on Saturday. The session was organised by the
Primary School Professional Committee.

In an interview yesterday, Madam Wong said: "The children can express their
feelings this way and we have come to know them better.

"Chat-a-Way is now seen as being part of the school identity."

The school receives an average of 120 letters a term, or about five per class.

In them, children ask for advice on school matters such as managing their
studies and also on personal issues such as coping with parents who seem to
favour one child over another.

One child wrote to say that the school should look for a mate for the lonely
rabbit in the school's eco-garden, while another asked for help as her father
wanted to throw out five cats.

Miss Bong Mui Yoke, 33, the teacher in charge of the newsletter, said the
teachers edited the grammar but not the content of the children's
contributions. They also wrote the replies and occasionally took on the role
of an agony aunt.

Miss Bong said: "It is a lot of work but it is a great chance for pupils to
speak their minds.

"They will speak up once they know that there is an audience. Even if it is
the teachers who read it when the work doesn't get published."

Besides the newsletter, the pupils' works are published in class magazines,
the school publications and personal files.

After the final-year examinations, about 40 pupils function as an editorial
team to publish their class magazines.

All these efforts, said Madam Wong, have helped to improve the English
results.

At the Primary School Leaving Examinations, the number of A*/A grades has been
climbing, from about 30 per cent in 1993 to 46 per cent in 1995.

Woman living alone found murdered

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Jasbir Singh

A WOMAN was found dead in her Ang Mo Kio flat on Friday night in a case which
the police have classified as murder.

Madam Karamjeet Kaur, 52, was discovered by her 22-year-old daughter, student
nurse Kavita Pal Kaur, lying on the kitchen floor of her three-room flat at
around 11 pm.

She had deep cuts on her forehead and upper lip.

Madam Karamjeet had been living alone after her mother, Madam Harnam Kaur, and
Miss Kavita moved out of the Ang Mo Kio flat two months ago.

According to Madam Karamjeet's brother, Mr Dhillon J., 42, Miss Kavita visited
the flat that day because she felt that something bad had happened to her
mother after receiving a call from her mother's friend.

Said Mr Dhillon yesterday: "Normally, my sister would call her good friend,
who lives in Kembangan, to chit-chat. But that day she did not."

The friend, who wanted to be identified only as Madam J. Kaur, told The
Straits Times: "It was surprising that on Friday she did not call. Even my
maid was surprised. I tried to call her several times that day but nobody
picked up the phone.

"After trying since morning, I finally told her daughter, Kavita, at around 9
pm to check on her mother."

"I was worried that she may have had an asthma attack," added the 47-year-old
housewife.

"Karamjeet used to call frequently ever since she began to live alone over the
last two months," she said.

The two women have been close friends since childhood.

Miss Kavita's uncle, Mr Mehinder S., 44, said: "She told me that when she
arrived at the flat she found the iron gate unlocked. But the main door was
still securely fastened.

"When she entered the flat she found the whole place ransacked.

"The telephone was disconnected and she found her mother's body lying on the
kitchen floor."

Mr Mehinder is another brother of Madam Karamjeet.

Miss Kavita immediately called the ambulance. Her mother was pronounced dead
by the ambulance team around 11.30 pm.

Police are investigating.

Man posed as cop and tried to extort money

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  In The Courts

A MAN who posed as a police officer was sentenced yesterday to two years' jail
and given four strokes of the cane for attempted extortion.

District Judge F.G. Remedios heard that Mr Rejak, a construction carpenter,
approached Tan Ah Chong, 25, on March 31 and asked for directions. Tan claimed
to be a police officer and told him to go to a nearby void deck.

There he took Mr Rejak's wallet and also demanded money.

He became angry when he found out that Mr Rejak had no money.

He then took his watch.

He also told the construction carpenter to get $200 from his quarters in
exchange for his work permit, which Tan had taken.

When a policeman on patrol duty arrived at the scene, Mr Rejak told him what
had happened.

The policeman arrested Tan after finding Mr Rejak's watch on him.

Tan has five previous convictions for theft, drug consumption, possession of
offensive weapons and fraudulent possession of property.

The maximum punishment for extortion is five years' jail and caning.

86-year-old man sues daughter for return of Tiong Bahru shop

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  In The Courts

By Elena Chong

AN 86-YEAR-OLD man is suing his daughter for the return of a shop in Kim Tian
Road which she said was a gift to her.

Mr Cheng Buck Qui, a former provision shop owner, said in his statement of
claim that he was influenced by his daughter, Madam Cheng Muay alias Cheng Lee
Weng, 54, a housewife, into signing a letter of instruction to a lawyer to
transfer the property to her in June 1990.

A month later, he also signed another document for the property to be
transfered to her for $420,000.

But it is his case that no money was paid. Neither had he given the shop to
her as a gift.

Opening Mr Cheng's case yesterday, counsel Tay San Lee told Judicial
Commissioner Lim Teong Qwee that when his client signed the documents, he did
not have the benefit of independent legal advice, or knew what he was signing.

Mr Cheng had a severe hearing impairment, and was illiterate.

Mr Tay said it was not disputed that his client and his late wife, Madam Koo
Beng Eng, bought the property in 1962 for $36,000.

It was mortgaged to a bank in 1968 to get overdraft facilities for Mr Cheng.

In January 1990, 2-1/2 years after Madam Koo's death, Madam Cheng paid $20,000
to discharge the mortgage on the property.

In June and July 1990, she and her father went to the office of Messrs Peter
Mowe & Partners to sign the papers relating to the transfer of the Kim Tian
Road property, which is off Tiong Bahru Road.

Mr Cheng is seeking a declaration that the transfer be set aside due to the
undue influence of Madam Cheng, who has denied this.

Madam Cheng's case is that her father had intended to transfer the property to
her as a gift, and that the letter that he signed was based on his
instructions to the lawyer.

Cross-examined by Madam Cheng's lawyer, Mr Chandra Mohan, Mr Cheng's adopted
son, 47-year-old cabby Cheng Liang Choon, denied that he had instigated his
father to bring the action against Madam Cheng.

Mr Chandra Mohan had suggested that Liang Choon had hoped that Madam Cheng
would offer some money to her father who would then hand it over to him.

Asked why his father wanted to mortgage the property to obtain a loan, Liang
Choon said his father had no money and wanted to help him as he was indebted.

He said he had stopped his pork rib soup business since end-1994 to look after
his father.

Liang Choon, who obtained a taxi licence four months ago, admitted that he had
lost more than $1 million betting on horses, and that his father used to pay
his gambling debts.

Asked how much his present gambling debts were, he answered that they were
about $100,000.

The hearing continues.

A fine example: At least a third of regular volunteers are 30 or younger /
Children"s Cancer Foundation

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

* MEDICAL officer Tan Hiang Khoon was only 25 years old when, in the course of
his volunteer work with chronically ill children, he heard that parents with
cancer-stricken children had voiced the need for a support group.

Dr Tan, then a houseman, decided to rope in six other young volunteers to help
meet this need. This was five years ago.

Since then, the welfare group they set up -Working in Aid of Leukaemic Kids,
now known as the Children's Cancer Foundation -has grown from strength to
strength.

Dr Tan, now 29 and chairman of the foundation's management committee, said the
foundation served 195 families, compared to only 30 then.

Where previously there were only five volunteer counsellors who worked on an
ad-hoc basis, there are now four full-time social workers and another 15
volunteer counsellors.

Recalling the difficult times then, Dr Tan said: "We had no money, and no
credibility. As a young organisation, it was difficult to convince people to
donate money."

The programmes, he said, were also far from satisfactory.

Counselling services were run completely by volunteers who also had to cope
with their full-time jobs. He said: "The counsellors' main job then was to
offer a listening ear. More serious problems were referred to relevant
agencies."

Now, apart from counselling services and social outings for parents and
children, the foundation also organises parent support groups, workshops and
seminars, and provides financial assistance to families to help bear the costs
of chemotherapy.

Despite his busy work schedule, he still manages to spend an average of five
hours a week working for the foundation.

He said: "Once you get into the system, it becomes a part of your life and a
part of you. I don't feel as if I have to give up other things in my life to
do this work."

At least a third of regular volunteers are 30 or younger: A fine example

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee

Is the post-65 generation concerned only with chasing the five Cs? Recently,
Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law and
Home Affairs, cited the 1990 census report, which found that a higher
proportion of teenagers volunteer for community service than any other age
group. Professor Tommy Koh, Ambassador at Large, also said many were willing
to give up their time to help others. Julie Kee checked the volunteer profile
of seven welfare bodies, and spoke to one young volunteer who helped set up a
charity organisation in his spare time.

Not all young people are materialistic, say welfare groups

NOT all young people are materialistic and concerned only with chasing the
five Cs, said staff members of seven welfare groups The Straits Times
interviewed.

At least one out of three people who volunteer their services regularly at
these welfare bodies are 30 years old or younger -born after 1965.

And in one case, the proportion even goes up to four in five.

This makes them an important manpower resource in a field that is highly
dependent on volunteers, they said.

The post-65 generation forms 47 per cent of Singapore's population, and the
number is estimated at 1.42 million.

The National Council of Social Service, which categorises its volunteers by
their occupations, said that this year, 33.7 per cent of the people who signed
up for its volunteer placement programme were students.

Another 55.1 per cent were working adults and professionals, while housewives
formed 10.7 per cent, and retirees made up 0.5 per cent.

The council found that despite their youth, young volunteers did not restrict
themselves to any particular type of community work.

Ms Theresa Lee, divisional manager of the council's Volunteer Action and
Development Centre, said: "Students generally want to volunteer to work with
children and young people.

"However, we do see a growing interest by students towards working with the
elderly and the disabled."

In the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled in Singapore, (Minds), young
working adults below 30 years old make up half the volunteer pool.

Mr Aaron Ng, executive director of Minds, said that young volunteers were
important because they provided much-needed help in activities which were
labour-intensive.

Their role as volunteers, he said, complemented those in the older age groups
who tended to offer managerial expertise.

In the Singapore Volunteers Overseas Programme run by the Singapore
International Foundation, about one-third of the people who sign up are from
the post-65 generation.

Participants usually take leave of absence or resign from their jobs to serve
as volunteers.

They are paid a living allowance of about $400 a month and sent to developing
countries such as Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam, Botswana and Ghana to provide
humanitarian and technical assistance.

Miss Low Lih Jeng, the programme's assistant director, said: "The spirit of
altruism comes out very strongly.

"If these young people did not come forward, it would definitely have affected
the success of our programme."

On whether today's youth were materialistic, she said: "I think a lot of young
people want to help but it's a matter of balancing work commitments with
volunteer work."

According to Mrs Geri Lau, secretary-general of the Singapore Red Cross
Society, it was not wrong for young people to put a premium on striving hard
in their careers and being competitive.

"This is necessary for a vibrant society," she said.

Troubled Tories hope much from conference: Senior Tory party member
defects

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Neville Stack in London

THE Conservative Party hopes that its last conference before the general
election will be a jolt of adrenaline.

But even the managers, who usually succeed in keeping the conference running
demurely along party lines, will be hard put to disguise the faults that
sunder the party from the Cabinet down.

Add to that the usual crop of financial-sleaze scandals to set Tory tongues
wagging, in private at any rate, and the scenario looks pretty bleak for the
conference, which begins in earnest today in Bournemouth with the arrival of
the Prime Minister.

There have been dozens of critical resolutions tabled on the leadership's
policy over Europe and monetary union. But few will survive the chairman's
pruning knife, and whatever criticisms voiced will be tentative.

The conference, both on the floor and in the side-show meetings, will be
dominated by the issue of Europe and what to do about it.

It is the perceived loss of sovereignty which would follow the adoption of
economic and monetary union (EMU) that is obsessing Conservatives.

Prime Minister John Major, with the support of most of his Cabinet, is keeping
his powder dry prudently (as is opposition leader Tony Blair) and not making
any decisions until he has to. But that does not suit his rebel faction, now
grown to nearly half his parliamentary and grassroots party.

Whipped on by the xenophobic right-wing press, the Europhobes will demand that
he rule out EMU for the life of the next parliament.

He will not concede.

If he does, his Euro-enthusiast Chancellor (Finance Minister) Kenneth Clarke
will resign and set up his own caucus of the Tory left -and that will split
the party asunder and lose it all chances at the general election.

Mr Clarke, a genial verbal bruiser, has told his friends that he will relish
the chance of a conference confrontation with the party dissidents, one that
his high office precludes in the House of Commons.

The Daily Mail's political columnist Simon Heffer is not alone in the media in
taking a sour view of the whole affair.

"In a sensible party, the last conference before an election is used to set
out the programme on which that conference will be fought," he wrote. "In
their highly successful conference at Blackpool, Labour did just that.

"The party that comes to Bournemouth will be immersed instead in a soup of
introspection, flavoured with dollops of defeatism, despair and recrimination
 ... the ideas-free zone that the party has become will disappoint those who
want a new, powerful message to take to the people."

The sub-text to all this manoeuvring is: What happens after the election? That
is the hidden agenda that will dominate the conference.

The polls continue to predict that Labour will sweep in, but wiser heads
-including Mr Blair's -are not so confident. Tory sheep scurry back to the
fold when they scent the Labour wolf.

But assuming the Tory death-wish comes true and it loses, Cabinet ministers
Michael Portillo and Michael Howard will battle with leadership challenger
John Redwood for the hearts and wallets of the right.

Mr Clarke and deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine will line up on the
left, alongside that doughty octogenarian former premier Sir Edward Heath. But
this disregards, as many unwisely do, the Prime Minister's calibre.

Mr Major will point to the rapid improvement in the economy and the standard
of living, Britain's many competitive advantages and the fall in unemployment.
He will be optimistic about the years ahead. He will be wary of Europe's
machinations but not hostile.

He is no charismatic orator, as Tony Blair is. But in his own dogged, steady
way, he is in tune with the millions of similar people in the mythical
constituency called Middle England.

The writer covers European developments and issues for The Straits Times.

Chris Patten"s last hurrah

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

HONGKONG Governor Chris Patten's valedictory address to the Legislative
Council (Legco) last week was expectedly dramatic. It was his last annual
policy address on Hongkong; it was the last any British Governor would make
there; and the forum was no other than the elected Legco, the main point of
contention between the outgoing colonial authorities and China, to which the
territory will revert next year. Beijing, which says that Mr Patten's
electoral reforms violate the 1984 Sino-British treaty on Hongkong, has vowed
to abolish the Legco, elected last year for a four-year term, and replace it
with a provisional chamber. Mr Patten's opposition to the provisional
legislature, and his impassioned defence of the existing one, was summed up in
his question: "How can you have complete faith in the future of the rule of
law if you worry about the integrity of the institution which makes the laws?"

Now, the belief in the need for the rule of law is eminently justified, of
course; the problem lies in equating it with Legco's continued existence. No
one would deny the need for an independent judiciary, which protects not only
the man on the street but also trade and industry, by enforcing contractual
and other legal obligations without which a highly-developed economy is
impossible to sustain. The rule of law also ensures the probity of government
in what is the world's eighth largest trading community. No one would deny the
need for a meritocratic civil service, which administers Hongkong with quiet,
predictable efficiency. Were that efficiency to be subordinated to
extra-professional considerations, the consequences for the territory's way of
life would be seen ultimately in its economic bottomline as well.

Not only is all this true, but also, Beijing knows it as much as the departing
authorities do. But what China knows, and they continue to refuse to accept,
is that their political blueprint for the colony, made in the teeth of
Beijing's opposition, is not the sole repository of these safeguards. The
point is whether the rule of law prevails; to make it conditional on the
continuance of Legco will get Hongkong nowhere. As a matter of principle,
Beijing is opposed to an institution that rejects the spirit and purpose of
the 1984 joint accord. As a matter of practice, it is idle to believe that
China will not carry out its threat to disband Legco. Indeed, the rule of law
existed in Hongkong before the arrival of the elected council. Why, then,
place so much in the care of an institution that was not guaranteed to come
into existence and which is doomed to fail? What is achieved by saying that a
smooth transition in 1997 is not an end in itself, a successful transition, as
smooth as possible, being what is necessary? Why rub in the point by laying
down benchmarks by which others will apparently judge Hongkong after 1997?

More productive were Mr Patten's reference to the fundamentals of Hongkong's
success -the hard work and skill of its people, its beneficent administration
under the rule of law, its openness to the world -and his pledge of assistance
to his successor, the Chief Executive-designate, who is expected to be chosen
by the end of this year. For Hongkong's enduring qualities to thrive after the
handover, it will need to enjoy economic autonomy. The Chief Executive must
ensure, and must be seen to be ensuring, that it does so. To do his job, he
must have China's confidence, because it is this that will give him the
wherewithal to stand up for Hongkong when necessary. What is good is that this
co-operation is only to be expected. Hongkong's autonomy is in the interests
of both the territory and China and, indeed, these interests will converge
even more closely after 1997. This makes it natural for the mainland to let
the territory do business its own way. Hongkong's well-wishers hope that it
will continue on this natural trajectory without political obstacles coming in
the way. Ultimately, its future lies with China.

S46"s self-dissolution -the final episode in 7-year political adventure

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

ON SUNDAY, the Parti Melayu Semangat 46 (S46) general assembly created
political history in Malaysia when it became the first party to pass a motion
for self-dissolution.

This ended its seven-year adventure in the political landscape and paved the
way for its members to rejoin Umno.

Despite the brave talk of party leaders and delegates at the special general
assembly of disbanding in a position of strength, facts seem to suggest that
it faced only two choices: Either reunite with the stronger and more
widely-accepted Umno or slide into political oblivion.

Consider these facts: In the 1990 general elections, a year after it was
formed, S46's candidates managed to win six Parliamentary seats and 12 state
seats.

Five years later, it performed miserably in all states, save for Kelantan,
where S46 candidates won 11 seats on the state assembly.

Even party president Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a Kelantan strongman since the
70s, was not spared the swing in votes.

He won his Gua Musang parliamentary seat on a reduced majority of 4,746 votes,
compared to the 8,980 before.

In his speech at the general assembly, deputy president Datuk Rais Yatim
recognised this erosion of support. Speaking to 500 delegates on Sunday, he
noted that S46 had spent the last few years trying to oppose Umno.

But the party's message and struggle were only effective and accepted in
Kelantan and a few places on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

He said: "From statistics, the two elections gave Umno nearly three million
votes, 440,000 for PAS and 600,000 for S46."

Umno and PAS (Parti Islam) politicians say that the party was headed for a
heavy and potentially crippling defeat at the next elections.

Said an Umno Youth politician: "The euphoria of starting a new party with a
common enemy was getting weaker. This was evident at branch level where many
members had seemed to have lost the fire and crossed over to Umno."

PAS was even more damning in its assessment of the political survival of its
former ally in the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah. Kelantan Mentri Besar Datuk Nik
Aziz Nik Mat, scoffing at S46's chances of denting its hold on the state, told
The Straits Times: "S46 will be lucky if it can win a few seats in the next
elections. If its candidates fight head-on with PAS candidates, it will have
less than 10 seats in the state assembly."

An exaggeration perhaps but observers say that the slightly built religious
teacher was not very far off the mark.

They noted that the main problem with the party was that it had lost much of
its relevance. It was born at a time when Malay politics was at its lowest
ebb.

In 1987, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah challenged Umno president and Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad unsuccessfully for the party president's post.
He then took the matter to court on the ground that some delegates who voted
were ineligible.

A year later, the High Court declared Umno illegal and the main vehicle of
Malay unity was de-registered. Umno Baru was set up by Dr Mahathir while
Tengku Razaleigh formed S46.

Against this backdrop, there were accusations of corruption and money politics
being hurled by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah's camp against Dr Mahathir and his
supporters.

During this time of great disunity, the S46 filled a vacuum for many former
Umno members who felt that the party had lost its way and was not looking
after the interests of the Malays.

There was also a tremendous feeling of sympathy towards S46 after elder Malay
statesmen such as the late Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tun Hussein Onn were
blacklisted and not allowed to join the new Umno.

Two years later, these feelings of anger and frustration turned into protest
votes at the general elections.

In Kelantan, the National Front led by Umno tasted its worst defeat, losing in
all 39 state and 13 parliamentary seats. More importantly, it gave up control
of the east coast state which it had ruled since 1978.

Mr Hassan Harun, an Umno Supreme Council member and a Kelantanese, said: "What
happened in 1990 was a show of anger and protest by the voters. I do not think
that it was because of S46's or PAS' election platform."

Following that election, however, things changed. S46 realised that it was
very much a second-class citizen in the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah in Kelantan,
which it formed with PAS, Berjasa and Hamim.

The Islamic party was slowly exerting control over all policies in the state,
sometimes with total disregard for its ally.

This alienated some S46 leaders such as Datuk Ibrahim Ali, Datin Paduka
Rahimah Osman, Datuk Harun Idris and Ms Marina Yusof, who left the party.

At the same time, under the leadership of Dr Mahathir, the Malaysian economy
soared.

Double-digit economic growth created jobs and opportunities for everyone. A
new breed of Malay entrepreneurs were created, giving the community immense
pride and a larger share of the economy.

The feel-good factor was evident among Malaysians who spurned even traditional
opposition parties such as the DAP (Democratic Action Party) and returned the
National Front to power with a large majority.

Thorny issues of money politics and corruption within Umno were met head-on by
Dr Mahathir. Some party members were expelled after being found guilty of
using money to buy political patronage.

The battle to curb this disease is still very alive with Dr Mahathir banning
all candidates for the Umno elections this week from campaigning.

On Sunday, he told delegates to pick only clean leaders so that the party
could eradicate money politics.

Bit by bit, the raison d'etre of S46 was being chipped away, a fact
acknowledged by Datuk Rais.

He noted: "Our issues and the focus of our struggles between 1987 and 1990 is
not given much weight by Malays. The two elections have proven this fact.

"The change in the environment, the attitude and economic values have played a
role. Economic change has played the main role in changing the view and
struggle of Malays and Malaysians."

Tengku Razaleigh was even more frank. He said: "The reality that Umno is
strong and accepted by the public has to be accepted."

But factors beyond the party's control were only one dimension of the slide in
the party's fortunes. It also suffered from an image problem.

Many of the party' stalwarts were former Umno members who had held federal
ministers' posts. These included Tengku Razaleigh, Datuk Rais and Datuk Manan
Osman.

They were not in the mould of Mr Lim Kit Siang or Mr Karpal Singh and could
not galvanise the opposition or gain wide acceptance as members of the
opposite bench.

In the end, they were neither seen as a National Front party nor as an
effective opposition.

Its stand on the powers of the Malay rulers also alienated a number of its
supporters and the public. When there was a groundswell of feeling against the
excesses of the sultans and when the federal government moved to pass
legislation removing their legal immunity, S46 did not support the motion.

The party stated that the special role of the Malay rulers was important to
protect the rights of the Malays and Islam. However, there was talk that the
rejection of the legislation had more to do with Tengku Razaleigh's close
links to the Kelantan Palace.

The final nail in the coffin was its poor choice of political allies, ranging
from DAP to PAS.

Neither of these parties shared its political goal: to be in the forefront of
Malay nationalism. In fact, PAS eschews nationalism in any form. It regards it
as assabiyah, a form of racism.

Not surprisingly, S46 fell out with its allies. In Kelantan, it was not
consulted on many issues and made to look incompetent.

This year, the PAS-led government decided that all eating shops should be
barred from opening before 3 pm. This did not go down so well with non-Malay
shopkeepers.

Even decisions to ban wayang kulit, carnival rides and unisex hair salons were
not taken in consultation with S46 leaders.

The unpopularity of some of these decisions cost S46 candidates a huge chunk
of non-Malay votes in the 1995 elections.

Worse still, its threats to leave the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah were laughed
off by PAS.

Said Mr Wan Ismail Wan Jusoh, press secretary to the Mentri Besar, Datuk Nik
Aziz: "We do not bow to threats. They were a party on the way down, losing
support on the ground every day."

Seeing the writing on the wall, the leaders decided to dissolve the party and
reunite with Umno.

As Tengku Razaleigh noted: "The party is only a tool to serve and achieve a
higher objective, that is to realise the goals of religion, the race and the
nation."

Committee to allay fears: Internet advisory panel to help fine-tune rules /
National Internet Advisory Committee

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

INTERNET PRIVACY

THE legal sub-committee of the National Internet Advisory Committee will
discuss the issue of privacy in cyberspace, said its chairman Lee Seiu Kin of
the Attorney-General's Chambers.

After a recent case in which a man was fined $61,500 for downloading smut off
the Internet, some Internet users here were concerned that they were being
tracked.

This was despite assurances by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority that
individuals' movements on the Internet were not being monitored.

Mr Lee said: "If many people feel this way, then this will not be good for the
development of the Net so we want to look at how we can allay these concerns."

The deputy director of the AG's Chambers civil and international affairs
divisions said he was in the process of forming the team.

He said it was likely that the legal sub-group would include members from
outside the main committee, who would provide a good balance of ideas.

An avid surfer himself, he often combs the World Wide Web for four or five
hours a night, "to get an idea of what is out there". He also makes use of the
Internet, especially e-mail, in his daily legal work.

He made it clear that he saw the need for some amount of Internet regulation.

He revealed that, at its first meeting a week ago, the committee was shown
some of the pornographic web sites which have been blocked under SBA content
guidelines. He said quite simply: "I wouldn't want my children to see that."

Nonetheless, like his fellow committee members, he sees the Internet as a
potent force to be taken advantage of.

Committee to allay fears

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Raoul Le Blond

THE new National Internet Advisory Committee (NIAC) will look into issues such
as privacy in cyberspace and promote the use of Internet services such as
electronic mail.

It will also help to fine-tune Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) rules
for the Internet here.

The NIAC chairman, Associate Professor Bernard Tan, sketched its directions at
a press conference yesterday.

He said the 19-member group, appointed by the Ministry of Information and the
Arts (Mita) recently for a two-year term, had held its first meeting a week
ago.

The body will look at information provided on the Internet, as well as
electronic bulletin boards.

It will advise the SBA on Internet rules, but would not be involved in the
day-to-day policing, he said.

The rules are aimed at keeping out objectionable content, such as pornography
and politically inflammatory material.

The NIAC will look at the ways Internet usage is affected by the rules, and
whether there is a need to fine-tune them.

"The SBA regulations are not cast in stone," he said. But he stressed that his
committee could only make recommendations.

Prof Tan, who is also the dean of the National University of Singapore's
Science faculty, said that three sub-committees had been formed.

These would gather feedback on users' concerns, and come up with ways to
educate the public on the Internet.

The sub-groups are the:

* Legal sub-committee headed by Mr Lee Seiu Kin, senior state counsel and
deputy head (civil division) and (international affairs division),
Attorney-General's Chambers;

* Industry sub-committee headed by Mr Johnny Moo, group managing director of
Computer Systems Advisors Group;

* Public education subcommittee, led by Mr Tan Yap Kwang, director of the
Education Ministry's planning division.

One of the first areas the NIAC will study is the effect that proxy servers
are having on Internet access here.

Proxy servers are devices, installed in computer networks, which speed up
access to often-accessed Web pages.

They are also used here to block sites which the SBA deems objectionable.

Since Sept 15, Internet Access Service Providers here have required public
subscribers to use proxy servers, prompting some users to complain about
slower access.

Another area that the NIAC would study is promoting the wider use of Internet
services.

Prof Tan said: "While a lot of attention has been focused on the use of the
World Wide Web, we want to encourage the use of electronic mail among the
wider population."

He added that the committee would also work to heighten the public's awareness
about the Internet and its potential.

With its members coming from a broad range of professions -the law, government
bodies, schools and industry -the committee was well-placed to gather
feedback, he said.

There are about 100,000 Internet subscribers here. But equally important were
the views of those who do not use the Internet regularly, such as parents of
children who are avid surfers.

He said much of the discussion about the Internet was misinformed, and that
the committee would work to correct this.

SM Lee, Major hold "very friendly" meeting: Singapore model comes as a
package -take it or leave it

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Neville Stack in London

SENIOR Minister Lee Kuan Yew called on British Prime Minister John Major at
Number 10, Downing Street, yesterday.

Mr Major had returned on Saturday from the European Summit in Dublin and was
preparing to leave for the crucial Conservative Party conference in
Bournemouth.

"Mr Major made great efforts to meet Senior Minister Lee," a diplomatic source
said.

The Straits Times understands that Mr Major was working on the keynote speech
that he will deliver at the Tory conference.

"The meeting was very friendly and constructive and it centred on the growth
of opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region," said a Downing Street source.
"They discussed opportunities for Singapore-British trade."

Mr Lee later met the British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, former
president of the Board of Trade.

And he spoke at a private luncheon of the influential Chairmen's Club at the
Berkeley Hotel.

Mr Lee, who is on a private visit to England, invited Mr Tony Blair, leader of
the opposition Labour Party, to dinner last night.

Today, Mr Lee will give a talk at Asia House, a forum for economic, commercial
and cultural activities linking Asia and Europe.

Let people know what ingredients go into food

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

I REFER to the letter "McDonald's should say how food is cooked" (ST, Aug 28).

I was shocked to learn that beef extract is used for french fries and hash
browns. I am surprised that McDonald's has not responded to date.

Do other fast-food outlets also use beef extract in their cooked food? I also
understand that most cheese contains beef.

Consumers who do not eat beef for religious or health reasons are not aware of
this. They should be told what ingredients go into foodstuff.

5-day week won"t be standard practice in Civil Service

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MS JENNI HO, in her letter "Benefits in shorter work week" (ST, Sept 27),
suggested that Government should take the lead in implementing a five-day week
for civil servants.

The Prime Minister, in response to a question on a five-day week at a forum in
April this year, stated that "... this should be left to the market to decide
and that the Government would not set the tone by allowing the Civil Service a
five-day week and encouraging other employers to do so".

Statistics from the Ministry of Labour show that two-thirds of private-sector
organisations work a 5.5-day week or even longer. The table (right) gives the
1995 work-week figures for clerical, sales, service, production and related
employees.

The Civil Service will not adopt a five-day work-week as a standing practice.

But ministries may adopt flexible work-week arrangements where this will
improve the level of service to the public.

For example, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has extended its
service hours to full-day operation on Saturdays. The roster for the six-day
service is such that counter officers work five days a week, including
alternate Saturdays.

Many supervisors turn up for work every Saturday as their staff are on duty.

THE reply from the Land Transport Authority (ST, Oct 4) in response to
readers' views on the irresponsible road behaviour of cyclists on our roads is
lame, to say the least.

It ignores the concerns of many road users, who wonder whether cyclists have
to follow traffic regulations or not. Is the number of accidents involving
cyclists not high enough yet for a proper response?

Ignorance of traffic regulations among cyclists is so prevalent that it is not
uncommon to see Neighbourhood Police Post members making their rounds at night
without a lamp on their bicycles or riding two abreast!

As cyclists tend to ride along pedestrian footpaths and pedestrian crossings,
would the LTA please give a clear and unequivocal reply?

Police will take action against reckless cyclists

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

WE WOULD like to thank the writers of the letters "Cyclists here seem to defy
rules and safety" (ST, Sept 27), "Make safe cycling easier" and "Most cycles
are not fitted with bells" (ST, Sept 30) for their feedback.

In our news release on the accident situation for the first half of this year,
we raised our concern over cyclists, particularly cyclists who are reckless
and behave irresponsibly on the roads.

We take a serious view of such conduct and will not hesitate to take action
against them.

The Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules require, for example, that all bicycles
should have a front lamp and a rear red light or reflector during hours of
darkness.

They also require that bicycles must be ridden in an orderly manner and with
due regard for the safety of others. Action has always been taken against
cyclists who flout these rules.

As for the suggestion to educate cyclists, the Traffic Police have, since
1981, trained primary schoolchildren on safe cycling at the Road Safety Park
at the East Coast Parkway.

Some 10,000 schoolchildren who attend these programmes each year are taught,
among other things, to obey signals and signs to ride safely, and to put on
proper riding attire. The students also play a traffic game simulating road
situations and are given "demerit points" if they fail to comply with the
traffic rules.

Road safety talks are conducted at schools, community clubs and other
grassroots organisations. We will continue to place emphasis on education and
explore new ways to undertake this.

The Traffic Police are monitoring closely the accident rate involving cyclists
and will continue with their enforcement action. In the meantime, we would
like to remind all cyclists to keep to the traffic laws for their own safety,
as well as that of other road-users.

Exempt some donations entirely from estate duty

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

I REFER to your articles (ST, Oct 4) on Mr C.J. Koh's donation of $2 million
to the Universities Endowment Fund.

Although it has been well publicised that the donation is tax-deductible, I
wonder if it is equally well known that such donations would not be exempt
from estate duty if the gift was made during the donor's lifetime unless he
survives for one year after the time of the gift (in the case of a gift to a
public or charitable institution).

Otherwise, the money donated is deemed under the law to still belong to the
donor at the time of his death, and estate duty is chargeable accordingly.

For gifts to non-public or non-charitable institutions, the time frame is five
years.

Under the Estate Duty Act, estate duty is not payable only for gifts of money
to the National Museum; other than that only bequests to five institutions are
exempt from duty. The National University of Singapore is one of the five,
although strangely enough, the Nanyang Technological University is not.

The term "bequest" means that it must be a gift under a will, to be given
after death. Hence gifts during the lifetime of the donor are not exempt.
Therefore, the donor's estate would be liable for estate duty if the donor
dies within the year!

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), it is
provided that estate duty could be recovered from the recipient of the gift.
In the case of a gift to a charity, it seems to me that it defeats the purpose
of the gift if the recipient is required to pay the estate duty.

This leads me to wonder whether the Estate Duty Act should be amended to
exempt totally from estate duty gifts to any public or charitable institution
regardless of when the gifts were made. A bolder move could be to abolish
estate duty altogether as Malaysia did several years ago.

Perhaps this could spur more donations and help the Universities Endowment
Fund meet its $1 billion target more easily and quickly as the Fund will not
have to wait till the demise of donors before getting the donations.

GRCs : Amendment Bill may be unconstitutional

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

ARTICLE 12 (2) of the Republic of Singapore Constitution provides that "except
as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination
against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or
place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment
under a public authority ..."

This provision is in fact qualified by Article 39A which provides that GRCs
may be formed "in order to ensure the representation in Parliament of members
from the Malay, Indian and other minority communities ..."

Another qualification to this is to be found in Article 152(1) which provides
that "it shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for
the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore".

These are all very sound rules to ensure that no one particular majority will
ever come to oppress the minorities in Singapore.

When Mr Lim Boon Heng, Minister without Portfolio, put forward the GRC
proposal in 1987, its objective clearly was to give effect to the Government's
duty to protect minority interests in Singapore.

It was a laudable effort and a sound attempt to maintain the racial and
religious harmony in the country.

However, when the Prime Minister decided recently to introduce an Amendment
Bill (which would become an Act of Parliament or "law" if passed by Parliament
and assented to by the President) to Article 39A, the manifest intention was
to facilitate the institutionalisation of community development councils.

It is this novel rationale that may result in the constitutionality of the
Amendment Bill being suspect.

This issue must be examined carefully prior to the General Election, for it
carries with it serious consequences. Article 4 of our Constitution states
clearly that any "law" which is inconsistent with the Constitution is void.

Prima facie, the GRC concept goes against the equality of race principle
embodied in Article 12(2). The only reason the GRC scheme exists, since its
introduction in 1987, is that the GRC concept seeks to protect the minority
interest (as empowered by Articles 39A and 152(1) respectively). This, as I
pointed out, is of course desirable and legitimate. However, can the same
noble aspirations be ascribed to the recently proposed Amendment Bill?

The Prime Minister's Amendment Bill seeks to decrease the minority
representation in the GRCs from one-quarter to one-sixth. Can this Bill ever
be described sensibly as "to care for the interests of the racial and
religious minorities" under Article 152(1)?

Similarly, since the Prime Minister has already stated openly that the Bill
was introduced to create the necessary critical mass for the CDCs to work, can
this rationale be described sensibly as "in order to ensure the representation
in Parliament of members from the Malay, Indian and other minority
communities" under Article 39A?

If the answers to the above two questions are "no", this Amendment Bill -even
if passed by Parliament -will be struck down by the courts as void for being
unconstitutional. It will certainly be a prima facie contravention of the
"equality of races" principle embodied in Article 12.

It will similarly be outside the scope of either Article 39A or Article
152(1), and will therefore remain void since it does not appear to be an
exceptional case sanctioned by Article 39A or Article 152(1).

The only way to preserve the GRCs' legitimacy is to maintain the present
rationale to protect minority interests without any other extraneous
considerations concerning the CDCs. Consequential to this, the number of MPs
in each GRC should not be increased, otherwise the proportion of minority MPs
would decrease, thus derogating from the original objective of Article 39A.

I may be wrong in my assessment of the legality/constitutionality of this
Bill, but I beg the Prime Minister's indulgence in re-examining it carefully
in order to avoid any unnecessary quagmire. The nation's stability might well
be at stake should Parliament be forced to dissolve as a result.

Bourse fails to rally on back of Wall Street gains: Dow breaches 6,000 for
first time in early trading

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  Market Report

By Tan Li Eng

THE expected firming of the Singapore bourse on the back of strong Wall Street
gains last Friday failed to materialise, as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index sank 22.2 points to 2,126.66.

Dealers attributed the bearishness to sustained underweighting activity and
poor sentiment.

"The climb in the Dow is not to our advantage because more money will be
poured into the US market rather than the Asian markets, said a dealer with a
foreign brokerage. "Most of the liquidity will be sucked out to the US
market."

Even market newcomer Easyknit International Holdings was not spared the
adverse sentiment, suffering the ignominy of becoming the second offering to
debut below its offer price in a week.

Shares in the Hongkong-based garment manufacturer dropped 5 per cent below its
initial public offer price. It dipped as low as HK$2.60 in intra-day trading,
with 1.74 million shares changing hands, before closing at HK$2.90.

On Friday, Pacific Andes (Holdings) shares fell 6 per cent below its offer
price of 57 US cents. Yesterday, it continued to drift further, ending three
cents down at 50.5 US cents.

Property stocks as a whole also fell, with the SES Properties Index tumbling
12.02 points to 644.59.

News that third quarter private property transactions plunged by 75 per cent
from the previous quarter and comments by Minister for National Development
Lim Hng Kiang that property prices would "adjust downward" over the next six
months further eroded sentiment, said dealers.

City Developments dropped 40 cents to $10.80 on 1.2 million shares traded,
Wing Tai fell two cents to $3.42 on 2.4 million shares, while DBS Land eased
10 cents to $4.52 on 1.3 million shares.

Singapore Telecommunications was down 10 cents to $3.10, its lowest level in
nearly three weeks.

The dismal trading story repeated itself across the causeway, as the benchmark
Kuala Lumpur Composite Index fell 1.68 points to 1,148.5. The Second Board
index fell 12.27 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 558.97.

"The 12-point drop on the Second Board may have caused quite a bit of jitters
on the Malaysian side," said a remisier.

But over-the-counter stocks dominated volumes and gainers here and the UOB-OTC
index closed up 2.89 points at 1,191.82.

MBf Holdings topped the turnover list, rising two cents to 62.5 cents on 3.44
million shares. Technology Resources Industries Bhd was the top gainer,
soaring 32 cents to $4.02.

Volume was 77.6 million shares worth $229.2 million compared to 92.04 million
units worth $216.48 million last Friday. Losers swamped gainers 221 to 93,
with 249 stocks unchanged. -TAN LI ENG.

August manufacturing output dwindles 7.6%

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

SINGAPORE'S manufacturing output shrank 7.6 per cent in August, with the
critical electronics industry recording a 5.1 per cent fall in output from a
year ago.

"The output of chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, petrochemical and
specialty chemicals), transport equipment, plastic products and petroleum
industries also declined," the Economic Development Board (EDB) said
yesterday.

Only industrial chemicals and gases and electrical machinery did not suffer
falls in output during the month, according to the EDB's industrial production
index. The sectors grew 2.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively.

Cumulative manufacturing output for the first eight months of this year grew
6.4 per cent year-on-year, the board said, with cumulative electronics output
growth of 12.6 per cent.

The poorest performers were the paints and pharmaceuticals and transport
equipment sectors, whose output fell 24.6 per cent and 18.5 per cent
respectively.

Output of plastic products and fabricated metal products slowed in line with
the decline in the electronics industry, falling 15.5 per cent and 7.2 per
cent respectively.

The petroleum industry's output fell 9.2 per cent "due to lower output by a
major refinery which experienced technical start-up problems after its
shutdown for maintenance in July".

The printing and publishing industry declined 3.7 per cent because of reduced
orders from the commercial print media.

The poor manufacturing output figures had been anticipated after August's
worse-than-expected 6.3 per cent fall in non-oil domestic exports.

Commenting on those numbers two weeks ago, Trade and Industry Minister Yeo
Cheow Tong said the Singapore economy was "on track" to achieve the 7 to 8 per
cent economic growth forecast for this year.

He added that, based on feedback from industry, the Government expected to see
some recovery in the electronics sector in the first six months of next year.

Slower property investment sales in third quarter

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kalpana Rashiwala

But sales so far this year hit record $9b

PROPERTY investment sales in the third quarter slowed 17 per cent from the
preceding three months, due mainly to slower sales of land for residential
development, particularly in the private sector.

Nonetheless, investment sales for the first nine months of this year reached
$9.3 billion -exceeding the record $7.7 billion chalked up for the whole of
last year, according to Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) figures.

Investment sales of property refer to purchases of development sites and en
bloc sales, not single units bought by consumers. They are used as a gauge of
developers' confidence in the mediumto long-term prospects of the property
market.

Total investment sales fell in the July-September period to $2.5 billion -from
$2.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.9 billion in the first quarter.

The third quarter saw lower proceeds from sales of residential development
sites -by both the state and private sector. The combined figure for the third
quarter was $1.2 billion, down 30 per cent from $1.7 billion in the second
quarter and a heftier 43 per cent from $2.1 billion during January to March
this year.

Government sales of housing plots in the third quarter totalled $731 million
-compared with $837 million and $1.6 billion in the second and first quarters
respectively.

Sales of private development sites -which include en bloc or collective sales
of apartments with redevelopment potential -came off even more dramatically in
the third quarter, falling 46 per cent to $470 million from the second
quarter's $881 million. However, the figure was not far off the $488 million
in the first quarter.

"Sales of residential development sites still contributed 49 per cent to
overall investment sales for the quarter," noted JLW executive director Steven
Choo.

However, this was lower than 54.7 per cent and 58.3 per cent for the first and
second quarters respectively.

Analysts had expected the drop in investment sales of residential plots,
particularly in the private sector.

Said UBS Securities senior research analyst Soon Ching Voon: "Since the
mid-May property curbs were introduced, there had been many land tenders,
mostly en bloc sales, for which results have not been announced, including
properties in the Dunearn and Upper Thomson areas.

"It probably means that the owners found the bids below their reserve prices,
or perhaps for some of the sites, no bids may have been received.

"Developers have become cautious." Analysts said the drop in sales of
government residential sites had more to do with the timing of the sales.

They noted that on the whole, the Government had been committed to increasing
residential land supply.

"However, tender prices have come off about 10-15 per cent since the property
curbs," noted Mr Soon.

There was a pick-up in sales of en bloc commercial properties in the third
quarter.

The Promenade along Orchard Road and Cockpit Hotel together with an adjoining
site changed hands last month for nearly $271 million and $380 million
respectively.

Dr Choo noted that several freehold bungalow and condominium sites, such as
City Mansions at Paterson Road, had been put on the market.

"Paradoxically, the current softer sentiment may help to make deals as both
buyers and sellers are more realistic about their expectations," he said.

GE Life sales agents protest against plan to cut commission / Great Eastern
Life

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE guild representing Great Eastern Life's sales representatives yesterday
spoke out against proposed cuts in their commissions.

Mr Mohd Amin, president of the GE Life Sales Representatives' Guild, told a
press conference: "It is a short-sighted policy to cut where it is easiest to
cut. It's killing the goose that lays the golden egg."

GE Life decided last month to reduce commissions for its 4,700 agents by an
average of 20 per cent from Jan 1 due to declining investment income.

Set against a competitive marketplace and low interest rates, the options open
to the management were cutting costs and raising returns on investments.

GE Life said in a rebuttal yesterday that the commission changes were
implemented so that its product cost structure will be in line with that of
the industry.

"Given the long-term nature of the life insurance investment, the company
needs to take prudent measures to safeguard the long-term interests of
policy-holders," it said.

The company also needs to ensure that its investment yield will be consistent
with the industry's long-term performance. It is hiring a chief investment
officer to oversee its investments.

Mr Amin said it was no fault of the agents that investment yields had been
below the industry average. Yet, the agents had to bear the brunt of reduced
remuneration. "We hope they will rethink the firm's overall strategy and not
treat us as scapegoats," he added.

Guild member Mervyn Goh pointed out that the company had been able to sustain
commissions for the past five years, when returns on investments were 4-6 per
cent.

He asked why, if GE Life could project a 7 per cent rate of return, it could
not maintain the established commission rates.

The guild claims that the company's proposed changes involved cuts in agents'
remuneration of between 15 and as much as 60 per cent on certain pay packages
-more than the average 15 to 25 per cent range mentioned by the company.

Changes in the agency structure hinder career advancement, it claimed. "Agents
may be demoted, become part-time agents, leave the company or industry
altogether," it warned.

However, the guild had encouraged its 3,565 agents and managers to stay on
with GE Life while it resolves matters with the management.

Guild representatives said they hoped press publicity will help clarify
matters and restore confidence in the company and that the management will
respond by withdrawing the proposed package.

They said their request to discuss the matter with GE Life's newly appointed
chief executive officer Tan Beng Lee had fallen on deaf ears, but GE Life said
there has been open dialogue.

Mr Justin Lee, honorary secretary of the guild, said the company's suggestion
-that agents change their strategy to promote more life policies to cushion
potential losses in earnings -was "improper and uncalled for".

The guild has, therefore, written to the Insurance Commissioner about their
concerns that this suggestion runs contrary to the code of conduct set out in
their agency agreement.

Delifrance issuing 45.16m shares at 78<c> apiece in IPO / Delifrance Asia,
SES, Stock Exchange of Singapore

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Freddie Ng

HOT on the heels of recent initial public offerings, French delicatessen chain
Delifrance Asia yesterday launched its IPO of 45.16 million shares at 78 cents
each for a mainboard listing.

At 78 cents, the offer shares of par value 10 cents each are being issued at a
historical price-earnings (PE) ratio of 17.26 times.

The public offer consists of 29.9 million new shares and 15.26 million vendor
shares, which are stock sold by the company's existing shareholders.
Delifrance will not have a placement tranche.

The public offer, representing 25 per cent of the company's enlarged share
capital, will yield net proceeds of about $21.7 million. Up to 10 per cent of
the offered shares will be reserved for the group's management, staff and
business associates.

According to Delifrance, $10 million of the net proceeds will be used to
upgrade and establish production facilities in Singapore, Philippines,
Australia, Malaysia, Hongkong and China.

Expansion of retail outlets in Singapore, Hongkong, Malaysia and Australia
will take up another $8 million and $3.7 million will be used as working
capital.

Analysts polled by The Straits Times generally agreed that Delifrance's main
strength was its highly visible trade name, which bodes well for its IPO.

They were, however, split on whether the relatively steep PE ratio of 17.26
times was too high.

One analyst from a local research house said the ratio was not high compared
to other food counters like Cerebos, Fraser & Neave and QAF Ltd which were all
currently trading at more than 30 times.

Two other analysts, however, said they had expected the ratio to be closer to
15 times.

Analysts also cited as a potential downside Delifrance's exposure to price
fluctuations of wheat flour and butter, the basic ingredients of its bakery
products.

Delifrance Asia has grown considerably over the past five years. The group
reported net profits of $6.8 million on sales of $98.5 million for the year
ended June. In 1992, it recorded $1.6 million net profit on sales of $37.1
million.

Delifrance, a subsidiary of French flour miller J-L Vilgrain Group, set up
shop here in 1983. It has cafes and takeaway outlets in Asia, which make and
sell French bakery products.

This, said one analyst, was good for the group because it would enjoy lower
business costs resulting from the vertical upstream activities.

The IPO, which is lead managed and underwritten by OCBC Bank, closes on Oct 17
and trading on a "when issued" basis starts on Oct 21.

STIC to begin work on Wuxi park"s third phase by next September / Singapore
Technologies Industrial Corporation, STIC

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Tammy Tan

SINGAPORE Technologies Industrial Corp (STIC) expects to embark on the third
phase of its Wuxi-Singapore Industrial Park (WSIP) project in China by
September next year.

The next stage of development was expected to add another 100 hectares of land
to the China project, STIC executive vice-president Goh Song How said in a
recent interview.

Phase one, covering 100 hectares, was completed in June and work on the 135 ha
second phase is underway and slated for completion by next year. Mr Goh said a
team of WSIP officials had started on the master plan for phase three of the
industrial park.

"As soon as the master planning is ready, our guys can go and start marketing
it. We have already completed the preliminary master plan and will probably
finish it by early next year," he said.

WSIP, which is lead managed by STIC, has incurred a total development cost of
US$120 million (S$169 million) to date. Other stakeholders in the development
include the Wuxi government, JTC International Ltd and KMP China Investments
Pte.

Yesterday, the developers announced that 11 new tenants had been signed on.
They will invest collectively an additional US$115 million, increasing total
funding by park tenants to US$430 million. Ten of the 11 tenants will take up
land plots ranging from one to eight hectares for their plants.

The park has a total of 36 committed tenants. Of these, 17 have begun
operations, including Seagate Technology, Siemens Components and Sumitomo
Electric.

They will employ a total of 6,000 workers by the end of the year and will
account for a total production value of almost US$200 million this year.

According to Mr Goh, occupancy rates for WSIP have been good. Phase one is
almost occupied fully while the second stage is nearly 40 per cent taken up.

He said there were no plans to embark on a fourth phase of development yet,
although the consortium had an option to develop up to 1,000 hectares of land.

"It's all a question of supply and demand. We have to stagger the development
plan to meet the demand," he said.

WSIP, which is one of three overseas industrial park projects STIC is
developing, incurred a small loss in the first half of this year. It is,
however, expected to generate profits by the end of the year.

TRI pays $63m for 15% stake in US satellite firm / Technology Resources
Industries, TRI, Orbcomm Global LP

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MALAYSIAN-LISTED Technology Resources Industries Bhd (TRI) has invested US$45
million (S$63.4 million) for a 15 per cent stake in US satellite
communications company Orbcomm Global L.P.

It has also been appointed Orbcomm's first service licensee in South-east
Asia, with rights to distribute Orbcomm services in Malaysia, Singapore and
Brunei itself or through resellers.

"Another US$7 million to US$8 million will be invested to build an Orbcomm
Gateway earth station and message processing centre in Malaysia, expected to
be completed in late 1997," TRI vice-president of new ventures Azhar Asmuni
told a news conference here.

The US$330 million Orbcomm system is the world's only operational low-earth
orbit (LEO) satellite system which enables subscribers to send and receive
short messages and identify their positions anywhere on earth at low cost,
said Orbcomm president Alan Parker.

Applications and services supported by the system include person-to-person
emergency communications, remote industrial asset and environmental
monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery, truck tracking and communications, and
two-way e-mail links through personal portable subscriber communicator units.

"Through the earth station in Malaysia, subscribers in Singapore, Malaysia and
Brunei will be able to obtain Orbcomm services in 1998," said Mr Azhar.

The Orbcomm system's two orbiting satellites serve about 350,000 subscribers
in the US with its limited communications capability, said Mr Parker.
"Real-time data communication will be available when 26 additional satellites
are launched and deployed next year."

He estimated the potential global market at 168 million subscribers, of which
one-third are in the Asia-Pacific. "For the most part, this market is unserved
or underserved by any other telecommunications technology."

Orbcomm Global L.P. is a partnership owned by Orbital Sciences Corporation in
the US, Teleglobe Inc of Canada and TRI.

Quokka subsidiary buys Southcorp"s Rheem division / Quokka Investments,
Rheem Concrete Industry Product, Cesco Australia

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Florence Chong in Sydney

A WHOLLY owned subsidiary of Australian-listed Quokka Investments -which is 47
per cent controlled by Singapore-based Zicom Pte Ltd -has acquired Rheem
Concrete Industry Product (Rheem CIP), a division of the diversified
industrial group, Southcorp Holdings Ltd.

Cesco Australia Ltd paid an undisclosed sum for the purchase of the business
in a deal finalised last Wednesday.

Rheem CIP's new owners planned to expand exports into new markets in Asia,
said the company's general manager (commercial), Mr Michael Mee.

Rheem CIP manufactures, markets and distributes transit concrete mixers under
the trade-name "Rheem-Vulcan" and "Vulcan".

More than two-thirds of its production of 900 units a year are exported
through Zicom Pte Ltd, mostly to Singapore, with some products also going to
Thailand, according to a statement by Zicom group managing director and Cesco
Australia managing director Sim Giok Lak.

"We plan to increase our exports into other Asian countries in the next two to
three years," he said.

Mr Mee said the company intended to export its concrete mixers to China early
next year. It would probably export to Malaysia and Indonesia later in the
year.

Rheem CIP plans to double production to 1,800 units a year in three years'
time. The export value of the output would be A$40 million (S$44 million). Its
current turnover is less than A$20 million a year.

Mr Sim also disclosed Zicom's plan to establish a joint venture in Malaysia
next year. The company has tie-ups in China, Thailand and Indonesia. "We plan
to assemble Vulcan transit concrete mixer in all these countries," he said.

Quokka, based in Perth, is a property and investment company with interests in
Australia and Singapore.

Its major shareholder is Zicom, which is also the company's single largest
overseas customer.

Scotts hearing told about new documents / Scotts Holdings, Scotts
Investments (Singapore) Pte Ltd

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

NEW documents have surfaced which might invalidate the transfer of listed
Scotts Holdings shares to the holding company of the controlling Jumabhoy
family, the High Court was told yesterday.

The documents show that the grandson of family patriarch Rajabali Jumabhoy was
a trustee of a settlement he had made in 1957, it was claimed at the start of
a six-week hearing of a suit filed by Mr Rajabali against three relatives and
the family holding company.

The 98-year-old Mr Rajabali is seeking to restore the benefits of his assets
to the entire family.

Mr Rajabali's lawyer Lim Chor Pee told the court that because Mr Asad
Jumabhoy, as trustee, had not executed the transfer form in respect of Scotts
Holdings shares transferred to the family company, Scotts Investments
(Singapore) Pte Ltd (SIS), the transfer was not valid.

Mr Lim said that, in fact, the trustees were not empowered to transfer Scotts
Holdings shares to SIS and their action constituted a breach of the 1957
settlement.

Earlier, lead counsel Mr Harry Wee, told Justice Judith Prakash that Mr
Rajabali was not claiming any money from the plaintiffs but that he was
seeking only to enforce the settlement made in 1957, whereby the benefits of
all his assets would go to all members of the family.

Mr Rajabali filed a suit a year ago along with his sons Yusuf and Mustafa,
daughter Perin, and grandchildren Anwar, Faez and Saleem.

The defendants are his eldest son, Mr Ameerali R. Jumabhoy, who resigned last
month as executive chairman of listed property and hospitality group Scotts
Holdings, grandsons Rafiq and Iqbal, former managing director and executive
director respectively of the company, and SIS, which owns 42.5 per cent of the
listed entity.

Mr Rajabali's main contention is that the family assets have been taken
control of by the Ameerali branch of the family.

In a day-long presentation, Mr Lim said that in 1957, Mr Rajabali made a
settlement of his property, No. 8 Scotts Road, in favour of his four children.

The object was to ensure that the property or its sale proceeds were not
distributed, but rather invested and the income accumulated for the benefit of
the beneficiaries.

The family formed Scotts Holdings Pte Ltd to develop their Scotts Road
property. The company was subsequently listed on the Stock Exchange of
Singapore.

But the Ameerali branch of the family went ahead to pledge Scotts Holdings
shares to banks to finance activities of other companies, contrary to the
intentions of Mr Rajabali, Mr Lim told the court.

At the start of the hearing yesterday, Mr Rajabali was in court along with
most of the other plaintiffs.

It has taken a battery of lawyers from Chor Pee & Company, representing the
plaintiffs; Drew & Napier, representing Ameerali and Iqbal; Allen & Gledhill,
representing Rafiq and Rajah & Tann, acting for SIS, a year to prepare for the
hearing.

Documents relating to the case run into 28 volumes.

The hearing continues today.

Issues, rather than insults, take centre stage in lively debate: "Clinton
parries Dole"s debate offensive", "Round One to Clinton-Careful, contained
and mainly cautious"and "Round One to Clinton-Critiques and the occasional
bit of wit"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lee Siew Hua in Cincinnati, Ohio

IT WAS a night of issues, not insults, as US President Bill Clinton and his
challenger, Mr Bob Dole, faced each other in a debate which was far livelier
than expected and could help tighten the race in the days before the election
next month.

The 90-minute debate brought the defining campaign issues of tax cuts and
stronger, safer families -elements of a gigantic spectrum of plans which will
affect Americans as they step gingerly into the next millennium -intimately
into the living rooms of an estimated 90 million people.

In reality, both candidates were not strikingly different on a number of
positions. Both proposed tax cuts, though in different forms and proportions.

Both emphasised education, with Mr Clinton citing his support for a
progressive array of school programmes and his rival arguing that authority
should now devolve from Washington to parents and schools. Mr Clinton, who has
shifted towards centrist politics during his presidency, has already been
tough on crime and has also sought to downsize government, both traditional
Republican concerns.

But rather than spend time on repeating those central messages, both men
sought to stress the subtle issue of trust.

Each tried to persuade voters that he could be entrusted with the major task
of building a bridge to the 21st century.

Mr Dole also sought to cast doubt on the President's trustworthiness, albeit
in a civil way and with touches of wit.

The challenger said that the President was scaring senior citizens by implying
that he would cut Medicare.

He also noted that Mr Clinton was prone to exaggerating his presidential
successes, accused the incumbent of being a closet liberal and summoned up
briefly the Whitewater spectre.

In many ways, Mr Dole relied on a highly negative strategy in the debate,
though softening this with anecdotes which attempted to show his compassion.

Mr Clinton, quick-thinking and a master of detail, sought to show that he was
a man of character who had kept his word on lifting the economy, reforming
welfare, fighting crime and other successes.

Overall, the debate was close but was more critical for Mr Dole as it had been
regarded widely as his last chance to win over undecided voters and shrink his
opponent's substantial lead, averaging 12-15 per cent since the campaign
began.

Mr Clinton shone. The challenger shone too -but partly because expectations of
him had sunk so low.

Mr Dole did manage to show during the face-off that he would make a plausible
president. But many will question if that is enough to unseat an incumbent
presiding over an economic success story in a non-war situation.

Polls suggest that most Americans have already made up their minds. Still,
swing voters will have another chance to make a side-by-side comparison during
the next debate -in San Diego on Oct 16 -which will use a cosier town-hall
format in which the incumbent excels.

Round One to Clinton -Critiques and the occasional bit of wit: "Issues,

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

How the two presidential candidates faced up to each other

US President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole drew sharp
distinctions in their appraisal of current world and national conditions on
Sunday night in the first televised debate of the 1996 campaign, outlining
different visions of the next four years.

Three polls conducted immediately after the 90-minute encounter, held in
Connecticut, showed that Mr Clinton won the debate. Here is a look at how they
performed.

HITS

* He maintained a steady critique of the President from beginning to end,
defining his challenger's posture crisply, snapping out critiques and easing
up to find the occasional bit of humour.

* His opening was more personal, designed to wipe away impressions of him as
negative or harsh, but did not lay out a vision of where he wanted to take the
country.

* He was forceful in criticising Mr Clinton's foreign policy and his record on
the economy.

* He demonstrated a mastery of the details of government that easily matched
Mr Clinton's.

* He scored several times with his humour, teasing the President about his
weight and his cholesterol and himself about his fall from a campaign platform
in California. He showed he is not just a grumpy old man, as some have said.

* Viewers also saw Mr Dole's wit -a trademark of his Senate career but rarely
seen on the 1996 campaign trail.

* He made an effort throughout the debate to portray himself as a caring,
compassionate person, whose war wounds and family poverty had made sensitive
to the needs of people with problems.

MISSES

* Democrats contended that Mr Dole's negative tone, which became more apparent
as the debate wore on, would come back to haunt him.

* He barely mentioned the economic boom that his supply-side running-mate,
Jack Kemp, contends would be set off by the Republicans' 15 per cent tax cut,
and he said little about revolutionary change in the federal tax code.

* He had trouble poking holes in Mr Clinton's economic record.

US President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole drew sharp
distinctions in their appraisal of current world and national conditions on
Sunday night in the first televised debate of the 1996 campaign, outlining
different visions of the next four years.

Three polls conducted immediately after the 90-minute encounter, held in
Connecticut, showed that Mr Clinton won the debate. Here is a look at how they
performed.

HITS

* His opening statement set the tone for much of the debate. He was upbeat and
future-oriented, claiming the nation had made progress under his leadership
and that he needed four more years to continue the job.

* He made his case calmly and with good humour, stating a credo that reflected
his rediscovered centrism of the last year or so: "I believe the purpose of
politics is to give people the tools to make the best of their own lives."

* So that he would appear more presidential, he avoided engaging his opponent
directly on most issues, preferring to state his own position without
referring directly to Mr Dole's charges.

* He kept his tongue when Mr Dole smilingly compared him to "the great
exaggerator", the senator's dead brother, Kenny. "Kenny was a great talker,
and he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate. So we had a
rule, we divided by six -in your case maybe just two."

* His style emphasised butterfly over bee, a smile over umbrage, as when he
grinned in meeting the expected assertion from Mr Dole that "liberal" is the
only accurate description of the President.

* His performance was much like his campaign has been: careful, contained and
generally cautious.

MISSES

* He had little that was fresh to offer, returning several times to the
metaphor he has ridden hard since the Democratic convention, the now-famous
"bridge to the 21st Century".

* "The President was on the defensive, and that was a strategic mistake, "
said Senator Connie Mack, Republican-Florida, one of Mr Dole's debate
advisers.

CPIB nabs two linked to Amcol"s Mauritius deal / Amcol Holdings, Sando &
Cie

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

TWO men were arrested by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB)
last week in connection with Amcol Holdings' aborted multimillion-dollar
project in Mauritius.

Both men have been released, each on bail of $500,000.

Meanwhile, Amcol, its Mauritian joint-venture partner Sando & Cie, and
Mauritian businessman Roland Maurel have entered recently into a fresh
agreement in which Mr Maurel agreed to buy out Amcol's 40 per cent stake in
the Mauritian venture.

Price Waterhouse had pointed out in its report that the company seemed to have
overpaid US$14 million (S$19.7 million) for its stake.

Over on the Indian Ocean island, the controversial project had caused a public
uproar. This led Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam to order a probe by
a high-powered fact-finding team, chaired by an influential retired Chief
Justice.

In August, Amcol's interim judicial managers had sued former Amcol executive
directors Lloyd Lochra and Ng Chee Kheong for "secret commissions and/or
bribes received in connection with Project Mauritius".

The suit was related to three separate payments of US$300,000 (about
S$423,000) by Sando & Cie, which were mentioned in a report on Amcol by Price
Waterhouse.

The interim judicial managers also obtained a court injunction to freeze the
assets worldwide of Mr Lochra, who is an American.

Easyknit falls short of issue price on market debut / Easyknit
International Holdings Ltd

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MAINBOARD-LISTED garment exporter Easyknit International Holdings yesterday
became the second initial public offering (IPO) in the past week to close
below its issue price on its trading debut.

It ended its first day of trading at HK$2.90, 15 HK cents below its HK$3.05
issue price.

Easyknit's share price dipped to as low as HK$2.60 in intra-day trading, with
a total of 1.75 million shares changing hands.

Last Friday, another mainboard debutante, frozen seafood producer Pacific
Andes (Holdings), had closed 3.5 US cents below its offer price of 57 US cents
on its first trading day.

A dealer attributed the poor performance of the Hongkong-based garment maker
and exporter to the fact that "Singapore is simply not the choice market at
the moment".

Furthermore, said another dealer, the stock market was averse to foreign
currency-denominated listings, preferring instead to stick to Singapore-dollar
counters.

Besides closing below its issue price, the public tranche of Easyknit's IPO
was 70 per cent undersubscribed at its close last Monday.

However, all 25 million placement shares offered were taken up.

Easyknit's IPO fared worse than the only other undersubscribed offering this
year. Home decor distributor Roly International Holdings' IPO in February was
14 per cent undersubscribed.

A dealer said the subscription rate could be poor because Easyknit's offer
period was too short. The offering, which was launched on Sept 27, closed on
Oct 1.

Dow breaches 6,000 for first time in early trading: "Overseas funds pour
into Hongkong bourse" and "Bourse fails torally on back of Wall Street
gains"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

NEW York stocks surged in early trading yesterday, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average breaking the 6,000-point barrier for the first time.

It reached a high of 6,002.17 within the first hour.

Meanwhile, Asian bourses closed mixed yesterday, following a strong rally on
Wall Street last Friday as fears of higher interest rates subsided.

A surprisingly weak US September jobs report, released last Friday, quelled
concerns of rising interest rates, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average up
60.01 points to a record close of 5,992.86.

The Hongkong stock market was one of the main beneficiaries of the Wall Street
gains.

The Hang Seng Index surged yesterday to record its biggest point gain since
March as new records on Wall Street and strong interest in China counters
spurred active buying.

The market barometer jumped 227.56 points to 12,133.07. It now lies just 68
points short of its record close of 12,201.09, which was reached on Jan 4,
1994.

Australian stocks also climbed, led by media group News Corp and banks, thanks
to Australian bond yields falling to 2-1/2-year lows and the rally in US
stocks.

The benchmark All-Ordinaries Index rose 24.3 points to 2,339.8, a shade below
its all-time closing high of 2,340.6 in February 1994.

Markets elsewhere in Asia, however, fell despite the sharp gains in New York.

In Singapore, poor sentiment coupled with sustained underweighting activity
led the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index to fall 22.2 points to
2,126.66.

Across the Causeway, the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index shed 1.68
points to 1148.50, while the Second Board index fell 12.27 points, or 2.1 per
cent, to 558.97.

Indonesian stocks also declined, dragged lower by a 6 per cent drop in
cigarette maker PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna on concerns about its US$400
million (S$564 million) borrowings.

The benchmark Jakarta Stock Composite Index slipped 2.03 points to 586.31.

Likewise in Manila, Philippine stocks sank as some foreign funds off-loaded
property counters on concern that the market was becoming saturated.

The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 10.11 points to
3,121.03.

Thai stocks were battered, plunging a sharp 6 per cent at the close of
trading.

Big banks led the decline amid concern that annual economic growth of 8 per
cent was a thing of the past, analysts said.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index finished down 60.26 points at 944.63.
This was its lowest level since August 1993.

Property buyers becoming highly price-sensitive : Analysts

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kalpana Rashiwala

Government curbs "effective in pushing speculators out of market'

PROPERTIES launched in recent weeks appear to have enjoyed reasonable success,
particularly those priced competitively, say analysts.

One of the most successful developments is Wing Tai's Sunrise Gardens off Yio
Chu Kang Road. The 99-year project, with 252 condominium units, is about 65
per cent sold three weeks after its launch in mid-September.

Analysts credited its success primarily to its attractive average net price of
$580 psf. Some market watchers had feared earlier that the project's 99-year
leasehold status and its location in an outlying area might impede sales.

One market watcher noted that in contrast, Villa Azura was less than half sold
although it was a freehold property in the prime Bukit Timah belt. Villa
Azura's net average price is $1,150 psf.

"Buyers have become extremely price-sensitive," said UBS Securities senior
research analyst Soon Ching Voon. "In the past, people were more willing to
pay whatever price was asked as long as the project was freehold and had a
good location. This is no longer true."

He said the May 15 property curbs had removed speculators from the market.
"These people did not care about pricing. As long as the location was good and
the project was freehold, they knew there would be buyers, so they could churn
the property. Now the market is left with genuine buyers who know what they
can afford to pay every month."

Other recent launches which have fared well include Pidemco's Hillbrooks
condominium, launched a week ago.

Eighty-four of the 120 units in the 299-unit project offered in the first
phase have been sold. The units are priced at $700 psf -lower than the
$730-750 psf for two earlier projects nearby, The Amston and Merawoods.

Ballota Park is also doing well, with 161 units of the 215 units launched
taken up already. Far East Organization's Sherwood, selling at $800 psf, is
about 75 per cent sold.

Edmund Tie and Co executive director Ong Choon Fah expects developers to
continue pricing their projects "realistically", in view of the "current
market sentiment".

About 1,600 private housing units have been launched since Sept 1, increasing
the total marketed so far this year to about 8,680 units, according to ET & Co
figures.

Mrs Ong said another 4,000 units may be launched before the year is out,
taking the fullyear figure to 12,680 -higher than about 10,000 units marketed
last year.

However, the level of actual supply would depend on a few factors, like
developers securing the necessary approvals to launch the projects, she said.

With most developers, particularly those with larger projects, seeking to sell
their properties in phases, there may be some overflow in the early part of
next year.

With showflats playing an increasingly important role in the marketing of
projects, developers may wait for their showflats to be completed before
launching their projects.

"And if by the time this is done, it is approaching the Christmas season with
many people away, developers may want to hold back the launch," she said.

Projects slated for launch include the 655-unit Guilin View at Bukit Batok,
the 384-unit Trellis Park at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and the final 110 units at
Ardmore Park.

On the pricing of upcoming launches, Mr Soon said: "Developers will still try
to maintain their original (pre-speculation curbs) asking prices or cut them
by about 10 per cent.

"So far we have not seen developers undercutting each other, although
Pidemco's $700 psf pricing for Hillbrooks raised concern among some
competitors.

"This is clearly a buyer's market. Buyers can afford to do their sums, to see
which projects they can afford ... and with more supply coming on, that's good
news for home buyers."

Doing the sums on Tampines Finance Park  - Will banks be sold on relocating
their operations?

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lynn Seah

The buildings are coming up fast at Singapore's first finance park in
Tampines. The biggest leaseholder, Singapore Land, will have its Tampines
Junction office ready next March, but so far, there have been no takers. LYNN
SEAH checks out the prospects for the finance park, on Page Two.

DOING THE SUMS ON TAMPINES FINANCE PARK

IT IS lunch hour. Briefcase-toting executive types cram the eating places. It
looks like Raffles Place, but wait, why are there so many grandmothers with
toddlers in tow, and children in school uniforms?

But then this is a vision not of Raffles Place, but of Tampines in the future,
when its Finance Park is fully developed.

The park, which was mooted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the
Economic Development Board, is to be a key financial centre outside the
Central Business District. The Government wants to encourage banks and
finance-related businesses to re-locate backroom operations there.

Six parcels of land totalling 1.94 ha in Tampines Regional Centre have been
tendered out by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in 1994 and last year
for the development of the park. One condition was that developers must house
finance-related operations on at least 70 per cent of the floor space.

Singapore Land's Tampines Junction will be one of the first developments to be
completed next March. The company is negotiating with some financial
institutions, but no tenants have been confirmed yet for the nine-storey
building.

Besides SingLand, which clinched three of the six plots through wholly-owned
Shenton Holdings, the other successful bidders were Tat Lee Bank, Overseas
Union Bank and NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative.

They will not be the first to bring financial institutions into Tampines,
however.

DBS Bank moved some operations to Tampines as far back as 1993. Its
autobanking centre, data centre, as well as administration, audit, human
resource and training functions are now housed in DBS Tampines Centre, an
office and shopping complex.

Standard Chartered has also moved some of its operations, now housed in the
CPF Tampines building.

However, Tampines Junction and the other SingLand developments are unique in
that they will not be owner-occupied. The developers of the other plots are
all finance-related businesses.

To fill the approximately 15,000 sq m of net floor space in Tampines Junction,
SingLand is targeting multinational financial institutions which are heavy
users of space, but do not need much face-to-face interaction with customers.

"We are looking especially at those involved in international and regional
trade financing because most of the transactions are done through computers,"
said Mr Anthony Sim, SingLand's general manager for marketing.

To the smaller users of space who will reap less in terms of rental savings,
SingLand is trying to sell another idea -that of the benefits of having a full
back-up service in a different place.

"There is a trend now for banks to have a back-up office somewhere else, just
in case the computer in the main branch fails to deliver," he said.

So Tampines Junction offers features such as a back-up generator with enough
capacity to power the air-conditioning and computers in the building if there
is a power failure.

In its marketing efforts, SingLand is trying to encourage its potential
tenants to take a long view when deciding whether to re-locate.

"The selling point is actually mid-term savings. For multinatinal banks, who
occupy a number of floors, the saving over five to 10 years is substantial,"
said Mr Sim.

Monetary savings aside, companies have other concerns about moving, in
particular staff resistance.

LAST year, a survey by property consultant Knight Frank and a former National
University of Singapore academic showed that only 3.8 per cent of 158
respondents located in the CBD said they would move out in the immediate
future. Respondents included financial institutions. Of those considering
decentralising, about 60 per cent said they preferred fringe areas such as
Marina Bay.

Concerns about decentralisation centred on the fear of damage to business
contacts due to "inappropriate location" and loss of the prestige attached to
central addresses.

Apart from Tampines Junction, Singland has two eight-storey office buildings,
Tampines Plaza I & II, to be completed in 1998.

Tat Lee Bank's eight-storey TLB Tampines Centre will be completed in mid-1997,
but will be fully owner-occupied. Tat Lee will house backroom operations,
recreational facilites for staff and a banking branch.

NTUC Income plans to use 30 per cent of the space in its nine-storey Tampines
Point for its own operations.

The other leaseholder, OUB, declined to reveal its plans.

Whether or not more sites in Tampines Regional Centre will be offered for
finance-park development has not been decided, says the HDB.

Keppel Bank is actively exploring the possibility of moving to the suburbs,
but the cost has to be right, says a spokesman.

The success of Tampines Finance Park will hinge on rents being attractive
enough. "Rental differentials have to be substantial to make it worthwhile for
a company to locate there," said Ms Angela Tan, executive director with
property consultant Edmund Tie & Company.

Top office rents in the CBD are $9 to $10 per sq ft. Suburban rents are $4 to
$6. SingLand's asking rental is about $6.

SingLand explains that its rentals are high for suburban properties because
the offices are as good as those in the CBD. The cost of Tampines Junction,
including land cost, is more than $100 million.

There is market talk that the developer may think of selling instead of
renting but Life! could not get a comment from SingLand by press time. One
property consultant felt the asking rent was unrealistic. "This is a new
market. You cannot ask what you want. You have to sell the idea," he said.

Consultants also point out that there are ample alternative locations for
financial institutions if rentals in Tampines are unattractive.

There is the fringe, the Marina Bay area where rents of $6.50 to $7.50 per sq
ft compare favourably with those of the suburbs. The upcoming developments in
River Valley -Great World City, UE Square, Valley Point -will also be
competing with Tampines for tenants.

Property consultants generally feel that for the Finance Park to take off, the
gap between the rents there and those in the fringe locations will have to be
widened.

"Perhaps the Government can offer some kind of incentive, like rental
subsidies, to help the landlords attract tenants," said Ms Lynette Leong,
associate director at Jones Lang Wootton.

BUT there is no question that the concept of a finance park is a good one
which banks can benefit from.

Mr Christopher Fossick, Richard Ellis' executive director for commercial
leasing, said: "I think what is going to happen is that a few significant
leases will be concluded, a critical mass will start forming and the idea of
going to Tampines will become more acceptable to banks and their employees."

The pool of potential tenants for the park is also growing as more and more
foreign banks are using Singapore as a base, he adds.

Besides, Tampines has a lot going for it -good transport and a good range of
eating, shopping, entertainment and other service outlets. These count towards
making re-location less painful for staff.

Tampines is being built up as Singapore's eastern hub with facilities such as
offices and shopping complexes which will offer a range of jobs. There are
plans to boost the commercial space at Tampines Regional Centre around the
Tampines MRT Station, now amounting to about 243,000 sq m, by another 79,000
sq m. Some 176,800 people live in Tampines now.

When DBS Bank made its move three years ago, the matter of some staff having
to travel further from home to office was anticipated. It was resolved by
tranferring those who did not mind working in Tampines to the new offices and
redeploying the rest elsewhere. People living around Tampines were also
recruited for the new offices.

Has the move been worthwhile? "The savings in rental far exceeds any
additional expenses," said a spokesman.

Will enough financial institutions feel the same way? There will be quite a
bit of space coming up in the park.

Two men, their friendship and passion for science: Computer science and
biology make good bedfellows

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lea Wee

Childhood buddies Tan Tin Wee and S. Subbiah learnt the importance of science
in school and have now joined forces to run the new Bioinformatics Centre here

TWO old friends are charting new courses in the use of computer science in
biological research and the development of drugs here.

Dr Tan Tin Wee and Dr S. Subbiah -classmates since Primary 2 -played key roles
in setting up the Bioinformatics Centre at the National University of
Singapore, one of the few such centres in the world.

The two are naturally excited about their project, which held its inaugural
symposium last week.

The centre plans to help biologists and drug companies analyse and manage the
huge amount of genetic data which has been churned out at a fantastic rate in
recent years.

Its development grew out of a friendship bound in great part by a deep passion
for science.

Says Dr Tan, 34, the centre's acting director: "One of the things we learnt in
school is the importance of being creative in science, and not to be afraid to
try out new things."

Try out new things they certainly did.

In a science project at Anglo-Chinese Junior College, they joined forces with
two other students to show that human hair can be turned into food products.

Chuckling, Dr Subbiah, 35, the centre's director for research, recalls: "We
went to barber shops, told them we were doing some science project and grabbed
the hair off the floor."

The collected hair was then boiled and stewed for two days in "various nasty
chemicals".

Says Dr Subbiah: "We did not understand exactly how the whole thing worked.
All we knew was that we wanted to boil the strands of hair into its basic
building blocks, which are amino acids."

They showed that boiled hair can be used as plastic, glue, plant fertilisers
and animal feed.

The project, called The Possible Uses And Applications Of Human Hair Keratin,
won them first prize in the pre-university chemistry section for the Science
Fair Project in 1978.

They also produced a science documentary, which won the Best Production award
in the Innovators '79 TV series.

"We had a great time catching on camera how animals such as pigs, chickens and
sea urchins do it," recalls Dr Subbiah with a grin.

After junior college, the two friends went off down separate paths. Dr Tan
served his national service and later read natural sciences at Cambridge
University.

Dr Subbiah went to do mathematical physics in the Imperial College of London.

But they kept in touch and did not forget what they were taught in school.

Dr Subbiah, after deciding that the job opportunities for a degree in
mathematical physics were "not too great", went on to pursue a doctorate in
structural biology at Harvard University.

"But I hated it," he says, grimacing at the memory.

He decided to try something more theoretical and took a postdoctoral degree in
biocomputing at Stanford University.

It was the right decision. He went on to file a few patents and co-founded a
biotechnology software company in the United States.

Today, he does research at Wistar Institute at the University of Pennsylvania,
one of the foremost centres for bioinformatics.

Meanwhile, after getting his degree, Dr Tan went on a masters degree in
biotechnology at University College London and later a doctorate at Edinburgh
University.

As part of his doctorate, he produced a genetically-engineered animal vaccine,
which won the young researcher the United Kingdom's Vaccine Research Trust's
Annual Prize in 1989.

A year later, he returned to join the National University of Singapore's
biochemistry department as a lecturer. Outside his working hours, he continued
to pursue his interest in biocomputing with the help of the Computer Centre at
the NUS.

Dr Tan was also instrumental in introducing biocomputing as an elective for
biochemistry honours course in 1991.

His work in Internet biomedical databases won him the prestigious Gold Medal
awarded by the Council of the World Congress for Medical Informatics in 1992
and the Singapore Youth Award in 1994.

In 1994, he donned another hat, heading the Technet unit, the first local
Internet service for research and development and took it to privatisation in
1995.

This later became the Pacific Internet.

As early as 1991, Dr Tan and Dr Subbiah were already talking about introducing
bioinformatics in Singapore.

With the encouragement of the latter, Dr Tan proposed to incorporate
biocomputing as part of the Bioscience Centre. But this was dropped because of
budget constraints. Says Dr Tan: "At that time, we commiserated with each
other but continued to float the idea to various funding bodies."

One of these was the Economic Development Board.

Their persistence paid off. Last year, the EDB agreed to pump $6 million to
set up of a Bioinformatics Centre at the NUS.

Says Dr Subbiah: "It is really exciting to be working in such a field, the
opportunities are tremendous."

Both credit their success today to their teachers at Anglo-Chinese Secondary
and ACJC.

Says Dr Tan: "I remembered that before I left ACS, my principal wrote in my
testimonial that I would succeed in whatever I chose to do. His confidence in
students was shared by the teachers.

"This confidence has become a virtuous cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy."

Computer science and biology make good bedfellows: Two men, their
friendship and passion for science

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

IT MAY seem ironic that many of the staff at the newly-opened Bioinformatics
Centre at the National University of Singapore are not trained specifically in
bioinformatics.

Instead, they are either biologists who have picked up computer science or
computer scientists who have learnt biology.

For bioinformatics, which marries biology with computer science, is still a
relatively new discipline, explains the centre's acting director, Dr Tan Tin
Wee.

But it is beginning to be recognised slowly as a discipline in universities
around the world. In Singapore, it was introduced as an elective for
biochemistry honours students at the National University of Singapore in 1991.

Says Dr Tan: "There is an increasing demand for people who are adept at both
computer science and biology."

This is largely because of the explosive growth of genetic data generated by
the Human Genome Project which began in 1991.

The ultimate aim of this global collaboration is to identify and analyse all
the three billion "letters" in a person's genetic make-up -known collectively
as the human genome -by the year 2002.

Biomedical researchers hope the analysed data can identify new genes which may
help in curing genetic diseases. Meanwhile, drug companies hope this
information can help them discover and develop new drugs.

But the biological information is being generated at a far faster rate than it
can be analysed.

Dr Tan points out, for instance, that the process of identifying DNA
sequencing has reached an industrial scale today -about 10 million DNA
sequences are being churned out each week.

Flooded with this huge amount of genetic data, biologists and drug companies
alike are clamouring for people trained in both biology and computer science
to help them retrieve and analyse the data.

The resource unit at the Bioinformatics Centre, located at the NUS Computer
Centre, hopes to create a manpower pool to provide training. It also hopes to
provide facilities to assist biologists with their computational needs and
provide access to databases.

Equally important is the need to carry out more basic research and
development, says Dr Tan.

The centre has a research unit located at the Institute of Systems Science.

Its flagship project, spearheaded by the ISS and in collaboration with the
University of Pennsylvania, one of the foremost centres for bioinformatics, is
BioKleisli.

This is a sophisticated system which pulls relevant information from various
databases, integrates, crunches and analyses them, before giving them back to
the user

Heading the project team is its inventor, Dr Wong Lim Soon, from the ISS, a
Lee Kuan Yew Fellowship holder.

Says Dr Tan: "At present, the other available tools are not so sophisticated
and fast. They can pull information only from specific databases."

To maintain the integrity of the information, the system will build another
layer to help resolve any conflicts found within it.

Right now, the centre is negotiating with at least two pharmaceutical giants
to test the system on their network and to collaborate on projects. It is also
conducting the virtual cell project. It represents biological knowledge in a
virtual reality manner.

Says Dr Tan: "At the click of a button, a person can navigate through a cell
and access information on the part of the cell he is interested in. He can
also get related information and communicate with people who are doing
research in this particular part of the cell."

This project will eventually merge with the BioKleisli Project.

Two art auctions rake in $10 m and record prices

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Claudette Peralta

ART lovers and investors apparently worked up quite a thirst pouring money
into paintings from South-east Asia over the weekend.

One bidder also uncorked $38,500 from his bank account for a lot of wines.

The world's two major auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's, raked in
combined sales of nearly $10 million. More than 800 people attended the
events.

By far the biggest chunk of money went for a piece by the German painter who
lived and worked in Bali, Walter Spies. His View Across the Sawahs To Gunung
Agung alone fetched $1,048,750.

That was more than twice the original estimate of between $500,000 and
$700,000. It was sold on Sunday at the Christie's auction at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel which grossed a total of about $5.5 million in sales.

Other paintings fetched prices three to six times higher than their estimates.

These included A Pasar by Singaporean artist Lee Man Fong which went for
$146,750 against the original estimate of $25,000 to $35,000.

Filipino artist Fernando Cueto Amorsolo's In the Shade Of A Mango Tree sold
for $119,250, well above the original estimate of $20,000 to $30,000.

Kampong Tafereeltje by the Dutch painter Gerard Pieter Adolfs was estimated to
be worth $6,000 to $8,000 but sold for $19,550.

Sotheby's debut sale in Singapore grossed a total of S$3,803,350. It sold
almost 80 per cent of the lots offered.

A painting by A.J. Le Mayeur, Three Women Weaving in the Garden, fetched
$333,750 against the original estimate of between $120,000 and $150,000.

The Sotheby's auction, held at the Raffles Hotel Ballroom on Saturday, also
saw a few world auction record prices for works by some artists. One of them
was Hendra Gunawan, whose Women At A Waterfall was sold for $245,750.

Other records were chalked up by Emil Rizek and Widayat. Rizek's Cockfight In
Bali was sold for $141,250, while the latter's Manula Jogging Dikejar Anjing
went for $93,950.

The lots which did not meet the organiser's expectations was a work by
Singaporean artist Liu Kang titled Offerings and the work of Filipino artist
Juan Luna. These were not sold.

The sales included takings from the auction of South-east Asian paintings,
Straits Chinese works of art and the auction of fine and rare wines.

One happy bidder walked off with a Chateau Le Pin superlot of wines selected
from the 1985, 1986 and 1988 to 1994 vintages. These were sold collectively
for $38,500.

Another highlight was the sale of a very rare famille rose coral-red-ground
"in and out" Kamcheng and cover, originally priced at $18,000 to $25,000,
which sold for $27,600.

Mr Quek Chin Yeow, director of Sotheby's, Asia, noted that Singaporean,
Filipino and Vietnamese artists generally performed well.

But Indonesian art, both by native and foreign artists, were the star
performers and paintings with Balinese themes or subject matter found wide
appeal among buyers.

Ovarian cancer girl may miss umrah

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Tuminah Sapawi

OVARIAN cancer patient Nur Atiiqah Johari, who is due to perform the umrah
(minor pilgrimage) this month, may have to forgo the trip because of her
deteriorating condition.

The nine-year-old girl's doctor, Dr Allen Yeoh, a child cancer specialist at
the National University Hospital (NUH), told Life! that her condition is not
stable and she is unfit to travel.

"She is in great pain and right now, what is good for her is rest -she needs
all the rest she can get," said Dr Yeoh, who declined to reveal more about her
condition.

Nur Atiiqah was hospitalised about two weeks ago at NUH and is still being
treated there.

On learning of her condition, Syakira Travel & Tours, which is sponsoring her
trip, has decided to offer a cash donation of $4,600 instead. This is the cost
of a 12-day umrah package for two adults and one child.

Late last month, the travel agent had agreed to sponsor Nur Atiiqah's parents
for the trip as well.

Said Syakira's managing director Ismail Angullia: "There were two things which
we considered when we heard of her present condition. We could either postpone
the trip until she gets better or we could give her cash instead.

"We chose the latter because we think the family needs all the financial
assistance they could get."

Nur Atiiqah's parents, Mr Johari Simum, 48, and Madam Sariah Samuh, 40, were
too distraught to speak to the press.

Mr Johari is a Malaysian who works there, and he visits the family from time
to time. Madam Sariah is a production operator.

Nur Atiiqah is the third of their five children. The others are Siti Sholeha,
14, Mohamed Hasbullah, 10, Ibrahim Abdul Karim, six, and Mohamed Adam, four.

The girl, who was diagnosed with cancer in March this year, has had both her
ovaries removed and undergone chemotherapy.

Ovarian cancer is more common among older women although the chances of a
young girl getting it are one in 100,000 a year.

Nur Atiiqah stopped attending school when she began chemotherapy treatment in
the middle of this year. Her weight has also dropped from 35 kg to 25 kg.

In an earlier interview with the Malay-language daily Berita Harian, Madam
Sariah said her daughter can walk but is very weak.

Day when two Japanese bombs fell

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Wong Chee Meng

SPEAK MANDARIN CAMPAIGN 

THE reason Mr Teong Ah Chin remains a member of the Singapore Civil Defence
Force even at the age of 80 lies in his personal experiences during the
Japanese Occupation of Singapore.

The sprightly restaurant helper was then a patriotic young man selling flowers
in the streets to raise funds for China's anti-Japanese resistance forces.

One day, he was in the vicinity of the now-defunct New World at Jalan Besar
when a Japanese bomber swooped past him suddenly and dropped two bombs as he
ran for cover.

"One of them landed where Sim Lim Tower stands today, and the other at Jalan
Pisang where the coffeeshop belonging to my brother's father-in-law was," he
recalled.

"When I reached there, the coffeeshop was already reduced to rubble. I had to
remove the debris to rescue my brother."

Mr Teong recounted this experience at a Mandarin storytelling competition,
titled An Experience In Emergency, last Sunday.

The contest, organised by the Civil Defence Association for NS (CDANS), Lianhe
Wanbao, Shin Min Daily News and 95.8 FM as part of the current Speak Mandarin
Campaign, was held at the CDANS Town Clubhouse in Marina Square.

It attracted 35 participants, ranging in age from 15 to 80. About four of them
related historical happenings, including the times when floods and racial
riots gripped Singapore, while others told of personal tragedies resulting
from traffic accidents or factory mishaps.

Businessman Tan Jack Kwang, 37, remembered one weekend in 1978 when torrential
rains caused one of the worst floods on the island.

"The roads in Punggol and Potong Pasir disappeared under a sea of water.
Chickens, ducks, cows, dogs and even crocodiles were seen floating
everywhere."

He was then a national servicemen and, together with his colleagues, they took
out boats to rescue the stranded residents.

Painting sub-contractor Ho Kim Sian, 49, remembered the racial riots in 1964.

For hours, he could not leave his workplace because of the curfew.

Finally, on his way home, he saw a Chinese couple pleading in vain with
rioters not to burn their motorcycle.

"During the racial riots, tension ran high. I could feel every minute and
second ticking away," he said. "It just doesn't make sense for people to use
violence on each other."

Equally instructive were the personal tales.

System analyst Au Yong Keok, 35, shared a tragic incident close to her heart.

"My cousin's 30th death anniversary was just a few days ago, and I still
cannot forgive myself for having caused his death.

"I was five or six then and my cousin was nine years older. He had made me a
kite, and we were flying it when the string snapped and the kite flew to the
road. I bawled so loudly that he was forced to retrieve it for me.

"The next thing I knew, he was hit by a car. When I ran to the road, I saw a
pool of blood. The next day, I heard he had died. I cried."

Like Mr Ho, Mr Tan and most other participants, Ms Au Yong was
Chinese-educated and had taken part in several storytelling contests.

Mr Teong, too, was not a newcomer to such competitions, but he did not have a
formal Chinese education and learnt to speak Mandarin when he was in his 20s.

"I am a Fuzhou and I learnt Mandarin in a night school when I was 23," he
said. "I decided to pick up the language because it was fashionable to
converse in Mandarin then. Besides, we had to sing in Mandarin as part of our
fund-raising activities."

Generally, the contestants spoke in simple Mandarin, peppering their delivery
with an idiom every now and then.

Twelve were chosen for the finals to be held at the World Trade Centre Expo
Gateway on Oct 20.

The top three winners will take home $500, $400 and $300 respectively. The
fourth and fifth winners will receive $200 each and the rest $100 each. In
addition, all finalists will receive a trophy.

Sheer joy with Bartok showpiece

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Terence Dawson

Music

SINGAPORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Victoria Concert Hall Friday

THERE are three ways of responding to adversity: one can succumb to it, one
can defy it, or one can seize it as an opportunity to discover new things
about oneself.

Shaken by ill-health and the outbreak of World War II, Bartok had emigrated to
the United States. He was suffering from deep depression when the conductor
Koussevitsky commissioned him to write a work for the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.

The result was the Concerto For Orchestra, possibly the most accessible of his
works because it gives such important parts to every section of the orchestra.

It is often admired as a showpiece, but it is much more, representing one of
the most impressive responses to adversity ever written: the transformation of
personality not into self-indulgent expressionism, but joyful affirmation.

On Friday, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra under Choo Hoey gave it a
memorable reading. Having performed it on the European tour in 1988, and again
in 1991, it is a work it knows well. But since then, the orchestra has greatly
improved.

From the first shimmering of the violins against the steady cellos, every
section rose to its respective challenge, with the strings milking the music
for all its Hungarian resonance and the glowing brass in particularly fine
form.

The whimsical East-European cartoon-humour of the second movement was
complemented by a moving account of the scrupulously understated Elegy. The
ebullient humour of the Intermezzo was followed by a thrilling performance of
the alternately tender and joyful Finale.

The performance of Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, for which Choo Hoey opted
for a medium-sized orchestra, was equally impressive. The soloist was Kun Woo
Paik, a Korean now living in Paris. He is one of those relatively rare
pianists prepared to take risks, to experiment with possibilities rather than
reproduce what the audience have come to hear.

From the electrifying energy of his first entry to his gnomic cadenza, he kept
one transfixed. Instead of the usual hymn-like melody of the Adagio, he
emphasised the pathos of its insecure yearning: unstable and tender, but not
cloying. The last dying strain before the final chords was pure magic.

The evening also included the Overture to Schumann's rarely-performed opera
Genoveva. The SSO gave a splendid account of the tumultuous passions of the
three characters on which it was based, with the work building up to a
magnificent climax.

Souls in containers teem with secret lives

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Art

DORRIT YACOBY: VESSELS OF THE SOUL By Dorrit Yacoby At Notices The Gallery
Till Oct 26

ONE is introduced to art that lies on the edge between conscious sanity and
unconscious dreams in Dorrit Yacoby's works.

The 70-plus assemblages, which are the accumulated debris of her life, are
wrought with images of long-limbed women flying or raising their arms in
salute or despair, or in an embrace of the vessel.

Here, the vessel is one's heart, the container that may be filled with
purifying water for one's rebirth.

The theme of despair and rejuvenation is inherent in this series of works
which is, for the Israeli-Canadian, who has lived all her life in Israel, a
slow process that embodies her own rejuvenation.

"When I do the paintings, I heal myself," explains the 44-year-old whose works
were exhibited earlier this year in Beijing, Japan and Bangkok, and will
continue its tour from Singapore to India, Vietnam and Australia.

Each work lies in a roughly-made "container" itself. Within it, the works teem
with life through the heavily pock-marked and textured surfaces, created from
sawdust and objects such as shards of glass or porcelain, pomegranates, or
something as personal as her son's shoelace or a rope belonging to her
daughter.

The objects, culled into the space within the frame, carry within them a
secret life.

As artist Kandinsky once wrote: "Everything that is dead quivers. Not only the
things of poetry, stars, moon, wood, flowers, but even a white trouser button
glittering out of a puddle in the street ... Everything has a secret soul,
which is silent more often than it speaks."

The superimposed images of stars, ribbons, candles, vessels and women lend to
the coherence of that life; the works metamorphosise even as they hang there,
drowned in and besieged by the tar that Yacoby has poured into the container.

This struggle between the tar and the objects for "life" matches Yacoby's
constant discovery and confirmation of symbolic meanings.

Having studied Jewish mysticism, she has been surprised at how her
self-created tales parallel folk-myths. For instance, the flying woman she
depicts in The Flying Woman and Golden Tree With Flying Souls, is symbolic of
freedom. In mythology or folklore, a woman who had been fed with stones still
has the ability to "fly".

Overall, this exhibition is about the artist who, despite living in near
isolation, surrounded by the desert on three sides and a neighbourhood street
on the other, has the ability to "fly".

Yet the profundity of her work speaks not only of the individual but also of
the universal as it resonates within those of us who dare to look on when
someone peels back the layer that covers the soul.

Jackson"s concert aims to make HIStory here: "Tickets selling well" and
"Selangor bans concert by Michael Jackson"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Rebecca Lim

With the logistics, nine shows can be put up in Singapore Indoor Stadium, says
production manager

THE Michael Jackson HIStory show, to be held at the National Stadium two weeks
from now, promises to make history here as the biggest pop concert ever.

It would be even bigger than the two staged by the self-proclaimed King of Pop
when he was here three years ago on his Dangerous tour, says Mr Peter Loh,
production manager for the HIStory concerts in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

Those previous concerts were, by far, the largest among pop concerts to have
been staged here, says Mr Loh, who also worked on them. But the current show
looks set to dwarf them.

"With the logistics for the HIStory concert, you can put up nine shows in the
Singapore Indoor Stadium," he adds. For example, five generators are being
shipped in to churn up 8,400 amperes of electricity needed to power the
one-night show.

"The last time, the power generated was comparable to what was needed to light
up Ang Mo Kio," he says. "This time, we are using one more generator -enough
to light up another row of houses next to Ang Mo Kio."

Some 500 tonnes of equipment and props, including 160 tonnes of steel for the
structure of the stage, will be shipped and flown here.

It seems Jackson will cart in his own kitchen and air-conditioners to be put
on stage to cool him down as he goes about his sizzling dance numbers.

Over here, Mr Loh has to look for a host of equipment and material, including
toilets, about 12,000 chairs and 36,000 sq ft of plywood.

It will take almost a week to prepare for the concert, he adds.

Work will begin on the Sunday before the concert on Oct 25, and a crane will
have to be moved into the stadium for the process.

Mr Loh will be helped by 800 crew members, who will be working 10 hours each
over that period of time.

On the day of the concert, 170 security men, 170 ticket collectors and 160
ushers will be employed to ensure that things run smoothly when the expected
crowd of 36,000 turns up.

As a result of all the effort and the staggering logistics, the audience can
expect to see a lot of visual effects using video, virtual reality, lights and
spectacular pyrotechnics, says Lushington Entertainments director Michael
Roche, who watched the MJ concerts in Amsterdam last week.

His company is promoting the HIStory concerts here and in Kuala Lumpur.

"The consensus among those who saw it is that it is a much slicker show with a
lot more drama," he says.

"He only broke down to cry once," he adds.

He observes that Jackson seemed "much more at ease" and was "having fun and
enjoying himself on stage".

Without revealing too much that will spoil the surprises, he says fans should
watch the guitarist closely and look out for some surprises when Jackson
performs Beat It.

He adds that there will also be a 60-minute countdown before the start of the
concert. Fans can look forward to fancy footwork from Jackson and his eight
dancers.

One can also expect some splitting images with the use of a big screen that
has a tracking system, called the Jumbotron, adds Mr Loh, who also went to the
concerts in Amsterdam.

"There is a lot of work which goes into ensuring that the images are aligned
perfectly," he says.

The opening sequence, which has been described in reviews on the Internet,
uses a virtual reality film footage and has MJ bursting onto stage amidst much
pomp and pageantry in a gold spacesuit.

Says Mr Roche: "I have been following concerts since I was eight or nine years
old, and I still think there is something about Michael Jackson. His stage
presence is unbelievable."

Tickets selling well: Jackson"s concert aims to make HIStory here

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

ABOUT 4,300 tickets priced at $200 for the Michael Jackson HIStory concert
have been sold out.

Certainly, Jacko's much-maligned reputation, with the reports of sex abuse of
children, has not had an effect on ticket sales.

Concert promoters Lushington Entertainments say only limited tickets are
available from the Overseas Union Bank, which has priority booking for its
card members.

The majority of the $200 tickets for seats in front of the stage went on sale
to the public on Sept 27. Those were sold out in two days.

Tickets priced at $125, which are for seats in the sheltered grandstand are
also "moving fast". Also popular are the $55 tickets for the free-seating
section in the gallery.

Show promoters say tickets are also selling well to Jackson fans from the
region. One fan flew here from Indonesia to buy 100 tickets for friends and
family members.

Tickets at $55, $125 and $160 are available from Sistic outlets. OUB card
members are encouraged to call the Sistic hotline on 348-5555 soon for
preferred seats.

PRESIDENT ERNESTO ZEDILLO ANNOUNCES
CONTROVERSIAL CABINET CHANGES

    On Dec. 29, President Ernesto Zedillo announced the fifth
cabinet reshuffle of his short tenure in office.  Among the
changes is a controversial decision to appoint Arsenio Farell
Cubillas--a close ally of former president Carlos Salinas de
Gortari--to head the comptroller's office (Secretaria de la
Controlaria Nacional de la Federacion y Administracion,
Secodam).
    Farell replaced Norma Samaniego, who was in the midst of
an investigation into the financial affairs of Raul Salinas de
Gortari, the brother of ex-president Salinas.  Raul Salinas is
accused of using high-level positions in government to
illegally amass US$100 million in secret bank accounts in
Switzerland and other countries in Europe and the Americas.
Some of the allegations also tie Raul Salinas to prominent
Mexican narcotraffickers (see SourceMex, 12/06/95).
     The new charges of corruption against Raul Salinas come
on top of previous allegations that the former president's
brother masterminded the assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, a high-level official of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in October 1994.  In fact, Raul
Salinas was already in federal custody, awaiting trial in the
Ruiz Massieu case when the new charges brought by Secodam and
the Attorney General's Office (PGR) were announced.
     However, Farell's appointment to replace Samaniego has
created strong skepticism that the full extent of corruption
alleged against Raul Salinas and other members of the family,
including the former president himself, will ever be known.
     As expected, Farell's appointment to head Secodam
attracted immediate protests from members of opposition
parties and independent legislators in the Chamber of
Deputies.
     "Now, with Farell, it is going to be practically
impossible for us to get the information," said Deputy Adolfo
Aguilar Zinser, an independent legislator.  "It is clear that
we will face extraordinary obstacles to carry out the
investigation."
     This charge was echoed by Juan Guerra, a deputy for the
opposition Democratic Revolution Party (PRD).
     "I think Farell is being moved into the comptroller's
office to cover up the tracks of the ex-president and his
brother in the illicit enrichment scandal," said Guerra.
     Farell served as labor secretary and as head of the
controversial government security commission under Salinas,
and he remains very close to the president.
     Some political commentators suggested that Farell was
chosen for the post to heal a split between Salinas and
Zedillo and within the PRI itself.  A major source of the
conflict has been Zedillo's willingness to publicly blame ex-
president Salinas for the devaluation of the peso in December
1994.
     Farell is said to have played a key role in trying to
sooth a public dispute between Salinas and Zedillo early in
1995, hosting a dinner for the two after Salinas ended a brief
hunger strike in March.
     Salinas has not only expressed strong resentment against
Zedillo for linking him directly to the peso devaluation, but
is also said to be very angry at the President for approving
the arrest of his brother Raul in the Ruiz Massieu case.
     Indeed, some political columnists suggest that as part of
the truce between the current and former president, Zedillo
agreed to back down on his vigorous investigation of the
Salinas family.
     "Raul Salinas has heard in prison that his family has
received guarantees of no further persecution," said columnist
Jose Urena in the daily newspaper La Jornada.  Urena, however,
gave no further details of the alleged guarantees.
     Some political columnists suggest that Farell's
appointment to Secodam, while easing tensions within the PRI,
will also further erode Zedillo's credibility.
     "This is a monumental error," said prominent columnist
Miguel Angel Granados Chapa.  "Apart from signifying a
revalidation of the Salinas system, there seems to be no logic
in his appointment."
     Despite all the criticisms, the Zedillo administration
attempted to cast a positive light on Farell's appointment.
     "The new head of Secodam, with his ample knowledge of the
law and ample government experience, will expedite the
modernization of the federal government and take stronger and
more efficient action toward preventing and combating
corruption," the administration said in a prepared statement.
     The controversy over Farell's nomination as head of
Secodam appeared to overshadow Zedillo's appointment of
economist Jesus Reyes Heroles to head the Energy Secretariat
(SE), replacing Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza.  Unlike the Farell
case, this appointment was met with very little opposition,
and in fact was applauded by opposition legislators because of
Pichardo's departure from office.
     Pichardo, who was considered a member of the so-called
"dinosaurs" or "old guard" of the PRI, will be reassigned to
a yet-to-be-determined diplomatic post.
     Reyes Heroles, who leaves his post as director of the
national public works bank (Banco Nacional de Obras Publicas,
BANOBRAS), obtained a degree in economics from the
Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT).  According to an
official statement, Reyes will "oversee the expansion and
modernization of Mexico's energy sector."  Among other things,
Reyes will play a key role in the privatization of the
country's petrochemical plants, which are currently operated
by the state-run oil company PEMEX.
     Among other minor changes announced by Zedillo in the
December cabinet reshuffle was the appointment of Carlos
Almada Lopez as his chief government spokesperson, replacing
Carlos Salomon Camara.  This was partly seen as a move by the
president to spruce up his image.  Salomon was widely
criticized for rocky relations with the Mexican news media.
Meantime, Samaniego, who left the post as head of Secodam, was
named as a special adviser to Zedillo.
     With the changes announced in late December, Zedillo has
replaced almost one-half of his original cabinet.  The most
prominent departure was Jaime Serra Puche as finance
secretary, who received a large share of the blame for the
devaluation of the peso (see SourceMex, 02/08/95).
     Another major departure last year was that of Zedillo's
close ally Esteban Moctezuma, who left the post of interior
secretary in mid-1995.  According to political analysts,
Moctezuma had proven ineffective in dealing with a number of
crisis situations affecting the government, such as the lack
of progress on talks with the Zapatista National Liberation
Army (EZLN) in Chiapas and the failed efforts to reach
agreement with the two largest opposition parties on political
reforms.
     The resignation in mid-1995 of then-public education
secretary Fausto Alzati also proved to be a major
embarrassment to the Zedillo administration.  Alzati was
forced to leave his post after admitting he lied about his
educational background.  The departures of Moctezuma and
Alzati were announced in July of last year (see SourceMex,
07/05/95).
     Political analysts suggest that the latest cabinet
changes announced in December are expected to greatly benefit
Interior (Gobernacion) Secretary Emilio Chuayffet Chemor, who
is close to many of the appointees.
     "Chuayffet must be smiling from ear to ear," said Reforma
columnist F. Bartolome.  "His team and influence are expanding
in the midst of the current administration."
     Indeed, Zedillo's new spokesperson, Carlos Almada, is a
close ally of Chuayffet.  Almada left a high-level post in the
Interior Secretariat (Secretaria de Gobernacion, SG) to take
over his new post.  (Sources: Agence France-Presse, 12/30/95;

ZEDILLO'S FIRST YEAR: PRESIDENT,
OR PRISONER OF CRISIS? (Part 1)

                 By John Ross
[The author is a freelance journalist who has written on
Mexican political and economic affairs for many years.]

     When outgoing president Carlos Salinas affixed the sash
with the colors of the Mexican flag--red, white, and green--
across Ernesto Zedillo's chest on Dec. 1, 1994, Mexico
appeared to be on the rebound after a nightmare year of Indian
rebellion and political assassination.  The new president
inherited an economy that appeared to hold great promise for
Mexico due to the enactment of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).  Additionally, his long-ruling (66 years)
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) managed to win with
50% of the votes in national elections in August 1994.
     However, less than three weeks after his installation,
massive capital flight and the time bomb of short-term debt
obligations left behind by Salinas, forced Zedillo to devalue
the peso, triggering a chain reaction that quickly plunged
Mexico into an economic and social crisis which has colored
every minute of the new president's first year in office.
     Since the so-called "December errors," Zedillo has
staggered from one crisis to the next, like a shipwrecked
soul, overwhelmed by the flood of events.  In February, as the
economy crashed in flames, Zedillo bowed to the military and
ordered a full-scale offensive into the Lacandon Jungle base
of the popular Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN),
setting off a worldwide tide of protest.
     At the end of February, as public disdain for Salinas
began to soar, Zedillo gave the green light to arrest the
former president's brother for masterminding the murder of the
PRI's secretary-general, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
     For his part, Salinas took umbrage, declared a hunger
strike, and flew off into self-exile in Canada, from where he
has unremittingly sniped at Zedillo's fumbling administration
ever since.
     Meanwhile, the PRI was losing state elections to the
center-right National Action Party (PAN) by lopsided margins
and the bottom continued to fall out of the economy.  Indeed,
a drop of 10.5% in the GDP during the second quarter was a
64-year low.  So desperate has the economic slide become that
when the GDP tumbled only 9.6% in the third quarter, the
numbers were hailed by Zedillo's Finance Secretary Guillermo
Ortiz Martinez as a sign that "the crisis was over."
     In September of 1995, when Zedillo went before the nation
to deliver his annual state of the union message (the shortest
ever), the words most used to describe Mexico's current state
of affairs were "grave" and "crisis."  These terms were used
a total of 27 times.
     From 1981 through 1989, Mexicans endured versions of "La
Crisis."  These were actually a series of crises associated
with short-term debt obligations and the falling price of oil.
Lyable.
Moratoriums, led by debtors' unions like El Barzon, have so
constricted liquidity that some bankers admit privately their
only cash flow comes from money linked to narcotrafficking.
     Zedillo's crisis is also a monetary crisis.  Since the
"December errors," the peso has lost 55% of its worth and some
analysts predict the exchange rate will soon reach 10 nuevo
pesos per US$1.00.  Indeed, Mexico's currency has become
extremely vulnerable to speculators, forcing the Banco de
Mexico (central bank) to intervene by spending hundreds of
millions of dollars loaned last February by the US and the
International Monetary Fund.
     Despite the interventions, the peso is buying less and
less every day.  Inflation is expected to reach 50% in 1995,
a seven-year high, and it now takes two and one half minimum
salaries to buy the basic food basket.
     Zedillo's crisis is not yet a debt crisis as was the case
with La Crisis of 1982.  However, default remains a strong
possibility in the near future.  The nation's combined public
and private debt ended 1995 at close to US$162 billion, 36% of
the GDP and the highest dollar amount ever.  Mexico, which is
now banking export oil revenue in the US Federal Reserve as
collateral for the US-IMF bailout, transfered US$19 billion to
the exterior in debt service in 1995.  In 1996, the government
is expected to pay out another US$25 billion to service the
debt.
     Zedillo's crisis is a also a crisis for the super-rich.
The economic boom under the Salinas administration created 24
Mexican billionaires, but during 1995 only 10 of those
billionaires remained in the rankings of Forbes magazine.
     But Zedillo's crisis is mostly a crisis for the poor and
the extremely poor.  According to the Social Development
Secretariat (Sedesol), 2.5 million poor are at risk of falling
from poverty to extreme poverty, which is defined by the
United Nations as an inability to earn enough to meet one's
nutritional needs.  Under Zedillo, nearly one-fifth of the
population is going to bed hungry every night.  (Cont.)

ZEDILLO'S FIRST YEAR: PRESIDENT,
OR PRISONER OF CRISIS? (Part 2)

     Zedillo's crisis is a nutritional crisis for many
Mexicans.  The price of tortillas has risen three times this
year, for an accumulated 50% increase.  The government's
national nutrition institute (Instituto Nacional de Nutricion)
reports 41% of all births in public hospitals are low weight,
due to poor maternal nutrition.
     The crisis is also one of health care.  Mexico has
registered more cholera cases in 1995 than in any other year
since reporting began.  A regional epidemic of dengue fever is
wracking poor southern Mexican villages.
     Zedillo's crisis has impacted education as well.
According to one organization that advocates for the rights of
families, 150,000 students have had to transfer from private
to pubic schools, straining facilities and exhausting school
lunch programs.
     Zedillo's crisis is also an emotional crisis.  According
to statistics from Mexico City authorities, a record 40 people
have flung themselves before subway trains in the capital this
year.  Meantime, El Barzon claims that 400 of its members,
including its leader in Coahuila state, have committed suicide
since the crisis began, due to financial troubles.
     Indeed, Miguel Garcia, a psychologist who runs a Mexico
City suicide hot line, established after the devastating 1985
earthquake, says that La Crisis has taken a more severe toll
than the earthquake.  "For many, an economic crisis quickly
becomes an emotional one," Garcia said.
     Zedillo's crisis has been worsened by natural disasters.
As the peso skidded last January, the Popocateptl volcano
belched black smoke outside of Mexico City, causing thousands
to flee in panic.  Mexico has also sustained severe damage
from two hurricanes in 1995, one of which knocked out 90% of
off-shore oil production in October.  In addition, the country
has had to cope with a series of frightening earthquakes,
including a temblor on Oct. 10 that measured 7.2 on the
Richter scale, and which leveled hotels and other tourist-
related infrastructure in some areas of Mexico's Pacific
Coast.
     Unlike the debt crisis of 1982, Mexicans have not quietly
accepted the sacrifices imposed upon them.  Rebellion and
social protest are thriving.  Indeed, Mexico City authorities
recorded an average of eight marches a day in 1995.
Demonstrators daily block boulevards, banks, and even the
Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), curtailing activity on the
trading floor.  When recruiters failed to appear for a job
fair this September, 20,000 professionals battled riot police,
using their briefcases as weapons.
     While the capitan president to consider stepping aside.
     For some, such as the PAN, Zedillo's crisis has created
unprecedented opportunities in municipal and gubernatorial
elections.  Indeed, Guanajuato's PAN Governor, Vicente Fox,
describes the crisis faced by Zedillo and the PRI as a
"pinata" for his party.  The PAN unseated the PRI from a
gubernatorial post in Jalisco in 1995 and managed to retain
the gubernatorial posts in Baja California and Guanajuato
states.  In addition, the PAN won a number of municipal races
in several large cities in Mexico, including Guadalajara and
Puebla.
     The crisis has also proven a boon for some in the US and
Mexico, including investors in Mexican mutual funds, foreign
travelers, and consumers who can afford to take advantage of
the growing number of bargains offered by supermarket chains
and department stores.
     Another major beneficiary of the recent economic
situation in Mexico is La Crisis editor Carlos Ramirez, who
notes sales of his bulletin have continued to grow steadily
since he started publication earlier in the year.

SOUTH AFRICA'S FLYING START FOR 1996

It has been an incredible start to the year. After Christmas financial
markets in Johannesburg stormed ahead as economic indicators and gold
all turned in the right direction. For many fund managers only now back
after the year-end sojourn on the Cape beaches, it's been a difficult
scenario to adjust to.

Gold, as always a key factor in the SA economy, is at least part of the
reason for optimism in financial markets. The price has been reaching
for $400 an ounce in recent weeks, which has led to a 17% gain in the
JSE All Gold index since Christmas. Within this have been some
phenomenal performances with certain shares rising more than 30%.

The reason for gold's surge is, as always, rather difficult to pin
down. Analysts have been pointing to the shortfall of new mined gold
when compared with supply for some time. The year end report published
by Gold Fields Minerals Services highlighted that demand reached a
record 3642 tons in 1995, while output was down with the SA mines'
production falling 10% to 523 tons - the lowest level in 40 years.

Not by gold alone

That there was such large hedging activity in 1995 probably held the
gold price back. With the massive forwards and option deals of the SA
producers now completed, the mood in the gold market has improved and
some analysts, mostly chartists, are talking a price well over $410 an
ounce for 1996 compared with the $380 level of 1995.

But it has not just been gold which has buoyed the market and led to
rather optimistic forecasts for the year ahead. During 1995 SA's
Reserve bank had notable success on the inflation front, with the rate
falling from 10% to under 7%. This contributed to a bull run in the
bond market in 1995, with rates falling from nearly 17% to 13.6%.

Foreign demand was in part behind the run. In 1995, foreigners were net
buyers of nearly R2bn of SA bonds on the JSE alone. This compares with
R1.2bn in 1994. While there has been some profit taking in January, the
demand has contributed to large capital inflows and strength in the
rand. The rand is currently trading at 3.62 to the dollar, which is
stronger than many analysts had forecast a year ago.

Further rand strength is not being ruled out, and there is growing
consensus that further relaxation in exchange control will take place,
possibly in the March budget. In the first quarter of 1995, the
government merged the financial and commercial rands and promised
further relaxation if capital inflows and inflation allowed. Later in
the year, asset swaps by local institutions were given the nod.

Economic data suggest the Bank will be comfortably able to relax
controls even further. The sharp R2.2bn rise in December's gold and
foreign exchange reserves - in a month normally characterised by
seasonal outflows  - has pushed cover on imports to nearly two months
compared with the Reserve Bank's three month target. Further inflows in
the next quarter should make three months cover possible.

This strong reserve position and inflation being under control suggest
that local institutions may be granted further leave to invest
offshore. Speculation is mounting that from March the Bank will allow
them to invest a proportion of their cashflows internationally.

Other signs for a more liberal new year come from recent government
statements about privatisation. While labour has responded angrily, it
appears that government is determined to sell some of the state's
assets to fund development. Deputy president Thabo Mbeki announced in
December the state's intention to sell off part of SA Airways, Telkom,
the airports company, Autonet and Transkei Airways.

Labour's response was one of anger at a lack of consultation. Protests
and work stoppages will probably slow the privatisation process. But
that it will go ahead is reasonably certain. At present the state is
looking at ways to cushion the impact on labour of privatisation.

With good economic news and booming markets, South Africa has entered
1996 in good spirits and with the prospect that the economy will move
further down the road of economic liberation to follow what has
happened on the political front in recent years.

The major blight on the landscape, however, is the violence in KwaZulu-
Natal and crime, neither of which seems much closer to resolution.

ZIMBABWE - STREET RIOTS AND FOREIGN JUNKETS

The year has begun with as much cheerful portent for Zimbabwe and its
economy as the soothsayer who told Julius Caesar to keep his eye on the
Ides of March.

Within days of each other, the country's most authoritative economic
periodicals , issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and Anglo
American Corporation-owned First Merchant Bank (FMB), have expressed
disturbing misgivings over the country's deepening economic crisis, and
the government's apparent inability to grapple with it seriously.

A promising start to the rainy season, says SCB, may provide gdp growth
of at least 5%, if the wet weather holds out. But working against the
keenly-awaited rebound in agriculture, until now seen as the engine of
Zimbabwe's growth, are high real interest rates that are unlikely to
drop until, at best, the latter half of the year.

Whether the punitive lending rates - a bank  overdraft attracts 41% -
can be pulled down, depends on whether the government can reduce its
budget deficit in a sustained manner, instead of its current ad hoc
style, the bank says. State spending cuts are in force, with real
government expenditure set to drop 10% in the fiscal year to June 30,
but the main cuts have been in public sector investment, which, the
bank says , "is precisely the wrong solution for a country in
Zimbabwe's situation."

The cutbacks will add to 1995's "substantially lower"rate of
investment, and any recovery in the manufacturing sector, with
production running at its lowest in 11 years, is expected to be
"relatively weak"because of the deep-seated problems faced by the
sector.

The fundamental issue is the vigorous implementation of ESAP II, the
second phase of the country's IMF-designed economic reforms, following
the failure of the first, says the bank. At the top of the list is
macroeconomic stabilisation with critical reforms that include
privatisation of state-owned companies, the establishment of export
processing zones and an industrial strategy.

So far, the bank notes, there has not even been any hint of open debate
on reform - in the way that South Africa published white papers and
draft programmes - being offered by the government. FMB attacks the
issue of unemployment, and is rather less restrained in its comment
than SCB.

In the six years since 1990, when ESAP I began, 820 000 people with
four or more years secondary school behind them, have entered a job
market that has been able to find work in the formal sector for less
than 20% of them. By the year 2000, another 750 000 will have moved
through the same educational process, but by then there will be as many
of them with the same qualifications in the ages of 17 - 30 but who
have no work, as there are no formal sector jobs.

It is automatically assumed, says FMB, that the government is giving
the unemployment crisis its highest possible priority, but this hardly
appears to be the case.

If the jobless crisis had been caused by deliberate measures taken by a
foreign power, "we would consider them acts of war. But we are doing
them to ourselves,"the bank says.

Export processing zones could have been one way of absorbing some of
the surplus highly educated labour pool, says FMB. But it has taken the
government seven years to come up with legislation promulgating EPZs,
and now, it adds, implementation is being delayed yet again, this time
with the trivial issue of who is going to be on the boards to run the
zones. "We can already see signs of a potentially destructive course
being taken as the river of unemployed becomes a flood of angry,
disillusioned people,"warned FMB.

Mugabe shows no sign of sharing the concerns of the two bulletins.His
preoccupation this year is to stand in presidential elections, and in a
New Year interview with the state-controlled daily The Herald, spoke of
his vision in his imminent third term as head of state, of dramatically
enhanced industrial development and heavy state investment in
infrastructure and agriculture. And anyone hoping for a New Year mini
cabinet shuffle bearing a new minister of finance - three months after
the death of previous minister Aristson Chambati - to take charge of
the reforms desperately needed, was disappointed.

The last months of 1995 were marked by unprecented anti-government
street riots.   Deep fissures also appeared in the monolithic ruling
ZANU(PF) party as voters put an independent MP and mayor into office in
constituencies where the party's dominance was previously unquestioned.

The public perception of how Mugabe feels the situation is continual
junkets abroad with huge delegations of officials and members of his
family, and pay increases to himself and senior party members in the
order of around 130%.

ADVERTISING PROSPECTS FOR 1996: "MINDSETS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE"

At a time when new media opportunities continue to fragment the
channels of commercial communication, an alarming trend has appeared in
South African media consumption: people are reading, watching and
listening less.

This decline, in evidence over the last two or three years, poses the
greatest challenge facing advertisers as 1996 dawns.

Simply put, not only is the pie getting smaller, but what is left is
being cut into smaller slices. This makes it more complex and expensive
to reach the same audiences as before.

Newspaper circulations have shown an average decline of 7% (for the 26
leading urban dailies and weeklies between the first half of 1994 and
the same period of 1995.) But some have suffered significantly greater
losses and over a longer period of time.

Circulation of The Star, formerly the country's biggest daily, has
fallen 23% since its 1990 peak, from 235,000 to 182,000. Half the loss
was experienced in the last year.

Initially there was a hope that readership would not decline as well,
but would be compensated for by greater pass-along readership --a
common response to economic hardship. But when the readership survey
came in ti showed a 21% decline in "reading events" since 1993: the
number of times when somebody picks up a newspaper or magazine during
its issue period has fallen from 46.4 million in 1993 to 36.9 million
in 1995.

This is of critical concern to advertisers, who are attracted to
advertise in a newspaper primarily by the number of readers it can
offer.

TV viewing has also slumped, though recently the pace of the decline
has slowed. In the first half of 1995, peak-time audiences were 20%
lower than they had been two years earlier. More recently, they have
been running about 10% behind 1994's figures.

The blame for this has been placed on the South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC), which has converted its bias in favour of white
Afrikaners into one in favour of black Africans.

`What is clearly happening,' says Hennie van Deventer, chief executive
of the Afrikans publishing house, National Newspapers, "is that
Afrikaans people, estranged by the strange happenings at the SABC, are
turning to newspapers to provide them with the information they need."
His belief is supported by the fact that Afrikaans newspapers are among
the handful of exceptions to the general decline in circulations.

Adds Ken Owen, editor of the country's biggest newspaper, the 500 000 -
circulation Sunday Times: "It's hard to escape the suspicion that
rightwing newspapers, including the Afrikaans press, succeed because
they give dispossessed whites a voice."

The picture is more erratic in radio listening, with some stations
showing massive increases and others showing equally large losses.
Among the services previously positioned to appeal to whites, declines
of up to 42% have been recorded. In the SABC's English-language
channel, whose audience tends to be older and white, programmes and
announcers were changed to reflect the new political environment. The
audience fell from 643,000 to 373,000 in a year.

African language stations, on the other hand, have shown a slight but
not statistically significant fall. While some see this as evidence of
white racism, it is more constructive to view the issue in marketing
terms.

"Strong newspaper circulations depend on a strong sense of community,"
says Gail York, research manager at Times Media, one of the four big
newspaper groups. "The papers that appear to have held fast have a
sense of community. Those that have a vast demographic spread of
readers appear to be the ones that have suffered the most."

In addition to the Afrikaans newspapers, others whose circulations have
not declined include Business Day (serving the business community),
local community newspapers and newspapers targeted at the black
community.

Noel Coburn, joint managing director of Caxton, the leading publisher
of community newspapers, says declining circulations are attributable
to a failure to remain "relevant" to their consumers.

Numerous other factors probably play a part in the trend, including
disaffection with an unvaried diet of "bad" news (particularly crime),
a deterioration in news interest after the 1994 general election, an
end to costly circulation wars in which sales were boosted by
competitions and prizes and, of course, the proliferation of new media.

Satellite TV damp squib

A flood of new magazines and one new newspaper have been launched, 80
community radio stations have been licensed (of which 56 so far are in
operation), and new satellite TV channels have also come on stream.
(Although it must be said that the satellite TV era has thus far proved
a damp squib because of production problems at the factories
manufacturing reception equipment and decoders.)

What all this means is that advertisers are finding it harder and more
costly than ever to reach their markets. Says Chris Rainford, media
director of Bates South Africa, a leading advertising agency: "It used
to be possible to reach 60% or more of your target market through a
single TV channel. This is no longer possible."

"Previously high reach was always a given" says Gordon Muller, media
director of Saatchi & Saatchi Klerck & Barrett. "I am telling my
clients the party is over. You can no longer go on TV with an
objective of reaching 80% of your target market. Now we may set reach
objectives of 40%. With this lower level of exposure, marketers will
want their advertising to be more focused. Mindsets will have to
change."

The good news

There may be some considerable compensation, however. Economic growth
in 1996 is expected to be at least 4.5%, and given the end of the
devastating drought of the last six years could be even higher.

Advertising expenditure tends to be a highly volatile concurrent
economic indicator, and it is likely to rise even more strongly. "We
expect an excellent year"says Reg Lascaris, whose ad agency, Hunt
Lascaris TBWA, is the third biggest in the country.

MEDIA EXPLOSION IMPACTS ON BRAND NAMES

Cadbury's may not melt under an assault of Mars Bars, but SA hamburgers
have become hidden under Mac's and Pepsi is trying to float Coke out of
the market.

While SA consumers are facing an unprecedented barrage of foreign goods
coming onto the market, SA manufacturers - in particular top corporates
like SA Breweries and the Rembrandt group - are waking up to the need
to develop strong brand identities.

Advertising - the media it supports, and the companies that support
both, face challenging times in SA. Cape Town's 3-D advertising agency
notes that a media explosion, "unprecedented in history", is upon us.

Consumers are also confronted with interactive TV, electronic
newspapers, advertising disks, selective binding magazines and the
Internet.

But Raymond Perrier, of Interbrand-Sampson points out that this
plethora of information may lead some consumers to retire to the safety
of well-known brands, "for example, faced with dozens of new computers
and computer packages they may retreat to names they know well such as
IBM, instead of experimenting."

The value of brand equity

The value of brand equity, not well observed in SA, has increasingly
become more tangible - when Philip Morris bought Kraft it paid four
times the book value and when Nestle acquired Wilson Rowntree
intangible assets represented more than 80% of the purchase price. The
value of a brand lies in its expected future earnings.

Perrier suggests that part of the reason why SA's undervalue their
brands and rely on advertising agencies for branding, is because most
major corporates lack marketeers on their boards. " A top businessman I
recently spoke to here noted that more time will be spent in board
meetings discussing the position of a new plant, than how to advance
the brands it will produce."

Perrier says a brand is more than just packaging and advertising, it is
about the adoption of a corporate culture. He suggests that the success
of British Airways new branding was that it  not only looked at
advertising, it changed the tail design of aircrafts, uniforms and
retrained staff, with company policy reflecting that they had 2500
brand managers - or each staff member.

The 50 biggest global advertisers spent more than R130bn on the
promotion of their brands during 1993 - or the equivalent of almost a
third of SA's Gross National Product. The USA and Europe together spent
80% of that total. Europe has 20 of the world's top spending
advertisers, followed by Japan with 14, the USA with 13 - including top
ranked spender, Procter and Gamble (R16bn) - and South Korea with
three.

Perrier says SA has to avoid what happened in Eastern Europe when that
opened up and consumers quickly switched to more effectively branded
western goods. What SA could become, he suggests, is a country like
Singapore which serves as a springboard to the rest of Asia, and SA to
Africa.

3-D suggests that ads may become event or programme specific, or small
radio stations may - as some linked newspapers already do - group
together and sell advertising packages.

The big unknown, however, is the Internet or the World Wide Web, it
relays information to around 50m computers and in SA - one of the
fastest growing users of the net - there are an estimated 230 000
users. 3-D Agency points out that it "is the first and only unowned
medium in the world. It is uncensored (and uncensorable), totally
democratic and omni-directional. It is the fastest growing
communication medium in history."

But already major SA ad agency Hunt Lascaris is creating a division
solely to place advertising on the Internet for clients.

More South Africans are becoming computer literate, even schools in
remote areas have been funded by SA and foreign corporates who have
provided solar panels for the generation of electricity and computers
to advance skills of previously disadvantaged students.

Research completed last year by Microsoft and Market Research Africa
shows that one in four SA homes in major urban areas have personal
computers and at least a third of employees use a computer in the
workplace.  There is a strong awareness of the need to be techno-
literate, with 85% of those surveyed saying computer skills were
important to achieve educational and business success.

But it also showed that a third of South Africans are still intimidated
by computers, of whom over half were in the surprisingly young age
group of 18 to 34. Hewlett Packard has noted that South Africans are
turning over computers four times faster than any other nation in the
world at present.

What consumers need in the huge tidal wave of information swamping over
them, is brands they can hold onto.

INDIAN OCEAN STATES OUTSTRIP AFRICAN MARKETS

Indian Ocean states in the form of Mauritius, India, Pakistan and
Singapore offer far greater potential for South african trade in the
next few years than all its African markets.

Figures released by the Indian Consulate in Durban indicate that the
two-way trade in 1994 between India and South Africa accounted for
R900m (#160m), while in the first nine months of 1995 alone it had
soared to R780m.

Trade with Mauritius is expanding even more strongly, and in particular
exports from South Africa to this Indian Ocean island are soaring.
Exports to Mauritius have grown from roughly 1bn rupees in 1991 to 5bn
rupees in 1994 helped by the strong growth of the Mauritius economy,
the relatively low value of the rand and the elimination of sanctions.

This growth in exports is concentrated in the fields of iron, steel,
chemicals, foodstuffs and beverages, and is expected to continue
flourishing. Sharp rises in exports of building materials from South
Africa to the island are expected in view of the boom in hotel
construction in Mauritius. At present, however, the rapid growth in
trade between the two countries is overwhelmingly in South Africa's
favour, with exports to the Republic from Mauritius amounting to only
65m rupees in 1994.

On the other hand, cooperation in foreign tourism between the two
countries could emerge on a significant scale in view of the plans to
develop foreign cruise tourism in Eastern and Southern Africa recently
announced by the Port Management Associations of Eastern and Southern
Africa. It has been claimed that South Africa could double its world
market share of cruise vacations within two years.

Indian Ocean states like Mauritius and India are important to South
Africa because of their rapidly growing economies, and the scope they
provide for the sale of a broad spread of manufactured products which
is in contrast to the Republic's predominantly mineral exports to the
industrial countries.

FEAR AND RESENTMENT OVER SA'S INCREASED DUTY

The decision of the South African government to introduce high duty on
goods of other countries passing through it is expected to affect
multilateral trade between SA and its neighbours.

With suspicion growing in some trade circles of the Southern Africa
Development Community  (SADC) to which South Africa is the latest and
eleventh member, it is feared that the proposed 125% duty on customs
clearance will stifle fair competition and the trade efforts of other
countries.

The South African government has temporarily waived the introduction of
the custom duty to February , anticipating trade protests from some
SADC member countries who utilise its rail-road routes and seaports for
both their imports and exports.

In fact, the 125% customs duty proposal has come at a time when some
SADC member states are questioning the benefits they were deriving from
South Africa, which as they see it continues to pursue almost the same
trade practices as under the former apartheid regime.

For example, some SADC countries suspect that South Africa was
deliberately keeping them out of the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) arrangement in order for it to continue dominating trade
benefits with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland. The South
African government has denied that this was the case with its
traditional partners in the customs union.

However, South Africa's perceived intention to dominate the trade of
the sub-region is expected to draw a backlash from other SADC member
countries, more especially those with a comparatively strong industrial
base and economic potential for growth. Already Zimbabwe has threatened
to retaliate over the withdrawal of some trade concessions by its
southern neighbour.

According to trade statistics, customs duty on a number of goods and
services between Zimbabwe and South Africa has increased some 200 to
300% in the past six months.

For Zambia which has been dependent on South Africa for almost 66% of
its trade since the dawn of multiparty democracy and economic
liberalisation in 1991, the proposed rise in customs duty could be
extremely serious for the country's tottering economy.

The Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce (ZACCI) is particularly
worried and said the bond requirement of 125% duty on customs clearance
which South Africa wants to impose on its trade neighbours would have
far-reaching effects on the general conduct of trade in the sub-region.

According to ZACCI executive director Mr Gideon Phiri, the trade
measure would have a negative effect on the embattled economy of his
country, more especially in the manufacturing, trading and agricultural
sectors.

Landlocked Zambia, which at the moment moves 45% of its cargo through
the port of Durban in South Africa, is likely to suffer the most should
the Pretoria government decide to stick to the new customs duty. Re-
routing its goods through other countries would be too costly for its
run down economy.

A top government official in the ministry of finance in Lusaka
expressed the local feeling that South Africa owed his country
compensation for the country's devastated economy because of the high
price that Zambia paid for South Africa's liberation struggle against
the former apartheid administration when South Africa's African
National Congress (ANC) operated its administrative office in Lusaka.

"We lost lives and properties to give freedom to our colleagues and is
this what we get in return?" the official asked.

This is the general feeling among various Front-line states (Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, and Tanzania), that South Africa should
carry some responsibility for the damage their economies suffered in
supporting its liberation movement.

S A'S RUNAWAY TOURISM BOOM

Foreign tourism generated R7bn (#1.24 bn) in foreign exchange in 1994
and probably reached R9bn in 1995. The boom in foreign tourism is
expected to be sustained in 1996, and the South African Tourism Board
claims that the government is hopeful that this industry will overtake
gold mining within four years to become the biggest earner of foreign
exchange at around R20 bn a year.

This phenomenal growth in foreign tourism has already meant that the
South African hotel industry is enjoying a boom which is expected to
last for several years.

Hotel bookings for the first nine months of 1995 were more than 33% up
from 1994's figure of 7.6 m "bed nights" to more than 10 m "bed nights"
according to the latest figures from the Central Statistical
Service(CSS). The CSS figures indicate that the number of "bed nights"
sold will have broken all records for 1995.

In September 1995 alone, hotels in aggregate accommodated almost double
the number of overseas visitors compared with the same month in 1994,
with the figure up to 203 422 compared with 109 939. More than 50% of
the foreigners who visited the country over the nine month period to
September 1995 came from Europe, led by the United Kingdom and Germany,
followed by Africa with 17% and the Far East with 15%.

For 1995 as a whole the number of foreign tourists is estimated to have
increased by 45%.

The boom in the hotel industry has spread to the bed and breakfast
sector which has traditionally been an insignificant sector of the
market. This sector has now grown into an important segment of the
accommodation industry since the launch of John Read's pilot project in
Johannesburg in 1984. Guest houses have also mushroomed, some of which
focus on offering farm accommodation to tourists in various scenic
parts of the country.

Numerous new hotels are coming on stream, including the R180m Park
Hyatt hotel of Hyatt International which has been built in Rosebank,
Johannesburg, and opened in December 1995. In November 1995 the Don
Group launched a R35m expansion upgrading drive which will increase the
capacity of its executive apartment hotel chain by 10% by the end of
1996.

Sandton in Johannesburg is a particularly popular area for new hotel
developments. This is illustrated by the start of building by the
Hilton International group of a 324 roomed hotel costing R203m in the
area, while Stocks Hotels and Resorts plans to open the Sandton Square
Michael Angelo Hotel in May 1996, costing R130m. Rand Merchant Bank,
meanwhile, has indicated that it is conducting negotiations with local
and overseas  groups to build a hotel as part of its 8 hectare site in
Sandton.

In addition, Golden Tulip International, the 10th largest hotel group
in the world, has established a South African operation which aims to
develop and operate 20 hotels in the next two years, starting off with
the signing of a management contract for the R125 m Spier hotel complex
in the Western Cape, D'Owerse Werf in Stellenbosch and Sanbonani in
Mpumalanga.

The boom in foreign tourism is such that domestic travellers at this
stage comprise only a small part of hotel occupancy, and businessman
travelling between Cape Town and Johanesburg are finding it difficult
to book hotels.

Boost for Coaches

The boom is also giving a much needed boost to the bus coach
manufacturing industry in the Republic. The industry produced only 288
buses of more than 7.5 tons in 1993, 348 in 1994  and should have
manufactured roughly 400 in 1995.  Meanwhile , major airlines flying to
South Africa claim that they cannot keep up with the demand for seats.

Some analysts are claiming that, given the new hotel developments in
the pipeline, within a few years there will be a large oversupply of
hotels unless foreign tourism continues rising at around 25 % per
annum. The optimists claim that this is easily within reach.

The number of international airlines flying to Johannesburg has risen
from roughly 19 to 50 in the last two years, and foreign tourism is
going to continue benefiting from this trend. Caledonian Airlines is
planning to introduce charter flights to South Africa from March 1996 ,
while Virgin Airways of Britain has filed a series of applications to
the Civil Aviation Authority for permission to fly from London to
Johannesburg and Cape Town.

Alongside these developments South African Airways has indicated that
its partial privatisation will furnish new opportunities to market
South Africa to foreign tourists, and thereby  generate higher traffic.

Tourism industry spokesman have long expressed fears that crime
directed against both local and foreign tourists would have a
detrimental effect on the growth of the industry. However, in an effort
to address this problem tourist protection units have been established
in the major centres to try and ensure the safety of tourists. The
Durban hospitality  industry plans to train hotel and restaurant
personnel as police reservists to combat crime on the Durban
beachfront.

INDUSTRIAL TAKEOFF AHEAD FOR SALDANHA BAY

The Saldanha Bay area of the Western Cape is set to become a major
industrial complex following Iscor's decision to establish a large
steel mill in the area.  A series of downstream industrial projects are
likely to follow the building of the steel plant, which will transform
the area and furnish a boost to the Western Cape economy.

Iscor has finally given the go-ahead for the Saldanha Steel project
after securing a new site which is 2 kilometres inland of the
controversial Langebaan lagoon site, and after having reduced certain
capital costs of the project by R500 (#89m) with the total capital cost
now estimated to be R6.8bn.

Building will begin immediately and the plant will be commissioned
early in 1998, although it will take another 12 to 18 months before
full capacity of 1.25m tons of hot strip steel is reached, which will
be mainly earmarked for export markets.

The steel project, for which Iscor raised R1.3bn in a rights issue
earlier in 1995, ran aground a few months ago due to opposition from
environmentalists, who criticised the proposed siting of the plant near
to the wetlands in Saldanha.  This opposition led to delays in starting
the plant, and the higher costs of the project associated with the
delay  prompted Iscor to withdraw from the scheme.

The new arrangements.

Under the new arrangements the Industrial Development Corporation, an
equal partner in the project, has restructured the financing plans to
include a greater element of gearing so as to enhance the return to
shareholders.  The project has been further aided by special tax
concessions  by the government.

The Saldanha Steel project itself could still be expanded by doubling
the hot rolled coil capacity of the steel mill.  This has apparently
been allowed for in the layout of the plant.  In addition, businesses
related to the steel industry are now expected to be attracted to the
Saldanha area.  Angola Alpha is reported to be considering building a
cement factory at Saldanha, using the  Corex slag from the steel plant
as its major raw material.

A steel pipe manufacturing plant geared to exporting is also on the
cards since Iscor is prepared to make some of its steel output
available to local processors, and may indeed invest itself in such a
beneficiation project.  A separate stainless steel mill is also
envisaged.  It is also speculated that once the gas field at Kudu off
the Namibian coast is developed, this will create opportunities for
developing new gas-based direct reduction iron, steel and related
industries in the Saldanha area.

The Saldanha Steel project, together with the other potential new
projects, represents the largest industrial economic development phase
ever in the Western Cape, and the expansion at Saldanha could be even
greater in view of the tourist potential of the area.

SAA AIMS FOR NEW HEIGHTS

Nineteen ninety five was the kind of year SA Airways (SAA) would like
to frame. It left the bad years of having to cope with sanctions and a
moribund civil service attitude behind, moved from being a loss-making
local airline into profitability, and became a significant player on
the world stage. This year it will be looking for more partners.

These are some of the year's highlights:

* After four years of losses, which totalled R254m (#45m), it announced
at the end of its financial year on March 31 that it had shown a profit
of more than R217m for fiscal 1995. In terms of sales that made it the
35th biggest airline in the world, and the second biggest in terms of
profit sales.

* It was unable to cope fully with demand. From Germany load factors
averaged 91% for the year. They were higher between SA and Britain. To
provide more seats it bought a 767 and its fleet of 747-SPs, which were
on sale at bargain-basement prices, were taken off the market,
refurbished quickly and brought back into service.  And in November it
ordered two new Boeing 747-400s and nine new Boeing 777s.

* In the middle of December Deputy President Thabo Mbeke announced that
the government was looking for a strategic partner for SAA. That's
another way of saying the process of privatising the airline has begun,
which pleased the private sector, but angered the unions who translated
it into job losses. They retaliated by calling a number of strikes.

* Two days after the first strike SAA and Lufthansa, Europe's biggest
airline, announced a partnership agreement (which does not, at this
stage, include taking equity in each other's operation) in Frankfurt.
It will, says SA Airways' CE Mike Myburgh, boost his airline's bottom
line. He claims that without it SAA would have floundered before the
end of the century.

Looking for a strategic partner

Myburgh is pleased - upbeat may be a better word - government is
looking for a strategic partner for the airline, a partner that will
take equity.

He explains: "Without it we would not be able to attract share capital.
Government has been unwilling to increase its share capital in SAA. We
need more capital to help us balance our debt and make it easier for us
to pay for our new aircraft.

"In our present situation, where cash flows are high because our load
factors are very high, and we don't have enough aircraft to take full
advantage of our denser routes, it would be easy to finance the
purchase of those aircraft out of loans. But it would be very difficult
to do that in leaner times."

He thinks the timing of Mbeke's announcement was right. "We showed a
healthy profit last year and are likely to show another one this year,
which makes us attractive to investors. Had the decision been taken in
lean years we would have had to look for investors on their terms.

"We believe the economy will continue to grow for a few years and dip
only in 1998. A partnership will give us access to the finance,
technology  and expertise we were denied in the past."

On the question of who SAA would choose as partners, he said: "The
strong commercial alliances we have built up over the years with, for
example, American Airlines, British Midland, Ansett and very recently
Lufthansa, are important to us and we believe it would be advantageous
to us if we gave them preference.

"We would rather have another airline than a financial institution
become our strategic partner. An airline can get more out of a
relationship with another airline than it can with a financial
institution which, of necessity, would be interested mainly in the
growth of its shares and dividends. By working with another airline we
can do things together, we can build up routes together, even in lean
times, and we can use our combined equipment (aircraft) more
advantageously.

"We would probably also go to the SA market, give black investors the
inside track, and then go to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).

"We would, obviously, make shares available for our employees. I have
been working very hard at promoting emotional ownership of the airline
by getting staff involved in our gainshare scheme - we keep 70% of
super achievement (growth that exceeds a set target) and share the
remaining 30% among staff members. If we can offer financial ownership
as well we will improve staff commitment to the airline."

He understands why the announcement upset the unions. "It does seem as
if the government didn't consult sufficiently with them before making
their intention public. From what Cosatu (the Congress of SA Trade
Unions) has said it could lead to ongoing trouble, but if we talk to
the unions - and that's a very important item on our agenda for the
next few weeks - we can sort out the problem.

"They understood our reasoning for retrenching more than 2000 people
two years ago, why shouldn't they understand what government has in
mind now?'

SA AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS SOAR

Both general morale in the nation and the country's economic growth
prospects for 1996 have ben materially boosted by the copious rains
experienced over large parts of South Africa since early in December
1995.

Many water restrictions introduced in numerous areas in October last
year affecting households have been lifted in line with the significant
boost to dam levels, with the Vaal Dam now 100% full for the first time
since 1989. Underground water reserves have been replenished,
irrigation dams boosted, and good grazing conditions in most areas are
guaranteed for the next nine months or so.

A few maize crops are waterloggied after the exceptionally heavy rains,
 but the overall picture is very promising, and if normal rainfall
occurs in the rest of January and February the national crop could well
exceed 10 tons compared with 4.23 tons last year.  A record crop,
however, is unlikely since this year's maize area is around 3m
hectares, which  is well below the past 10 year average of 3.5 m. This
reflects diversification on some farms towards sunflower seed,
groundnuts and wheat.

The 1995-96 wheat crop is now estimated to reach some 2.28m tons
compared with 1.83m tons in 1994-95. The country will, however, still
have to import some 360 000 tons to meet total domestic demand of about
2.4 m tons.

Meanwhile, the good rains should boost sugar output by about 25% to
2.1m tons this season, and the amount available for export should
roughly double this year. The country could have between 700 000 and
800 000 tons of sugar available for export this year compared with last
year's export yield of between

350 000 and 400 000 tons.  The sugar industry is indeed looking forward
to its best season in four years.

The agricultural sector now accounts for approximately 5% of the gross
domestic product, and since the output of the sector  could grow by
around 20% this year provided reasonable rains fall in the next month
or so, the overall economy could receive a boost of some 1% from this
source alone. Moreover, there are indirect benefits on top of this,
since  agriculture has a number of important forward and backward
linkages  in the economy. The purchase of tractors and fertilisers, for
instance, are boosted by a good agricultural season.

Some economists are therefore, predicting growth in excess of 4% for
1996, the best performance for 15 years. This in turn partly accounts
for the sharp advance in share prices on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange during the first week of the new year.

 ARGENTINA: CAVALLO FINALLY SACKED JUST BEFORE FRESH ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS 
with IMF

 Economy minister Domingo Cavallo should have known that his number was up 
when President Carlos Menem gave him his full backing on 19 July, in the 
face of concerted attacks from the trade unions and deputies of the ruling 
Partido Justicialista (see WR-96-29). The trouble is, it had happened so 
many times before that it was difficult to know when the President no longer 
meant what he said. On 26 July, Menem gave Cavallo the sack.

 The long-serving minister had been at loggerheads with both President and 
party for so long that there seemed no reason to suppose the latest episode 
was any different from earlier ones.

 Only days before he was dismissed, Cavallo had prevailed upon Menem to push 
through, by presidential decree, a new round of unpopular fiscal austerity 
measures. These were in response to figures indicating that tax revenues in 
the first half-year had fallen well short of what was expected, leading to a 
fiscal deficit of US Dollars 2.508bn: slightly more than the total agreed 
with the International Monetary Fund for the whole year.

 Cavallo had been due to begin negotiations with the Fund in mid-August for 
a waiver on the targets set in the earlier agreement. He prepared the way by 
ordering a series of spending cuts and tax increases, designed to cut the 
deficit by up to US Dollars 1bn a year.

 Some 2.4m workers stood to lose benefits when state aid for dependent 
families was cut, and more than 1m may face reductions in food subsidies 
paid by employers as part of the total wage.

 The trade unions grouped in the Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT), 
traditionally associated with the ruling Peronist party, responded by 
calling a general strike for 8 August, just before talks with the Fund were 
due to begin.

 Unions feel that the workers have been made to carry the can for the 
failures of government economic policies -just as PJ deputies feel the party 
suffered the consequences of their unpopularity in the Buenos Aires mayoral 
elections at the end of June.

 Relations between government and unions have been made even more strained 
by the latest unemployment figures, which put joblessness in the country as 
a whole at 17.1%. The figure last October was an already high 16.4%. The 
situation is considerably worse in Buenos Aires, at 20.4%.

 Menem has promised that the replacement of Cavallo by central bank 
president Roque Fernandez means no changes to economic policy. Foreigners, 
who loved Cavallo, may take some convincing.

 CHILE: COPPER: SUMITOMO SCANDAL CAUSES HEADACHES: CODELCO RECALCULATES 
REVENUE PROJECTIONS

 While the rest of the world has been debating whether or not former 
Sumitomo copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka was a rogue operator out of the Nick 
Leeson mould, Chileans in general and the state-owned Codelco copper 
corporation in particular have been recalculating their projections of 
export earnings for this year.

 Price falls. There seems little doubt that the fall in the world copper 
price in the wake of the Sumitomo debacle will cut Chile's foreign exchange 
revenues and add to the country's swelling current account deficit this year 
(see detailed figures in WR-96-28). There will be longer-term effects, too.

 One of them is that the US Dollars 240m Lomas Bayas mine project is being 
delayed by Gibraltar Mines of Canada, as it has been unable to raise the 
necessary financing. The company had been hoping to bring the mine onstream 
in 1998, with annual output of 60,000-90,000 tonnes per year.

 Chile currently produces about 30% of the world's copper (1.2m tpy), and 
investment plans aim to raise that proportion to 40% by the beginning of the 
new millennium. So any reduction in its revenues, and any delays in 
investment projects, have potentially serious implications.

 By mid-July, Codelco had calculated that its income would fall by about US 
Dollars 500m this year. Profits in 1995 amounted to US Dollars 1.7bn, thanks 
to an average world price of US Dollars 1.34/lb. This year marketing vice-
president Juan Eduardo Herrera puts projected revenues no higher than US 
Dollars 1.2bn, on the assumption that the copper price will be around US 
Dollars 1.05-US Dollars 1.10/lb by the end of the year. Original 
calculations were based on an average price of US Dollars 1.15-US Dollars 
1.20/lb.

 Herrera remains optimistic, however, that the situation might begin to 
improve from September, by which time the depressing effect on prices of 
Sumitomo's desperate unloading of its copper stocks, in an attempt to recoup 
losses of US Dollars 1.8bn, might have begun to work itself out.

 Military share. One contentious proposal put forward by Codelco to offset 
the loss of revenues is to stop paying the armed forces the 10% share of 
gross sales revenues to which they are entitled by law. This idea has 
already been put forward by Codelco executive president Juan Villarzu, 
backed by Herrera. The government, however (and of course the military), are 
not keen.

 Villarzu sees the transfer of all military financing obligations to the 
general state budget as the only way to keep Codelco's investment plans -and 
particularly exploration projects in Peru and Argentina- on track. Codelco 
paid over US Dollars 340m to the military last year.

 The government, however, nipped this idea in the bud. 'It's not on our 
agenda,' said interior minister Carlos Figueroa in mid-June. He added that, 
however reasonable the proposal might seem, and however much support it 
might have across the political spectrum, this was not a good moment to 
suggest it.

 Another possible way forward for Codelco -privatisation of the company, as 
advocated by the right-wing opposition- has also been ruled out by the 
government. It proposes instead a restructuring of the corporation, under 
which each mine would become an autonomous division, making its own business 
decisions.

 Legislation to that effect has been passed by the lower house of congress 
but blocked in the senate, where the opposition argues that it envisages an 
unacceptably subordinate role for private capital. The government retorts 
that private interests are welcome to enter into exploration agreements with 
Codelco, as Cyprus Amax has done for the El Abra project. But the four big 
existing mines -Chuquicamata, El Teniente, Adina and Salvador, plus the new 
Radomiro Tomic project -must remain in state hands.

 CLUES TO CODELCO FRAUD

 One positive side-effect of the Sumitomo affair might be to cast some light 
on the fraud perpetrated against Codelco by one of its traders in 1993. Juan 
Pablo Davila lost US Dollars 175m for Codelco by unsuccessful speculation in 
the futures market over a period of about four years, and was imprisoned for 
his pains. He still faces trial on fraud charges.

 Codelco is anxious to find out if Davila and Hamanaka had the same 
international contacts and used the same methods for concealing their 
operations. The corporation has already suggested that the London Metals 
Exchange should tighten up its regulatory procedures, which it regards as 
inadequate to control the activities of skilful speculators.

 PINOCHET SUCCESSION

 One reason why the government does not want to rock the boat over military 
finances is that the delicate matter of the succession to General Pinochet 
as commander-in-chief of the army is currently under discussion.

 Defence minister Edmundo Perez Yoma confirmed at the beginning of July that 
President Eduardo Frei would use a special law to defer the retirement of 
one of four senior generals for a year to smooth the transition from 
Pinochet when he finally bows out in March 1998.

 The four senior generals due to retire on 30 September this year, who might 
be beneficiaries of the so-called 'Canessa law,' are deputy commander 
Guillermo Garin, chief of staff Ricardo Quas, inspector-general Jaime Concha 
Pantoja and the commander of the first army corps, Ramon Castro Ivanovic.

 ROBOTS IN THE MINES

 Aware that a low level of technological innovation is one of the weak 
points of its development model (see WR-96-27), the Chilean government has 
begun to experiment with automated systems in the copper mines. The El 
Teniente division of Codelco announced at the beginning of July that it 
would use Chilean-developed robots in its new Esmeralda mine, which is 
expected to come onstream in the second half of next year.

 Economy minister Alvaro Garcia has called for a doubling of the present 
level of investment in technological innovation, which is only 0.8% of GDP, 
or US Dollars 480m a year; 23% of that is spent by the private sector.

 CHILE: DRUGS: SEVEN HELD AFTER BIG COCAINE BUST: FORMER COLOMBIAN DIPLOMAT 
AMONG THOSE ARRESTED

 The seizure of 600kg of cocaine in the port of San Antonio, south of 
Santiago, on 10 July focused attention once again on the increasing use of 
Chile as a transit country for drug shipments from Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia to markets in other parts of the world. It also revived interest in 
a scandal allegedly involving drug-trafficking in the Chilean congress.

 Seven arrests. The interior ministry announced a tightening-up of controls 
at ports, airports and frontier crossings in the wake of the San Antonio 
episode, for which seven people were subsequently arrested, including two 
Colombians.

 One of them, Alberto Botero, was a former diplomat assigned to Santiago who 
had left the Colombian foreign service in 1995 to go into the clothing 
import business in the city. His sister, Constanza, was also detained after 
her arrival from Colombia a few days before the seizure. An examining 
magistrate, Marcos Felzestein, has been put in charge of the case.

 Carabineros General Ruben Olivares, head of the anti-drug directorate, said 
Chile had been selected as a transit country because of the high 
international reputation of its exporters; the mere fact that goods were 
from Chile meant that customs checks in the United States and Europe were 
less rigorous than usual.

 The San Antonio consignment, the biggest ever confiscated in Chile, with an 
estimated street value of US Dollars 14.5m, had been bound for Miami. The 
drugs were concealed in three autoclaves, used for sterilising surgical 
instruments, all of which had false bottoms.

 The merchandise had been unloaded in a container a few days earlier from a 
Colombian-flag merchant ship, belonging to the Flota Mercante 
Grancolombiana. The Chilean customs authorities did not believe the shipping 
line was aware of what was in the container. The gang involved had been 
under surveillance for two months, the police reported.

 The largest previous confiscation of cocaine in Chile was in 1989, when 
500kg of the drug were found in a container in the port of Arica. 

 Enter Investigaciones. Que Pasa magazine claimed in mid-July that 
Carabineros had been dragging their feet over the inquiry into the alleged 
drug-trafficking racket in congress, forcing Valparaiso examining magistrate 
Roberto Contreras to turn to the plain-clothes police (Investigaciones) for 
help with phone-tapping and covert surveillance -operations in which 
Carabineros refused to become involved.

 The right-wing magazine claims that officials of the ruling Christian 
Democrat group in congress were implicated, and at least one of those 
interrogated had agreed to cooperate under a plea-bargaining arrangement. 
The involvement of deputies, it said, had yet to be established. 
Distributors and buyers of the cocaine, which was brought into Chile through 
Arica, appeared to be administrative and security personnel of both 
chambers.

 On 28 June the first arrests were made by Investigaciones, including the 
former secretary of the PDC group in congress, Maria Luisa Espejo.

 Nelson Mery, head of Investigaciones, said at the beginning of the year 
that drug-trafficking was his main target, and that he was in favour of all 
public officials submitting to random drug tests.

 CHILE: ECONOMY: INCOME INEQUALITY JIBE UPSETS ANINAT: MINISTER SAYS HIGH 
GROWTH, LOW INFLATION ARE THE ANSWER

 Even as a remarkable upsurge in economic activity in April caused the 
government to revise upwards its projection for GDP growth this year from 
6.5% to 7%, concern was growing at the persistent poverty and widening 
income disparities that are the downside of Chile's economic success.

 The central bank reported at the end of June that growth in April was 
10.2%, and 9.3% for the first four months of the year. The figure for the 
whole of last year was 8.3%.

 Aninat regrets. Finance minister Eduardo Aninat hailed the performance as a 
guarantee of more jobs and higher wages. But two weeks later Aninat was 
expressing regret that more people wee not benefiting from the economic 
growth. He said better income distribution was desirable, provided it did 
not disturb the macro-economic equilibrium Chile had achieved at such cost.

 The minister was reacting to a World Bank report, released in Washington at 
the end of June, which said Chile had one of the most unequal income 
distributions in the world. He asserted that steady 7% growth and low 
inflation (the target is 6.5% this year) would bring greater equality of 
incomes.

 Aninat took exception to the World Bank's interpretation of Chilean 
statistics, which it said showed that 20% of the population had 61% of the 
national income. The true figure was 56%, Aninat said.

 The Bank gives Chile an income inequality index of 0.56 (on a scale of 0-
1), which is second only to Brazil (0.60) in South America.

 The Chilean government's own surveys suggest that 28% of the population 
live in poverty.

 An opinion poll in mid-July indicated that 55% of Chileans regard the 
current neo-liberal economic model as unfair -compared with 46% a year ago. 
But 55% also approve of the government's performance.

 CHILE: INSIGHT: CHILE SORTS OUT BANKS' SUBORDINATE DEBT: IN THE PROCESS, IT 
LOSES A CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT

 The recent resignation of Chile's central bank president, Roberto Zahler, 
was triggered, in his own words, by 'situations in recent months' -which he 
did not spell out, but which most analysts read as alluding to political 
pressures for a solution to a particular, longstanding problem: the US 
Dollars 4.3bn 'subordinate debt' still owed by several banks to the central 
bank for bailing them out of the crisis of 1982.

 Zahler is said to have adopted a 'tough' stand on this matter, which left 
him in a minority of one in the five-member board of the central bank. The 
precise nature of this stand is not known, but the solutions that the board 
has been approving are.

 Of the five banks who still owed substantial sums of 'subordinate debt' at 
the beginning of this year, one -Banco BHIF- has already repaid its 
obligations with the proceeds of an issue of American Depositary Receipts 
(ADRs). The state of play with the four that remain is as follows:

 Banco Concepcion (which owes US Dollars 669m) and Banco Internacional (US 
Dollars 130m) will be settling their debts soon, with an issue of shares 
which will be given to the central bank in lieu of payment -and will then be 
bought back by the shareholders at a substantial discount (about US Dollars 
182m, or 78% of their joint debt).

 Banco de Chile, which owes US Dollars 1.74bn, has struck a deal which will 
allow it to repay its debt over 40 years, also with a substantial (but as 
yet unspecified) discount.

 Banco de Santiago, which owes US Dollars 1.76bn, still has a year in which 
to reach a settlement -and is also certain to benefit from a hefty discount.

 Valparaiso-based consultant Armen Kouyoumdjian* reckons that the entire 
settlement exercise will cost the central bank about US Dollars 1.6bn.

 Attention will naturally focus on the details of the deals with the two 
last banks mentioned, Santiago and Chile, who jointly account for 81% of the 
'subordinate debt' still outstanding -and which are the two most powerful 
private banks in Chile's financial system.

 Jointly they account for just over 21% of all the lending in the Chilean 
market (11.5% for Chile and 9.6% for Santiago). The only institution with a 
larger market share is the state-owned Banco del Estado, with 12%. They are 
also quite unique in that they seem to disprove an item of common wisdom 
about Latin American banking: that big does not always mean profitable.

 These two banks, the biggest private lenders, are also the two with the 
highest returns on equity -if, that is, the 'subordinate debt' is left out 
of the calculations. (Actually, this holds true for many of the second-tier 
banks: of the next five in market share, four are among the Chilean system's 
10 most profitable banks).

 The accompanying graphs, which illustrate the position of the Chilean 
banking system at the end of June this year, show that private locally-owned 
banks are more profitable, as a group, than state banking, and that the 
latter is more profitable than the foreign-owned banks -the big exception 
being Banco Santander, which ranks both among the big lenders, with a 7% 
share, and among the 10 most profitable in the country.

 It is among the foreign-owned banks that one finds the only three 
lossmakers at mid-year: American Express, Boston and Real.

 *In his privately distributed Occasional Paper No17, The Chilean Financial 
System, of 19 July -which also provided the statistical base for the graphs 
accompanying this article.

 By the way, the appointment of a successor to Zahler may not be announced 
for another month or so. Among the candidates being mentioned are Carlos 
Massad, Jose Pablo Arellano, Manuel Marfan, Joaquin Vial and Juan Andres 
Fontaine. The latter, formerly the bank's head of research, is the candidate 
of the opposition -their contribution to an 'independence' already 
compromised by the incorporation of Pablo Pinera.

 CHILE: FOCUS: SO HOW MUCH DID CHILE INVEST ABROAD?: A LOOK AT WIDELY 
DIVERGENT ESTIMATES

 Chile-watchers are entitled to be somewhat confused. In late June, within 
four days of each other, two institutions came out with calculations of the 
amount invested by Chileans in their main foreign market which differed by a 
factor of four.

 The central bank reported that accumulated Chilean investment in Argentina, 
between 1975 and May 1996, had reached US Dollars 1.3bn -almost 42% of the 
total invested abroad by Chileans in that period.

 The Camara de Comercio put the figure for investment in Argentina at US 
Dollars 5.5bn. It did so in the context of a report noting how Peru was 
growing as the second most important market for Chilean investment, with an 
accumulated total, to end-1995, of US Dollars 2.3bn -more than the central 
bank says was invested abroad in the whole of South America.

 Two reasons have been advanced to explain the huge discrepancy between the 
two estimates. One, mentioned by Chilean entrepreneurs to the Argentine 
business magazine Apertura, is that a large portion of Chilean investment 
abroad was financed from external (non-Chilean) sources, and that the 
central bank, quite appropriately, was only accounting that portion of the 
investment which was an outflow from Chile.

 Another, suggested to us by a veteran Chile-watcher, is that in many cases 
what was being counted as Chilean investment was actually the entire value 
of ventures in which the Chileans had only a share, but had also secured the 
management of the scheme.

 The central bank figures show that in the first five months of this year 
Chileans invested abroad a further US Dollars 433.4m, increasing the total 
stock by 16%.

 The Camara de Comercio predicts that by the end of this year, Chilean 
investment in Peru alone will have reached US Dollars 3bn, increasing the 
stock there by 30%.

 The chamber notes that 110 Chilean firms are now established in Peru. About 
a third of these have acquired interests in state companies privatised by 
the Peruvian government; another 40% have set up subsidiaries of their own.

 Apart from becoming Chile's second-largest investment market, Peru is 
growing in importance as an export market: last year Chile exported US 
Dollars 438m (and imported only US Dollars 147m). Talks on a complementation 
agreement, suspended since last November, are about to be resumed.

 CHILE: ENVIRONMENT: GASANDES CHANGES PIPELINE ROUTE: PRESSURE GROUPS WIN 
PARTIAL VICTORY IN CAJON DEL MAIPO

 The protracted conflict between the communities of the Cajon del Maipo and 
the GasAndes consortium, chronicled in these pages (see RS-96-05, RS-95-07), 
was resolved at the end of June, when the two sides signed an agreement. The 
accord with the villages of San Alfonso and Pirque will enable the Chilean-
Canadian consortium to route through the community the pipeline that will 
carry natural gas 465km from Argentina to Santiago and central Chile. 
GasAndes now expects the project to be completed by May 1977.

 Partial victory. The accord represented a partial victory for the people of 
San Alfonso, as the consortium agreed to change the original route of the 
pipeline, diverting it away from residential areas and the Cascada de las 
Animas nature reserve, and stepping up security -the two main demands of the 
local activists.

 Angel Santander, president of the San Alfonso residents' committee, said he 
would have preferred the pipeline to take another route altogether, but his 
committee felt it had made its point, and accepted the agreement to avoid 
further confrontations.

 The precedent has been established, as far as environmentalists are 
concerned, that a community can negotiate directly with a big consortium and 
win important concessions. Manuel Baquedano, president of the Instituto de 
Ecologia Politica, said an 'unprecedented advance' had been achieved.

 Local improvements fund. San Alfonso will appoint its own technical 
commission to supervise the works, and GasAndes will contribute with US 
Dollars 1m to a special fund for improving local amenities.

 The accord was mediated by the chairman of the chamber of deputies, Jaime 
Estevez, following a clash with police in which several people were injured. 
'This is a debate that is only just getting under way in Chile, which 
basically concerns the contradiction between development projects and living 
standards in a community. The country has been growing for 12 consecutive 
years and these sorts of situations are going to arise again and again,' he 
said.

 'NUCLEAR DUSTBIN' PROTESTS 

 Environmental groups have joined residents of the Palena district, 1,600km 
south of Santiago, in rejecting plans for a nuclear waste site at Gastre, in 
Argentina's Chubut province, 160km from the border. Concern about a project 
that dates back to 1980 has been heightened in Chile by the Menem 
government's plans to privatise the nuclear power industry.

 Chile's Comite Pro Defensa de la Flora y Fauna (Codaff) claims that the 
material to be buried at Gastre is highly radioactive, with a half-life of 
250,000 years. Similar protests have taken place in Argentine Patagonia, and 
the governors of the southern provinces have declared the region a nuclear-
free zone.

 Potential bidders for Argentina's three nuclear power stations (one of 
which, Atucha II, is unfinished) have made availability of a waste disposal 
site a condition for their further interest. Legislation paving the way for 
the sale is making its way through the Argentine congress, in the teeth of 
fierce opposition.

 CHILE: NATIVE WOODLANDS ESTIMATE INCREASED: NEW PULP PROJECT PROVOKES 
VALDIVIA PROTEST

 The Chilean ministry of agriculture has upgraded its estimate of the total 
area of native woodlands from 8m hectares to 11m. The figure emerged from 
the country's first forest census, and was designed to allay the concerns of 
ecological groups, which fear that the country's native forests are 
dwindling fast as a result of commercial forestry. Chile's temperate rain 
forests begin at Valdivia, 830km south of Santiago, and continue to Tierra 
del Fuego.

 Agriculture minister Emiliano Ortega conceded that it was vital to protect 
the resource in the face of rising world demand for timber, wood pulp and 
chips. The pulp of native species such as alerce, trepa, coigue, lenga and 
lingue is regarded as particularly suitable for the manufacture of high-
quality computer paper. Chile's exports of forest products totalled US 
Dollars 2.4bn in 1995.

 Exports down. Exports were, however, 20% down by value and 11.3% by volume 
in the first five months of this year: US Dollars 768.7m against US Dollars 
960.9m, Jose Antonio Prado, director of the Corporacion Nacional Forestal 
(Conaf) reported on 17 July.

 Japan (19.9%), South Korea (11.8%) and the US (11.7%) remained Chile's 
principal customers, but international wood pulp and chips prices have 
fallen sharply in the early months of this year.

 Arauco project. One of the biggest wood pulp plants in the world, a 550,000 
tonnes-per-year facility costing up to US Dollars 1bn, is planned for 
Valdivia. But, taking note of growing concerns about the environmental 
impact of development projects (see RS-96-03), the government, through the 
Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente (Conama), is withholding the necessary 
permits until environmentalists' objections are addressed.

 Protected wetlands and a bird sanctuary stand to be affected by toxic 
liquid effluent from the plant, which is to be built by Celulosa Arauco, 
Chile's biggest wood pulp exporter. Proposals for a solution from the 
company threaten the livelihoods of a fishing community further up the 
coast.

 Arauco accounted for 18.7% of Chile's total forestry exports in 1995. 
Second was Celulosa del Pacifico with 10.1%. It is owned by Copec, one of 
Chile's biggest economic groups.

 ARGENTINA: POLITICS: PROTEST VOTE IN BUENOS AIRES POLLS: BOTH RADICALS AND 
FREPASO TROUNCE OFFICIAL CANDIDATE

 The first direct elections for mayor of Buenos Aires at the end of June 
were a triumph for the Union Civica Radical (UCR), a good result for Frente 
Pais Solidario (Frepaso), a disaster for the ruling Partido Justicialista 
(PJ) and a wipe-out for the far-left.

 Comeback for UCR. The UCR, an urban party if ever there was one, has had a 
patchy recent history in the capital, losing out badly to Frepaso in the 
last elections. The victory of Fernando de la Rua, who won almost 40% of the 
votes, was a clear return to favour in the party's traditional stronghold. 
He takes over on 6 August.

 'This should not be seen as the end but the beginning,' De la Rua said, 
referring perhaps not just to the Radicals' revived fortunes but to his own 
hopes of securing the party nomination for the 1999 presidential elections.

 Frepaso did better than expected, in view of its recent splits and internal 
tensions. Norberto La Porta won more than a quarter of the votes, leaving 
the incumbent, Jorge Dominguez (PJ) trailing in a distant third, only just 
ahead of Peronist defector Gustavo Beliz (Nueva Dirigencia), who was backed 
by former Frepaso leader Jose Octavio Bordon (see table).

 It was a huge protest vote against the national government, particularly 
against the corruption with which it has become associated in the public 
mind. La Porta also noted that the result was the voice of the 'pauperised 
middle classes' of the capital, who have suffered from President Carlos 
Menem's downsizing of the public sector.

 Menem attempted, however, to make the best of things, denying that the 
result was a plebiscite on his government's performance, and claiming that 
Dominguez had been the best mayor the city had ever had. He promptly 
appointed him defence minister when a vacancy arose a few days later (see 
below).
Any hope that the extreme left and assorted green parties might have had of 
capitalising on the prevailing disenchantment with the government was 
quickly scotched: they won only 1.9% of the votes between them.

 Frepaso also secured a majority in the assembly, the 60-seat Convencion 
Estatuyente, charged with drawing up the statutes under which the capital 
will henceforth be governed. Chairing the assembly will be Frepaso senator 
Graciela Fernandez Meijide, who has been outspokenly critical of the limits 
placed by the federal government on the supposedly autonomous city 
government's powers.

 GRACIELA FERNANDEZ MEIJIDE

 Senator Fernandez, 65, won 34.75% of the votes as head of the Frepaso list, 
and has established her credentials as a serious candidate for Frepaso's 
presidential nomination in 1999, despite a late start in politics. She 
entered the party at the age of 60, and was elected senator for Buenos Aires 
last October, with 45.6% of the votes.

 A teacher of French, she became a human rights activist after her son 
'disappeared' in 1977, and was a member of the 1984 commission, chaired by 
writer Ernesto Sabato, which investigated the abuses of the military regime.

 FERNANDO DE LA RUA

 The new mayor of the capital is a 58-year-old lawyer from Cordoba. He has 
served three terms as senator for Buenos Aires and was the UCR vice-
presidential candidate in 1973. Ten years later he lost out to Raul Alfonsin 
in a competition for the UCR presidential nomination, but in 1991 became 
head of the party's organisation in the capital.

 ARGENTINA: MENEM LETS THREE MINISTERS GO: BARRA AND CAMILION PRECEDE 
CAVALLO AS DISCONTENT GROWS

 The loss of two cabinet ministers in one week may suggest that President 
Menem has grown careless, after years of standing by his lieutenants through 
thick and thin. There are those who believe his willingness to sacrifice 
first justice minister Rodolfo Barra and then defence minister Oscar 
Camilion had something to do with finding sacrificial victims to placate a 
public grown tired of his government.

 Barra ostensibly went because his right-wing nationalist past caught up 
with him -though, as our sister publication, Latin American Weekly Report, 
pointed out at the time, he had also become an inconvenience for economy 
minister Domingo Cavallo (see WR-96-28). Within days, Cavallo had gone, too.

 Camilion's departure, on the other hand, had been on the cards for many 
months. But Menem insisted he would not sack him unless he was charged with 
wrongdoing in connection with the illegal sale of arms to Ecuador during 
last year's border conflict with Peru.

 That moment came when judge Jorge Urso decided there was enough evidence of 
a cover-up by Camilion to justify requesting the lifting of his ministerial 
immunity.

 The air force commander, Brigadier Juan Paulik, said he warned the defence 
ministry that arms apparently bound for Venezuela were probably being

 off-loaded in Guayaquil en route, but the ministry did nothing. And one of 
the suspects in the case, retired army officer Diego Pallares, has,  
according to Clarin, told judge Urso that he bribed people with political 
connections 'at the highest level' to secure permission for the arms to be 
shipped to Ecuador.

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 ARGENTINA/ Bombing probe. Judge Juan Jose Galeano, investigating the 1994 
bombing of the Amia Jewish community centre, in which 86 people were killed, 
has ordered the arrest of four former policemen suspected of providing the 
explosive device used in the attack. He has also hinted at the existence of 
a cover-up involving the Buenos Aires police force and Carlos Telleldin, the 
only person so far to have been indicted. Judge Galeano, who says he has 
received death threats, claims to have solved 70% of the case.

 Falklands' oil rush. Six international consortia have bid for oil 
exploration licences in waters off the Malvinas/Falkland Islands. The 
bidders include a Lasmo-led consortium; a joint venture between British Gas 
and Argentina's YPF, and a partnership between Dutch Shell Exploration BV 
and Italy's Agip. Bids have been made for 10 of the 19 tranches representing 
an area of 44,000 sq km surrounding the islands. But industry observers have 
pointed out that the bids have been made on the assumption that Argentina 
and the UK will reach a cooperation agreement over the disputed waters.

 Best quality of life. The level of human development in Argentina remains 
the highest in Latin America, according to the latest UN development 
programme report. It ranks the country 30th in the world, closely followed 
by Costa Rica (31st), Uruguay (32nd) and Chile (33rd). The index takes into 
account education, life expectancy, health and other factors considered 
important for 'quality of life'.  

 Flood alert. Environmental protest groups have criticised the plans to 
build the Parana Medio hydroelectric dam, which they say will cause 
flooding, alter the local climate and provide a breeding ground for new 
diseases. The authorities argue that the project will lead to cheaper 
electricity, create 10,000 jobs and improve communications between Santa Fe 
and Parana, as a result of the construction of a new bridge. The plans for 
the dam have been drawn up by Energy Developers International of the US.

 Patents row. Deputies from across the political divide have rejected 
comments made by US ambassador James Cheek roundly condemning the country's 
record on the protection of intellectual property rights. The government 
insists that the new patents law, which was approved four months ago, is in 
line with GATT rerquirements. 

 UK trade up. Exports to the UK reached US Dollars 155.8m between January 
and May, a year-on-year increase of 29%. During the same period imports from 
the UK increased by 13%, to US Dollars 176.1m.

 CHILE/ Coal strike drags on. The 1,800 striking miners at the Lota coal 
mine have for the fourth time rejected the agreement reached between union 
leaders and the government. The miners, who have been out since 17 May, are 
demanding improved compensation for the 450 workers who would be laid off 
under the government's rationalisation plan. 

 Pension funds. The Magister pension administrator is to invest US Dollars 
12m in a similar fund in Mexico, in alliance with Banco Alianza. The move 
anticipates the creation of a private pension system in Mexico on 1 January 
1997. Magister executives say they are attracted by the potential of the 
Mexican system, given the country's workforce of 22m. The company currently 
controls US Dollars 400m, 1.6% of the total held in AFPs.

 Top wines. The country has become the region's biggest wine producer, 
according to experts from the agronomy faculty of the Universidad Catolica, 
participating at the International Wine Fair of the southern hemisphere, 
recently held in Santiago. In 1995 wine exports totalled US Dollars 181.7m 
compared with US Dollars 12.6m in 1986, and the industry is aiming for US 
Dollars 500m by 2000. The main importers of Chilean wine are the US, Canada, 
the UK, and in Latin America, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and Paraguay.

 PARAGUAY/ Rebel without a clause. The legal defence team for former general 
Lino Cesar Oviedo, who is in prison on charges of rebellion, has renewed its 
efforts to secure the release of its client, despite the decision of Judge 
Jorge Borgaran to turn down an earlier appeal. Oviedo's lawyers argue that 
the charge of rebellion can not apply to only one person. 

 Population growth. The fertility rate stands at 4.5 per woman, the highest 
in Latin America, which has an average of 3.2, according to the Centro 
Paraguayo de Estudios de Poblacion. The survey was carried out among 6,472 
women aged 15-49, between October 1995 and February this year. 

 Welfare weaknesses. Access to social security benefits is denied to 81% of 
the 4.1m population, and the proportion of those excluded is rising, 
according to a study by the planning ministry. Around 70% of the system's 
beneficiaries live in or near to Asuncion.

 URUGUAY/ Binational pipeline. Work will begin in November on the gas 
pipeline from the Argentine province of Entre Rios, according to Eduardo 
Ache, president of the state oil company, Ancap. The gas will be piped to 
the coastal cities of Salto, Paysandu, Fray Bentos and Mercedes.

 Overvalued land. Land in the municipality of Colonia is overvalued by as 
much as US Dollars 3bn as a result of the plans to build the bridge over the 
River Plate, according to the transport and public works ministry. The land 
is at present in private hands, and so will have to be bought by the 
government at a high price. Work on the bridge, which will link the city of 
Colonia with Punta Lara in Argentina, is due to begin towards the end of 
next year.

Privatisation can't cure sickness

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. Disputes relating to availability of land for the
State's industrial growth should be solved amicably, the Chief
Minister, Mr Jyoti Basu said here today.

Some agricultural land must be acquired and this would not hurt the
State's agriculture. The State Government had recently set up a
high-power Cabinet committee to expedite decisions on all matters
relating to industrial promotion, he added.

Speaking at the 109th annual general meeting of the Bengal National
Chamber of Commerce, he said privatization was no panacea for sickness
in industries.

"How is it that as many as 450,000 private companies are sick?" Mr
Basu queried in justification of his contention.

He said that West Bengal would soon become the nation's top industrial
State with 10 per cent industrial growth.

Stating that his State now ranked third in the country, after Delhi
and Maharashtra, in terms of attracting foreign investments, the Chief
Minister said since the economic liberalization began in 1991, a total
of 1,239 proposals with an investment of Rs 27.741 crore came to West
Bengal.

Of this, 188 proposals were from the NRIs envisaging a total
investment of Rs 10,712 crore, he said.

He added that his Government was committed to provide time-bound
escort service through the promotional agencies for the speedy
implementation of the industrial and infrastructural projects.

The Chief Minister said that the State Government had recently formed
a committee of the State Cabinet on industry to provide expeditious
decisions on all matters relating to industrial promotion and
development.

The committee, in the past two meetings had reviewed a number of
on-going projects and taken steps to remove bottlenecks in their
execution, he added.

A high-power committee of Secretaries had also been formed in order to
facilitate and monitor industrial as well as infrastructural projects,
the Chief Minister said.

Calling for better research and development he pointed out that the
Centre had allowed about Rs 30 crore for this purpose. Industry houses
need to improve constantly their productivity and quality for survival,
he added.

Pointing out that West Bengal had achieved higher progress in terms of
the State Domestic Product than the national average in recent years,
Mr Basu said such growth in the past three years was the highest for
any comparable period in the past three decades.

Of the proposals received so far, there were 188 NRI/FDI projects with
an investment of Rs 10,712 crore. In the calendar year 1995, 387
approvals were received for a total investment of Rs 10,261 crore which
was 469 per cent more than the corresponding figure for 1994, Mr Basu
said.

The Chief Minister also said that between 1991-95, 214 industrial
units in the State had begun commercial production involving an
investment of Rs 6,728.34 crore.

At present there are 80 industrial projects under construction having
a total investment of Rs 2,240 crore, he added.

Mr Asim Dasgupta, Minister for Finance, West Bengal, said that the
State was aware of the requirement for infrastructure development.
Regarding the tardy progress of the mega-city project, he said the
State was not to blame.

He pointed out that State had contributed more than Rs 104 crore for
two years where it was supposed to give Rs 100 crore. On the other hand
the Centre had given only Rs 34 crore.

The State Government had allocated Rs 1,500 crore for power and road
development in the recent State Budget.

Reacting to the BNCCI's proposal on SSI units, Mr Dasgupta called for
a more "cost-efficient industrialization and employment generation".

He referred to the proposals in the State Budget by which 30,000 small
units would be set up all over the State.

Editorial comment: TRIUMPH OF PUERILITY

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

AS a duck, Bob Dole is looking more lame by the hour; if things
continue in this fashion, he will be a dead one in November. His
campaign is coming apart at the seams. The latest election ploy his
advisers have thought up in their desperation is to ask for the
President's medical records so that the American public is sure they
are not going to vote an HIV positive or a drug addict into the White
House. Have they collectively taken leave of their senses or are they
rehearsing kindergarten games? The idea seems to be to take some of the
attention away from Dole's advancing years and beat Clinton at the
fitness game: Dole is old but healthy, Clinton is young and degenerate.
Questioned about the 21-point lead his rival has established over him,
Dole takes out a letter written to him by his father after he was
wounded in action in the last World War as proof of his tenacity and
ability to survive. That was 50 years ago; today wars are nowhere as
bad for health as presidential campaigns. If this is the quality of the
advice Dole is getting from his campaign managers, he should sack the
lot. All the big ideas have faded into the background, all the small
ones, commensurate with the candidate's historical size, are appearing
from the closet. His campaign is beginning to smell of frustration,
meanness and mediocrity in other words, of failure.

On the other hand, nothing seems to do any lasting damage to Clinton.
The resignation of Morris and the revelations of the whore in question
did not create even a slight dip in his lead, he remains as strong as
ever. The latest survey shows that the incumbent's position is
unassailable: he leads in 33 States in double figures in about 25 of
them with 408 electoral college votes. That would amount to a
landslide. Clinton is surging ahead even in traditional Republican
pockets in the Mid-West, as well as in California and Florida. As a
bonus, Saddam Hussein became a media opportunity at the right time.
Nobody, of course, is talking about platforms, they hardly seem to
matter. It is a war of images, one ghoulish projection pitted against
the other. What is interesting about the campaign is what it portends
for the future. Under Clinton, the commercialization of politics has
made gigantic strides and very soon American Presidents will be
designed, packaged, advertised and sold like toothpaste. Dole, for all
his old-fashioned conservatism, is a willing partner in the game, for,
being the underdog by a long shot, he is even more dependent on
advisers than his rival. Let Americans sort them out as best as they
can. The world knows or perhaps, does not that the era of traditional
partisan politics is drawing to a close. New political realities will
emerge from the global underground whose advance guard is represented
by the likes of Ted Kaczynski,the suspected Unabomber, Iron Mike Tyson,
Shoko Asahara, fundamentalists, cultists and thugs of all descriptions,
Greens, Vegans and the whole jing-bang lot of loonies crawling just
beneath the surface, to bring down the techno-corporate elite.

Voluntary retirement scheme funds for Jute Corp. of India diverted to pay
salaries, wages

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. The funds earmarked for running the voluntary
retirement scheme in the Jute Corporation of India has been diverted to
meet the normal establishment expenditure like salaries and wages of
JCI employees.

The diversion of VRS funds has also held up the Government's plan to
trim the workforce of JCI by 25 per cent through the VRS route.

Documents show that during the last three years JCI received a total
amount of Rs 2.70 crore from the Government towards VRS operation of
which Rs 1.80 crore have already been utilized by JCI for the purpose.

However, due to non-receipt of funds from the Government for providing
the salaries and wages of its employees, JCI resorted to diversion of
VRS funds to the tune of about Rs 1 crore to meet the expenses towards
payment of wages and salaries to its employees for August 1996.

The documents state that JCI had to take this step in order to check
any deterioration of the law and order situation arising out of
non-payment of wages and salaries to its employees.

Of the Rs 1 crore spent from the VRS fund, only Rs 10 lakhs have been
recovered. The Union Finance Ministry has also inquired with the Union
Textile Ministry on how much of VRS funds have been diverted by JCI to
meet its establishment expenditure.

In another extremely significant development, a part of an amount of
Rs 5 crore paid by National Jute Manufacturers Corporation to JCI
towards part settlement of its outstanding dues to the latter, Rs 1.15
crore has been utilized towards giving the salaries and wages of JCI
employees for August 1996.

This shows that the Government has not disbursed any sum to JCI for
payment of wages and salary of its employees.

Moreover, the Union Textile Ministry has directed the JCI management
to utilize the balance amount of Rs 5 crore towards carrying out the
minimum support price operation in case the price of raw jute falls
below the support price level.

The Ministry also made it clear to JCI that the balance amount (Rs
3.35 crore) should not be spent on clearing old arrears. It may be
pointed out that the Reserve Bank of India provides funds to JCI for
carrying out MSP operation.

Thus it is evident that JCI will not receive any fund from RBI for its
MSP operation and will be derived of its legitimate claim. It may be
pointed out that JCI could not undertake MSP operation for the last
three years due to shortage of funds.

NJMC has a total outstanding of Rs 69 crore to JCI of which it has
repaid only Rs 5 crore after much persuasion by the JCI management and
its employees' association. Moreover, the process of repayment has
started after five years.

The documents also show that between 1980-81 and 1994-95 JCI claimed
Rs 277.36 crore from the Government towards subsidy of which it has
received Rs 216.40 crore so far leaving a balance amount of Rs 60.95
crore.

However, the Government is yet to pay the amount to JCI. The
Government till date has also not agreed to provide guarantee to JCI
for obtaining bank loan to procure jute.

Secretary for Textiles holds talks on jute

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. The Union Textiles Secretary, Mr Prabhat Kumar,
today met a delegation of the employees' association of the National
Textile Corporation, Jute Corporation of India and the Jute
Manufactures Development Council, in the city to discuss various issues

The delegation was led by Mr Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, MLA.

The other members of the delegation included Mr D. K. Guha of JCI, Mr
Santosh Mazumdar of NTC and Mr S. K. Basu of the JMDC.

At the meeting Mr Guha urged the Textiles Secretary to provide a
Government guarantee for credit facilities for raw jute buying and
release of Government dues worth Rs 130 crores.

While the NTC representative, Mr Mazumdar asked Mr Kumar to waive
NTC's loan amounting to Rs 550 crores by the Government as has been
proposed by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, Mr
Basu of JMDC observed that the chairman of development and coordination
committee of JMDC be nominated from Calcutta for smooth functioning of
the organization.

Mr Kumar assured them that their respective problems will be looked
into.

Editorial comment: MON DIEU!

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

SUSSEX stealing a march over Champagne? "Unthinkable"impossible" cry
French connoisseurs in sheer agony. And yet a British "champagne" to
rival the classic grandes marques de France has been "created" in a
Sussex village using traditional French methods, says a report in the
Sunday Times of London. How did this sacrilege come about! Well, says
the report, a British couple spent a whole decade trying to perfect the
champagne process and propose to unveil their first bottle of bubbly,
Chardonnay Blanc de Blancs 1992 (how French can you get!), come next
month.

The French will have none of this effervescent nonsense. A British
vineyard emulating a real champagne? impossible, pronounced the French
way, or better still, "faut pas rigoler" (you must be joking!). But the
French are up against a scientific alibi. According to experts,
Europe's climate is shifting, bringing to the south of England the same
climatic conditions that Champagne enjoyed 50 years ago. So much so
that a wine expert who tasted the British brew described it as a tour
de force with a "steely elegance of the real thing". And to think that
the climate does it! So far the more effervescent variety the weather
has been complained of only by the English.

Tea Board eyeing U.S. market

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

By Bala Murali Krishna

NEW YORK, Sept. 16. The Tea Board of India, which has been eyeing the
rapidly growing demand for iced tea in the USA, is chalking out
strategies to enter the market in a big way.

The Tea Board chairman, Mr S.S. Ahuja, who recently completed a
promotional tour of the USA and Canada, said: "We are currently working
on a strategy to enter the sizable iced tea market in the U.S." The Tea
Board's director in New York, Mr S.K. Sinha, said the U.S. market was
growing rapidly and was maintaining a steady growth rate of more than
20 per cent.

Mr Ahuja said that the Board will be collaborating more closely with
the Tea Council of the USA, which it has rejoined as an observer
member. "We have realized the fruitfulness of the association with the
Tea Council," he said. Mr Ahuja said that the U.S. market had undergone
vast changes in the last decade, but India had positioned i brewing of
iced tea.

"Previously India lacked varieties of tea that were fast in colour, so
they were thought unsuitable for iced tea," he said. "But now we have
developed newer varieties of tea (Nilgiri) which are also suitably
priced." Mr Ahuja said the Tea Board was also considering re-joining
the Tea Council of the USA as a full-fledged member. "In the year since
we have been an observer member, we are extremely satisfied with the
efforts made by the Tea Council," he said.

"So we are definitely thinking of a comeback." The Tea Board
relinquished its membership of the Tea Council in 1991, and then
returned as an observer member last year. India is also working closely
with the Council's Specialty Tea Register (STAR), Mr Ahuja said.

"It is our primary market, and it has been our endeavour to satisfy
this market," he added.

He said the STAR was doing appreciable work in promoting specialty
teas, whose demand "is surging, especially in California where
specialty tea bars (like coffee houses) are gaining popularity."
During his visit, Mr Ahuja met Mr Joseph P. Simrany, president of the
Tea Council, and important buyers like Mr John D. Harney of Harney &
Sons.

He is also scheduled to visit Toronto, Hamburg in Germany and London.

Editorial comment: MORE COMPROMISES

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

WHY did Mr Jyoti Basu leave it to his Home (Police) Minister to
complain that the Gorkhaland issue had been unnecessarily revived by
the Prime Minister's announcement on Uttarakhand? After the virtual
revolt by the CPI(M)'s district committee in Darjeeling, the Chief
Minister is uncertain how to deal with Mr Subash Ghisingh. The hill
leader cannot be taken for granted at any time but the resolution
passed by 25 of the 29 CPI(M) district committees supporting the
Uttarakhand idea and, in effect, endorsing the old demand for
Gorkhaland poses a serious challenge. Mr Basu can hardly wish it away
as an "individual opinion" and proceed to impose Alimuddin Street's
will on the Darjeeling committee. Dissidence is a virtue CPI(M) units
have acquired from new-found allies. The crucial question is whether in
the new climate of revived hopes inspired by Mr Deve Gowda, and
endorsed by Mr V. P. Singh, the CPI(M)'s hill committee can remain
outside the mainstream of popular resurgence. Clearly, it cannot if it
has to protect its rapidly eroding base. Whatever little is left of
Marxist discipline or "democratic centralism" is in head-on collision
with the instinct for survival.

The policy of appeasement was meant not only to check separatist
ambitions but also to restore peace to the hills. The Darjeeling Gorkha
Hill Council looked capable of blending the concept of autonomy with
the fulfilment of local aspirations till extraneous ambitions came in
the way and development went by default. Even now it seems possible to
retrieve lost ground if the Central and State Governments can provide
the funds and the GNLF leader is persuaded to fix his priorities. The
Chief Minister makes every sense when he questions whether Nepalese in
the hills have any reason to look for "heavenly" gifts flowing from
Statehood compared to their compatriots in the plains. He might have
added that they have no reason either to continue to repose faith in
leaders who have used the ethnic platform for personal advantage. Now,
with the Prime Minister's announcement giving a fresh lease to
political tensions that had subsided in the last two years, Darjeeling
looks destined to have more splinter groups aspiring to power, more
leaders, more private battles, more militancy, all of which can do the
people no good. It is a pity that Mr Basu now finds his pragmatism
overshadowed by the need to win votes in Uttar Pradesh. He may be
banking on the somewhat nebulous future of the Uttarakhand proposal
itself. But, in the meantime, he will be obliged to deal with
adventurers and opportunists with the added prospect of fresh violence.
He can simply ask the Prime Minister, did he know what he was doing?

Sukh Ram held on arrival in Delhi

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The former Communication Minister, Mr Sukh Ram,
was arrested here tonight soon after he arrived from London at 11.40
p.m.

He was immediately taken into custody by the CBI, armed with
non-bailable arrest warrants issued by a Special CBI Court earlier in
the day.

The former Minister was taken to the All-India Institute of Medical
Sciences shortly after midnight after necessary formalities were
completed at the airport. He left in a white ambulance under heavy
escort through the gate next to the Air-India office and not by the
usual route. Mr Sukh Ram was accompanied by his wife, Mrs Rama Devi.

He was intercepted near the immigration counter and his passport
seized. His son, Mr Anil Sharma, a former Minister in the Himachal
Pradesh Government, was also present at the airport.

Scores of reporters and a battery of lensmen joined CBI officers and
the former Minister's family in their anxious wait for flight A.-I.
112, which landed shortly before midnight. The CBI team was accompanied
by doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and the AIIMS.

Earlier, the Special CBI judge, Mr Ajit Bharihoke, while issuing the
arrest warrants, said, there was "prima facie evidence of Mr Sukh Ram's
involvement in the case and his presence was necessary." The warrants
are returnable on October 1.

The CBI S.P., Mr H.S. Sandhu, in his application said that the former
Union Minister "appears to be deliberately evading the process of law
and was avoiding his arrest by remaining abroad." The agency said fax
messages had been sent to Mr Sukh Ram through the Indian High
Commission in London seeking his presence for the investigation.

The CBI said the accused camping in the residence of his son-in-law,
Dr S.L. Vasisht, in London, appears to be deliberately evading arrest
by remaining abroad.

The agency said Mr Sukh Ram as a public servant in conspiracy with the
Deputy Director (Finance) in the Department of Telecommunications, Ms
Runu Ghosh, misused his official position and caused pecuniary
advantage to Advance Radio Masts Ltd and a loss of about Rs 1.68 crore
to the Government.

The former Minister remained elusive for about a month since the CBI
recovered about Rs 4 crore and other valuables from his residences in
New Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh).

(Money meant for Cong: Earlier, the former Minister said at Heathrow
Airport before departure that the money seized from his houses belonged
to the Congress and was meant for electioneering in Uttar Pradesh.

"The money was given to me by an important party functionary," he
said, adds PTI.) Meanwhile, Delhi High Court today adjourned a petition
filed by Mr Sukh Ram challenging the jurisdiction of the Special CBI
judge to hear the anticipatory bail application.

The Special CBI judge had earlier dismissed a similar petition and had
posted the anticipatory bail application to September 19.

Pattalu Rao surrenders: Mr Pattalu Rama Rao, who heads ARM Ltd, today
surrendered before the Special CBI judge after the tenure of his
interim bail ended. Delhi High Court earlier this month had granted
interim bail to him for his daughter's marriage.

Maqbool Dar "obeys" Election Commission, returns to Delhi

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The Union Minister of State for Home, Mr Maqbool
Dar, today "complied" with the Election Commission's directive to
return to Delhi. He also promised not to return to Kashmir during the
counting of votes. The Commission had issued the directive on Saturday.

Mr Dar today called on the two Election Commissioners Mr M.S. Gill and
Mr G.V.G. Krishnamurthy.

Accompanied by a party General Secretary Mr Prabhat Samantray, Mr Dal
told the Election Commissioners that he had not misused official
machinery and security men for enhancing the prospects of his sons or
other party candidates.

No directive issued by E.C.: The Janata Dal claimed that no directive
had been issued by the Election Commission restricting Mr Dar from
campaigning in the next two phases of polls. It also said Mr Dar will
be leaving for a five-day campaign tour of the State tomorrow.

The party general secretary in a letter to the Commission, pointed out
that Mr Dar has been deputed by the party's central leadership to
supervise the poll campaign in the State. He also said during his tour
of the State, Mr Dar had "abstained from using Government machinery."
The Election Commissioners later said the poll panel was happy with the
Minister's "prompt response". "I am sure others in the Government will
not misuse authority during elections," Mr Krishnamurthy said. "We are
pleased to see that Mr Dar appreciated the stand taken by the
Commission," he added.

Mr Krishnamurthy said the poll panel was not only responsible for
ensuring free and fair elections but also to dispel any misgivings in
the mind of the people.

The Commission had reacted to the Kashmir Government's confirmation
that the Minister was in the State for the last ten days and his party
leaders had been canvassing in his official vehicle.

Following this, a communication was sent to the Home Secretary that
the Minister may be "well advised to come back to Delhi and not be
present during the day of polling and counting," Mr Krishnamurthy said.

During Mr Gill's recent visit to the Valley, political parties,
including the National Conference, had complained about the Mr Dar's
presence in his son's constituencies and the alleged misuse of official
machinery.

Cong denies allegation

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The Congress today claimed that it had never asked
Mr Sukh Ram to collect money on behalf of the party.

It denied that the money recovered from Mr Sukh Ram's residence during
a CBI raid belonged to the party.

The Congress spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadgil, said: "We have never
authorized any Minister to collect money for the party." He said the
AICC treasurer, Mr Sitaram Kesri, had already stated that the money
recovered by the CBI during raids did not belong to the Congress.

Asked to comment on the non-bailable warrant issued against the former
Communications Minister, Mr Gadgil said: "It is not a matter which
requires any comment from us. We have always said let the law take its
own course. And we will cooperate with investigating agencies." On Mr
Sukh Ram's statement that the CBI raids were part of a plot against the
party president, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, the spokesman said, "Only Mr
Sukh Ram can explain what he meant."

BANKS SEEK TO USE FLORIDA AS SHIELD

Draft legislation spurred by the principle of consolidated,
comprehensive supervision has raised a protest from Florida's foreign
bankers, who want the state to protect them from unscrupulous home-country
examiners.
        At issue is a provision being drafted by the Florida Department of
Banking and Finance that would give foreign bank regulators access to the
books and records of foreign bank agencies and representative offices in
the state. The department had hoped to have the measure introduced when the
state legislature convenes in March.
        The language frightened foreign banks, who fear the changes will
enable regulators from abroad to enter a foreign bank in Miami and demand
to see records of individual customers. Attorneys and bankers are writing
alternative language that in effect would require the foreign regulators to
rely on the reports and records collected by state examiners.
        "The question is whether the foreign bank regulator could come in
on a fishing expedition and look at each individual account," said Burton
Landy, general counsel of the Florida International Bankers Association and
an attorney at the Miami law firm of Steel Hector & Davis. "That (practice)
could be subject to abuse."
        Fernando Capablanca, FIBA's president and head of the Extebandes
agency in Miami, said foreign bankers don't dispute the principle that
supervisors and regulators should be able to supervise the activities
worldwide of banks from their country. However, "we don't need to give the
home country regulators any more information than what you give a domestic
regulator."
        Capablanca said one attorney pointed out the problems that could
arise if regulators from a corrupt regime combed the records of a bank in
Miami to see which nationals were rich enough to be shaken down for bribes.
An attorney familiar with the complaints said others pointed out that the
records could be used to find candidates for kidnappings. Other, more
mundane observers noted the records could be used to spot tax evaders.
        Under the language being written by FIBA, home country supervisors
would draw information about foreign banks only by getting reports of
examinations conducted by the state banking department.."It's not an
attempt to limit the supervision or inquiry into the general financial
condition of the bank," Landy said "It's a question of extending it beyond
that point and being able to look at each individual account."
        "We're looking forward to seeing what the industry comes up with,"
said William Douglas Johnson, assistant director of the state banking
department. Florida oversees agencies of 45 banks and rep offices of 21
others, plus a commercial bank owned by a foreign institution. Another 10
foreign bank holdings in the state are federally chartered--one agency, two
commercial banks and seven Edge Act institutions.

SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR RELEASE

Accounting standards-setters in the United States and Canada plan
to follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draft rules
governing when businesses must disclose financial information about their
regional operations and product lines.
        The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usually referred
to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" are slightly less
onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-based International
Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft could require
disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to be issued
by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press for
companies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.
        This difference of opinion has been going for at least a year, and
officials from all three groups are expected to engage in more haggling on
the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposals will be due
June 30.
        Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rule promises to
shed more light on how and where banks make their money. And the rule
became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announced it would
start publishing its group results according to International Accounting
Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hidden reserves
to smooth out balance sheets.
        Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide at least
one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographical lines.
In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internal
financial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.
        The North American approach also starts with the way a business
views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ... recognizes the
fact that this information does not always reflect the dominant source and
nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC's project manager.
"In certain cases, therefore, information needs to be modified for external
reporting purposes."
        The IASC draft recommends segmented reporting whenever a particular
part of the business accounts for at least 10% of total revenue. The North
American approach doesn't contain a threshold, recommending instead that
segments be reported when they are "material."
        Cally Hunt, assistant direct of accounting standards at the
Canadian Institute, told IBR the IASC's position means in effect that an
outside auditor could claim the right to make a company revise the way it
tells the world about its business.
        "That's a tough argument for auditors to win," she said. o

BRIEFS


Norway's Christiania Bank
Closes Seattle Branch
        Norway's Christiania Bank og Kreditcasse is down to just one
banking outpost in the U.S. following the closure of its ill-starred
Seattle branch. An official at Christiania's New York office said the
Seattle branch was shuttered as of Jan. 1, but the Washington State
Department of Financial Institutions said the branch was shuttered last
Sept. 30.
        There wasn't much left by last fall in any case. As of June 1995,
the Seattle operation reported just $1 million in assets, down from $125
million only six months before. Meanwhile, the New York branch's asset size
jumped to $770 million from $225 million.
        Christiania came to Seattle in large part to lend to the West Coast
fishing industry, mainly fishing trawlers. But by late 1993, roughly 86% of
its $300 million worth of loans to this industry were nonperforming, making
the branch one of Christiania's few foreign outposts that significantly
hurt the bank, according to a December 1994 Salomon Brothers report. o
N.J. Starts Anew
On Banking Bill
        A bill that would have let foreign banks put branches in New Jersey
died with the Jan. 9 adjournment of the state legislature. A newly elected
state Assembly was sworn in the next day for a two-year session, and is
expected to tackle the issue again.
        The foreign bank language was part of legislation designed to help
the Garden State conform with the interstate banking bill passed by
Congress in 1994. The measure failed to pass the last legislature mainly
because of fighting between domestic institutions, but there also were
protests against a provision that would let foreign institutions create de
novo branches, agencies and rep offices.
        New Jersey is the only major industrialized state that restricts
non-U.S. banks from having branch and agency offices. This might seem
strange given the presence of National Westminster Bancorp in the state,
but NatWest has only a commercial bank operation in the state. o
N.Y. Fed's E-Markets Chief: No Crackdown
        The New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be strongly
focused on information gathering and policy recommendation-and wasn't
created to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,
the chief of the effort stresses.
        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smack
people in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named to
the new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.
        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge of
international banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDC
expert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDC
debt crisis in the 1980s.
        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure better
economic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing the
majority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in the
wake of the Mexican peso crisis.
        "I think we need to see that the information is as available as
possible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that the
International Monetary Fund "should not be in the business of assembling
information for the private sector," he does think the Fund has an
important role to play in making sure good financial information is
procured from borrowing countries.

Brazil's Banco Excel
Buys Banco Economico
        The fate of Banco Economico's $36 million New York branch clouded
last week in the wake of the announcement that another Brazilian
institution, Banco Excel, had taken over the failed Economico.
        Excel doesn't have a banking operation in the U.S., and to date the
Fed has yet to determine that Brazil meets its standard for comprehensive
and consolidated supervision of institutions. (Brazil has met the standard
needed to qualify a bank to open a rep office in the U.S.)
        This CCS problem likely means that Excel will have to give up
Economico's New York branch. Indeed, when Excel announced on Jan. 6 that it
would acquire Economico, it promised only to maintain services within
Brazil, particularly in Economico's home base in the northeastern state of
Bahia. No operations outside Brazil were mentioned.
        Economico has been under the Central Bank's control since August.
Details on Excel's acquisition were sketchy last week; one report said
Excel's purchase was fueled in part by support from a Swiss bank and from
some Brazilian pension funds. o
Fuji To Restructure
Asset-Backed CP
        Following a downgrading by Standard & Poor's to A-2 at the end of
December, Fuji Bank is working to restructure all of its asset-backed
commercial paper programs, bank officials have confirmed.
        With around $3 billion in CP outstanding, Fuji Bank is the biggest
sponsor of asset-backed programs among the Japanese banks. It also
participates in a number of CP programs as a liquidity provider, which
means that many other conduit sponsors will have to find a replacement or
"front" bank for Fuji with ratings of A-1 or A-1+.
        The downgrading is also expected to affect the bank's  credit
enhancement  business because some activities will become more expensive.
For example, the rating agencies require that cash collateral loans be kept
on deposit at institutions rated at least A-1/P-1, and a bank with an A-2
rating would have to fund this enhancement in the secondary market at A-2
rates.
        Fuji has not yet decided how it will restructure its five CP
programs, officials said earlier this month. Recently, Sakura Bank, which
was also downgraded to A-2, restructured its CP programs by hiring
Norinchukin Bank to act as the primary enhancement and liquidity bank in
front of Sakura. Fuji is considering such an arrangement among other
options, officials said.
        The bank's fully supported programs, Dynamic Funding Corp. A and B
and Progress Funding Corp. A and B, were already downgraded to A-2 along
with the bank. Its partially supported program, Freedom Asset Funding,
faces downgrading within a month or so if it is not restructured.

California Awaits Word
On Which Regs To Cut
        California's State Banking Department expects to get word from the
governor's office later this month on which regs it can try to repeal.
        Deputy Superintendent Walt Mix said several regulations affecting
foreign banks are part of package proposed to Gov. Pete Wilson, but Mix
declined to identify them. He said some proposals would require legislative
approval, while other repeals would have to go through under the state's
administrative procedures act. That latter process takes several months,
while legislative action is a much more iffy proposition, given the
turbulence in Sacramento over the past several years. o
N.Y. State Lets Banesto
Sell Extebank Unit
        New York State Banking Superintendent Neil Levin announced Jan. 11
that the state banking board has approved the acquisition of Extebank by
North Fork Bancoporation from Banco Exterior de Espa a.
        Extebank had $959 million in assets as of last June. The

institution. Its international operations have been transferred to Banco
Exterior's recently opened New York branch. o
IDB Chief To Reveal
Bank's Plans for Miami
        Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank,
will be the guest speaker Jan. 18 at a luncheon sponsored by the Summit of
the Americas Council. He'll talk about Greater Miami's role in the IDB's
future plans. For information, call (305) 539-3079. o
Costello Moves Up,
But Not Out
        Suzanna J. Costello can't say when she's going to leave town.
        Costello was promoted as of Jan. 1 to vice president, international
banking supervision and regulation, at the Atlanta Fed. As such, she's
supposed to move to Atlanta from Miami, where she currently is branch
assistant vice president. But Costello told IBR on Jan. 11 that she hasn't
set a date for moving to Georgia, and in fact hasn't even started looking
for a home.
        "Whether I'm down here or up there, I still have to be in two
places," she said, noting that the majority of the Atlanta Fed region's
foreign banks are in Miami.

OFFSHORE SHELL UNITS GET STUNG AGAIN

Regulators are finding it increasingly easy to justify entertaining
the notion of barring foreign banks' offshore shell branches. The most
recent evidence arrived last week, when the U.S. Customs Service said it
had arrested two vice presidents of Banco Portugues do Atlantico on charges
of using an offshore unit to launder funds from its New York branch.
        An offshore facility also figured in the Daiwa Bank scandal,
prompting the state of New York's chief foreign banking regulator to note
last month that "momentum is building again" among regulators to limit or
eliminate offshore shell branches that are managed or controlled by onshore
offices of foreign banks.
        Assets at those offshore shell branches totaled $317.87 billion as
of Sept. 30, Federal Reserve figures show. While that's down 6.6% from the
$340.38 billion in the branches as of mid-year, it still is roughly equal
to one-third of all the assets at foreign banks' U.S. branches, agencies
and commercial banking subsidiaries. Roughly half that decline during the
third quarter stems from a $12.47 billion slump in claims on U.S.-domiciled
offices of related depository institutions.
        In the Banco Portugues case, revealed Jan. 11, the Customs Service
said that between August 1994 and the present, Antonio Delgado and Fillipo
Valli received in New York more than $1 million from undercover agents that
were handled as deposits in the Cayman Islands. BPA has a branch in the
Caymans.
        "The defendants were told and were aware of the fact that the
various deposits they received from the undercover agents were proceeds of
the illegal importation and sale of counterfeit jeans from the Far East,
and from illegal gambling," the Customs Service said.
        "The undercover 'depositor' was assured that his account would be
maintained offshore in order to protect the client and the nature of his
business, and that no records of the deposits would exist in the United
States. In addition ... the undercover agent was offered investment schemes
to hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service."
        Valli was arraigned Jan. 5, while Delgado will be arraigned this
week. If convicted on all charges, each could be sentenced to 20 years
imprisonment.
        Banco Portugues' New York branch occupies prestigious territory at
the corner of Wall Street and Broadway. It had $447 million in assets as of
last June 30. Banco Portugues also has an $81 million agency in Miami.
        In the Daiwa scandal, offshore branches figured in when it was
learned that the bank's New York trust company lost $97 million in
government bond trading during the mid-1980s--losses concealed by
transferring the bonds to a shell company registered in the Caymans.
        At a Dec. 4 conference in New York on foreign banks, Donald T.
Vangel, senior vice president of the New York Fed, said a committee of bank
policy supervisors is debating what to do about the unusual facilities.
"It's a knotty question," he said. "... If I were king for a day, I'd like
to see them disappear."

FLORIDA NEWS BRIEFS


AFTER BASCOM: Comptroller Robert Milligan could receive by this weekend a
list of five or so names of people nominated to replace Wilbert Bascom as
chief of the state's Office of International Banking. Officials have been
conducting interviews with about 15 people in Chicago, New York, Boston and
Atlanta for the job. Bascom resigned in July to join First Equity
Securities, an investment banking firm owned by Jamaica's Eagle Merchant
Bank.
PANAMA DEAL: The Florida International Bankers Association may decide this
month whether to set up a closer relationship with Panama's bank group.
FIBA President Fernando Capablanca said Panama is interested in more formal
links because many of the events affecting banks in Panama emanate from the
U.S. At the same time, many foreign banks in Florida care about  Panama.
The cooperation agreement would be fairly loose and not involve any
expenditures.
DREAMING IN CUBAN: The Cuban Banking Study Group will culminate three years
of research on Feb. 8 with the presentation of a book called Cuba: Past,
Present and Future of its Banking and Financial System. The book in essence
is a game plan to modernize the nation's financial and banking system
whenever the communist country decides to develop a market-oriented
economy. Among the topics addressed: requirements for a consortium of
private banks during a transition period, the need for a commercial code
and for a Cuban Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and proposed entry
criteria for foreign banks to operate in Cuba. The book costs $15. For
information, call (305) 284-6868.

ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF INVENTIONS

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

The annual exhibition of inventions in Taiwan has always been a
good place to find newly-developed products that haven't yet
appeared in the market-place. This year was no exception.

The 1996 show attracted more than 100,000 people to the exhibition
hall in Taipei's domestic airport from August 22-25. The show moved
to Taichung from August 29-September 1, and closed in Kaohsiung
from September 5-8.

"Many Taiwan inventors are small entrepreneurs that don't know how
to cross the bridge to international markets from the home or
office," said Johnson Huang, an engineer with Gwo Yann Enterprise
Co., and recipient of the China International Invention Award.

"The show tries to match buyers and sellers of products, and
particularly aims to help inventors to get their ideas in to the
market," he said.

The flavor is local as the show guide is in Chinese, and over each
product table is a poster with a photo of the inventor and the
product, a product description, and contact information. The text
is in Chinese, however, and international traders that don't read
or speak Chinese may need a translator.

Many of the products shown have been patented but not yet launched
locally or overseas.

Taichung inventor, Long Yu-chen was showing a model of a
lightweight plastic shaft with a clamp on the bottom that can be
used to pick up shoes.

"It's very useful for pregnant women that find bending over
uncomfortable," she said. It's also suitable for obese individuals
that have trouble bending down, she said.

Mr. Long, who was at the exhibition in search of agents that would
export the product, was taking orders for the product at NT$150
each.

Other inventors present had already launched products in Taiwan and
were looking to expand their overseas channels.

Liou Tian-an, for example, displayed shoes that contain air vents
that allow odors to escape. "I hope to eventually cooperate with
Nike on this," he claimed. Mr. Liou, vice president of Liou Tian An
Trade Co., said that he got the idea from an interest in massage
products, and in search of a way to reduce sweat and odor in his
own shoes.

Machinery products were also displayed. You Lian Machinery Co.
displayed a powered grease applicator. It applies grease quickly
without air compression. It has already been successfully sold in
Taiwan, said W.H. Liu, a sales manager.

Sheng Wu Fu Co. displayed an "autocraft power maximizer," which the
company says boosts mileage by 15 percent in urban driving, by
reducing waste connected to air conditioner use.

Chai Thou Industrial Corp. displayed automatic car cigarette
lighters with music. The product can be plugged into cigarette
lighters in cars. Customers insert the cigarette head and it is lit
automatically.

ISO 14000: CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS, COMPANIES URGED TO JOIN PILOT SCHEME

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

Singapore companies can reap considerable benefits by adopting
environmental controls under the ISO 14000 Environmental Management
System (EMS) standards.

The benefits include:

  Improved operational efficiency;

  Better utilization of materials and resources;

  Reduced costs and wastage;

  Increased access to world markets;

  Improved staff morale and working environment;

  Assurance to customers, stake-holders and regulators;

  Enhanced corporate image.

These benefits would be reflected in companies' "bottom lines,"
said the Minister for Trade and Industry, Yeo Cheow Tong, at the
launch of the Productivity and Standards Board's (PSB) ISO 14000
EMS Certification Scheme.

Mr. Yeo cited as an example an MNC in Singapore, which saved nearly
US$1.5 million a year by recycling its packaging materials.

Urging local companies to join the certification scheme, Mr. Yeo
added: "Apart from material benefits, companies can also gain
goodwill with the community and their customers. Being seen as a
respectable corporate citizen enhances a company's image."

Mr. Yeo announced that the government would provide financial
assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for ISO
14000 consultancy and certification.

Grants to cover 70 percent of consultancy costs (up to a maximum of
US$40,000) and for 50 percent (maximum US$6,000) of certification
costs will be funded through the PSB's Local Enterprise Technical
Assistance Scheme (LETAS).

"Singapore has always been conscious of maintaining a `clean and
green' environment," said Mr. Yeo. "From the early days of
industrialization, the government has been mindful of the need to
protect Singapore's minimal natural resources and ensure that
industry is not developed at the expense of the environment."

He said that with the setup of the Ministry of the Environment in
1972, Singapore became one of the first countries in the world to
create a ministry specifically for environmental protection.

"Our sustained efforts at government, corporate and individual
levels have earned Singapore international recognition as a `clean
and green city' but we cannot be complacent," said Mr. Yeo.

"A growing population and continued economic and industrial
development will impose further demands on our fragile
environment," he said.

Mr. Yeo urged Singapore companies to seriously consider the
adoption of ISO 14000 in view of the many benefits that can be
gained.

Meanwhile, to help Singapore companies to adopt ISO 14000, the PSB
has started a pilot certification program open to all companies
until the end of this year.

So far, seven companies from the manufacturing and service sectors
have joined the pilot program. They will receive feedback on their
EMS implementation, and will undergo trial assessment at no cost
before formal certification by the PSB.

"I would urge more companies to join the pilot program," said Dr.
Steve Lai, PSB general manager for Standards and Technology, when
the PSB ISO 14000 EMS Certification Scheme was launched on May 28.

The objective of the pilot program is to provide a partnership
arrangement between Singapore-based companies and the PSB to ensure
smooth implementation of ISO 14000, he said.

The launch, which was organized jointly by the PSB and the
Singapore Confederation of Industries (SCI), and supported by the
Ministry of the Environment (ENV), was followed by a seminar in
which experts in environmental management and certification from
Japan, the United Kingdom and Singapore shared their experiences
with local industry leaders and executives.

The seminar speakers included Mr. Kimihiro Torisaki, director of
planning and coordination, Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) for
Quality System Registration, Japan; Mr. Clive Mason, deputy
director of the Regional Institute of Environmental Technology
(RIET); and Dr. Glen Sunman, director of Asian business, Aspects
International, U.K.

The local speakers were Mr. One Seng Eng, chief engineer (strategic
planning), Ministry of the Environment; Mr. Wu Tek Ming, director,
Quality Assessment Centre, PSB; and Mr. Jay Rajangam, senior
environmental engineer, Baxter Healthcare Pte Ltd.

Companies can call the PSB's customer service toll free hotline at
1800-7751167 for more information on the pilot program and
certification scheme.

U.S. MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN NEW IDEAS

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY MOIRA NIELD

After realizing that being number one in the machine tool industry
is no longer the easy job it used to be, U.S. manufacturers have
faced up to their competition. Companies like Ingersoll Milling
Machine Co. based in Rockford, IL, were showing off their technical
innovations to the 120,000 visitors of IMTS '96. Its newest
product, the HVM 600, a grinding machine used in the automobile and
aircraft industries, is powered by linear motors. Linear motors are
faster than traditional rotary motors and don't need the bearings,
worm screws and gear boxes that rotary motors require. It is all
magnetic.

U.S. companies are coming up with innovative ideas that are moving
the machine tool industry forward. The average machinist today is a
computer expert and a math wizard. Skilled tool and parts makers
are hard to find in today's job force. Virtually all the machinery
at the IMTS show is computerized and automated. That is the future
of the business.

Most forecasters expected the machine tool market to be off last
year's strong pace, but the Association for Manufacturing
Technology is quite enthusiastic about the first half of 1996.
Orders for U.S. industrial tools rose 18.74 percent in June from
the previous month to reach 2.9 million. Orders dropped slightly in
July down to 2.7 million. The outlook for the rest of the year
continues to show a bright picture, especially for exports.

U.S. machine tool companies realize they have to keep up the good
work and innovative technology to keep up with the competition.

TAIWAN MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES EXCEL AT IMTS '96

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY DAN ANDERSON

Chicago, Illinois  This year's International Machine Tools Show
(IMTS) brought together another diverse and impressive group of
exhibitors from Taiwan. Taiwan companies continue to show why they
are leading players in the machine tools industry with their wide-
range of quality products at competitive prices. The products on
display included: machinery parts and components, ball screws,
grinding machines, milling machines, electric discharge machines
(EDM),  lathes, and machining centers. It is important to note that
almost all of these machines are of the highest CNC control-type.

With these Taiwan manufacturers increasing their penetration into
the European and U.S. markets it is important that they meet the
stringent standards in place, and this is where Taiwan companies
have greatly increased their overall standing. Over 70 percent of
the Taiwan companies exhibiting at this year's show hold ISO 9000
certification or the new European CE standard. These increased
quality standards combined with Taiwan companies' innovation and
entrepreneurial abilities may provide the best answers as to why
Taiwan companies are expected to increase their market share over
the next few years.

Awea Machantronic Co., Ltd. is a perfect example of a Taiwan
company using indigenous Taiwan technology to successfully compete
with the strong competitors from Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and
the United States. Awea has taken technology that was first
developed at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a
Taiwan government sponsored technology institute, and incorporated
this technology into their Double Column Machining Centers. This
product is competitively priced and Awea has already sold over 20
of these machines during the first half of this year. It is also
utilizing a marketing outreach program by advertising in most of
the major machine tool trade publications in order to further
promote the company and its products.

Another strong example comes from Corisma Machine Tool Co., Ltd.
Corisma has only been in business for six years but has already
developed a strong foothold in the machine tools market utilizing
its high technology expertise. The company is a three time winner
of Taiwan's Symbol of Excellence (1993, 1995, 1996) and this year
it was awarded the prize of Outstanding Enterprise in Taiwan.
During this year's IMTS, Corisma is finding positive responses to
its newly developed CNC Wire-Cut EDM. According to a Corisma
representative, it was the first maker in Taiwan of such a product
with almost all of their competitors coming from either Japan or
Switzerland. Though competition is well-based, the company still
expressed optimism that because of its stringent quality standards
(it has CE qualification) and competitive pricing, it will enjoy a
positive penetration into this market segment.

Another area where Taiwan companies are looking to excel is the
development of strategic partnerships. By utilizing Taiwan's
relatively low production costs but still maintaining high-quality
standards, Taiwan companies are increasingly looking to develop
alliances with their Japanese, European and U.S. competitors,
providing both sides with a more competitive product.

For instance, Leadwell CNC Machines Mfg., Corp., a leading Taiwan
machine tools company, has developed, in conjunction with the U.S.
company Wes-tech, Inc., an automatic CNC lathe using robotic gantry
technology. Leadwell is very optimistic about this new product and
has expressed a positive opinion towards its partnership with Wes-
tech. They think it is a good way to utilize each company's
individual strengths to develop a better product. In yet another
example, Yeong Chine Machinery Industrial Company, a maker of
machining centers, CNC lathes, and milling machines, is working
with both Japanese and German companies to sell new machinery to
the global market. By developing alliances they feel confident that
their competitiveness can only get better.

As Taiwan companies continue to achieve better quality and stronger
marketing ties they can expect a better position in the global
machine tools market.

BIG BICYCLE MAKERS SUFFER LOSS IN SALES

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

Several of Taiwan's listed leading bicycle manufacturers suffered
declines in sales in August this year, with some plummeting more
than 20 percent, according to Economic Daily News report.

Giant Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Taiwan's biggest bicycle maker,
netted more than US$15 million in August, a drop of 23.36 percent
compared with the same month of last year. The accumulated revenues
in the Jan.-August period stood at US$118 million, a reduction of
24.68 percent compared with the corresponding period a year
earlier.

The second largest bicycle manufacturer, Merida Industry Co., Ltd.,
suffered a reduction of 22.66 percent in August sales to reach US$9
million. In the first eight months of the year, Merida's sales
decreased 25.39 percent to reach US$59 million.

The two bicycle giants attributed the sales reduction to less
orders this year from the U.S. due to inventory kept from last
year.

KAOHSIUNG LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EXPAND ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE (I)

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

This article is reprinted from the Free China Review. The second
part will be continued in the same column next week.

"You'll find us rough," Pegotty told David Copperfiield, "but
you'll find us ready." Pegotty might have been a Kaohsiung man.
Students of city polarity will recognize the scenario at once.
Paris and Marseilles regularly trade insults. London scoffs at
Liverpool and gets as good as it gives. And New York looks down on
everyone. In the blue corner, a bunch of effete, white-wine-
imbibing nincompoops wearing silly, overpriced clothes who pretend
to run things while messing them up. In the red corner, beer-
swilling urban peasants good only for making steel, or whatever it
is that they make these days in those nasty, smelly factories. On
the one hand, Taipei, Taiwan's center of commerce and culture. On
the other, Kaohsiung, the island's second largest city, an
industrialized behemoth on the southwestern coast that belches
forth smoke, has more container ships than you can shake a stick
at, generates money twenty-four hours a day, and is home to 1.4
million citizens who are not afraid to call a spade a spade.

People who study this power-house for long enough sometimes come to
the conclusion that Kaohsiung may be the island's second city but
it ought to be the first. The industries located within its 153
square kilometers contribute as much to Taiwan's prosperity as
Taipei. It enjoys clear, sunny weather on an average of 270 days a
year, as opposed to about 180 in Taipei. It has mountains, the sea,
great seafood, cheaper rents and real estate, and better traffic
conditions than Taipei. Question: Why, then, do so few people want
to live and work there?

The answers are complex. For all its merits, Kaohsiung still has
serious problems: a lack of cultural facilities, a standard of
living well below Taipei's, and the worst pollution on the island.
"It's not pleasant having your living room invaded by some noxious
chemical stench while you're trying to enjoy a quiet evening at
home," says Chang Tiao, an architect who has lived in Kaohsiung for
eighteen years. Another resident, Wu Chiu-hui, shudders as she
talks about the tap water. "After you boil it you're left with this
white, foamy scum on the inside of the pot," she says. "I don't
know anybody who dares drink the stuff. We all use filters or drink
mineral water." Local burghers hope to make Kaohsiung into an
international city, and with luck and a lot of hard work it might
one day eclipse Taipei as Taiwan's business hub. But, absent some
fairly dramatic changes in living conditions, the odds are that
those who make these dreams come true will want to commute from
afar.

Kaohsiung is one of Taiwan's oldest cities, and its development has
always been inextricably linked to the sea. In the mid-seventeenth
century, fishermen from the mainland recognized the harbor's
potential as a fishing port, offering an ideal shelter from storms,
and began to settle there. During their respective rules over
Taiwan, both the Dutch (1624-1662), and the Japanese (1895-1945),
understood Kaohsiung's potential as a fishing center and fostered
its growth. Today, it is the hub of Taiwan's deep-sea fishing
industry and its fleet brings in more than half the island's annual
catch.

Kaohsiung Harbor is also an ideal deep-water port. Because Taiwan
lacks natural resources, heavy industries that rely on imported raw
materials have tended to establish themselves in Kaohsiung. Chinese
Petroleum set up a refinery there in 1946, and China Steel and
China Shipbuilding both came in the 1970s.

Export processing zones

Export industries also took advantage of the harbor. The Japanese
had developed the city as an export center for Taiwan's sugar
industry, and in the 1960s two export processing zones were set up
to help send goods made in Taiwan to world markets.

This industrial city was not born by chance. It was the policy of
the Japanese colonial government to develop commerce in northern
Taiwan and industry in the south, a policy that was maintained
after Taiwan's return to Chinese control. And it was a policy that
paid off: Kaohsiung's industries fueled Taiwan's transformation
from an island of fishing and farming villages to the world's
third largest container shipping port.

But whether discussing the city with residents or pounding its
wide, relatively uncluttered streets, the visitor always comes back
to pollution. It is a problem that goes well beyond mere
inconvenience. Kaohsiung's pollution positively discourages white-
collar professionals from moving to the city, while driving out
some who are there already. As a result, Kaohsiung has never been
able to develop the kind of service industry base that has helped
Taipei become the island's wealthiest city. Hence Kaohsiung's
reputation as a city populated primarily by blue-collar workers
whose career opportunities are limited to industries such as
shipping, fishing, steel, and petrochemicals.

When Chang Tiao was interviewing architects for a company he used
to work for, he found that very few of them were willing to move to
Kaohsiung. "Young people always opted for Taipei first, then
Taichung or Tainan," he says. "Many Kaohsiung natives wouldn't work
here if they had the choice." The result is a Catch-22: a shortage
of white-collar jobs means a shortage of white-collar
professionals, which discourages service industries from setting up
in Kaohsiung, leading in turn to a shortage of white-collar jobs.
"If we're going to attract the people we need to develop this city,
we have to improve its living environment," Chang Tiao says.
"Cleaning up pollution must be our first priority."

Human nature being what it is, people want to know who to blame for
Kaohsiung's ills. Government is invariably the first to be
fingered. When the R.O.C. took control of Taiwan in 1945. Kaohsiung
was administered from Taipei by the Taiwan High Commissioner's
Office. In 1947, it became a provincial municipality under the
jurisdiction of the provincial government, and in 1979 it was
designated a special municipality, like Taipei. But that didn't do
much for the place. Some people even believe it hindered the city's
development. Architect Chang Tiao explains that, unlike provincial
municipalities whose mayors were popularly elected, mayors for
special municipalities were appointed by the central government, a
practice that ended only in 1994. "The less they did, the less
chance they had of making mistakes, and the brighter their
political future," he says. "So no mayor tried to develop the
city."

But many Kaohsiung residents, including Wu Den-yih, its present,
popularly elected mayor, say it's not fair to put all the blame on
previous city administrations. Central government policies that
focus on the development of northern Taiwan at the expense of the
south are equally guilty. Mayor Wu talks about Taipei as Taiwan's
brain, and Kaohsiung as the island's heart. The brain gives the
orders, but the heart keeps the blood flowing. Since they are of
equal importance, therefore, the central government should treat
them as such. But according to Mayor Wu, while the central
government has taken good care of the brain, it has neglected
Taiwan's heart. He points out that the annual budget allocation
from the central government to Kaohsiung is only a third of
Taipei's.

City officials and residents agree that Kaohsiung has suffered
grievously from this arrangement, particularly in the development
of its infrastructure, service industries, educational system, and
standard of living. "Since there are only two special
municipalities in Taiwan, most people take it for granted that
Taipei is number one and Kaohsiung is number two," Chang Tiao says.
"In terms of population, Kaohsiung is indeed Taiwan's second
largest city, but in terms of family income and standard of public
education, Kaohsiung barely makes the to five."

Y.S. MAGNET CORP.: YEARLY EXPORTS REACH NEARLY US$3 MILLION

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY JOHN LINEHAN

Y.S Magnet Corp. manufactures a range of magnetic novelty items for
the home and office such as memo holders, pen boxes, phone books,
erasable memo boards and  miniature calendars.

The company's newest product is the mini-calendar which costs about
US$0.40. It comes with a refrigerator magnet attachment and the
backing is made from PVC. Each page has space to make notes for
that day, and contains a proverb or old saying. It is available in
a variety of styles, all of which are created to suit customer
requirements.

The company also produces a range of pocket sized  100mm X 85mm
address books. The pages fold out accordion style and the magnetic
covers hold them together when not in use. The most basic cover
design is made up of a background color and single basic color
logo, whereas that of the advertising or business style is more
detailed, depending on customers design. These styles usually
feature some local scenery or specialty, product or service
advertisement. The promotional style logo is designed to promote
the customer's company image and the creative style, for commercial
use allows the customer total freedom in logo design. Common themes
are Christmas, 4th of July etc.

Yearly exports are valued at about US$2.9 million of which the
United States accounts for 40 percent. A further 30 percent goes to
Europe, and 20 percent to Japan. Southeast Asia and Taiwan account
for the remainder of sales.

All production is in the company's two Taipei factories and OEM,
which at the moment accounts for small part of production, is
welcome.

Production largely utilizes screen printing methods and monthly
production capacity is in the order of 600,000 pieces per month.
Minimum order is generally around 20,000 pieces per item. Delivery
time is 30 days and samples are available from the company free of

COMPANY INTRODUCING NEW AUTOPARTS, ACCESSORIES YEARLY

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY SEAN GRIFFIN

When the 30 employee strong Outie Company, Ltd. of Changhua began
as a manufacturer and distributor of auto mirrors in 1993, company
officials had no idea that the company would grow so large, so
fast.

Today, less than three years later, the company is producing more
than 300 types of car parts and accessories, and has earned a
reputation as a company to be reckoned with in this incredibly
competitive business. With plans to introduce nearly a dozen items
yearly, the company's current IDFR brand accessories range from key
chains and car body decorations to mirrors, fog lights, mufflers
and reflectors.

Utilizing PVC, stainless steel, aluminum and woven carbon fiber
combined with chrome, gold, wooden and assorted finishes, Outie
Company is able to produce a host of quality items for its
customers.

The company's latest products include a cigarette lighter adapter
which allows for three sockets to be created from one plug. The
company's walnut-grain veneer manufacturing technology  imported
from Japan  gives this product a unique finish. A newly designed
lightweight car rack has also recently been introduced to the
company's roster of products, as have a variety of finely finished
car interior accessories.

While Taiwan accounts for about 50 percent of the company's current
market, the Middle East and the U.S. are the focus of the company's
export sales and stand at about 30 and 20 percent respectively.

Outie plans to continue introducing new and innovative car
accessories in the future and hopes to expand sales into larger
markets such as Europe and South America. Outie is currently
looking for agents worldwide.

Samples are available from the company upon request. Regular orders
are available within one month and a minimum order of one container
is required.

FANG & FANG INDUSTRY CO., LTD.: FROM GIFTS TO AUTO PARTS, LOCAL FIRM COVERS
IT ALL

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996


BY SEAN GRIFFIN

Starting out specializing in the import and export of hand tools,
the Taichung-based Fang & Fang Industry Company has grown over the
past 25 years to expand operations into six divisions, representing
hundreds of products for a wide range of industries.

Working with nearly 300 Taiwan-based factories, Fang & Fang has
expanded its operations to cover not only hand tools, but also
plumbing supplies, sporting goods, bicycles and bicycle parts,
giftware, and a host of auto parts and accessories.

Among the hand tools available from the firm are socket sets,
wrenches, screwdrivers, and power tools, as well as heavier
equipment such as bench grinders and hydraulic jacks. Giftware
includes ceramic containers, polyresin figurines, ceramic
containers, musical clocks, and music boxes, while plumbing
supplies include faucets, valves, shower heads, and nozzles. And
everything from wiper blades to car mats is available from the
firm's auto accessories division.

Already holding dozens of patents for its finished products, Fang &
Fang is also eager to work in OEM manufacturing.

When asked how the company is able to compete while representing
such a vast array of products, general manager Charles Found
pointed to the extraordinary relationship the company has with its
customers and associates.

"We have been in this business for 25 years, so we know which
factories are producing high quality products and we know we can
depend on them. Because of this special relationship with our
factories, we are able to provide the best products at the best
prices for our customers."

Mr. found added that his company takes pride in building strong,
long-lasting relationships with its customers, and visits all of
its customers twice yearly in order to head off any problems that
may arise.

According to Mr. Found, Fang & Fang grosses US$210 million a year
on average.

With its market covering the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Japan at 50,
20, 20 and 10 percent respectively, Fang & Fang is looking to
expand its sales in Japan, Eastern Europe, and Central America.

ISUZU ENTERS VIETNAM

    Isuzu has received a license to establish an auto assembly plant in 
Ho Chi Minh City. Isuzu of Japan becomes the 11th automaker to enter 
Vietnam; a market with a modest demand for automobiles is already 
crowded with Auto Assembly Joint Ventures. Vietnam bought about 
5,000 cars last year.
    The Joint Venture is a cooperation between two Japanese 
firms -- Itochu Corp. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. -- and two Vietnamese 
firms -- Saigon Motors Company (Samco) and the Import/Export 
Trading Company in Govap district, Ho Chi Minh City.
    The $US 50 million Joint Venture, of which the Japanese side has 
70% interest, Vietnam 30%, will build light trucks and buses from 
imported kits.
    While Japan's automakers are adding more auto Joint Ventures, 
Volkswagen of Germany has recently postponed its decision to establish 
an auto assembly plant in Vietnam. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have 
already formed car Joint Ventures in the country along with other major 
names in auto industry from Japan, South Korea and the U.S.

SANYO PLANS TO PRODUCE WASHERS

    Sanyo of Japan is planing to produce fully automatic washing 
machines for Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) and the Indochina 
market (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia).
    The Joint Venture, Sanyo Home Appliances Vietnam Corp., includes: 
Sanyo holding 70% interest, Sanyo Electric Trading  20%, and 
Sumitomo Corp. 10%.
    Sanyo plans to invest $US 24-30 million to manufacture 200,000 
washers per year by 1997, mostly for consumers in Vietnam.
    The Venture also aims to raise the production level to more than 
500,000 units per year by the year 2000 for Indochina countries and 
Myanmar.
    The washing machines factory will be located in Bien Hoa, some 40 
Km (25 miles) north east of Ho Chi Minh City.
    Brand name Sanyo was well-known in Vietnam for its TVs in the 60's 
and 70's. Sanyo gas cookers have been used by the Vietnamese for the 
past few years.

BANKING UPDATE

    The World Bank has approved a $US 49 million loan for Vietnam to 
upgrade its banking services. The purpose is to help Vietnam reform its 
Inter-banking Payment and Clearance services as well as customer 
services.
    Since October 1993, the World Bank has loaned Vietnam $US 788 
million, including this $US 49 million new loan.
    Beneficiaries from the banking reform project include Vietnam's State 
Bank (VSB), Bank for Foreign Trade (Vietcombank), Bank for 
Commerce and Industry, Bank for Investment and Development, Bank 
for Agriculture, Eximbank and Maritime Bank.
    Before 1988, almost all banking activities in Vietnam were controlled 
by VSB. VSB is now charged with regulating the country's money 
supply and preserving the value of the national currency, and the 
majority of commercial banking transactions are assigned to other 
state-owned banks. 
    By and large, most Vietnamese do not see banking institution as a 
safe place to put their hard-earned savings. Partly due to what happened 
in 1975 when the communist regime has begun to exert control over the 
entire nation. The regime naturalized all private businesses and 
individual bank accounts, including foreign-owned enterprises. These 
assets, with a small number of exceptions, later became government 
assets. 
    Since then the majority of Vietnamese preferred to keep their savings 
to themselves, usually in gold, US dollars or both.
    Many Vietnamese prefer a community loan system called hui, from 
which a member could get a loan without any officially written 
contracts. This type of loan is solely based on trusts among group 
members.
    This system of loan is far from providing any security for its 
members. Although not on a regular basis, defaults have happened but 
hui tradition continues despite loan defaults. 
    Another common way to raise money for investment is to borrow 
from friends and relatives. Both the personal  and hui-type loans usually 
have higher interest than Vietnamese banks could offer.
    Although the interest rates for saving accounts in Vietnam are rather 
high compared to those of western nations, the percentage of personal 
banking deposits as compared with personal assets is remarkably low. To 
date, Vietnam has less than 40,000 personal accounts. The government 
of Vietnam needs to do more than just banking modernization to 
persuade its people putting their savings in banks or similar financial 
institutions.
    In order to spur economic growth, following the recent interest rate 
cut from Vietcombank, Bank for Commerce and Industry and Bank for 
Agriculture have slashed their interest rates .
    For its customers in the service and commercial sectors, Vietcombank 
now offers a new annual rate of 22.8%, a reduction of 2.4%. For the 
Production sector, the annual rate is cut to 19.2% from 21.6%.
    Bank for Commerce and Industry now charges an annual rate of 
19.2% instead of 20.4% for its customers in the production sector.
    Bank for Agriculture in Ho Chi Minh City offers different rates for 
private enterprises and state-owned businesses. For private production 
enterprises, the annual lending rate now is 28.8%. For state-owned 
businesses, the current rate is 20.4%. 
    While lowering the lending rates for businesses, the government is 
planing to raise interest rates to attract more individual depositors.

companies have won the bids from the Vietnam's Ministry of 
Transportation to overhaul various sections of National Highway 1 -- the

Tho sections -- with a total length of 865 Km.
    These six companies were chosen from more than 50 international

Transportation. They are: You One Anam and Construction Corp. No 8, 
Keangnam and Construction Corp. No 4, Singsung and  Construction 
Corp. No 5.
    The contract for the 150 Km Ho Chi Minh City-Can Tho section was

CANADA GIVES VIETNAM MFN STATUS

    Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet made his first 4-day visit 
to Vietnam in November 1995 and was welcomed by Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
Mr. Ouellet signed an agreement with Vietnamese Trade Minister Le 
Van Triet to grant MFN (Most Favored Nation) status to Vietnam.
    Canada will provide a $US 15 million aid package aiming to improve 
Vietnam's economic reforms and help Vietnam to better manage its 
environment and natural resources. The money will be used in three 
major projects: the Environmental Management, the Financial 
Management and the Language Training projects.
    Canada resumed its Official Development Assistance (ODA) Program 
to Vietnam in 1990, and since then, under ODA program, Canada has 
contributed about $US 40 million.
    Trade between Canada and Vietnam was at a humble figure of around 
$US 42 million in 1994. In term of investment in Vietnam, Canada is 
currently ranked 22nd with $US 52 million, behind China and ahead of 
Germany.
     Canada has recently elevated its trade office in Ho Chi Minh City 
to the level of Consulate General headed by Mr. Ian Burney.
    Although Canada investment in Vietnam is modest, Nortel of Canada, 
a telecommunications company, has made its mark in the Vietnam 
Telecommunications sector. Nortel was selected to install a 3,000 Km 
fiber-optic Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) system that runs 
between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (a distance of 1710 Km). Vietnam 
Post and Telecommunications also contracted Nortel to install a Digital 
Switching System DMS-100 for the port city of Hai Phong. Hai Phong 
is about 103 Km (65 miles) from Hanoi on National Highway 5. 
    Even though the U.S. and Vietnam have normalized diplomatic 
relationships in July 1995, trade normalization has not been fully 
realized until Vietnam receives MFN status from the US. There have 
been talks between the two countries, but no time is set for the U.S. 
to grant Vietnam MFN status.

THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS INSURANCE COMMISSION

    (Industry Review) Insurance is still a fairly new concept to an 
average Vietnamese, even though Vietnamese press has repeatedly attempted 
to promote it. The Vietnamese generally understand that motor vehicle 
insurance is necessary, realizing the danger of being bankrupted or being 
drawn into a court battle when a fatal accident occurs.
    However, regarding Life Insurance, their thinking is different. The 
idea of paying money and expecting family members can collect a large 
sum should one die is still new and skeptically received among the 
Vietnamese. Even though making a final financial arrangement is 
obviously necessary, speaking beforehand of one's death is viewed as 
superstitiously bad luck.
    The Vietnamese would rather buy house, land, jewelry and gold and 
leave these assets to their loved ones. Like in other developed Asian 
nations, this view may be changed once they are getting more familiar 
with insurance concept.
    In an effort to exert control over the Insurance sector, the Ministry 
of Finance issued Circular 76 TC/TCNH dated 25 October 1995 to regulate 
Insurance commission. Only agents who are licensed to work in the 
insurance business are allowed to collect commissions.
    The commission rate for personal property is the lowest (0.3%) and 
the rate for Life or Health Insurance is among the highest (10%). 
Insurance commission is based on the value of the insurance policy.
    Before 1993, the only insurance company operating in Vietnam was 
state-owned Vietnam Insurance Company (Bao Viet). Although this 
sector is no longer one-company industry, the government still wants a 
tight control in this business and is not ready to open up to foreign 
companies.
    Currently, foreign companies are not allowed to have 100% 
ownership of the venture, therefore they must operate through local 
firms acting as their agents.
    Major portion of local insurance firms' revenues is their commissions 
earned from second tier "re-insurance" rather than direct premiums paid 
by customers.
    At present, there are five non-Life insurance companies in Vietnam. 
Three state-owned insurance companies -- Bao Viet, Bao Minh and 
Vinare (National Re-insurance Company) -- are well-known in Vietnam.
    More than 20 foreign insurance companies from countries such as 
France, England, Switzerland, South Korea and Taiwan have opened 
representative offices in Vietnam.
     One of the leading insurance companies in Europe, Zurich Insurance 
Group of Switzerland, has recently opened an office in Ho Chi Minh 
City to promote Life, non-Life, and re-insurance. Also LG Insurance 
Company of South Korea has opened  an office in Hanoi. Both Zurich 
Insurance and LG Insurance will cooperate with Bao Viet and Bao Minh 
insurance firms.
    Vietnam's Ministry of Finance has asked Yasuda Fire and Marine 
Insurance Company of Japan to provide insurance training for 
Vietnamese officials in 1996.
     On one hand, the government knows insurance business is lucrative 
and wants to put state-owned local insurance companies in a controlling 
position. On the other, they realize that the country lacks capital and 
desperately needs foreign investments. 
    The government is facing a dilemma and they have to find ways to 
overcome it if they ever want to efficiently develop this industry.

AIRLINES PASSENGERS INCREASE 30 PERCENT

    By the end of 1995, Vietnam Airlines, a state-owned enterprise, has 
transported more than two million passengers, of which 40% were 
international and 60% were domestic. This is an increase of 30% over 
the 1994 passenger volume. Also about 30,000 tons of cargo were 
transported in 1995. 
    As the demand is expected to grow, Vietnam Air lines forecasts an 
increase to about 5 million passengers and 110,000 tons of cargo by the 
end of this century.
    Vietnam Airlines is making improvement after a major restructuring 
more than two years ago. Recently, Vietnam Airlines has signed an 
agreement to lease two ATR-72 from Aircraft International Rental of 
France; this will bring the total ATR-72 operating in Vietnam to 6 
airplanes. These planes are used for short distance flights between 
Vietnam's cities.
    Besides Soviet made aircraft, Vietnam is also using Airbus and some 
older version of Boeing planes. The government is seeking to eventually 
replace all of its aging fleet of Soviet made aircraft with planes from 
Airbus and Boeing.
    Due to their modest budget, Vietnam needs to have more Vietnamese 
pilots who could fly modern jets. Vietnamese pilots' salary is much 
lower than that of foreign pilots. Vietnam pays foreign pilots on the 
average around $US 10,000 per month while the Vietnamese 
counterparts may earn only about $US 3,000 per month. 
    Aiming to increase the number of Vietnamese pilots by the year 2000, 
Vietnam has sent its bright young men to Australia for a three-year pilot 
training program.
    In a joined-marketing effort to boost sale, Vietnam Airlines and other 
ASEAN's airlines: Brunei Airlines, Garuda Indonesia Airlines, 
Malaysian Airlines, Philippines Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Thai 
Intl. Airways have recently offered their passengers a 15% discount. 
Vietnam has become a member of the ASEAN (Association of South 
East Asian Nations) since July 1995.
    Vietnam's second Airlines, Pacific Airlines, operates mainly in three 
largest cities of Vietnam -- Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang and 
Hanoi -- and between Vietnam and Taiwan as well.
    Pacific Airlines suffered a considerable loss of  as much as $US 
200,000 a month in 1994, prompting the Vietnam Civil Aviation 
Administration (VCAA) to reorganize its management team. The new 
team includes Mr. Duong Cao Thai Nguyen as Managing Director and 
Mr. Luong The Phuc as chairman of the Management Board. Mr. Phuc 
is currently Deputy General Director of Vietnam Air Lines.

GETTING TO KNOW THE VIETNAMESE 

    The Vietnamese are basically a very polite, hospitable and sensitive 
people. With 4000 years of civilization, they are proud people who like 
to recite to a myth that they are descendants of an angel and a dragon.
    Their manner is casual, friendly and they take pride in their 
hospitality. Not only are the Vietnamese deeply attached to their 
families, they also view friendship as a very important aspect in life, so 
important that in Vietnam, there is a saying " far away relatives are not 
as important as nearby neighbors." 
    Personal and business matters could be confined among close friends 
since friendship is not only necessary for their emotional supports but 
also for mutual assistance.
    Their homes are always open to friends.  No appointments are 
necessary for casual visits to their homes and visitors are usually 
received warmly. However, it is best to let them know or phone them in 
advance if it is a business visit. 
    If you happen to be in their homes at meal time, they will probably 
invite you to sit down and share whatever food is available. They may 
not hesitate to offer you the best portions as a sincere gesture of 
hospitality and close friendship. Let them know that you enjoy their food 
is one way in successfully building a better relationship with them. 
    When they invite you to their homes for a meal, celebration, or 
special occasion, some gifts -- usually food, fruits, chocolate or liquors 
(especially American and French liquors are favorite) -- should be 
offered to the host's family. 
    Although the Vietnamese may be happy to accept your offer, he 
usually refuse the first time or even the second time, for fear that he 
might be regarded as greedy if he accepts your offer the first time. He 
may claim that he already has or does not need it. It is recommended 
that you have the patience to repeat the offer once more. 
    Patience is one of the keys in successfully dealing with the 
Vietnamese.
    On the other hand, when they offer you gift, they will usually speak 
lightly about it. Even though it is an expensive gift, they may pretend it 
is of no great monetary value, since boasting is often criticized
    Having a few drinks in a social gathering is widely acceptable. Like 
many other parts of the world, Vietnam does not sanction heavy 
drinking. Alcoholism is often kept hidden since it is viewed as a social 
disgrace to the family. 
    Alcohol drinking is now increasing among men and drunkenness in 
public does occasionally happen.However, the Vietnamese, at present, 
do not view this as a social problem because alcohol consumption level 
per capita in Vietnam is still one of the lowest in the world -- average 
about 5 liters per person.
    The majority of Vietnamese women never drink and it is not unusual 
if they decline when alcoholic beverages are offered to them. Drinking 
problem are rare among women. 
    While smoking is considered the norm among men, even young men; 
very few women smoke. Women's smoking in public is seen as tackiness 
and those smoking women are often regarded as " liberal".

VIETNAM: MID-AUTUMN FESTIVAL

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Thu Hanh

There were few domestic toys for sale for the Mid-Autumn Festival
this year. This is a common comment of shoppers during their buying
sprees for children prior to their festival that fell on the 15th
of August of the lunar calendar (Sept.27,1996).

Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival is a tradition in Vietnam.
Although it is a children's festival, it is a common concern of
society, because on this day children in almost every family must
have a tray full of "banh nuong" (pies) and "banh deo" (sticky rice
cakes), a grapefruit, a bunch of bananas, persimmons, "com"
(steamed young rice dyed green), and toys such as paper lion heads,
small drums, star-shaped lanterns, or turning lanterns with a shade
decorated with paper cut figures.,to celebrate the Mid-Autumn
Festival.

A couple of weeks before the festival, the toys shops along Luong
Van Can, Hang Ma and Cha Ca streets and in front of Lenin, Thu Le
and Bach Thao parks were already stocked different kinds of paper
masks, lanterns, dolls and electronic toys. In general, the toys
were attractive looking and selling at cheaper prices than last
year. For instance, a small lantern made in China cost 9,000-12,000
VND, and a bigger battery-operated musical lantern cost
17,000-30,000 VND. A turning lantern sold for 20,000-30,000 VND.
During the pre-festival days, even the poorest parents tried to buy
some toys they could afford for their children. A mask, a
star-shaped lantern, or a small drum cost only 1,500-5,000 VND.
Well-to-do families preferred modern toys, each of which might cost
from several hundred thousand to even several million VND.

Hanoi's wholesalers sold toys to traders from the outlying
districts of Dong Anh, Soc Son and Thanh Tri, Ha Dong town in Ha
Tay province, and Ha Bac, Hai Hung and Nam Ha provinces. However,
except for paper masks, lanterns and drums, not many toys were made
in Vietnam. Currently, there are only a few toy-making enterprises
in Hanoi such as the Phuc Hung Plastics Company and the Dai Kim
enterprise. But these enterprises only produce toys for the
education programs of kindergartens, and they cannot compete with
Chinese and Thai toy-makers in terms of quality, designs and
prices. Furthermore, these Chinese and Thai products have often
been smuggled without tariffs and, naturally, are sold at cheaper
prices. So far, stuffed animals made by the Hung Sang and Binh Tien
companies have won the trust of customers for their high quality
and diversified designs, but their prices are still high for most
customers. For instance, a little Mickey bear costs 7,000 VND, and
a bigger one costs as much as 250,000 VND.

On the occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the confectioneries,
state-owned or private, produced about 200 tons of pies and sticky
rice cakes with different fillings: green beans, salted eggs,
Chinese sausage, roast chicken and vegetarian. A box of 4 pies or
sticky rice cakes costs between 20,000 and 80,000 VND. The prices
this year were higher than last year because of a 10-20% increase
in prices of ingredients. The Thuy Ta restaurant by the side of
Hoan Kiem Lake and the Bodega Foods and Drinks Company were the
main suppliers of pies and cakes; each produced about 50 tons. In
addition, Xuan Dinh village in Tay Ho district with 60 years of
experience supplied 80 tons of pies and cakes. Among the most well
known non-state confectioneries supplying pies and cakes for the
Mid-Autumn Festival are the Bao Ngoc, Huong Nam and Duy Tan shops.
However, some unlicensed private shops produced poor quality pies
and cakes causing a feeling of uncertainty among customers.

VIETNAM: NGUYEN TU NGHIEM, THE CULMINATION OF AN ARTISTIC CAREER

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Pham Thi Tuyet

Nguyen Tu Nghiem, one of the seven prominent painters in the
generation trained during the war against the French colonialists,
received the Ho Chi Minh Award on his 75th birthday. He is one of
the three living painters in his generation to receive this prize
instituted by the Vietnamese Government in 1985 to  honour the
writers, artists and scientific workers who have best contributed
to national liberation and construction.

The old artist was sitting in his small garden  absorbed in
memories as we arrived in  his small flat at the government-leased
TrungTu apartment building.His young wife was preparing dinner.

"It's a real pity, a real pity, " he repeated as he took us around
the small room hung  with recent paintings which serves as his
exhibition room. He said that almost all his paintings made during
the  anti-French war have been lost. He estimated it was
approximately one hundred paintings.He recalled with a deep sigh of
regret and a lowered head the loss of hundreds of paintings done by
himself and Bui Xuan Phai,  his alter ego and another winner of
this Ho Chi Minh Award. The two were preparing an art exhibit when
French troops parachuted on the resistance base  in the northern
jungle and destroyed or took away all the sketches and canvasses
they had completed during the first years of the war.

One thing that intrigued me right after scanning  the scores of
paintings in his room is the predominance of paintings about
"Kieu",  the main character in a novel the same name. Each painting
was executed differently on a different material. Explained the old
artist:"It is like the haunting of all my life. I made a clay
figurine of Kieu when I was only a six-year-old  kid in my native
village in Nghe An province and started to paint its face as best
as I could imagine from the story related by my father. Although
the story of Kieu originated in China, the Kieu created by Nguyen
Tu Nghiem's brush, is always every inch a Vietnamese girl, a
Vietnamese beauty. Another favourite theme of his is the mythical
Giong, the child hero who defeated the aggressors and saved the
kingdom after being transformed into a giant with a fire breathing
horse from a heavenly messenger. Nguyen Tu Nghiem also has done
painstaking research into the regional folk dances which he
reconstructed so well that some critics called them the most
perfect collection of folk dances of Vietnam. He distinguishes
himself by the original way he executes his lacquer paintings. A
famous case depicts the " Guard of the Temple of Literature" (in
Hanoi). The whole picture is painted in white lacquer but with
varying thicknesses of paint which create different nuances and
shades. The same can be found in his painting titled "The  Gate of
Mong PhuVillage during Harvest Time". This work is so evocative
that one admirer exclaimed:" It makes me feel as if I could hear
the croaking of the frogs in the painting."

Nguyen Tu Nghiem is one of eight painters and sculptors receiving
the Ho Chi Minh award this time. Five received the award
posthumously.

VIETNAM: THE HANOI FINE ARTS SCHOOL, ONE OF THE OLDEST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Nguyen Luong Tieu Bach
Associate Professor, Director of the Hanoi Fine Arts School

The Hanoi Fine Arts School is rightly described as the"cradle of
Vietnam's modern arts." Founded in 1925 by the French as the "
Ecole des Beaux Arts de l'Indochine," it was the first formal art
school in  Vietnam. Prior to this, Vietnam as well as Laos and
Cambodia had no institutions for formally training painters and
sculptors. There were only small groups of artisans who learnt
their techniques from their parents and grandparents and perfected
them through extensive work in handicraft workshops. In this sense,
the modern arts taught at the Fine Arts School of Indochina were
divorced from the artistic traditions of the nation. Art students
were given classes chiefly in the European, more particularly the
French classic arts. But this deviation was soon discovered by the
first crop of Vietnamese students who, coincidentally, were to
become also the most prominent artists of modern times. Such names
as To Ngoc Van, Nguyen Phan Chanh, Tran Van Can and Nguyen Gia Tri
are icons in the pantheon of Vietnamese modern painting.
Increasingly, this first generation of graduates and their
successors realized the crucial need of using their art in the
service of the people; this tendency was displayed through the
resistance against the French war of reconquest (1946-1954).
Teachers and students, sometimes without even an easel, packed
their minimum indispensable working tools in a rucksack and went to
the front to record scenes of battles or the combatants in the
hours between battles, or the seemingly endless throngs of men and
women transporting supplies to the front. In the twenty-year fight
to liberate South Vietnam, the Hanoi Arts School had more
opportunity to concentrate on large scale training. After the
reunification of the country in 1975, training was no longer
limited to Hanoi. Now there are also art schools in Hue (Central
Vietnam) and Ho Chi Minh City. This has enabled the Hanoi school to
raise its  standard and  concentrate on university-level tranining
and, eventually, post-graduates training in painting and sculpture.

The opening up to the world has also opened broad vistas for the
Hanoi Arts College to increase its exchanges with artists in
countries in the region and across the world. More and more
painting exhibitions have opened in the country and abroad. Higher
sales of paintings are not only bringing higher material benefit to
the artists but also have raised the profile of Vietnamese arts in
the eyes of local and foreign art lovers.

The improved living standards in the country have also expanded the
market for art and motivated artists to make consistent efforts to
improve themselves. Outdated models, styles and genres can no
longer capture the vast horizon of present day life. Artists,
mostly  from the younger generation, venture out  into their
changing environments in search of new modes,  materials, and
styles of expression.

Many graduates of the school have won prizes abroad. For example,
Nguyen Thu now at the exhibition of realist painting in Bulgaria,
and Dinh Trong Khang in the international art expo in the former
Czechoslovakia. 95% of the  awards  at  annual art exhibitions
inside the country are won by artists trained by the Hanoi school.

VIETNAM: MARIJUANA ADDICTION SPREADS TO ALARMING PROPORTIONS AMONG SCHOOL
CHILDREN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By  Lan Huong

Recently the press has sounded the alarm about the spread of
marijuana addiction among schoolchildren, and educators have raised
their voice about the need to stop this social vice.

In HCMC marijuana has found its way through the school gates in
hand-rolled cigarettes while in Hanoi schoolchildren buy heroin,
burn it on a piece of tin foil, and inhale it as a way of
relaxation. According to a report by the Interior Ministry,
students began to smoke opium in 1993 and the addiction has been
spreading ever since. In Hanoi over the past year, nearly 80 school
children and college students were caught in the act of using
marijuana. This figure, of course, reflects only a small percentage
of the actual users, but it reveals an alarming social phenomenon.
Many schoolchildren lacking the money to buy marijuana have joined
gangs riding high-powered motorbikes to rob people. A report from
the Hoan Kiem police precinct (Hanoi) said police had captured a
gang of 8 young robbers who admitted to having committed 50
robberies in a period of one and a half months.

Who then are the suppliers of marijuana to schoolchildren and
college students? Tracking down marijuana rings has revealed the
availability of these toxic drugs at tea shops located near
university and college campuses. These tea shop owners eager for
profits have sold marijuana to students, even though they are well
aware that selling marijuana may bring them from 5 years to life
imprisonment and even the death penalty. In one case, an entire
family consisting of 11 members from grandparents to grandchildren
was engaged in drug trafficking. Since the Government issued a
decree on strengthening the fight against smuggling and drug
trafficking, smugglers and drug traffickers have adopted more
cunning methods of operation to evade the police.

Speaking of drug addiction among schoolchildren, Ms. Nguyen Thi
Hung Cuong, Vice-Chairwoman of the People's Committee of Quang Ninh
province, said the province has sounded the alarm about drug
addiction among schoolchildren. Quang Ninh province has taken
measures to prevent addiction by making the commitment between the
schools and families to strengthen the management of
schoolchildren, build walls around schools, increase school
patrols, and remove tea shops located near schools.

Mr. Nguyen Minh Chanh, Vice-Director of the HCMC Labour, War
Invalids and Social Affairs Service, said cigarette peddlers have
sold marijuana to schoolchildren and students in hand-rolled
cigarettes. When they get addicted, they have turned to
pickpocketing to get money for drugs.

Mr. Tran Xuan Nhi, Vice-Minister of Education and Training, said
the education service should do all it can to prevent the spread of
drug addiction among schoolchildren and students. The service has
introduced anti-marijuana lessons in the school curriculum at all
levels. It has given special attention to such lessons at the
schools in mountain eous areas to help prevent the cultivation of
the opium poppy there.

The coordination of anti-marijuana efforts among the police and
customs services, the schools, and the families is essential to
help curb the spread of a social vice that is affecting
schoolchildren and students now.

VIETNAM: REFORM OF STATE ENTERPRISES CONTINUES

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Doan Huong Lan

The reform in the organisation and operation of the State economic
enterprises has resulted in a dramatic reduction of State-owned
enterprises from 6,300 entities in 1990 to 516.

Meanwhile, the combined liquidity of the State-run enterprises rose
3.5 times or an annual increase of 30.1% and output value rose
11.3% on a yearly average. Its gross profit almost quadrupled to
7,100 billion VND between 1990 and 1994. Meanwhile losses dropped
from 503 billion VND to 300 billion VND.

State-run enterprises are still predominant in key industries such
as energy generation, chemistry, iron casting and food processing,
which over the past 5 years have recorded an annual growth of 20%,
20,1%, 16.1%, and 13.6% respectively. However, small and
medium-scaled business with old and obsolete equipment still
account for a large proportion in the State economic sector. Thirty
five per cent of all State-owned enterprises are employing less
than 100 workers each and 50% have a legal capital of less than 3
billion VND (270,000 USD).

Shortage of capital remains as acute as ever. Liquidity can meet
only 60% of the demand, which is estimated at 20 billion VND,
excluding the cost of capital construction and upgrading of
equipment.

Only 20% of the value of the industrial products of the State-owned
enterprises have been exported.

VIETNAM: ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN A VICE

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Ha Linh

The more than 100 Vietnamese enterprises in electronics are finding
themselves in a vice: If they want to survive the harsh competition
from such world giants as Sony, Matsushita, Philips, Samsung and
Technics, they have to accept working as subcontractors for them in
joint ventures in which their share is always very far from giving
them a significant say. But if they choose to stay on their own,
chances are high that they will meet their foretold death earlier
than they think.

In both cases, chances for Vietnamese to develop an electronics
industry of their own are very slim, if any at all.

The quick fix backfires

To be fair, it is the foreign electronic companies which have
helped the local electronics industry to get to where it is today.
In the late 70s and early 80s, Vietnamese enterprises were allowed
to import semi-knocked-down parts to assemble TVs and radio
cassettes and many of them indeed made a fortune out of it.

The policy proved to be an important quick fix, for the country was
then faced with a dire shortage of consumer electronics goods.
Consumers had to import TV and radio cassettes on their own,
further straining the country's scarce reserve of hard currencies.

The arrival of foreign electronics manufacturers on the market and
the emergence of joint ventures provided a strong stimulation for
local manufacturers to strive more. But problems soon cropped up,
one after another. The foreign companies which used to sell
components to Vietnamese assemblers no longer do so if the latter
are not their joint-venture partners. But once the Vietnamese are
in the joint ventures just to keep their production alive, they
lose their autonomy in production because they never have the
necessary capital to hold a controlling share in the ventures. And
all this happened on the same market that the Vietnamese used to
have the last say. Moreover, most joint ventures only sell their
products in Vietnam, just as Vietnamese assemblers did in the past.

One of the pioneer assemblers of electronics goods in Vietnam,
Viettronics Tan Binh, is finding itself at a loss in this dilemma.
For years, it had been making a good buck assembling and selling
Sony and JVC TVs. But as soon as Sony officially entered the
Vietnamese market, it had no choice but joining the Sony-controlled
venture if it wants to retain the privilege of assembling Sony
TV's. Tan Binh was harder pressed for there were many other smaller
Vietnamese assemblers were waiting on the sideline for a chance to
take its place. Experts predicted that when JVC comes in, it is
likely that Tan Binh will have to set up a similar joint venture
with it as well.

Problems

It would be no problem if the joint venture brings more benefits to
the local company and promises it a stronger future development. In
reality, benefits from the joint venture have come to only those
sections of the local company which work for the joint venture. The
rest suffer real losses because their market is already taken away
by the joint venture's products. Viettronics Thu Duc, an assembler
of the same calibre as Viettronics Tan Binh, is an example. Its
joint venture with Matsushita to assemble Panasonic TV has
benefited only the sections which work for the venture. The rest of
the enterprises now has enough work for only four days a week.

Economists see more problems than that. They said that in joining
ventures with world electronics giants, Vietnamese manufacturers
are losing at least two opportunities for their own development.

First, they said, as foreign companies come, many Vietnamese
assemblers have already set up modern assembly lines which are not
any inferior to those brought in by the foreigners. Now, that they
are already part of the joint ventures, Vietnamese tend not to make
sizable reinvestments in keeping their technological edge. Further,
the Government's slowness in taking action to protect local
industries has discouraged them from attempting to keep this edge.
The result is a virtual hand-over of the playground to the foreign
companies.

The second lost opportunity is their miss in grabbing the market of
telecommunications products as this industry is fast expanding in
the past couple of years. Experts said that if Vietnamese had been
quick enough, they could have easily taken control of this market
which has now become almost a open ground for foreign suppliers.

The sole solution

Recently, as the Hanoi Electronics Company (Hanel) announced that
next year, it will market the first Hanel TV sets with at least 60%
local content, the news was received with mixed feelings. Many
other Vietnamese electronics companies may have also thought of
producing something of their own, but doubts about the
competitiveness of their products against those made by
foreign-invested joint ventures discouraged them from going any
farther. There are also doubts that any local banks would be
willing to finance such local ventures.

"As for now," commented an industry expert, "the only choice for
Vietnamese electronics manufacturers seems to join a
foreign-invested venture. But this virtually amounts to an
on-the-spot export of labour in which they will sell their skilled
labour for a living and a marginal benefit."

This expert also said that the only solution to the problem rests
with the local manufacturers themselves. "They need to fend for
themselves, and in the process, they need the Government to provide
them with the necessary protection through appropriate policies and
financial support.

THE LABOUR MARKET IN VIETNAM: MR TRAN DINH HOAN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Thanh Tai

Labour and the labour market are both an urgent, permanent question
in Vietnam. Vuong Thanh Tai, a VNC correspondent, has just
interviewed Mr Tran Dinh Hoan, associate professor,Ph.D candidate,
Minister of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, on this issue.

VNC: What do you have to say, Minister, about labour and the labour
market in Vietnam?

TDH: Vietnam has a population of 75 million of whom population of
37 million of working age. Each year, 1.15-1.2 million more people
come of working age.

The rural areas make up 76% of the total workforce and the urban
areas, 24%. The urban areas have a 6.1% unemployment while 30%, and
in some places even 40-50%, of the rural workforce is partially
unemployed. The state-owned sector employs about 3 million workers
who account for 8.5% of the total work force.

Since Vietnam began the renewal process, the labour force in the
state-owned sector has been reduced considerably as a result of the
re-organisation of production. Simultaneously the labour force in
the foreign-invested and private sectors has rapidly increased
thanks to the encouragement of foreign investment in the developing
multi-sector economy. The demand for labour has fluctuated greatly
as the supply-demand process, in each sector of the economy affects
the wages offered as well as the number and skills of needed
workers.

VNC: Is there any contradiction between the availability of labour
and the demand for labour as required by the industrialisation and
modernisation processes?

TDH: The most noticeable contradiction can be seen in the supply
and demand of skilled workers. Currently, Vietnam has more than 4
million trained workers, just 10.7% of the total workforce,
distributed primarily in urban centres, in the state-owned sector.
As the cause of industrialisation and modernisation demands a large
contingent of skilled workers, the Party and the State have
encouraged diverse forms of job-training. The 8th National Party
Congress in its Resolution called for increasing the skilled
workforce to 22-25% of the total labour force by the year 2000. It
is also necessary to adjust the current training structure which
has a ratio of 1-1.6-3.6 for university graduates, high school
graduates and skilled workers, respectively. The ratio in developed
countries is 1-4-10 respectively.

As the foreign-invested sector is developing vigorously, the demand
for skilled high-tech workers will also grow rapidly. Therefore,
the system of training centres must  combine formal class room
training with on-the-job training and access to the latest in
high-tech equipment meet this specific demand.

VNC: What is the solution to unemployment and a more efficient use
of intellectual workers?

TDH: With a  market economy, unemployment is common in developed or
developing countries. Since Vietnam began to shift over to the
market mechanism, there have been signs of unemployment. For
instance, a population census conducted in 1989 showed an
unemployment rate of 4%. This rate grew to 9% in the first years of
the 1991-1995 plan. A labour and employment survey in urban areas
in 1994 pointed to an unemployment rate of 6.1% in urban areas and
7% in major towns. Currently, the jobless in Vietnam are estimated
at 2.5-3 million people.

Over recent years, the State has issued policies encouraging job
creation. The best results were obtained in 1995 when jobs were
created for more than 1 million persons, equal to the number of
persons  coming of working age each year. The Ministry of Labour,
War Invalids and Social Affairs has, together with the other
ministries and branches concerned, built a national job generation
program and is elaborating an insurance system for the unemployed
to submit for Government approval.

On the other hand, the solution to a more efficient use of
intellectual workers focuses on 5 causes of the irrational use of
intellectual workers. First, there must be a plan to adapt training
to the demand of employment. Second, a labour market must be
created to help intellectual workers find suitable employment in
their profession. Third, a policy must be issued encouraging
intellectual workers to work in those areas which have a great
demand for them. Fourth, a suitable wage scale must be developed
for those intellectual workers working in a field outside their
profession. And fifth, those intellectual workers in the
state-owned sector who have been made redundant by the
administrative reforms and the re-organisation of production must
be re-employed in other branches.

VNC: What comment do you have on the labour market in
foreign-invested enterprises? on the strikes by workers and the
maltreatment of workers by foreign employers?

TDH: Foreign investment is a strategic factor helping to accelerate
the renewal of the economic structure, the industrialisation of the
economy, and the generation of employment. That's why, over recent
years  the labour market in this sector has developed vigorously
and now employs more than 85,000 workers. This sector is demanding
more and more skilled workers in industrial production. The demand
for labour by foreign-invested projects in agriculture, forestry
and fisheries is growing continually because  the cost of
generating employment  in these branches is lower than in
industrial production.

During the 1991-1995 period, the demand for labour by
foreign-invested enterprises gradually shifted from the South to
the North and the Centre. Because this sector pays higher wages for
qualified skilled labour. About 70-80% of the workers in this
sector are skilled labour,About 90% of the labour force employed by
this sector are urban workers.

Of the 214 strikes since 1989, 79 have been in state-owned
enterprises, 93 in foreign invested enterprises, and 42 in private
enterprises. During the same period, there have been 32 cases of
maltreatment of workers, including 18 cases in enterprises invested
by ROK employers. These cases have all been settled by the agencies
concerned by means of warnings, imposing fines, forcing
compensation for the economic damage, deportation, and even legal
prosecution.

To ensure a good relationship between workers and employers, to
prevent strikes and to stop maltreatment of workers, it is
necessary to set reconciliation councils, arbitration councils, and
labour courts. For the time being, each province and city must set
up a working group composed of representatives of the branches
relating to labour employment, help to form trade union
organisations, improve the efficiency of labour inspection
organisations, and control implementation of the Labour Law.

VIETNAM: FIRST ALL-WOMEN ART EXHIBITION

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Hoang Yen

They are three women who share the same ambition to make powerful
representations of their artist visions on the canvasses. Thus, a
group exhibition of 70 of their favourite paintings was opened at
a Giang Vo Street gallery in Hanoi.

In fact, none of them is a professional artist. Le Minh Ha works at
Vietnam Airlines, Vo Thanh Huong at the Archaeology Institute, and
Nguyen Hong Hanh at the Oil and Gas Corporation. Something that
stands out as one enters the gallery is the variety of subjects
that have come under the optical as well as visionary perceptions
of the three artists whose well-travelled records are beyond
dispute.Another common denominator is their training at the same
Hanoi College of Industrial Arts. But the similarities end there.
Vo Thanh Huong tends toward a forceful realism which catches her
subjects in their most natural, deepest   self-expression: "
Farewell", "Streets", Still Life," and "Palm Trees" are  some of
the best  illustrations.

Nguyen Hong Hanh is more pensive and romantic in her paintings
"Young Women Returning from the Market", "Boats on the Red River,"
Dusk on Tam Bac River" and "Peacock Displays Its Plumage". On the
other hand, Le Minh Ha  prefers stronger colours in her paintings
of "Sundown on the Suburban Village", "Street on the Seashore",
"Bluebell Flowers".

A tentative attempt to venture into the strange waters of
surrealism can be detected in the "The Mark of Time" by Le Minh Ha
who seems to arrange things and feelings according to her
perceptions of time and space. For Nguyen Hong Hanh, space becomes
more unreal, more introspective in  Spring Comes over Dien
Bien".Occasionally, Vo Thanh Huong departed from her mainstream
style and  reverted  to tradition by making black the dominant hue
on her canvasses.

VIETNAM: ORIGINALITY AMONG PAINTERS OF THE YOUNG GENERATION

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Hoang Yen

As the market economy has opened new outlets for all kinds of arts,
originality has become a distinctive mark for which all painters,
especially those of the young generation, are aspiring and striving
for. How these young painters are trying to establish their
hallmarks, in other words, to carve a name among the multitude of
artistic displays, is approached by VIETNAM COURIER'S HOANG YEN, in
her recent interviews with a cross section of painters.

Doan Van Nguyen, 49,  lecturer at the Hanoi Arts College whose
specialization is lacquer painting. Nguyen has had several of his
works displayed at the Vietnam Arts Museum and the Oriental Arts
Museum in Russia:

"Originality and popularity must go side by side and in most cases
must mingle. Lacquer painting is not unique for Vietnam but its
materials and mode of expression must be an original art of
Vietnam. In this sense, while preserving the national tradition,
lacquer painting has to absorb elements of modernity of the world.
I would stress that in any case, quality must come first and this
is what differentiates one artistic work from another.

An ever larger proportion of the newly enrolled students wish to
learn lacquer painting, perhaps because this remains a genre of art
which still opens many windows for innovation. There is, however,
the risk of confounding the lacquer painting art with the
traditional craft of making lacquer ware for votive or decorative
purposes."

Pham Anh Thuy, 40, a graduate of the oil painting section of the
Hanoi Arts School:

"My first training was architecture and I got my civil engineering
diploma from the Hanoi Building College in 1980. Frankly speaking,
the economic reforms which are going on have offered me a vast
opportunity to make a fortune by using my capacity as a
construction engineer. But I later enrolled inthe Arts Collge
because I felt that painting, especially oil painting, is my
vocation.  I could not live without it even though I know that not
all artists are economically secured to devote themselves entirely
to art. In any case, the business world is not my stuff and I feel
much freer in the world of artistic creation."

Van Thuyet, 42, free-lance painter, who lives a spartan life with
his small vendor wife in a 20m2 room in Tran Nhat Duat street,
Hanoi:

"As you can picture for yourself, the life of a free lance artist
is anything but easy.People call me a surrealist, abstractionist or
something like that. I like to paint things which exist in my own
imaginary world, a world that no living human might have
visualized. Perhaps for this same reason  very few are those who
share my visions and still fewer are those who bought my paintings.
Once I got 1,000 USD for a painting and on another occasion I sold
a bronze statue for 3,000 USD. But these are my chance once in a
life time, so to speak."

Ta Hai, Head of the Youth and Children Program of the Voice of
Vietnam Radio:

"My main job is a radio reporter but I can't do without painting.
I take a special liking for painting on dead leaves. I consider
this to be the best method of achieving self - perfection. I
treasure all I have created after weeks, months and even years of
persistent and laborious work and was always caught between a sense
of regret and self - satisfaction when someone asked to buy a work
of mine. I do not want to part with my own creations but at the
same time it  comforts me to know that my work has been justly
appreciated. The only material of my paintings are the dead leaves,
pressed flower petals, a sheath of an areca leaf, in a word
everything that comes from the plants and trees. I want to preserve
nature and make the best of its beauty.

Young artists of today are more and more inclined to paint
abstractions. Not a few have succeeded but many others have failed
because they have cut themselves off from the practice of life,
that is, from the own source of their creation."

Phan Thi Lan Huong, 40,born in Hue city and teaching arts in Qui
Nhon town,Binh Dinh province, Central Vietnam. She is holding an
exhibition at 29, Hang Bai Street,Hanoi:

"I paint mainly on silk but I also make paper cuts and also try my
hand at lacquer. My favourite colour is black, not because I took
a dim view of life but  only to give greater relief to the bright
spots such as red, yellow and white.A  viewer of my paintings said:
"Your pictures give me a sense of true relief."That may be too
flattering a word but the fact remains that I want to impart the
sense of beauty and relaxation to people around me. This is also
perhaps why I like to paint women and nature.

At this exhibition alone I have sold ten paintings, the highest
priced is 1,000 USD. I consider myself much luckier than my
colleagues in Qui Nhon and other small towns. I'm looking forward
to some practical aid from the Vietnam Arts Association to help
painters in small towns like Qui Nhon also to have access to the
large public including foreign art lovers and researchers."

Quach Dong Phuong, teacher at the Hanoi Arts College:

"I have painted all these twenty years and my subjects are nothing
but scenes of daily life: going to the market, replanting rice,
family visits.... Some people rightly noted that the conical palm
leaf hat is nearly omnipresent in my pictures. I want in fact to
"personalize" my works by the conical hat, but not that alone. I
think that the conical hat is a traditional trait of the nation
which must be preserved in any form, including painting and
sculpture.

I am listed among the "richest" among Vietnamese painters. That may
be true or not, but the fact remains that I have sold many
paintings to several countries in Asia such as Singapore, Japan and
South Korea. Some European countries have also displayed my works.
I am told that they like my paintings because they combine very
successfully modernity and traditionality."

Nguyen Quoc Huy, 25, graduating from the Hanoi Arts College in
1994:

"Freedom of creation is my guiding principle and my greatest source
of self satisfaction. It might have been different if I had been
born in earlier times when everything depended on the government.
Now we have opened all the windows to the world, including the
artistic window. This enables us young painters and sculptors to
broaden our perspectives through increasing exchanges with the
outside artistic world. Lacquer paintings is my preference and is
a relatively safe way of making a living. If you are lucky enough
to sell two, or even one, lacquer paintings, it might sustain you
and your family for a whole year. When things go awry, I take up
other genres such as designing book covers, or painting posters and
advertisements".

VIETNAM: GROWING PRESENCE OF YOUNG PAINTERS, A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Duong Tuong

Painters 23 to 40 years of age account for 60% of the membership of
the Vietnam Fine Arts Association, according to Ms. Vu Giang Huong,
General Secretary of the Association.

The common and easily discredible trait of all the galleries and
exhibition is the growing presence of the young generation of
artists. It is that the older generation of artists has died or
silently withdrawn from the art market. Exhibitions by such
luminaries like Nguyen Tu Nghiem and Diep Minh Chau still attract
a large number of visitors, but they are greatly outnumbered by the
exhibitions of young painters who accounted for 400 of the 650
exhibits in 1995. "That is a welcome development," said Dzu Thanh,
a senior member of the Arts Association because they have been, and
will be, the vanguard to integrating Vietnamese art onto the world
scene. They are also the most dynamic force to vitalize and
diversify painting and sculpture in our country. All styles, genres
and perspectives are being accepted provided they do not run
counter to Vietnamese traditions. The young artists are eager to
test their worth through galleries and exhibitions which open
almost weekly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the two largest art
centres of the country. Their presence might also be the best
influence to eliminate all that is extravagant and eccentric.
Censorship in the truest sense of the word belong to the public,
not to any vested power. Some tendencies toward eccentricity and
eroticism have been quickly dismissed by the public even though the
press rarely interferes in these so-called "experimentation".Ta
Hai, an art lecturer commented: "I am a painter myself but I must
confide that some  enigmatic and eccentric paintings are past
comprehension or unstandable only to their author. In my view, the
search for the new must not allow us to disregard the public".

VIETNAM: YOUTH UNION RAISES PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT HIV/AIDS

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

A two-day conference on HIV/AIDS was held in Hanoi on Sept. 23-24
to raise public awareness about the HIV/AIDS disease and its
dangerous effect on youth.

Reports made at the conference said over 50% of HIV infected people
are between 15-24 years of age and in some places the rate of
HIV-infected girls is double that of HIV-infected boys in the 15-19
age group.

The conference aimed to raise public awareness about the epidemic
and seek solutions to prevent it from spreading. Participants in
the conference called for innovative partnerships and efficient
assistance among government agencies, communities, non-governmental
organisations, families of infected people and the private business
sector to help promote efforts against HIV infection.

Speaking at the conference Dr. Roy Morey, UN Resident Co-ordinator
and UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, said: "As elsewhere,
recognition and acceptance that everyone is at risk, and therefore
has a part to play in overcoming the AIDS epidemic, are key in
reversing the trend of rising infection rates".

Mr. Steve Kraus, Country Programme Advisor for UNAIDS, called for
special efforts "To provide this education to all children and
youth, especially those who are harder to reach such as children of
minorities, indigenous people, and street children."

A two-year UNDP project launched in early 1996 has selected Vietnam
as a priority for its assistance. The one-million USD project is
aimed at enhancing Vietnam's capacity to plan and coordinate the
implementation of policies and programme for the prevention of HIV
infection and care of HIV-infected people.

Funding for the conference has come from Vietnam's National AIDS
Committee, America Online, John Snow Inc., Health Ed and UNDP.

VIETNAM: COAL INDUSTRY NEEDS OVER 9 TRILLION VND UP TO 2010

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Quynh Trang

Sources at the Vietnam Coal Corporation (VINACOAL) said that the
coal industry will need about 9.4 trillion VND between now and 2010
to boost its production.

This sum, the sources said, is included in a development plan for
the industry for the period.

Under this plan, the development of the coal industry is to be made
in two stages. The first stage now to 2000 requires capital of
3,400 billion VND. The second stage  from 2000 to 2010, requires
capital of 5,900 billion VND.

Mr. Doan Van Kien, general director of VINACOAL, told VNC that in
1996, the industry's output may reach 9 million tons. In 2000, it
may increase to 12 million tons/year, instead of 10 million tons as
so far projected.

A problem for the industry, said Mr. Kien, is how to expand its
market outlets. VINACOAL has set in exports an annual target of
between 3 and 4 million tons/year in the upcoming years. In the
first 9 months of this year, its exports have reached 2.3 million
tons. Mr. Kien also said that VINACOAL has signed long-term
contracts to export coal to Japan and a number of northern European
countries.

VIETNAM: LEATHERWARE INDUSTRY LOOKS FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

Sources at the Vietnam Leatherware Association said that the
leatherware industry is looking for some 465 million USD in
investment to improve its technologies, boost its output by 2.5
times and triple its export value to 1 billion USD by 2000.

The industry plans to acquire this investment capital through
selling stocks, attracting foreign direct investment, and taking
bank loans.

Of late, the industry has shown good signs of improvement, with its
turnover up by 462% compared with the same period last year. In the
first eight months of this year, it is expected to achieve an
output of 250 million pairs of shoes and 5,500 tons of products
made of genuine or imitation leather, and gross 685 billion VND,
17% higher than the whole  of 1995.

The leatherware industry has been rather attractive to foreign
investment. Of the more than 100 leatherware businesses in the
country at present, 12 are joint ventures and 22 are fully
foreign-owned.

VIETNAM: NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLASTICS INDUSTRY

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Le Thanh Huyen

It is not by chance that the recent Asian Plastics Forum in Ho Chi
Minh City attracted more than 200 delegates from various regional
manufacturers, including 51 from Japan. Vietnam has in recent years
become a potentially lucrative market for plastic products. Not
only has its need for materials for plastics production increased
steadily, from 100,000 tons/year in 1992 to 300,000 tons in 1995
and a projected 370,000 tons in 1997, but its fast-growing oil
industry is also making it a potentially important supplier of
materials for the plastics industry.

Growing need

Industry experts are unanimous that Vietnam's need for materials
for plastics production will increase much faster in the next three
to five years. Auto plants, telecommunications equipment factories,
cement plants, and many other industrial projects under
construction will be requiring quality plastic products.

Cement officials, for instance, said that their industry alone
will, by the year 2000, need about 300 million plastic bags.
However, all they have now is a small mill in Can Tho which
produces only 14 million plastic bags/year.

For the time being, the country's need for materials for plastics
production is being met mostly by imports from Southeast Asian
countries. Only 4% of those materiatls, however, are used in
high-quality products. But this situation is expected to change in
a few years when the country's petro-chemical industry is ready to
begin production.

Already, Petronas, the Malaysian oil producer, has invested 4
million USD in helping the Vietnamese Government design the
blueprint for its petro-chemical industry. Meanwhile, Mitsui of
Japan is applying for a license to invest in building an
82-million-USD mill attached to the oil refinery to be built at
Dzung Quat in central Vietnam.

According to a plan being designed by the Ministry of Industry,
Vietnam will be producing each year starting in 2010, about 500,000
tons of PVC, 330,000 tons of PP, 200,000 tons of PS, and 75,000
tons of DOP.

Industry experts predict that given its good resources, Vietnam can
then focus more on producing materials for plastics production
rather than manufacturing plastic consumer goods as it has been so
far. The plastic products it produces then should be mostly for
high-end markets.

The needed investment

According to the Vietnam Plastics Corporation, Vinaplast, in order
to reach the above targets, the Vietnamese plastics industry should
invest at least 1 billion USD between now and the year 2005, mostly
in high-tech plastics. Thus they could reduce the volume of plastic
consumer goods from the present 60% of total output to only 20%.
About half of this investment is planned to come from foreign
sources through joint ventures or loans schemes.

Officials of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) said
that they have so far licensed 30 investment projects in the
plastics industry, with a total capital of 330 million USD. Twelve
of these projects are wholly foreign-owned.

However, the officials also said that most of these projects are
small and focused only on producing consumer goods. There have been
so far only two projects for producing PVC compound, two others
producing PVC resin, and a 15-million-USD project in plastic
insulation for electronic parts, they said.

One of the projects to produce materials for the plastics industry
is the Oxy-Vina, a 109.4-million-USD joint venture among  Tramasuco
and VietGas of Vietnam, Oxychem of the US, and Marubeni of Japan to
produce PVC compound. It is located in Ba Ria-Vung Tau and is
scheduled to start operation in 1999. As this article goes to
press, it is reported that Petronas of Malaysia is negotiating a
deal to take over Oxychem's share in this joint venture.

The other on-going materials  projects include the 92-million-USD
joint venture between Vinaplast and Mitsui of Japan which is to
start producing 80,000 tons of PVC resin/year in 1997 and the
12-million-USD joint venture between Vinaplast and Lucky GoldStar
of South Korea which is to produce 30,000 tons of DOP/year.

VIETNAM: ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN DILEMMA: OUTGROWING THE TIGHT
SHIRT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Quynh Trang

The electricity industry is caught in a dilemma. On the one hand,
it is being told to produce, between now and the year 2000, about
30 billion kWh/year to meet the needs of the economy. On the other
hand, it has not yet acquired the capital to develop both its
generating capacity and its electric grid to match the economy's
growth, let alone double the 1995 output of 14.6 billion kWh in
only four years.

In a recent interview with VNC, Mr. Truong Bao Ngoc, deputy general
director of the Vietnam Electricity Corporation (VEC), said that
for the electric industry to fulfil its plan, it needs an
investment of about 6 billion USD in the 1996-2000 period. But, he
said, our biggest problem now is finance. We are not in any
position to balance our budget and make significant investments in
developing power resources and a distribution network. Demand has
been increasing faster than the supply and this may result in a
power shortage in the 1996-98 dry seasons. The power grid is either
overloaded or inefficient in many places".

In search of a solution

To help the electricity industry overcome its financial problems,
the Government has allowed it to retain all its capital
depreciation fund for the period from now until 2000 for
reinvestment. It is also allowed to increase electricity prices by
about 70% during this period (the maximum expected to be 800 VND or
about 0.70 USD for a kWh) and mobilise funding from other domestic
sources. However, experts said, all these new funds will, at best,
meet only 30% of the industry's financial needs. The rest will be
made up by loans from foreign banks and financial institutions such
as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

An important form of investment is coming through
Build-Operate-Transfer projects  or joint ventures. By now, the
industry has had three BOT projects which are expected to be
completed before 2000. They include the 300-MW thermo-electric
power plant (phase I) in Quang Ninh province, the 600-MW
gas-operated power plant II (phase II) in Phu My, Ba Ria-Vung Tau
province and the 620-MW gas-operated power plant III, also in Phu
My, Ba Ria-Vung Tau. They will be followed by a number of other
power projects, in both northern and southern provinces. It is
projected that the BOT plants will generate about 30% of the total
output of all domestic power plants.

A problem with the BOT plants which is being addressed is the
timing of their transfer. Because of the low price of electricity
in Vietnam, which is meant to keep it within the reach of most
low-income customers, an early transfer will make BOT electricity
too expensive. Meanwhile, a prolonged transfer which would keep the
price low, would result in a relatively higher depreciation 1 on
equipment.

Whatever the solution may be, it will be carefully balanced to make
the output price reasonable for both the project owners and
customers, industry sources said.

For the immediate future, the industry is taking measures to ensure
a stable power supply. These measures include upgrading existing
coal- and diesel-fuelled power plants and accelerating the
construction of on-going power projects. There are also measures
planned to reduce the electricty loss in transmission to 0.5% each
year from now to 2000.

Experts at the FPT, a leading Vietnamese computer dealer, said that
Compaq products are accounting for almost 20% of the local computer
market.

Compaq's market share in many other countries has been only 10% or
less, the experts said.

Sources at the Daewoo group of South Korea said that they are still
determined to continue their joint venture with the Hanoi Bus
Service Company to build an integrated bus service in the
Vietnamese Capital City.

The project is still under consideration by the government even
though it was signed two years ago.

A reason for this delay is that many people have been skeptical
about its profitability since it would cost a rather huge amount.

The project has a total investment capital of 136 million USD to
which Vietnamese side is to contribute 30%.

A ground for hope for the investors is the recent government
approval of the allocation of 26 ha of land area for the operation
of a public bus system in Hanoi.

The government has encouraged both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to
develop their public transport systems. Recently, it has effected
a temporary halt on the licensing of new taxi companies and now
only licenses bus companies.

VIETNAM BEGINS MAKING DIARRHEA MEDICINE FOR CHILDREN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Pham Thanh Thuy

An oresol production factory has just been put into operation in
the central coastal province of Khanh Hoa to help fight against
diarrhea among children under 5.

For the first time Vietnam can produce this medicine, which
according to a World Health Organisation study, is quite effective
in the treatment of diarrhea, one of the six child killers.

The factory, capacity 10 million packs/year, can meet the national
demand, which is estimated at 4 million packs/year for diarrhea and
about 6 million packs for other diseases such as malaria and Dengue
fever.

In the first year of operation, the factory is expected to turn out
2 million packs and will increase the production in the following
years until it runs at full blast.

More than half of the project cost of 750,000 USD is funded by the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as part of its package aid
for the National Programme for Control of Diarrhea Disease (CDD).
Since 1984 UNICEF has granted CDD about 400,000 USD/year in medical
personnel training and supply of oresol. The programme is covering
95% of villages and communes throughout the country.

VIETNAM: THE LU PEOPLE

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

The Lu have about 3,700 inhabitants settling in two districts of
Phong Tho and Sin Ho of Lai Chau province.

The Lu are also called Lu, Nhuon and Duon. Many ancient vestiges
are found in Dien Bien, but there are a few Lu people living there.
Lu language belongs to the Tay-Thai group.

The Lu have practised farming from time immemorial. They plough and
harrow the fields, dig canals for irrigation, sow rice seeds and
transplant rice, but do not weed or use fertilizers. The Lu also
use burnt-over land to grow corn, cassava, groundnut, indigo and
cotton. Every family has its private garden around their house. The
Lu's staple food is sticky rice. They like to drink tea and men
like to smoke tobacco with bubble pipes.

Weaving is the most widespread sideline occupation. Each family has
several looms. The Lu are very skilful in weaving, sewing and
embroidery. Their garments are decorated with colourful motifs on
dark indigo cloth.

The Lu live in houses on stilts. The back - side of the roof is
shorter than the front one which reaches down to cover the corridor
and stairs. The entrance door faces northwest. Each house has two
kitchens, one used to cook daily meals and the other to boil water.

Young men and women are free to choose their partners. The
fortuneteller plays an important role in the matching of a couple.
The husband must live with the wife's family for two or three years
before building their own home. The children take the father's
family name. All Lu boys have the common mid-name Ba and the girls,
the mid-name.Y. The Lu are friendly and faithful. Divorce is rare.
As is the custom, he or she who asks for a divorce will be fined.

Buddhism is the predominant religion. After the dead person is
buried the family builds a paper sepulchral house decorated with
beautiful designs and fills it with cloth, mattress, paddy and
money to take the deceased's soul to the pagoda.

The Lu like to sing Khap (sung verses), tell old stories, proverbs,

COMMERCE'S ROTHKOPF LEAVING

     David J. Rothkopf -- who has been acting Undersecretary of
Commerce for International Trade since the departure of Jeffrey
Garten last October (WTD, 9/29/95) -- yesterday announced he too
is leaving the department later this month.
     Mr. Rothkopf -- who joined Commerce in late 1993 after
having served as chief executive officer of International Media
Partners -- will become the managing director of Kissinger and
Associates, a strategic consulting firm in Washington and New
York.

DRUG MAKERS WANT USTR TO GET TOUGH WITH ARGENTINA

     The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
yesterday called on the US Trade Representative to get tough with
Argentina because of its failure to fulfill promises to
strengthen its intellectual property rights protection laws (WTD,
11/22/95).
     Despite repeated promises to improve the law, patent piracy
in the pharmaceutical sector continues, PhMA President Gerald J.
Mossinghoff wrote US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.  The
lack of movement is costing US drug manufacturers some $500
million a year in lost sales opportunities.
     Mr. Mossinghoff said Argentina "should receive a clear
message -- the US will not accept further procrastination and
failure to enact a new patent protection law.  A comprehensive
strategy -- one that features sustained face-to-face negotiations
with Argentine officials, and the possibility of enforcement
action if talks fail -- should be developed."
     Argentina sits on a less important "special watch list"
under the Section 301 program, the association said.
     In the interim, Argentina has actually passed legislation
that weakens protection of intellectual property rights for all
fields of technology.  "Correcting that problem should be a top
USTR priority in 1996," Mr. Mossinghoff wrote.

CREATING JOBS DECLARED MAIN CHALLENGE FACING GERMANY IN 1996

Reducing Germany's stubbornly high unemployment, the country's
leaders agreed as 1995 drew to a close, stands as the most
important task for the coming year. Across the political
spectrum, German politicians acknowledged that creating new
jobs must be given the highest priority in public policy.
Religious and labor leaders warned, however, that job creation
must not come at the expense of the social welfare system.
Speaking to the nation in his annual New Year's Eve address,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said "the battle against unemployment"
would be his government's main concern in 1996. The German
economy, he noted, continues to expand, but growth has not
brought about a much needed breakthrough on the job front. New
thinking is necessary, the chancellor insisted as he promised
that job creation would be the focus of talks between the
government, labor leaders and representatives of industry, "We
will be able to address the future successfully only if we find
common answers to the issues that concern us," he said. "Every
reasonable proposal, every forward-looking initiative should be
considered and not rejected out of hand or subjected to the
destructive effects of sustained public controversy." Given
plans to curtail government bureaucracy and cutbacks at major
corporations, much of the impetus for job creation will have to
come from small and medium-sized businesses, Germany's famed
Mittelstand, Kohl went on to argue, and particular attention
must be given to encouraging new businesses and self-
employment. "Anyone who starts up anew business in our country
creates employment and a living for an average of four
additional persons," he observed. "In Germany, we need a new
spirit of enthusiasm for business start-ups. We need men and
women who are self-confident and able to translate their ideas
into action."
Like the chancellor, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth (CDU)
called for a "unprejudiced" examination of a broad variety of
proposals to boost employment. Suessmuth, speaking in a radio
interview New Year's Day, cited the "Alliance for Work"
recently put forward by the industrial union IG Metall as one
such proposal that warrents serious consideration (cf. TWIG
11/3/95, p.4). Last November, union head Klaus Ziwckel
suggested labor would be willing to forego wage increases in
exchange for guarantees of job security from employers and an
end to government plans to cut social welfare spending. In
addition to considering proposals like that, Suessmuth said,
emphasis has to be placed on investment. That includes not only
investment in the industries of tomorrow, she stressed, but
also in efforts to put people back to work, even if in only
menial jobs and even if at the taxpayers' expense. That could
lead to higher social security deductions from the paychecks of
the employed, Suessmuth acknowledged, but otherwise the social
welfare systems is threatened with collapse as growing numbers
of Germans - the unemployed and holders of exempted low-wage
jobs (see story page 5) - find themselves unable to contribute.
An "alliance for the social state," according to the public
employees' union DAG, is needed to protect Germany's social
welfare system against excessive cuts in the interests of
employers. "Attacks on the social system by employers and
politicians make it necessary to organize social counter forces
in 1996," DAG board member Lutz Freitag told reporters in
Hamburg at the year's close. It is incompatible with the goals
set out in the Basic Law, Germany's constitution, that the less
affluent are increasingly being pushed to the margins of German
society, he said. That message was echoed by Bishop Klaus
Engelhard of Hannover (Lower Saxony), chair of the governing
board of Germany's Evangelical Church. The growing gap between
rich and poor, the bishop said in his New Year's Eve sermon,
threatens Germany's social consensus. He thus welcomed
Zwickel's call for an "Alliance for Work" and urged labor and
industry to sit down with the government for talks.

HERZOG PROCLAIMS JANUARY 27 DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR VICTIMS OF
NAZISM

January 27 will henceforth be a national day of remembrance for
the victims of Nazism, President Roman Herzog of Germany has
proclaimed. It was on that day in 1945 that the Auschwitz
concentration camp was liberated. Auschwitz, the president
noted in a proclamation he issued Wednesday (January 3), stands
as a symbol of the Nazis' racist and genocidal policies. The
Nazi terror must never be forgotten, Herzog said, and future
generations must be made mindful of what happened in Germany
during the Third Reich so that nothing comparable will ever
again be allowed to occur. The newly designated day of
remembrance will pay tribute to the millions of men, women and
children who were tortured and murdered by the Nazis, to every
individual who suffered persecution and disenfranchisement
during the twelve-year nightmare of the Third Reich.
The day after Herzog made his proclamation, Bundestag President
Rita Suessmuth (CDU) announced that the parliament will hold a
session to commemorate the victims of  Nazism on January 19.
President Herzog, she said, had agreed to address the special
session.

NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LAW TO REMAIN IN
EFFECT DESPITE COURT RULING

An affirmation action law will remain in effect in the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia despite a court ruling against it, state
officials indicated late last month. On December 19, a state
superior administrative court (Oberverwaltungsgericht) in
Muenster rejected a petition from a woman who had been passed
over for a promotion in favor of a male colleague. Under North
Rhine-Westphalia's law to advance equality in the workplace,
women are to be favored over men with comparable skills and
qualifications in hiring and promotion until the office or
department in question has equal numbers of men and women. In
rejecting the petition, the court, which had previously
declared the law unconstitutional, invoked a recent ruling by
the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The European court
ruled in October that a similar affirmative action law in the
state of Bremen violated guarantees of equal treatment for all
individuals contained in European Union law (cf. TWIG 10/20/95,
p.4).
Minister of Women Ilse Ridder-Melcher (SPD) of North Rhine-
Westphalia announced that the disputed law will remain in
effect because the superior administrative court does not have
the authority o invalidate a law passed by the state
parliament. Only the Federal Constitutional Court, she noted,
can do so. Approximately 40 men have sought to challenge the
constitutionality of the North Rhine-Westphalia affirmative
action law since the beginning of the decade, but all have
ultimately withdrawn their complaints upon receiving promotion.
Two men, Ridder-Melcher said, recently filed complaints against
the law.
Comparing North Rhine-Westphalia's law on promoting women with
Bremen's, Ridder-Melchers told the Frankfurter Rundschau, is
like comparing apples and oranges. In North Rhine-Westphalia's,
she notes, women are not automatically given preference over
men. Each case must be reviewed individually to assure that the
man or men involved are not put under unfair hardship by hiring
or promoting women in their place. This clause, in Ridder-
Melcher's view, puts North Rhine-Westphalia's law on more solid
legal footing than Bremen's. In 1993, she said, the Federal
Labor Court upheld the validity of the law.

NUMBER OF ETHNIC GERMAN RESETTLERS DROPPED IN 1995

The number of ethnic Germans resettling in the Federal Republic
dropped slightly last year, the Federal Ministry of the
Interior announced Monday (January 1). In 1995, a total of
217,898 ethnic Germans registered as resettlers in Germany,
roughly 5,000 fewer than the 222,591 who did in 1994. The
overwhelming majority (209,409) came from the successor states
to the Soviet Union. Most of the remainder came from either
Romania (6,519) or Poland (1,677). During 1995, German
authorities received 260,556 applications from ethnic Germans
seeking to resettle in the Federal Republic. Approximately
100,00 ethnic Germans in the former East Bloc, the ministry
reports, have received permission to emigrate to the Federal
Republic but have not yet done so. Ministry officials believe
most do not intend to use their entry permits unless an
emergency arises.
Not all the ethnic Germans leaving their homes in the Central
Asiatic states of the Commonwealth of Independent States are
resettling in Germany. According to Ministry of the Interior
Parliamentary State Secretary Horst Waffenschmidt (CDU),
approximately 10,000 ethnic Germans left Central Asia for the
Russian Federation. Many settled in western Siberia, which has
a 600,000-strong German minority. Both Russia and Germany,
Waffenschmidt noted, support this migration.
The number of ethnic Germans who opt to resettle in Germany
during the coming year will depend on the political situation
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Waffenschmidt said.
Germany's goal is to accept a limited number of resettlers
while providing development aid to German minorities in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet republics. Particular emphasis
will be placed on intensifying ties between Germany and ethnic
German communities this year. Germany is contributing toward
the construction of community centers which will offer, among
services, courses in the German language. More aid will also be
offered this year to support small and medium-sized businesses
in ethnic German communities.

THE PRESS ON THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
(January 2) "It seems 1996 will be the year of alliances in
German economic policy. The chancellor, as part of a general
plan of action, wants to join in the `alliance for jobs,'
proposed by Klaus Zwickel, chairperson of the IG Metall
metalworkers union. SPD party leader Oskar Lafontaine would
like to bring all the social forces into an `employment pact.'
And the Public Employees Union, suspecting that meetings with
the chancellor and employment experts have involved a critical
look at social (security) costs, is making a cautionary appeal
to the churches of an `alliance for the social state'
(Sozialstaat).
Those rubrics indicate the right priorities. Reducing
unemployment is the most urgent economic issue for Germany. The
connection between unemployment and social costs is a spiral
into fiscal calamity: social welfare payments increase business
costs, leading to unemployment, and unemployment requires
increased contributions to let the social fund bear the costs
of joblessness. If there is no action, the society moves toward
ever higher unemployment, a prisoner of the social spiral it
constructed. The necessity of halting that fateful turn needs
no further explanation. That brings up the question how.
Zwickel's proposal makes clear, above all, where the risk is in
a new collectivism of alliances. Unemployment has occured
because the wages reached through collective bargaining don't
correspond to the employment requirements of employees and the
profit and loss position of businesses. The errors of these
collective agreements are now supposed to be cured by an even
more far-reaching collective agreement. In exchange for a
promise vaguely binding them to moderation, the partners of
the `alliance,' in the stead of business, are promising to
procure hundreds of thousands of jobs, and the state should
forget about revising the social system. That will not work;
high employment won't come out of it.
From the point of view of the unions, however, the Zwickel
alliance has an entirely different aim: to bring in the unions
as players in the center of a corporative policy. One shouldn't
fall into that trap."

Sueddeutsche Zeitung
(Munich, December 30) "It's difficult enough to read between
the lines, even harder to extract the insinuations. Helmut
Kohl's New Year's speech will not make it easy for readers or
listeners, at least not those who are interested in finding out
from the chancellor what the new year will really bring by way
of problems or opportunities.. `Much has gone well, but not
everything.' If that isn't the epitaph of the year! Or maybe
even better: `In retrospective we are looking backwards, but
the future is ours only if we are confident.'
Jokes aside, the chancellor is stating the obvious: no
breakthrough in employment. But he isn't what he needs to:
tighten those belts a little tighter! Business people should
stop complaining and get down to business! It's time to
redefine and rediscover social consensus in the face of vastly
changed worldwide market conditions! Be more flexible! Less
vacation! More participation in (meeting) social costs from
those who can do so! And everything else you could put an
exclamation point to...
Instead, Kohl clothes the need to save and cut down and be
realistic in vague terms: `There can't be any exceptions.' And
he promises a new growth of small and medium-sized businesses.
Where will that come from? `Ideas' and the `courage of
independence' do not suffice. Public policy needs the courage
to create the right conditions. But maybe it's too much to ask
for anything concrete on New Year's Eve. During the night
fireworks will explode into momentary dreams. Then it soon will
be day again with plenty of time for the truth."

General-Anzeiger
(Bonn, December 30) "The social state is not the cause of
structural change (in German society), but rather it makes the
consequences of (that change) - in particular mass unemployment
- at least halfway endurable, since it saddles everyone (with
responsibility) for them. Whoever shrinks (the social state)
too severely will not only create room for maneuver for new
investment, but also a different society. But solidarity is not
a one-way street, not in the family or in the work place or in
politics. The French learned this painfully during the weeks of
strikes before Christmas. It is obvious to say but difficult to
put into action: the Germans must act together to meet the
challenges they face."

Berliner Morgenpost
(December 30) "For better or worse, our leisure and good-time
society will have to get used to the fact that unified Germany
has taken on a new role in international politics. That does
not mean first and foremost more prestige, but rather more
responsibility, which is an encumbrance to each and every
individual citizen. We are flattered to be considered one of
the world's prosperous, indeed rich nations, when Germany is
admired for its political and economic stability. But we are
overcome with dread when we think about the transformation of
the D-mark into the euro. So, too, is sending German troops
into a war zone for the first time ever, where they might
become involved in combat actions, part of the price that an
enlarged Germany has to pay.

YEAR'S END BRINGS REVISIONS IN ECONOMIC FORECASTS

As 1995 drew to a close, a handful of Germany's leading
economics institutes made last minute revisions in their
predictions of the country's economic performance. Each fall,
six research institutes join in presenting a report on their
expectations for the German economy. This past October, the six
agreed that growth for 1995 would stand at about 2.25 percent
and reach 2.5 percent in 1996 (cf. TWIG 10/27/95, p.4). Three
of the six announced in late December, however, that they had
been over optimistic in their outlook for the coming year. In
its December monthly report, the Federal Ministry of Economics
likewise pointed to disappointing economic performance in the
second half of 1995, but nonetheless predicted continued
economic recovery in the next twelve months.
The Munich-based Ifo institute announced on December 20 that it
now expects economic growth of 2.0 percent for 1995 and 1.75
percent for 1996 rather than the previously anticipated 2.25
and 2.5 percent.. The institute cited disappointing capital
investment figures for the second half of 1995 in issuing its
revised forecast, but stressed that it does not expect Germany
to slip into recession. Private consumption boosted by tax
breaks will help the economy, according to Ifo, and investment
and exports are expected to recover from the effects of a
strong D-mark and high wage settlements. But unemployment will
change little over the year and probably drop by only one-tenth
of a percent o 9.5 percent, Ifo now believes. Hamburg's HWWA
Institute for Economic Research similarly announced that it now
expects economic growth of only 2.0 percent for 1995, but, like
Ifo, it believes the recovery process should pick up in 1996
and that the German economy will not slip into recession
The Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research said it
still expects 2.25 percent growth for 1995, but maintained that
the German economy is not performing as well as it could. The
anticipated growth, the institute added, will hardly help
change the employment situation in Germany as a whole; it
foresees a reduction in unemployment only in the eastern half
of the country. In the view the Institute for Economic Research
(IWH), Halle (Saxony-Anhalt), the eastern economy should grow
by 4.8 percent in 1996. Limited growth in the west, according
to IWH, will slow growth in the east.
Acknowledging a number of factors slowing Germany's economic
recovery, the Federal Ministry of Economics pointed to others
in its December report that should give the economy a boost in
coming months. Low interest rates, stable prices and increases
in household incomes arising from tax cuts should help lift the
economy after 1995's disappointing fourth quarter. Preliminary
data on fourth quarter production, contracts and wholesale
prices, the report said, suggest that growth in the second half
of the year will stand at about 1.5 percent, a marked drop from
the 2.6 percent registered in the first six months of 1995.

COMPUSERVE RESTRICTS ACCESS TO 200 IN RESPONSE TO GERMAN
INVESTIGATION

The computer network firm CompuServe announced Friday (December
29) that it was restricting access to 200 Internet sites in
response to an investigation by public prosecutors in Munich.
In late November, the public prosecutor's office in Munich
launched an investigation to determine whether the CompuServe
network was being used to distribute materials that violate
German law. Specifically, prosecutors believe child pornography
and pornographic materials legally off limits to minors are
being disseminated via CompuServe's German subsidiary,
CompuServe GmbH. To forestall any further violations of German
law, officials at CompuServe's headquarters in the United
States said they were blocking access to 200 sites dealing with
sexual topics. The restrictions will affect CompuServe users
around the world because, as the company explained, it cannot
currently tailor its services to meet the different national
laws in each of the countries where it has subscribers.
CompuServe says it provides network services to over four
million subscribers throughout the world, including 220,000 in
the German-speaking nations. According to the public
prosecutors office, officials at CompuServe GmbH's Munich
office voluntarily turned over materials to investigators on
November 22. CompuServe has emphasized that it cannot control
what its subscribers make available through the Internet and
called for investigations that are "specifically focused on
those people and groups that place materials on the Internet."
Chief Prosecutor Manfred Wick told reporters Tuesday (January
2) that his office has sought the advice of technical experts
to determine whether the providers of online services are
capable of preventing the distribution of illegal materials.

EUROPE ONLINE JOINS RANKS OF NETWORK PROVIDERS IN GERMANY

Competition among the providers of online services in Germany
became tighter on December 15 as Europe Online went into
operation. The newcomer joins America Online's AOL Europa,
CompuServe, Deutsche Telekom and Microsoft in the race for
subscribers in Germany, where a well-educated population of 80
million makes for a potentially lucrative market. Europe Online
is based Luxembourg and provides services in English, French
and German. Germany's Burda Verlag, the publisher of the
magazines Focus and Bunte, has a 30-percent stake in the
venture.
Another major German media concern, the Axel Springer Verlag,
had planned to participate in Europe Online. Springer, which
publishes the widely read tabloid newspaper Bild, decided
instead to team up with the Bertelsmann media conglomerate and
Deutsche Telekom, the German national phone company, in
participating in America Online's AOL Europa.

SOCIAL SECURITY EXEMPTION FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS DECLARED VALID

Germany's exemption on social welfare contributions for workers
in low-paying jobs, the Luxembourg-based European Court of
Justice ruled last month, does not violate European Union law
and is thus valid. Under German law, workers with monthly
incomes of less than DM 580 (about U.S. $400) do not pay into
the social security system that provides pensions, unemployment
benefits and health insurance. Local courts in Hannover (Lower
Saxony) and Speyer (Rheinland-Pfalz) brought the case before
the European Court of Justice on behalf of three female
domestic workers. According to the local courts, the German law
is discriminatory because the great majority of those who hold
so-called "580 Mark jobs" are women. Dismissing that line of
argument, the European Court of Justice backed the German
government's right to use the exemption to "achieve a socio-
political goal." Bonn maintains that without the exemption,
low-wage jobs would disappear without any corresponding
increase in full-time, higher-wage employment.
The number of people holding "580 Mark jobs" is estimated at
between 4.5 and 6.0 million. By the calculations of the Munich-
based Sueddeutsche Zeitung, about a quarter of them are
employed in private households. Many of the rest hold part-time
jobs in retail sales, manufacturing, and the hotel and
restaurant industry. Other European countries, including
Belgium, France, Great Britain, Ireland and Luxembourg, have
similar social-service exemptions for low wage earners.

"MULTIMEDIA": WAVE OF THE FUTURE SELECTED AS WORD OF THE YEAR

Multimedia," pundits say, is the inevitable wave of the future,
but in the past year, according to the preeminent monitors of
the German tongue, it was the inescapable buzzword of the
moment. The Society for German Language (Gesellschaft fuer
Deutsche Sprache) proclaimed "multimedia" 1995's "World of the
Year" late last month, citing its broad influence on recent
public discussion and debate. "We found a five hundred-percent
increase in the use of the concept `multimedia' this year,"
society spokesperson Gerhard Mueller explained in announcing
the Word of the Year. "Multimedia is the guiding term
(Leitwort) for the journey into the brave new media world."
There will hardly be an area of everyday life, Mueller and his
colleagues speculate, that will not be touched by advances in
information technology in the none too distant future.
Another change on the horizon - if Europe's political leaders
hold firm to newly approved plans - will be the introduction of
a common Eurogeld ("Euro-currency"), the runner-up on the Word
of the Year list. Third place went to the much-discussed
Kruzifixurteil ("crucifix judgement"). In August, the Federal
Constitutional Court ruled that a Bavarian ordinance mandated
the hanging of crucifixes in public school classrooms violated
Germany's constitution, the Basic Law (cf. TWIG 9/8/95, p.6).
The ruling provoked indignation from many Bavarian politicians
and large public protests throughout the state. Prime Minister
Edmund Stoiber (CSU) and his cabinet subsequently drafted
legislation that would change the wording of Bavaria's school
ordinances but still keep crucifixes in the great majority of
classrooms (cf. TWIG 9/15/95, p.7).
Religious concerns also stood behind the society's "Motto of
the Year," Wir sind Kirche ("We are the Church"). The line
served as both the name and the rallying cry of a lay Catholic
initiative calling for reforms within the Roman Catholic Church
(cf. TWIG 11/24/95, p.6; 12/8/95, p.7). Wir sind Kirche
gathered 1.8 million signatures on petition calling for an end
to obligatory clerical celibacy and the prohibition on the
ordination of women, among other changes.
Until last year, the Society for German Language designated the
Unwoerter ("non-words") of the year, the most unfortunate
expressions to enter the language. The Unwoerter selection
committee and the society parted ways in 1994 in the wake of a
controversy over the inclusion of kollektiver Freizeitpark
("collective leisure park"), a term used by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl to criticize Germany's extensive social welfare system,
among the Unwoerter of 1993 (cf. TWIG 1/6/95, p.6). The six-
person selection jury, a spokesperson reported Tuesday (January
2), has received a record number of suggestions from the
general public for 1995's Unwort of the Year. The jury's
verdict is expected later this month.

HEINER MUELLER, LEADING FIGURE IN GERMAN THEATER, DIES FROM
CANCER-RELATED ILLNESS

Heiner Mueller, one of Germany's most respected and most
controversial post-war playwrites, died Saturday (December 30),
a week and a half short of his 67th birthday. The author of
over 30 pieces for the stage, Mueller also earned acclaim for
his work as director and drama theorist. His professional
success was anything but straightforward, however. Mueller was
a Marxist and long time member of the German Democratic
Republic's governing Socialist Unity Party, but he was
temporarily forbidden to publish or stage his socially critical
work in the GDR. From the mid 1960s on, Mueller's plays tended
to be staged more frequently in the Federal Republic and other
nations than in the GDR. Yet even though the East German
authorities were often less than enthusiastic about Mueller's
cynical tone, they nonetheless acknowledged the merit of his
work. In 1986, he was awarded the GDR National Prize for Art
and Literature, one of the country's highest honors. Mueller's
independent stance before the collapse of the GDR was much
lauded, but not long after unification it was revealed he had
served as an "unofficial collaborator" - i.e., as an informer -
for the Stasi, East Germany's secret police. Mueller,
acknowledging that he had been in regular contact with the
Stasi, said he had tried to advise the authorities and to use
his influence constructively.
At the time of his death, Mueller was the artistic director of
the Berliner Ensemble, the theater company founded by Bertold
Brecht in eastern Berlin shortly after the establishment of the
GDR. Like all eastern German cultural institutions, the
Berliner Ensemble entered a period of change and uncertainty
after unification. Mueller was appointed to serve as one of
four co-directors to guide the venerable company's way into the
future. The four-person directorship fell apart late in the
winter of 1995, however, and Mueller, despite having recently
undergone surgery for cancer of the esophagus, accepted an
invitation to take over as sole artistic director.
The members of the Berliner Ensemble, joining with the rest of
the German theatrical and literary community in mourning
Mueller's death, are honoring Mueller's memory with a marathon
reading program. On Tuesday (January 2), company member Hans
Fleischmann began reading Mueller's piece Bericht vom Gro_vater
("Grandfather's Report") before an audience of about two dozen.
The readings will continue through January 9, the day Mueller
would have turned 67.

THE G-7 NATIONS PLEDGE $2.3 BILLION TO HELP CLOSE CHERNOBYL

Plans for the eventual shutdown of the infamous Chernobyl
nuclear power plant came a step closer to realization in late
December as Ukraine and the leading industrial nations came to
a provisional agreement on a financial aid package. The
industrial nations agreed in principle this past spring, nine
years after the accident that made Chernobyl a household word
around the world, to help offset the costs of closing the
hobbled but still operating power plant (cf. TWIG 4/21/95,
p.5). At that time, the amount of aid Ukraine could expect in
exchange for agreeing to shut Chernobyl was left undetermined;
Ukrainian authorities estimated the shutdown would cost a total
of U.S. $4.4 billion. In a statement of intention signed
December 20, the G-7 nations (Canada, France, Germany, Great
Britain, Italy, Japan and the U.S.) declared themselves
prepared to contribute U.S. $500 million in direct toward the
cost of taking Chernobyl out of operation once and for all. The
G-7 and the European Union are also prepared to make available
another $1.8 billion in credits for construction of power
plants to replace Chernobyl. These figures are "targets,"
explained Ukrainian Minister of the Environment Yuri Kostenko.
Further negotiations, he added, will be needed to work out the
details. Canadian Minister of the Environment Shelia Copps, who
signed the statement of intention on behalf of the entire G-7,
described the signing of the statement of intention marked only
the beginning of Chernobyl's closing, a process she said will
take several years to complete. Under current plans, Chernobyl
will be taken out of operation by the year 2000. "Germany is
especially interested in the concrete shell over reactor four,"
a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ministry of the Environment
told the German Press Agency (dpa) the day after the statement
of intention was signed. Ukraine, he added, hopes to negotiate
bilateral aid agreements with the G-7 nations in the next
several weeks so that formal agreements can be signed at a
summit on nuclear security scheduled to take place in Moscow
this March.

SCHOLARS QUESTION CLAIM OF A MAJOR LUTHER DISCOVERY

Readers who can't resist the urge to write in books might be
the bane of librarians' lives, unless, of course, the reader in
question happens to be a major historical figure. If, as some
scholars believe, recently discovered notations in a bible came
from the pen of Martin Luther, the Wuerttemberg State Library,
Stuttgart, will be able to boast of a unique treasure. If, as
others maintain, the marginalia was written by a follower of
Luther's, the library is left with an old book containing old
notes of interest to only a small circle of specialists.
In late November, a researcher named Manuel Santos Noya
announced he had discovered extensive comments in Luther's hand
in a copy of the Vulgate bible, that is, in a copy of the Latin
version of the bible that was considered the authoritative text
of the scriptures in Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages.
Santos Noya argued that the copy of the Vulgate he found in the
Wuerttemberg State Library was the copy Luther had used in
preparing his German translation of the bible. That translation
is widely credited with having played a decisive role in the
development of modern written German, much as the "King James"
translation influenced English prose. If Santos Noya is
correct, the marginal comments he found could throw new light
on Luther's thinking as he prepared his translation and thus
upon an epochal event in German cultural history.
Other scholars have been quick to point to weak points in
Santos Noya's case. Professor Ulrich Bubenheimer of the
University of Heidelberg (Baden-Wuerttemberg), a theologian who
is regarded an authority on sixteenth-century handwriting,
agreed that the marginalia Santos Noya found is written in a
hand that shows many similarities to Luther's, but also many
differences, especially in the way Greek and Hebrew characters
are written. According to Bubenheimer, it was not unusual for
students in the sixteenth century to pattern their handwriting
upon their teachers. Luther's close collaborator Philipp
Melanchthon (1497-1560), he notes by way of example, wrote in a
hand that resembled Luther's.
Bubenheimer and other Luther scholars have underscored
additional  evidence that similarly points to a follower of
Luther rather than Luther himself as the annotator of the
Stuttgart bible. Some one wrote the date January 28,1528 at the
beginning of the text and November 14, 1528 at the end,
suggesting that the annotations were written during that
eleven-month period. Luther, on the other hand, did his
translation of the New Testment in 1521-1522. The annotator
also cites Luther's writings and mentions Luther by name or by
his initials when he does so; Luther is not known to have
followed such a practice. Finally, the initials IW are written
at the end of the text. Bubenheimer and like-minded scholars
suspect that they refer to the owner of the bible who made the
disputed annotations.

KOHL REIGNS SUPREME IN EDITIONAL CARTOONS

The figures are in, and now there's no disputing Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's political stature. An inventory of 110 daily and
weekly newspapers, the German Press Agency (dpa) reports, has
determined that the chancellor was far and away the country's
most frequently caricatured political personality during 1995.
His distinctively well-fed figure - no doubt a godsend to
cartoonists - appeared in a total of 1,127 editorial cartoons,
more than twice as many as the runner-up, Federal Minister of
Finance Theo Waigel (CDU). Waigel's luxuriant eyebrows turned
up in just under 500 cartoons, making them about as well known
to newspaper readers as his unceasing efforts to trim the
federal budget. Lest anyone think Germany's cartoonists unduly
partisan, Rudolf Scharping, until November the national leader
of the opposition Social Democrats, came in a close Third
behind Waigel.

HONGKONG DIARY: At this delicate point in Hong Kong's history, there are
strongarguments for favouring an experienced and well-respected legal
figure: A Suitable Candidate 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.64

WE welcome the entry of Simon Li Fook-sean as a candidate for Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Indeed,
we would suggest that, of the candidates who have presented
themselves, he appears to have the best combination of the
qualities that will be required for this onerous and responsible
position.

Perhaps we should first define those qualities. The CE should -
obviously - be a person of probity and acumen who has distinguished
himself in the eyes of his profession and has a respected standing
in the community.

The successful candidate must also go into this election well aware
that the position aspired to is no sinecure. It will be a taxing,
arduous job, made more difficult by the fact that there will be no
clear precedents to guide him, and any number of carping critics
willing to damn his actions and question his motives.

No doubt, even as we write, the knives are being sharpened by
various factions. The CE's every move will be closely monitored by
the media - both local reporters and the thousands who are expected
to swarm in for next year's ceremony - by the people of Hong Kong,
and by all those on the mainland who have the territory's interests
at heart.

We would also suggest that the person filling the CE position
should be someone of maturity, experienced in the ways of the
world, impervious to flattery and who has attained some distance
from the transitory tug of ego.

While virtually every successful person in Hong Kong has business
interests, the successful candidate should be someone who is
clearly not active in the business community, or likely to return
to an active role at some later date.

Trust: It goes without saying that the first CE of the SAR must be
acceptable to and trusted by Beijing. China reposes great faith in
the people of Hong Kong - after all, the SAR will have a far
greater degree of autonomy than any other territory in China. We
believe that the Beijing leadership will abide by its pledge that
Hong Kong people will rule Hong Kong.

But Hong Kong has been harmed by the tenure of its last colonial
governor. It is now obvious that Chris Patten was sent here by
Britain to perform a PR job for international consumption, whilst
knowing all the while that none of his political manouevrings stood
the slightest chance of ever being allowed to carry through beyond
the transition.

Nonetheless, Patten's machinations have left Beijing deeply
suspicious as to what seeds may have been sown by the outgoing
British administration in Hong Kong's politically green soil. The
CE will have to be someone capable of sniffing out any unexploded
bombs left behind by the outgoing colonial power.

But the first CE must also be someone who enjoys the wholehearted
trust of the people of Hong Kong. He should be someone who was born
here and whose roots are firmly embedded in the territory. To be
the first CE of the SAR will be a lonely job. It is not a job for
the weak, nor one for someone who would seek to appease Hong Kong's
new sovereign.

Conciliation is generally much to be preferred to confrontation at
such a sensitive time and it is in everyone's interest that we
abandon the short-sighted discord that has been an unfortunate
feature of so much of the transition.

But the CE must also be prepared to stand up and be counted upon by
the people of Hong Kong to defend the valid interests of the SAR
within China. He must be someone who is well-versed in the Basic
Law and is adequately prepared to maintain the rule of law that
underpins the territory's prosperity.

Simon Li has enjoyed a respected career in the legal profession,
ending up with his appointment as Vice-President of the Court of
Appeals in 1984 before his retirement in 1987. He maintains a
directorship of the Bank of East Asia, in which his family has
interests. However, while some of his activities post-retirement
have focused on community involvements such as the Society for
Homes for the Handicapped, educational matters and his honorary
stewardship of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, much of his energy
has been devoted to working for a successful transition.

Beginning in 1985 with his appointment to the Basic Law Drafting
Committee, and more recently with his heavy involvement with the
Preparatory Committee, of which he is a Deputy-Director, Li has
developed an intimate knowledge of the details of transition.

He evidently enjoys the respect of and a personal relationship with
senior leaders. But he brings to his candidacy something arguably
more important: a detailed understanding of Hong Kong's legal
system and the Basic Law, and an irreproachable reputation as a
judge.

On a personal note, within his own family he has a lawyer son in
London and another son who is an international news editor with the
Los Angeles Time. His daughter, as head of the Bar Association, is
both respected and a well-known critic of some of Beijing's
actions. Nobody could accuse Simon Li of being out of touch with
sceptics both within and outside Hong Kong.

All those who have put themselves forward for scrutiny in this
unprecedented process deserve our respect. There are those who
argue that, as a financial centre, a businessmen should be the
first CE. We would argue that at this delicate point in Hong Kong's
history, there are strong arguments for favouring an experienced
and well-respected legal figure.

COMMENTARY: SPECULATOR'S DIARY: An Ode to the Market 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PUNDIT, P.61

ARE you a bull or are you a bear?/ Bet against Hong Kong only if
you dare./ 1997 is the year when greed does battle over fear./ The
voice of the bear growls but a thought: /Sell this market, it's far
too overbought!/ 1997 marks Hong Kong's demise./ Under China's
rule, should this come as a surprise?/ The voice of the bull
replies in disdain:/ "Listen investor, there is much more to
gain."/ 1997 is the Gala Ball's start - Hong Kong's celebration -
you must buy to take part!/ So, are you a bull or are you a bear?/
1997 - We are almost there.

Bethany Chan, Worldsec International

UNANIMITY of opinion is the biggest single danger for investors.
Let enough people say there are too few hotel rooms in Bali, or
that there is a glut of oil in the world, and you can be sure that
glum Indonesian hoteliers will soon be slashing room rates, and
airline profits will nose-dive on the soaring cost of aviation
fuel.

The commodity everybody tips to be in short supply is shares in
Hong Kong companies. Pundit's friend Fergy the fund manager says:
"We are all throwing money at the place. Interest rates are stable,
profits will soon jump, politics look great, the dollar is fine. If
Wall Street goes up that is good, if it goes down, that is also
good - more US money will come here. If you absolutely put my feet
to the fire, I might risk a few bob in Malaysia, otherwise this is
the spot. Can't think why I didn't buy when it was cheap."

For every buyer there is a seller. Carlton Poon and his research
team at Worldsec International have just carried out a reality
check on the Hong Kong bourse as the Hang Seng Index hovers around
12,500. They summarize the sell case thus:

 By historic standards the market is not cheap selling at around 14
times earnings.

The p/e discount relative to other regional markets has narrowed,
and the risk-reward balance has become unfavourable in view of the
uncertainties that prevail.

 Valuations here are stretched and profits growth will not be fast
enough to underwrite current prices. Earnings quality could well
deteriorate and earnings per share are vulnerable to equity-fund
raising.

 Wild cards that could trigger a catastrophic fall in the market
include speculation against the Hong Kong dollar, China's reactions
to any demonstrations against the government in Hong Kong,
corruption and breakdown of the legal system, large-scale illegal
immigration from China,

 Loss of competitiveness, due to most expensive property prices in
the world. Labour costs high and skilled workers in short supply.
Ports losing business to China and elsewhere and territory's
position as a financial centre under threat from Singapore and
eventually Taipei and Shanghai.

Worldsec ticks off the buy case:

 The market is cheap because the political discount imposed by
Margaret Thatcher's 1983 visit to Beijing will narrow or disappear.
That paves the way for an upwards re-rating of the market closer to
the valuation of other Asian markets;

 Hong Kong economic growth is expected to accelerate in 1997 aided
by a recovery in spending. The momentum will be maintained an
upturn in the China economy;

 Potential reward outweighs the risks of investing in the PRC. Hong
Kong was midwife to the emergence of China in the world economy and
will play an important and profitable future role in nurturing
growth;

 Structural change in the territory from manufacturing base to
service centre is a major plus.

Worldsec has been consistently positive on Hong Kong equities. In
July 1995 it was the first broker to forecast 20,000 for the Hang
Seng Index. The house remains bullish, particularly on the
political re-rating argument. It has fed the bull and bear factors
into a model which produces a Hang Seng Index down to 9,054 at the
end of 1997 on a worst-case scenario and throws up a best-case
target of 16,847 over the same time frame.

We are taking a modest punt in the shares of Asia Securities. The
company was at one time under the stewardship of Australian tycoon
Bill Wyllie and the Lau Brothers. It is now China controlled and
has a major stake in a number of Beijing real-estate projects. One
of these is very close to the Imperial Palace and is planned as the
heart of the Beijing financial district. The project is 60 per cent
owned by Asia Securities and 40 per cent by Beijing Huayan which is
in turn controlled by upcoming IPO China Resources Beijing Land. We
have bought 50,000 Asia Securities at $2.275. To raise a little
cash, out go half the long-term holding in Fountain Set, where the
performance has been boring.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Tourism Receipts Rising 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

HONG KONG'S earnings from tourism jumped 17.6 per cent in the first
six months of this year to $40.9 billion on a 15.8 per cent
increase in visitors to the territory over the same period last
year. The Hong Tourist Association is forecasting a record $85
billion in earnings from tourism for 1996 as a whole.

Among the 6.44 million visitors in the first six months, north
Asians were the biggest spender, splashing out $9.3 billion, up
37.6 per cent year-on-year, followed by mainlanders, who spent $7.9
billion, up 20.8 per cent.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Hold Your Horsepower 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

WAIT. It may not be over. Scarcely had shareholders in Cepa
finished counting their winnings from the $18.50 a share takeover
bid from Atlanta-based Southern Power, than another possible
counter-bidder emerged.

Typically, the news broke in the press first. Confirmation came
yesterday from Hopewell chief Gordon Wu who said the company had
received "an approach from one third party for the possible
acquisition of a controlling interest in Cepa." His statement
added: "The board would like to emphasize that no offer or formal
proposal has been received from an independent third party."
Investors were advised to tread with caution.

The news sparked heavy trading in Cepa on the stock market where
8.3 million shares changed hands at prices up to $18.10. The price
slipped back to be 10 cents up by the close, at $17.95, with
traders disinclined to believe a takeover battle will break out
over Cepa.

The current discount to the bid price represents the time it would
take to get the takeover cash, together with the slim chance that
stockholders will vote to reject the offer. A spokesman for
Southern in Hong Kong said the company had no comment to make other
than to say it was hopeful that its agreement to acquire control of
Cepa would go through.

CHINA's export boom has forced the organizers of the Guangzhou fair
to move the event to a bigger location. Trade officials say this
week's autumn session of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair could
have attracted some 200,000 exhibitors, but had room for only 6,000
booths.

The new arena will be triple the size of the existing venue with at
least 500,000 square metres of floor space, vice-minister of

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: ADB Approved 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

ASIAN Development Bank is set to become the first foreign bank to
buy into one of China's state-controlled commercial banks by taking
a three to five per cent stake in Everbright Bank of China. The
deal has already been approved by the People's Bank of China.

Chinese regulations permit foreign investors to buy up to 10 per
cent of a Chinese financial institution and sources say ADB has
been encouraged by the central bank to buy into Everbright. Founded
in 1992, Everbright is a subsidiary of state conglomerate China
Everbright Group and had net assets worth 1.68 billion yuan as of
the end of last year. ADB's investment is part of a share
restructuring plan Everbright is conducting to increase its assets
to about 4 billion yuan. The Chinese bank has also said that it
plans to list at some point in the future and increase its branch
network on the mainland from seven to 15-17 outlets within a few
years.

Manila-based ADB, which provides loans for emerging Asian
economies, is a member of a bank consortium that holds a 25 per
cent stake in Xiamen International Bank, a joint venture. It is
also buying into three small Indian banks. Neither ADB nor
Everbright officials would disclose the size of its latest
investment.

P.60

RICHARD Li's Singapore-listed Pacific Century Regional Developments
is taking an 85 per cent interest in a 400 acre township
development project in Huangjinwei Farm near Guangzhou.

The farm is currently owned by Hua Ken Industry and Commerce Co, a
state-owned enterprise of the municipal government and the Chinese
joint-venture partner. The farm will become a large residential
community over three years with construction beginning at the end
of this year.

Phase one of the project has an estimated cost of 400 million yuan.
The project is expected to develop 2 million sq ft of low cost
housing on 21 acres of land, 13 kilometres north of Guangzhou.

A Pacific spokesman says the group's other China project, a
building related to the mass transit project in Beijing is still on
hold because the site has not been delivered. Pacific Century is
engaged in an office-commercial-residential development in Bombay
and the construction and operation of a power plant in Gaoyao,
Guangdong province.

COMMENTARY: AROUND THE SQUARE: No Ifs or Butts 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By MALCOLM SURRY, P.59

COUNSEL for industrialist Leung Wah-chai, who was found guilty of
insider trading this week, asked the Insider Dealing Tribunal to go
easy on his client because he was "an honorary citizen in China."
Leung and his sister-in-law Butt Chin-han were found to have used a
network of offshore companies to unload more than 12 million shares
in audio-cassette maker Yanion International Holdings in May 1993 -
directly in front of news of a profits crash.

Lawyer Terry Poon asked the tribunal not to impose a ban of more
than six months on Leung being a company director because it was
vital that he be at the helm of Yanion through the 1997 handover.
He said Leung ran 78 enterprises employing 3,000 people in the PRC.

During the hearing Leung - whose assets have been put in excess of
$180 million- blamed bad legal advice he had received about share
trading regulations. He noted that he was educated to primary six
in China and had only one-year English schooling in Hong Kong.

This is not the first time Leung seems to have received bad advice.
Leung and Madam Butt were discovered to have carried out improper
dealings in Yanion through an offshore vehicle back at the time of
the public listing in 1991. SFC investigators found that a shell
company in the British Virgin Islands had been used to funnel $108
million for initial subscription and $31.5 million for share
trading to support the price in the first few days after the
flotation. This activity helped conceal the fact that less than the
statutory 25 per cent of Yanion's capital was in the hands of
genuine minority shareholders.

Yanion was one of half a dozen companies named in the scandal
involving the Standard Chartered Asia investment bank. It was found
that the then stockbroking arm of Standard Chartered had advanced
substantial sums of money to major shareholders and their nominees
in companies going public. The facilities were used to artificially
inflate the oversubscription level and to manipulate the market in
the shares when they commenced trading.

Leung and his sister-in-law, along with another director Leung Tai-
shing, were publicly censured by the stock exchange in December
1994 for the 1991 dealings. It would appear that Leung has been
skating on thin ice for some time.

There are those who would put a political spin on the mitigation
argument put forward in the Yanion case. I do not see it that way.
Certainly his counsel gilded the lily by suggesting his client was
"revered" in China. But he was entitled to raise Leung's position
in the business community and the fact that he is apparently a
substantial employer. Since the majority of Hong Kong companies
have investments in the PRC, and cross-border commercial
transactions have become the norm, insider dealing cases are as
likely to have a China connection than not. Politics are
irrelevant.

In fact a case has just started in which it is alleged that
Taiwanese businessman Hwang Chou-shiuan bought shares in the
Parkview property group in Hong Kong in the hope of making a profit
from his knowledge that China International United Petroleum and
Chemical Co was buying a big chunk of the company.

The tribunal will hand down its penalty decision in the Yanion
matter next week. Leung faces having to cough up some $4.35 million
- three times the amount of the loss he was judged to have avoided
by dumping shares. Imposition of the maximum five-year embargo from
being a company director would put him in the same category as
maestro fraudster George Tan. That might be a bit over the top.

I have no idea how prevalent insider dealing is on China's domestic
stock markets. What I do know is that Beijing securities regulators
take a very dim view of the practice. When they eventually codify
national laws for malpractice, the penalties are likely to be
severe. Hong Kong share manipulators might well have cause to
congratulate themselves that their transgressions are dealt with on
this side of the border.

WE HAVE not heard much lately about the mooted second board for
small companies in Hong Kong. The perhaps more innovative Kuala
Lumpur exchange hung out its shingle for speculative companies,
capitalized as small as US$2 million, nearly three years ago. The
KLSE second board index has doubled to 620 this year and tripled
since 1994.

Jardine Fleming tut-tuts over this in its latest unit trust
newsletter and describes the speculative little market as a "death
trap." That is perhaps going a bit far. The relatively meaningless
price/earnings ratio stands at 420, and recent Bank Negra action to
raise deposit levels for margin trading will no doubt hose things
down.

Jardine Fleming says "highly unprofitable" small Malaysian
companies have raised $1 billion on the "rumour-led" market this
year. No doubt many of these companies will disappear up the
Swanee, and the management of some may be probity-challenged.

At least the little bourse provides a venture capital avenue
somewhat lacking in Hong Kong. The banks here would require your
first-born child as collateral before lending money to back a smart
idea. The stock exchange requires a three-year profit track record
from IPOs, and it only seems to grant a waiver to China
infrastructure companies. Knocking on the door of the Nasdaq market
in the US is not yet a proven route to riches for Hong Kong
players.

That leaves the extended Chinese family as the source for raising
capital for a new business - if Uncle Chan-wah is tapped out this
year, tough luck.

Not withstanding all this, I find it hard to support the notion of
a nursery for corporate toddlers in the territory. Having seen what
the manipulators can do with the first board, the blood runs cold
imagining what they might do with a second.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: CATERING: Harry Ramsden's May Bring Batter to
Beijing: Move into China mooted for chippie group 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From PETER MOSLEY in London, P.57-58

ENCOURAGED by the success of its Hong Kong restaurant, Harry
Ramsden's, the up-market fish-and-chips group, is planning to
expand into China next year.

Executive Chairman John Barnes says he is looking to open two or
three outlets there within two years and is considering Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou.

"Next year seems a marvellous time to expand out of Hong Kong into
China," he says.

Window has also learned that Harry Ramsden's has put in a bid for a
restaurant site at Chep Lap Kok airport, which it will operate as a
joint venture. This would be its second Hong Kong restaurant,
building on the success of the first one in Queen's Road East,
which is one of the most profitable in the group.

Its partner would probably be Compass Group, with which it already
operates a Harry Ramsden's at Heathrow airport, London.

Details of the proposed move into China are still being worked out,
says a spokesman for the group. They form part of an outside
feasibility study now nearing completion for a broad expansion at
home and abroad, heady stuff for a group that has grown from a dour
back street in a Yorkshire town to see its shares riding high on
the London Stock Exchange.

For Barnes, it just goes to show that what used to be thought of as
a very British acquired taste can tickle palates around the world.
He is sure that fish-and-chips will soon be as international as
hamburgers, pizza or sweet-and-sour pork.

Barnes is untroubled by any fears that Chinese officialdom might
view the advance of a British fish-and-chips chain as gastronomic
neo-colonialism, and put up obstacles.

"The Chinese love Western brand names," he says.

Besides that, Chinese diners rather like a touch of opulence - and
Harry Ramsden's, its trademark chandeliers, white tablecloths and
waiters belying the traditionally working-class fare of fish-and-
chips, is certainly posh, if not opulent.

"The restaurant in Hong Kong has been a huge success and it is
logical that we should capitalize on that," says Barnes.

At first, most of the customers in Hong Kong were expatriates.
These days, though, Chinese customers outnumber them three-to-one,
even though the menu holds only one rice dish.

New dish: Although fish-and chips is generally ranked with roast
beef and Yorkshire pudding as a classic British national dish the
combination is, in fact, relatively new.

Fried fish appears to have made its public debut as a convenience
food back in the London of the 1830s, at about the same time Queen
Victoria ascended the throne and the British Empire was stretching
its muscles around the world.

But according to Frying Tonight, a history of fish and chips, whose
unlikely author was the late BBC Religious Affairs correspondent
Gerald Priestland, chips did not appear until 50 years later when
Britain started importing deep-fryers from France.

For long years after that, until 1940, the throat-catching odour
from corner fish-and-chip shops, or "chippies" - also known in the
North of England as "chip oils" - caused their operation to be
officially designated "an offensive trade," along with blood-
boilers and gut-scrapers, respectively selling black sausage and
tripe-and-onions.

The pungent pong arose from undeodorized fats and cooking oils
bubbling away at often dangerously high temperatures (fish is best
deep-fried in beef dripping at about 200 C; the dripping catches
fire at 225 C.)

To stop the fish becoming fat-soaked it is first dipped in batter,
which also enhances the flavour and texture. Some fish-and-chip
shops claim to use special secret-ingredient batters like Colonel
Sanders' Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe.

Others, like Harry Ramsden's, put it all down to the freshness of
the fish and the quality of the potatoes.

British officialdom's disdain for fish-and-chips was abandoned at
the start of World War II when it was realized that here was a
wholesome, high-energy and relatively cheap dish, using local
resources and very suitable for consumption by a workforce whose
general health was vital to the success of the war effort.

Popular: The munching masses, anyway, had always ignored such
questions of image and continued to queue nightly to buy fish-and-
chips, smothered in salt and vinegar to kill the grease and wrapped
unhygienically in smudgy old newspaper.

This wrapping practice is a thing of the past since Britain entered
the squeaky-clean European Union. The bureaucrats in Brussels threw
up their hands (or maybe just threw up) at the idea of anyone
eating cod coated in printer's ink.

These days, many fish-and-chips shops in Britain are run by ethnic
minorities, including Chinese. The product is as popular as ever
despite its high calorie-count and the challenges of hamburgers,
fried chicken, Indian and Chinese foods, and pizza outlets which
have gobbled up large chunks of the mass market.

Few of today's "chippies" fry in the traditional beef dripping -
vegetable oil is cheaper and easier to manage, even though it lacks
the flavour.

But Harry Ramsden's has stuck with beef dripping. With fears of BSE
("mad cow disease") crossing from the bovine to the human
population, however, it has started importing dripping from Ireland
and Holland.

Harry Ramden's first restaurant opened in a back street of
Guiseley, near Leeds in Yorkshire, in 1929 and down the years
became a Mecca for lovers of succulent, fresh fish-and-chips.

On Saturday nights after the pubs closed Harry Ramsden would still
be frying well past midnight.

Today Harry's son, also Harry, aged 72, is a only a shareholder but
acts as a "travelling ambassador" for the group, which has 15
restaurants in major British cities. The notable and frustrating
exception is London; each time they find the right site in the
capital, someone else comes along and grabs it first.

Hong Kong is not the only overseas outlet. There are Harry Ramden's
in Tenerife, Dublin and Melbourne, too, all places that can boast a
British community or heritage.

Barnes thinks he might open 25 new restaurants in Britain by 2001,
possibly as franchises but with the group holding at least a 50 per
cent stake.

He is also contemplating sites in the Middle East, including
Jeddah, and would like to move into South Africa and New Zealand.

It was the brave flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 1989
that provided the funding and impetus for Harry Ramden's expansion.
It also won huge publicity for the group - which still had only one
shop at the time but was thinking big.

Since then, turnover and profits have risen on average by 20 per
cent a year.

This week shares in Harry Ramsden, launched at 100 pence (HK$12.34)
seven years ago, were trading at 375p after a high of 438p earlier
in the year. Market capitalization has risen from 4 million at
launch to more than 40 million.

Much of the success is down to (Michael) John Barnes, a man in
total contrast to the firm's late founder. At 47, and with a smile
as broad and gleaming as Labour leader Tony Blair's, he is the very
model of a modern chief executive.

When he took over Harry Ramsden's in 1988 via a new start-up
company, Barnes already had experience as a brand manager with
Procter and Gamble and had also worked for International Playtex
and PepsiCo and as managing director of the British end of Kentucky
Fried Chicken.

He has now led the company through seven years of consistent
earnings and earnings-per-share growth under the banner "The
World's Most Famous Fish and Chips." All has not been entirely
rosy, however.

Demand for fish-and-chips tends to be seasonal and was hit by the
hot summer in the UK last year, while margins in associated joint-
venture companies were trimmed by sharp increases in potato prices.

But the group has ventured out into instant fish-and-chip products
sold in supermarkets, and a joint venture to create a chain of
fish-and-chip takeaways under the Henry Higgins brand.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: REGION: Exports Stifled by World-Wide Malaise:
US slowdown affects Asian foreign trade 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By SUSAN FENTON, P.54-55

JAPANESE Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's re-election triumph on
Sunday may provide a much-needed boost for neighbouring Asian
exporters.

While the Liberal Democratic Party's tenuous majority initially
prompted a slide in the Japanese yen, some analysts see greater
political stability paving the way for sustainable economic
recovery in Japan that will boost demand for Asian goods and
strengthen the Japanese currency.

The yen has fallen 30 per cent in real terms against the US dollar
in the 12 months to June, making cheaper Japanese goods more
competitive vis-a-vis other Asian exports and exacerbating a slump
in the region's export performance since the start of the year.

"The year-over-year impact of depreciation has already started to
moderate and should reverse with yen strengthening expected in
1997," says Richard Ligon, an economist at UBS Securities. A
possible spending spree by Japanese consumers ahead of a planned
increase in sales tax from three per cent to five per cent in April
could also boost business for regional exporters.

The need: They certainly need it. After a boom year in 1995 that
saw nominal export growth exceed 20 per cent in most East and
Southeast Asian countries the same countries face single-digit
growth this year. South Korea, for example, will have to adjust
from 30 per cent export growth last year to 7.5 per cent this year,
to US$134.5 billion, recovering slightly to nine per cent in 1997,
predicts brokerage ING Barings.

"East Asia's surprisingly rapid deceleration of non-oil export
growth in recent months has exposed the region's continued
vulnerability to global supply/demand imbalances," says Ligon. He
doesn't foresee a real improvement until next year - helped by
accelerated growth in Europe - and then only a moderate one. "A
better picture will emerge in the second quarter of next year," he
says. "There will be a recovery, yes, but not a boom like the
levels seen in 1995."

Hindering a significant improvement in the short term is a
continued downturn in the electronics sector and recent data from
the US pointing to slower-than-expected growth in the US economy.

"The US remains the critical factor for a regional upturn in export
growth," says Barings in a report. Recent data is in line with
analysts estimates that US economic growth slowed to around two per
cent in the third quarter, down from 4.7 per cent in the second
quarter.

Barings, however, points out that there are already signs that
inventory stockpiles in the US, which have curbed import demand,
are now being depleted and renewed orders for manufacturing goods
will prompt a pick-up in imports in the final quarter of this year.
"The notable exception remains the electronics sector, which is
still undergoing consolidation and is not expected to see a marked
recovery until at least the first half of 1997," says the
brokerage.

While this is bad news for the region as a whole, Singapore, which
depends on electronics for 51 per cent of its non-oil exports, and
South Korea, where the sector accounts for 35 per cent of exports,
stand to suffer most. "Singapore and Korea have been hard hit by
the downturn in the electronics cycle and that will continue for a
few quarters," says George Leung, economic adviser at HSBC Markets.

Singapore's non-oil exports slid an unexpectedly high 6.2 per cent
year-on-year in nominal terms in September to S$7.31 billion,
following a 6.3 per cent drop in August.

Korea, which is also hardest hit by a weak yen, saw its exports
fall 8.1 per cent year-on-year in September, to US$10.1 billion.
HSBC Markets, however, says that new measures introduced by the
Finance Ministry to help cut manufacturing production costs,
including slashing domestic steel prices and reducing prices of
government land for factories, should in the longer term help make
exports more competitive.

The impact of the downturn in the electronics sector, largely the
result of excess inventory build-up in the US, is now being felt by
Malaysia as easing demand spreads beyond D-RAM prices to
peripherals and related industries.

The electronic components industry, much of it shifted from higher
cost Singapore, generates 27 per cent of Malaysia's non-oil exports
and has helped it consistently achieve export growth of between 17
and 26 per cent over the past three years. The slowdown this year,
will result in a meagre 9.1 per cent increase in Malaysian exports,
to $80.8 billion, and 10.5 per cent next year.

Good for some: In contrast, the outlook for the Philippines is
promising. Analysts generally agree that it is set to produce the
strongest export performance in Southeast Asia this year, on 15.8
per cent growth to $20.1 billion according to Barings, and in 1997,
on 16 per cent growth. "As the Philippines produces very low-tech
products such as consumer electronics like television sets and
radios, it suffers little impact from a downturn in the cycle,"
says Leung. Growth rates are still well down from last year's peak
of 29 per cent, though, partly because of year-on-year declines in
sales of traditional exports like textiles, coconut oil and
footwear.

The only other country in the region expected to post double-digit
export growth this year is Indonesia, with Barings forecasting an
11.4 per cent increase in exports to $50.6 billion.

Indonesia is something of the odd-one-out among East and Southeast
Asian nations, as the only one not to enjoy an export boom last
year nor suffer a slump this year - mainly because its exports are
raw materials, making it less exposed to the global business cycle.
"In that sense, Indonesia's backwardness has been a help," says
Dominique Maire of UBS Securities in Singapore.

If that is the case, does it follow that as Asian nations are
moving into increasingly sophisticated areas of manufacturing,
export growth of 25-30 per cent a year is a thing of the past?

Not necessarily, says Ligon. "The era of export-led growth in East
Asia is not over, but it is changing," he says.

Increasing competition from lower-cost countries means erstwhile
sources of cheap labour like Thailand and Indonesia are having to
shift to producing higher value-added goods in the way that Hong
Kong and Singapore did before them. But that is not automatically
depressing their export performance. Indonesia, which has started
to reduce its dependence on textiles and plywood by producing raw
material-based but value-added products, is enjoying a mini boom,
doubling sales of paper products this year and increasing exports
of industrial chemicals by more than 50 per cent and glass and
ceramics by more than 20 per cent. The Malaysian Government is
promoting investment in the more cyclical hi-tech sector.

Thailand, however, has yet to make the switch. "The most worrying
country is Thailand," says Maire. "It has had the worst export
slump and requires investment in higher-value added products
because it is losing its lower cost competitiveness." HSBC Markets
adds that it also needs to invest in human resources, including
comprehensive training programmes, to boost export competitiveness.
"The government has also pledged that it will focus on enhancing
Thailand's export competitiveness by cutting tariffs for imports
and on raw materials for export-oriented products," says HSBC.

"It will, however, take a long time before these measures come into
effect." Barings sees

Thai export growth plunging to a meagre 5.2 per cent this year, to
$58.4 billion, from 23.6 per cent last year.

"Until evidence of an export turnaround is apparent, Thailand will
remain the lacklustre story of Asean," says Barings. Asean
comprises Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Like its neighbours, however, Thailand still stands to benefit from
rapidly expanding demand for exports from within Asia itself. "The
manufacturing boom owes much to Japanese investment, which has
facilitated the growth of intra-regional trade," says Ligon.

He notes that intra-Asean trade, for example, accounted for about a
fifth of Southeast Asian exports over the past three years, but
contributed more than a quarter of total growth.

Last year's export peak and this year's slump were both cyclical,
triggered by weak global demand, says Ligon. "Strong foreign direct
investment flows supporting manufacturing growth have not subsided,
and export growth is now coming chiefly from within the Asian
region," he says.

"These factors will provide a substantial cushion to Asian
exporters as they contend with rising costs and new competition."

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TAXATION: Tax Reforms Take Toll On PRC
Companies: Revenue men get more efficient 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By TIM WILSON, P.53

THEY were down but never out, and now they are clawing their way
back. China's central tax returns have been rising consistently
since the tax system underwent a major revamp in 1994. No more the
wilting remittances that shrank the tax revenue from 35 per cent of
GDP in 1979 to 15 per cent in 1993. Last week the central
government released the figures for the industrial and commercial
receipts for the first nine months of this year. They are up again
- by 20 per cent. And this comes at a time when the economy is
supposed to have slowed down.

According to the figures, 249.8 billion yuan went into central
government coffers for the period from January to September - a
year-on-year rise of 19.6 per cent. And local governments raised
203.1 billion, 22.9 per cent more than this time last year.
Although the Chinese economy has grown at a rate only slightly
below this, the increase, say analysts, is largely attributable to
the reforms of two years ago - and it is a measure of their
success. "Since 1994, the policy framework has been set," says Qu
Hong Bing of UBS Securities, "but in terms of implementation, it's
a gradual process." The effects of this mean different things to
different people.

Networking: The process has involved the setting up of a national
tax collection network. Prior to the reform, provinces submitted
tax, which they collected, on a contractual basis. Since then, the
various taxes, and the responsibility for collecting them, have
been divided up between local and national collection agencies. To
achieve this, local bureaus were effectively split in half to
accommodate the new national ones. It is a change which presented
many logistical difficulties, not least of which was the job of
recruiting and training a large intake of staff. This took time, as
has the task of delineating more clearly the roles of the national
and local bureaus.

But the reforms are taking hold. Add to this the fact that the
government has been taking serious steps to chase up tax evaders
and to put an end to the contractual arrangements that have tended
to operate between individual companies and local tax bureaus, and
you have a situation where the fiscal net is noticeably tightening.

The central government will be gratified to have rationalized the
tax system, and to have ensured itself a more reliable source of
income with which to make a dent in the budget deficit, which came
in at 66 billion yuan last year. There is still the nagging problem
of intergovernmental transfers, however, which means that the
centre is obliged to give up the bulk of its receipts to subsidize
poorer provinces. But overall the indicators are favourable.

Nonetheless, if central and local governments are increasing their
revenue, it does mean that somebody else is paying the price.
Although China's tax regime has been and remains low in
international terms, companies in the country have been finding
themselves saddled with new and larger bills. Firms are getting
away with less, and this has had its own effects.

For local companies, says Chen Xingdong of Crosby Securities, it
was a contributing factor in this year's poor interim results.
"These were awful," he says, "and it is true to say that the tax
increase has been greater than economic growth. And you can add to
this that VAT is a turnover tax, not a profit tax. They pay VAT as
long as they make the product. These enterprises that are unable to
sell, still have to pay the tax." VAT was one of the cornerstones
of the reform. Nevertheless, penalizing overproducers is not
necessarily a bad thing.

Foreign woes: Foreign-invested enterprises are also getting caught
in the net. Many of them, says Tsang Shu-ki of Hong Kong's Baptist
University, were in the habit of bargaining for a lump sum tax
submission on a contractual basis. "They are under pressure to
eliminate that practice, and I know that some FIEs are complaining.
I hear that in the Pearl River Delta life is much more difficult."

And in general terms, the FIEs will be contributing an increasing
proportion to government coffers, not only because the collection
process is being revamped. The drop in the rate of VAT refund for
exporters - it stood at 17 per cent in the middle of last year and
now stands at nine - would not feature on these tax returns
announced by the government, for the simple reason that it
qualifies as an expenditure. Nor, as yet, will the ending of duty-
free machinery imports, which does not really take effect until the
grace period ends in December of this year. But both of these will
have significant consequences both for government revenue and
company burdens.

A recent report by the Economist Intelligence Unit argued that
these new measures were also playing a big role in keeping property
prices down. The higher costs of doing business lower net operating
incomes and hence market values. And this phenomenon is worsened by
the government's success at controlling inflation, to the point
where the cost of credit in the country has actually entered
positive territory.

So you have the ironic situation where improving macroeconomic and
budgetary controls - both positive signs - are actually depressing
the property market and stopping investors in their tracks. The
government urgently needs to increase revenue, but companies in
China could do without the uncertainty this brings.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: PROFILE: Strategic Advances in Financial
Marketing: Richard Tsang outlines new firm's role 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By CATHY HOLCOMBE, P.52

CREATIVE and outgoing, fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English,
PR operative Richard Tsang represents the ideal local manager for
international firms.

In an age when such firms are increasingly dependent on the
cultural and language skills of native executives, he also
represents their worst fears. For like many local directors who
learned the ropes in industries dominated by multinationals, he
broke away to found his own firm.

After building up Edelman Public Relations financial relations
team, Tsang left 15 months ago to form Strategic Financial
Relations Ltd, taking two senior account executives with him.

Strategic is one of four companies in a group representing a new,
homegrown force in political and media relations: the three others
are run respectively by politico C.K. Lo; radio personality Andy
Ho; and former Burson-Marsteller director Sam Lam, who merged with
Wendy Hughes to form a China relations counselling group.

Tsang took several senior account managers with him when he left
Edelman, but he did not storm off with a load of clients in tow.
"We only had three or four clients when we started," he says.

Following: Some of his clients have since trailed him, while others
turned to his custom-tailored services to handle new listings.
Besides special projects work, these days Strategic has 17 retainer
clients, mostly small and medium-sized companies that count on
Tsang's team to do everything from clipping newspaper articles to
writing annual reports, to arranging road shows or media tours.

The most important role Tsang plays is in making sure his clients
have investor followings.

If you're not a blue chip, it can be hard to get attention in Hong
Kong's family of nearly 500 listed companies. All his clients,
whether they've seen their share price fall or rise in the last
year, have healthy followings by local brokerage houses. Two of
them, leather trader Dah Hwa Holdings and plastics maker Ngai Hing
Hong, enjoyed share price growth of more than 500 per cent last
year.

"We don't tell people how to invest. We help people meet," the
energetic Tsang explains from his sunny office in Admiralty Centre.
"For low-profile, smaller companies, they may not know how to find
the fund managers and  analysts."

He points to the example of tissue paper maker Dransfield. Analysts
had a hard time getting too excited about the company that makes
tissue on behalf of Tempo, those packets snatched up for just over
$2 at any newsstand or kiosk.

But the company had plans to create its own brand. Tsang put
executives in touch with analysts who decided such a move was worth
funding and a Nasdaq placement was made, raising money as well as
exciting movement in the company's shares.

"You've got to feed [analysts] as much information as possible,"
explains Tsang. "And get them out for visits whenever possible."

Lively and loquacious, there are few subjects Tsang will not hold
court on. He is bashful in one area, however. Asked his age, Tsang
pauses before revealing the figure with a shy laugh: he is 30 years
old, a fact generally greeted with gasps of surprise.

"People guess I'm something like 38," Tsang says. "I remember all
those nights I never left the office until midnight. I say even if
[chronologically] I'm 30, I'm equal to a 38-year-old in work
years."

Tsang is the epitome of a generation which came of age at a time
when the price tag for the skills of locals began to match and then
overtake demand for expatriate talent.

He moved quickly up the career ladder at Burson-Marsteller, his
second place of employment after earning a communications degree
from the Chinese University, and later held a lead position at
Edelman.

A little serendipity also didn't hurt his advancement. When Tsang
was first transferred to Burson-Marsteller's financial relations
team in 1990, the ho-hum department had few business-specialist
media or even brokerages to whom it could disseminate company
profiles. But within three years IPO fever had gripped the local
bourse, brokerages were flooding the territory and local papers
were spawning expanded financial sections.

Today he has a data base of between 2,000 and 3,000 brokers,
bankers and media contacts. Most of his senior account executives
come not from a PR background, but from brokerages and banks.

Tsang waves away suggestions that breakaways by crucial local
executives are international firms' worst nightmares these days.

"It's not like the whole company left with me," he says. He simply
found his own little niche.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: INVESTMENT: China Tops Survey of Best Emerging
Markets: Asia heads money-spinning opportunities 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.50-51

A MAJOR new survey into investment opportunities in emerging
markets world-wide has rated China as the most attractive of
developing economies, with others Asian countries judged to be
among the best of the rest.

The report suggests that more than three-quarters of companies with
international operations are now investing in emerging markets as
they compete to make the most of liberal trade policies adopted
following the demise of state-controlled economies.

But though it evaluates where the greatest rewards are to be had,
the study from Control Risks Group, an international political and
business risk consultancy, also highlights the problems and
concerns facing investors.

Based on 100 telephone interviews with managers specifically
responsible for their company's overseas operations, the survey
covers 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and eastern
Europe.

Leading: Asia dominates the report's top 10, with China heading the
league on a score of 7.2 out of 10 - the rating being an expression
of both the opportunities on offer and the pros and cons of the
operating environment.

Not that investment in China is a bed of roses, says the report,
suggesting that worries over the eventual succession to Deng
Xiaoping prompt concern about the time frame within which the
mainland will justify expectations.

The study also details worries about the Chinese legal system,
corruption, intellectual copyright, counterfeiting, theft, break-
ins and whether rural areas will fulfill their potential.

Yet despite the hitches, China has one unbeatable advantage: sheer
market size. With 1.2 billion inhabitants, it emerges as way ahead
of the pack in offering the most exciting opportunities for
business expansion.

"China's scale alone justifies the number-one spot," says Boris
Starling of CRG's business development department. "And were it not
for reasonably high risks, it could have scored a perfect 10."

Rating some distance behind China are three more Asian countries.
Malaysia ranks second in the survey because of confidence in its
"stable and focused political institutions" - although growth has
slowed and the economy remains  relatively small.

Third is Indonesia, with investors wowed by an impressive growth
record. CRG experts, however, express "concerns over the next
political succession" in a country where "politics and business
have been traditionally intertwined."

Next comes India, scoring points for its huge market potential and
ongoing transition to an open economy. Only continuing worries over
bureaucracy and infrastructure and the fact that it starts from a
lower base prevent India from ranking higher.

Thailand ranks sixth, "current political wobbles" not having dimmed
confidence, according to the report, although concern over wage
rates, skills and infrastructure could see some investors shift to
Vietnam.

Punctuating Asia's dominance of the top 10 are Brazil in fifth,
strong on communications, energy, infrastructure and the extractive
sector, and eastern Europe's two brightest prospects - the Czech
Republic (joint sixth and well on course for convergence with the
EU) and Poland, placed eighth despite the rise of neo-communism.

South Africa, where economic success has outlived initial euphoria
over Nelson Mandela's coming to power, stands alone in ninth, with
Argentina, Chile and the Gulf States all tied in 10th.

The most notable absentee from the upper reaches of the list is
Russia, rating only 20th, partly because of problems with organized
crime, inadequate legislation and political instability, but mainly
because of an overall failure to "turn potential into concrete
commitments."

However, Boris Yeltsin's re-election convinced 62 per cent of
respondents that opportunities would increase over the next five
years, although India rates top in this respect with fully 81 per
cent expecting an improvement.

Other Asian countries were among those which, like Russia, rated
not so highly, but were expected to offer more in the future -
predictions not always endorsed by CRG.

The authorities in Vietnam will currently allow investment only on
their terms, and the situation is likely to prevail, yet 67 per
cent of those polled thought prospects would improve, especially in
infrastructure and energy.

Burma, according to 11 per cent of respondents, will also show
improvements, but CRG warns against over-optimism. It suggests that
"blindness to the political consequences" of operating there could
leave companies open to "consumer boycotts and even lawsuits."

For Cambodia, 39 per cent of investors predicted better prospects
in five years' time, prompting CRG to caution that "there is little
evidence to suggest" it "will emerge as a productive business
environment."

Asian economics apart, respondents rated the Baltic states (53 per
cent) and some parts of the former Yugoslavia (38 per cent) as the
poor performers most likely to show improved opportunities.

The CRG's ratings and predictions are based on a survey carried out
on its behalf by the Industrial Research Bureau in June. The IRB
chose, at random, 100 of the 500 biggest companies with a presence
in Britain and operating internationally.

Sectors covered included aerospace, brewing, chemicals,
commodities, communications, construction, electricity,
engineering, food manufacturing, health, hotels, insurance, media,
metals, mines, paper, tobacco, transport and water.

Managers completed questionnaires asking them to rate the emerging
markets in which they operated in terms of opportunities and
prospects, fears and concerns, trade barriers, local partners and
other factors.

CRG collated the results, analyzed and evaluated them. The
resultant report, it says, is relevant to any business - Western or
otherwise - which has dealings in emerging markets.

Says Starling: "Our conclusions are based on the experiences of
British companies, but the rules apply across the board. I expect
the findings will be studied especially hard by people in east
Asia, who are always very careful."

The country rankings apart, the report's real value is likely to be
in pointing out the problems faced by those investing in developing
economics - and in evaluating whether common fears are real or
misplaced.

CRG head of research David Battman cites the main challenges to
such companies as "adjusting to often ambiguous business and
political environments, and combating problems of corruption and
organized criminal activity."

According to the survey, the greatest concerns of respondents are
political stability and the security situation. But CRG claims that
the security threat is often overestimated and "can be managed,"
whereas the degree of political instability is "crucial."

Environmental and democracy issues are regarded as much lower
concerns, but this, says CRG, underestimates their importance, as
they can lead to global repercussions such as boycotts and
insurance withdrawals.

The report also reveals that two-thirds of investors favour a local
partnership, but that at least 37 per cent experience some kind of
serious problem with their newly established joint venture.

In Guangdong, for example, it claims that foreign executives "are
far more concerned by possible 'official' abduction on behalf of a
powerful local partner than by the greatly exaggerated threat of
kidnap by common criminals."

However, CRG asserts that though businesses are right to worry
about fraudulent activity and criminal connections when selecting
partners, they should pay more attention to their political
connections.

This was highlighted recently in Russia, it says, when a number of
companies found that their local associates went Awol as they
jockeyed for patronage prior to June's presidential elections.

On top: Control Risks is, though, keen to stress that it regards
few problems as insurmountable.

"Some surveys just look at potential," says Starling. "That means
that people get paranoid when problems emerge. But we try to
evaluate both risk and opportunity - and we are able to help when
things go wrong."

CRG's 3,500 clients in more than 130 countries can draw on any of
its four main divisions: political and security risk analysis,
which compiled the report; confidential investigation, handling
problems including fraud; security consultancy, which provides
advice and, if necessary, men on the ground; and crisis response,
which helps firms cope with emergencies such as kidnap and
extortion.

The latter role betrays CRG's origins: its original incarnation was
as an adjunct to the corporate kidnap and ransom insurance policy
at Lloyd's of London. From that four-man operation it has expanded
to 160 staff in 11 offices world-wide.

The ending of the Cold War and collapse of old power blocs has
hastened CRG's rise, with companies presented with new
opportunities and new dangers - although Starling argues that the
problems of dealing with developing nations have been exaggerated.

"People seem to think that things are more dangerous than they used
to be," he says. "But that's not necessarily the case. Very often
you're talking about dangers in countries where a few years ago
opportunities did not exist al all."

Control Risk is, for example, aiding several businesses in Algeria,
which some consider perilous, while only Bosnia and Afghanistan
have ever been declared unsafe, and then solely in times of war.

"North Korea is perhaps the last closed state in terms of
politics," adds Starling. "And people are even trying to go there."

Ironically, while CRG finds that investors often magnify problems
encountered on the ground, it concludes that they are often
alarmingly blind to bigger threats.

"The world is wide open at the moment," says Starling. "But there
is nothing to say that it won't close up somewhat again in the
future. We're already seeing the return of communist regimes in
some areas, but businessmen seem to think that the clock can never
turn back."

He adds: "Neither will companies from developed countries have it
all their own way for long. There are going to be big firms from,
for example, Russia, China and Brazil coming along, and they won't
be subject to the same constraints as today's investors."

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TECHNOLOGY: Taking the Hi-tech Road: Government
centre nurtures real-time IT research 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BRIAN TRUSCOTT, P.48-49

FINATECH Ltd - a self-described financial engineering and risk
management company pushing the envelope on real-time information
technology - could be considered one of Hong Kong's showcase
efforts to create what many believe is a much-needed but under-
developed, hi-tech sector.

The consensus is that Hong Kong has succeeded in making the decade-
long transition from a manufacturing base to a service-oriented
centre; services now comprise 83 per cent of gross domestic
product, while manufacturing has shrunk to 9.3 per cent this year
from 20 per cent of GDP just five years ago.

A key player in this transition has been the financial sector,
although people employed in wholesale/import and export still
dominate the sector; finance and insurance make up only  about 19
per cent of Hong Kong's total services industry.

Nevertheless, if a company such as FinaTech can be given the
fiscal, managerial and networking wherewithal, then perhaps Hong
Kong can be successful in launching some semblance of a sector
dependent on hi-tech R&D.

Second centre: The 235,000 sq ft Hong Kong Industrial Technology
Centre, which the government built in 1994 in Kowloon Tong for $250
million, is the forerunner of what is to be a second technology
centre. Price tag: about $500 million for a 350,000 sq ft centre to
be operating by 1999. Chief Executive Officer Dr James Liu says
these centres will probably show how a government can "simply
create an industry."

Liu says 45 companies will have set up shop by next year, and that
the addition of a new centre means more than 100 tech-based
companies will be operating under the umbrella of the HKITC by the
end of the decade.

FinaTech is currently just one of 20 fledgling companies so far in-
house. Company founder Eric Wong hopes his firm can benefit from a
local derivatives market that could and should flourish in coming
years - given the territory's tax structure, ease of trading, it
being a strong financial community already delving into the
fledgling exotics market and, as always, its proximity to China.

And this minnow - which originally started operations in Wong's
flat - has succeeded in attracting some significant partners,
specifically Reuters. The news giant recently gave FinaTech third-
party development rights, after initially being interested in the
company's 1993 prototype, Risk Rider, a program designed to keep
track of Hang Seng Index Options.

"FinaTech is the only financial engineering firm in Hong Kong that
has joined the Reuters Application Development Programme," says
Wong. The company is now in negotiations to perhaps include the
company's increasing number of financial software applications for
risk management in conjunction with Reuters' products - a move that
would save it expensive marketing and training costs.

The initial marriage between FinaTech and the HKITC started in May
1995, a few years after Wong and partner Arthur Man started looking
for potential business niches in the territory's growth in
financial instruments - options, warrants and various other
derivatives and exotics.

He says Hong Kong's derivatives market - in a holding pattern since
the mid-1980s - has only recently started to take off, gaining
momentum since 1992 when volume and liquidity started to fuel
growth. Business looks brighter now that brokerages have benefited
from a fat year in dealing with the booming market.

Wong has surrounded himself with a number of consultants well
versed in finance, marketing, mathematics and software expertise;
unlike other traders he has worked with in the past as a trader at
Citibank, Wardley James Capel and Credit Lyonnais, his sideline
interests in software applications and writing have led him into
the field he describes as financial engineering.

Wong's oft-published commentaries in such publications as Asia Risk
and the Hong Kong Economic Times as well as his seminars and
teaching have forged contacts and business for FinaTech. His
activities have also helped fund an enterprise that has surpassed
the $5 million mark in start-up funds.

By placing himself at the heart of Hong Kong's expanding
derivatives market, he has also been instrumental in bridging the
gap between the West's sometimes opaque options market for Chinese
brokers, again by giving seminars, lectures and writing books
(Options: a Primer with Professor Raymond Chiang in 1993, for
example).

"There has been trouble in the past in finding Cantonese [and
Mandarin] speakers on the subject; I have invented many of the
financial terms in Chinese," he says, adding that language skills
have helped set up initial ties with the Shenzhen and Shanghai
markets - another fount of business opportunities in the future, he
hopes.

While a handful of those also in residence at HKITC are financial
information-based ventures, the others comprise a variety of hi-
tech enterprises. Liu expects a number of them to flourish once
their initial three-year "incubation" period is completed - after
which time, they have to leave and "enter the real world."

The director describes those 1,100 days as a sort of "MBA on the
job," as the centre ensures that the company - apart from
developing the core business - learns an array of managerial,
marketing and networking skills.

There is also seed money involved, to the tune of $1 or $2 million
initially being doled out from HKITC's $50 million annual budget.
Companies which continue to expand are earmarked for additional
capital and, finally, a concerted move to attract local or
international venture capital if a company and its business ideas
continue to attract interest.

Besides FinaTech, Liu points at other HKITC occupants for bigger
things to come - SuperLogic Communications, for example.

The company is developing FaxMail, multi-networking systems and
Internet applications. Company representatives say that computer
fax means "directly sending and receiving a facsimile through the
computer." But in a local area network, one PC must be dedicated as
the fax server and a fax card must be installed.

"The key feature is the fax LAN software which controls the
hardware," says a company spokesman. Hence, its FaxMail component
is merging fax technology with LAN technology, highly useful where
there is heavy fax traffic.

The hope is that such companies will do what traditional
manufacturing-based middlemen did for Hong Kong years ago: attract
business and technological exchange from foreign multinationals as
well as China-based companies.

Nevertheless, Liu believes Hong Kong's hi-tech development will be
unique, unlike a Taiwan, Singapore or South Korea. Research and
development, he says, fuels any hi-tech venture. Liu says Hong Kong
will be used as a managerial storefront operation: financial
strategists and policy makers located here, with most of the
labour, both R&D and production, eventually being carried out in
China, or more specifically, the Pearl River Delta.

The reason is simple. China is starting to churn out well-trained
engineers in increasing numbers; a company can hire five or six
PRC-based engineers for the price of one Hong Kong engineer. Given
that China is just 40 minutes away, Liu believes Hong Kong's
comparative advantage will ensure that the hi-tech sector continues
to grow; China's elephantine presence beside mouse-like Hong Kong
also makes a consistently compelling argument.

It's interesting to note how Wong and Liu come to the same
conclusion about why Hong Kong has only recently seen the
development of a credible hi-tech industry.

Liu says that while entrepreneurs have the drive and a fundamental
grounding in various hi-tech disciplines, the underlying focus or
initiatives did not truly exist in Hong Kong until this decade,
when the government started making fiscal overtures for the
creation of a hi-tech sector.

Liu says the networking potential, seed money and simple policy
direction instilled by the government acts as a catalyst for
businessmen wanting to enter Hong Kong's hi-tech sector.

Formula: Wong says it has taken a number of synergies, such as
software knowledge and stockbroking expertise, to create useful
real-time risk management products for market players. That
combined with what the HKITC provides - everything from cheap rent,
cost-free air conditioning, free access to seminar rooms to
international trade junkets such as the one last month to Seattle,
where the itinerary included visits to Boeing and Microsoft -
suggests a winning formula.

Liu also suggests that Hong Kong entrepreneurs remain focused on
southern China, Hong Kong's true hinterland. Currently, Hong Kong
manufacturers employ fewer than 400,000 people in the territory,
but more than 3 million in China. That disparity should continue to
grow simply because Guangdong province - as well as the potential
business from two new railroads between Hong Kong and Beijing - is
a gold mine waiting to be exploited, he says.

"And why be greedy? There's enough in the Pearl Delta for
everyone," he says, conceding that for the moment, growth in the
province looks flat. "Guangdong is like Hong Kong 10 or 15 years
ago; you have to transform yourself and you need time for that."

AROUND TOWN: Ascending the Peak on: Double 9, circa 1930 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE "Double Ninth" was originally the Day for Climbing the Hills,
the festival when all good Chinese believed they must visit high
places. Today, the pragmatic Cantonese combine it with the Ch'ung
Yeung - the Autumn Festival, when ancestral graves are visited,
swept clean, and offerings placed on the graves (similar to the
Ch'ing Ming Festival in the spring). In North China, the two
festivals are observed separately.

The origin of the "Climbing the Hills" festival is obscure, but is
reputed to have originated during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-224 AD),
when a virtuous scholar was advised to ascend the mountain with his
family in order to escape an impending disaster.

Visiting and attending to the graves of the departed ones is an
extension of the all-important tenet of ancestral worship, serving
also as welcome family reunions.

The photograph shows a long procession of people ascending the
Peak, on Hong Kong Island. The small building, in the centre of the
photograph, is the gatehouse of the Governor's Peak residence -the
Mountain Lodge. The gatehouse is still standing, but the Mountain
Lodge was demolished after World War II, and a public pavilion
built on its site.

Several sedan chairs can be seen in the centre, waiting for
customers, and a few can be seen ascending with the crowd. Under a
temporary cover, refreshments are being sold to the thirsty
climbers.

AROUND TOWN: CHESS 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By CHEUK BO-YAN

China did well again at the Chess Olympics (this year in Yerevan,
Armenia) although the 13th place with 32.5 points (of 114 teams) in
the men section may not satisfy everyone back home. A few poor
results in the last few rounds was almost negated by an emphatic 3-
1 win over Belarus (with Boris Gelfand) in the last round. Still,
on rating China was only placed 30 at the start of this spectacular
biennial event. The other strongest Australasian nations finished
as follows: 19th Uzbekistan (32 points), 26th Philippines, 27th
Vietnam and 28th Australia (all 31 points), 30th Kazakhstan and
39th Turkmenistan (both 30.5), while Indonesia came 44th on 29.5
points. The small number of points difference indicates the
unreasonableness of the Swiss system being used, and at the same
time the importance of scoring well in rounds 12, 13 and 14; this
is often more of a lottery than a real draw. One of the PRC men
team's finer wins occurred in round 3 against Hungary with 3-1.
They then briefly occupied first spot ahead of Cuba, and even
consolidated this next round by beating Castro's team by 2.5-1.5;
the eventual winners Russia overtook them then by a hard-fought
2.5-1.5 result in round 5. Here the two games that showed that
China are on the right track. Hungary were rated third and gold-
medal winners in 1978. Peng Xiaomin on board 3 contained Zoltan
Almasi, while Zhang Zhong on board 4 also drew with up-and-coming
17 year old GM Peter Leko (see also next week). On board 1, GM Ye
Jiangchuan is still very much improving, probably because he
currently plays from Amsterdam as his base. Here he outlasted Judit
Polgar rated 10th in the world, and the strongest female player
ever. Of course he has met her many times before. White - Polgar

his own games in his study. White - Wang Black - Portisch

AROUND TOWN: BRIDGE 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PHILLIP ALDER, P.46

Last September, as we left a restaurant, my wife spotted the club
four on the floor by the door. (She's poetic, my wife.) When we got
home I looked in Right Through the Pack by Robert Darvas and Norman
de Villiers Hart. The deal related by the club four features
Sherlock Holmes. And, as the detective nearly said, "Come, reader,
come! The game is afoot."

West leads the spade four: five, seven, king. Declarer plays a low
diamond to dummy's jack. After winning with the queen, East
switches to the heart king. Declarer wins with the ace, cashes the
ace-king of diamonds and exits with the club four. West wins with
the ace, but South has the rest of the tricks - and 11 in all -
with the spade ace, the queen-jack of hearts and his four diamonds.
What is the contract?

Don't be misled by my auction, which reaches the right final
contract, not the one in the book.

The first deduction you should make is that diamonds are trumps.
Otherwise, after West won trick six, declarer couldn't claim four
more diamond tricks as he has no side-suit hand entry remaining.

So, is the contract five diamonds? No, because then South couldn't
afford the safety-play in diamonds, which guarantees only one trump
loser against a 4-0 split. For all he knows, West has the heart
king, and he will lose three tricks even if diamonds are 2-2 or 3-1
with a singleton queen. Could it be three diamonds? No, because
then South doesn't need the safety-play. Therefore, the contract
must be four diamonds. For the rest of the tale, buy the book.

Rossini

Peches de Vieillesse

Frederic Chiu

Harmonia Mundi France 907102

With his superlative technical facility, Chinese-American Pianist
Frederic Chiu could be a piano virtuoso of the old school. But
Rossini's Sins of Old Age and Liszt's arrangement of the overture
to William Tell are perhaps too similar in content and style to
reveal the man behind the notes.

It's not easy to convey the irony and humour of Rossini's little
indulgences for keyboard, written 30 years after he had finished
writing operas.

The composer evidently intended the 150 or so little pieces to be
frivolities, but Chiu's general demeanour tends towards the
pedantic and he adopts a kind of mock morose approach for the start
of each piece, which effectively torpedoes the music from the
outset. All seven pieces sound too similar.

Liszt's William Tell piano arrangement also misses, another
indication Chiu lacks the range to convey the symphonic original.

REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM: Costner Proves A Winner on Links: Tin Cup 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

Director Ron Shelton

Starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin.

It would. seem that if you want to make a movie about sport in
Hollywood these days, you have to call Ron Shelton - who went
against cinema tradition and managed to make a film about baseball
that wasn't a flop (Bull Durham).

He also put together the charming basketball comedy White Men Can't
Jump, and the much misunderstood tale of the embittered major
league baseball legend Cobb.

In Tin Cup Shelton turns his attention to that most sedentary of
sports, golf.

Golf, by it's very nature, is not given to frenetic moments. It is
a ponderous and deliberate game, a game for those who like to
consider all the ramifications before making a decision, a game for
those who enjoy a wander near woods and lakes while the sun slowly
goes down.

And it is exactly this leisurely, relaxed atmosphere that Tin Cup
manages to capture while at the same time providing the beleaguered
Kevin Costner with the kind of role he was born to play. Costner
has too soft a face to pull off post apocalyptic warriors
(Waterworld) or mucho macho mediaeval outlaws (Robin Hood Prince of
Thieves).

In such overblown epics as these his lost-little-boy persona
becomes swamped and we lose sight of just how charismatic, in a
"gorgeous boy next door" kind of way Costner is.

Costner also excels in a role with humour. As he had begun to view
himself as a "serious" film-maker since his success with Dances
With Wolves, he has recently nixed humorous scripts. One supposes
that the trauma of Waterworld saw him just desperate to take on
more light-hearted projects.

And light-hearted (delightfully so) Tin Cup most certainly is.
Costner plays Roy McAvoy, a naturally gifted player who just
couldn't take himself seriously enough to make it as a pro. He can
drive like Daly, and putt like Faldo. If he could only do it on a
more regular basis, he would be up there with the best. But to be a
top golfer requires an enormous amount of dedication and
concentration, and Roy just doesn't possess those qualities.

Like a wayward Steve Ballasteros, Roy also has a penchant for the
spectacular, going for a birdie where he should take a par,
refusing to play a percentage game, even though a percentage game
might bring him success and riches.

Glory shots and entertainmen - that, for Roy, is what the sport is
about.

But now his tournament days are behind him, and Roy has settled
down into a life of middle-aged indolence. He owns a run-down
driving range in Nowhereseville Texas, where he gives the odd
lesson in between drinking beers with his mates.

It looks like Roy will make his way to the grave in such fashion,
until he is shaken out of his complacency by Dr Molly Griswold and
David Simms (Rene Russo and Don Johnson).

The former tickles his fancy, the latter, an old golfing chum who
is now a slick pro, hurts his pride by asking him to caddie in a
major competition.

Sure enough, Roy rises to both challenges, but, thank goodness,
does so in unpredictable fashion. He refuses to be tamed, either by
Molly, who would have him "extend his follow-through" a little
(what's the point of making a sport's movie if you can't use the
sport's terms for a little double entendre?) - or by David, who
smugly insists that the only way to win is to take the percentage
shot. Instead, Roy goes all out to win, both his lady and the golf
game of his life, on his own terms.

The movie delights in watching Roy take on the challenge of
seducing '90s woman and psychologist Molly in an old-fashioned way,
and in its climactic scenes, manages to instil more excitement and
tension in a fictional golf match than I have ever seen in a real
one. By the time its climax comes around, the movie becomes a real
nail- biter.

Director Shelton hasn't had a big hit in a while now, but with this
movie, and with Costner at his very best, he looks set to win
worldwide. What is more, by making his heroines intelligent and
full of character he is set to explode the myth that only bimbos
follow sport.

Dr Molly in this movie is as quick-witted and pithy as Susan
Sarandon was in Bull Durham.

It is Molly who provides Roy with the key to success thanks to her
superior understanding of his character. No cheerleader this lady.

All in all, a smart, exciting, character-driven comedy that should
keep everyone, golf fan or not, thoroughly entertained. Even if you
hate the game, you should try to take this charmer in.

REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM/Martin Snape: DeNiro Is Up and Down in Thriller:
The Fan 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.44-45

Director: Tony Scoff

Starring: Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn,
John Leguizamo, Andrew J. Ferchland.

Robert De NirO is doing an awful lot of work lately, some of it
good (Casino) some of it mediocre (Heat). In The Fan his
performance vacillates between the two.

Nobody does a "psycho" quite as well as De Niro. Has anyone
bettered his portrayal of a troubled Vietnam vet in Taxi Driver?

Has anyone personified violence better than he did in Scorses's
update of Cape Fear?

Here he plays Gil Renard, Mr Middle America, with a screw loose.
Gil has the worn outlook of a man who has too often confronted
failure. His hair looks like it has been styled using a knife and
fork, his clothes and brow are rumpled, his sales patter matey and
outdated.

During the film, De Niro sells: a lot of knives. He is an expert on
them. Big ones, small ones, hunting ones, combat ones, all of them
lovingly cared for and sexily captured on celluloid, thanks to
director Tony Scott's trademark glamorous style,

It's all very phallic, and once you've seen the camera linger on
Gil's highly polished wares, you know it's only a question of time
before he unsheathes one and gets stuck into cutting up a victim or
two.

And it's not long before you realize that target number one will
ultimately be Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) a swaggering,
loudmouthed baseball player, the latest addition to Gil's favourite
team the San Francisco Giants.

Bobby is everything Gil always wanted to be. He is talented,
effortlessly successful, a perfectionist who can attain perfection.
Gil sees himself as a bit of a perfectionist too, the only problem
being that he isn't really very good at anything, not even at
flogging knives.

He can't meet the sales figures laid down by his unforgiving boss,
he has a failed marriage and an ex-wife who despises him (nicely
played by Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn), a son (Andrew J Ferchland) he
can't relate to and as a result, an awful lot of pent-up anger.

A degree of this he dissipates at ballgames, as during a father/son
outing to a ballgame where his anger continually bubbles to the
surface as he lectures his unfortunate child on the game.

De Niro's performance is perturbing, amusing and at times touching.
To see a man who is so far removed from what he wants to be is
poignant, and this is the key to the film's success. To an extent
we can understand the frustrations that leads him to be obsessed
with the arrogant millionaire baseball player, the man who
personifies everything Gil feels he ought to be.

But as Gil's actions become increasingly violent, he becomes less
sympathetic and the film begins to resemble just another
psychothriller. This, combined with Tony Scott's overly slick
images sees the film descend into areas that are the familiar and
glossy realm of Hollywood. Ironically, the more The Fan turns into
a thriller, the less it thrills and as De Niro's character becomes
more psychotic he becomes correspondingly less complex and
therefore less interesting.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: THE WRITING SCENE: A Shopkeeper's Diary: A
writer's debut on an outlying island 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JANE RAM

When outlying island dwellers say where they live, most city
dwellers react in a predictable way. The typical first question is,
"How do you do your shopping? Do you have a supermarket?"

"We don't have a supermarket, but we do have Green Cottage!" Lamma
Islanders reply.

Within less than two years, the little shop on Yung Shue Wan's Main
Street has become an institution. Rustic wooden seats or the nearby
sea wall have made it a meeting place as well as the source of
everything from aroma therapy oils and wholemeal bread to steaming
espressos or glasses of fresh orange juice.

These days Green Cottage has diversified further, selling Birds in
the Sky, to give a direct translation of the title of  the $48 book
written by Queenie So Lai-chun.

Professional translator, former city dweller, dedicated greenie,
tireless farmer and full-time observer of human nature, So is the
owner and manager of Green Cottage. "I always wanted to write
something about Lamma," she says. "This funny community is unique
in Hong Kong."

Changed topic: She originally wanted to write about being a farmer
but once she became involved in selling green products, she found
herself spending so much time in the shop that it seemed only
natural to write about life on Main Street. The result is a
collection of short stories, which provide glimpses of Lamma life,
and the major concerns of the island's inhabitants.

Some of the stories are based on readily identifiable, real life
Yung Shue Wan characters - the Pizza Lady among them. Others have
been distilled through So's imagination and emerged in new forms.
Directly, or indirectly, everything in the book relates to Lamma,
she says, although less than a third is actually about keeping a
shop. Most stories touch on environmental issues. "I hope the book
will encourage people to value Lamma and keep it beautiful."

Three power station chimneys dominate Yung Shue Wan's scenery, but
instead of complaining, the long-suffering residents are inclined
to joke about them. So collected some of the comments - life's
exclamation marks, according to the philosopher; Salem cigarettes,
according to the chain smoker; blunt pencils according to the
professor; fingers with black nail polish, according to the
secretary; and so on.

Different viewpoints can transform the subject matter. So tells the
story of two Lamma residents, each with a big tree in his garden,
one to be doted over, the other to be torn down. Arguments between
their respective overseers ensue - to be put into So's record.

And then there was the 40-year-old who was proud to announce her
pregnancy - and her 50-year-old husband who arrived later to
complain his pension would be chewed up bringing up the baby.

So says hers is the first book in Chinese about Lamma, and it's
almost certainly the first book of any sort about Hong Kong's third
largest island. "Most people seem amazed at the idea that anyone on
Lamma can even read, let alone write," says So.

Birds in the Sky is boldly labelled "Islands Series No 1" and more
books are already in hand, including one being written by So's
partner, David Sheel, based on the diary of one of his forebears
who worked on the southern coast of China a century ago. So plans
more volumes of stories, although she says her next book will
probably be about the turtle who recently laid her eggs on a remote
Lamma beach: before anyone could really appreciate what a special
event this was, the eggs were dug up and eaten.

Main Street has certainly been an education, So says. "On the farm,
everybody I dealt with was so nice, it was like being cut off from
the real world, like being in an ivory tower. The problem was that
the ivory tower was getting smaller and smaller!

"The reality of Main Street was quite a shock. Suddenly I had to
deal with the real world of drunks and suppliers. After six months
I realized that it was impossible to carry the farming mentality
into the street. I learned to be more business oriented, more
practical and less idealistic to be able to survive. I'm not a shop
keeper by nature and I paid a heavy price for that lesson. I work
very hard, but I'm not very good at it. I've been writing all my
life and I continue to collect ideas and stories. I plan to do more
writing in the future: all I need is the time."

For the moment at least So does not plan an English version of her
book. "There are too many Cantonese puns for a successful
translation."

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: TRAVEL: Garlic Spells Trouble: There's no
substitute for metal at silver fest 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PHILIP REEVE, P.42-43

A solitary drum began to beat. The simple rhythm, booming over and
over, soon became hypnotic. And then the air was filled with the
ethereal sound of hundreds of tiny bells jingling. One by one, out
of the surrounding houses, young Miao women appeared - dressed to
the nines in silver: magnificent headdresses, necklaces and thick
neck chains, bracelets, earrings, and tunics fringed with bells.
They surrounded the older woman, tirelessly drumming out the beat,
and began to dance in a slow, shuffling circle around the drum.

This was one of the highlights of the annual Sisters' Meal festival
of the Miao people, held amidst the camel-hump hills and folded
terraces of Guizhou's Shidong district. An extravagant courtship
ritual, it allowed the eligible young women to show off their
beauty to the men and at the same time their families' wealth -
invested in the fabulous silver costumes they wore. Families begin
collecting silver jewellery and headdresses for their daughters as
soon as they are born. Over 60 types of intricate silverwork can
make up a full costume including tiaras, coronets, combs and
phoenix crowns.

Wearing the heavy costumes for hours is gruelling for a young woman
but the more silver she can wear, the greater the prestige for her
family. Many silver costumes weigh as much as 15 kilograms.

All the men formed an admiring audience around the dancers,
preparing to make advances, proposals, and, for some, the
beginnings of courtship. The women prepare multi-coloured "sisters'
rice" for the young suitors, with symbols hidden inside to signal
their true feelings. A pair of red chopsticks means she has
accepted a hand in marriage; a garlic or red chilli, that the man
should look elsewhere; pine needles, that the man present silks and
colourful threads for further consideration.

The Miao people are surely one of China's most colorful ethnic
minorities, certainly the most festive. The "Black Miao" alone
celebrate 448 different festivals during the year. The hundreds of
different types of Miao in southwest China have been placed in five
broadly-defined categories - Black, Blue, Red, White and Flowery
Miao - though these convenient classifications do little justice to
the enormous diversity that exists in their customs, festivals and
dress (over a hundred prominent types). They are spread over an
area roughly the size of Germany and France, inhabiting seven
different provinces, though half of the Miao population of seven
million are concentrated in Guizhou.

Nobody knows their exact origins and this has led to a good deal of
conjecture. Some Chinese scholars have pointed to Tibet, Mongolia
and even Lapland as the Miao's original homeland. It seems more
likely that they inhabited the valleys of the Huang He (Yellow
River) around 4,500 years ago; scholars have even suggested they
were the first farmers in the Yellow River valley, terracing the
land to grow rice. The waves of invading Mongols from the north led
to a gradual migration southwards and it is estimated that they
began settling in Guizhou from at least the Qin and Han periods
(221 BC - AD 220).

During the Song (960 - 1279) and Ming (1368 - 1644) Dynasties, the
Miao were pushed further south into even more remote and rugged
areas by the advancing Han Chinese troops and settlers, eventually
reaching Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - where they still live
today, known internationally as the Hmong. Allies of the Americans
in the Vietnam War, many of the Hmong were permitted to settle in
the US. Recently, Japanese scholars have been studying Miao customs
and language in detail as it has been suggested that the two
cultures may have common roots. The Miao of southeast Guizhou have
a much more imaginative explanation of their origins; the first
Miao man, according to legend, hatched from the eggs of a butterfly
(married to a bubble!); a water buffalo, a dragon, an elephant, a
snake, a tiger, a thunder god, and more abstract phenomena such as
calamities and ghosts, also figure in their richly storied
beginnings.

Exactly when the Miao started producing silver jewellery and
costumes is also not known but it is thought to have been during
the Ming period. Never having mined silver themselves, the Miao
purchased it from traders usually in the form of silver coins which
they then melted down.

At the time of the Cultural Revolution in the '60s, the Miao feared
their wealth would be confiscated by the Red Guards and so many
families buried their heirlooms in the hills. Luckily, that proved
only an interlude.

The central government, not unsympathetic to local traditions,
established annual silver quotas for the Miao way back in 1949.
Today, the "silver" tends to be a silver-plated base metal or one
of various silver alloys.

It is in the southeast of Guizhou, in districts like Shidong, that
the silverwork is the most outstanding and intricate. Many
villages, such as Tang Long near Shidong, have a number of skilled
silversmiths fashioning up to a hundred different types of silver
jewellery and adornments for their womenfolk. The Miao women, with
equal workmanship, produce exquisitely-embroidered textiles, often
full of colourful mythological figures and scenes.

In recent years Guizhou has opened up as an exciting destination
for the more adventurous tourist, and the Miao with their
extravagant silver costumes and lively festivals almost every day
of the year, are the province's prime attraction.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: A Prophet's Rise & Fall: New papers tell more of
China's Christ figure: God's Chinese Son: The Heavenly Kingdom of Hong
Xiuquan 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By Jonathan Spence

New York: HarperCollins

Extraordinary dangers may flow from a book as volatile as the
Bible, writes Jonathan Spence by way of an introduction to one of
the most amazing periods of Chinese history, the Taiping
Revolution. The prolific Yale history professor argues in his
latest book that more than anything else, it was one man's
interpretation of Christian scripture than turned China upside down
from 1851-64, bringing the Ching Empire to its knees. Spence echoes
many other sources when he writes that in the process, at least 20
million people were killed in battle or starved to death.

The author says he would never have contemplated adding to the
ample literature on the period were it not for the fact that about
10 years ago, new texts were discovered in the British Museum.
These volumes record purported visions of God and Jesus relayed to
Hong Xiuquan and some of his fellow believers. They also offer a
detailed description of life and events in China in the mid-18th
century.

Spence gained access to the books and went to Beijing to consult
with the man who had uncovered them, Wang Qingcheng. He decided
there was room for a book focused on Hong himself and the mechanics
of his enormous sway over thousands of followers.

Hong's introduction to Christianity came by a circuitous route.
Western missionaries were active in China in the 1830s,
distributing Bibles and related tracts. One Chinese convert, Liang
Fa, translated parts of the Bible and liked to give them away
outside the hall in Guangzhou where Confucian examinations were
held. Hong, at the time a schoolteacher from a small Hakka village,
happened to pick up one such handout on his way home after an
unsuccessful attempt to pass the exams in 1836.

Heady stuff: These random translations - particularly of Old
Testament prophets, the teachings of Jesus and the book of
Revelations - ultimately had a profound effect on Hong, who was
already sympathetic to the harsh lot of peasants like his father.
Following another failed attempt at the examinations, he grew ill
and fell into a delirious state on the 50km walk home. He later
described this experience as a journey to heaven where he was
reunited with his relatives, learned that he was the younger
brother of Jesus, underwent a heavenly baptism and was instructed
to banish evil from the earth.

By the time Hong failed the exams for the third time in 1843,
China's defeat in the Opium War had thoroughly discredited the
Manchu rulers and Confucius, too, in the minds of many.

Hong began his movement (called Tai Ping, or great peace) to drive
the forces of evil from the land and establish a New Jerusalem. A
handful of followers grew to thousands, despite incredible
hardships and setbacks and draconian codes of conduct, and the
Taiping took control of Nanjing as the seat of their Heavenly
Kingdom.

Spence takes pains to show that Western religious influence was
only part of the story. He asserts that "millenarian" thinking was
a phenomenon that evolved independently in different parts of the
world, including China. For example, until about 1500 BC, Egyptian,
Mesopotamian and Indo-Iranian cultures saw death as a final
darkness. Then through Zoroaster (Zarathustra) belief grew that
another worldly existence could come about following an apocalyptic
triumph of good over evil. This was the root of biblical
apocalypse.

In China, Spence points to accepted certainties first established
in the fifth century BC Lao Zi - paradox, balance and the absence
of dogmatism - later undergoing a similar erosion. Between the
third and sixth centuries AD, he writes, new Taoist and Chinese
Buddhist ideas combined to create an apocalyptic vision where a
celestial saviour and his chosen ones on earth would survive a
period of terrible destruction to form an ideal, peaceful society.

Even trying to narrow his focus to the inner workings of one man,
Spence must deal with a large cast of characters and many
complexities. He succeeds in bringing his material to life,
particularly through an inventive use of the present tense that
gives his narrative a journalistic feel.

Whether Hong emerges any more fathomable is open to debate.
Certainly the Western missionaries who met or corresponded with him
remained largely mystified by him, unable to reconcile his very
literal religious interpretations and uncompromising mission with
their own. Hong did not take kindly to their criticism.

But Spence does succeed in adding dimension to this historical
figure. Elsewhere, generally, he is portrayed simply as a Chinese
hero. Here, his fleshed-out story has the elements of tragedy; a
great man of noble purpose brought down by a fatal flaw. For Hong,
singleminded belief in his own infallibility bred dissension in the
ranks. That was his undoing.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: BOOKS: A Change of Season: Painful journey to
enlightenment: Bound Feet & Western Dress 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.40-41

By Pang-mei Natasha Chang

New York: Doubleday

I flipped through Bound Feet & Western Dress and put it down,
dismissing it as yet another yarn from some festering banana,
whingeing about being neither American nor Chinese. I remembered
enduring The Joy Luck Club, only to see a succession of characters
climb further down their navels, and concluded this cross-cultural
confessional stuff was spinning right out of control.

There was another problem with Bound Feet. It mixed the story of
one generation with the story of another, something a friend did
not very successfully accomplish in retracing the travels of his
great grandfather tramping through 19th century Europe. On the
surface, it was a simple "then and now" exercise, but it became a
game of matching wits, with my friend in charge of allocating
space. The device pitted one-off but sometimes eloquent
observations of a dead diarist against the musings, snoozings more
like, of a young writer who recast every phrase till it was too
clever by half.

As it happened, I inadvertently picked up Bound Feet thinking it
was something else, and headed for San Francisco airport. By the
time we touched down at Pearson in Toronto, I had finished the book
enthralled.

Rare for a debuting author, Natasha Chang neatly avoids both
problems, reining in her own story to the barest, thought-provoking
essentials, and using these to bridge different chapters of her
great aunt Chang Yu-i's fascinating life. Yu-i was the daughter of
a prominent Shanghainese doctor, a prolific dad who produced eight
children, including one son who would become president of the Bank
of China.

She was also, more to the point, the wife of one of modern China's
most celebrated poets, Hsu Chih-mo, who comes off as a creep in
this tragic story. But Yu-i herself was clearly a figure of
history, too, having been the first in her family to escape the
hideous practice of foot binding, after a few agonizing days' trial
- and being the first in China to be divorced. Unfortunately, that
precedent-setting split didn't seem to free her emotionally to get
on with other relationships. And unravelling the psychological
knots tying her up reveals the various cultural and social
conundrums that make Yu-i's such an interesting story.

Enlightened as her father was for the times, Yu-i was not given the
educational opportunities lavished on her brothers, and basically
tracked for an arranged marriage.

She didn't see her husband-to-be till the big day, and didn't think
she was winning much of a prize when she did finally lay eyes on
him. Hsu, going through the motions of honouring his parents'
wishes but really hungering for a modern, educated woman, dismissed
Yu-i as a bumpkin from day one.

If that wasn't a clue of more unpleasantness to come, we soon learn
that he rarely talked to her and stayed abroad as much as possible
before finally abandoning her. This he did a few years later, like
the guy who went off to buy a quart of milk never to return, after
she joined him to resume their partnership in England.

Son number one: Even the birth of a son, Hsu Chi-cai, and a second
- the tra-gic Peter, who was born in Germany and died at three -
failed to warm him to her. Indeed, he suggested she abort her
second pregnancy. But he seemed to dote over Chi-cai when he was in
China, which was rare. Chi-cai, in fact, spent his earliest years
with his paternal grandparents, as the story flips between China
and Europe, with tangents following Yu-i's brother to America.

After England, Yu-i went to France to live with her student brother
for a time before moving to Germany where, having nailed down the
essentials of German, she found work in a Berlin kindergarten. This
period in some ways seems both the happiest and saddest part of her
life. Berlin was where son Peter was born, forming the centrepiece
of her live-in friendship with Dora Berger. But that happy
interlude disintegrated with Peter's death, Dora never to be seen
again.

In Germany, Yu-i acceded to divorcing Hsu, desperate to marry his
latest flame and literary soulmate. She returned to China but
divorce didn't free her from familial bonds with the in-laws, just
as Hsu's desertion failed to spur her to act on mating signals she
got from a Chinese she met in Germany.

In the end, we have a woman caught between social and political sea
changes, prepared to explore the new, but not deeply enough to
leave the old, which includes a form of reconciliation with Hsu,
not long before he dies in a plane crash.

Hoping ties with her by-now Bank of China GM brother would pay big
dividents, the directors of the Shanghai Women's Savings Bank
appointed her a vice president. She proved astute in business, but
with civil war heating up, she moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and later
remarried. But with the death of her second husband in 1974, she
decided on New York, where she was to live out her days with her
son always close at hand.

There were probably many women like Yu-i trying to cross that gulf
separating imperial and republican China. The hope is they did
better than achieve what seems the worst of both worlds.

We are lucky for Natasha Chang writing Yu-i's story down, a process
that involved years of interviews and intricate interpretation and
editing.

A victim of racial taunts growing up in America, Chang found
herself on her own journey of self discovery.

But unlike most second-liners warming up rock fans for the main
act, Chang's story is compelling, too, laying out her own
conundrums. One suspects that at least some of them were confronted
and overcome in the process of working on Bound Feet.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: ANTIQUES: First, Remove the Butter: Tibetan
furniture starts making its way to Hong Kong 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By HILARY BINKS, P.38-39

It was a painstaking process, gently removing the thick layer of
grime built up over centuries of exposure to the smoke and grease
of yak butter lamps in a Tibetan monastery. But gradually the
beautiful colours and gold leaf of the painted chest beneath were
revealed. Miraculously, the decoration was largely intact.

"A layer of butter covers almost everything in Tibet," says Shaun
Kelly of Zee Stone Gallery, "and in this case it protects the
valuable painting. The very dry climate in Tibet also means that
furniture can be preserved for centuries without looking old. As
long as you clean the pieces carefully and patiently, so as not to
remove the gold, you can restore them to their original state."

Traditional Tibetan furniture is the least researched field of
Tibetan art. While art forms related to Buddhism, such as statues
and thangkas, Buddhist scroll paintings, have been popular for some
time, until recently few furniture pieces have been available
outside Tibet. Over the last four years, however, a handful of
dealers in the US have pioneered the import of Tibetan furniture,
and now at least three Hong Kong galleries - C.P. Ching, Plum
Blossoms and Zee Stone - offer good selections.

Late market bloomer: Neglect of this branch of Tibetan art was not
surprising when one considers the practical difficulties and
expense involved in getting pieces to Hong Kong. It is one thing to
import thangkas, which can be easily rolled up and carried by hand,
quite another to arrange safe shipment of furniture from the high
Tibetan plateau first to Katmandu in Nepal, and from there to Hong
Kong.

"It certainly demands an act of faith to get the pieces out," says
Stephen McGuinness of Plum Blossoms, who has just held his first
exhibition of Tibetan furniture at his galleries in Hong Kong and
Singapore. "But my interest is both personal - my wife is Tibetan -
and professional. I have a deep interest in Buddhist art and I
think people will appreciate the incredible Tibetan craftsmanship."
Both Plum Blossoms and Zee Stone are also making the most of their
newly expanded gallery space to show the furniture to best
advantage.

The three main types of Tibetan furniture are chests, cabinets and
tables. Because of their largely nomadic existence, most ordinary
Tibetans had little, if any, furniture. There were no chairs in
Tibet, as the people preferred to sit on a rug on the ground or on
a low platform. But small tables, some of them portable, were used
to serve food and drink, especially butter tea, and the household
shrine would have a stand or altar table on which offerings could
be placed. Chests were used to store precious things and wealthier
households might possess larger cabinets.

Monasteries, centres of Tibet's wealth and economic power, no doubt
needed more furniture in which to store the vast quantities of
precious silks, thangkas and Buddhist scriptures they accumulated
through trade and donations. Some cabinets housed images of
deities. A smaller type of cabinet, the torgam, was made to hold
torma, sacrificial sculptures made from butter and flour.  Pegam
cabinets, unique to Tibet, had scalloped panels on three sides to
support heavy wood-covered Tibetan texts. But by no means all
furniture was made for monasteries, says Kelly. "I have seen chests
stacked up in private houses, and everyone needed small tea tables.
Apart from cabinets with a Tantric or obviously religious theme, I
don't think there is very much distinction between domestic and
monastic use."

In contrast to Chinese furniture, where the main focus was on the
quality of beautiful hardwoods such as huang hua-li , in Tibetan
furniture the wood was of little consequence. On one of the highest
plateaux in the world, mostly above 4,500 metres, the only timber
available were softwoods such as pine and cedar. Joinery techniques
were basic but still clever locking systems and hinges, always with
an emphasis on practicality and efficiency. Fittings were of brass
or iron.

The really important thing about the furniture was its painted
decoration. Sometimes the wood was covered with a soft cotton
material to prevent cracking before sizing, water-based mineral
colours and gold paint were applied. Many pieces also had gesso (a
white ground, like plaster) applied to give a raised delineation or
texture. Finally, pieces were coated with a shellac-type of
varnish.

Annie Marcz-Ching, of C.P. Ching, recalls the first time she saw
Tibetan furniture in Katmandu: "I was excited by the vividness of
the painting. When I buy, my first criterion is that a piece must
have life. That is, it has to be a painting, rather than just
painted.  When the painting is good, it feels completely different
from when somebody has just decorated the piece with another motif.
I was also fascinated by the different influences I could
distinguish. I could immediately see Chinese characteristics,
sometimes Indian ones also, and even Islamic elements in the
beautiful floral patterns - and yet the furniture is unmistakably
Tibetan. That is the charm of it."

Clues to dating: While no definitive guidelines have yet been
established for dating pieces, foreign influences can provide
valuable clues. From the 15th century, Chinese influence became
paramount in Tibet and many of the designs used on furniture,
including floral and dragon motifs, can be compared to those seen
on Chinese textiles and porcelain.

On this basis, Kelly believes that many Tibetan chests date from
the 17th century or even earlier, pre-dating more elaborate
cabinets which were more numerous during the heyday of the
monasteries in the 18th century.

But many features are uniquely Tibetan. Marcz-Ching points to the
painted flower cabinets, which she says are in particular demand at
the moment. "You can really see the character of the Tibetan people
here, very warm and cheerful. They love to use bright colours -
red, green, gold and blue. I think it has to do with the mountain
climate - when they see the flowers in spring they are very happy
and this is communicated in their art."

Chests used to store precious goods often bore auspicious
decoration associated with wealth, such as dragons bearing a tray
of jewels. Typically the central cartouche was encircled by a
geometric design with corner scrollwork. The sides of chests were
frequently painted with a tiger pelt design, believed by Tibetans
to possess protective powers. Buddhist emblems, such as the lotus,
the vase, and the endless knot, were also popular.

Tibetan Buddhism, incorporating the Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle"
school, Tantric practices from India, and elements of the
indigenous animist "Bon" religion, also had its own darker imagery.
"In this case," says Marcz-Ching, "what is wonderful is not what
meets the eye, but the symbolism.

"For the moment, people are only just becoming familiar with
Tibetan furniture, but in the long term, when they understand it
more, I think Tantric Buddhist pieces will represent part of a more
serious collection."

COVER STORY: A SEA OF TROUBLES 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.32-37

The territory's First International Symposium on Marine
Conservation gets under way in Hong Kong this weekend. Speakers
will address such concerns as destructive fishing practices,
pollution, increasing threats to biodiversity and low levels of
enforcement of current legislation to protect the oceans. Window,
which has regularly covered these issues since it was founded four
years ago, is a co-sponsor of the symposium. Neil Colclough reports
that the organizer - the Hong Kong Marine Conservation Society -
hopes to make people more aware of their stake in the marine
environment and the role they can play in protecting it.

UNSEEN and unsuspected by many Hong Kong people, there are deserts
scattered around the territory - beneath the sea. Years of
overfishing, including dynamite fishing, as well as pollution,
dredging and a general lack of environmental management have left
areas of the seabed a virtual wasteland.

"Divers in Hong Kong know there are hardly any fish to be seen," is
the grim picture painted by one local diver. This is particularly
chilling when the southern China region, including Hong Kong, is at
the edge of the world centre of marine biodiversity - the Indo-West
Pacific. Conservationists fear this diversity faces collapse unless
urgent action is taken. Species such as sea turtles, lobster,
several species of grouper and sea cucumber are already as good as
extinct around Hong Kong.

Trawlers working in pairs can regularly be seen ploughing the same
area within hours of one another, in some cases depleting fish
stocks below a recoverable level. Perhaps even more destructive is
dynamite fishing. Divers from conservation groups describe areas
such as those around Rocky Harbour, where the coral lies in heaps
of rubble, with only crusty species of algae surviving. Dredging
and dumping have turned other areas into swirling mud pits.

Until recently, there were few laws protecting Hong Kong's marine
life. Even though the government has now legislated fines for
dumping, critics point out that it is hardly enforced, with little
policing and usually low fines imposed on transgressors.

There are some encouraging signs: marine conservationists have
started to win a few battles. In 1992, a sand-dredging project in
Mirs Bay was halted in the face of an environmental impact
assessment of the potential damage to coral reefs, backed up by
extensive lobbying from green groups. It was the first time such a
scheme had been stopped because of possible biodiversity loss.

Sanctuaries: In addition, the Marine Parks Ordinance was passed
last year, creating four protected marine sanctuaries.

But such measures are not enough, according to marine
conservationists, who say more public support needs to be created
to force the government to make more improvements. They believe the
government's primary environmental focus should be to formulate and
adopt a comprehensive, coordinated plan to save the territory's
marine life.

As part of the drive to put the public spotlight on the state of
Hong Kong's marine environment, the territory is hosting its First
International Symposium on Marine Conservation at the University of
Hong Kong this weekend. Organized by the Hong Kong Marine
Conservation Society, the two-day event has attracted local experts
and those from the US, the Philippines and Vietnam.

The symposium brings together scientists, politicians, lawyers and
media representatives in an attempt not only to highlight the
problems, but also to offer some solutions.

Society chairman Dr Brian Darvell says there has been a tendency
over the past few years to restrict the environmental debate to a
dialogue between green groups and government agencies, excluding
the general public.

"People in general need to be involved in these discussions because
it is their quality of life which is being affected," he says. "Yet
all the lobbying tends to be done in the opposite direction,
towards the administration, and argued on technical grounds. Our
intention is to make people aware of what's going on, enthuse them
to take action and then empower them to take that action."

Given the state of Hong Kong's marine environment, much action is
needed, according to conservationists. While terrestrial
conservation began in earnest in the mid-1970s with the
establishment of Hong Kong's country parks, the marine environment
has been largely ignored until recently.

A government commission was set up in 1965 to study conservation
needs. It formulated a plan for both terrestrial and marine
conservation but only the former was acted upon, initially with the
passage in 1976 of the Country Parks Ordinance.

This lack of action, combined with the effects of pollution,
overfishing and dredging, has proved devastating, according to Dr
Gregor Hodgson of the Institute for Environmental Studies at the
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Essential: "Biodiversity loss is occurring at an unprecedented rate
in Hong Kong and southern China," he says in a paper to be
presented at the symposium. "It is essential to move forward to
implement a conservation process now, or there will not be much
left to preserve."

A major cause of this loss is overfishing, say conservationists.
They argue that intensive fishing over the past few decades,
fuelled by technical improvements to trawlers and equipment, has
left very few edible or larger species of fish in local waters.

Hong Kong fishermen now focus almost exclusively on "trash fishing"
- smaller species, such as sardines, pony fish and anchovies, which
are sold as feed to fish farms at high prices: $2.5 per kg. These
species are now also being fished too intensely, according to
conservationists, who say the devastation is spiralling down the
ecological chain. Not only are stocks of the smaller fish being
severely depleted, but the techniques employed in trash fishing
also catch the fry of bigger species.

Bottom trawling with small mesh nets catches high levels of fry of
such fish as bream, croaker and goatfish, which are commercially as
well as ecologically important.

"The fishing fleet in Hong Kong is far too big. Pair trawlers are
going through the same areas several times within hours of each
other," says Darvell. "How can we justify that intensive fishing
effort when the returns are negligible? This activity is denuding
everything in the areas where it takes place. It's just getting out
of hand."

Darvell and others argue that the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department has known for years about the decline of large fish in
local waters but has refused to admit there is a problem or attempt
to tackle it by limiting fishing activity.

However, in a report to be presented at the symposium, department
officer Keith Wilson concedes not only that current levels of trash
fishing are "alarming," but that few bigger fish are being caught
inshore. Conservationists believe Wilson's report is the first
public confirmation by a department offical of what they have been
saying for years.

Inshore: "The impacts of the Hong Kong fry fishing industry on
fisheries resources may also be unsustainable," Wilson's paper
says. "The low proportion of demersal fish [those that live near
the bottom] in the inshore catch taken by vessels less than 15
metres is indicative of very high fishing pressures."

The demand for trash fish took off when the number of fish farms in
Hong Kong expanded enormously throughout the 1970s. Today more than
1,500 licensed farms in 26 fish culture zones produce just under a
quarter of all the live fish consumed in Hong Kong.

The knock-on effect is that of the fish caught in Hong Kong waters,
roughly 80 per cent are trash fish sold to farms. Less than 10 per
cent are higher value demersal species, according to Wilson's
report.

In addition to overfishing, other capture practices are damaging to
the marine environment. Dynamite fishing also kills non-target fish
such as the fry of larger species, particularly as it is usually
conducted where fish congregate, such as spawning and feeding
grounds. Police fear dynamite fishing is on the increase: so far
this year they have uncovered 368kg of explosive used for this
purpose, compared with 15kg for the whole of 1993.

Also destructive is the use of vacuum suction and dredging devices
to harvest clams, a practice increasingly common, according to the
AFD.

The suction method pulls up everything in the target area, while
dredging - dragging heavy steel frames covered with steel meshes
along the seabed - ploughs deep into the mud, seriously disturbing
the environment. Such dredging has angered fishermen in Wong Chuk
Kok Hoi where most clams are harvested. But unlike dynamite
fishing, the practice is legal.

If overfishing is indicative of a lack of initiative taken by the
government in protecting the marine environment, some
conservationists also claim that even where laws have been enacted,
this has largely proven a hollow effort.

Earlier this year, areas at the bays of Yan Chau Tong and Lai Chi
Wo in the eastern New Territories and Hoi Ha Wan just off Sai Kung
Country Park were designated as marine reserves. Hong Kong has more
than 50 species of coral - as many as in the whole of the
Caribbean. Sixty per cent of them occur at Hoi Ha Wan alone.

As marine parks, the areas are theoretically protected from dumping
or other damaging activities. However, there is a grace period
allowed for fishing, which has angered many conservationists who
say fishing should be stopped now.

Patrol: There is also concern that there will not be sufficient
resources to ensure the integrity of the parks - police have
privately admitted they may be unable to patrol the areas
regularly. "Its no use introducing laws unless you're prepared to
back them up," says Darvell.

The government's environmental protection programme in general has
been marked by a lack of willingness to enforce legislation or take
the initiative in practical terms, according to Brian Baillie,
lecturer in professional legal education at the University of Hong
Kong.

In his paper to the symposium, he says Hong Kong has adopted "a
rhetorical approach" to enforcement of environmental laws.

Baillie argues that environmental objectives and policies, in terms
of the written law, are at least adequate. Similarly there are
clear enforcement powers and suitable penalties at the disposal of
the courts. "But the government has paid lip service only to its
own standards and powers," he says. "Its rhetoric about
environmental care is just that: rhetoric."

Under the various local laws the Environmental Protection
Department has the power to:

 License polluting, discharging or dumping.

 Monitor emissions and discharges.

 Investigate sources of pollution, including entering private
property.

 Prosecute offenders.

 In some circumstances, where the area comes under the Water
Pollution Control Ordinance, it can order an offender to clean up
or pay the cost of cleaning up.

But despite an increase in the number of prosecutions over the last
four years - there were 249 under the Water Pollution Control
Ordinance last year - Baillie believes there is an overall lack of
resolution on the government's part to enforce environmental laws.

Even before the EPD was given the power to prosecute polluters,
Baillie argues that the attorney general could have done so using
the common law remedy of public nuisance. "The fact that the AG
never bothered to do so, despite overwhelming evidence of illegal
discharges continuing for years, as with the Tuen Mun River, is
simply another indication of the government's tradition of
placating the business community to the detriment of the
environment," according to Baillie.

Even now, he claims, the EPD's own manual says that prosecuting an
offender should be the last option.

When offenders are prosecuted, Baillie says, with few exceptions
the fines handed out by magistrates are pitifully low and have
little deterrent effect. He says the average fine for environmental
offences from May 1995 to May this year was about $13,000. This
covers first and second offences - fines for repeat offences are
supposedly heavier.

For one of the most common offences of illegal discharge of waste
into public drains, the first fine is $400,000. For subsequent
offenders the maximum fine is $1 million, with provisions for
culprits to be imprisoned and fined $40,000 per day for a
continuing offence.

Baillie says heavy fines are occasionally imposed by more
environmentally enlightened members of the Judiciary, but the
generally low fines are probably the result of the lack of
precedent for environmental convictions.

When the EPD first launched prosecutions, the fines were low and
few if any cases went to higher courts, which traditionally provide
penalty guidelines to the lower courts, where such cases are
generally handled.

"So it is very difficult for magistrates, who hear all first-
instance environmental prosecutions, to work out where on the range
of possible penalties they should pitch each offender," says
Baillie.

Slows: Other critics of the government's environmental record claim
that bureaucracy often slows down the pace of implementing
effective measures.

So what is the way forward in the drive to protect Hong Kong's
marine environment?

According to Hodgson, there needs to be a move away from ad hoc
policies and action towards a comprehensive strategy to preserve
and manage Hong Kong's marine life. He says an "integrated
biodiversity management plan" would be based on zoning and tough
regulations to protect marine life. Following its implementation,
there would also need to be continuous and comprehensive monitoring
of biodiversity changes over time.

Hodgson says in his paper that conservation needs to be viewed
holistically - "from mountain top to seabed." He adds: "For
example, common sense tells us that marine parks should not be
planned in areas adjacent to heavy industrial zones, where the
threat of pollution will be high." He also says that conservation
needs to have realistic aims, with the assumption that many
problems will not be solved in the near future.

Survey: As a first and urgent step, Hodgson believes a fast
reconnoitre rather than a prolonged in-depth study needs to be made
to establish the state of the marine environment - what is left,
what has gone and what can and cannot be saved. This is necessary
despite the fact that such a swift survey might result in mistakes.

"Given the rapid rate of biodiversity loss now occurring, unless
immediate decisions are taken on what should be saved, then it will
be too late," he says. "The alternative, to wait until every
species and its ecological role is known prior to taking action,
would be catastrophic."

Hodgson argues that ultimately conservation, if it is to be
successful, cannot be restricted by political borders, and Hong
Kong will have to combine its efforts with southern China.

Closer to home, Baillie believes that changing the law to allow
private citizens to take legal action against polluters and the
government for failing to prevent illegal pollution would be a
major step forward in ensuring environmental laws are enforced. He
says such provisions in the US have proved effective.

"Indeed, the major victories for the environment in America since
they first embarked on their environmental legislation in 1969 have
very often been due not to the EPA's [the quasi-government
Environmental Protection Agency] vigilance or initiative, but
rather to the efforts, via litigation, of concerned citizens'
groups," he argues.

For this to happen in Hong Kong he believes three "foundation
pillars" are necessary. These are:

 Rights for citizens to sue both offenders and non-performing
government agencies.

 No awards of legal costs against unsuccessful plaintiffs in
actions brought against government agencies.

 Genuine, comprehensive, inexpensive freedom of information
legislation and procedures.

Baillie argues that a clean and protected environment should be
viewed in the context of basic human rights.

Linking all the recommendations and proposals to clean up Hong
Kong's marine environment, most conservationists and their
supporters agree that their success largely depends on getting the
general public involved. Not only does public awareness need to be
increased, but people generally need to be involved in the planning
process.

COMMENTARY: The ideal ruler rarely speaks. When a good thing is done, the
people will say 'We did it': Catching up with Lao Zi 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By GERALD CHEN, P.31

FOR THE moment let's forget about floods and the disgraceful
pollution man has brought to our planet's rivers, lakes and even
seas. Let us also pause to consider water - that life-giving
element as perceived by ancient Chinese thinkers more than 2,500
years ago. To Lao Zi (who lived around 571 BC), founder of Taoism,
water symbolized the very essence of Tao, the Great Way.

"Supreme goodness - Tao or Taoist - is like water," says the
Daodejing (one of China's great contributions to understanding of
the universe and humanity), which literally translates as Virtues
of the Tao, or figuratively as The Great Way. "Water benefits all
creation but never contends. It stays in places that most men
avoid. The Taoist prefers to be in the company of the lowly. He
does not err because he never contends."

In another reference to water, the Daodejing says: "Nothing is more
soft and pliant than water, yet it is capable of subduing the
strong and breaking the powerful. The weak can conquer the strong
as softness can conquer hardness. Although everyone knows this
truth, no one ever practises it because truth often appears to be
untrue."

As symbolism in the philosophical thinking of Lao Zi, it would
naturally be wrong to judge his concept of water as we understand
it today. But its value lies in the insight it gives into the way
our world moves and fulfils itself and, indeed, how human beings
should behave towards nature as well as towards fellow humans.

In this space it is unnecessary to go into what seem to be the
absurd extremes of Lao Zi's outlook, such as his vision of an ideal
small state which has absolutely no contact with its neighbours, or
his rejection of knowledge and learning on the grounds that they
are twin sources of evil.

What many pundits have found intriguing are the numerous glittering
sparks of Lao Zi's philosophic thought which still ring true today
- despite the fact that they seem contrary to conventional wisdom.

Philosophical opposites: A contemporary of Confucius, Lao Zi was
founder of one of the two most important schools of thought to
dominate Chinese culture down through the ages. Although a
personalized god is absent in both Taoism and Confucianism, their
ideas on what constitutes good government, virtue and the meaning
of life are distinctly different. In fact, they are opposite.

In the final analysis, it might be said that in the dialectics of
both schools, Confucianism, with its stress on studying the
classics and aspiration to official duties, takes a positive
attitude towards life whereas the Taoist position, with its stress
on inaction and affinity with nature, the meek and lowly, is
totally negative.

The alternating dominant positions of Confucianism and Taoism in
Chinese history have not obliterated the fact that both continue to
exert profound influences on Chinese culture. It is well said that
Chinese intellectuals prefer to observe the loyalties and ethical
values of Master Kong's teachings when serving as officials. Poets
and writers, on the other hand, draw inspiration from the subtle
feelings and romanticism of the Taoist gospel. But this does not
rule out the possibility of Taoist officials showing great respect
for Confucian ethics in their public life, while continuing to
relish their Taoist thoughts in private. Nor can it be overlooked
that disgraced or disheartened Confucian officials often turn to
Taoism to find solace in a quiet life away from worldly worries. In
effect, it really is quite possible for a Chinese to be now a
Confucianist and now a Taoist.

That the legacies of Confucian and Taoist thinking are part and
parcel of contemporary Chinese culture is evident from the fact
that traces of their influence can be found among Chinese
businessmen, Buddhists, Christians, artists, scientists and
communists.

Grades of rulers: The subtleties of Lao Zi's thinking are still
frequently manifest in his maxim that truth often appears untrue.
"The best ruler of a state," he said, "is he whose subjects are not
aware that he is there. The next to the best is adored, the next is
feared while the worst is despised by his subjects. The ideal ruler
rarely speaks. When a good thing is done, the people will say: 'We
did it'."

It might be argued in the present day that both the first and last
forms of such governments are democratic. Although "invisible," the
first case is effective, which is what matters. The last, worst,
case - while an adversarial form of government - is also a
democracy. But the first is an example of the effectiveness of
"doing nothing" (inaction), the most important tenet of Taoist
outlook.

The ways of nature are to take from excesses to replenish the
deficient. Man behaves the opposite way by taking from the
deficient to enlarge the excesses. The Taoist seeks to balance the
inequality by adopting the ways of nature. Although "doing nothing"
can result in "accomplishing everything," the Taoist has no wish or
reason to feel proud or jubilant. Simply, he has done nothing.

The wise appear foolish, great straightness bends, great cleverness
appears clumsy, great eloquence is short on words, loudness is
silence, speech is poor before ideas, and misfortune is the seed of
blessing (and vice versa).

Said Lao Zi: "When common folks hear what I say, they just laugh.
Why shouldn't they? Greatness comes belatedly. Great sounds sound
faint. Tao cannot be named. Had they not laughed, I would not be
talking about Tao."

CHINA: SPORTS: Warming Up to Sports: Fujian people's route to health 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZENG XIANCHENG in Fuzhou, P.28-29

EARLY morning sunlight finds numerous people in Chinese cities
jogging, playing ball or dancing in public parks or by the
roadside. At this time of day, all these people - of different
ages, various occupations and diverse interests - seem to be
focused on a single goal: achieving a long and healthy life.

Freed from the old worries about lack of food and clothing, more
and more Chinese, as those in Fujian province shown in these
pictures, are becoming health conscious and spending increasing
amounts of money and time on sport.

As with almost anything in China, the history of sport can be
traced back aeons through a colourful range of traditional
activities and styles. The Fujian area used to be called Min. The
Min people were an ancient ethnic group who were integrated with
the Han - the majority of the Chinese race - centuries ago. As a
result, many traditional sports, such as Chinese martial arts and
dragon boat racing, were adopted by the Min as well.

Today, many Western sports - golf, snooker, aerobics to name just a
few - are becoming increasingly popular with the younger people in
Fujian. Well-equipped gyms are being opened in many cities in the
province, attracting large numbers of eager exercisers.

The fitness trend is also fuelling a spending boom and sales of
sporting goods, including home exercise machines, are rising
rapidly.

Fujian's provincial government has spent handsomely on building
sports facilities and supporting sporting events. More than 400
stadia and gyms have been built across the province in the last few
years. The cities of Quanzhou and Xiamen have each constructed
large, well-equipped sports centres, ending their chronic shortage
of such facilities.

Local governments in Fujian are keen on waging campaigns to
encourage people to participate in both traditional and modern
games. Sports meets are held frequently across the province and
last summer a number of "thousand-people" games were held in Fuqing
city. In each of these events a thousand participants competed in
swimming, jogging and martial arts exercises.

CHINA: BOOKS: Unmitigated Butchery: Vivid re-telling of Nanjing's 1937
nightmare, when 300,000 died at Japanese hands 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.27

Nanjing Massacre, 1937

Xu Zhigeng

Published by Chinese Literature Press

ON December 13, 1937, units of the invading Japanese Imperial Army
occupied Nanjing, at that time the capital of China. They entered
not as a disciplined force engaged in modern warfare abiding by the
Geneva Convention and other accepted moral and legal codes that
govern conflicts, but rather as ravening foxes into a hencoop. The
soldiers, encouraged and abetted by their leaders, began a campaign
of slaughter, torture and pillage that lasted for months on end.

Informed conservative estimates of the number of dead conducted at
the time, and immediately upon the expulsion of the Japanese, put
the death toll among a subdued and captive population at more than
300,000, the majority occurring during officially sanctioned
instances of mass slaughter and gratuitous violence.

Appalling as this was, does this one instance in an expansionist
period during which the Japanese slaughtered and pillaged across
Asia, merit a book to itself? Or is this merely an example of a
citizen of one country caring more about what happened to
compatriots than to the inhabitants of Vietnam, Burma, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Indonesia, to name but a few? Many other accounts
exist which document the planning and cruelty that went into
Japan's thwarted aggression, including the preparation of spy
rings, drug dealing, subornment and cruelty in the extreme.

The author justifies his publication on the grounds that, once the
idea had been suggested, he found it remarkably hard to uncover the
facts. Despite anecdotal evidence from survivors, historians seemed
to have largely passed over the event. Indeed, as a second edition
was being prepared for translation and press, Japan's justice
minister went on record to claim that the Nanjing Massacre "was a
complete fabrication" - a staggering denial that in itself makes
the need for a record such as this the more necessary.

It would seem that, at a time when ignorant youngsters in Fujian
province are buying Japanese military replicas, when Japanese
right-wing militarists are gaining press attention, and when
textbooks are claiming that Japan "entered China" rather than
invaded, there is an insistent need to put the facts on record,
lest we forget.

Neither designed as, nor perhaps desirable as, a work of literary
accomplishment, this account tackles the topic in analytic and
dispassionate fashion, despite the fact that even the Japanese
translators "found [their] eyes filling with tears" and were often
"ridden with a sense of crime."

Ordeal: Opening with an account of the (inadequate) defence of
Nanjing against military superiority, set in a time of divided
loyalties and poor communications, the author shows the peculiar
blend of heroism and scarce resources that characterized the
Chinese resistance to the Japanese occupation. From this he moves
on with chapters detailing aspects of the ordeal, not in a temporal
chronicle but as an examination of each outrage in turn.

Despite the inevitable repetition this entails, the themes are
strongly buttressed by eyewitness accounts from different
perspectives, leading the reader from house to street to riverside
in a never-ending orgy of carnage, waste and inhumanity.

We learn of thousands machine-gunned, hundreds doused in petrol and
set afire, groups buried alive, and rape and disembowelment as
daily occurrences.

The citizens of neutral powers and the Red Cross tried to enforce
safety zones for non-combatants, but to only limited avail. The
streets and rivers ran red while property was looted, destroyed or
shipped to Japan.

Perhaps the most spectacular instances of unnecessary cruelty
involved the beheading of innocent civilians in competitions
between Japanese officers testing the edges of their swords for
fun, accounts of which were published in Japanese papers for the
amusement of those unable to take part in this savage apology for
sport.

But was this any different from other wartime atrocities? The point
that the author wishes to leave us with is emphatically "yes."
While waste and plunder have historically accompanied armies,
modern sensibilities have given rise to accords and regard for the
well-being of civilians under occupied rule: these were disregarded
pointlessly and comprehensively. It can be no defence to the charge
that the occupiers behaved atrociously by saying, as did Japanese
commander Iwane Matsui: "The struggle between Japan and China
should be regarded as the unavoidable conflict between two
developing nations, and the rivalry between the national ideologies
of the two cultures."

Modern proponents of terrorism as warfare might seek to justify the
Japanese behaviour, saying that by terrorizing the occupied areas
they were following militarily sound principles of seeking to
demoralize the opponent. But, as one reads further into this
account of the massacre, such pleas appear hollow and specious: why
adopt a policy of stupidity and waste?

At a time when nationalisms and ideologies again threaten to clash
in Southeast Asia over territory, we would do well to read this
account and, even if we cannot agree on what the ethical
considerations are, to call to mind Sun Tzu's observation, made in
The Art of War, probably compiled during the Warring States period
(475-221 BC): "Generally in war the best policy is to take a state
intact; to ruin it is inferior to this."

CHINA: HEALTH: Vast Majority Ignore Need to Clean Teeth: Toothbrushes used
by only half population 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JAMES NING, P.26

IN THE West at least, it has long been as essential a personal-
hygiene instrument as a nailbrush. Infants as well as adults use it
at the start and finish of each day, and wouldn't dream of
travelling any distance without it. It's as prominent in TV
advertisements and print ads as on the shelves of pharmacies. There
was even a song written about it - quite a tribute for a stick of
plastic with a few dozen bristles stuck on one end.

Take a bow, toothbrush.

But while its use is widespread in developed countries, it is still
far from ubiquitous in China. Only about half the population of 1.2
billion use one, even though it was first imported from the West
early this century.

Old concept: Not that the concept of cleaning one's teeth was
earth-shatteringly new to the country. The well-to-do were
polishing their molars, sans toothbrush, with lumps of rock salt as
early as the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), though the practice was
never widely popularized.

Currently, say national public health officials, about 60 per cent
of China's 700 million rural dwellers have yet to adopt the use of
a toothbrush, while 10-20 per cent of urbanites also ignore it.
Then there are, at a rough count, some 400 million infants and
senior citizens who have no need of one because they have no teeth.
The end result: only about 300 million mainland citizens brush
their teeth regularly.

The fact that only one-quarter of the population actually do so has
for years been of major concern to dental and medical authorities.
But shortage of funds has hampered large-scale publicity drives on
dental hygiene where it is most needed - in underdeveloped country
areas, most of whose people have never seen a toothbrush, let alone
used one. Many rural folk who now clean their teeth picked up the
habit after seeing town-dwellers doing so.

Poverty is another factor that prevents people from adopting such
healthy habits, lack of money rather than ignorance depriving them
of these fundamentals. Equally, strapped-for-cash local health
authorities are unable to hand out free toothbrushes and
toothpaste, or to mount promotional campaigns. Meanwhile, the
majority of people continue to spend surplus money on household
goods rather than dental hygiene. Their teeth receive attention
only when giving them problems.

China produces some 800 million toothbrushes a year, the majority
of low quality and thus cheap. Those who retail them invariably
have large inventories because customers tend to use their
toothbrush for some years before replacing it. A snap survey by the
municipal product-quality monitoring office at major department
stores in the Haidian district of Beijing last year showed that
more than 30 per cent of non-brandname brushes had serious defects
and should not have been allowed onto the market.

Potential risk: Many users of these brushes are unaware of the
potential risk to their health - an ulcerated mouth or infected
gums, for example. But, say health officials, even much-hyped
imported and domestic-brand brushes are not necessarily of a
quality that justifies their price tags. And medical experts in
Beijing continue to warn that new designs, promoted on TV as being
"recommended by most dentists overseas" are not necessarily
suitable for Chinese, or other races for that matter.

Last month, reporting China's seventh annual Tooth Protection Day,
the Economic Daily carried a special report on dental matters. It
observed that moneyed people tend to opt for expensive imports in
the belief that dearer is better, while those on tight budgets are
often of necessity forced to disregard quality. The best
domestically produced toothbrushes, said the report, are just as
good as their foreign counterparts but sell for half the price.
Other points:

p Of toothbrushes replaced daily in hotel guest rooms, including
some top hotels, more than 90 per cent fall short of state quality
standards in one aspect or another, if not completely. This is
because managements keep such costs to a minimum.

p The report's writer could not specify the number of China's
toothbrush producers, but did learn that more than 30 are members
of the Association for Daily Necessities Industry. (Members of such
trade groups are usually major state-owned enterprises trying to
stay in business against the competition of far wealthier joint
ventures.) Combined, the domestic manufacturers would be a
formidable force; currently, most struggle by on their own.
However, several toothbrush firms in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei province, recently formed an industry group to form a
united front.

p Most manufacturers have been making the same models since their
firms were founded years, even decades, ago. Lack of funding and
technical know-how has prevented them from launching better models
using modern materials. Those who have contrived to come up with
fresh designs in recent years have found themselves with little
capital left over to promote their new products. Many of these
match the design and product quality of those from overseas.

p China's toothpaste producers are generally far more successful
with sales than brush makers. Thus, suggests the report, the two
should merge their operations in the same way as their powerful
foreign rivals to become more competitive. But this is not possible
at present because the two sectors belong to different industrial
areas. Toothpaste manufacturing is part of the chemical industry,
toothbrushes the Ministry of Light Industry. Central government,
assumes the report, would not be against a merger.

CHINA: Move West Proves Yugur Salvation 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE Yugur originated from an ancient nomadic tribe, the Ouigurs,
which roamed the Erhun river valley in northwest China during the
Tang dynasty (618-907). Dogged by foul weather and constant attacks
from the neighbouring Turkic Kirgiz people, the Ouigurs began
moving westward in separate groups in the mid-9th century. One of
the groups emigrated to today's Gansu province, and settled in
Guazhou (today's Dunhuang), Ganzhou (Zhangye) and Liangzhou
(Wuwei). Because the three places were all in the Hexi Corridor,
the former nomads became known as the Hexi Ouigurs.

From the mid-11th to 16th centuries, many of those in Guazhou
assimilated with local people, thus forming the community now known
as the Yugurs. During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the rulers
moved a large number of Yugurs further east to today's Zhangye
area. Through such gradual contact with the neighbouring Han
community, the Yugurs started to learn farming and animal
husbandry.

Today, about 90 per cent of the 12,000 Yugurs live in Sunan Yugur
Autonomous County, founded in Zhangye in 1954. A small number of
them can be found in Huangnibao township, in the Jiuquan area that
borders Zhangye. Blessed with abundant grassland, most Yugurs
continue to work in farming and animal husbandry. Others are
engaged in industry, mainly carpet-making, the fur trade and food
processing.

CHINA: FOCUS: Minority Yugurs Profit From Old Cultural Ways: Zhangye resort
contrasts industrial base 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZHONG ZHENGXIANG and CHEN JIAN in Zhangye, P.24-25

BUSINESS people know Zhangye in China's northeast Gansu province as
a burgeoning industrial town. Tourists, however, are drawn to its
Lan Hua Ping resort with its picturesque scenery and friendly
Yugurs, a culture numbering some 12,000.

A recent tour of the resort, 3,000 metres above sea level, which
attracts about 200,000 visitors a year, proves a rewarding
experience.

Our approach to the entrance was to the sound of folk songs by a
group of young Yugurs in ethnic dress. Their first greeting was a
hada (a piece of white silk used as welcoming gift) and a full cup
of qingke wine fermented from highland barley. According to local
custom, we took a sip, dipped the third finger of our right hand
into the wine, then flicked it three times to symbolize respect for
heaven, earth and the person serving the wine - in this instance a
Yugur woman. It seems that many tourists, failing to appreciate the
drink's potency, gulp the whole cup and become drunk.

Happily we remain sober, and are invited to eight tents bordering a
meadow slope, there to be served a Yugur meal. The tents are simply
furnished with a carpet and low tables and stools. Once we are
seated, young women wearing fancy head adornments matching their
colourful dresses serve the steaming hot buttered tea and roast
mutton, true highlights of Yugur cuisine.

Because the tea is mixed with parched flour and milk as well as
butter, it tastes rich though surprisingly not greasy. The unboned
roast mutton comes in large portions and, as we are reminded, is
best eaten by hand - a greasier experience than the tea and
remindful of the bacchanalian heroes of the Chinese classic Water
Margins. But pulling the meat apart requires more skill than we had
realized.

The most delicious part of sheep - the tail and tendons - are by
Yugur custom usually given to guests, while the shank is for
children. The tender thigh is reserved for the elderly for obvious
reasons. A chef explains that the best roast mutton is neither too
lean nor fat. If the former, it will have an unpleasant smell, the
latter too greasy.

At meal's end a young man and five girls hurry into the tent. At a
gesture from the man, the girls start to sing, and when they're in
full flow he proposes individual toasts to each visitor in our
group. In return, guests have to finish half a cup of the qingke
wine. Although the host's warm hospitality is difficult to refuse,
we quickly realize the the wisdom of taking only sips, for girls
follow on his heels to propose their own toasts. The good news is
that the Yugurs will not force a guest to get drunk.

Yugur women are very particular about their headwear, which
represents their marital status. Married women's headwear is often
their precious dowry, inlaid as it is with pearls, diamonds and
agates. These form various patterns on a one-metre piece of cotton
flannel, which is circled turban-like around the head, with a short
stretch hanging down the back. Unmarried women wear far less
luxurious headwear, characterized by strings of beads adorning the
forehead.

The Yugurs are divided into two major groups, known as east and
west. The groups share the same language but, verbally, use
slightly different delivery. Women's headwear is the most
noticeable difference between the two groups. The easterners wear a
flat-topped design, westerners a "pointed" design.

Fortunate tourists - alas we were unlucky - might be invited to a
local wedding ceremony, unique to the Yugurs from time immemorial.
On the eve of the wedding, the bride's family hosts a dinner during
which a few married women place new headwear on the bride while
girls sing appropriate songs. When the bride and her attendant
leave their tent home the following morning, the bride's face is
veiled by a scarf. En route to the groom's tent, the bridal party
is greeted by the groom's friends and relatives, who provide wine
and introduce those who have made preparations for the wedding. By
custom, the bride's family is allowed to be critical of the
preparations, and even turn back if dissatisfied - an embarrassment
that rarely occurs.

As the bride approaches her new tent home, a "battle" breaks out,
which ostensibly shocks the guests. Seven or eight young men on
horseback from the bride's side of the union gallop around the tent
three times in a feigned effort to collapse it. The groom and his
family remain inside in an equally feigned effort to protect it.
When the battle is over, the groom's family takes the horses from
the riders.

When the bride enters the tent's flap, the groom shoots three
harmless "arrows" at her. If one strikes, it means the couple will
forever be happy together. Then it's on with the real ceremony,
conducted by a senior member of the groom's family. The young
couple, sitting on separate sides of a carpet, first worship Buddha
and then indicate their respect for each other.

Simultaneous with the start of music and singing, guests begin to
drink. Then uncles and aunts of the bride officially hand their
niece over to the groom's family. Celebrations continue until the
last guest leaves.

Yang Yuxia, a young local tour guide, says that Yugur girls are
these days allowed to marry Han men, a practice that had always
been forbidden. The change reflects increasing cultural and social
exchanges between the two cultures.

CHINA: Same Trip Yesterday 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

PROBABLY the most famous trip ever made from Xi'an to Lhasa was
more than 1,300 years ago by a princess on her way to marry the
King of Tubo (now Tibet). As early as the seventh century, Tubo was
establishing close ties with the Tang dynasty (618-907AD), the most
prosperous in feudal China. In 614, Tubo's King Songtsan Gambo made
an offer of marriage to the Tang through Emperor Taizong, and
Princess Wencheng was selected to be the bride.

It is not difficult to imagine the hardships of such a long
(2,700km) trip, which took the princess and her handmaidens and
escorts - headed by special envoy Li Daozong - more than two years
to reach Lhasa. There, the king had renovated the Potala Palace as
a welcome to his bride.

Now, with the opening of the Xi'an-Lhasa air route, travellers can
complete the same distance in little more than the time it takes to
watch a movie, about two and half hours. Meanwhile, those who are
curious about the details of the princess' legendary trip can
retrace her route, though in far greater comfort than the princess.

Now available is a tour called "Princess Wencheng Entering Tibet,"
developed by the Tibet Tourism Bureau. Tourists are taken by road
from Xi'an to Lhasa in about two weeks. En route they make four
major stops for sightseeing and special events.

CHINA: AVIATION: Jets to Roof of World: A new air route connecting Lhasa to
Xi'an is expected to harvest tourist gold 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZHANG DAN in Xi'an, P.22-23

TOURISTS and business travellers are taking advantage of a new,
third, air route to Tibet. Recently inaugurated by China
Southwestern Airlines, the sole civil service to offer round trips
to the roof of the world, the new service is between Xi'an -
capital of northwestern Shaanxi province - and Lhasa. Its average
seat occupancy rate since starting has been 57.3 per cent.

While this rate is still almost 10 per cent below the annual
average for China's civil carriers overall, a spokesman for China
Southwestern, which ranks fourth among the country's six major
airlines, says it is confident of filling more seats during the
next peak tourism season, summer 1997. "It's a new route, and may
still be unknown to many tour and ticketing agents," he says.

The maiden Xi'an-Lhasa flight was by a 198-seat Boeing 757 which
left Xianyang International Airport, 25km north of Xi'an, with 159
passengers. Just two-and-a-half hours later it touched down at
Gongar Airport, 100km outside Lhasa. The plane returned to Xi'an
the same day with 38 passengers.

As of September 11, more than 4,000 passengers had used the new
route, whose opening gives Tibet-bound travellers both a convenient
and interesting option to China Southwestern's two established
routes. Previously, people had to choose either Chengdu, capital of
southwestern Sichuan Province, or Chongqing - also in Sichuan - as
their starting point for Lhasa. Now, those beginning their journeys
in the north, Beijing for example, are finding it more convenient
to fly from Xi'an.

In marketing potential, the airline and China's tourist agencies
value the Xi'an-Lhasa route above the two Sichuan options. After
Beijing, Xi'an is high on most tourism itineraries because of the
famous terra-cotta warriors and horses of Emperor Qin Shihuang,
dating back 2,200 years.

This acknowledged wonder of the world helps make Xi'an one of the
country's most popular tourist destinations. In 1995, it received
nearly 400,000 international visitors, a number that is growing by
seven per cent every year. Meanwhile, at the other end of the
route, Lhasa, with its splendid Potala Palace, is an irresistible
attraction to countless tourists. Last year, Tibet received more
than 30,000 international tourists. It expects some five per cent
more this year.

Golden Route: China Southwestern press officer Yi Shizhong says the
airline is actively promoting the new flight to international and
domestic travel agencies and ticketing agents. "We believe it will
become a golden tourism route" - a view confirmed by the fact that
several Chinese airlines competed for the Xi'an-Lhasa licence. The
Civil Aviation Administration of China's decision to grant it to
China Southwestern was due to the airline's 40-year, accident-free
record in flying over the Tibetan Plateau, where blizzards and
jagged snow-clad peaks combine to test the nerve of pilots. "We
impose the strictest safety regulations to ensure that our flights
over the 'third pole on the planet' are safe," says Yi. "Four
decades of safe flying speaks for itself."

To date, the airline has made more than 24,000 flights to and from
Tibet, carrying a total of 2.8 million passengers and 10,000 tons
of freight.

Since 1994, China Southwestern has opened two other Tibet air
routes. One of them, Chengdu to Bangda in eastern Tibet, was made
possible by the construction of an airport encircled by 4,000m-high
mountains. The other is Chongqing-Lhasa. Prior to 1994, the airline
had only two routes: Chengdu-Lhasa and Lhasa-Kathmandu, the capital
of Nepal.

At present, the airline operates 44 Boeing 757 flights a week on
five routes over Tibet. "They are the newest and most reliable
planes in [our] fleet," says Yi. Some 300,000 passengers per year
fly China Southwestern to and from Tibet, a vast increase against
the services' early years.

Independent tourists: Yi believes the new Xi'an-Lhasa service will
further promote Tibet's economic and tourism growth. However, for
foreign independent tourists, visiting Tibet isn't simply a case of
buying and flying. A little planning and paperwork is necessary in
advance.

According to the Tibetan Autonomous Region's tourism bureau - "to
ensure foreign tourists' safety in Tibet" - international tourists
must travel in organized groups with special visas. Ticketing
agents can decline to sell air tickets to Tibet to individual
travellers without proper visas.

Tibet-bound visas: There are more than 40 travel agencies in Tibet
with government authority to receive tourists organized by their
business partners abroad. These agencies are responsible for
notifying Chinese embassies in foreign countries to issue visas
directly to Tibet-bound tourist groups.

But, for the convenience of independent tourists already in China
who wish to visit Tibet and may be unaware of the restriction, the
Tibetan Tourism Bureau has opened information offices in Chengdu,
Xi'an and Golmud, a railhead in northwestern Qinghai province where
overland travellers transfer to buses for the long onward ride to
Lhasa. There is also an office in Kathmandu. All these offices can
issue visas on the spot to foreign travel agents and foreign
independent tourists who have grouped together, after necessary
contacts have been made with local Tibetan agencies.

"In principle, Tibet doesn't allow nor receive individual
international tourists," says an official of the Tibetan Tourism
Bureau. "However, quite a number of them just travel overland from
ports on the China-Nepal border or Golmud." The local government
urges such tourists, who often display their adventurous spirit by
managing to travel across the formidable but challenging Tibetan
Plateau by bus - or even bicycle - to form groups upon their
arrival in Lhasa. To provide for their likely needs, a special
travel agency was set up in 1994. Called Lhasa Minjian (meaning
non-official) Travel Agency, the unit can make travel arrangements
for their further exploration of Tibet.

"A lot of individual international travellers come and go without
letting us know," comments a Tibetan tourism bureau official,
surmising that most are either unaware of the regulations or
worried that the procedure for obtaining a special visa is too
complicated

However, because Tibetans are eager to boost their tourism industry
and enrich the regional economy, they interpret the term "tourist
group" in the most-flexible way possible. "As a matter of fact, as
few as two people can make up a group," observes one official, "so
it's not a difficult thing.

CHINA: POLICY: Opening up In a New Era: China stays open to foreign funds,
with some policy adjustments 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From Chen Gengtao in Beijing, P.20-21

SEVENTEEN years into the country's opening to the outside world,
more and more Chinese can barely get through a day without using
something whose origin was in a foreign land. They may ride in a
Santana car to work, make long-distance calls with a Motorola
cellular phone, drink Beck's beer and wash their hair with Lux
shampoo.

These products have two things in common: they are all foreign
brands, and they are all made in China - mostly by joint ventures,
a few by wholly-owned foreign manufacturers. The car, for example,
is made by Germany's Volkswagen and its Chinese partner in
Shanghai.

The open policy advocated by retired leader Deng Xiaoping, and
vigorously implemented by the government over the years, has
benefited the Chinese as well as their country. More than 17
million people have found generally well-paid jobs in foreign-
funded enterprises, increasing numbers of them now boasting US
dollar accounts in the bank. Products they consume and use,
including table wines, toothbrushes, shoes, elevators, televisions
and cars, are of far better quality than ever before.

Thanks partly to the presence of foreign businesses which have
brought with them investment capital, technology and management
expertise, the Chinese economy has been able to grow at an annual
average rate of 12 per cent in the last five years. In 1995 alone,
foreign-funded enterprises paid close to 70 billion yuan (US$8.4
billion) in taxes, almost one-tenth of national tax revenues. Also
last year, with its total imports and exports amounting to $280
billion, China ranked 10th among the world's top trading nations.

Its dramatic emergence as a trading nation is due largely to its
open policy: foreign-funded enterprises accounted for about 40 per
cent of total imports and exports last year. In the first quarter
of this year, they rose to 45.9 per cent. And by May this year,
China's foreign exchange reserves reached $85 billion.

The open policy is one of two legs with which China is to achieve
modernization, according to Deng Xiaoping's design. The other leg
is economic reform, which has entered the phase of establishing a
market economy. As China begins to execute its 9th Five-Year Plan
this year, and with the 21st century only five years away, the
government has formulated a development programme covering the next
15 years - a blueprint adopted by the National People's Congress at
its general session last March.

Wider opening: Consistent with the open policy, the programme lays
down a number of principles for the future, the most general one
being to "open wider to the outside world," as Premier Li Peng told
the NPC. Says Lin Qihui, an official of the Special Economic Zones
Office under the central government: "This means primarily that
China will increase its openness in terms of geographical area and
business scope.

"Geographically, we will promote more foreign investment in cities
along major transport lines, and establish foreign investment zones
in provincial capitals. In [terms of] business scope, we will
gradually allow foreign businesses to play a greater role in fields
where they have been more or less restricted, such as mining,
banking, retailing and insurance."

Another principle is to "improve quality" in the actual
implementation of the open policy. This, according to Lin, means
broadening the economic efficiency and returns of all projects
involving foreign investment. Simply, China will become choosier in
approving new projects. "[Those] that use new and high technologies
will be encouraged, and those which pollute the environment
rejected," Lin says, adding that the administration and taxation of
foreign-funded enterprises will be reinforced.

Other major principles include the operation of foreign-funded
investments in accordance with market economics, with future growth
relying mainly on improved management and the use of advanced
technologies rather than on the launching of more projects.

Tariff slash: Preferential policies too will be substituted by
"increasing the vitality" of enterprises, thus giving them the
impetus for future growth. Indeed, from April 1 this year, foreign-
funded enterprises have no longer enjoyed tax exemptions on
imported manufacturing equipment. China has also slashed its tariff
rates from an average 35.9 per cent to 23 per cent.

Economists predict that the revocation of preferential treatment
will not affect foreign-funded operations that rely mainly on
technology. But it will create difficulties for those that have all
along relied mainly on tax breaks for profits. Revocation of these
breaks also means that Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises now
compete on an equal footing, the government says.

With political stability and a huge market, China is confident of
its continued attraction to foreign investors. The government
expects to receive a further $150 billion in foreign direct
investment in the next five years. That is big money indeed, though
a continued influx of such investment is seen as but a natural
widening of foreign interest in China over the past 17 years.

By the end of 1995, China had approved a total of 260,000 foreign-
funded enterprises, almost half of which have gone into operation.
Aggregate foreign investment reached $135 billion, making China the
world's second-largest recipient after the United States.

Coastal zones: Over the years, China has established five Special
Economic Zones along its coast, opened Pudong New Area - a
Singapore-size piece of land wedged between the East China Sea and
Shanghai proper - and established Suzhou Industrial Park, also near
Shanghai, with the Singapore Government as its partner. (Window,
August 9) All have become major centres of foreign investment.

Also playing host to foreign largesse are 32 state-level economic
and technological development zones, mainly in coastal cities. Many
of them have become economic powerhouses, too. In the economic and
technological development zone of Tianjin, a port city in north
China, for example, America's Motorola has been making pagers and
cellular phones in huge quantities and will soon make computer
phones and chips. Its investment in the zone has reached $1
billion.

Foreign-funded operations can now in fact be found almost
everywhere across the country, from Xinjiang in the far northwest
to Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Tibet to Inner Mongolia.
Thanks to paramount leader Deng's open policy, the PRC has become
increasingly economically integrated with the rest of the world.
Now, with the "open wider" policy adopted by the government, there
seems no limit to what the country can achieve in the future.

CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Qian Misquoted: Distortion of
what Qian said during interview: From a commentary in the Ta Kung Pao,
October 18 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

IN REPLY to questions from staff reporters of the Asian Wall Street
Journal as to whether demonstrations to commemorate the June 4
incident be allowed in Hong Kong after 1997, Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said: "Hong Kong should not hold those
political activities which directly interfere in the affairs of the
mainland of China."

On the question of Hong Kong media being critical of Chinese
politics or leaders, Qian replied: "They can put forward criticism,
but not rumours or lies. Nor can they put forward personal attacks
on Chinese leaders."

As it is clear from the context of the report, Qian said no more
than to reiterate China's consistent position of implementing the
"one country, two systems" scenario and the principle of Hong Kong
people ruling Hong Kong.

But it should be remembered the vital importance of respect for the
rule of law and the counsel of "keeping well water and river water
separate" if the "one country, two systems" scenario is not to be
undermined.

While it is important that the mainland should not interfere in the
capitalist system and way of life in Hong Kong, nor should Hong
Kong interfere in the mainland's socialist system. Respect for each
other provides the space for each to conduct their affairs in their
own way.

Enshrined in the Basic Law, the letter and spirit of these
principles, are accepted by the vast majority of Hong Kong people.

In reiterating these principle, Qian had no intention of suggesting
that the China is tightening its control of Hong Kong. There is no
cause to stir up a storm in a teacup from what Qian told the staff
reporters of the AWSJ.

The incident of Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe and the media fervour
it created in Hong Kong is blatantly a case of interfering in
China's internal affairs. Moreover it also violated the territory's
immigration laws.

CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Time to Move: It is time to
seek return of the Diaoyus: From an editorial in the Sing Tao Daily News,
October 16 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By GERALD CHEN, P.19

SO FAR the moderate stance maintained by Beijing with regard to the
Diaoyu issland issue has caused considerable misunderstanding among
Chinese within China as well as abroad. Under these circumstances,
we were heartened by news conveyed recently by Hong Kong members of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from top
Chinese leaders that Beijing is prepared "to lose a thousand ounces
of gold, rather than give in an inch to territory" - quoting a
Chinese proverb. This reassuring message can be understood to mean
that all necessary strategic precautions have been put in place by
China.

It was disclosed that Chia did not refrain from from demanding the
immediate return of the Diaoyus for economic reasons. More
important, it was because of the wrongful involvement of the US in
the Diaoyus issue that a settlement must wait until "an appropriate
time," although it is still unknown when that appropriate time
would be.

In his written reply to the Japanese media last week, Chinese Vice-
Premier (and foreign minister) Qian Qichen stated that in both
agreements signed between China and Japan in l972 and 1978 it was
agreed that the Diaoyu issued should be shelved and its settlement
should be left to posterity. This commitment was the greatest
hindrance to efforts seeking the return of the Diaoyus.

But now that Japan has categorically denied that there ever was
such an understanding, it stands to reason that China no longer
need to feel bound by any commitment and would be in a position to
seek the return of these islands. Indeed, it might be taken as a
sign of weakness to be taken advantage of by Japan if China were to
continue with its hitherto mild stance on the issue.

It is true that China must tread carefully because of the US
involvement. However, as one can gather from the US spokesman's
statements on the subject, Washington does not wish to get further
involved in this issue, most probably because it has realized its
mistake in placing the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawa
in 1971.

The present international climate makes it mandatory for
territorial disputes to be resolved without the use of armed force.
In the case of the Diaoyus, resorting to the use of force can only
give Japan additional excuse to expand its military build-up, which
would not be in interest of regional stability.

Many are in China's favour in its dispute with Japan over the
Diaoyus if the issue is sorted out without the use of force.
Historians know that the Diaoyus used to be under the jurisdiction
of Taiwan. The island group never had anything to do with Okinawa
at all. This is not only because the Diaoyus were formally
designated as a part of Taiwan in 1862; evidence of this can also
be found in Okinawan and Japanese  history books.

Japan most probably first decided to seize the Diaoyus in 1894,
although it was the Shimonoseki Treaty signed at the end of Sino-
Japanese War of 1895 which ended in China's humiliating defeat that
put the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawa. Taiwan was
also annexed by Japan as a result of the Shimonoseki Treaty.

When the US took over Okinawa after World War II, the Diaoyus were
also considered within the administration of Okinawa. Okinawa and
the Diaoyus were "handed back" to Japan by virtue of an US-Japanese
agreement signed in 1971.

The point is, Japan's claim to the Diaoyus was already nullified
because the unequally Shimonoseki Treaty had been abolished (by the
Cairo Agreement of 1943 and the Potsdam Agreement of 1945). There
is no legal basis whatsoever to Japan's sovereign claim to the
Diaoyu islands.

Although, properly speaking, administration of the Diaoyus should
still belong to Taiwan, it stands to reason that any diplomatic
effort seeking the return of these islands can only be conducted by
China with Japan.

No doubt Japan is not about to give up it claim to the Diaoyus
easily.

But all reason is on China's side, in the light of international
laws and otherwise, even if the issue goes before international
tribunal.

COMMENTARY: BACKSTREET JAPAN: Child Abuse 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By R.J. GUTHRIE, P.18

UNSOLICITED solicitations in the daily post for everything from
home-delivered masseuses to bargain leases on BMWs is another
unwelcome sign of Japan's wealth. Many make interesting reading.
Some are downright scary, like a recent deluxe mailing telling me
about a pre-kindergarten for one-year-olds. Since our youngest is
in his third year at university I almost threw it away. But then I
noticed the glossy colour pictures showing something that looked
more like an upscale athletic club than a creche. So I read its
pitch.

It seems this particular school is telling Japanese mothers that
it's never too young to get on the education treadmill; that their
children should start learning something now and begin mastering
those particular skills eventually needed to get them accepted by
Tokyo or Waseda universities. Some may call this progress. I tend
to see it as child abuse, and another example of a society blessed
with more money than sense.

Preschool education has been a big business in Japan for quite some
time and has become a lucrative business for entrepreneurs more
concerned with bottom lines than children. At last count, there
were 8,600 privately run kindergartens in Japan with 77,800
teachers and an enrolment of 1.47 million.. This is more than four
times the number of public-run facilities.

Some of the "top rated" kindergartens have unofficial ties with
universities in that X kindergarten is a stepping stone to X
elementary school, then X middle school, and finally X high school
leading to entrance in X university 15 years later. These
kindergartens can cost up to US$1,300 to $2,000 per month,
including "unofficial" and supplemental fees, and entrance is as
competitive as it is at Oxford or Harvard.

Education mamas: Sound ridiculous? Well, it doesn't to Japan's
millions of kyoikyu (education) mamas, the hybrid Japanese noun
used to describe and decry those mothers whose sole purpose in life
is to ensure their children pass the entrance examinations at a top
university. These are the mothers that send their six-year-old to
juku or privately run cram schools for around three hours a day
after school, six and sometimes seven days a week.

The accent is not on personal enlargement or even acquiring
knowledge. Rather it is on rote mastery of the material of and ways
needed to pass entrance examinations to the more desirable schools
that requires living for 15 years in the "examination hell'" as the
Japanese themselves call this process. This disquieting phenomenon
has now, it seems, filtered down to the toddler level.

Kiysohi Takara, a clinical psychologist, recently published a book
with the rather ponderous title Warning! Dangerous Preschool
Education - A Clinical Report condemning the sort of services being
provided by the kindergarten that sent me its glossy catalogue. Dr
Takara says that while education at a young age is not the only
cause of children's problems, it does cause them to lose any spirit
of independence. It puts heavy pressure on them and drives them on
to a sort of mental treadmill. Parents are forcing their young
children to become "smart" and the children feel an immense
pressure to do what they are being told - to live up to "A-grade"
expectations at their kindergartens, for example. This, in turn,
places a terrible burden on the parent-child relationship. As
preschool education drives children to go faster and higher than
others, they lose self-confidence in the process and feel more
restless. This accumulates a tremendous amount of stress and more
and more children are even "losing the ability to cry as an SOS
signal."

Other, equally respected experts have been saying for years that
children who are forced to use their brains too much in the early
stages of development lack emotional stability. There are dozens of
published case studies on three-year-olds suffering from stress.
This is disturbing, even in a country where dying of overwork is
officially classified as an "occupational hazard."

Even more worrying is that a vast number of parents see nothing
basically wrong with the present accent on education, and believe
that schooling is the means to all desirable ends. As Japan's
wealth has multiplied and the extended family declined, many
parents have abrogated their responsibilities for child-rearing to
the schools. Whatever the reason, the young people today are
worrying their elders like never before. The first, spoiled progeny
of Japan's economic boom and the sons and daughters of the
prototype "education mamas" are now in their early twenties. They
see themselves as Japan's first "lost generation."

Several immensely popular television shows make big advertising
dollars by making fun of them. One regularly spotlights fashionable
young women who take an almost perverse pride in not being able to
boil an egg or fry rice. While presented as comedy, such shows are
giving a once-satisfied older generation another reason to worry
about where they have gone wrong.

Critics more serious than those who appear on television - which in
Japan includes your average cabdriver, bottle washer, and noodle
cook - see the rise of the Aum Shinrikyo subway-gassers and dozens
of less homicidal yet equally strange cults as natural outgrowths
of fallen educational and parental values.

Today's younger people feel a spirit-sucking emotional and
philosophical vacuum in modern Japan. Most of my son's more
intelligent friends have no intention of becoming part of the
economic juggernaut that their elders worked so hard to build. I
like to think this is a hopeful sign, and that tomorrow's Japan
will be a lot more human, a little more green, and a lot less self-
centred. I do know for certain that none of them will ever dream of
sending their one-year-olds to a fast-track kindergarten.

COMMENTARY: WINDOW FORUM: Arrogance of a Ruler 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.16

SZE CHEUNG PANG: Member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and one of the earliest investors in China.
Sze is an authority on economic development in China and Hong Kong
and has published many articles on the subject.

SOON after Governor Chris Patten came to Hong Kong, he pushed for
political reform and set in motion a Sino-British argument. This
was condemned by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser,
writing in an Australian newspaper, who said that Patten was trying
to teach China how to manage its own country, and pointing out
Patten's ulterior and destructive intention.

Patten immediately rebutted, explaining that he only wished to
stage a "fair election," and not teach China how to administer. But
Patten completely forgets this statement and continues to dictate
to China how it should manage the Hong Kong Special Administrative
region. The degree of arrogance and ignorance is simply beyond
forbearance.

Patten uses the term "successor" throughout his policy address for
the first chief executive of the SAR. This is also a demonstration
of utter stupidity. The resumption of sovereignty of China over
Hong Kong means an absolute end of British colonial rule, and a
start of a new era for Hong Kong.

There is nothing in the handover that suggests a political nature
of continuance or succession between the governor and the SAR chief
executive. Handover of sovereignty is to be carried out between
Britain and China, and the first chief executive will receive his
authority from China, and not from the governor.

Patten's statement violates the rules governing the handing over of
Hong Kong's authority as stipulated in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration. He is continuing to stir up public opinion on
"returning rule to Hong Kong people."

Patten's rule of Hong Kong is not up to standard. He is therefore
not qualified to talk about "Hong Kong's success story" or "the
principles of governing Hong Kong."

Basic Law guide: Furthermore, he deliberates on the necessity of
China signing two international covenants. This is absurd. In his
policy address, he listed out 10 key elements for future SAR plans
and 16 benchmarks for judging the future Hong Kong. The chief
executive has the Basic Law as guiding principles of
administration; the Basic Law is also the best benchmark for
appraisal. The 10 elements and the 16 benchmarks are already
embodied in the Basic Law.

In the section on the 16 benchmarks, Patten let himself go and in
many places talks about "pressure by Peking; "objectives dictated
by Peking" and makes other high-sounding but meaningless points. He
speaks as if the decisive factor for Hong Kong's future success
lies in whether it can act against Beijing. His ulterior motive is
obvious, and is particularly strong at this moment when his leaving
is imminent.

Patten refers to Hong Kong's autonomy several times in the policy
address. He says that before Britain leaves Hong Kong, it, besides
trying its best to retain a certain value, will also strive to make
sure that Hong Kong will enjoy autonomy in social and economic
affairs as at present.

He also insists, "my anxiety is this: not that this community's
autonomy would be usurped by Peking, but that it could be given
away bit by bit by some people in Hong Kong," and calls on Hong
Kong people to "defend and assert" for autonomy. An English
governor, endowed with absolute power to fulfil colonial rule in
Hong Kong, deliberates on autonomy!

Slave-master: This is just like a slave-master talking about
autonomy to his slaves, and is the most ludicrous farce under
heaven. It is simply deceptive to say that Hong Kong has autonomy.
Hong Kong people don't even have the right to elect their governor,
and final judicial judgement lies with Britain; where does autonomy
comes in?

Hong Kong will have autonomy only after its return to China. At
present there does not exist a problem as to who has ruined Hong
Kong's autonomy. Hong Kong's autonomy is granted by China, so there
would not be a problem of its being "usurped by Peking." Patten
bases these opinions on visits by some Hong Kong people to Beijing,
which he calls "surreptitious appeal" or "closed-door lobbying,"
and that "it draws Chinese officials into matters which should fall
squarely within the autonomy of Hong Kong."

This is simply absurd. It is in Hong Kong people's interest to
stand by the Chinese Government to counteract the damage and
interruption caused by Patten on Hong Kong's smooth transition.
This is fair and embodies Hong Kong people's responsibility as
masters of the place. We who have been under colonial rule will no
longer be submissive subjects at Britain's beck and call. In the
eyes of Patten, this is the worst heresy. This clearly reveals his
true picture as a guardian of colonialism.

That an ignorant and arrogant British politician has a chance to
fan flames of disorder at the final stage of Hong Kong's transition
is in itself a misfortune brought about by history.

What is fortunate is that Hong Kong people are more and more aware
of the real colours of Patten, and have completely forsaken him.

Lu Xun, a great Chinese author, once said: "Some people wish to be
immortal, but rot more quickly than the earth." Patten is exactly
such a figure.

HONGKONG: HEALTH: Patten Dogged by UK Rabies Control Law: Pet pooches face
long confinement 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.15

CHRIS Patten has once again been accused of exploiting his position
as governor of Hong Kong in order to intervene in British politics
- this time on behalf of his pet dogs Whisky and Soda.

In November last year Patten backed UK tax cuts and the
Conservative Party's lurch to the right in a move seemingly in
contradiction of his required neutrality as a civil servant. The
comments led to calls for his resignation.

And last week the governor threw himself into UK politics for a
second time when he gave a high-profile interview in which he
called for the scrapping of quarantine laws aimed at keeping the
killer disease rabies out of Britain.

Patten had made remarks critical of quarantine in the past - and in
May he was accused of making a personal plea to former cabinet
colleagues for a change in the law, the details of which Window can
now confirm.

The governor's most recent outburst followed the revelation that
British agriculture minister Douglas Hogg had proposed a review of
the world's toughest rabies controls, in force since 1901.

Passports: Details of the proposed move to a "passports-for-pets"
scheme - featuring strict vaccination and blood testing and animal
identification by means of implanted microchips - were circulated
to cabinet ministers last month. And when the controversial plan
was later leaked to the press, Patten popped up to endorse it.

"Like thousands of diplomats, service and business families around
the world, I feel the present British quarantine rules are
preposterous," he told The Times in an interview conducted on
October 13. "And yes, I have told the prime minister what I think."

Patten added: "There is just no scientific basis for them and they
risk cruelty to animals. But with new safeguards we can get rid of
the rules without undermining public health."

Unfortunately for the governor and his two Norfolk terriers, even
the reformers envisage abandoning quarantine only for European
Union countries and rabies-free islands such as Cyprus and Malta.
And though Hong Kong is notionally rabies free, it is no island.

Desperate to win his pampered pooches a reprieve from the
compulsory six-months behind bars - cost around 2,000 (HK$24,000)
per dog - Patten was moved to call for the extension of the scheme
world-wide.

"I think it would be very curious if they applied it just to the EU
and not generally," he said. "Provided the animals carry a
microchip, have been inoculated, have a certificate, and are tested
on arrival in Britain, it should not make too much difference which
country they come from."

In its front-page article, The Times also indicated that Patten
hoped Britain would reach cross-party consensus on the issue before
his dogs were forced into kennels next summer, while Government
House sought to make light of his remarks. "The governor has
basically said the same thing over and over again," said a
spokesman. "And though he's definitely going to bring Whisky and
Soda back to UK, he understands that any change in the law will be
too late for him."

Perhaps - but a personal approach made by Patten earlier this year
and reported in The Spectator on May 25 suggests that he will not
give up that easily. Discussing the quarantine debate, the magazine
remarked: "The word in Westminster is that Patten has been making
noises on the subject to Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine."

Window can now reveal that those "noises" were made when the
governor was visiting Britain and had a private chat with
Heseltine, during which he suggested that diplomats and others
should be partly exempt from the quarantine law.

Says a source: "What Patten wanted was some sort of fast-track
through quarantine of the type being demanded by army officers
serving in Cyprus. They seem to think they are more deserving than
- let us say - the 70,000 Britons living in Spain."

Significantly, new government pointers this week suggest that a
universal fast-track quarantine of just two months is under
consideration, and that Patten may get his way - although whether
any changes could be made before next June is debatable. Either
way, the governor's stance on the issue has already made him new
enemies in Britain, with Guy Tamplin, chairman of the Quarantine
Kennel Owners Association, accusing him of a "gross misuse of his
public position."

Says Tamplin: "He's abusing his job to campaign in his own
interests. And he's a government appointee, so it's not even as if
he can claim to be expressing the views of constituents. Let's hope
he didn't employ public funds or time in pursuing this personal
crusade."

"One of the animals once went missing for four days," he recalls.
"And the other was locked up for biting someone. On top of that
there is virulent hook worm in Hong Kong, so I don't think their
case is very strong." Tamplin also calls into question the
effectiveness of anti-rabies vaccines, claiming that in many cases
they fail to produce enough antibodies. Yet his objections will
count for little if the Ministry of Agriculture has made up its
mind.

But though new legislation may be in the pipeline, Patten must
place Whisky and Soda in kennels in January to be sure of a July
reunion. And as the pair will be required for myriad photo
opportunities when he resumes his political career, their early
departure still seems likely.

HONGKONG: WELFARE: Home-alone Law Plea: Handover hampers Legco
deliberations 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JUANITO CONCEPCION, P.14

WHEN home-alone Chan Chi-ho, aged five, almost burned to death a
week ago in a padlocked public housing flat in Kwai Chung, the
community was understandably outraged - rightly feeling that
locking up small children and leaving them unattended, even for a
short period, is unforgivable because it is a blatantly
irresponsible invitation to tragedy.

Despite the appalling burns to 60 per cent of the child's body and
the collective outrage it generated, chances are that a similar or
even more serious accident will occur in coming months, warn child
welfare activists. For Chan was far from the first child to be left
in such a situation, witness the prosecutions and resultant wide
publicity of recent years, but some parents never learn.

Activists' fears stem from three major factors: the ineptitude of
relevant government departments, glaring loopholes in different
pieces of legislation on child welfare and protection, and the
irresponsibility of parents themselves.

Under current laws, a parent or guardian who leaves a child
unattended is not liable to any penalty, even if the victim dies or
is injured in an accident - serious or otherwise.

Grey area: Says Cynthia Luk, division supervisor at St James
Settlement: "It's [the practice of leaving children unattended] a
grey area, and it's not prosecutable right now because it doesn't
fall under any ordinance. Unless it's defined clearly in the law as
a form of child abuse, I don't think there will be a strong and
effective deterrent against this malpractice." She says St James
has yet to firm up its position on this issue.

In the past, the group has always advocated education rather than
prosecution as a more effective tool in addressing problematic
issues. The volunteer agency believes that prosecuting erring
parents can be counter-productive as it can generate their
hostility and anger, and make reunion with their children more
difficult.

Luk concedes, however, that while some parents change through
education, others do not respond despite reminders and warnings of
the consequences of leaving their children unattended. "There are
hindrances in Chinese society and culture in resolving problems
involving parents and their children," she says. "Chinese people
are moderate, and very reluctant to resort to legal action.

"If legislation is passed, the consequences of penalties that would
be imposed on adults, or the parents, would have to be carefully
considered as they may adversely affect the welfare and interests
of their children."

The community's ambivalence over this issue was clearly
demonstrated when the government sponsored a public consultation
more than a year ago on how home-alone children could best be
protected. Luk recalls that the consultation exercise failed to
produce a consensus on a way forward.

Against-Child-Abuse director Priscilla Lui argues that the act of
leaving children unattended should fall under neglect - one of the
four classifications of child abuse currently punishable under the
law. The others embrace the physical, psychological and sexual.

However, the Home Affairs Branch is reluctant to define home-alone
situations as a form of child abuse, Lui asserts. HAB is
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the package of
legislation, passed in July last year on child care and protection.

She says: "Nobody wants to penalize anybody, especially if a home-
alone child dies. Nobody wants to impose a further burden on the
party who is responsible for a tragedy. What we're saying is that
defining home-alone situations doesn't mean jailing anybody. It's
simply putting a problem in focus which can be likened to a doctor
making a diagnosis that helps him determine the right remedy to a
medical problem."

She stresses the importance of classifying home-alone cases as a
form of child abuse because it will set a baseline in the community
on how young children should properly be taken care of. "Our real
intention is to see better and more effective protection for
children, not erring parents and child minders being placed behind
bars."

ACA has recommended an increase in the options for punishing erring
parents and guardians of home-alone children. These include advice
or reprimand; payment of fines; rendering community service; and
jail.

Luk complains that Hong Kong, unlike the US, Canada and other
Western countries, does not have comprehensive legislation for
protecting and promoting the rights of children, as well as
vigorously tackling the problem of child abuse.

As Legco's agenda is full for its final session before next year's
handover, the prospects of it adopting new legislation that
addresses the home-alone problem does not look promising, says Luk.

ACA's Lui concurs, even as she laments the seemingly high level of
tolerance among policymakers and the community over tragic the
tragic incidence of children being badly injured while locked up at
home and left unattended by their parents or guardians.

At its 13th conference in Geneva early this month, the United
Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child attacked Hong Kong's
poor record in protecting and promoting the rights of children. The
UK, a signatory to the (separate) UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child, filed a report on behalf of Hong Kong.

Legco also slammed the government's shortcomings in a report it
tabled at the Geneva conference which criticized the government's
statistics on child abuse and neglect as incomplete and
uncoordinated. It is thus doubtful if the figures, says the report,
"present a true picture of the problem."

The Legco report also quoted the coroner's 1994 statistics which
showed there were 113 deaths between 1989 and 1994 involving
unattended children under the age of nine.

HONGKONG: EDUCATION: Instilling the Blithe Spirit of Learning: Plan to
drive boredom out of classroom 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By ANNA YUE, P.12-13

A BLACKBOARD revolution is set to sweep over the curriculum for
local secondary school students - a wide-ranging Education
Department initiative to make their studies more fun, thus more
effective. As a result, bored-with-school youngsters could find
themselves chalking up far better grades than ever before.

The fun-factor innovation was disclosed by Brenda Lo, secretary of
a department steering committee set up in mid-1993 to "coordinate
the design and implementation of appropriate curricula and related
activities to promote pleasurable and effective learning" - a
concept whose various components are geared towards the common goal
of making learning a happier experience.

A joint survey by the Education Department and the University of
Hong Kong's curriculum studies department of 610 students from all
types of school shows that only 30 per cent of secondary pupils
find studying enjoyable. Sixty per cent describe it as "OK," while
the remainder confess to being unhappy about studying anyway.

The majority of respondents agree that a school's study environment
and the relationship between friends, family members and teachers
can greatly affect their study mood. The most important factors
affecting their motivation to study were the teaching method and
atmosphere of the school.

Experiences: Conducted in 1994, the survey was in two parts. In the
first, students were asked to list and rank their pleasant and
unpleasant experiences, and factors leading to them. Questionnaires
for the second part were set according to the results of the first.
The final report of the survey, still under review, will be
produced late next month. Its release will coincide with a November
29 seminar for secondary school principals and teachers who will
discuss the findings and share experiences on the promotion of
pleasurable and effective learning.

Lo emphasizes that the focus of the survey was both how much
students enjoy studying, and how effectively they learn - both
aspects being of equal importance. She says there is a chance the
Education Department will change the design of the curriculum to
reinforce students' learning motive, and make studying fun. "This
is exactly the goal of the survey," she says. "Because it found
that the relationship with friends and teachers can influence
students' interest in learning, we would bear these factors in mind
when redesigning the curriculum to make learning fun and effective
for them."

Betty Wong, who has taught Form 1-4 at Chinese Holiness College for
three years, believes many students do not find studying
pleasurable because of off-school attractions such as karaoke and
video games. "Another reason is related to the problems that
teachers face. The curriculum is often boring and difficult, and
not many teachers are able to make it lively for students," she
says. "Teachers have a very heavy workload; apart from teaching,
there is a huge amount of administrative work, so there is no time
left to prepare interesting, motivating material for students."

Wong also points to parent-child relationships as a cause of
students' lack of motivation. Many of her own students have no
siblings. "They are neglected by parents, and usually brought up by
grandparents. They are spoiled and lack discipline. During class,
some day-dream and others talk or sleep." She feels that such
children lack self-confidence, and are deserving of the concern and
encouragement of teachers.

She recalls a successful case with a student who had a poor
academic record. After he was charged with organizing some extra-
curricular activities, his self-esteem greatly improved -
triggering pleasure in his studies and better academic results.

Ankey Wun, a teacher for six years and currently involved in
teacher-training for target-oriented curricula, agrees there are
many reasons for students' inability to learn happily and
effectively. For example, the Education Department's limited
resources restrict secondary students with poor academic records
from repeating a grade more than twice. "Some students need to
repeat more than this," he argues, "but as the system does not
allow it, they cannot catch up in an upper form. This adversely
affects their enjoyment of study."

Wun also points to the transitory teenage years, when boys and
girls are developing independence. "But the Hong Kong educational
system does not encourage independent thinking," he says. "This
limits their strengths and preferences, such as creativity. As they
are not allowed to develop independence in school, it leads to
dissatisfaction." He notes that as many teachers do not hold
education certificates, they may not know the correct way to teach
effectively.

Wun's solution: a more flexible curriculum, which is part of his
role in his current post in aiming to improve the level of
happiness and effectiveness in learning. Under target-oriented
curricula - at present restricted to primary students - youngsters
are taught through activities such as games and competitions, using
examples from daily life to better explain concepts and ideas.

Ultimately, it is believed, students' interests are aroused and
their performance improved. Wun says the Education Department plans
to introduce this method to secondary schools in 2001. Meanwhile,
he hopes more clerks can be employed to relieve teachers'
administrative burdens.

Student view: Window spoke with various secondary students
including, during his mid-morning break, Daniel Kwan, who is in F2
at Kowloon Wah Yan College. Kwan says he is happy with school life,
and particularly delighted with the new-found freedom he finds at
secondary level. "In primary school there were so many restrictions
and lots of regimentation, like forming proper lines to go into
assembly" he recalls. "But now that I'm here, I'm free. I don't
have to queue any more, which I always hated."

He also enjoys classes because "teachers are very humorous and
often tell jokes, which make us laugh. I enjoy studying [here]
since the environment is very good. The teachers are concerned
about us, and talk to us individually to see if we are coping with
our studies. And there is a quiet library when we want to study,
and a basketball court, soccer pitch and swimming pool when we want
to play with our classmates, who are also our friends." Kwan admits
his parents pressure him about his studies, but says his
relationship with them is good.

In contrast to Kwan, Wong Wing Ho and Dan Ny Luk - F1 students at
Chong Gene Hang College - view their study environment merely as
"OK" because they are unhappy with some schoolmates' behaviour.
"When we queue for lunch at the canteen, some of them always jump
ahead of us," complains Wong. Adds Dan: "Some often chat with each
other during class, and this interrupts our learning process
because the teachers have to stop teaching to scold them."

Monica Wan, an F7 science student at St Gloria Girls' School, also
classifies learning as "OK," claiming the tight syllabus of the
HKCEE and A-levels "suffocate" her. "Both public exams require me
to digest a large volume of information within a very short time,"
she says. "Unfortunately, some teachers do not have the patience to
teach. They just prepare a whole bunch of written material and ask
us to read it by ourselves. It's really hard to learn without their
guidance. But as an upper form student, I think I should learn to
study independently."

Noting that most of her science teachers are male, she wonders if
they know how to express concern toward students. This said, she is
happy with her relationships with her family and classmates.

F3 students Joey Lau and Fiona Leung of True Light Girls' College
say their school life is "below average" since they think their
school too small and because there are many dictation sessions,
mini-exams and other tests every week.

Agreeing that a school's teaching methods affect their study
motivation, they say: "Some teachers give daily life examples,
personal experiences and even tell stories to explain ideas. This
makes studying fun. But some teachers just read straight from
books."

HONGKONG: WELFARE: Elderly Not Fed Up With Daily Allowance: Life at the
bottom on SWD allocation 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BETSY MAY VELOO, P.10-11

IT IS as far a cry from a banquet as you can get when 75-year-olds
Ng Hing-sing and friend Pang Chak-kui seat themselves at a small
table in the former's tiny Shek Kip Mei flat and dig into their
evening meal - rice with hints of scrambled egg and tomatoes, and a
shared four-cm sliver of salted fish left over from some days
before.

No soup, gentlemen? "It would cost $40 to $50 if we made soup,"
says Ng. "We will wait until there are more friends with us, then I
can cook soup" - shorthand for the poverty-line reality that making
a pan of soup is a finely balanced economic proposition as much as
a nutritional need. But that's how you think when the daily food
allowance doled out to you by the Social Welfare Department is
calculated at $23 per day - or $7.60 a meal.

The diners had bought their eggs for a dollar apiece, though they
could have saved a whole 20 cents on each had they scrabbled around
stalls in other districts. But that would have entailed transport
costs.

Inferior stuff: The slightly discoloured tomatoes are part of a
pack of five bought by Ng for $4. Had the men wanted pork,
unavailable in the tiny amounts suitable to their budget, it would
have cost $8-10. Fish too is expensive at their level of existence,
so for one meal it would have meant something low grade at around
$10.

Salted fish, the friends note, can cost $60-70 so it is eked out in
tiny amounts over a few weeks. Fresh vegetables are a rarity on
this particular table. But that doesn't stop them from sometimes
splashing out $2 or $3 for some stale greens.

Ng can cook - which makes him luckier than most of the single
elderly. He lives in public housing and has a refrigerator which
SKM Kei Oi Social Service Centre, run by volunteers, helped him
acquire. Thus he is able to economize slightly by buying "that
little bit more" and keeping it relatively fresh.

Friend Pang's world is a bedspace cubicle, where cooking is banned.
Unless invited for tea or a larger meal by Ng, he has to shop for
his own food. A lunch box of plain white rice with a string of
green vegetable - and perhaps two pieces of meat - sets him back
$18-20. A plain soup noodle with two wonton dumplings costs about
the same.

Thus he buys $2 buns for breakfast, sometimes plain congee for $4.
If he wants fried flour sticks (yau char kui) to go with his
congee, it costs an additional $4. Pang says in order to stretch
his finances he has only two meals a day.

What about fruits? Ng and Pang reply with one voice: "Too
expensive." But they say they try to buy a few grapes or oranges
"once in a while." What then about yum cha, for which Hong Kong is
famed? "I can't remember when I last had it," says Pang, without
rancour. "It's been so long."

So can elderly people reasonably be expected to survive on $23-
worth of food a day (and disregarding that Hong Kong is one of the
richest but most expensive cities in the world)? A government
report on the Review of the Comprehensive Social Security
Assistance Scheme says they can. (The scheme was set up to help
those in financial need.)

According to Dr M. F. Leong, president of the Association of
Gerontology, people must - in order to maintain a healthy body -
have at least two main meals a day, comprising cereals or rice,
bread, meat or meat-related products, vegetables and fruits.

The government report's arithmetic is that a single elderly person
can survive on $688-worth of food a month - hence the average $23 a
day, or $7.60 a meal.

Survival: Professor Stewart MacPherson of City University agrees
with the report's findings, but only to a point. "An elderly person
can survive on $23-worth of meals per day," he says. "That is clear
from the many thousands who do so every day in Hong Kong. But can
they live? My calculation of the 'minimum acceptable' level of food
gives a figure of $34 per day for an elderly person at today's
prices. This is still not generous, and is a minimum standard."

He explains: "The major difference between SWD calculations and
mine is that they exclude all food except that required for
survival. I try to take some account of real life to allow some
dignity in social life for old people."

Suvan Law of the voluntary social service centre is "appalled" at
the SWD allocation. "I don't know what [the government] was
thinking. Imagine having only $7.60 to spend on a meal. This may be
one of the reasons why old people have no money to buy healthy
foods." She has on earlier occasions accused the government of
ignorance in its calculation of people's basic needs. "Government
officers really don't know how the elderly live, what they eat or
how they try to save by buying low-quality food," she charges.

In scrimping, many of the elderly forego social events such as
picnics or trips to other districts. "That is why so many of them
are found in parks - their only social life," says Law.

Dr S. Y. Au, president of the Hong Kong Geriatric Society, relates
how his elderly patients save money. "I received some tips from
them, like don't boil water," he says. "Just drink tap water to
save energy. When cooking, prepare enough for two meals so that,
again, fuel is saved. Afterwards, don't put leftover food in the
fridge as more energy is required to warm it up."

While the inventiveness of the elderly in cutting financial corners
is admirable, it should not detract from the harsh fact that a
proper diet is as important to them as a babe in arms. As Au says:
"These people are more prone to disease, and so have to pay
particular attention to their diet."

But, given the amounts they are presently expected to manage on,
can they do so, ask social workers? The CSSA payment for a single
elderly person was increased last April to $1,935 per month from
$1,810 - a jump of seven per cent, said by the government to be
pegged to inflation.

"But things today are so much more expensive, especially for the
elderly," argues Law. In addition to higher quality food, they by
far prefer Chinese herbal medicines which can cost anywhere between
$100-150. And while public hospital services are virtually free for
CSSA recipients, the queues are long.

Au says that, sometimes, the problems of the elderly might not so
much be lack of money as lack of knowledge about the availability
of resources. "The problem is that many may not know what these
resources are, and how to access them. We therefore need to
increase publicity," he suggests.

There is another side to receiving welfare, he says. Many of the
elderly can be quite proud when it comes to seeking financial aid
from the government. One example is a 76-year-old woman who buys a
single fish for $5, making it last for two days. She consistently
refuses help, says Au. "She says she has no financial problems, and
says she is used to eating half a fish a day - which she regards as
a good habit." Even an offer of help over a new set of dentures
(minimum cost $800) was refused. "She said she had enough money to
buy her own," says Dr Au.

Law agrees that many of the elderly refuse to live on what they
perceive as charity. Sometime, she admits, social workers have to
convince them that it is their right to ask for financial help from
the government. "It's often a tug-of-war between charity and their
rights. We have to convince them that it is their right to have a
better life after all their years of contributing to society- their
right to live with quality and dignity."

Current SWD payments being what they are, she adds, "dignity"
appears to be a foreign word.

Perhaps, she says, the government should heed MacPherson when he
says that the so-called Basic Needs Approach adopted by the SWD is
"inappropriate in a wealthy modern society such as Hong Kong," and
that it should re-think just how much an elderly person can live on
with dignity.

Says MacPherson: "We should be using standards and measures which
reflect the society we live in. A society may be judged by the way
it treats its old people."

HONGKONG: POLITICS: Li Enters CE Race: Heavyweight contenders ready for
battle 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BRIAN MACLEOD, P.8

WITH the announcement on Wednesday by retired Appeal Court judge
Simon Li Fook-sean - a 10-year behind-the-scenes veteran of key
transition events and positions - that he has officially joined the
race for the chief executive post, and a similar confirmation by
shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa last weekend, the contest has begun
to take on some really interesting dimensions. In joining Chief
Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang and businessman Peter K.C. Woo, it can be
said that there are now true heavyweights in the ring, giving the
lie to those who proclaim that the selection process would amount
to little more than Beijing bestowing its blessing on the pre-
ordained candidate of its choice.

Although Li has been the last of the four to declare his candidacy,
his decisiveness in doing so stands in marked contrast to the coy
initial approaches made by other aspirants - a decisiveness that no
doubt comes naturally to a former Appeals Court judge.

Firm stand: And decisiveness is not the only quality that sets
candidate Li apart. While all the contestants in the race so far
claim that, as chief executive, they would consider comprehensive
consultation with the community-at-large in aid of reaching
consensus, Li has taken a firm stand in favour of governing Hong
Kong as it has always been governed: "I think that the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region's chief executive's administration
blueprint should include a comprehensive and detailed policy
programme. But this should be based on the existing tradition of
policy-making which has served Hong Kong so well," he says.

He is also candid in saying that he believes this programme cannot
be spelled out in detail at the present time, given that so many of
the variables on which it will ultimately depend will remain
unknown until after the formation of the first SAR government. But
his declaration in favour of maintaining the status quo differs
from the rather more prescriptive policy ideas being put forward by
the other candidates in laying out their vision of Hong Kong's
future.

As Li sees it, the chief executive's primary role will be to
faithfully implement the Basic Law. Otherwise, while he supports
the setting up of the Provisional Legislature simply out of legal
necessity, he would limit the scope of its activity to enacting
only the legislation needed to allow the new SAR government to
function; other legislation would wait to be dealt with in detail
after the establishment of the first elected SAR Legislative
Council.

Li also stands for preserving the apolitical role of the Civil
Service (including the disciplined services,) and ensuring that
civil servants have a solid grasp of the new concepts inherent in
the basic law as a prime expedient in maintaining Hong Kong's
promised autonomy. As well, he takes a holistic view of the way the
SAR will have to be governed, safeguarding the livelihood and
interests of the grassroots on the one hand while ensuring that
Hong Kong remains the investment destination of choice for both
local and international investors. And, not surprisingly, as a
former judge, he is a strong advocate of upholding the rule of law
in the territory.

Tung Chee-hwa, in his long-awaited policy testimonial, wants to
build the new Hong Kong's relationship with the mainland in a
spirit of seeking consensus built on mutual trust: "To stand up for
the interests of Hong Kong does not mean confrontation," he says.
He also laid emphasis on the need to ". . . talk more about our
duties, rather than our rights."

Key role: In his view, the SAR has a key role to play in the
modernization of China, helping it to take its natural place as an
international leader. At the strictly political level, he hopes to
elicit support in achieving the necessary consensus from all
political parties, including the Democrats. More broadly, he feels
that paying closer attention to traditional Chinese cultural values
could go a long way to ensuring a much more harmonious transition,
and they remain, according to Tung, ". . . as relevant today as
they have ever been."

What is more interesting is that the race, in the end, will be
likely to boil down to a choice between a candidate from either the
business or legal communities. And in choosing, Hong Kong will have
taken that all important first step in its journey of a thousand
li.

In predominantly business-oriented Hong Kong, it might seem obvious
that a businessman would be ideal, if only to ensure that one of
Hong Kong's major assets - its profitability - is preserved. But
the very things that make a businessman successful - an intense,
and perhaps somewhat narrow concentration on the bottom line -
could amount to disadvantages in executing what will certainly be
an arduous and many-dimensioned task in heading up the first SAR
government.

A legal person, on the other hand, particularly one who has devoted
a lifetime to serving society on the bench, has of necessity take a
broader view of the complex interactions of society, and through
this is likely to have a more cogent view of the interests of the
various sectors that make it up, both in a local and international
context.

This basic, fundamental choice is what will now make the contest of
compelling interest, both inside and outside Hong Kong.

HONGKONG: CRIME: A Haven for Horrors: Killers lurk among Lantau's hordes
of visitors 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By TOM IGGULDEN, P.6-7

LANTAU is becoming a haven for murderers and kidnappers, police on
the island say. With just one recorded murder last year, six bodies
have been discovered so far this year, according to the Lantau
North Assistant District Commander for crime, Liam Scally.

The island draws thousands of visitors every weekend, attracted by
cheap holiday villas and remote countryside. But the features that
lure the leisurely also make Lantau ideal for those who would avoid
the prying eyes of the cramped city.

Scally says the New Territories used to be the place of choice for
kidnappers to hold their hostages, and for murderers to dump their
victims' remains. But as development encroaches on Yuen Long,
Fanling and other traditional hide-out grounds, criminals are on
the lookout for less conspicuous places to pursue their activities.

Stranger: "With so many visitors coming here anyway, no one is
going to notice a stranger who stays for a weekend or a week," says
Scally. The island's steep hills, remote beaches and out-of-the-way
roads also make ideal terrain for body-dumping.

The body of Chan Lan-kiu, a 34-year-old insurance agent, was the
first to be discovered on the island this year. Her dismembered
corpse was found in about 10 pieces on February 16, more than a
week after it was dumped on a hillside at Ngong Ping.

It may never have been found if one of her alleged killers, Lo Yau-
fuk, 28, had not led police to the site in mid-February, 10 days
after Chan went missing. Chan's meticulous diary allegedly detailed
a scheduled meeting with Lo the day she disappeared.

He was detained at the Lo Wu border crossing attempting to leave
the territory.

Lo and Cheung Moon-keung, 29, are said to have shot Chan, loaded
her body into a van and driven to Shum Wat Road late at night to
dispose of the remains. They are alleged to have held her hostage
in a Mui Wo holiday villa, demanding a $300,000 ransom from her
family. Their trial is scheduled for January.

They have also been charged with two other murders on the island.
Police say they were led to two more bodies, those of Yung Tse-lun
and Chan Chik-yee, bound in cloth and buried under bushes in
shallow graves on a remote hillside at Lai Chi.

Though the area is sparsely populated, the bodies were found about
100m from the doorstep of resident Keith Addison, who has since
moved to Mui Wo.

"Certainly I would never have found them, even though they were so
close," he says. "They were buried and the area is very thick with
vegetation. It was scary to think that someone had come up and
buried these bodies 100 yards from my front door."

In early August, the body of a construction site foreman was found
in an abandoned hut near Tong Fuk pier. He was dressed only in
underpants, his throat had been slashed and he was covered in a
sheet of iron, his clothes beside the body.

Tong Fuk is a popular beach village with several holiday villas.
Police are still working on the case.

Later that month the body of Tam Ngan-hung washed up at Shap Long
Kau Tsuen, also on the popular southern Lantau beach strip. Tam's
naked body had been folded into a nylon bag, and red nylon string
had been tied around her head.

Kowloon West police are still investigating her killing. They
believe her body had been dumped into the sea at another beach on
Lantau.

The sixth killing on the island came to light early last month. Two
mainland workers had apparently fought over money - one battered
the other to death with a spade and later put the body in a plastic
bag and threw it into the sea. It floated for weeks until washing
up at Tung Chung New Town. The surviving mainlander later pleaded
guilty to the murder.

Worried: Addison says island-dwellers are worried about the sudden
surge in violence on Lantau. "They are concerned that among all
these visitors there are murderers and kidnappers. I think most
people think that as long as you leave them alone, they'll leave
you alone, but that doesn't mean they like it."

Andy Tsang, Senior Superintendent for Crime for New Territories
North, who is leading the investigation into the triple killing,
agrees Lantau is now more attractive to criminals than the New
Territories.

"People in the villages here aren't used to seeing a stranger, so
if they do they are more likely to remember it," he says. "I
wouldn't say we have seen a decline in murder in NT North, but I
would imagine it would take a lot longer to discover a body if it
were dumped on Lantau."

However, he says there is insufficient evidence yet to establish
whether a change is in progress. "The sample [six bodies in a year]
is too small too make a trend out of," he adds.

Scally says the island's holiday villas are also used by triad
debt-collectors to hide kidnap victims. "Let's say you run up a
gambling debt in Macau, then you return to Hong Kong rather than
pay it. The loansharks in Macau will sell the debt to their
contacts in Hong Kong, who are a lot more ruthless about collecting
it."

This usually means kidnapping either the debtor or a member of the
family for ransom. Scally says Lantau is increasingly playing host
to these kidnappings.

Tsang says the island is not necessarily the perfect place for
hiding a hostage or dumping a body. The ferry is the only access to
Lantau unless you have your own boat. Tsang says that if police are
able to follow a kidnapping trail to Lantau, finding the hostage
and the kidnapper is easier on the island than in the city. If a
criminal knows police are closing in, a quick getaway from the
island is almost impossible.

Tsang says murderers or kidnappers must also first lure their
victims to the island. A Lantau murder, he says, must be properly
planned and the murderer must have established some sort of
relationship with the victim before setting off for the island.

Extra police: Scally says stationing extra police on the island
would do little to contain the murder rate. All but one of the
killings this year were investigated by non-Lantau police divisions
because the victims were not residents. With throngs of visitors
every weekend, extra police at the Mui Wo ferry pier could do
little to identify "suspicious" characters.

Meanwhile Addison says the sudden jump in murders is a blow mainly
to the island's permanent residents. Addison, a long-time Lantau
resident, says he has always appreciated the island's slow pace of
change, even with the construction of the new airport at Chek Lap
Kok. "I do worry about things like this, though. I think it worries
everyone here."

SPORTS: Rafter Smashes And Grabs Title 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.5

Australia's Patrick Rafter stole the hearts of tennis teenyboppers
and netted US$200,000 as he powered his way to victory in the rain-
delayed final of the Marlboro Championships at Victoria Park on
Monday.

The 23-year-old Queenslander overcame American Vincent Spadea 6-2,
3-6, 6-2, 7-5 to take his first singles title since 1994. Rafter, a
former top 20 player now ranked 56th after an injury-plagued year,
was a clear crowd favourite. Scores of young female fans whoopped
at every point he won, and were "rewarded" by the sweat-soaked T-
shirt he threw into the crowd after clinching victory. Rafter
admitted the fans had given him a boost. "It's the kind of
attention I like. I'd be lying if I said I didn't." His
concentration was also tested by the prospects of a fat pay cheque,
the largest in his career so far. "I was thinking about the sum of
money [during the match] I have to admit. It's hard when you've got
that in your mind and it does make it difficult to play."

Rafter's blistering serves, clever drop volleys and accurate
smashes kept 22-year-old Spadea on the defensive. Ranked 65th in
the world, Spadea pocketed $65,000 for his gritty but, at times,
petulent performance. The American was a lucky entry into the semi-
finals, replacing injured fourth-seed and compatriot Richey
Reneberg to beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman.

The championships proved one of the most dramatic in its nine-year
history. Despite one of the strongest line-ups ever, none of the
top four seeds made it into the semi-finals. Lacklustre
performances saw the early exits of world No.1 Pete Sampras of the
US, No.3 Thomas Muster of Austria, and French Open champion and
No.4 Yevgenev Kafelnikov of Russia.

Sampras seemed as stunned as the capacity 4,000 crowd when he bowed
out to world 47th Byron Black of Zimbabwe in straight sets, 6-4, 6-
2. He later reflected: "I just couldn't get my game going. I was
digging a hole deeper and deeper with a lot of unforced errors."
But he denied that as it was a non-official ATP tournament, his
heart hadn't been in the match. "I play to win, I don't want to
lose to anyone. It hurts just as much as, say, losing the US Open."
Black, whose masterful return of serves constantly outwitted the
number one seed, failed to find the same form when he met Rafter in
the next round. The champion won 6-2, 5-7, 6-3.

Unseasonal heavy rains postponed the final by a day, allowing 2,500
fans to watch for free. The unseeded finalists proved the silver
lining in the dark clouds as higher-ranked players would have been
unlikely to play beyond Sunday due to other commitments.

CHINA DIARY: Making arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March:
Long March Commemorated 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By DAVID CHEN, P.4

CHINA celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Long March this week
with President Jiang Zemin calling on the nation to carry forward
the revolutionary spirit of the epic event and push forward the
great undertakings initiated by old revolutionaries.

The event was marked by a soiree and a commemoration ceremony on
Monday and Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People, reported
Xinhua.

Sixty years ago, the Red Army, forerunner of the People's
Liberation Army, covered 12,500km, trekking through more than a
dozen provinces and municipalities, defeating numerous attacks by
Kuomintang forces and became strong through their historic feat.

It was in the critical Long March period that the Chinese Communist
Party held the Zunyi meeting, during which Mao Zedong was made the
leader of the Red Army and the party Central Committee, signalling
that the party had become mature, President Jiang told the
gathering at the commemoration ceremony.

He described the Long March as "a brilliant chapter in Chinese
history and the military history of the world."

The president, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party
and chairman of the Central Military Commission, urged party cadres
to follow the examples of the revolutionaries and learn to make
sacrifices, but not to seek comfort.

"It is completely wrong to think that now that we are materially
better off, we no longer need to strive hard and struggle," Jiang
added.

Spiritual force: "The spirit of the Long March," he said, "is a
strong spiritual force that guarantees our marching from victory to
victory."

Looking forward to the next century, President Jiang said the party
had created Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and established the basic line and a
series of principles and policies, as well as a development
strategy in three phases, and a cross-century blueprint.

"The crux of the matter for the moment," Jiang said, "is to fully
implement those lines, principles and policies and make enormous
and arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March."

It has been a busy week for President Jiang on the diplomatic
front, greeting heads of state and senior foreign government
officials as well as prominent businessmen.

The most notable meeting he has had was with the German Foreign
Minister, Klaus Kinkel, whose planned visit scheduled for early
this year was postponed because of the adoption of a resolution by
the German parliament on the Tibet issue. China regarded the
parliamentary action as interference with the country's internal
affairs. Discussions and exchanges during the intervening months
have resolved the controversy and Kinkel's visit signified the
return of the very warm relationship between the two countries. Not
only did Kinkel have a series of intensive and fruitful sessions
with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, but the visitor was also
received by President Jiang and Premier Li Peng.

Noting the resumption of the friendly ties, President Jiang
observed: "As long as the two sides earnestly abide by the
principles of mutual respect, seeking a common ground while putting
aside differences, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs and equality and mutual benefits , there will be good
prospects for relations between the two countries."

He welcomed the minister to China, noting that Kinkel's main task
was to make preparations for the German president's visit.
"President Roman Herzog's visit is an important event in bilateral
relations," Jiang said, adding that he was looking forward to
meeting with him.

Premier Li said that Sino-German relations should be oriented to
the future, recent twists and difficulties in these ties having
coming to an end.

Economic and trade cooperation between the two countries had
achieved marked results and bilateral cooperation in various fields
had brought about benefits for both sides, he added.

Li also met German businessmen in Kinkel's entourage, noting that
Germany's business circle had made positive contributions to the
healthy development of bilateral ties.

President Jiang also met the chairman of the Russian Federation
Council, Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, expressing the belief that the
latter's visit would become a milestone in exchanges between the
parliaments of the two countries.

THE 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Auto Rally got off to a rousing start on
Saturday from Stonecutters Island, in Hong Kong, on what will be
the last race under the present format. Next year, the 3,800-
kilometre race will be shortened to three days, centering on
Beijing and following a world championship format. The defending
champion Kenneth Eriksson from Sweden was soon in trouble when his
Subaru crashed on stage 12, the longest in the event.

His closest competitor in the 52-car race is Ari Vatanen. If either
of them win, they will be the first drivers to take the event
twice. The rally, which was inaugurated in 1985 and held seven
times, will conclude today in Beijing. Only 27 of the 52 starters

March last year.

Tin pleaded guilty to trying to persuade a witness not to give

"The greatest significance of the victory of the Long March was the
establishment of Comrade Mao Zedong's leading position in the Red
Army and the Party Central Committee and the formation of the first
collective leadership, with Comrade Mao as the core."
- Chinese President Jiang Zemin marking the 60th anniversary of the
march.

INSURING PRIVATE MEDICAL EXPENSES

The UK Market

Strong encouragement by government for people to make their own welfare
provision means that private medical expenses cover continues to be an
attractive employee benefit.  Individuals who are not insured by their
employer have the option of buying private plans.  In response, some
insurers have introduced a range of low cost schemes to accommodate
businesses and individuals unable to finance more comprehensive cover.

Despite energetic marketing by provident associations and insurers as
well as increasing criticism directed at the National Heath Service
(NHS), the market for private medical insurance has not grown for many
years.  Peter Mannion, assistant actuary, Munich Re, told a recent
conference in London that only 11% of the UK population was insured,
with market share being gained by new entrants largely at the expense
of the leading providents.

He identified flaws in private medical cover and suggested some
solutions.

* With products varying considerably in coverage, it might be helpful
if each type of product had guaranteed minimum cover.  There would
still be scope for competition in coverage above the minimum and in
other areas such as service and premiums.

* Insurers often adjust cover at renewal, sometimes limiting it or
introducing lower monetary limits.  This can be confusing for
policyholders and other routes might be tried to protect the
underwriting result.

* Private medical cover is not really designed to cover chronic
conditions, particularly those resulting from ageing and most insurers
turn off such claims when treatment becomes of a palliative nature.  Mr
Mannion suggested insurers consider whether cover could be extended or
whether a cash benefit could be offered in such circumstances.

* Medical insurance has a reputation for rapidly rising premiums; as
well as inflation in medical costs, policyholders have to cope with
heavy premium hikes when they move into a new five year age band,
meaning that cover may become unaffordable as people age.  One solution
might be designing long term contracts with level premiums (other than
inflation increases) throughout, as offered by the Exeter Friendly
Society.  There is also scope for life insurers to enter the market via
this route.

Private medical expenses cover is a significant part of the UK
healthcare market which includes other products such as income
replacement benefit, critical illness cover, long term care insurance
and major medical expenses.  Income replacement benefit sales have
fallen in the last five years despite reductions in state disability
welfare benefits last year.  The other three - critical illness cover,
long term care insurance and major medical expenses - have so far
failed to make significant inroads in the market.

Major medical expenses insurance was introduced in 1992 as an
alternative to private medical expenses cover.  A number of insurers
offer this including Canada Life, GAN Life, Lincoln National, Old
Mutual and Scottish Mutual.  Generally cover is marketed in combination
with life assurance and some other benefits such as income protection.

Future prospects

The private medical expenses insurance customer base should expand
during the remainder of the 1990s, according to Laing's Review of
Private Healthcare 1995.  However, the rate of growth will depend on a
number of factors including: price of cover; the impact of new
distribution channels for individual paid cover; product innovation;
government policy, and public perception of the NHS.

The review also looks at whether commercial insurers are poised to take
a substantially larger share of the market during the 1990s.  It says
that in the early 1990s, the company sector - traditionally dominated
by the providents - became more ready to switch insurers.  By 1992,
commercial insurers' share of the company paid market reached 22.2%
although, with the exit of ITT London & Edinburgh, the share dropped
back to 19.1% in January-June 1994 (the last period for which figures
are available) as ITT London & Edinburgh's book of business transferred
to other insurers including the providents.  "The effect of this exit
has now worked its way through the system and it is likely, though
complete figures are not yet available, that the commercials' share of
company paid PMI business has started to grow again".

Commercial insurers' penetration of the individual paid market,
including small groups, initially grew more slowly with switching
between insurers being discouraged by pre-existing conditions
exclusions used by most insurers as a means of avoiding anti-selection.
 Laing's puts the commercials' share of such subscription income as
18.8% by June 1994 but suggests it has probably increased further since
with the continuing growth of Norwich Union's individual business.

Scope for further fragmentation of the market depends on barriers to
entry and economies of scale.  Industry sources suggest that a
subscription income of #50m to #100m per annum may be necessary to take
full advantage of the fixed costs of setting up a comprehensive in-
house claims administration system.   "Ultimately, the key to whether
commercial insurers will sustain and consolidate their position in the
individual and corporate markets will depend on whether they can keep
their administrative overheads and new business acquisition costs low
enough to remain competitive in the long term."

EUROPEAN TRENDS

In this report - European healthcare trends: towards manged care in
Europe - Coopers & Lybrand describes and analyses health reforms in
17 countries.

There are wide variations between European healthcare systems but there
are many shared perspectives and themes in their reform programmes,
because they are responses to common pressures and the possibilities
offered by modern management and information systems.  However, the
report does not imply that a single model of health reform has emerged;
each country has responded to features of its own health system.

The starting point for most healthcare reforms has been concern to
control escalating costs.  Other objectives, such as to improve the
state of public health, to ensure equitable access to health services,
to improve the quality of health services and to make health services
more responsive to public preferences, have been major determinants.

While central measures to control cost have had an important impact,
the main aim of health reforms has been to change the way decisions are
made about the direction and management of health services.  The aim is
to create a self-regulating system, which reflects an appropriate
balance between the desired level and quality of service and affordable
resources.

The report states that the impacts of European health reforms can be
seen at four levels in decision making

* health objectives, policy and responsibilities are more clearly
defined

* health purchasing (insurance) decisions are separated from heath
provision and in some cases general practitioners are involved in
purchasing

* the management of health service provision integrates the management
of medical practice and the management of resources, in response to
patient needs

* the management of patient treatment and care is based upon evidence
of best practice regardless of setting

The merging themes in healthcare management can be seen as trends
towards a European form of managed care which supports: national health
targets; community health gain; disease management, and patient focused
care.

Some of these reflect trends in the US but they are being given new
meanings because European healthcare systems have social welfare
objectives and reflect a concern with community as well as individual
health.

Conclusions

Following detailed discussion and analysis, the report concludes that
the experience of European healthcare systems during the 1980s revealed
the limitations of a reform strategy that concentrated almost
exclusively on macroeconomic measures for cost containment.  Management
of European healthcare in the 1990s has changed its primary focus to
structural reform to ensure cost reduction (or cost inflation
containment) without compromising basic healthcare quality and access.

Successful healthcare management needs to reconcile the interests of
individuals with long-term health gain objectives of a community.  The
key to achieving this is to develop service strategies which are
monitored on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they are continuously
improved to meet national and community targets for health.  European
approaches to managed care achieve this by a balance of competitive
choice and controls and incentives.

The report says that implementation of competitive choice requires well-
informed individuals and agencies capable of assessing cost benefit
choices for the community.  Both individuals and agencies must have the
ability to influence the performance of healthcare providers.
Competing choices must be exercised within a framework of controls and
incentives which ensure that minimum standards are met and improvements
are recognised and rewarded.

In many social insurance based systems, the sickness funds are facing a
change from being regional administrative organisations (payers) to
commissioners (strategic buyers) or risk-sharing enterprises that
operate nationally.  Both tax based and social insurance systems are
recognising the importance of primary care physicians as gatekeepers to
secondary and community care.

Provision of secondary healthcare in European countries, with or
without internal markets, is increasingly being based on contracting
mechanisms and performance oriented payment using case-mix groupings
and quality specifications.  Reforms aiming at more effective hospital
management in many European countries involve clinical participation in
management, including devolution of budgetary management accountability
to clinical level.  In primary care, physicians are developing new
skills as gatekeepers and fundholders, resulting in a substantial
change of emphasis from secondary to primary care.

Equity is an issue because an increasing gap between resources and
demand is forcing priority setting and rationing which has to be
justified by reference to social values.  Since all European healthcare
systems must be seen as elements of social welfare, equity is an
important issue in all countries.  Health reforms with or without
purchaser-provider separation make rationing more explicit so it is
therefore essential that the basis for rationing should be accepted as
fair.

The report also concludes that purchasing of healthcare services is
increasingly being based on knowledge derived from epidemiological
needs assessment and measures of outcomes research and quality
assurance programmes.  On the provider side, effective disease
management strategies are increasingly based on medical treatment
guidelines.  Knowledge based purchasing and provision of healthcare in
the 1990s will be heavily dependent on information systems.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETING

AtIBC's Healthcare Industry Conference last November, Neil Horseman,
market manager, BUPA International, looked at the feasibility of
internationally marketing products.

Referring to international concern about current trends in state
healthcare provisions, Mr Horseman discussed whether or not
international marketing of healthcare insurance products was a
realistic goal.  "From small, mature markets like Spain and the
Netherlands, to the vast populations of China and Brazil, people
throughout the world are taking a very serious look at the potential
for private healthcare.  The market has already grown substantially in
recent years, and is set for further continued expansion well into the
next century."

However, while international marketing can be achieved, there are a
number of important considerations.  Markets must be considered
individually as they vary enormously.  "Even countries that seem very
similar in many respects can represent very different marketing
propositions - perhaps due to a minor difference in legislation."

* The impact of local legislation must be taken into account.  In the
United States, for example, legislation makes it virtually impossible
for a non-US company to break into the market.  In other countries, the
regime is slightly more relaxed in theory, but made impenetrable in
practice by a maze of rules and regulations, with the European
Community being a typical example.  Products need to be tailored to
suit local requirements.

* Access is an issue with problems arising from time differences,
different languages, different cultures and different business
environments.  The change in political climates around the world is
helping to ease problems to a  certain extent.  In developed countries,
in particular, the trend towards de-regulation is opening up many new
opportunities.

* Cultural complexity is a major issue in itself.  Differing cultural
values can affect not only marketing but even the validity of the
product as, for example, in Saudi Arabia where the concept of insurance
is somewhat alien to the local culture and could be interpreted as
interfering with destiny.  In Vietnam, most people do not use the state
health service, preferring self-medication or traditional healers.  "If
people don't take advantage of the free state health service, they are
unlikely to be inclined to pay for private treatment."

Mr Horseman stressed that essentially private medical expenses insurers
are selling peace of mind, rather than a tangible product, so buying
cover is as much an emotional decision as a practical one.  Any market
proposition must take account of the fact that people's emotional view
of life is coloured considerably by cultural factors such as religion
and lifestyle.

In a competitive market, there will also be competition from local
healthcare insurers so new entrants must invest in building a brand
image in which people can have total confidence.  "That means having
the people, resources and capability to deal with customers' problems
quickly and efficiently.  It means having the right structure in place,
from distribution through to service delivery."  Customer service is a
key issue, as is cost.

Mr Horseman emphasised the importance of research, product definition
and service, distribution and marketing strategies.  He concluded that
international marketing is a realistic goal - but only for those
prepared to make the effort to get things right.

INDUSTRIAL FIRE PREMIUM DOWN

German industrial fire insurers expect premium income in 1996 to drop
sharply due to price reductions leading to even higher underwriting
losses than those expected for 1995, Klaus Nowitzky, chief executive of
Jaspers Industrie Assekuranz GmbH & Co KG (JIA), Frankfurt, told a
press conference in Dusseldorf recently.  Industrial insurers were
"displaying their irrationality", he said.  "The same insurers who
recently still praised the Konsortialkommissionen (Kokos) are now
heating up competition by substantially undercutting existing premium
levels."

Peak risks in particular had gone down in price, he said.  "Good peak
risks are now quoted 25% below their former price; on average all peak
risks pay 20% less," Mr Nowitzky claimed.  In some instances rate cuts
of 40% had been granted, Ottokar Engelhardt, another JIA executive,
added.  The market for smaller risks was also softening rapidly.
Overall, income in industrial fire in 1996 will be down by more than
DM300m on the estimated DM4.2bn for 1995, the JIA executives said.
"We wonder whether the industrial insurance market went out of control
by accident, or whether it was a conscious decision to force some
insurers out of the market," Mr Nowitzky said, commenting in Allianz'
decision to leave the German fire tariff.  Manufacturing industry was
happy to receive premium reductions but was worried that small and
medium-sized insurers would leave the market eventually.  "We would be
left with an oligopoly, and this is certainly not in the interests of
industrial insurance customers," Mr Nowitzky said.  He added that the
irrationality of the situation was underlined by examples of companies
imposing premium increases for 1995, "always with the justification
that higher prices were urgently needed because of the risk situation",
a position new undermined in fresh price talks for 1996.  There was
even talk of reinsurers planning a new round of market rehabilitation
measures for 1 January 1997, keeping the industry on a roller coaster
ride.

GUJARAT CONTINUES CROP COVER

The Gujarat government has continued the Comprehensive Crop Insurance
Scheme (CCIS) for the rabi (winter) 1995-96 season in the state subject
to certain conditions.  The scheme covers crops of wheat (irrigated and
unirrigated), gram, rape seed and mustard, summer groundnut and summer
barja (coarse grain).  The indemnity limits are 80% for wheat
(irrigated), rape seed and mustard, summer groundnut and summer barja
and 60% for gram and wheat (unirrigated).  Insurance is limited to
Rs10,000 per farmer, irrespective of the loan taken, while the total
insured sum is 100% of the crop loan.  Under the scheme, 107 talukas
have been notified as "defined area" for wheat (irrigated), 37 for
summer groundnut, 30 talukas each for rape seed and mustard and summer
barja, 25 for gram and 20 talukas for wheat (unirrigated).

EMSS RESEARCH BEGINS

The Loss Prevention Council (LPC) is collaborating with Imperial
College London to investigate the links between Environmental
Management Systems (EMSs) and insurance.  EMSs are new tools by which
insurers may be able to assess and quantify the environmental
performance of their clients.  The LPC says that governments and
international agencies agree that continued, sustainable economic
development depends on the availability of adequate insurance cover for
environmental risks.  However, insurers are said to be wary of such
risks, particularly because of past experiences in the United States.

A three-year study entitled The Response of the Insurance Industry to
Developments in Environmental Management Systems recently began at the
Centre for Environmental Technology at Imperial College London.  The
research is aimed at analysing the response of insurers to the
introduction of EMSs as expressed in their attitudes towards their
clients' environmental performance, as well as supplying insurers with
information gathered during the study on the usefulness and benefits of
EMSs.

The study will also address the following questions.  What are the main
constraints on the environmental insurance market?  Are these caused by
uncertainties in technical assessment, or other problems such as long-
term uncertainty in legal liability?  How do insurers currently assess
the environmental performance of their clients - if at all?

In the medium term, the study aims to determine whether and to what
extent compliance with EMSs standards supports insurers' own assessment
systems, and also whether and how insurers might effectively use EMSs
in their assessments.

Melrose Avenue, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire WD6 2BJ, UK.  Telephone 0181

GANGSTAR DEALERS CARRY RISK

Unlike other motor manufacturers, Beijing Jeep is not providing
indemnity assurances to dealers but states in its dealer agreement that
in liability issues the dealer will be expected to "defend and
indemnify" the distributor.  Beijing Jeep which makes GangStar is owned
by the Chinese government.  When the Yugoslavia-built Yugo entered the
US market in the mid-1980s, its distributor agreed to stand behind the
product to defend its dealers.

TERMINATION OF MOTOR POLICIES

The German supervisory authority Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das
Versicherungswesen (BAV), Berlin, is attempting to change the date by
which a motor policyholder can terminate a policy.  This is a matter of
some concern for insurers, because of the growing movement of insureds
between underwriters.  So far the BAV has shared the view of the
industry that for "old" contracts ie those signed before July 1994
(when liberalised laws came into effect) a three-month notice period
was required.  As most German motor policies begin on 1 January, this
would have meant that the majority of German motorists could not have
switched insurers in January 1996 unless they had decided to terminate
their policy before 1 October 1995 - when the current price war had
just started.

Only for "new" policies signed under the new law was a one-month period
legally binding, ran the old interpretation.  But in mid-November,
shortly before the final date for the one-month notice, BAV suddenly
changed its mind and said that "after scrutinising the legal situation
again" it had come to the conclusion that all policyholders, old and
new, could cancel with just one month's notice.  This, at least, is the
view with regard to TPL contracts; it remains unclear whether
comprehensive policies are also included in this interpretation.

Many insurers, including leading provider of low price motor cover HUK-
Coburg (Haftpflicht-Unterstutzungs-Kasse Kraftfahrender Beamter
Deutschlands aG), have already voluntarily offered the possibility of
termination after one month to their customers.  But HUK-Coburg chief
executive Rolf-Peter Hoenen is also head of the motor committee in the
property and casualty insurers' federation Verband der Sachversicherer
(VdS), Bonn, and in this role he is critical of BAV's changed view,
because it has confused the situation.  He believes that the courts
will have to settle the argument.

NEW PREMIUMS INTRODUCED

A German insurer has introduced new premiums for all cars to take
effect from the beginning of this month.  Apart from slight premium
reductions and an expansion of the emergency telephone service, no
special discounts have been offered.

PREMIUMS RISE

Insurers were expected to submit their new motor tariffs, to take
effect from 1 January, to the Ministry of Commerce.  According to the
minister, Nikos Akritidis, the average increases will be determined by
the large public and private insurers.  However, despite the minister's
guarded optimism that the average increase would be 20%, the real
figure is expected to be around 30%.  Large private insurers are
expected to set an even higher rise in premiums.

The increases will not be uniform for the whole of the country.  For
example, the largest public insurer, National Insurance (Ethniki
Asfalistiki), will adopt different tariffs for the Attica prefecture
(+29%) than for the other regions (+19%).  Other insurers were also
reported to be planning greater increases in the large urban areas,
smaller ones in the country and even smaller ones in the border
regions.

The increases relate exclusively to the compulsory civil liability
element of cover.  However, the premium hikes are expected to lead to a
drop of up to 50% in complementary covers such as fire and theft which
most motorists bought before.

RATES WARNING

A specialist UK motor insurer warns that changes in reinsurance rates
and the need for bigger reserves will inevitably put pressure on rates.
 Recent legal developments have introduced the use of actuarial
evidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of a discount rate
linked to the yield of index linked government securities.  These
combined factors will have an enormous impact upon the claims burden
falling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says the insurer.

Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and the
Civil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogden
multipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all future
cases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claim
for an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,
Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.

It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a general
increase in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.
Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currently
pleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.
This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns the insurer, as
otherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.

The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase in
insurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in many
reinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in the
future.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue year
will see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior year
claims.
Significant effects are already being shown on quotations for
reinsurance for 1996.  The insurer concludes that these increases,
coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almost
certainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry early
this year.

House, Brigstock Road, Thornton Heath, Surrey CR7 7JA, UK.  Telephone

WORST EUROPEAN RECORD FOR CAR CRIME

British motorists are at much greater risk of having their cars stolen
than drivers in the rest of Europe, according to the second annual
European Car Crime study by a UK insurer.  The study, compiled from the
latest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, compared
the number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total number
of cars in use.

The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22
cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly double
the level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars per
thousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowest
in Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.
The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three per
thousand cars went missing.

Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.
The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.
In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.

CARGO TARIFF RETURNS

The General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) has re-introduced
tariff regulations for a wide variety of commodities.  The GIC has
issued a directive to its four subsidiaries announcing new tariff rates
which, in effect, bring back regulation to marine cargo rates
deregulated in April 1994.  Since then, rate cutting has been rife in
the sector with a fall in premium rates for crude oil from about 0.8%
of cargo value to as low as 0.01%.  Rates for certain raw materials and
capital goods fell from 1.5% to 0.03%, a fall of almost 100% in both
cases.  In order to bring back stability, the GIC has re-introduced
tariffs and also introduced tariffs for commodities not tariffed before
April 1994 such as metal pipes and tubes, oil cakes and cashew nuts.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE PLANS

CapMac, leading credit "enhancer" of asset based securities, is
planning to launch financial guarantee cover in India through Asia Ltd.
 The intention reflects the fact that the increasing role of the
private sector in infrastructure has led to demand for credit rating
such projects.  Since financial guarantee insurance helps in achieving
higher rating for debt instruments, it would allow the promoter of an
infrastructure project to market infrastructure revenue bonds more
effectively than on a stand alone basis.  Potential for financial
guarantee insurance is also enhanced by the capital adequacy
requirements for financial institutions and banks, likely emergence of
a municipal bond market and initiatives taken to activate the asset-
based securities in the country.

Mahesh K Kotecha, managing director of CapMac, said that CapMac's
regional financial guarantee company, Asia Ltd, plans to underwrite
infrastructure revenue bonds and asset-based securities to the
international rating agencies' high non-investment grade standards.
The company will also refer deals it guarantees for additional credit
enhancement to triple-A rated agencies such as World Bank, Asian
Development Bank and CapMac.

Traditionally, the supply of infrastructure has been the responsibility
of the government.  However, because of the ballooning fiscal deficit,
the government has had difficulty in allocating adequate resources and
so has facilitated entry by the private sector by offering a number of
fiscal and tax incentives.

MANDATORY COVER FOR BANK DEPOSITS

The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, has passed a law introducing a
mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investors against lost
bank deposits.  Compensation will be paid from a special fund whose
authorised capital is to be financed by the state budget.  The fund's
reserve capital will come from insurance premiums, late payment fees
and fines, revenue from investments and money received from banks under
receivership procedures.  The maximum sum insured will be 5,000 litas
and investors will be able to claim 80% of the value of their deposits.

The fund will only pay out compensation for deposits held with domestic
banks in the national currency.  Foreign currency accounts and deposits
held with subsidiaries and branches of Lithuanian banks abroad will not
be covered.

their mortgages and customers who are already insured, but who would
prefer to deal through their local insurance adviser.  For the self-
employed, cover is available for accident, sickness, bankruptcy, or the
involuntary liquidation of the relevant business.  The policy offers up
to 12 months' benefit after an initial qualifying period of 60
consecutive days.

PRIVATE HEALTH CONCERNS

A member company of Allianz AG Holding is concerned at the long-term
trend in the private health market towards rising losses and weak
growth.  Chief executive Dr Jan Boetius is convinced that Health
Maintenance Organisation (HMO) models similar to those used in the US
will be necessary.  Cost control within the industry, which covers
around 10% of the German population, is a problem, not unlike the
statutory system of health funds, Dr Boetius admitted, and new methods
of providing care will have to be found.

"At present, people only think about spreading the costs, not avoiding
or controlling them.  It is our principle that cost control and cost
avoidance should come before cost distribution," Dr Boetius told WPG
sister publication, World Insurance Corporate Report.  "At the moment
we have two dual relationships, patient/doctor and patient/insurer.
The patient goes to his doctor and gets treatment, receives the bill
and sends it to us.  Only at that point can we say anything and, for
example, check whether unnecessary treatment has been carried out or
whether the charge has been properly calculated."

"We cannot break away from this mechanism, as long as we are always
behind the event.  Therefore we have to turn these two bilateral
relationships into a trilateral one.  We need to have direct contact
with the doctors and therapists," Dr Boetius said.  He could imagine,
for example, a Gatekeeper model - setting specific sums per patient for
a doctor.  From this sum he will also pay any specialists to whom he
refers the patient.  "The American models cannot be transferred to us
as they are, but we need the basic principle.  In order to really
control costs, the people who provide the services have to be closely
connected with those paying."

Concerns about increased claims were also reflected by a premium rate
increase introduced by another insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse
(AOK) of Lower Saxony, this year.  Meanwhile, PKV-Verband, Cologne, the
association of private health insurers, has set up a working group to
discuss the HMO concept.

BANK-INSURER ALLIANCE

Norway's third largest commercial bank Fokus Bank A/S has formed an
alliance with Denmark's second largest insurer for the development and
sale of savings and insurance products.  The alliance will initially
centre on life insurance, pension and other types of personal cover,
which will be marketed as Fokus products throughout the bank's
distribution network in Norway.  Fokus said the agreement formed part
of its strategy to offer customers a complete portfolio of financial
products.

For the insurer, the alliance marks its first success in gaining a
foothold in the Norwegian market.  The British-Danish group - 65%
owned by the UK's Sun Alliance - was involved in a take-over contest
for Forenede Forsikring A/S in the early 1990s and has also shown
interest in Vital Forsikring A/S, which is currently at the centre of
an ownership battle between Den norske Bank A/S and Dutch insurer Aegon
NV.

NEW SUBSIDENCE RATING SYSTEM

A specialist insurer of higher value households is pioneering a
revolutionary system, provided by the British Geological Survey (BGS),
for rating the subsidence risk of individual properties.  The
computerised system - known as the Geo Hazard Susceptibility Package 2
(GHASP 2) - is based on the BGS's 1:10,000-scale geological maps, the
most detailed information on geo hazards available across the UK.  It
enables the underwriter to pinpoint the precise bedrock beneath
individual properties, even where situated close to other properties.

The insurer says that the system represents a major advance on other
current methods of assessing subsidence risk, which are based just on
the first three or four digits of a postcode and give only the average
risk for groups of several hundred homes.  It claims that use of GHASP
2 will lead to premium savings of up to 60% for existing policyholders
with lower risk properties that are currently included within higher
risk postcodes, and even bigger reduction for policyholders moving to
the underwriter from other insurers.

The new rating system is being applied to the underwriter's 606 High
Value House and Contents Policy and will be used in particular to rate
properties in southern England, where many postcodes are susceptible
locally to a wide variety of geo hazards.

QUADRIPLEGIA AND PARAPLEGIA COVER

A Lloyd's broking and financial services group has launched what it
claims is a unique personal accident programme for schools and sports
clubs, providing 24 hour cover for pupils/members for permanent total
disablement resulting in quadriplegia or paraplegia.  This cover can
top-up an existing policy to a total limit of #1m per pupil.

Director Graham Reid said: "The risk of quadriplegia or paraplegia is
of increasing concern to authorities today, where existing policies are
totally inadequate.  This policy now offers a realistic level of
indemnity for sportsmen and women who will, in the main, have their
full life in front of them".  More than seven million people receive
hospital treatment as a result of accidents each year and it is
estimated that of these 1.8m are sports related.

OPEC Countries & Their E&P Partners Have Bright Prospects

Contrary to expectations made in the past year, the situation in
most OPEC countries has improved and their prospects in 1996 are
bright. The prospects for foreign oil companies investing in these
countries are bright as well. To the surprise of pessimists, the
situation in Saudi Arabia will be among the most stable. The
following is a review of prospects in each of the OPEC countries,
based on information obtained by highly placed APS sources:

ALGERIA

The state concern Sonatrach has signed a deal securing the largest
investment by a foreign oil company in Algeria since it won its
independence from France in 1962. Several such agreements are under
negotiation with some of the world's largest oil companies.

The deal, signed on Dec. 23, 1995 in Algiers, commits British
Petroleum to invest in a $3.5 billion programme to develop and
market huge gas reserves in the In Salah region. Exxon is among
majors negotiating a similar deal (see Gas Market Trends).

Sonatrach is producing 780,000 b/d of oil, and its quota from OPEC
is 750,000 b/d. Atlantic Richfield is investing about $1.3 billion
to expand production in south-eastern Algeria. A number of major oil
discoveries were announced by Sonatrach recently after four years of
exploration by Anadarko of the US, Agip of Italy, Repsol and Cepsa
of Spain and BHP of Australia.

The business community in Algeria and foreign investors are putting
their faith in Liamine Zeroual, the former army general who was
elected president on Nov. 16. He won a five-year term with 61% of
the vote as well as a legitimacy he lacked in his previous term,
which he had secured with military help. His Islamic opponents have
lost support, weakened by a government crackdown and by internal
disputes (see News Service of this week's APS Diplomat). Donor
states are giving Algiers new credits and the government is to
accelerate the pace of economic reforms inspired by the IMF.

Foreign oil companies operating in Algeria are satisfied with the
security measures and special flight facilities to and from the
hydrocarbon-rich south. Since mid-1995, the government has
established four exclusion zones in the south with the army
providing protection against sabotage. There are about 5,000
expatriates working in the south, mainly in the hydrocarbon sector.
Their number will increase with the advent of BP, Exxon and other
foreign operators.

GABON

Producing 370,000 b/d, against a quota of 287,000 b/d from OPEC,
Gabon still has good prospects for E&P investors and its capacity in
1996 would reach 400,000 b/d.

b/d production ceiling over to end-June 1996, Gabon reiterated that
it would leave unless its annual contribution to the organisation's
budget has been reduced in line with the size of its quota. This
matter was shelved until the next OPEC conference on June 5.

INDONESIA

Political stability and rapid economic growth in Indonesia are
inter-dependent and the prospects for 1996 are good. There is a
great deal of new foreign investment pouring into the country. The
list of investors for 1996 is long. For new private oil refining
projects, as one example, there were 33 different investment
proposals made in the past two years and the Board of Investment
only approved eight of them.

These include a $1.1 billion, 150,000 b/d export refinery to be
built by the private Saudi firm, Nimir Petroleum, in partnership
with Mitsui & Co. of Japan and PT Gigaraya International, a private
Indonesian company. The JV would be using Saudi crude oils. A larger
refining venture, for export, is being proposed by Indonesian
investors including a son of President Suharto, to be using Middle
East crudes.

Despite the country's gradual shift to natural gas, oil consumption
in Indonesia is exceeding 700,000 b/d and will reach 1 million b/d
by 2000. The country may become a net oil importer by 2005 or
shortly thereafter, if no major oil discoveries are made in the
meantime.

At present, Indonesia's oil production excluding condensates and
NGLs is averaging 1.33 million b/d, in line with its quota from
OPEC. The biggest investment in natural gas this century is to be
made by Exxon at Natuna, where it holds a major stake, with
Pertamina having agreed in principle to grant a 13% stake in this to
Mobil.

IRAN

Against an OPEC quota of 3.6 million b/d, Iran during the past
several weeks has been able to produce more than 3.75 million b/d.
Production from some onshore fields has improved, due to extensive
field work done by NIOC since early 1995, and offshore output has
risen as well.

The political situation in Iran will depend on the outcome of
general elections in April/May 1996. The current parliament, elected
in April/May 1992, is dominated by traditionalist hardliners who
have proved to be more negative towards the West than the ultra-
populists on the left who lost in the 1992 elections. In the
previous parliament, when the latter had a strong presence,
President Rafsanjani's pragmatic faction used to benefit
considerably from his balancing acts between the traditionalists and
the ultra-populists. Rafsanjani lost that balance in 1992 and has
since become weaker, with the traditionalists' behaviour doing their
country's economy more harm than its real enemies.

The confrontation with the US in late 1995 culminated in a new
measure by congress to punish those non-US companies which continue
to assist in Iran's hydrocarbon sector. In June 1995, Washington
imposed sanctions against Iran and in March had forced Conoco to
cancel a $900m deal to develop two of the Sirri offshore fields -
with Total of France having since signed a $600m agreement to
develop them. Although Tehran now says the US measures would not
harm Iran, in reality the country has begun to suffer more seriously
and its financial difficulties are getting worse. While France would
back Total and the Sirri development might go ahead as planned, no
other major project in this country would be financed by OECD states
or companies in the near future; none of the major banks will
finance any of the oil or gas pipelines proposed to pass through
Iran from Central Asia.

In November 1995 the oil ministry and NIOC held a four-day seminar
in Tehran and attracted about 40 foreign companies. The latter were
presented with 11 new oil and gas development projects worth over $6
billion, all requiring foreign investment on "buy-back" basis.

The foreign participants were told they would provide finance and
would be repaid in crude oil, gas or products from the completed
project. The profit margin offered was a bit better than the one
which the Japanese rejected in 1991, when a small offshore oilfield
at the Strait of Hormuz was to be developed and Japex was to act as
a competitive banker. NIOC asked the participants to come up with
bids by Jan. 1.

All those who are still interested in Iran are awaiting the outcome
of the April/May elections. By then they will have seen how the US
applied the tougher sanctions and how President Rafsanjani managed
to free himself from barriers imposed by the traditionalists. If the
traditionalists win again, the situation in Iran could worsen
further (see News Service).

One of the problems is that Iran is moving steadily to a point when
its oil consumption will exceed its exports. According to its
central bank governor Mohsen Nurbakhsh on Dec. 27, Iran's oil
consumption from March has risen to 1.4 million b/d - compared to
1.1 million b/d in the previous fiscal year to March 1995. This has
raised the "oil burden" on the state to almost $10 per annum. In its
new budget to March 1997, the government has forecast oil export
revenue at $15.9 billion, up 18% over March 1995-96 earnings.

The budget is based on an average price of $15.50/barrel for Iranian
crude oils, compared with $15/barrel for fiscal 1995-96. This seems
to be a bit optimistic, as the prospects for crude oil prices in
1996 are not very promising.

From March to end-1995, the actual price of Iranian crude oils
averaged slightly higher than $15/barrel. But in 1996 oil prices may
fall below that average.

Key factors of uncertainty for crude oil prices in 1996 include: (1)
Iraqi oil, with Baghdad under heavy pressure to allow partial sales
under a UN plan; (2) an increase in non-OPEC supplies, which is
almost certain if no major accident occurs (see study to be
serialised as from next week's Review); and (3) deflation in OECD
countries, if it continues.

IRAQ

There is no way that the UN sanctions against Iraq will be lifted in
1996 while Saddam Hussein is in power. The situation worsened after
Jordan's Dec. 26 announcement that it seized several kilos of three
"extremely dangerous" chemical components bound for Iraq, one month
after Jordan's seizure of a machine tool capable of fabricating
missiles and other weapons. As soon as the Iraqis learned of the
negative consequences, their dinar collapsed. At the same time,
pressures on Baghdad mounted from all directions; and France is
pressing hard for the Iraqi government to accept the UN plan for
partial oil sales which, among other things, should help finance UN
operations, as well as bring in food and medicines to the Iraqi
people.

Last week there were signs that Baghdad might soften its tone on
this. If Baghdad allows partial oil sales, to involve about 300,000-
400,000 b/d in 1996, prices would fall. This is because most OPEC
members are exceeding their quotas, with non-OPEC exporters
increasing their supplies in 1996 to take much of the 1.1 million
b/d boost in world oil demand. The prospects for Iraq might brighten
suddenly in 1997, after the US presidential election of November
1996, if Baghdad and Washington strike a deal related to the Middle
East peace process and other matters.

KUWAIT

Exceeding its 2 million b/d quota by a mere 45,000 b/d, Kuwait is no
longer happy with formula pricing based on sweet Brent and WTI
crudes. KPC wants to see a sour crude marker develop to replace
Dubai and become the benchmark for the pricing of its crudes as well
as those of Saudi Arabia and other Middle East exporters. At a
London conference last November, KPC marketing official Abdel Samad
Al Awadi suggested that Gulf producers sell part of their exports on
the spot market to create their own sour marker. But this depends on
acceptance by Saudi Aramco, whose pricing formula influences world
oil prices (see Downstream Trends).

Kuwait's political stability has improved in recent months and
further improvements are anticipated in 1996. Its oil production
capacity is being expanded according to plan, with downstream
operations overseas to be expanded further in 1996.

LIBYA

Exceeding its 1.39m b/d quota by about 30,000 b/d, Libya has a
number of internal problems caused primarily by UN sanctions imposed
since April 1992. An Islamic movement, spearheaded by militants
trained in Afghanistan to fight Soviet occupation, has declared a
holy war (Jihad) against Qadhafi's regime. One of its leaders,
Shaikh Abu Munther Al Saidi, has said the bloody events in June,
August and October 1995 were only "the beginning of the Jihad".

However, European oil companies have not stopped operating in Libya.
In fact several of them have increased their investment in the past
year.

NIGERIA

The political situation in Nigeria is very bad, because its military
dictator Abacha is holding on to power and is isolated
internationally. A US-EU oil embargo against Nigeria is unlikely,
however, and Shell has decided to go ahead with a very expensive LNG
project in the country.

Nigeria is exceeding its 1.865m b/d OPEC quota by about 100,000 b/d.
Like most other OPEC members, it will continue to produce at
capacity, which in 1996 will exceed 2m b/d.

QATAR

On June 27, 1995, Crown Prince Shaikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani
peacefully toppled his father - then on a tour abroad - and became
emir of Qatar. In the following months Hamad and his chief aides
began to upset Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in many ways and some of
them were too arrogant for the Egyptians, the Syrians and others.
They were too cordial to Israel and the US to bother with the
Saudis. But at the GCC summit on Dec. 4-5, Hamad walked out when the
Saudis got the council to choose their candidate, Jamil Hujailan, as
GCC secretary general. Later Doha threatened to leave the GCC if its
candidate and other demands were ignored.

Suddenly, however, Shaikh Khalifa appeared in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 24
and vowed he will return to Doha to regain power. Overtly, Hamad and
his aides ignored the warning and Khalifa's subsequent GCC tour; but
covertly they panicked and were no longer arrogant to the Egyptians
or Syrians.

Qatar is exceeding its 378,000 b/d quota by more than 85,000 b/d.
Its oil production capacity has risen to 465,000 b/d, due to a boost
in the output of Occidental Petroleum from less than 20,000 to
63,000 b/d. Further increases are evisaged by Oxy and Maersk this
year. Capacity will exceed 500,000 b/d by 1997. In November a spot
market in Al Shaheen sour crude, 30.3x API with 1.9% sulphur, was
created. The crude is produced offshore by Maersk at the rate of
20,000 b/d, to reach 30,000 b/d by end-1996.

Qatar is speeding up the diversification and privatisation of its
economy. At a conference in Doha on Jan. 8 it will present 15
industrial projects to about 300 Qatari, GCC and foreign investors.

The Prospects In OPEC Countries - SAUDI ARABIA

The situation in Saudi Arabia has improved considerably since the
Riyadh bomb explosion in November 1995 and the subsequent
hospitalisa-tion of King Fahd. The issue of succession to the throne
had been resolved prior to President Clinton's visit to the kingdom
in October 1994, and now Crown Prince Abdullah is the acting head of
state. To be the next king, he is the person who presides over
cabinet meetings and receives foreign leaders.

An air-tight power sharing agreement with "The Sudairi Seven" is yet
to materialise. But political stability is top priority for both the
conservative camp of Prince Abdullah and the progressive camp of
"The Seven". Washington will be happy with whatever arrangement both
sides may have in the coming months, provided that the outcome is
favourable, and there is a lot of horse trading going on in the
background.

The trend-setter for the neighbouring countries and the oil market,
Saudi Aramco has raised its crude oil prices for US customers in
January by 35 cents/barrel for Arabian Heavy and by 10 cents for
Extra Light. This follows changes in differentials between light and
heavy oil products and a large reduction in Saudi Aramco prices for
December.

        SAUDI PRICE DIFFERENTIALS FOR JANUARY 1996

$/barrel                       US1  Europe2  Far East3
Arabian Extra Light (Berri)  -2.05   -0.95     +1.20

Arabian Heavy                -3.70   -2.40     -0.55

Fob Ras Tanura: 1WTI, 2dated Brent, 3Oman/Dubai average

Saudi Aramco has the capacity to produce up to 10 million b/d of
OPEC speficication oil, plus 715,000 b/d of condensates and NGLs
which are excluded from the quota system. But it sticks to OPEC's 8
million b/d quota. Its monthly pricing influences the other NOCs of
the Middle East. This is particularly in the case of Kuwait's KPC,
which competes with Saudi Aramco in the US market, and of Iran's
NIOC which competes with the Saudi company in Europe and east of
Suez markets.

Riyadh wants to see crude oil prices defended by OPEC and IPEC. But
it also insists on expanding its market share.

The mix of Saudi Aramco's export crudes has become lighter and the
company has begun work on developing the Shaybah field, which will
be producing over 500,000 b/d of 42x API crude with 0.5% sulphur by
1999 and will raise Saudi supplies of such oils to almost 800,000
b/d (see detailed survey of Saudi Arabia & who's who in Vol. 45).

Politically stable as a confederation, rather than a full union as
its name suggests, the UAE has an OPEC quota of 2.161 million b/d
and is producing slightly more than that. The Acting Minister of
Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Rakad Bin Salim Bin Rakad, stated
on Dec. 7, 1995, that the UAE's oil production capacity had reached
3 million b/d.

Most of this capacity belongs to Abu Dhabi, by far the richest among
the seven UAE emirates with huge reserves of oil and gas (see survey

VENEZUELA

With an OPEC quota of 2.359 million b/d, Venezuela is actually
producing 2.75 million b/d and needs every dollar it can get. The
country has a deep financial crisis and a number of other problems
(see survey of Venezuela & who's who in Vol. 45, December 1995).

The Caracas government recently approved a joint venture between
Bitumenes del Orinoco (Bitor), one of PDVSA's subsidiaries, Conoco
of the US and Statoil of Norway. The JV will build a $320m plant to
produce Orimulsion, Venezuela's trademark boiler fuel excluded from
the OPEC quota. Production is to begin in 1998 at the rate of 5
million tons/year. About 80% of the output will be sold to Florida
Power and Light Co. and the remainder will be marketed in Europe.

In this JV, Bitor will hold 40%. Conoco will have a 30% stake and
Statoil will hold 20%. The remaining 10% will be held by two private
Venezuelan engineering companies.

OPEC Condensate & NGL Exports To Exceed 2.7M B/D: Production and
exports of condensates and NGLs in OPEC - excluded from the quota
system - have risen from less than 1.6 million b/d in the mid-1980s
to over 2.4 million b/d in recent months. They will exceed 2.7
million b/d before end-1996.

With further NGLs to come from large LNG export projects to be
completed in the following years, OPEC production of these liquids
could rise to more than 3.5 million b/d by 2000.

The biggest producer and exporter of these light/sweet liquids is
Saudi Aramco: 715,000 b/d to reach 720,000 b/d by end-1996. The
second is Algeria: 560,000 b/d to reach 580,000 b/d. The UAE:
326,000 b/d to reach 528,000 b/d. Indonesia: 230,000 b/d, to drop to
225,000 b/d by end-1996. Venezuela: 200,000 b/d to reach 220,000
b/d. Nigeria: 116,000 b/d to reach 130,000 b/d. Qatar: 95,000 b/d to
reach 130,000 b/d and 180,000 b/d in 1997. Kuwait: 105,000 b/d to

GCC Economies Grow Despite Lower Spending

The economic prospects in the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC)
countries appear to be bright. Higher oil prices and reforms boosted
their economies in 1995 despite lower government spending and a
decline in some sectors. But the six states are entering the 16th
year of their alliance with no signs that their targeted economic
merger will materialise anytime soon.

According to local officials and bankers, the oil sector alone in
the GCC has grown by around 8% as crude oil prices averaged nearly
$17/barrel in 1995, compared with $15.50/barrel in 1994. Oil prices
in 1996 may fall if Iraq returns to the market for partial oil sales
(see Oil Market Trends).

Khalid Al Fayez, chief executive of the Kuwaiti-based Gulf
Investment Corporation (GIC), which is owned by the six GCC
governments, says: "The performance of GCC economies recorded
positive rates and the results have surpassed expectations. Such
results were much better than in 1994. This is because the rise in
oil prices hastened growth rates". Bankers have estimated the
combined GDP in the GCC would grow by around 2.1% to $207.6 billion
in 1995, from nearly $203.2 billion in 1994.

A study by Henry Azzam, chief economist of the Saudi National
Commercial Bank, shows Saudi Arabia's GDP, which accounts for nearly
a quarter of the total Arab GDP, would likely rise to around $122
billion from $120.8 billion in 1994. Kuwait's GDP would increase to
$24.2 billion in 1995 from $22.9 bn and the UAE's to $38 billion
from $36.6 bn. Oman's GDP surged by more than 12% in the first half
of 1995 and was projected to grow by over 3% by end-1995. The
economies of the two other GCC members, Bahrain and Qatar, are also
set to grow.

This is in contrast with 1994, when most of the GCC economies
declined due to low oil prices. The decline occurred mainly in
government sectors.

According to the state-run Emirates Industrial Bank in the UAE, the
improvement in crude oil prices would boost the GCC's income by
around 10% to $77 billion in 1995, from around $70 billion in 1994.
The oil sector's contribution to the GDP ranges between 30% and 40%
in the GCC. The other key sectors are construction and trade.

Mahmoud Al Jarwani, director of the Muscat Stock Exchange, said in
late 1995: "I believe all GCC economies have grown because of the
oil price improvement and government measures to restructure the
economy. But some sectors have slightly retreated due to a drop in
investments and government expenditure". Most GCC states cut
spending in 1995 as part of reforms aimed at tackling their budget
deficit and reviving their economies after they were hurt by low oil
prices. From $71.4 billion in 1994, spending was trimmed to $68.79
billion in 1995, with most of the cut made by Saudi Arabia.

Lower government spending has a direct impact on the GCC economy, as
the private sector still relies heavily on such spending given its
relatively small contribution to the GDP. But such a contribution,
estimated at 35-40%, is set to surge in the coming years as regional
states are pressing ahead with reforms, which cover privatisation,
incentives for industries and improvement laws. The sale of key
institutions to the public is expected to fetch the governments
billions of dollars and ease the burden of subsidies.

GIC's Fayez urges GCC states to pursue privatisation plans and other
reforms to repair their economies and lessen reliance on volatile
oil earnings, which still account for more than 80% of their income.
"GCC countries should be fully committed to privatisation to
liberalise their economies and end bureaucracy and red-tape. But
privatisation needs changes in the existing economic laws. It means
not only the transfer of the ownership from the government to the
private sector, but also a change in the structure of companies and
their dealings".

Obstacles To Merger: The GCC states are yet to agree on a customs
union, a joint currency and other steps required for a common
market. Bahrain, which has little oil, fears lowering its tariffs
could hit its economy in view of its heavy reliance on taxes. Saudi
Arabia is also sticking to selective high tariffs to protect its
burgeoning industries as a means of lessening dependence on oil
exports. Although the six members have eased customs barriers among
them and facilitated the entry of their citizens, inter-GCC trade
has remained as low as 10% of their total trade of more than $100
billion per annum.

Egypt-Libya Trade Is Choked By Harsh New Measures

Egypt's Marsa Matruh, the once thriving market in Libyan goods has
become a ghost town after strict measures taken by Tripoli choked
off trade across the border. There used to be 5,000 travellers a day
crossing the town. Now there is only 50 at most. Sometimes it is
completely empty.

Mohammed Al Adl, head of customs at Egypt's Salloum border post,
said last week Libya "imposed a number of strict controls which
stopped the flow of trade between the two countries". Libya slapped
100% duties on merchandise entering from Egypt. Libyan officials at
the Misaed border post "confiscate without any reason all goods and
large amounts of money from travellers" coming from Libya, Idris Eid
Ali, who crossed into Egypt said. He added: "The economic situation
in Libya is collapsing and every hour there are new contradictory
(customs) orders issued".

The Salloum border crossing has been a vital trade outlet for Libya,
under a UN air embargo since 1992 for its alleged support of
terrorism. Travel between the two countries has always been simple
for their citizens, leading to a profitable trade in cheap Libyan
merchandise in Egypt.

In the coastal town Marsa Matruh, 250 km from the border, the
markets where most of the goods from Libya were sold are all but
empty from the cut-off. A trader who deals in Libyan merchandise in
Matruh said: "The town used to be packed with people and cars and
the trading went on 24 hours a day. Now there's not a single
customer after nine o'clock. On the best day, a merchant (at Matruh)
might make about 10 Egyptian pounds ($3). There are no customers and
no new goods coming in".

Besides random confiscations of goods, Libyan officials impose heavy
insurance on merchandise leaving Libya. But then it is very
difficult for the traveller to get back the insurance. One Egyptian
customs official added: "There is no system and no (Libyan) official
to turn to to complain. Every bureaucrat small and large considers
himself unsupervised and can do whatever he wishes".

The Libyan authorities have begun refusing to fill extra petrol
tanks in travellers' cars, in a bid to crack down on drivers who
sold Libyan gasoline at "enormous profit" in Egypt. Libyan customs
also force entrants to pay 50 Libyan dinars ($15) for a health
certificate in response to an Egyptian decision to give arrivals a
health test, after reports of a cholera outbreak in Libya.

Egyptian exports to Libya in 1994 amounted to $44.2 million. Imports
from Libya were worth $47.8 million. Libya has been Egypt's third
largest Arab trading partner, after Saudi Arabia and Syria.

Trade was dealt a heavy blow in September 1995 when Libya decided to
deport the 30,000 Palestinians living on its soil. Up to 1,000 of
the several thousand Palestinians expelled were refused entry by
Egypt and settled into a tent camp in no man's land between the two
borders.

The crisis stifled trade across the border even after Libyan leader
Qadhafi decided to stop the expulsions until 1996. Over a hundred
Palestinians still remain in the tent camp under harsh conditions.

Algeria Gets BP For Its Biggest Gas Project; Talks With Exxon Begin

On Dec. 23, 1995, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed an
agreement whereby BP and the state concern will invest about $3.5
billion to develop and market natural gas from seven fields in the
remote In Salah region. The gas will be marketed in Europe,
particularly in southern European countries, and will increase
Algeria's gas exports by more than 10 BCM/year from 2002. Further
increases in gas exports are envisaged for the following years.

The deal with BP represents the biggest foreign investment in
Algeria since it gained its independence from France in 1962. It
comes on the heels of President Zeroual's electoral victory (see OMT
& News Service of this week's APS Diplomat.

It paves the way for other international investments in Algeria's
energy sector, which accounts for virtually all the country's export
earnings, with Exxon negotiating a similar agreement for In Salah
gas.

Explored by Sonatrach, the seven fields lie in the hitherto
undeveloped In Salah District Three, about 1,200 km south of
Algiers. They are believed to be rich in natural gas and some
liquids.

In the initial phase, 30 months, BP will spend about $100 million on
an appraisal of the fields' known gas reserves, exploration and
analysis of the chemical composition of various gases in that
region. The aim of exploration is also to find other fields in
District Three. The $100 million spending will be borne by BP alone.

In Salah, a vast desert region, has 30 fields discovered by
Sonatrach. Their reserves have been estimated at between 150,000-
280,000 MCM. But BP has had doubts about these estimates and will
carefully re-assess data and the deposits at the seven fields found
in District Three.

The deal took five years to negotiate and an initial agreement in
1993. It involves a complicated arrangement relating to production
and the quality of the In Salah gas, which is poor relative to the
gas being produced at Hassi R'Mel, Algeria's main gas production
centre to the north. It includes a swap of In Salah gas for Hassi
R'Mel gas.

After the 30-month exploration phase, if the results are positive, a
five-year development programme will be launched. BP will produce 10
BCM/year from 2002 or 2003.

With gas treatment facilities to be set up at the fields, a 520-km
pipeline will be built from District Three to Hassi R'Mel. The
pipeline will cost about $1 billion. At Hassi R'Mel, the gas will be
reinjected to free more of the higher quality of the centre's gas
for export.

From there, the gas will be linked to Algeria's export network: (a)
the Trans-Med pipeline to Italy, and (b) the pipeline to Spain and
France which will pass through Morocco and the Strait of Gibraltar.

Joint gas marketing companies will be established in Europe by
Sonatrach and BP. The British major is expected to provide
considerable assistance in markets that will have become totally
deregulated by 2000 (see reports on following pages). There will be
emphasis on Germany, the largest gas market in Europe, where BP has
a stake in a major gas company.

The BP-Sonatrach partnership will last 30 years. The agreement was
signed at a ceremony in Hassi Messaoud, Algeria's southern oil
centre, by BP's CEO John Browne and Nazim Zouioueche, the head of
Sonatrach. The ceremony was attended by Ammar Makhloufi, Algeria's
minister of energy and industry.

Accordingly, BP will provide 65% of the total investment. In return,
it will get about a third of the profits. There is a confidential
portion in the agreement which provides for other companies to use
the pipeline for a fee.

Makhloufi said the BP deal would be a model for future gas
development and marketing agreements with other international
companies. Browne said: "It is the first major gas joint venture a
foreign company has signed with Sonatrach. It has the potential to
open up a new area of gas production in Algeria. He added that the
deal should raise by 30% BP's natural gas production worldwide,
which in 1994 amounted to 1.12 BCM (13 BCF).

BP will set up its own quarter at the heavily-guarded Hassi
Messaoud, where most of the 32 western oil and gas companies have a
base. It will post 25 of its staff members there and in District
Three, which will be heavily guarded by the army as well.

Browne and his aides had flown direct from London to a small
airstrip at Hassi Messaoud, where the army has heavy fortifications
against Islamic militants. BP will be hiring its own security
experts there and in District Three, and will be chartering its own
aircraft for the staff - as the other foreign operators in Algeria
have done.

At least six army units guard the installations in and around Hassi
Messaoud. At the air strip, soldiers with AK-47 assault rifles stand
silhouetted at the top of the surrounding, honey-coloured sand
dunes. The area is part of four exclusion zones in the south,
established in mid-1995, requiring special permission for entry by
visitors. Soldiers are stationed outside many pumping stations
across the desert. Helicopters routinely monitor the pipelines,
which are buried 3 to 4 metres under the sand.

Exxon Negotiations: Initial negotiations between Sonatrach and Exxon
began in the past week with the aim of signing a gas partnership
deal similar to BP's. If an agreement is signed, which Minister
Makhloufi hopes would be within 1996, Exxon would take some of the
remaining In Salah fields.

After an initial period for field appraisal and exploration, if the
results are positive, Exxon would develop the structures.
Eventually, it would use the 520-km pipeline to Hassi R'Mel which BP
will build from In Salah. Makhloufi says there would be a total of
three to four partnerships with foreign companies for In Salah gas.

Total-Sonatrach Gas Deal

Sonatrach and Total of France were this week expected to sign a
contract for the development of a gas field at Tin Fouye Tadankort
(TFT). The field lies in south-eastern Algeria near the Libyan
border.

The contract involves a production sharing arrangement. The French
company will cover most of the investment required and projects
there include a pipeline to link the gas with Algeria's network.

On Dec. 22, Minister Makhloufi and officials from Sonatrach
inaugurated oil and condensate processing facilities at Bin Rebba,
part of the Hamra field development undertaken by Total. They also
inaugurated Total's new gas treatment complex built at Hamra. The
Hamra project, to produce LPG as well as condensates, includes a
joint Sonatrach-Total company to market the LPG.

Zouioueche, the head of Sonatrach, says Algeria is taking steps to
maintain the momentum of foreign interest and investment. New
exploration acreage will be offered for foreign companies, although
Algeria appears more interested in negotiating specific arrangements
with individual companies than in launching a new international
bidding round. He says there is a continual reassessment of the
fiscal terms being offered to foreign companies. "We think the
current ones are attractive enough, but we must be prepared to adapt
to growing international competition", he adds.

Zouioueche has ambitious plans to revitalise Sonatrach. "Our goal",
he says, "is to have a state company that is managed like a private
company". He is keen to expand international activities. Algerian
officials say part of the attraction of the BP deal, and the one
with Exxon to follow, is that it opens the prospect of moving into
new "middle stream markets" in Europe, such as power generation.

Zouioueche says Sonatrach, which already has a stake in Anadarko,
the US oil explorer, is keen to acquire additional overseas assets.
That could include taking equity in other companies, including gas
marketing companies in Europe. "We're open to any possibilities to
become more international", he says.

At home, Sonatrach will be offering more opportunities for foreign
companies to take part in rehabilitating existing oilfields.
Zouioueche says a $1.3 bn contract on enhanced oil recovery being
negotiated with Arco will form the basis for future oilfield
rehabilitation projects. "But we can't do other ones until the Arco
deal is signed", for the Rhourde El Baguel oilfield (see details in
survey of Algeria in Review's Vol. 44).

Anadarko, meanwhile, has begun negotiating with Chemical Bank and
other banks to finance the development of 1.5 billion barrels of oil
reserves it has found in Algeria. Its partners in these reserves are
Lasmo of the UK and Maersk of Denmark.

The reserves lie in the group's Hassi Berkine fields which, if
developed as planned by Anadarko, would produce 40,000 b/d from late
1996 or early 1997. A full-scale development, to cost over $1
billion, would raise its production to 300,000 b/d by 2000. The
fields will produce natural gas as well.

The European Gas Market Develops; The British Could Buy From Retail
Shops

A spot market in natural gas developed in 1995 at Bacton, on the
British east coast, is becoming the main price market for spot
trades in Europe. With the players having acquired experience from
trading in North Sea oil, it provides forward contracts. Eventually
this would lead to a gas futures market similar to that of NYMEX in
New York which was launched in 1990.

However, the new spot market has caused the gas industry a serious
crisis. As a result of free competition in less than six months, gas
prices fell to about 10 pence a therm ($1.55/million BTU) in
November 1995.

To compare, the value of natural gas in Britain in November 1994 was
almost 20 pence a therm ($3.10/million BTU).

Further pressures on gas prices in Europe would be expected by April
1998, when the UK gas and power businesses will be totally
deregulated. From then on, British consumers could buy electricity
or gas at the supermarket or in chain stores. This form of trade
will influence price trends at Bacton.

Many big retailers have already had talks with the British
electricity regulatory body, Offer, about plans to sell power as
from 1998. They have had negotiations with British Gas for the
retailing of both gas and electricity, though BG is having its own
retailing plans.

The British electricity regulator, Prof. Stephen Littlechild, said
on Dec. 28 that many retailers were considering the sale of
electricity and gas once regional distributors lose their monopoly
in supplying households. The market for 20 million British
households is worth about $12.5 billion per annum. He told 'The
Times': "All of these (retail) chains realise that they have
strengths and the resources which could be of use in the electricity
market".

No new wires for power or pipelines for gas will be required.
Retailers would use their purchasing power to buy large supplies of
gas and electricity at bulk discounts, and then could sell the
unused surplus to customers. The gas or power distributor would
receive a fee from the retailer to reroute the supplies.

According to Littlechild, supermarkets are well placed to sell
electricity in the free-for-all consumer market about to be created:
they are used to driving hard bargains with suppliers and making
slim margins on large volumes. As large-scale customers, these
retailers have been able to achieve savings of 30% or more on their
bills through a competitive tender process. This involves the
various private sector suppliers.

British Gas, the former state monopoly, is already bracing for the
tough new competitive market. It has secured a licence to supply
households with both gas and electricity, in the expectation that
consumers would prefer one major and reliable supplier.

NYMEX Begins Trading New Futures Based West Texas Gas

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) this week was expected to
begin trading a new gas futures contract based on delivery at the
Permian pool of El Paso Natural Gas Company in West Texas. The
contract is partly similar to the one trading on the NYMEX market
since 1990, with its gas based on the Henry Hub in Louisiana.

The difference is that the Louisiana-based contract expires on the
sixth to the last business day of the month, whereas the new near-
month contract expires on the third to the last business day. The
new contract competes with the Western gas futures contract of the
Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT), which is based on the Waha Hub in
west Texas. The KCBT Western contract expires on the fifth to the
last business day of the month.

NYMEX has promoted the idea since mid-1995. It wants to give traders
in natural gas futures an alternative site to trade. This is to give
further arbitrage opportunities.

Herndon Begins Stint At Florida Pension Plan

The six-month search by Florida State Board of Administration for an executive
director finally came to an end Nov. 12 when John (Tom) Herndon assumed his new
position as chief executive officer of the $55 billion pension.


Mr. Herndon replaced Ash Williams, the previous executive director, and
inherited the alternatives program review Mr. Williams started before he left
this May to join Schroeder Capital Management as executive vice
president (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 6).

Mr. Herndon's appointment, announced in late October, was not without
controversy: A lobbyist and well-known public figure in Florida, Mr. Herndon's
resume was studded with long stints in government but was noticeably shorter on
investment experience, and his selection sparked questions in the industry
regarding his fitness to manage one of the country's largest pension plans.

"I understand the concerns expressed," Mr. Herndon said. "But [Florida State
Board] is a large complex organization with a variety of activities and
concerns, not all of which are investment related, and the board has selected
someone who can put together a solid team, deal with all the activities and
pull the whole thing together."

Prior to joining the board, Mr. Herndon was president of Tom Herndon &
Associates, a government lobbying and consulting firm. His public service
record included positions as chief of staff under two Florida governors-current
Governor Lawton Chiles and Bob Graham, now senator-where for five years he was
director of the governor's office of planning and budgeting. Besides serving on
the Florida House of Representatives, he also spent two years as the executive
director of Florida's Department of Revenue.

"I guess the need was for a seasoned [manager] with strong oversight of
external forces affecting the pension, i.e., the legislature, and he was best
suited for the part," said a source familiar with the pension who asked not to
be named.

At the time of Mr. Williams' departure, the Florida legislature was reviewing
its current restriction on partnership investments, possibly paving the way for
an expanded program (BUYOUTS June 10, p. 4). The pension also was reviewing its
private equity program and was considering new strategies to broaden its
alternatives investment portfolio, including buyout funds and direct
investments.

Before its September commitment of $200 million to The Carlyle Group's Carlyle
Leveraged Capital Partners II, L.P. (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 9),  Florida had
nearly $800 million earmarked for buyouts that was primarily invested by
Liberty Partners, New York.

Mr. Herndon was picked over other candidates with strong investment track
records, sources said, because the pension did not expect to rely on the new
director to drive its day-to-day management. Mr. Herndon said he expects to set
broad policies and structure a new program where the monitoring will be left to
deputies with more investment experience.

Currently, Lan Janecek is the board's chief of equities, and Irwin Loud is the
private equity portfolio manager.

The board has not set a formal timetable for the review. "During the transition
from Ash to myself, which took six months, my sense is the board was sitting at
a red light on the street," Mr. Herndon said. "Now its a flashing yellow light,
and I'm proceeding with caution. I'm not adverse to new deals and areas, but
I'm not jumping into anything quickly."

Sources said Mr. Herndon likely will continue the broad game plan started by
Mr. Williams, which emphasizes the expansion of alternatives investing with a
view to stepping up direct or co-investments. Kopin Tan.

Hancock Team Plans Secession Before Fund Launch

The partners and management team of Hancock Venture Partners is in the process
of buying the private equity arm of the business from parent John Hancock
Mutual Life Co., after which the team likely will launch a fifth domestic
fund-of-funds expected to land close to $1 billion.

Hancock's management team at press time was finalizing the buyout, expected to
close by early January, through which the firm's 11 general partners will buy
Hancock's buyout and venture capital operation from its parent holding company
and run the new entity with its current staff of 49 investment personnel fully
intact.

Brooks Zug, the buyout arm's co-founder and general partner, said the move was
necessary because Hancock Venture Partners has outgrown its parent holding
company's compensation structure. He said it would be difficult to continue to
attract and to keep top industry professionals without giving them a chance to
build equity ownership.

"It worked well for 15 years, and it might have continued to work a while
longer, but the economic rewards and controls had to shift in a direction to
the people that give a value to the investors," he said.

The price of the transaction has not been finalized.
Following the transaction, the new entity is expected to continue investing and
managing Hancock Venture Partners' existing $2.2 billion in assets under
management, including all prior funds the firm has raised, Mr. Zug said.

Commitments from parent John Hancock Mutual Life accounted for only 3% of
Hancock Venture Partner's assets under management, and industry sources said
the firm's rebirth is unlikely to diminish the team's existing clout.

The new entity has yet to finalize its name. Although it may include a
reference to Hancock, it will likely be used temporarily and for a short time,
Mr. Zug said. "All details are not ironed out, and there is still some work to
be done," he said.

L.P. sources who have invested with Hancock said the firm's general partners
had been working on the move for some 18 months, and may have held off the
official launch of its fifth domestic fund because there are investors who may
be waiting for the changes to be finalized before they make their commitments.
The fear, an L.P. source said, is that some of the Hancock general partners may
leave should the acquisition fall through.

Mr. Zug said he does not believe the investors will be unduly concerned about
the change in ownership and name.

"I view the spin-off as positive, and if we chose to invest in them again, it
would be contingent on the deal," said Robert Borden, chief investment officer
at Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System.
U.S. Fund V May Breach $1 Billion

Darrell Allen, the investment officer at Denver Public School Employees'
Pension & Benefit said the establishment of the group as a separate firm is
unlikely to negatively impact the plan's existing relationship with the Hancock
team. Investors said the launch of a new domestic fund-of-funds likely will be
announced the same time the ownership change is finalized.

L.P. sources said the new vehicle, Hancock's fifth domestic fund, will feature
a $750 million goal and will be capped at $1 billion.

Hancock's previous U.S. fund, the $353 million Hancock Venture Partners IV,
L.P., was launched in 1993 and is fully invested. New partnership and secondary
investments represented $196 million of the fund and direct investments $156
million.

The only fund not fully invested by Hancock Venture Partners is the $950
million fund-of-funds Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P.,
(BUYOUTS July 8, p. 23) which held a final close early this year. It is now 40%
invested.

More than half of the $2.2 billion under the management of Hancock Venture
Partners is targeted for international funds, and Mr. Zug said his group will
continue to offer its investors both domestic and overseas opportunities.

"The two parts of our business here have always been integrated,"  Mr. Zug
said. "We've never contemplated splitting them apart."* By Josh Kosman

Despite LBO Firm Neglect, Mezzanine Funds Thrive

When Boston's Bain Capital found itself with an oversubscribed equity fund
earlier this year, its partners came up with a way to tap investor interest
without biting off more equity than it could chew, and Bain Capital V Mezzanine
Fund, L.P. went from concept to closing.

"We thought there was a shortage of mezzanine," says Geoffrey Rehnert, a Bain
managing director. And given the oft-touted perception of mezzanine funds as
ignored by investors and squeezed out of deals by aggressive senior lenders and
roaring junk bond and 144(A) markets, it seems a sound rationale.

But subordinated debt funds were not so much a dark horse as a quiet one. Like
equity funds, these partnerships have experienced a record fund-raising year in
1996 and, like buyout funds, have been busy finding under-the-radar
alternatives in order to put their money to work.

Whether their approach will be successful as they wait for more equilibrium
with other debt sources remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that
while a strong mezzanine contingency is not what buyout funds need right now, a
lack of established sub-debt funds could have serious repercussions for the
buyout industry should the public market and senior lenders pull back.

So far in 1996 there have been roughly a dozen mezzanine-fund closings that
have raised about $2.3 billion, a 143% increase from 1995, according to
BUYOUTS. The sponsors are Capital Resource Lenders, Canterbury Capital, L.L.C.,
Crescent Capital Corp., LPNY Advisers, Retail & Restaurant Growth Capital,
L.P., Frazier & Co., Bain Capital, Green Mountain Advisors, Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co., Summit Partners and Cigna Investment Management.

On top of that there have been five other funds launched this year, including
those by August Partners and GarMark Advisors L.L.C., looking to raise an
additional $1.475 billion.

The wealth of fund raising in 1996 follows several years of slow struggle. In
1992, $786 million was raised among mezzanine funds, which was followed by a
39% drop in 1993 to a total of $482 million.

But beginning in 1994, mezzanine funds began to show a turnaround. In 1994, the
funds totaled $909 million, an 89% increase from the year before. In 1995, the
aggregate was $945 million, not accounting for the $1.425 billion raised by
Forstmann Little & Co., which is being excluded from the data because the firm
uses the fund for its own deals and does not lend to others.

What seems to be driving the mezzanine fund-raising market, sources say, is the
greater appetite on the part of foreign investors.

"[Domestic investors] looking at mezzanine funds ask themselves 'Why would I do
that if we get [a return of] 20% to 25% when we could put it into private
equity and make 50%,'" relates Bob Mast, a placement agent at Boston-based
Monument Group.

International Investors Drive Market
Conversely, many investors from overseas have more modest expectations.

"Many international investors are attracted to the current yield a mezzanine
fund provides," says Robert Gould, a senior manager at Brown Brothers Harriman
& Co., which is  raising a mezzanine fund. "Additionally, it provides good
returns even if the IPO market doesn't do well in the next five years."

The fund, called 1818 Mezzanine Fund, was launched in May and is expected to
close in the first two weeks of December with more than $200 million (see
story, p. 6).

At first glance, the rise in mezzanine fund raising seems paltry compared to
the skyrocketing levels of pure equity. Buyout funds have raised more than $20
billion so far this year, already exceeding 1995's final tally of $18.4 billion
(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1).

But a closer look at the proportion of mezzanine to equity shows that mezzanine
pools have been gaining ground. In the early '90s, for example, the pool of
mezzanine capital ran at about 8% of equity funds. Although that dipped to
about 5% last year, 1996 has reversed the trend. Mezzanine fund raising this
year totals 13.4% of the aggregate total of buyout funds raised.

While most sources and the numbers agree that it is a good time to raise
capital, not all mezzanine funds have had immediate success. August Partners,
based in New York with a fund launched in late winter, has yet to hold a first
closing on its $100 million target. A much more ambitious target, $750 million,
was set by New York's GarMark, which also has not held a close although
industry sources had hinted earlier this year that they were very close
(BUYOUTS April 8, p. 6). GarMark could not be reached for comment at press
time.

Both these funds are debut efforts, which may be influencing their ability to
draw investors. But GarMark's fund, one of the largest mezzanine partnerships
contemplated, may be a victim of its own size.

Sources that are successfully raising and deploying mezzanine funds say they
are doing so because of their approach: searching for smaller deals or
restructurings where they can put their money to work.

"We are looking for deals at the lower end of the spectrum with smaller funds
or possibly individual deals," says Nicholas Dunphy, a managing general partner
at New York's Canterbury Capital. "I maintain that if you stick with smaller
deals, and create good relationships, there will be enough worthy deals to make
a good investment."

If GarMark reached its target, the fund may be too large to go after the
smaller deals that mezzanine funds are eyeing, and the larger deals that could
effectively put GarMark's fund to work currently are more interested in
cheaper, public debt.

Taking Advantage of the Little Deal
Following a similar story to the equity-fund dilemma of having lots of investor
interest but limited avenues for deployment, mezzanine funds, too, have been
reinventing the kinds of deals they pursue.

For instance, many mezzanine funds that initially were conceived as supporting
structures for buyouts are instead going after their own smaller deals or
helping out companies that need capital for a purchase of another product line,
not a buyout itself.

"The funds that can do this can handle [any squeeze]," says Jim Reinhardt, a
managing director of the California-based Pathway Capital Management.

For instance, Mr. Dunphy says Canterbury's strategy has been to look for
smaller deals rather than to try to provide mezzanine financing for mega-deals.


His firm's fund, Canterbury Mezzanine Capital, L.P., which was launched last
September, most recently held a first closing on $135 million (BUYOUTS Sept.
25, 1995, p. 1, p. 16) and is looking for a final close by January at $150
million.

For its first deal, Canterbury committed $5 million in subordinated debt to
Chartwell Investments's acquisition of Petro Stopping Centers (BUYOUTS Nov. 11,
p. 6).

Canterbury Capital looks for deals between $2 million and $15 million and, with
a range like that, "you will always find a company looking for growth capital
or debt," Mr. Dunphy adds. Canterbury's overall return objective is 20% to 25%.


While the Brown Brothers mezzanine fund takes a larger approach-seeking
investments between $25 million and $75 million in company worth between $150
million to $200 million-the strategy still is to complete deals that are too
small for its second buyout fund, 1818 Fund II, which closed last year on $475
million.

"Mezzanine is the appropriate tool for investments we want to make with smaller
companies, because you can't be as confident that companies will go public
afterwards," Mr. Gould says.

A large part of the mezzanine fund's strategy is to find investment situations
that would not be appropriate for a financial sponsor, such as a family-owned
business where no one wants to replace the financial structure. "There is some
opportunity in leveraged buyouts, but that is not where our focus will be," Mr.
Gould adds.

A Maturing Mezzanine Market
Even as mezzanine funds are finding new footholds to bridge the gap between
investor appetites and financial sponsors' interest, there are signs the
mezzanine market is coming into its own.

LPNY Advisers, based in New York, has dedicated a recent fund raising to
secondary interests in mezzanine funds. The fund, which was launched earlier
this year, closed on $225 million this summer, exceeding its $200 million
initial target. So far, commitments have been drummed up from Pennsylvania
Public School Employes' Retirement System, BancBoston Capital, Houston
Firemen's Relief & Retirement Fund, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance, IBM
Retirement Plan, Wolfson Equities and Paris-based Euristech (BUYOUTS Aug. 5, p.
7).

"Certainly, mezzanine does get a little squeezed when equity providers have so
much money," says Monument's Mr. Mast. "But even if all discipline goes out the
window, [mezzanine] will still have a place in the market."

That mezzanine funds are a maturing market also readily can be seen by buyout
firms, riding high on equity but delving into sub debt as well. Besides Bain
Capital and Brown Brothers Harriman, Boston's Summit Partners is raising a
mezzanine fund called Summit Subordinated Debt Fund II, L.P., which is readying
its first, and perhaps final, closing at between $250 million and $300 million
(see story, this page).

But, because of the abundance of cheaper forms of debt, even some of those
buyout firms that might have first anticipated using their new mezzanine funds
to bolster their own deals may be rethinking their plan.

To date, Bain has used its mezzanine fund, which raised about $250 million, for
its own deals-but now is interested in using the fund for mezzanine lending to
other buyout groups, Mr. Rehnert says.

"I think we are trying to market mezzanine and come up with a formula to price
deals but with better risk," he says. Tanya Bielski

Kidd Kamm's Hamburg In Industrial Renaissance

Eric Hamburg, a partner at Kidd, Kamm & Co., in November founded Industrial
Renaissance Inc., a buyout investment firm that will focus on operational
improvement of industrial and manufacturing companies.

The new firm remains a one-man show for now, although Mr. Hamburg said he has
rounded up two potential partners who soon will come on board the Stamford,
Conn., enterprise. He declined to name the individuals, but said they shared a
strong operational background.

The move follows a decision by Kidd Kamm partners to go their separate ways
over a disagreement about the firm's investment direction. While Kidd Kamm will
continue managing its existing portfolio, partners Kurt Kamm and Terry Theodore
will launch a buyout fund early next year under the banner Kamm, Theodore & Co.
(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1), while William Kidd has opted to tackle ad hoc deals
through his own buyout shop, Kidd & Co. (BUYOUTS Oct. 28, p. 3).

Mr. Hamburg declined to add further comment on the Kidd Kamm split, except to
say the firm had reached a point where it became apparent the decision was
appropriate.

Industrial Renaissance will target leveraged build-ups of middle-market
manufacturing companies in fragmented industries, as well as of stand-alone
acquisitions of under-performing businesses. Industries the firm will focus on
include industrial and consumer products, and low- to mid-tech manufacturing.
It will steer clear of retail and service companies.

Target businesses will have sales between $15 million and $150 million.

"We're looking for companies with weaker systems and operational processes we
can upgrade-the type of deals we can understand and which a truly financial
buyer may not get their hands around," he added.

The firm has enough committed capital-from individuals, corporations and the
potential partners-to approach deals, he said, and does not plan to raise a
fund. "We don't want to be money managers."

Industrial Renaissance owes much of its operational bent to Mr. Hamburg's
background. Before joining Kidd Kamm in 1993, he spent eight years at Andersen
Consulting, where as senior manager he led and managed the implementation of
business turnarounds. Kopin Tan.

LACERA Adviser Search Ends with Hamilton Lane

Los Angeles County Employees' Retirement Association on Nov. 20 appointed
Hamilton Lane Advisors as the pension's new investment manager for private
equity assets after five years of entrusting the 6% allocation to Chancellor
Capital Management.

The appointment ended a six-month search initiated at the request of the $20
billion pension's board of directors following a series of defections among
Chancellor's ranks (BUYOUTS July 22, p. 1).

According to David Locke, LACERA's investment officer for alternative assets,
the allocation Hamilton Lane will be responsible for has not yet been
determined. That decision is pending the final agreement with the
Philadelphia-based consultant, which should be presented to the board in
January.

The pension has determined, however, that the Hamilton Lane relationship will
be a discretionary one, similar to its prior arrangement with Chancellor.

Mr. Locke said the pension staff had been satisfied with Chancellor's
performance and the switch in consultants was at the direction of the board. A
source close to the board pointed out, in an earlier interview, that some board
members thought Chancellor did not fairly review certain key partnerships the
board had been interested in.

Despite a current 6% allocation to private equity, Mr. Locke said Chancellor's
recent mandate was to invest about $350 million annually, and, Mr. Locke said,
Hamilton Lane likely would be targeting the same amount, "depending on the
market and circumstances."

Historically, Chancellor committed some $540 million of new capital from the
beginning of its tenure with LACERA in December 1991 through Sept. 30 of this
year, in addition to reinvesting distributions.

The LACERA definition of alternative assets is oriented solely on private
equity, including buyouts, venture capital, mezzanine, secondary purchases and
distressed and turnaround situations. Real estate has a separate allocation and
is considered by the pension to be a mainstream, traditional investment.

Mr. Locke said he expected Hamilton Lane to establish on an annual basis its
own investment plan that would be reconciled with an overall strategic plan for
alternative assets that is being developed by LACERA staff, aided by Frank
Russell Co. According to Mr. Locke, the majority of the plan has been drawn up
and is being fine-tuned; it should be unveiled and implemented around the
middle of the first quarter, he said.Jennifer Lea Reed.

Advent Kicks Off Third International Effort

Advent International Corp. last month launched a third international buyout
fund targeting established European and Asian markets, said Douglas Brown,
president of the Boston-based firm.

Offering documents for Global Private Equity III, L.P. feature a $600 million
goal, although the firm hopes to raise a figure closer to $875 million-enough
to invest $250 million annually for three and a half years, said Tom Armstrong,
an executive vice president.

Half of the new fund likely will be invested in Europe, with 33% in America and
17% in Asia, Mr. Brown said. The fund will not invest in Latin America, which
already is the focus of Advent's $200 million Latin American Private Equity
Fund, L.P., which closed this fall (BUYOUTS Aug. 19, p. 7).

The new Europe- and Asia-focused fund will target 35 to 40 companies in the $10
million to $30 million range, focusing on low-risk investments in established
markets. "For example, we won't do deals in China but have invested in Taiwan,
Malaysia and Singapore," Mr. Brown said.

The minimum investment is $5 million, with $20 million being the average
commitment. Co-investments alongside the fund will be encouraged, Mr. Brown
said.

More than half of the fund will be invested in buyouts, with the balance in
recapitalizations and growth financings, he added. This represents an increase
in the percentage allotted to buyouts. In previous efforts, the firm invested
one-third of its funds in acquisitions (BUYOUTS Oct. 23, 1995, p. 5).

The general partners will commit capital amounting to 1% of the fund.

Advent's second international fund raised $313 million in 1994. Global Private
Equity II, L.P. is now 85% invested in 50 companies, with returns in excess of
50%, Mr. Brown said. An additional $47 million will be invested by the end of
the year, he added.

The fund recently invested $35 million in Technologistica, an Italian
outsourcer of logistics management (BUYOUTS Nov. 11, p. 16). Advent
International currently has 70 investment professionals on its team, including
at least 40 who are based in Europe, Mr. Brown said.

PPM America Markets First U.S. Distressed Fund

Already the third largest institutional property owner in the U.K. behind only
the Church of England and the British Crown, Prudential Corp. plc is marketing
to U.S. investors a debut distressed fund with a $300 million goal.

Launched earlier this year by PPM America, Prudential's U.S. equity investment
arm, the fund already has rounded up $154 million largely from Prudential
affiliates in a first closing this June and now is stepping up its fund raising
among other U.S. investors.

A second closing with commitments from U.S. investors is expected early next
year, said a source at the firm.

PPM America Special Investments Fund, L.P.'s $300 million target will break
down as follows: a little more than $100 million in limited partnership
interests from Prudential affiliates, nearly $96 million from U.S. investors
and $100 million in debt.

The fund's June 21 first closing landed $25 million from an affiliate of
Prudential Corp., $75 million from Jackson National Life Insurance Co. and $50
million in senior secured notes from Transamerica Business Credit Corp. and
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.

After the firm raises the remaining $96 million in L.P. interests, PPM America
will round up fund raising with another $50 million debt tranche.

While a leveraged fund is not in itself unusual, industry sources said, it has
not been widely used as a fund-raising tool. "We look at the debt chunk as an
advantage for our investors that will give a bigger kick in terms of returns,"
said Stuart Lissner, a vice president of PPM's special investments group.

PPM sources said leveraging the fund conservatively also does not significantly
increase its risk profile; at the same time, it helps boost the fund size for
the first-time vehicle.

"We're paying 9% on one-third of our capital," which is only marginally higher
than the 8% hurdle rate paid to the fund's limited partners, said Brian
Schinderle, another PPM vice president. "The issue is how you want to structure
your capital."

According to the offering documents, the fund's strategy involves targeting
majority control positions in debt and equity of financially troubled companies
and other special situations. Approximately 80% of the fund will be deployed in
distressed debt, Mr. Lissner said, taking advantage of an inefficient market
for distressed securities.

The Chicago-based firm also has recruited in the past months a team of
investment professionals to help raise the fund and put it to work. They
include Mr. Schinderle, who until August was a founder and manager of Sanwa
Business Credit Corp.'s special situations group; Bradley Scher, a former
director of distressed loans for Teachers Insurance; Levoyd Robinson, who until
May oversaw First Chicago Capital Corp.'s distressed portfolio; David
Dieffenbacher, a former associate with First Chicago; and Brian Baldwin, an
associate and formerly an auditor at Grant Thornton LLP.

The team is headed by John Stark, a senior vice president who founded PPM's
special investments group in 1990.Kopin Tan.

Gen Cap America Readies $25 Mil. Fund IV

Gen Cap America in November kicked off fund raising for a fourth private equity
vehicle that will target small to mid-size companies located in the Southeast.

Southvest Fund IV, L.P. targets $25 million and will focus on sponsoring
management-led buyouts, said a source at the Nashville, Tenn., firm.

Gen Cap's principals, who are expected to commit as much as $3 million of their
own capital, declined to comment, citing the regulatory silent period.

Southvest Fund III, L.P. rounded up more than $5 million in 1995 and will be
completely invested by the end of this year. The firm to date has raised nearly
$13 million in three prior vehicles- named Southvest because Gen Cap invests in
the Southeast-and the stepped-up goal of $25 million reflects the firm's
decision to make a more concerted stab at buyout investments.

The first three funds generated IRRs of 34%, the source said.
Southvest IV will target companies valued between $3 million and $50 million,
including divestitures of corporate divisions and privately held companies with
retiring and absentee owners.

Gen Cap has focused on the Southeast because the general partners believed the
region still has a large number of acquisition opportunities that are left
untapped by national investment firms, the source added.

Gen Cap America was founded in 1987. Barney Byrd is the firm's president;
Donald Napier is the senior vice president.Kopin Tan.

Brown Brothers to Close Debut Mezzanine Effort

Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in December will hold a first, and possibly
final, closing on more than $200 million for its first mezzanine fund, said
Robert Gould, a senior manager.

The mezzanine fund, named 1818 Mezzanine Fund after the year the investment
bank was founded, originally had a goal of between $100 million and $250
million, Mr. Gould said.

Brown Brothers kicked off its fund-raising effort in April (BUYOUTS  May 27, p.
4). The fund targets investments in smaller companies, focusing on mezzanine
tranches between $5 million and $20 million.

The fund was devised to fill a need outside the investment mandate of the
bank's two private equity funds, the $329 million 1818 Fund, and the $475
million 1818 Fund II. Both focused on non-controlling equity investments of
between $25 million and $75 million in companies valued at more than $200
million.

The mezzanine fund will be managed by Mr. Gould, who previously invested the
1818 equity funds, and Joe Donlan, the chief credit officer who headed the
investment bank's New York middle-market lending operations.Tanya.Bielski.

AAM Wraps First Effort After Landing $35 Million

Since Asset Allocation & Management held a $10 million final closing on its
debut fund in August, bringing the final tally to $35 million, the firm has
been busy investing and has put nearly one-third of the fund to work.

AAM Capital Partners, L.P. fell short of its $50 million goal set at the time
of its launch in June 1994 (BUYOUTS July 10, 1995, p. 8).  Tug Wilson, a
partner, said the firm decided to settle for the lower amount in order to
concentrate fully on deals.

The fund targets LBOs of middle-market insurance companies, Mr. Wilson said.

Lead investors in the fund include Chase Manhattan Bank, Allstate Insurance
Co., Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Swiss Reinsurance
Corp. and Banc One Capital Partners.

Mr. Wilson said that this is a good time to invest because of the
demutualization of the insurance industry. As much as 40% of the insurance
market is now mutually owned by policy holders, which means companies are not
able to have ready access to capital, Mr. Wilson said. He added that the fund
will give the Chicago-based group a chance to develop a track record investing
in the insurance industry.

The fund recently invested between $12 million and $13 million to attain
minority ownerships in San Francisco-based HomeVest Financial Group, New
York-based Universal American Financial Group and the Lancaster, Pa-based Old
Guard Group.

The firm also co-invests with other groups, deploying between $4 million and $5
million per acquisition, Mr. Wilson said.J.K

McCown Acquires Sarcom in $150 Mil. LBO

New York-based buyout firm McCown De Leeuw & Co. closed a $150 million
transaction for Sarcom, a Columbus, Ohio, computer systems integrator, on Nov.
15, said McCown Partner David King.

Funded by McCown De Leeuw & Co. III, L.P., the buyout firm committed $30
million in equity. Senior debt of $95 million was supplied by Banque Nationale
de Paris, of which more than $60 million will be dedicated to the company's
future growth. IBM Credit Corp. also put in $15 million.

Sarcom's management committed $10 million and holds a 25% stake in the company.

McCown will use the computer systems integrator as a new platform. The firm
foresees taking Sarcom to an initial public offering in the next few years but
in the meantime plans to grow the company through acquisitions, Mr. King said.

An add-on for the new platform was already underway, Mr. King said, although he
would not name the company as yet. He predicted, however, the acquisition would
increase Sarcom's revenue by 10%.

Sarcom, which is the twelfth largest local area network computer integrator in
the U.S., is expected to have 1996 sales of $250 million.*T.B.

American Securities Buys Burger King Its Way

American Securities Capital Partners recently completed its fourth investment
of the year when it acquired one of the five largest chains of Burger King
restaurants in the world.

The New York firm bought Caribbean Restaurants, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 8 for
about $150 million, including between nearly $40 million in equity, according
to a source close to the firm. Senior debt was provided by Texas Commerce Bank.

The newly acquired company has exclusive rights to the 111 Burger King
restaurants on Puerto Rico, according to Michael Fisch, an American Securities
director.

Mr. Fisch said Caribbean Restaurants, like the buyout firm's other investments,
had not been sourced through the usual investment banking avenues. "You get
more attractive pricing opportunities if you buy outside of broad auction," he
said.

Caribbean Restaurants reported sales of $140 million in 1996.
Mr. Fisch said three of the four investments made so far this year, including
Caribbean Restaurants, featured transaction prices of more than $100 million.
He added the firm targets acquisitions of industrial manufacturing, broadcast
or media companies and distributors of well-known consumer products.

American Securities closed this February on a $90 million fund that is 75%
invested, he said. The firm will think about launching a second fund sometime
in 1997.

Investments made by American Securities this year include MVE, a manufacturer
of vacuum-installation technology; Community Pacific Broadcasting, which owns
10 radio stations; and CTB, a manufacturer of poultry feeding equipment

Bain Sells Two Stakes, Closes First Hedge Fund

Bain Capital had a busy month in November, staging exits from two investments
and closing its first hedge fund.
The Boston-based buyout firm on Nov. 14 sold Experian Inc., a former credit
data subsidiary of TRW, a defense electronics company, for a return of 300%.

Bain worked alongside its fellow Beantown buyout group Thomas H. Lee Co.,
jointly acquiring an 84% stake in Experian for $1.01 billion. The buyout firm
invested approximately $100 million in the deal.

The sale, just seven weeks after the acquisition, gave the firm a profit nearly
three times its initial investment, said Geoffrey Rehnert, a Bain managing
director.

"We were lucky in that a European company we were interested in was interested
in [Experian]," Mr. Rehnert said. "They made us an offer, and it is one of
these fortunate things where everything fell into place."
Experian, based in Orange, Calif., was sold to Great Universal Stores PLC for
$1.7 billion.

The other Bain exit was on Nov. 1, when the buyout firm sold its interest in
Gilbert Engineering Co., a civil engineering company, for $125 million to Oak
Industries, Bain's partner in the Gilbert acquisition.

Bain and Oak Industries bought Gilbert in 1992.
The buyout firm made roughly 27 times its initial investment, Mr. Rehnert said,
but declined to mention how much money the firm paid four years ago for the
company.

Hedge Fund Nears $100 Million
The buyout firm also held a closing on $98 million for its first hedge fund on
Nov. 1, Mr. Rehnert said, although a few other investors may still straggle in.
Bain partners and employees committed $30 million; the remaining $68 million
was raised from other individuals.

The hedge fund is called Brookside Capital Partners, L.P. and will target
positions in public companies.T.B.

Saunders Karp  Takes Hibbett to IPO

New York-based Saunders Karp & Megrue completed an initial public offering for
Hibbett Sporting Goods in October, and, to date, has reaped a profit roughly
three times its initial investment, said John Megrue, partner at the firm and
the chairman of the board at Hibbett.

The company offered 2.3 million shares at a price tag of $16 a share. On the
first day of its trading, the stock closed at $20 a share. At press time, the
stock was being traded on Nasdaq at $15.

The buyout firm did not sell any of its own stock in the October offering.

Saunders Karp bought the sporting goods company a year ago for an undisclosed
price. Already, the firm has repaid most of the $35 million debt incurred by
the restructuring, Mr. Megrue said.

The firm opted to take Hibbett to an IPO because it can more aggressively fuel
the company's expansion, Mr. Megrue said.

Since the buyout firm's recapitalization, Hibbett has opened 19 more stores
across the country, taking the total to 82.

Saunders Karp paid for the acquisition with equity from its first vehicle, SK
Equity Fund.

The firm currently is raising its second fund, SKM Equity Fund II, which
features a goal of $400 million (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 8).T.B.

Amendment Widens  The 100 Investor Rule

An Oct. 11 amendment to the 1940 Investment Company Act that will take effect
within the next six months is expected to give buyout firms greater flexibility
in future fund raisings.

Whereas general partners previously had to restrict the number of investors in
a fund to less than 100 to avoid registration and regulation under the Act, the
amendment creates a new exemption allowing firms to target an unlimited number
of "qualified purchasers"-individuals with more than $5 million in investments
or institutions with more than $25 million under management.

As a result, buyout firms soon will be able to raise funds from a larger number
of investors, instead of targeting a few limited partners with deeper pockets
in order to keep its investor list to 100, said Paul Schreiber, a partner and
head of asset management group at Shearman & Sterling, a New York-based law
firm.

"[The 100 investor rule] hasn't been a problem for most fund raisers," said Jay
Applegate, a veteran placement agent now with Brittany Capital Group, "but it
has precluded some funds from taking in smaller pieces because each piece is
still counted as a slot."
Impact on Fund Raisers

Buyout firms raising large funds from a long investor list would appreciate the
flexibility, a G.P. source said. For example, TA Associates' TA/Advent VIII and
Madison Dearborn Capital Partners II, L.P. both had L.P. rosters numbering
close to 100. Still, not all buyout firms will jump at the opportunity due to
the inconvenience that comes with managing an extensive L.P. list.

Placement agents said the amendment likely will have more impact on
funds-of-funds and vehicles targeting individuals and wealthy families, until
now comparatively minor players in the fund-raising scene due to their smaller
commitments. Also, G.P.s who have complained of the slow approval processes of
public pensions can bypass them for a greater number of individual investors,
although public pensions are still crucial to firms raising sizable funds
because of their larger investments.

At its inception in 1940, the Investment Company Act had been criticized for
its broad inclusion of certain pooled assets whose regulation is not justified
for public policy reasons.  Congress at that time created what was called "the
100 investor rule," excluding a fund if it had fewer than 100 beneficial owners
of its securities, and G.P.s have lived with the rule ever since.

The new amendment will take effect within 180 days from the date of the signing
of the Act or when the Securities and Exchange Commission establishes the
necessary rules and definitions, whichever happens earlier, Mr. Schreiber
said.K.T.

Momentum Holds In U.K. Buyout Market

The U.K. buyout market is showing clear signs of overheating, according to the
Centre for Management Buyout Research (CMBOR). The proportion of debt and
mezzanine in funding structures is now at 50%, the highest since 1989, and the
price-to-earning ratio-particularly in larger divestment buyouts-is continuing
to rise.

CMBOR's preliminary analysis of third quarter activity showed volumes down
slightly from the second quarter but significantly greater than in 3Q 1995. In
the last quarter, 140 deals with a value of #1.25 billion ($2.092 billion) were
recorded, an increase of 16% by number and 30% by value over last year's third
quarter (see table below). The third quarter also saw, for the first time, the
value of externally generated transactions exceed that of management buyouts.

Total deal value for the year to date stands at more than $9.3 billion, and
with several completions since the end of the third quarter and other
substantial deals expected to close before year end, CMBOR predicts the total
market value for 1996 could equal the record $12.5 billion chalked up in 1989.

The combination of high prices and the uncertainties in the face of the
forthcoming general election is expected to prompt venture capitalists to adopt
a more cautious approach, but CMBOR predicts that buyouts of privately owned
companies will continue at a relatively high level until the election.
Meanwhile, many transactions are taking a long time to be completed, with
extensive due diligence being undertaken to ensure the high valuations sought
by vendors are realistic.Jennifer Jury

Pantheon Readies European Fund-of-Funds

Pantheon Ventures is adding a European fund-of-funds to its stable. Although
formal marketing has not yet begun, Pantheon director Carol Kennedy said the
firm has lined up  #80 million ($134 million) in interest, and a first closing
is to take place soon.

Pantheon ultimately expects to raise around $250 million for investment in
expansion capital, buyout and mezzanine funds in Western Europe. As much as 10%
of the fund may be put into direct investments although Pantheon does not
intend to target vehicles that offer co-investment rights. The fund also may
take a small number of secondary positions, with due regard to the priority
that Pantheon International Participations, the group's quoted vehicle, has in
this area.

To date, Pantheon has backed approximately 50 European funds. Pantheon  raised
its second U.S. fund-of-funds this year and is planning a second Asian
fund-of-funds for mid-1997; it currently has more than $1 billion under
management in the private equity asset class.J.J.

Cinven Lands $500 Mil. For Debut Buyout Fund

Cinven can count its first third-party fund-raising exercise an unqualified
success: It took the U.K.'s most prolific investor in larger buyouts barely
five months to raise #300 million ($500 million) for The Cinven Fund from some
20 institutions in North America, Continental Europe and the Middle East.
Merrill Lynch was lead placement agent for the Cinven Fund, with Cazenove & Co.
and JO Hambro Magan the co-agents.

The vehicle's original target was $333 million, to be invested  alongside
Cinven's four existing institutional clients; the fund was to make commitments
accounting for 25% of each transaction. The level of investor appetite led
Cinven to up the target to nearly $417 million. Subsequently one of Cinven's
investors, Royal Life Insurance, decided to commit through the fund for
administrative convenience following its merger with Sun Alliance. As a result,
the fund now will invest about 30% of transaction prices alongside investors
British Coal Pension Schemes, Railways Pension Schemes and Barclays Bank
Pension Fund.

The 10-year partnership has a five-year investment period. One of the funds
first investments will be in Newsquest's $508 million acquisition-jointly
funded by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.-of Westminster Press. Jennifer .Jury.

team-comprising Barrie Moore, Tina Sharp and John Sealy-which has joined ABN
AMRO Causeway.

The fund will hold the first of three scheduled closings immediately on $22
million drawn from ABN AMRO and other sources, according to Causeway Managing
Director Lionel Anthony.

The ABN AMRO Causeway Mezzanine Fund was structured to operate independently of
the parent bank and the group's equity funds. "We think joint equity and
mezzanine investment is the wrong approach, since it offers potential for
considerable conflict of interest," Mr. Anthony said.

Given the aggressive lending policies of U.K. banks at present, the group
expects the bulk of the new fund's deal flow to originate in Continental
Europe, although the portfolio ultimately will be evenly split between the U.K.
and the Continent.J.J.

Approaching the New, Hancock Keeps the Old

Despite the pending ownership change and the $750 million-plus domestic
fund-of-funds looming on its horizons, Hancock Venture Partners likely will
maintain a conservative approach to investing, sticking to the tried and true
strategy that has worked for the team since 1978.

Brooks Zug, a co-founder and general partner of the Boston-based firm, says the
new firm, with the same staff of investment professionals, will continue to
manage and invest the assets the team handled as Hancock Venture Partners.

Discussing investment strategy, Mr. Zug says domestic buyouts will continue to
represent between 25% and 30% of Hancock's portfolio. The majority of that
percentage, nearly 60%, will be directed at partnerships and the rest in direct
investments, which has been the case for much of the last five years.

So far, Hancock has raised four domestic fund-of-funds that targeted buyouts,
including the $200 million Hancock Venture Partners III, L.P., raised in 1989,
and Hancock Venture Partners IV, L.P., which raised $353 million in 1994.

This fourth fund-of-funds is fully invested, with partnerships and secondary
interests accounting for $196 million and direct investments another $156
million. The lead investors in the fourth fund included Colorado Public
Employees' Retirement Association and Oregon Public Employees Retirement
System, whose commitments each accounted for between 10% and 20% of the
fund-of-funds.

Some buyout firms Hancock has invested with include Bain Capital, Berkshire
Partners, Charterhouse Group International, J.W. Childs Associates, Golder,
Thoma, Cressey, Rauner, Inc., Vestar Capital Partners and Welsh, Carson,
Anderson & Stowe.

Mr. Zug says the increasing amount of money being directed towards buyout funds
does not make him feel uncomfortable.

Besides establishing itself in the domestic arena, Hancock has carved a niche
in the international private equity business as a fund-of-funds manager.

The firm this year raised $950 million for its second international
fund-of-funds, Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P., which is
40% invested. Mr. Zug says that the fund is on pace to be fully invested in
three years.

The first international fund-of-funds, Hancock International Private Equity
Partners, L.P., raised $250 million in 1991.

Mr. Zug says buyouts account for 51% of Hancock's international investments.
This percentage likely will drop to between 40% and 50% as the fund steps up
its investments in Asia, which is not an investment destination targeted by
many buyout firms.

Mr. Zug says that 85% of the international fund will be invested in
partnerships, with the balance in direct investments. To date, Fund II has
invested $225 million in 11 partnerships, nine secondary vehicles and four
direct deals.

By the time the fund-of-funds is fully invested, Mr. Zug says he expects the
portfolio to comprise between 12 and 15 investments in Europe, 10 to 12
investments in Asia, and six to eight in Latin America, as well as other
investments in emerging markets such as South Africa.

Target investment size for the fund ranges from $25 million to $30 million for
international partnerships and between $2 million and $10 million for direct
investments.

Mr. Zug says that the vehicle also would invest in undiscovered funds that have
not raised much capital in the United States.

International groups with which Hancock has invested include French-based Alpha
Associates and CICLAD SA; U.K.-based Baring Capital Investors, Candover
Investments PLC, Industri Kapital LTD, and Phildrew Ventures; Dowdy-Hanson in
Germany; South Africa-based FirstCorp Capital Investors LTD and South Africa
Capital Growth; the Argentina Private Equity Fund and Italian Private Equity
Fund, Mr. Zug says.

"We directly invest in industries that we understand, and we'd like to have a
strong local venture or buyout firm," he says.
Local Presence Essential

Hancock will only invest internationally with fund managers who fully
understand the nations and locales they are investing in.

"We will not invest in someone who comes into this region from another region,"
Mr. Zug says. "We want someone who can have breakfast with the company boss
once a week."

He said Hancock will consider investing alongside local private equity firms
with which it has not previously partnered. Also, secondary interests in
partnerships will continue as a large part of the overall portfolio.

Mr. Zug says secondary investments represent between 20% and 25% of total
investments, and this trend would continue.

Investors in Hancock's funds include Boeing Co., Deere & Co., Delta Air Lines,
Denver Public School Employees' Pension & Benefit Assoc., Ford Foundation, IBM
Corp., Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System, Massachusetts Pensions
Reserve Investment Management Board, NYNEX Asset Management Co., Orange County
Employees' Retirement System and William & Flora Hewitt Foundation.J.K.

At Press Time Summit Partners Nears Mezzanine Fund Close

Boston-based Summit Partners is set to close by mid-December a second mezzanine
fund that was launched Oct. 31. The closing is expected to round up between
$250 million and $300 million, a source at the firm said.

Summit Partners Subordinated Debt Fund II, L.P. was launched with a target of
at least $250 million. The closing, scheduled for Dec. 17, may be the fund's
final because the amount raised so far already is near its target, the source
added.

The buyout firm closed its first mezzanine fund two years ago, landing a total
of $100 million (BUYOUTS March 21, 1994, p. 3). The first fund was raised to
complement Summit's buyout equity fund by quickening the financing of
acquisitions.

The buyout firm closed its $600 million  Summit Partners IV last year and
currently is investing the equity fund.Tanya Bielski.

ESOP'S (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) have unique tax

ESOP'S (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) have unique tax
characteristics which make them an attractive ownership vehicle
for some firms. ESOP's are IRS approved retirement plans that
require investment in stock of the employer company. Because of
the organizational, tax, and financial complexities surrounding
ESOP's, implementation requires careful study. Since ESOP's
became popular in the mid-1970's, we have worked with firms of
all sizes to determine the advisability of establishing an ESOP.
This includes: Performing feasibility studies to decide whether
an ESOP is workable for a particular client; Determine if an
ESOP is the best alternative to meet the client's needs;
investigate the long term consequences of using an ESOP; explore
ESOP feasibility from every angle so that the implemented plan
will function smoothly and without unforseen liability to the
corporation.  (B)  13170

The best candidates for an ESOP BUYOUT have the following
characteristics: shares held by individual (non-corporate) owners__
non-union employees__good cash flow or borrowing base. Other
considerations: 1.) an ESOP transaction can be completed much more
quickly than a sale to a third party and will therefore increase
the volume of transaction. 2.) your fee can be structured according
to your original agreement or as a participation in fees. Inquire if
you have an acquisition candidate which meets our investment
criteria.  (B)  13169

In conjunction with, and through our Investor Database, we can
provide promising corporations with INVESTOR EQUITY OR DEBT,
ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS OR DIVESTITURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, AND
ANY PREPARATORY FINANCIAL CONSULTANCY. Our primary focus, however,
is providing $1 MM- $10 MM investor equity to firms that show
$5 MM- $75 MM in sales, have at least a three year operating
history, and have solid management in place. Our fees are paid
only upon successful completion of a funded project.  (B)  13137

Company structures transactions between clients seeking to raise
capital through DEBT FINANCING OR THE SALE OF EQUITY. In
addition, we assist companies in the sale, acquisition, merger or
divestment of their assets or entire business. Affiliated with a
finance sourcing group headquartered in New York City. Have a
network and database of funding sources including venture
capitalists, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies
and a limited number of individuals. Fees are competitive with
major financial houses in the major cities in the United States.
All financing fees are payable out of the proceeds of any equity
or debt financing raised. If the funds are not received by the
company, we do not get paid. Our use of contingent fees obviously
means we are successful in a large number of the financings we
undertake. Since the expenses of the offerings are ours until
the financing materializes we are selective as to the companies
we accept as clients.  The minimum financing is $100,000. Startups
are generally acceptable as long as the principals have invested
a reasonable amount of financing in the company as well as "sweat
equity."  (B)  13136

Private Investment firm focused on providing EQUITY AND DEBT CAPITAL
TO GROWTH COMPANIES. Our firm seeks to invest between $500 M and

sort of proprietary feature, whether it is a technology, brand name,
well defined distribution network, or a superior management team. At
the moment, one of our specific interests is manufacturers and
distributors of spare parts for industrial machinery. We look for
meaningful investment positions and input on key issues, i.e. exit
strategy, financings, and other non-operational issues. Most
desirable are opportunities in the Northeast region of the United
States. Finally, we typically avoid high-tech industries and
start-up ventures. In addition to providing funds for growth, our
firm seeks an active role in corporate development and business
strategies through consulting/advisory efforts and Board
representation. Our principals and associates have had considerable
success as entrepreneurs, investors and strategists. Corporations
have found our skills, backgrounds and contacts with Wall Street
to be valuable to their business-building processes.  13050
