<title>Guideline 3 Part 7</title>
</head>
<body>
<H3>VII. GUIDELINE FOR NEW
ANIMAL DRUGS AND FOOD ADDITIVES DERIVED FROM A FERMENTATION</H3><P>
<b>I. Purpose and Applicability</b><P>
The guideline describes how the sponsor of a new animal drug or a food additive
derived from a fermentation can meet the statutory requirement that the sponsor
show the safety of the compound before FDA can approve its use in
food-producing animals. The testing and evaluation criteria described in this
guideline are applicable to a new product that is derived from a fermentation
that produces a drug and that is administered as a complex mixture. FDA is
primarily concerned with new fermentations about which there is little
information on the toxicity from the substances produced by the microorganism.
The products derived from these fermentations may contain toxic components that
are not readily isolated and identified and that might remain as residues in
edible animal products.<P>
Unless new evidence shows a concern for safety from uncharacterized substances,
FDA will not consider these testing and evaluation criteria to be applicable to
an animal drug that is presently being legally administered as a complex
mixture, nor to a feed ingredient that is presently marketed under the
restrictions of FDA Compliance Policy Guide #7126.31. (The feed ingredient is
derived from the production of a regulated antibiotic, but is marketed without
a drug claim; each ton of feed ingredient contains less than two grams of
antibiotic; each ton of finished feed contains less than three pounds of the
feed ingredient.)<P>
FDA also will not routinely consider these testing and evaluation criteria to
be applicable to a new food additive that is derived from a by-product of the
fermentation industry not producing drugs unless evidence shows a concern for
safety due to uncharacterized substances in these products. This latter group
presently includes such products as brewers dried or wet grains or condensed
solubles, distillers dried or condensed solubles, extracted fermentation press
cake or solubles from enzyme or organic acid producers, and yeast harvests from
beer or ale mash.<P>
<b>II. Need for the Guideline</b><P>
FDA, over the years, has approved for use in animal feed a number of
antibiotics that are marketed as unpurified or partially purified products. The
tolerances for most of these products were established from bioassays performed
on the pure antibiotic. This regulatory approach assumes that the antibiotic is
the most toxic substance in the product. FDA no longer considers this
regulatory approach adequate. The drug portion of these products is typically
1-25%, leaving 75-99% of the product uncharacterized. Most of the
uncharacterized portion will be normal constituents of animal cells (e.g.,
carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids, nucleotides, etc.) and is considered
safe. However, the production of toxins by microorganisms is well known (1-4).
The microorganism could produce both a useful product and a harmful toxin. The
quantity of these substances could vary from changes in culture conditions
(e.g. substrate, temperature, pH, rate of aeration) or from changes in the
genetic integrity of the organism. The fermentation could become contaminated
with a competing microorganism that produces a toxin. Finally, toxic components
could be produced or introduced during processing of the material for
marketing.<P>
The criteria and procedures described in the other guidelines in this series
assume that the sponsored product is extensively characterized and that any
component can be readily isolated, identified, and subjected to the testing
described. However, the sponsored products addressed in this guideline are
complex mixtures that may contain the organism, its cellular debris and
metabolic products, and residual substrate and nonsubstrate material. This
guideline provides an acceptable procedure for evaluating the safety of these
products, but alternatives are possible (see 21 CFR 10.90). For example, the
sponsor may choose to characterize the product chemically and to seek approval
after testing those components that raise toxicological concerns.<P>
<b>III. Safety Evaluation of the Sponsored Product</b><P>
The evaluation of the sponsored product under this guideline consists of (1) a
safety evaluation of the purified drug by the currently applied criteria as
described in other guidelines, and (2) a toxicological evaluation of the
uncharacterized portion of the sponsored product as described in this
guideline.<P>
<b>A. Testing of the Uncharacterized Portion</b><P>
The sponsor will normally conduct this testing on the product proposed for
marketing. The product should be derived from at least a pilot factory
fermentation (preferably from a production factory fermentation) and must be
from the same lot or the same pooled lot. Sponsors are encouraged to submit
detailed protocols to FDA for review and comment before initiating the
testing.<P>
The sponsor may select either of the following series of tests:<P>
<b>SERIES 1.</b><P>
* A 180-day feeding study within a rodent species (usually the rat). An
acceptable study will include serial sacrifices at 60 and 120 days. If
necessary to satisfy the sponsor's statutory obligation to show a product's
safety, FDA may require a longer feeding study when evidence indicates a
potential for late occurring toxicity.<P>
* A 90-day feeding study in a non-rodent mammalian species (usually the dog).
If necessary to satisfy the sponsor's statutory obligation to show a product's
safety, FDA may require a longer feeding study when evidence indicates a
potential for late occurring toxicity.<P>
* A 2-generation reproduction study with a teratology component in rats. If
there is an indication of toxicity at lower doses, higher incidences, or
greater intensity in the second generation as compared to the first, then the
study should include a third generation.<P>
*Genetic toxicity tests in the presence and absence of metabolic activation on
the aqueous and organic solvent extractables of the sponsored product and on
the residues occurring in the urine of the food-producing animals (target
animals) fed the sponsored product at the highest practical level. If this
testing shows a positive response. then the sponsor must conduct chronic
bioassays in two rodent species to resolve questions concerning carcinogenicity
and thus to show safety as required by law.<P>
<b>SERIES 2.</b><P>
* Chronic bioassays for oncogenicity in two rodent species.<P>
* A 90-day feeding study in a non-rodent mammalian species (usually the dog).
If necessary to satisfy the sponsor's statutory obligation to show a product's
safety, FDA may require a longer feeding study when evidence indicates a
potential for late occurring toxicity.<P>
* A 2-generation reproduction study with a teratology component In rats. If
there is an indication of toxicity at lower doses, higher incidences, or
greater intensity in the second generation as compared to the first, than the
study should include a third generation.<P>
In the feeding studies, the sponsor should use a dose high enough to provide
information on the potential for toxicity from the uncharacterized components
in the sponsored product. FDA will consider this condition satisfied if the
highest of several doses used gives a response from the purified drug or if the
sponsored product comprises 10% of the total diet and no toxicity is observed.
FDA believes that the sponsored product needs to be fed at a dietary
concentration greater than the 5% limit for non-nutritive substances
recommended by the National Cancer Institute (5) because many components of the
sponsored product will be nutritive; however, FDA is not suggesting that the
sponsored product be fed at the 20% limit, recommended for nutritive
substances, to reduce the probability that a toxic response will be observed
due to nutritional or salt imbalances. The usual 90-day study is extended to
180-days and the serial sacrifices are included to increase the sensitivity of
the assay.<P>
The sponsor may choose to use genetic toxicity tests to assess the presence of
or the formation of potentially carcinogenic residues from the uncharacterized
components in the sponsored product. The results of these tests do not provide
direct evidence of carcinogenicity, but the tests are useful because of the
high correlation shown between a compound's ability to cause adverse data in
genetic toxicity tests and its ability to cause cancer in animals. The tests
recommended are discussed in the GUIDELINE FOR THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT. FDA will
make a regulatory decision from a collective evaluation of these data, and not
from the result of a single assay.<P>
FDA would prefer that the sponsor conduct separate genetic toxicity tests on
each residue that is present in the edible tissue of the target animals. This
testing is clearly not feasible for these sponsored products. Individually
testing the extractables of the sponsored product and the residues in the urine
of target animals provide the most feasible and direct testing of the residues
that people will consume. Mutagens have been detected by testing residues in
urine (6-11). If there are technical reasons preventing the testing of the
extractables or the urine sample, the sponsor must conduct chronic bioassays in
two rodent species (Series 2) to assess the carcinogenic potential of the
sponsored product and thus to show safety as required by law.<P>
A suggested general procedure for preparation of the extractables is:<P>
<b>STEP 1. </b>Extract an homogenized sample of the sponsored product with an
aqueous solvent (an excess of water, or preferably, a water-menthol mixture).
Remove insoluble material by filtration or centrifugation. Remove the solvent
by evaporation under reduced pressure.<P>
<b>STEP 2. </b>Extract the residual solids from the aqueous extraction with an
appropriate organic solvent such as ethyl acetate. Remove the insoluble
material by filtration or centrifugation. Remove the solvent by evaporation
under reduced pressure.<P>
<b>STEP 3. </b>Dissolve a known amount of the residue in a minimum volume of a
solvent that is compatible with the test system. Sterilize each solution
(filter sterilization is recommended).<P>
A suggested general procedure for sample preparation from urine is:<P>
<b>Step 1.</b> Collect 24-hour urine samples from at least three animals per
sex before feeding the sponsored product. The pooled sample is the negative
control; the positive control is this urine sample plus a substance known to
give a positive response.<P>
<b>STEP 2. </b>Feed the sponsored product to the animals for two weeks at a
dose higher than the proposed dose of the product, but at a dose lower than
that which induces toxicity. In order to avoid false positives, care should be
taken to assure that the only dietary variable is the sponsored product.<P>
<b>Step 3.</b> Collect 24-hour urine samples from the dosed animals. Treat the
pooled sample with enzymes such as beta-glucuronidase and aryl sulfatase to
release conjugated substances. Evaporate the sample to dryness under reduced
pressure.<P>
<b>Step 4.</b> Dissolve a known amount of the residue in a minimum volume of a
solvent that is compatible with the test system and sterilize the solution
(filter sterilization is recommended).<P>
<b>B. Evaluation of Results</b><P>
FDA will determine from comparing the results of testing the purified drug and
the product proposed for marketing whether all the toxicity is attributable to
the purified drug. If FDA concludes that the data do not demonstrate any
additional toxicity from the uncharacterized portion, FDA will use the results
of the testing conducted on the purified drug to establish the ADI.<P>
If FDA concludes that the data demonstrate additional toxicity from the
uncharacterized portion of the sponsored product, FDA may use the results of
this testing to establish the ADI. For example, assume that the no-observed
effect level when the purified drug was tested was established at a dose of 400
ppm. Assume also that when the product proposed for marketing was tested, the
no--observed effect level was established when the dose of the drug was 100
ppm. This result would suggest that another toxic substance was present in the
uncharacterized portion. In this specific case, FDA will calculate the ADI
using the residues of the drug as the marker for the other toxic substance and
using the 100 ppm dose. The ADI for the total residue of the drug would be 0.1
ppm if 90-day studies were conducted (100 ppm divided by the 1000-fold safety
factor), or 1 ppm if chronic studies were conducted (100 ppm divided by the
100-fold safety factor). When this approach is used, FDA will implement the
statutory requirement that the sponsor develop a regulatory assay for residues
of the drug when necessary to ensure compliance with any restrictions on the
product's use.<P>
The above approach will not be acceptable for a carcinogen. In such a case, the
sponsor has the following options for developing a safe product:<P>
* Purify the drug and discard the remainder of the fermentation, or<P>
* Reformulate the product to reduce 'the concentration of the toxicant(s)
relative to the drug and demonstrate that the reformulated product is safe
according to criteria in this guideline, or<P>
* Identify the toxicant(s), and demonstrate by adequate tests on the
toxicant(s) that safe conditions of use can be established for the product
containing the toxicant. FDA may require the sponsor to develop a regulatory
assay for the toxicant(s) to satisfy the statutory requirement of a showing of
safety.<P>
<b>C. Quality Control</b><P>
The sponsor must submit a description of the product, and a description of the
methods and controls used in its manufacture to determine and preserve
identity, strength, and quality (21 CFR 514.1(b)(4) and (5)). FDA will review
these data as part of the human food safety evaluation to determine the
adequacy of these procedures to prevent the formation of toxic components that
were not subjected to the pre-clearance testing. The sponsor must follow the
procedures and controls described unless a supplemental new animal drug
application has been approved (21 CFR 514.8). A sponsor seeking approval under
the terms of this guideline must also provides<P>
* A description of the microbiological culture techniques used from stock
culture through fermentation so that an assessment can be made of the potential
for contamination, and a description of the tests used to<P>
* A description-of the procedures used to control the genetic integrity of the
inoculum, and a description of the tests used to assure that the integrity is
maintained.<P>
* A description of the substrate used for the fermentation, including a listing
of the maximum allowable variations in substrate composition.<P>
* A description of the tests used to determine drug yield in a batch, and the
criteria used for accepting batches that deviate from the expected yield.<P>
If the results of the tests and controls do not meet the specifications in the
NADA, no product from the batch can be marketed for new animal drug or food
additive purposes. Production records must be maintained (21 CFR 226.102).<P>
As s condition of approval FDA may require that the sponsor use a test for gene
mutations in bacteria in the quality control procedures if other tests and
controls are judged inadequate to preserve the identity, strength, and quality
of the sponsored product. This decision will be made on a case-by-case basis
after review of the submitted data.<P>

<h3>  IV. GUIDELINE FOR ESTABLISHING A SAFE CONCENTRATION  </h3>
<P>
<b>A. CALCULATING THE ACCEPTABLE DAILY INTAKE (ADI)</b><P>
As described in guideline II, the toxicology tests are designed to determine
the dose at which the compound produces an adverse effect and a dose which
produces no observed effect (NOEL). If the drug is not a carcinogen, the NOEL
of the most sensitive effect in the most sensitive species divided by a safety
factor is used to determine an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for drug residues.
If the sponsor provides strong scientific data that this NOEL is not predictive
of human toxicity, the FDA will use a more appropriate NOEL for establishing
the ADI. Therefore, the ADI is calculated by dividing the NOEL obtained in the
toxicology study with the most appropriate species by a safety factor.<P>
<b>B. CONSUMPTION VALUES</b><P>
FDA assumes that an individual eats more edible muscle than organ tissue. FDA
accounts for this difference in consumption when calculating the safe
concentration for drug residues. The consumption values (grams consumed) for
edible muscle and organ tissue are described in Table 1. These consumption
values will be applied across all species, because it is assumed that when an
individual consumes a full portion of a meat product from one species, they
will not consume a full portion of a meat product from another species.<P><pre>
Table 1: Consumption Values

Edible Product                      Grams Consumed
Muscle                                  300
Liver                                   100
Kidney                                   50
Fat                                      50
</pre>
<p>
The Center will continue to regulate milk and eggs as independent commodities,
that is, these products are consumed in addition to the   consumption of the
edible muscle or organ tissues. FDA assumes that on a daily basis a person
consumes a full portion of milk in addition to the full portion edible muscle
or organ tissue. The intake estimate for milk is 1.5 L. For eggs, the intake
estimate will be changed to 100 g. Again, the FDA assumes that on a daily basis
a person consumes a full portion of eggs in addition  to the consumption of
muscle or organ tissue.<P>
<b>C. ESTABLISHING THE SAFE CONCENTRATION</b><P>
FDA will calculate the safe concentration for each edible tissue using the
acceptable daily intake (ADI), the weight in kg of an average adult (60 kg),
and the amount of the product eaten per day in grams.
<P>
<pre>
                                        ADI (&#181;g/kg/day) x 60 kg 
safe concentration =                   ________________________  
(ppm)                                     grams consumed/day.
</pre>
<P>
For
products approved in lactating dairy cows, and for products approved in
lactating dairy cows and other meat-producing species; a part of the ADI
(generally one-half) will be reserved for milk. The safe concentration for milk
equals the ADI reserved for milk (&#181;g/kg/day) times 60 kg divided by 1500
ml/day. The remaining part of the ADI will be partitioned among the animals
tissues as described above. For products approved in both laying hens and other
animals, a part of the ADI (usually one-fifth) will be reserved for eggs. The
safe concentration for eggs equals the ADI reserved for eggs (&#181;g/kg/day) times
60 kg divided by 100 g/day.<P>
FDA will apply these consumption values to determine the safe concentration in
organ tissue for most new animal drug products. Based on an appropriate
scientific justification, alternate consumption values may be used for
calculating the safe concentration. FDA will establish a lower safe
concentration than that calculated from the toxicological data, if the
calculated safe concentration is higher than that needed to support the
intended use in target animals (see 21 CFR 556.1(b)).<P>

<H3>II. GUIDELINE FOR TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING</H3><P>
<B>A. INTRODUCTION</B><P>
For compounds used in food-producing animals, FDA is concerned with
intermittent and chronic exposure of people to relatively low concentrations of
residues. FDA tailors the type of toxicological testing 
needed for a showing of safety for a specific compound by considering its
proposed use in animal husbandry, the probable exposure of people to the parent
compound and its metabolites (residues) under its conditions of use, their
possible biological effects as deduced by structure-activity relationships, and
their effects as observed in biological systems. Some compounds need only a
minimum of testing; others may need very extensive studies in a number of
diverse biological systems.<P>
The purpose of the toxicological studies is to define the biological effect(s)
of the sponsored compound and its quantitative limits. FDA normally asks for
testing of the sponsored compound. FDA may also ask for separate testing of a
metabolite when such testing is necessary to define adequately the biological
effect of the sponsored compound (see GUIDELINE FOR METABOLISM STUDIES AND FOR
SELECTION OF RESIDUES FOR TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING). FDA generally asks that the
sponsor, at a minimum, determine a dose of the compound that produces an
adverse biological effect in test animals and a dose that does not produce any
significant toxicological or pharmacological effect (the no-observed-effect
level). The spacing of the doses should provide an assessment of the
dose-response relationship.<P>
<B>B. TESTING GENERALLY NEEDED FOR SPONSORED COMPOUNDS</B><P>
FDA generally believes that the following studies are necessary for each
sponsored compound:<P>
<ul>
<li> A battery of genetic toxicity tests as described in the GUIDELINE FOR
THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT.<P>
<li> A 90-day feeding study both in a rodent species (usually the rat) and in a
non-rodent mammalian species (usually the dog). <P>
<li> A two-generation reproduction study with a teratology component in rats. Two
litters should be produced in each generation. If toxicity occurs at a lower
dose, with a higher incidence, or with greater intensity in the second
generation as compared to the first, then the study should include a third
generation.<P>
</ul>

FDA may ask for additional studies as follows:<P>
<ul><li> Chronic bioassays for oncogenicity in each of two rodent species when
indicated by the criteria described in the GUIDELINE FOR THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT.
The sponsor should conduct the study in rats using a protocol that, in addition
to potential oncogenicity will also evaluate chronic toxicity.<P>
<li> A one year feeding study in a rodent species (usually the rat) and in a
non-rodent species (usually the dog) when the exposure of people to residues
exceeds 25 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day (equivalent to a concentration
of 1 part per million in the total diet of people, assuming a 60 kilogram body
weight and a total solid diet of 1500 grams), or when evidence indicates that
the residues bioaccumulate in the tissues of target animals. FDA will calculate
exposure as described in GUIDELINE FOR ESTABLISHING A TOLERANCE.<P>
<li> A teratology study in a second species when the compound is structurally
related to a known teratogen, when the compound has hormonal activity that may
affect the fetus, or when the compound shows adverse effects in the
reproduction/teratology study indicating that the compound may be a
teratogen.<P>
<li> Other specialized testing if necessary to define adequately the biological
effect of the compound. FDA will base this decision on the results of the above
studies and any other information available on the compound. Examples of
specialized studies include testing for neurotoxicity, for immunotoxicity, for
hormonal activity, for toxicity following <i>in utero</i> exposure, or for
toxicity from "biomass" products (see GUIDELINE FOR NEW ANIMAL DRUGS AND FOOD
ADDITIVES DERIVED FROM A FERMENTATION).
</ul><P>
FDA has provided information on acceptable protocols for subchronic, chronic,
reproduction, and teratology studies in TOXICOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE SAFETY
ASSESSMENT OF DIRECT FOOD ADDITIVES (The "Redbook"). See 47 FR 46141, October
15, 1982. The sponsor is urged to consult with FDA before designing protocols
for specialized studies not described in that document.<P>
If the testing shows that the sponsored compound is a carcinogen,. FDA will
apply the "no-residue" requirement of section 409(c)(3)(A), 512(d)(1)(H), or
706(b)(5)(B) of the act as operationally defined in 21 CFR subpart E of Part
500. FDA will calculate the concentration of residue giving no significant risk
of cancer, S(O), from the tumor data using a statistical extrapolation
procedure. Because the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not sufficiently
understood, none of the mathematical procedures for extrapolation has a fully
adequate biological rationale. In the absence of information establishing the
mechanism of carcinogenesis for a particular chemical, FDA will use a
non-threshold, linear-at-low dose extrapolation procedure that determines the
upper limit of the risk. FDA will use the linear interpolation procedure of
Gaylor and Kodell (D. W. Gaylor and R. L. Kodell, 'Linear Interpolation
Algorithm for Low Dose Risk Assessment of Toxic Substances,<sup>" </sup>Journal
of Environmental Pathology and Toxicology, 4:305-312, 1980) as modified by
Farmer, Kodell, and Gaylor (J. H. Farmer, R. L. Kodell, and D. W. Gaylor,
"Estimation and Extrapolation of Tumor Probabilities from a Mouse Bioassay with
Survival/Sacrifice Components," Risk Analysis, 2:27-34, 1982). In the
extrapolation FDA will use the upper 95 percent confidence limit on the tumor
data and a permitted maximum lifetime risk to the test animal of 1 in 1
million.<P>
FDA will use an alternative procedure if the sponsor presents sufficient
appropriate information to demonstrate that a different extrapolation procedure
is more appropriate. <P>
For other toxicological endpoints, FDA will calculate the acceptable daily
intake (ADI) from the results of the most sensitive study in the most sensitive
species. From that study the ADI is the highest dose showing no-observed-effect
divided by the appropriate safety factor. FDA will normally use the safety
factors indicated below.<P>
<pre>
   Type of Study                            Safety Factor 
 
   Chronic                                      100 
   Reproduction/Teratology                      100 or 1000 
   (100 for a clear indication of maternal
   toxicity, 1000 for other effects)  
   90-Day                                       1000
         
         </pre><P>
<B>C. TESTING NEEDED FOR SEX STEROIDS</B><P>
The studies needed for a showing of safety for a sex steroid, considering both
carcinogenicity and the other toxicological endpoints associated with these
compounds, are described below.<P>
Although not all sex steroids are demonstrated carcinogens, the evidence
supports FDA's conclusion that all endogenous sex steroids and synthetic
compounds with similar biological activity should be regarded as suspect
carcinogens. FDA has also concluded that the endogenous sex steroids that have
been adequately tested are not genotoxic agents. Therefore, if any of these
compounds gives an oncogenic response in experimental animals, its mechanism of
action is not related to a direct chemical interaction with DNA, but tumor
development is a consequence of hyperproliferation of endocrine sensitive
tissue resulting from persistent overstimulation of the hormonal system. FDA
has concluded that in the absence of the persistent overstimulation of the
hormonal system from residues remaining in the tissues of treated animals,
individuals will not be subject to an increased risk of cancer.<P>
<B>1. Endogenous Sex Steroids</B><P>
FDA has concluded that for the endogenous sex steroids and their simple ester
derivatives safety can be assured without the need for additional animal data.
Because the compounds are endogenous in people and in food-producing animals,
the individual is exposed to rather large quantities of these compound by <i>de
novo</i> synthesis and to much lesser quantities from unmedicated
food-producing animals. FDA has concluded that no physiological effect will
occur in individuals chronically ingesting animal tissues that contain an
increase of endogenous steroid equal to 1% or less of the amount in micrograms
produced by daily synthesis in the segment of the population with the lowest
daily production. That this 1% value represents a safe increased exposure is
supported by scientific information. FDA believes that the 1% value is
reasonable and reflects sound public health policy. In the case of estradiol
and progesterone, prepubertal boys synthesize the least; in the case of
testosterone, prepubertal girls synthesize the least. The daily production
values and the calculated increase permitted above the amount naturally present
in untreated target animals are listed below.<P>
<pre>
              Daily Production        Permitted Increased Exposure 
                (micrograms)                  (micrograms)
      
Estradiol           6                          0.06 
Progesterone      150                          1.50 
Testosterone       32                          0.32
</pre><P>
When a sponsor can demonstrate with a suitable assay that under the proposed
conditions of use the concentration of residue of the endogenous sex steroid in
treated food-producing animals is such that the actual increase in exposure of
people will not exceed the permitted increase, then the compound is shown to be
safe within the meaning of the act.<P>
<B>2. Synthetic Sex Steroids</B><P>
FDA has concluded that animal testing is necessary for establishing the safety
of a synthetic sex steroid. FDA recommends the tests listed below.<P>
<ul>
<li>A battery of three genetic toxicity tests as described in the GUIDELINE FOR
THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT<P>
<li>A two-generation reproduction study with a teratology component in rats. Two
litters should be produced in each generation. If toxicity occurs at a lower
dose, with a higher incidence, or with greater intensity in the second
generation as compared to the first, then the study should include a third
generation. <P>
<li> A teratology study in a second species.<P>
<li>A 90-day feeding study in rats.<P>
<li>A 90-day feeding study in dogs.<P>
<li>A 180-day study in rhesus monkeys or other suitable subhuman primates. The
study should include a 90-day observation period before the 90-day dosing
period. The study should establish a dose that gives no observed hormonal
response. The study should assess the effect of the sponsored compound on
ovulation, the duration of the menstrual cycle, and changes in the
concentration in the blood of the gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone, LH, and
follicle stimulating hormone, FSH) and of the endogenous sex steroids
(estradiol, estrone, and progesterone). In most cases FDA expects that this
will be the most sensitive study.
</ul><P>
FDA will require chronic bioassays for oncogenicity in two rodent species if
either the genetic toxicity tests are positive, or data from the other
bioassays indicates a preneoplastic lesion in other than an endocrine sensitive
tissue.<P>
In the absence of a carcinogenic response or if tumors are observed only in
endocrine sensitive tissue, FDA will calculate the acceptable daily intake
(ADI) from the results of the most sensitive study in the most sensitive
species. FDA will normally use the safety factors indicated in the table in
section B above. FDA will also normally use a safety factor of 100 for the
study in subhuman primates.<P>
If a carcinogenic response is observed in a nonendocrine-sensitive tissue, FDA
will determine the dose that will satisfy the "no-residue" requirement of the
act using the tumor data from that tissue and a statistical extrapolation
procedure.<P><hr>

<H3>VIII.  GUIDELINE FOR THE HUMAN FOOD SAFETY EVALUATION OF BOUND RESIDUES DERIVED
FROM CARCINOGENIC NEW ANIMAL DRUGS</H3><P>
<b>A. INTRODUCTION</b><P>
In I. GUIDELINE FOR METABOLISM STUDIES AND FOR SELECTION OF RESIDUES FOR
TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING, FDA discussed in general terms some considerations
relevant to bound residues. FDA stated that the covalently bound residue,
whether derived from a carcinogenic or noncarcinogenic drug, would be
considered no more toxic than the parent drug; that full structural
identification of the bound residue would normally not be required; and that if
the total residue is below the safe concentration at the requested withdrawal
period no additional safety data would be required on the bound residue. In
addition, FDA specified an acceptable procedure for discounting from the total
residue a portion of the bound residue derived from a non-carcinogenic new
animal drug (i.e., the Gallo-Torres technique for determining bioavailability, Ref. 1).<P>
The human food safety assessment of bound residues derived from carcinogenic
veterinary drugs has long presented FDA with both scientific and policy
challenges. The complex nature of bound residues, which result primarily from
the reaction of a drug metabolite with cellular macromolecules, makes the usual
approaches to a safety evaluation unsuitable. In this guideline FDA describes
the kinds of data it intends to consider in evaluating the toxicological
significance of bound residues derived from carcinogenic animal drugs.<P>
<b>B. NATURE OF THE PROBLEM</b><P>
The use of veterinary drugs in food-producing animals can result in residues
that are not readily extractable from tissues using mild aqueous or organic
extraction conditions. These residues usually represent (a) endogenous
compounds derived from a portion of the drug or (b) covalently bound residues
derived by reaction between a metabolite of the drug and cellular
macromolecules. Those nonextractable residues shown to result from
incorporation of fragments of a drug into naturally occurring molecules (for
example, amino acids, fatty acids, nucleic acids) will be subtracted from the
total residue because they are not of toxicological significance. Bound
residues formed from pathway (b) above will be considered to be of equal
toxicological concern as parent drug until sufficient information is made
available that permits an assessment of the contribution of the bound residue
to the overall toxicity of the drug.<P>
The most direct route to examining the carcinogenic potential of a bound
residue derived from a carcinogenic drug would be to feed test animals tissues
containing the bound residue. The major drawback to this approach is the
limited concentrations of bound residue in the tissues. Even when the tissues
containing the bound residue are used as the only dietary source in order to
reach the highest concentration possible, the total concentration of the bound
residue given to rats or mice is still orders of magnitude lower than the
lowest concentration of the parent compound that would give a positive
carcinogenic response. Thus, it could be argued that negative results are
inconclusive since the animals are not exposed to high enough concentrations of
bound residue.<P>
As noted above, if a veterinary drug is not carcinogenic, FDA discounts from
toxicological concern that portion of the covalently bound residue that is
demonstrated not to be bioavailable, relative to the parent, in the
bile-cannulated rat (Ref. 1). However, FDA has not permitted a similar discount
for bound residue derived from carcinogenic drugs solely on the basis of
bioavailability data because of its concerns for gastrointestinal binding and
gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.<P>
Contributing to the difficulties in making a safety assessment on bound
residues is the fact that the residue chemistry of bound residues is extremely
complex. Reactive metabolic intermediates can form adducts with numerous
naturally occurring compounds, yielding a myriad of products, most of which are
likely to be present in extremely low concentrations. Consequently, the
structural determination of the bound residue is difficult, if not impossible
in most cases. In addition, although it has allowed that that portion of the
bound residue shown to be owing to endogenous incorporation can be discounted
from the total residue of toxicological concern, FDA is aware that such
incorporation is likely to be so widespread as to make an accurate quantitation
virtually impossible.<P>
<b>C. APPROACH TO THE ASSESSMENT OF THE BOUND RESIDUE</b><P>
In proposing an approach to the safety assessment of bound residues that is
thought to be both scientifically valid and reasonably capable of being
accomplished, FDA is making a number of assumptions. First, FDA intends to
consider only the key toxicity target of the parent, i.e., carcinogenicity.
Second, FDA intends to ask that sponsors pursue a toxicological evaluation of
the major adduct(s) only. Third, FDA intends to rely on data from a suitable
combination of <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo </i>studies, rather than from
long term feeding studies, to establish the carcinogenic potential of the bound
residue.<P>
FDA recommends that sponsors wishing to obtain a safety evaluation of the bound
residue derived from a carcinogenic veterinary drug develop data in four areas.
The data should specifically provide information on the:<P>
* Bioavailability of the Bound Residue, <br>
* Toxicological Potential of the Bound Residue, <br>
* Reversibility of Adduct Formation,<br>
* Mechanism of Bound Residue Formation.<P>
The above information may be collected from a combination of <i>in vitro
</i>and <i>in vivo </i>testing methods. Below, FDA briefly describes how these
data, taken together, can be useful in the evaluation process.<P>
<b>Bioavailability of the Bound Residue</b><P>
Generally speaking, if the bound residue is not appreciably absorbed, then its
toxicological significance is diminished. Accordingly, FDA's policy has been to
use data from bioavailability studies in the bile-cannulated rat to reduce the
total residue of toxicological concern when the parent drug is not
carcinogenic. However, because of concerns about gastrointestinal binding and
gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, FDA has not accepted the results of
bioavailability studies to reduce the total residue of carcinogenic concern.
FDA has modified that policy and now intends to rely primarily on the results
of chronic studies to determine the likelihood of a drug or its metabolites,
whether actually identified or only proposed, to produce gastrointestinal
carcinogenesis. Consequently, FDA accepts data from bioavailability
experiments, together with the information in the areas described below, in
assessing the safety of bound residues derived from carcinogenic drugs. In the
event chronic feeding studies show that the gastrointestinal tract is a target
for a drug's carcinogenicity, then FDA may require specific studies to evaluate
the bound residue(s) of the drug.<P>
<b>Toxicological Potential of the Bound Residue</b><P>
Clearly, the goal of the entire testing scheme is to permit a reasonably
reliable assessment of the bound residue's toxicological potential for
carcinogenesis. The information obtained on the reversibility of adduct
formation and mechanism of bound residue formation will contribute to that
evaluation. However, the intrinsic toxicity of the bound residue must still be
assessed. FDA intends to accept <i>in vitro </i>or short-term <i>in vivo
</i>tests to support that assessment.<P>
The specific <i>in vitro </i>or short-term <i>in vivo </i>experiments that a
sponsor chooses to conduct should be based on the toxicity profile of the
parent and the nature of the bound residue. If the parent is carcinogenic and
mutagenic, an assessment of the bound residue may be made using a suitable
mutagenicity assay and appropriate material for testing. Types of material that
could be tested include: bound residue, if isolable: material, either purified
or as a mixture derived from the acid and enzymic treatment to stimulate GI
digestion of bound residue; purified major adducts; beta-lyase treated adducts;
or model compounds, such as cysteine-metabolite or glutathione-metabolite
adducts.<P>
<b>Reversibility of Adduct Formation</b><P>
Because bound residues are derived from reactive metabolites, the reversibility
of adduct formation to yield reactive compounds is a key factor in the safety
assessment of bound residues. A demonstration that the reactive metabolite
cannot be regenerated under various conditions, such as mild acid or enzymic
digestion, would lessen the concern for the toxicological significance of the
bound residue.<P>
While the reactive metabolite could be responsible for toxicity, it must be
realized that bound residues may express toxicity in other ways. For example,
the macromolecule to which the metabolite is bound may undergo digestion to
peptide or amino acid adducts (cysteine adducts, for example) which themselves
may be toxic or which may be chemically or enzymatically transformed into an
active species thereby eliciting toxicity. Appropriate safety testing should
follow from the knowledge gained in the mechanistic studies suggested below.<P>
<b>Mechanism of Bound Residue Formation</b><P>
Studies on the mechanism of bound residue formation provide valuable
information on the probable metabolic pathways involved in drug activation and
on the nature of the bound residue. The data from these studies, which
ordinarily use rat liver microsomes but which could use food-animal liver
microsomes as well, can permit a determination of the binding requirements.
Moreover, the information obtained may allow a prediction as to what adducts
are likely to represent major and minor contributors to the total bound
residue. For example, from <i>in vitro </i>competitive binding studies it may
be possible to determine whether primary binding of a drug metabolite is with
proteins or nucleic acids. Additionally, similar studies with model compounds
including amino acids, nucleosides or small peptides such as glutathione, may
afford important structural information on the bound residue, e.g., to which
amino acid on a protein the drug metabolite is likely to become attached and
which functional groups on the drug metabolite and amino acid are involved in
the binding.<P>
As part of this work FDA may request that the sponsor attempt to demonstrate
that bound residue/adducts observed in the <i>in vitro </i>experiments are
present as well in the target food-animal. It is likely that such work would
entail no more than a qualitative comparative characterization. The need for
this type of work will depend upon the particular drug and decisions will
therefore be made on a case-by-case basis.<P>
<b>D. Conclusions/Comments</b><P>
FDA has outlined an approach to the safety assessment of bound residues derived
from carcinogenic animal drugs. FDA has not enumerated specific studies,
because it anticipates that the particular testing package will vary depending
on the drug and the nature of the bound residue. Moreover, the extent of the
data collection will depend on a number of factors such as the degree of
bioavailability, the amount of bound residue that must be discounted, the
nature of the bound residue, and the carcinogenic and mutagenic potency of the
parent. For example, if a bound residue is poorly absorbed, it is likely that
the quantity of work needed to address the carcinogenic potency of the bound
residue will be reduced. Thus, drugs will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.<P>
FDA suggests that a sponsor wishing to evaluate the safety of a bound residue
derived from a carcinogenic drug develop its testing scheme using the general
approach outlined herein. FDA will then meet with the sponsor to discuss the
proposed scheme and the likelihood that the work will meet the sponsor's
needs.<P>
FDA has written this guideline after considering the views of numerous
scientists that were expressed at the International Symposium on Biological
Models to Determine the Safety of Bound Residues in the Tissues of
Food-producing Animals, held in Washington, D.C., October 1988. In particular,
FDA has relied upon the paper entitled "Development of a Unified Approach to
Evaluate the Toxicological Potential of Bound Residues", which was presented by
Dr. A. Y. H. Lu (Ref. 2). Sponsors are directed to this paper for an excellent
overview of the bound residue issue. In addition, FDA suggests that sponsors
considering addressing the safety of the bound residue of their own drugs refer
to the paper entitled "Toxicological Significance of Covalently Bound Drug
Residues" (Ref. 3). This latter paper and references therein describe the
extensive work that was conducted in attempting to elucidate the toxicological
potential of the bound residue of ronidazole.<P>

<H3>VI. GUIDELINE FOR 
ESTABLISHING A WITHDRAWAL PERIOD</H3><P>
<b>A. INTRODUCTION</b><P>
The withdrawal period or the milk discard time is the interval between the time
of the last administration of a sponsored compound and the time when the animal
can be safely slaughtered for food or the milk can be safely consumed. (For
convenience this guideline will use the "withdrawal period" to refer to both
the withdrawal period and the milk discard time.) The recommended withdrawal
period, if followed, should (1) provide a high degree of assurance to the
producer that his animals or milk will be in compliance with applicable
regulations, (2) be compatible with livestock management practices, and (3) be
reasonably certain to be followed. If the producer follows the recommended
withdrawal period, the consumer has a high degree of assurance that the edible
products from treated animals are safe.<P>
This guideline describes a procedure for establishing a withdrawal period that
is based on a statistical tolerance limit procedure (Ref. 1). The withdrawal
period is determined when the tolerance limit on the residue concentration is
at or below the permitted concentration. A tolerance limit provides an interval
within which a given percentile of the population lies, with a given confidence
that the interval does contain that percentile of the population. FDA will use
the 99th percentile of the population and the 95 percent confidence level.<P>
If the calculated withdrawal period is a fraction of a day or milking, FDA will
establish the withdrawal period as the next day or milking. The sponsor can
obtain information-from the Center for Veterinary Medicine on the maximum
withdrawal period that is generally considered practical for a specific drug
use. If the sponsor proposes a withdrawal period that exceeds the general
limit, the sponsor should submit information to justify that the proposed
withdrawal period will be followed and will not jeopardize the safe and
effective use of the drug.<P>
<b>B. OBTAINING THE RESIDUE DATA</b><P>
The sponsor will obtain residue data from animals as a function of time after
the last treatment with the compound. The sponsor should design the study so
that the last phase of the depletion curve closest to the established tolerance
can be used to calculate the tolerance limit. For the residue study in tissue,
sufficient data are generally provided from residue data from the target tissue
of 20 animals with five animals being slaughtered at each of four evenly
distributed time points. For the residue study in milk, we believe sufficient
data will be provided by 20 animals with milk collected from all animals at
evenly spaced time points. FDA requires that the sponsor collect the residue
data with the same assay that will be submitted for validation. For milk, the
sponsor should conduct triplicate assays for each data point beginning with a
separate milk sample. If more than a single value is used for the residue data
in tissue, the procedure in Appendix A should be modified to account for the
reduced variation of the residue data points due to multiple assays. <br>
Animals used in field trials provide the best source of residue data because
these animals are representative of the proposed target population. Failing
that, the sponsor should design an experiment that simulates the conditions of
use for the drug paying particular attention to the proposed dosing regimen,
normal husbandry conditions, animal gender, and animal maturity. Animals
treated in the studies and/or their milk may be marketable if protocols have
been accepted by FDA.<P>
<b>C. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE RESIDUE DATA</b><P>
The assumptions for the statistical analysis are that during the phase of the
depletion closest to the established tolerance the measurements on the animals
are independent from each other; the residue assays are independent from each
other and from the animal in question; the depletion of the Ln concentration of
residue is linear with time; and the measured Ln concentrations of residue are
distributed normally and have a constant variation over time. For a residue
study in tissues, one straight line is fit to all suitable data by the method
of least-squares (Ref. 2). For a residue study in milk, straight lines are fit
to the data of each animal separately. The withdrawal period is then
established from these lines. Sample calculations are provided in the attached
Appendix A for data from residue study in tissue and in Appendix B for data
from a residue study in milk.<P>
In contrast to the carcasses which are individually sampled by USDA in the
residue monitoring program, milk from an entire dairy herd is pooled in the
bulk tank before sampling in a compliance program. Therefore, the
statistical procedure for calculating the milk discard time must contain a term
for the number of cows contributing milk to the bulk tank. To approximate the
size of a small dairy operation, FDA will use 10 for that value. In a situation
where an individual cow is treated for mastitis, FDA will assume that at a
maximum one-third of the milk in the bulk tank would come from treated cows. In
a situation where an entire dairy herd is treated, such as with an
anthelmintic, FDA will not allow that correction.<P>

Residue Data from Tissue<P>
The results of a depletion study constructed from data involving 25 animals are
listed below. Tissue samples were taken from five animals at each of the five
slaughter times and analyzed for residues. The sponsor validated the analytical
method for the compound to a concentration of 4.5 ppb although the lower limit
of detection was 0.9 ppb. The permitted concentration for the marker residue

1. Regression Analysis<P>
<b>Step 1. </b>Determine which time points fall on the linear part of the
depletion curve for the phase of the curve closest to the R(M)<P>
Generally plotting the data on semi-logarithmic paper, time versus
concentration, is helpful in detecting points that do not fall on the linear
part of the curve. It is not uncommon for points very close to the zero time
point to be inappropriate because they may be from a different phase of the
depletion curve. The other area where points often must be excluded is when all
or most of the measurements are below the limit of measurement. In the example
here, the assay method is validated to one concentration but appears to have a
lower acceptable limit of detection. The one value at 14 days of 3.6 ppb is
below the validated limit of 4.5 ppb but was kept because it was above the
lower limit of detection of 0.9 ppb.<P>
Often the decision to keep values is not so clear. Generally values that are
indicated as "not detectable", or zero, or "less than the limit of detection"
are excluded because they are likely to bias the estimation of error and to
appear as departure from an otherwise appropriate model. Sometimes a time point
has some valid observations and some that need to be excluded. A general rule
is to use a time point only if there are at least three acceptable
observations. Otherwise the whole time point should be excluded. If the study
is properly planned, there should still be sufficient data to determine an
appropriate regression line through the linear part of the depletion curve.<P>
<b>STEP 2. </b>Determine that the variances of Ln concentrations at each
slaughter time are constant.<P>
No matter what form the depletion model assumes, the variances at each
slaughter time should be constant. Recall that because this is a log-linear
model, variances of the Ln concentration should be tested. Computations for
using Bartlett's test for heterogeneity are listed below. Bartlett's test is
not the only one available for this purpose, nor is it always the best. Here,
however, FDA takes its non-significant P-value (P = 0.234) as support that the
variances are constant.<P>

Chi^2 (g-1) = M/C = 5.56: P = 0.234<P>
<b>STEP 3. </b>Check the assumption of log-linearity.<P>
The test of linearity is a standard analysis of variance procedure. Its
application to these data is summarized below. The test for departure from
linearity, judged non-significant (P&gt;0.25), supports the assumption that the
data describe a linear process. If the departure from linearity is
substantially more significant than 0.25, check again for points that do not
belong to the linear part of the depletion curve as described in step 1. An
unusually large or small observation at one time point can also produce a poor
lack of fit. A discussion of possible explanations for departure from linearity
is appropriate.<P>

d = z/[1/n + (t - mean of t)^2/sum of (t(i) - mean of t)^2]^.05<P>
 z = the 99th percentile of the standard normal distribution<P>
The sponsor should determine the withdrawal period as follows:<P>
<b>STEP 1. </b>Fix a candidate withdrawal period, in this case 14 days, and
calculate d.<P>
d = 2.3264/(0.1428)^.05 = 6.1566<P>
<b>STEP 2. </b>Calculate k. See D. B. Owen, <i>Handbook of Statistical
Tables,</i> Addison-Wesley, Reading,. Massachusetts (1962). Using the value of
d and a table of factors for computing critical values of the non-central
t-distribution with Pr = 0.95 and 23 degrees of freedom, k is 8.9248. (There is
statistical software available for computing the non-central t-values. For SAS
users, the TINV function is available through the SUGI Supplemental Library
User's Guide under "Nine Functions for Probability Distributions." Subroutines
are also available through International Mathematical and Statistical Library.
There may be other sources as well.)<P>
<P>
<b>STEP 3. </b>Calculate the tolerance limit and its antilog. Check to see if
the antilog exceeds the permitted value. If so, increase t and repeat the
calculation. If not, then t is the recommended withdrawal period.<P>
exp[3.93266 + (-0.15983)(14) + (8.9248)(0.27727)(0.3779)] = 13.88<P>
Because the tolerance limit of the residue concentration exceeds the permitted
concentration of 9 ppb, the calculation is repeated using 15, 16, 17, and 18
days as the candidate withdrawal period. The tolerance limit at 18 days is 7.86
ppb. Therefore, 18 days is the assigned withdrawal period.<P>

Residue Data from Milk<P>
For ease of presentation, this example will use data from the simulated results
of a residue depletion study in milk from 10 animals only, rather than the
recommended 20 animals. The drug product is for. the treatment of mastitis.
Milk samples were obtained from each cow every 12 hours from 12 to 48 hours
after the last dose. The results of the triplicate analysis for the marker
residue in milk are given below. The validated limit of the method is 0.005 ppm
and the limit of detection is 0.001 ppm. The permitted concentration for the
marker residue R(M) is 0.0061 ppm.<P>

<b>Step 1. </b>Fit a Linear Regression for the Data from Each Animal<P>
The Ln concentration of residue of each separate assay for each animal is
plotted versus time. These plots are helpful in determining which time points
are in the final linear phase of the depletion curve closest to the established
tolerance. For each animal only those points that fall on this final depletion
phase should be used for subsequent calculations.<P>
Fit a straight line to each animal's data by the least squares method. The
residual sums of squares are partitioned into the "pure error" sums of squares
and the "lack of fit" sums of squares. An F test is used for the final
determination of the points to be included in the regression. The mean square
for "pure error" is taken as an estimate for assay variance. Pooling error
terms is not appropriate because the F test is used to determine which time
points to include in the subsequent analysis of the data. For each animal only
those consecutive data points that lie on the linear portion of the curve
should be used. The determination should be done on an animal by animal basis.
In this example all time points may be used for all animals. The results of the
calculations and the appropriate degrees of freedom, DF, are shown in the table
below.<br>

<br>
<b>Step 2. </b>Estimate the Mean and Sample Variance of the Predicted Values<P>
Calculate the mean intercept (mean of a) and mean slope (mean of b). In this

regression equation for animal i at time t is denoted by  y (i,t) = a(i)+b(i)t.
The sample mean of the y(i, t)'s is calculated by mean of y(.,t) = mean of a +
mean of bt. The sample variance of the y(i,t)'s, s^2  y(i,t)' is calculated
next. We pick a tentative withdrawal time t and calculate mean of y (.,t) and
s^2 y(i,t).<P>
At t = 48 hours y (.,48) = -4.86 and s^2 y(i, 48) = 1.52. Note, the
calculation of S^2 y(i,t) must be performed anew for each time t, or use the
sample variance of a(i) and b(i) as well as the sample covariance of a(i) with
b(i).<P>
<b>Step 3. </b>Estimate the Between Animal Variance<P>
The<b> </b>estimated sample variance calculated in step 2 is the sum of the
between animal variance and the variance due to estimation of the intercepts
and slopes. The between animal variance can be determined by subtraction once
the variance due to estimation of the intercepts and slopes is determined.<P>
For each animal we can estimate the variance of the predicted value y(i,t)
based solely upon the regression data of that animal. We  denote this estimate
by s^2 reg(i,t). The mean square for "pure error" should be used in this
calculation in place of the unknown population variance (Ref. 2, formula
1.4.6). We then calculate the mean of the variance over all cows sum of s^2
reg(i t)/n. The between animal variance is then estimated by s^2 y(i,t) - sum
of s^2 reg (i,t)/n<P>
In our example at 48 hours for cow #l, s^2 reg(1.48) = 0.0154, averaging over
the values for the ten cows gives 0.0207. Therefore, at 48 hours the estimate
for the between animal variance is 1.50 (1.52 - 0.0207).<P>
<b>Step 4.</b> Estimate the Non-Centrality Parameter<P>
The non-centrality parameter, d, for a residue depletion study in tissue is a
function of the known time points used in the regression and the proposed
withdrawal period. Unfortunately, for a residue depletions study in milk, the
noncentrality parameter is a function of the true assay variance and the true
between animal variance. Because the "true" values are unknown, an estimate of
the non-centrality parameter is made using sample estimates in place of the
"true" values. An estimate of the assay variance was calculated in step I (mean
square "pure error") and an estimate of the between animal variance was
calculated in step 3 (s^2 y(i,t) - sum of s^2 <P>
d = z [((s^2 y(i,t) - sum of s^2 reg(i,t)/n)/m) + s^2) / (s^2 y(i,t)/n)]^.05<P>
z = the 99th percentile of the standard normal distribution = 2.32635<P>
m = the minimum number of treated animals contributing milk to the bulk tank
that may be tested. FDA has chosen 10 as the value to be used in this
calculation. This value is not related to the sample size of 10 in this
example.<P>
s^2 = the sample assay variance calculated in step 1 (mean square for "pure
error.")<P>
n = the sample size = 10 in this example.<P>
Evaluating the expression for this example gives d = 2.92.<P>
<b>Step 5. </b>Calculate the 95th Percentile of the Non-Central
t-Distribution<P>
The next step is the calculation of the 95th percentile of the non-central
t-distribution (k) with n-1 degrees of freedom and non-centrality factor, d.<P>
Tables that can be used for this calculation are found in D. B. Owen,
<i>Handbook of Statistical Tables. </i>Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts
(1962). For SAS users, the TINV function documented under "Nine Functions for
Probability Distributions" in <i>SUGI Supplemental Library User's Guide
</i>performs this calculation for a non-negative non-centrality parameter. A
program for the IBM PC and compatibles is available from CVM.<P>
In this example at 48 hours, k = 5.76.<P>
<b>Step 6. </b>Calculate the Desired Tolerance Limit<P>
The desired tolerance limit at any time t is T(t) = mean of y(.,t) + k(s^2
y(i,t)/n)^0.5<P>
In this example the drug product is used to treat mastitis and FDA has decided
that no more than one-third of the milk in a bulk tank will come from treated
animals. Therefore, we wish the 99% tolerance limit to be below 3 times the
permitted residue concentration. The withdrawal time t must therefore obey the
rule<P>
Ln (3 times permitted concentration) &gt;=  T(t).<P>
In this example, Ln  (3 times 0.0061) = -4.02. The tolerance limit at 48 hours
is -2.62. Since the inequality does not hold, choose another time and repeat
calculations starting at step 2 above. We discover that at t = 60 hours, -4.02
&gt;= -4.70, so the withdrawal period is 60 hours.<P><P><hr>

<html><head> <title>Guide 3 Part5</title></head><body>V. GUIDELINE FOR<br>
APPROVAL OF A METHOD OF ANALYSIS FOR RESIDUES<P>
A. INTRODUCTION<P>
Before approving a carcinogenic or noncarcinogenic compound for use in
food-producing animals, FDA generally asks that the sponsor provide an
acceptable analytical method (either chemical or biological) capable of
reliably measuring the marker residue to ensure that the total residue of
toxicological concern is not exceeded. The determination of the total residue
of toxicological concern can be accomplished by: (a) choosing a marker residue,
(b) establishing a quantitative relationship between the marker residue and
total residue of toxicological concern, and (c) calculating the maximum
permitted concentration of marker residue, R(M), in the target tissue (the
tissue used to monitor for total drug residues in all tissues) to ensure that
the total residue of toxicological concert does not exceed the permitted
concentration.<P>
The process of obtaining approval of a method consists of three steps:<P>
Step 1. Method development by the sponsor and demonstration that the method
satisfies the acceptability criteria (part B of this guideline).<P>
Step 2. FDA desk review of the sponsor's data (part C I of this guideline) to
determine suitability of the method for nterlaboratory study.<P>
Step 3. Interlaboratory Study (part C 2 of this guideline) to determine whether
the method performs as claimed and thus can be used as a practicable and
reliable regulatory tool.<P>
Because methods which appear marginally acceptable after desk review often do
not pass the interlaboratory validation trials, sponsors are urged to develop
methods that are rugged, and exceed rather than meet the minimal standards of
acceptability.<P>
B. EVALUATION CRITERIA<P>
Any method will be characterized by a set of attributes that determine its
applicability: <i>specificity</i> (what is being measured), <i>precision</i>
(the variability of the measurement), and <i>systematic error</i> (or bias,
measured as recovery).<P>
1. Specificity<P>
Specificity is the ability of a method to respond only to the substance being
measured. The proposed method must provide for identification of the compound
being measured. Certain instrumental techniques such as infrared spectroscopy
or mass spectrometry may be sufficiently specific by themselves. If the method
is not sufficiently specific, then a confirmatory or identification procedure
will be needed. In those cases, the regulatory method will have two components,
the "determinative" procedure to quantify a given compound and the
"confirmatory" procedure to verify the identity of the compound. Other
techniques can achieve comparable specificity if used in combination. For
example, specificity may be verified by thin-layer chromatography,
element-specific gas liquid chromatography, formation of characteristic
derivatives and rechromatography, and characteristic relative retention times
with several different chromatographic systems of different polarity. Such
procedures must be applicable at the designated marker residue concentration
R(M).<P>
The sponsor should take into account the possible presence of other compounds
approved for use in the same target species and should demonstrate that they
will not interfere with the determination of the sponsored compound by the
proposed method.<P>
2. Precision<P>
Precision is an important quantitative performance characteristic of a method.
It is a measure of the variability of repetitive measurements. Contributions of
variability from numerous sources affect precision, but the major components
are those from different laboratories (reproducibility) and those from within a
laboratory (repeatability). Precision is usually expressed as a standard
deviation, but an even more useful term is the relative standard deviation (or
coefficient of variation) because it is relatively constant over a considerable
concentration range.<P>
The variability finally achieved in the sponsor's laboratory after considerable
experience usually is less than that achievable by less experienced
laboratories who may later use the method. The final version of the method
should be optimized by such procedures as ruggedness testing (W. J. Youden and
E. H. Steiner, <i>Statistical Manual of the AOAC, </i>Association of Official
Analytical Chemists, Box 540 Benjamin Franklin Station, Washington, DC 1975, p.
33). If a method cannot achieve a suitable degree of repeatability in the
sponsor's laboratory, it cannot be expected to do any better in other
laboratories. The method should be performed by an analyst not involved in the
development of the method to verify the adequacy of the method's description
and the identification of critical parameters.<P>
The within laboratory coefficient of variation should not exceed 10% where the
designated concentration of marker residue R(M) is greater than or equal to 0.1
ppm. Where the designated concentration of marker residue R(M) is less than 0.1
ppm, the within laboratory coefficient of variation should not exceed 20%.<P>
3. Systematic Error<P>
Systematic error, or bias, is the difference of the measured value from the
true, assigned, or accepted value. It is generally expressed as the percent
recovery of added analyte, realizing, in the case of residue analysis, that
analyte added to a sample may not behave in the same manner as the same analyte
biologically incurred. At relatively high concentrations, recoveries are
expected to approach 100%. At lower concentrations, and particularly with
methods involving a number of steps which may include extractions, solvent
transfers, and adsorption chromatography, recoveries may be lower.<P>
Assuming acceptable precision, an average recovery of 80 to 110% should be
obtained when the designated concentration of marker residue R(M) is 0.1 ppm or
greater. An average recovery of 60 to 110% will be accepted when the designated
concentration of marker residue R(M) is less than 0.1 ppm. Correction factors
are not ordinarily acceptable unless they are an inherent part of the
procedure, as in definitive radioisotope dilution procedures. Since higher
recoveries (greater than 110%) may indicate a lack of specificity, FDA will ask
for an explanation for such values. FDA will accept lower recovery values than
those presented above for methods employing internal standards.<P>
4. Collateral Criteria<P>
The method should: (a) utilize commercially available reagents, supplies,
instruments (except that new or unusual reagents or standards may be supplied
by the sponsor on request); (b) be capable of being performed by reasonably
experienced analysts: (c) be capable of being completed within reasonable time
periods consistent with regulatory objectives (usually no more than 48 hours of
total elapsed time); (d) not need unique instrumentation, large quantities of
solvents, reagents, and supplies which would render the method economically
impractical; and (e) be capable of being performed safely.<P>
There are several other indications of satisfactory performance that may be
helpful in determining if the method is acceptable. These factors may include
requirements for a linear calibration (standard) curve and analytical
(recovery) curve; effectiveness of extraction; the effect (or noneffect) of
specific potential interferences; adequate sensitivity (slope of the
calibration curve) and resolution; adequately low and constant blanks; and
stability studies.<P>
In practical regulatory use, samples are examined without benefit of treatment
history. For interpretation of the analytical response observed in analyses of
actual samples, the response for the marker residue should be clearly resolved
from any other responses present and should be readily distinguishable above
the background signal. (For example, in a gas chromatographic determination,
the marker residue peak(s) should be resolved and clearly recognizable from
other peaks. At the designated concentration of marker residue, R(M), the
response should be a peak at least 20 mm in height and at least 10 times
greater than the variability of the background response.)<P>
C. SPECIFIC DATA NEEDED<P>
1. Sponsor's Petition<P>
In development of regulatory methods, sponsors should collect data from three
types of samples: (a) "control" target tissue from untreated animals, (b)
"fortified" target tissue containing known concentrations of the marker residue
added to the sample of control target tissue, and (c) "dosed' target tissue
from animals of the target species that have been treated with the drug. The
sponsor should determine the baseline (background) response of the method and
its variability. The sponsor should demonstrate that the proposed method can
satisfactorily recover and identify known amounts of the marker residue which
have been added to the target tissue. Finally, the sponsor should demonstrate
that the proposed method can satisfactorily recover the biologically incurred
marker residue.<P>
In presenting a petition for approval of a proposed regulatory method, the
sponsor should provide:<P>
* A complete description of the method including sampling, preparation of
analytical samples, storage conditions, reagents, instrumentation, standards,
and identification of critical steps and stopping places.<P>
* Quality control criteria that may be needed to verify<br>
and maintain method performance.<P>
* A typical standard curve prepared from marker residue of known purity.<P>
* A typical analytical curve prepared by fortifying (spiking) control tissue
with marker residue and observing the resulting analytical responses.<P>
* Data derived from control, fortified, and dosed tissue showing that the
method meetsthe specificity, precision, and systematic error attributes.<P>
* Relevant worksheets, calculations, statistical analyses, spectrograms,
chromatograms, etc., from the analyses of control, fortified and dosed target
tissue.<P>
* Using the proposed determinative procedure of the method, results of analyses
of the following samples (as a minimum):<P>
- 5 control tissues<br>
- 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at 0.5X R(M)<br>
- 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at 1X R(M)<br>
- 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at 2X R(M)<br>
- 5 dosed tissues containing biologically incurred total residue at
approximately its permitted concentration.<P>
* Using the proposed confirmatory procedure, results of analyses to verify the
identity of the marker residue with the following samples (as a minimum):<P>
- 5 control tissues to ensure the absence of false positives<br>
- 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at R(M)<br>
- 5 dosed tissues containing biologically incurred total residue at
approximately its permitted concentration.<P>
2. Interlaboratory Study<P>
After the regulatory method has passed desk review (section 1, above), FDA will
conduct an interlaboratory trial of the proposed method to verify that the
regulatory method can be employed as a practicable and reliable regulatory
tool. At a minimum, the method will be tested in two FDA laboratories and one
USDA laboratory using target tissues supplied by the sponsor.<P>
Each of the three laboratories will analyze the following samples by the
determinative procedure:<P>
* 5 control tissues<br>
* 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at 0.5X R(M)<br>
* 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at 1X R(M)<br>
* 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at 2X R(M)<br>
* 5 dosed tissues containing biologically incurred total residue at
approximately its permitted concentration.<P>
If a separate procedure is necessary to confirm the identity of the marker
residue, each of the three laboratories will analyze the following samples:<P>
* 5 control tissues<br>
* 5 control tissues fortified with marker residue at R(M) <br>
* 5 dosed tissues containing biologically incurred total residue at
approximately its permitted concentration.<P>
(Whenever possible the confirmatory procedure should be performed on the same
extract used for the determinative portion of the method.) <P>
Alternatively, the sponsor may elect to conduct a collaborative study of the
proposed method under the auspices of an organization such as the Association
of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC). The study would include the three
aforementioned government laboratories and the sponsor's laboratory. The
sponsor would be responsible for obtaining the additional collaborators and for
supplying the participating laboratories with all the necessary target tissues
(control, fortified, and dosed). A minimum of six laboratories would be needed
to constitute a collaborative study. The number of tissue samples analyzed by
each participating laboratory can be reduced from five to a minimum of two for
each group listed above.<P><P><hr>

<h3>BIOEQUIVALENCE GUIDANCE (FINAL) 1996</h3>
CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE<br>
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>
7500 STANDISH PLACE<br>
ROCKVILLE, MD 20855<P>

Docket No. 94D-0401<P>
<hr>

<B>PREAMBLE</B><P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has revised the April 1990 Bioequivalence 
Guideline.  The 1996 Bioequivalence Guidance is issued in final following notice
and comment.<p>
Many of the changes in the guidance are based upon reports from panel presentations
at the 1993 Veterinary Drug Bioequivalence Workshop in Rockville, Maryland, sponsored
by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), the Animal Health Institute (AHI), the
American Academy of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics (AAVPT), and the Animal
Drug Alliance<b>1</b>.  Some new topics have been introduced into the guidance
as a result of issues identified in the review of bioequivalence protocols and studies.
<p>
The major new topics in the guidance are as follows:<ol>
<li>Higher than approved dose bioequivalence studies.
<li>Bioequivalence testing for multiple strength solid oral dosage forms.
<li>Assay considerations for bioequivalence studies.
<li>AUC and CMAX as the pivotal parameters for bioequivalence determination.
<li>Blood level bioequivalence studies to be accompanied by tissue residue depletion
studies for generic products for food-producing animals.</ol>
A person may follow the guidance or may choose to follow alternate procedures or practices. 
If a person chooses to use alternate procedures or practices, that person may wish to discuss
the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure
of money and effort on activities that may later be determined 
to be unacceptable to FDA.  Although this guidance document does not bind the agency or
the public, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or
benefits for or on any person, it represents FDA's current thinking on bioequivalence
testing for animal drugs.  When a guidance document states a requirement imposed
by statute or regulation, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not
changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the guidance.

<h3>
 <a name="intro">I.  INTRODUCTION</a> 
</h3>This document is intended to provide guidance for the design and analysis of
<i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence studies.  The guideline is an update of the April 12,
1990 Bioequivalence Guideline.  Many of the changes in the guideline are based
upon reports from panel presentations at the 1993 Veterinary Drug
Bioequivalence Workshop<b>1.</b><P>
Two products are considered to be bioequivalent when they are equally
bioavailable; that is, equal in the rate and extent to which the active
ingredient(s) or therapeutic ingredient(s) is (are) absorbed and become(s)
available at the site(s) of drug action.   <P>
The Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA)
signed into law on November 16, 1988, permits sponsors to submit an Abbreviated
New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) for a generic version of any off-patent
approved animal drug (with certain exceptions noted in the law) regardless of
whether the drug was approved prior to 1962 and subject to the NAS/NRC/DESI
review.  <P>
Bioequivalence studies are used in a variety of situations, most often when a
sponsor proposes manufacturing a generic version of an approved off-patent
product.  A bioequivalence study may also be part of a new animal drug
application (NADA) or supplemental NADA for approval of an alternative dosage
form, new route of administration, or a significant manufacturing change which
may affect drug bioavailability.<P>
The Center has concluded that the tissue residue depletion of 
the generic product is not adequately addressed through bioequivalence studies.
Therefore, ANADA's for drug products for food-producing animals will generally
be required to include bioequivalence and tissue residue studies.
A tissue residue study will generally be required to accompany clinical end-point
 and pharmacologic end-point bioequivalence studies, and blood level
 bioequivalence studies that can not quantify the concentration of the drug in blood throughout
 the established withdrawal period.<P>
 Bioequivalence studies (<i>i.e.</i>, blood level, pharmacologic end-point,
 and clinical end-point studies) and tissue residue depletion studies should be conducted in
 accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations [21 CFR Part 58].<P>
Whereas the focus of the Guideline is bioequivalence testing for 
ANADA approval, the general principles also apply to relative bioavailability
studies conducted for NADA's.<P>
Sponsors should consult with the Center early in the product development
process to facilitate the design of studies adequate for drug approval.  The
Center urges sponsors to submit protocols 
for review prior to conducting studies.<P>

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
</a></h3>

<b>
<A NAME="twoa">A.
Selection of Reference Product for Bioequivalence Testing
</a></b>
 <P>
As a general rule, the proposed generic product should be  tested against the
original pioneer product.<P>
If the original pioneer product is no longer marketed, but remains eligible to
be copied, then the first approved and available generic copy of the pioneer should be used
as the reference product for bioequivalence testing against the proposed new
generic product.<P>
If several approved NADA's exist for the same drug product, and each approved
product is labeled differently (<i>i.e.</i>, different species and/or claims),
then the generic sponsor must clearly identify which product label is the
intended pioneer.  Bioequivalence testing should be conducted against the
single approved product which bears the labeling that the generic sponsor
intends to copy.<P>
The generic sponsor should consult with CVM regarding selection of the
appropriate reference product before conducting the bioequivalence study.<P>

<b>
<A NAME="twob">B.
Criteria for Waiver of <i>In Vivo </i>&#160;Bioequivalence Study
</a></b>
<P>
The requirement for the <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study may be waived for
certain generic products.  Categories of products which may be eligible for
waivers include, but are not limited to, the following: <ol>
<li>Parenteral solutions intended for injection by the intravenous,
subcutaneous, or intramuscular routes of administration.<P>
<li>Oral solutions or other solubilized forms.<P>
<li>Topically applied solutions intended for local therapeutic effects.  Other
topically applied dosage forms intended for local therapeutic effects for
non-food animals only.<P>
<li>Inhalant volatile anesthetic solutions.</ol>
In general, the generic product being considered for a waiver contains the same
active and inactive ingredients in the same dosage form and concentration and
has the same pH and physico-chemical characteristics as an approved pioneer
product.<P>
However, the Center will consider bioequivalence waivers for non-food animal
topical products with certain differences in the inactive ingredients of the
pioneer and generic products.<P>
If a waiver of the <i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalence and/or the tissue residue
study/studies is granted for a food animal drug product, then the withdrawal
period established for the pioneer product will be assigned to the generic
product.<P>
Sponsors may apply for waivers of <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence studies prior
to submission of the ANADA's.<P>

<b>
<A NAME="twoc">C.
Selection of Blood Level, Pharmacologic End-point, or Clinical End-point Study   
</a></b>
<P>
<i>In vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence may be determined by one of several direct or
indirect methods.  Selection of the method depends upon the purpose of the
study, the analytical method available, and the nature of the drug product.
Bioequivalence testing should be conducted using the most appropriate method
available for the specific use of the product.   <P>
The preferred hierarchy of bioequivalence studies (in descending order of
sensitivity) is the blood level study, pharmacologic end-point study, and
clinical end-point study.  When absorption of the drug is sufficient to measure
drug concentration <i>directly</i>&#160; in the blood (or other appropriate
biological fluids or tissues) and systemic absorption is relevant to the drug
action, then a blood (or other biological fluid or tissue) level bioequivalence
study should be conducted.  The blood level study is generally preferred above
all others as the most sensitive measure of bioequivalence.  The sponsor should
provide justification for choosing either a pharmacologic or clinical end-point
study over a blood-level (or other biological fluids or tissues) study.<P>
When the measurement of the rate and extent of absorption of the drug in
biological fluids can not be achieved or is unrelated to drug action, a
pharmacologic end-point (<i>i.e.</i>, drug induced physiologic change which is related
to the approved indications for use) study
may be conducted.  Lastly, in order of preference, if drug concentrations in
blood (or fluids or tissues) are not measurable or are inappropriate, and there
are no appropriate pharmacologic effects that can be monitored, then a clinical
end-point study may be conducted, comparing the test (generic) product to the
reference (pioneer) product and a placebo (or negative) control.   <P>

<b>
<A NAME="twod">
D. Species Selection
</a></b>
<P>
A bioequivalence study is generally required for each species 
for which the pioneer product is approved.  However,
bioequivalence testing may not be required for every "minor" species on the
label. <P>
 
<b>
<A NAME="twoe">E.
Dose Selection
</a></b>
<P>
Dose selection will depend upon the label claims, consideration of assay
sensitivity, and relevance to the practical use conditions of the reference
product.  A blood level bioequivalence study should generally be conducted at
the highest dose approved for the pioneer product.  <P>

However, the Center will consider a bioequivalence study conducted at a higher
than approved dose in certain cases.  Such a study may be appropriate when a
multiple of the highest approved dose achieves measurable blood levels, but the
highest approved dose does not. In
general, the study would be limited to 2-3x the highest dose approved
for the pioneer product.  The pioneer
product must have an adequate margin of safety at the higher than approved dose 
level. The generic sponsor must also confirm (<i>e.g.</i>, through literature)
that the drug follows linear kinetics.  A higher than approved dose
bioequivalence study in food animal species would be accompanied by a tissue
residue withdrawal study conducted at the highest approved dose for the pioneer
product.
<P>


For products labeled for multiple claims involving different
pharmacologic actions at a broad dose range
 (<i>e.g.,</i>&#160; therapeutic and production claims), a single bioequivalence 
 study at the highest approved dose will usually be adequate. However, 
multiple bioequivalence studies at different doses may be needed if the drug is 
known to follow nonlinear kinettics.  The sponsor should consult with CVM to discuss the bioequivalence study or 
 studies appropriate
 to a particular drug.
<P>

<b>
<A NAME="twof">F.
Multiple Strengths of Solid Oral Dosage Forms 
</a></b>
<P>
The generic sponsor should discuss with CVM the appropriate <i>in vivo</i>&#160;
bioequivalence testing and <i>in vitro</i>&#160; dissolution testing to obtain
approval for multiple strengths (or concentrations) of solid oral dosage forms.<P>
CVM will consider the ratio of active to inactive ingredients and the <i>in vitro</i>&#160;
dissolution profiles of the different strengths, the water solubility of the drug,
and the range of strengths for which approval is sought.<P>
One <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study with highest strength product
may suffice if the multiple strength products have the same ratio of active 
to inactive ingredients and are otherwise identical in formulation.<P>
<i>In vitro </i>&#160;dissolution testing should be conducted, using an FDA approved
method, to compare each strength of the generic product to the corresponding
strength of the reference product.<P>
<b>
<A NAME="twog">G. Manufacturing of Pilot Batch ("Biobatch") </a></b>
 <P>
A pilot batch or "biobatch" should be the source of the finished drug product
used in the pivotal studies (<i>i.e</i>., bioequivalence studies and tissue
residue studies), stability studies and the validation studies for the proposed
analytical and stability indicating methods (refer to CVM's "Animal Drug
Manufacturing Guidelines, 1994").<P>
 
<h3>
  
<A NAME="blood">  III.  Blood Level Studies </a>
  </h3>
<P>
Blood level bioequivalence studies compare a test (generic) product to a
reference (pioneer) product using parameters derived from the concentrations of
the drug moiety and/or its metabolites, as a function of time, in whole blood,
plasma, serum (or in other appropriate biological fluids or tissues).  This
approach is particularly applicable to dosage forms intended to deliver the
active drug ingredient(s) to the  systemic circulation (<i>e.g</i>., injectable
drugs and most oral dosage forms).  Generally, the study should encompass both
the absorption, distribution, and depletion (elimination) phases of the drug
concentration <i>vs </i>time profiles.  <P>

 
 <b>
<A NAME="threea">A. Assay Consideration </a></b> 

<P>
 A properly validated assay method is pivotal to the acceptability of any
pharmacokinetic study.  Sponsors should discuss any questions or problems
concerning the analytical methodology with CVM before undertaking the
bioequivalence studies.  The ANADA submission must contain adequate information
necessary for the CVM reviewer to determine the validity of the analytical
method used to quantitate the level of drug in the biological matrix
(<i>e.g.</i>, blood).<P>
 The following aspects should be addressed in assessing method performance:<ol>
<LI> Concentration Range and Linearity<P>
The quantitative relationship between concentration and response should be
adequately characterized over the entire range of expected sample
concentrations. For linear relationships, a standard curve should be defined by
at least 5 concentrations.  If the concentration response function is
non-linear, additional points would be necessary to define the non-linear
portions of the curve. Extrapolation beyond a standard curve is not acceptable.
<P>
<LI> Limit of Detection (LOD)<P>
The standard deviation of the background signal and LOD should be determined.
The LOD is estimated as the response value calculated by adding 3 times the
standard deviation of the background response to the average background
response. <P>
<LI> Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)<P>
The initial determination of LOQ should involve the addition of 10 times the
standard deviation of the background response to the average background
response. The second step in determining LOQ is assessing the precision
(reproducibility) and accuracy (recovery) of the method at the LOQ. The LOQ
will generally be the lowest concentration on the standard curve that can be
quantified with acceptable accuracy and precision (see items 5. and 6. below).
<P>
<LI> Specificity<P>
 The absence of matrix interferences should be demonstrated by the analysis of
6 independent 
sources of control matrix. The effect of environmental,
physiological, or procedural variables on the matrix should be assessed.  Each
independent control matrix will be used to produce a standard curve, which will
be compared to a standard curve produced under chemically defined conditions.
The comparison of curves should exhibit parallelism and superimposability
within the limits of analytical variation established for the chemically
defined standard curve.<P>
<LI> Accuracy (Recovery)<P>
 This parameter should be evaluated using at least 3 known concentrations
of analyte freshly spiked in control matrix, one being at a point 2 standard deviations above the LOQ, 
one in the middle of the range of the standard curve ("mid-range") and one at 
a point 2 standard deviations below the upper quantitative limit of the
standard curve.  The accuracy of the method, based upon the mean
value of 6 replicate injections, at each concentration level, should be
within 80-120% of the nominal concentration at each level (high, mid-range, and
LOQ). <P>
<LI> Precision <P>
 This parameter should be evaluated using at least 3 known concentrations
of analyte freshly spiked in control matrix, at the same points used for 
determination of accuracy. The coefficient of variation (CV) of 6 replicates 
should be  &#177; 10% for concentrations at or above 0.1 ppm (0.1
 &#181;  g/mL).  A CV of  &#177; 20% is acceptable for concentrations below 0.1 ppm.
<P>
<LI> Analyte Stability<P>
Stability of the analyte in the biological matrix under the conditions of the
experiment (including any period for which samples are stored before analyses)
should be established. It is recommended that the stability be determined with
incurred analyte in the matrix of dosed animals in addition to, or instead of,
control matrix spiked with pure analyte. Also, the influence of 3
freeze-thaw cycles at 2 concentrations should be determined. <P>
 Stability samples at 3 concentrations should be stored with the study samples
and analyzed through the period of time in which study samples are analyzed.
These analyses will establish whether or not analyte levels have decreased
during the time of analysis.<P>
<LI> Analytical System Stability<P>
 To assure that the analytical system remains stable over the time course of
the assay, 
the reproducibility of the standard curve should be monitored during the assay.
 A minimal design would be to
run analytical standards at the beginning and at the end of the analytical
run.<P>
<LI> Quality Control (QC) Samples<P>
The purpose of QC samples is to assure that the complete analytical method, 
sample preparation, 
extraction, clean-up, and instrumental analysis perform according 
to acceptable criteria.  QC samples require that the stability of the drug in the test matrix
be known and any tendency for the drug to bind to tissue or serum
components over time should also be known.<P> 
Drug free control matrix, <i>e.g.</i>, tissue, serum, etc. that is freshly
spiked known quantities of test drug, should be analyzed contemporaneously with
test samples, evenly dispersed throughout each analytical run.  This requirement
can be met by the determination of accuracy and precision of each analytical run (Items
5 and 6).
<P>
<LI>Replicate and Repeat Analyses<P>
Single rather than replicate analyses are recommended, unless the
reproducibility and/or accuracy of the method are borderline. Criteria for
repeat analyses should be determined prior to running the study and recorded in
the method SOP. <P>
<LI>Summary of Samples to Be Run With Each Analysis<P>

b.  Precision estimate (Item 6)<br>
c.  Analytical system stability (Item 8)<br>

</ol>
<b>
<A NAME="threeb">B. General Experimental Design Considerations </a></b>  
 
<ol>
 
  <li> Dosing by Labeled Concentration  
  <P>
 The potency of the pioneer and generic products should be assayed prior to
conducting the bioequivalence study to ensure that FDA or compendial
specifications are met.   The Center recommends that the potency of the pioneer
and generic lots should differ by no more than &#177;5% for dosage form products.<P>
The animals should be dosed according to the labeled concentration or strength
of the product, rather than the assayed potency of the individual batch
(<i>i.e.</i>, the dose should not be corrected for the assayed potency of the
product).  The bioequivalence data or derived parameters should not be
normalized to account for any potency differences between the pioneer and
generic product lots.<P>
  
 <li> Single Dose vs Multiple Dose Studies  <P>
A single dose study at the highest approved dose will generally be adequate for
the demonstration of bioequivalence.  A single dose study at a higher
than approved dose may be appropriate for certain drugs (refer to the section
on Dose Selection).<P>
A multiple dose study may be appropriate when there are concerns
regarding poorly predictable drug accumulation, (<i>e.g. </i>,a drug with
nonlinear kinetics) or a drug with a
 narrow therapeutic window.  A multiple dose study may
also be needed when assay sensitivity is inadequate to permit drug
quantification out to 3 terminal elimination half-lives beyond the time when
maximum blood concentrations (CMAX) are achieved, or in cases where 
prolonged or delayed absorption<b>2</b> exist.  The determination of prolonged or 
delayed absorption (<i>i.e.</i>, flip-flop kinetics) may be made from pilot data, 
from the literature, or from the 
CVM database on the particular drug or family of drugs.
<P>
 
   <li> Subject Characteristics   <P>
Ordinarily, studies should be conducted with healthy animals representative of
the species, class, gender, 
and physiological maturity for which the drug is approved.  The bioequivalence
study may be conducted with a single gender for which the pioneer product is
approved, unless there is a known interaction of formulation with gender. <P>
    
An attempt should be made to restrict the weight of the test animals to a
narrow range in order to maintain the same total dose across study subjects.  <P>
The animals should not receive any medication prior to testing for a period of
two weeks or more, depending upon the biological half-life of the ancillary
drug.  <P>
 
 <li> Fed vs Fasted State    <P>
Feeding may either enhance or interfere with drug absorption, depending upon
the characteristics of the drug and the formulation.  Feeding may also increase
the inter- and intrasubject variability in the rate and extent of drug
absorption.  The rationale for conducting each bioequivalence study under
fasting or fed conditions should be provided in the protocol.<P>
Fasting conditions, if used, should be fully described, giving careful
consideration to the pharmacokinetics of the drug and the humane treatment of
the test animals.  <P>
The protocol should describe the diet and feeding regime which will be used in
the study.    
 <P>
 If a pioneer product label indicates that the product is limited to administration
 either in the fed or fasted state, then the bioequivalence study should be 
 conducted accordingly.  If the bioequivalence study parameters
 pass the agreed upon confidence intervals, then the single study is
 acceptable as the basis for approval of the generic drug. <P>
 However,
 for certain product classifications or drug entities, such as enteric
coated and oral sustained release products, demonstration of bioequivalence in
both the fasted and the fed states may be necessary, if drug bioavailability is highly 
variable under feeding conditions, as determined from the literature or from
pilot data.  A bioequivalence study conducted under fasted conditions may 
be necessary to pass the confidence intervals.  A second smaller study may
be necessary to examine meal effects.  CVM will evaluate the smaller study
with respect to the means of the pivotal parameters (AUC, CMAX). The 
 sponsors should consult
with CVM prior to conducting  the studies.</ol>

   <b>
<A NAME="threec">C. Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Considerations in Study Design
 </a> </b>
 <ol>
 
  <li> Sampling Time Considerations     
 <P>
The total number of sampling times necessary to  characterize the blood 
level profiles  will depend upon the curvature of the profiles and the 
magnitude of variability associated with the bioavailability data 
(including pharmacokinetic variability, assay error and interproduct 
differences in absorption kinetics).  <P>
 The sampling times should adequately define peak concentration(s) and the
extent of absorption.  The  sampling times should extend to at least 3
terminal elimination half-lives beyond TMAX.  The sponsor should  consult
with CVM prior to conducting the pivotal bioequivalence study if the assay
is unable to quantify samples to 3 half-lives.<P>
Maximum sampling time efficiency may be achieved by conducting a pilot
investigation.  The pilot study should identify the general shapes of the test
and reference curves, the magnitude of the difference in product profiles, and
the noise associated with each blood sampling time (<i>e.g</i>., variability
attributable to assay error and the variability between subjects, for parallel
study designs, or within subjects, for crossover study designs).  This
information should be applied to the determination of an optimum blood sampling
schedule.  Depending upon these variability estimates, it may be more efficient
to cluster several blood samples rather than to have samples which are
periodically dispersed throughout the duration of blood
sampling.<b>3</b><p>
 
 
  <li> Protein Binding  <P> 
    
 In general, product bioequivalence should be based upon total (free plus
protein bound) concentrations of the parent drug (or metabolite, when
applicable).  However, if nonlinear protein binding is known to occur within
the therapeutic dosing range (as determined from literature or pilot data),
 then sponsors may need to submit data both on
both the free and total drug concentrations for the generic and pioneer products.
 
 <P>
 Similarly, if the drug is known to enter blood erythrocytes, the protocol
should address the issue of potential nonlinearity in erythrocyte uptake of the
drug  administered within the labeled therapeutic dosing range.  <P>
 The bioequivalence protocol or completed study report should provide any
information available from the literature regarding erythrocyte uptake and
protein binding characteristics of the drug or drug class, including the
magnitude of protein binding and the type of blood protein to which it
binds.<P>
 <li> Subject Number   <P>
Pilot studies are recommended as a means of estimating the appropriate sample
size for the pivotal bioequivalence study.  Estimated sample size will vary
depending upon whether the data are analyzed on a log or linear scale.  Useful
references for sample size estimates include Westlake<b>4</b>,
Hauschke<b>5,</b> and Steinijans.<b>6</b><P>
 <li> Cross-over and Parallel Design Considerations   <P>
A two-period cross-over design is commonly used in blood level studies.  The
use of cross-over designs eliminates a major source of study variability:
between subject differences in the rates of drug absorption, drug clearance,
and the volume of drug distribution.  <P>
In a typical two-period cross-over design, subjects are randomly assigned to
either sequence A or sequence B with the restriction that equal numbers of
subjects are initially assigned to each sequence.  The design is as follows:
 
 
<pre>
 
                 Sequence A      Sequence B 
   _________________________________________       
   Period 1      Test            Reference
   Period 2      Reference       Test 
</pre>
A crucial assumption in the two-period cross-over 
design is that of equal residual effects.  Unequal residual effects may result,
for example, from an inadequate washout period.  Another assumption of the
cross-over (or extended period) design is that there is no subject by
formulation interaction.  In other words, the assumption is that all subjects
are from a relatively homogeneous population and will exhibit similar relative
bioavailability of the test and reference products.  If there are
subpopulations of subjects, such that the relationship between product
bioavailability is a function of the subpopulation within which they are being
tested, then a subject by formulation interaction is said to exist.  <P>
A one-period parallel design may be preferable in the following situations:<P>
a. The drug induces physiological changes in the animal (e.g., liver microsomal
enzyme induction) which persist after total drug clearance and alter the
bioavailability of the product administered in the second period.<P>
b. The drug has a very long terminal elimination half-life, creating a risk of
residual drug present in the animal at the time of the second period dosing.<P>
c. The duration of the washout time for the two-period cross-over study is so
long as to result in significant maturational changes in the study subjects.<P>
d. The drug follows  delayed or prolonged absorption
(flip-flop kinetics<b>2</b>), where the slope of the
[[beta]]-elimination phase is dictated by the rate of drug absorption rather
than the rate of drug elimination from one or both products.<P>
Other designs, such as the two-period design with four treatment sequences
(Test/Test, Reference/Reference, Test/Reference and Reference/Test) or the
extended period design may be appropriate depending on the circumstances.  The
use of alternative study designs should be discussed with CVM prior to
conducting the bioequivalence study.  Pilot data or literature may
be used in support of alternative study designs.<P>
   <li> Duration of Washout Time for Cross-over Study   <P>
For drugs which follow a one or two compartment open body model, the duration
of the washout time should  
be approximately 10x the plasma apparent terminal elimination half-life, to
provide for 99.9% of the administered dose to be eliminated from the body.<P>
If more highly complex kinetic models are anticipated (<i>e.g</i>., drugs for
which long withdrawal times have been assigned due to prolonged tissue
binding), or for drugs  with the potential for physiologic carryover effects,
the washout time should be adjusted accordingly.<P>

The washout period should be sufficiently long to allow the second period of the 
cross-over study to be applicable in the statistical analysis.  However, if
sequence effects are noted, the data from the first period may be evaluated as a
parallel design study.
   <li> Pivotal Parameters for Blood Level Bioequivalence   <P>
The sponsor is encouraged to calculate parameters using formulas which involve
only the raw data (<i>i.e.</i>, so-called model independent methods). 
 <P>
 a. Area Under the Curve (AUC) Estimates<P>
 The extent of product bioavailability is estimated by the area under the blood
concentration <i>vs</i> time curve (AUC).  AUC is most frequently estimated
using the linear trapezoidal rule.  Other methods for AUC estimation may be
proposed by the sponsor 
and should be accompanied by appropriate literature references 
during protocol development.<P>
  
 For a single dose bioequivalence study, AUC should be calculated from time 0
(predose) to the last sampling time associated with quantifiable drug
concentration AUC(0-LOQ).  The comparison of the test and reference
product value for this noninfinity estimate provides the closest approximation of
the measure of uncertainty (variance) and the relative bioavailability 
estimate associated with 
 AUC(0-INF), the full extent of product bioavailability.<b>7</b><P>

 The relative AUC values generally change very little once the absorption of
both products has been  completed.<b>8,9  </b>However, because of the possibility of
multifunctional absorption kinetics, it can not always be determined when the
available drug has been completely absorbed.  Therefore, CVM recommends
extending the duration of sampling until such time that 
AUC(0-LOQ)/AUC(0-INF)
 &#62; &#61; 0.80.  Generally, the sampling times should extend to at least 3
multiples of the drug's apparent terminal elimination half-life, beyond the
time when maximum blood concentrations are achieved.<P>
 AUC(0-INF)should be used to demonstrate that the concentration-time curve can
be quantitated such that AUC(0-LOQ)/AUC(0-INF)  &gt;= 0.80.  
The method for estimating the terminal elimination phase should be described in
the protocol and the final study report. 
The AUC(0-LOQ)/AUC(0-INF) is calculated to determine 
whether AUC(0-LOQ) adequately reflects the extent of absorption.
<P>
The sponsor should consult with CVM if  AUC(0-LOQ)/AUC(0-INF)
is determined 
 to be &lt; 0.80.  If
AUC(0-LOQ)/AUC(0-INF) is &lt;0.80, then a multiple dose 
study to steady state may
be needed to allow an accurate assessment of AUC(0-INF) (where AUC(0-INF) = AUC(0-t) 
at steady state and t is the dosing interval).<P>

 In a multiple dose study, the AUC should be calculated over one complete
dosing interval AUC(0-t).  Under steady state conditions, 
AUC(0-t)
equals the full extent of bioavailability of the individual dose  
AUC(0-INF) assuming linear kinetics.  For drugs which are known to 
follow nonlinear kinetics, the sponsor should consult with
 CVM to determine the appropriate parameters for the bioequivalence determination. 
   <P>
b. Rate of Absorption <P>
   
 The rate of absorption will be estimated by the maximum observed drug
concentration  (CMAX) and the corresponding time to reach this maximum
concentration (TMAX).    <P>
 When conducting a steady-state investigation, data on the minimum drug
concentrations (trough values) observed during a single dosing interval (CMIN) should also be
collected.  Generally, three successive CMIN values should be provided to
verify that steady-state conditions have been achieved.  Although CMIN most frequently 
occurs immediately prior to the next successive dose, situations do occur with CMIN
observed subsequent to dosing.  To determine a steady state concentration, the CMIN
values should be regressed over time and the resultant slope should be tested for 
its difference from zero. 
  <P>
c. Determination of Product Bioequivalence<P>
 Unless otherwise indicated by CVM during the protocol development for a given
application, the pivotal bioequivalence parameters will be CMAX and  
AUC(0-LOQ)
(for a single dose study) or AUC(0-t) (for a multiple dose
study).  To be indicative of product bioequivalence, the pivotal metrics must
be associated with confidence intervals which fall within a set of
acceptability limits (see Statistical Analysis section of this Guidance.  <P>
The sponsor and CVM should agree to the acceptable bounds for the confidence limits
for the particular drug and formulation during protocol development.  
<P>
If studies or literature demonstrate that the pioneer drug product exhibits highly variable
kinetics, then the generic drug sponsor may propose alternatives to the 
generally acceptable bounds for the confidence limits. <p>
 TMAX in single dose studies and CMIN in multiple dose studies will be assessed
by clinical judgment.   </ol>
<P>
<b> <A NAME="threed">  D. Statistical Analysis  </a> </b>
<P>
CVM advocates the use of 90% confidence intervals, as the best available method
for evaluating bioequivalence study data.  Papers by Schuirmann<b>10</b>
and Westlake<b>4 </b>compare various methodologies for assessing drug
product equivalence and describe the confidence interval approach. <P>
The confidence interval approach should be applied to the individual parameters
of interest (<i>e.g.</i>, AUC and CMAX).  The sponsor may use untransformed or
log transformed data.  However, the choice of untransformed or log transformed
data should be made by the sponsor with concurrence by the Center prior to
conducting the study.<P>
  
 A discussion of how the confidence interval approach should be applied
to (normally distributed) data from a two-period crossover design is given
below.  The example uses untransformed data. <P>


If we let  <IMG SRC=xt1.gif  ALT="the mean of X(T1)">
 be the mean for the test drug in period 1,
<IMG SRC=xt2.gif ALT="the mean of X(T2)"> the mean for the test drug in period 2,
 and 
<IMG SRC=xr1.gif ALT="the mean of X(R1)">
and <IMG SRC=xr2.gif ALT="the mean of X(R2)"> 
the respective means for the reference drug, then the
estimates for the drugs averaged over both periods are

(1/2) (the mean of X(R1) plus the mean of X(R2))">

sequence groups usually start with the same number of animals, the number of

 <P>
The procedure of declaring two formulations bioequivalent if the 90% confidence
interval is completely contained in some fixed interval, is statistically
equivalent to performing two one-sided statistical tests (alpha = .05) at
the end-points of the interval. <P>

Consider the following example with L = 3, U = 17, <IMG SRC=xt.gif ALT="the mean of X(T)"> = 110 and
<IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)"> = 100.  By the traditional hypothesis testing approach, the
result would be considered statistically significant since the confidence
interval does not include 0.  Using the confidence interval approach, the entire
confidence interval lies within 17% of <IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)">.  (The lower end of the
confidence interval lies within <IMG SRC=lxr.gif ALT="L/the mean of X(R)"> = 3/100 
= 3% of
<IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)">, while the upper end of the confidence
 interval lies within
<IMG SRC=uxr.gif ALT="U/the mean of X(R)"> = 17/100 = 17% 
of <IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)">. )  If it were determined
by CVM that only differences larger than 20% were biomedically important, then
using the confidence interval approach the results of this study would be
considered adequate to demonstrate bioequivalence.<P>

Now consider an example with L = -4, U = 24, 
<IMG SRC=xt.gif ALT="the mean of X(T)"> = 110 and
<IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)"> = 100.  
In this case, by the traditional hypothesis testing
approach the result would not be considered statistically significant since the
confidence interval includes 0.  However, the confidence interval extends as far
as 24% from <IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)">.  (The lower end of the 
confidence interval lies
within <IMG SRC=lxr.gif ALT="L/the mean of X(R)"> = -4/100 = -4% of 
<IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)">, while the upper
end of the confidence interval extends to <IMG SRC=uxr.gif ALT="U/the mean of X(R)">
 = 24/100 = 24% of
<IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)">.)   If it were determined by 
CVM that only differences larger
than 20% were biomedically important, then the results of this study would be
considered inadequate to demonstrate bioequivalence, since the entire confidence
interval is not within 20% of <IMG SRC=xr.gif ALT="the mean of X(R)">.
<P>
The width of the confidence interval is determined by the within subject variance
(between subject variance for parallel group studies) and the number of subjects
in the study.  In general, the confidence interval for untransformed data should
be 80-120% (the confidence interval should lie within  &#177; 20% of the 
mean of the reference product). 
For logarithmically transformed data, the confidence interval is generally
80-125%.  The sponsor and CVM should determine the acceptable bounds for
confidence limits for the particular drug and formulation during protocol
development.

  PHARMACOLOGIC END-POINT STUDIES 
</a></h3>
<P>
Where the direct measurement of the rate and extent of absorption of the new

<b>
<A NAME="foura">A.
General Design Aspects 
</a></b>
<P>
Typically the design of a pharmacologic end-point study should follow the same
general considerations as the blood level studies.  However, specifics such as
the number of subjects or sampling times will depend on the pharmacologic
end-point monitored.  The parameters to be measured will also depend upon the
pharmacologic end-points and may differ from those used in blood level studies.
As with blood level studies, when pharmacologic end-point studies are used to
demonstrate bioequivalence, a tissue residue study will also be required in
food-producing animals.<P>

<b>
<A NAME="fourb">B. Statistical Analysis  </a></b>
<P>
For parameters which can be measured over time, a time <i>vs</i>&#160; effect
profile is generated, and equivalence is determined with the method of statistical
analysis essentially the same as for the blood level bioequivalence study.

<P>
For pharmacologic effects for which effect <i>vs</i>&#160; time curves can not be 
generated, then alternative procedures for statistical analysis should be discussed 
with CVM prior to conducting the study.

<A NAME="clinic">V.
CLINICAL END-POINT STUDIES  
</a></h3>
 
If measurement of the drug or its metabolites in blood, biological fluids or
tissues is inappropriate or impractical, and there are no appropriate
pharmacologic end-points to monitor (<i>e.g.</i>, most production drugs and
some coccidiostats and anthelmintics), then well-controlled clinical end-point
studies are acceptable for the demonstration of bioequivalence.   <P>

<b>
<A NAME="fivea">A.
General Design Aspects 
</a></b>
<P>
Generally, a parallel group design with three treatment groups should be used.
The groups should be a placebo (or negative)  control, a positive control
(reference/pioneer product) and the test (generic) product.  The purpose of the
placebo (or negative) control is to confirm the sensitivity or validity<b>
</b>of the study. <P>
Dosage(s) approved for the pioneer product should be used in the study.
Dosage(s) should be selected following consultation with CVM and should reflect
consideration for experimental sensitivity and relevance to the common use of
the pioneer product.<P>

<b>
<A NAME="fiveb">B.
Subject Characteristics and Data Collection 
</a></b>
<P>
Studies should generally be conducted using the target animal species, with
consideration for the sex, class, body weight, age, health status, and feeding
and husbandry conditions, as described on the pioneer product labeling.  In
general, the length of time that the study is conducted should be consistent
with the duration of use on the pioneer product labeling. <P>
In general, the response(s) to be measured in a clinical end-point study should
be based upon the labeling claims of the pioneer product and selected in
consultation with CVM.  It may not be necessary to collect data on some
overlapping claims (<i>e.g.</i>, for a production drug which is added at the
same amount per ton of feed for both growth rate and feed efficiency, data from
only one of the two responses need be collected).   <p>

<b>
<A NAME="fivec">C.
Statistical Analysis 
</a></b>
 <p>
When considering sample size, it is important to note that the pen, not the
individual animal, is often the experimental unit. <P>
As with blood level bioequivalence studies, CVM is advocating the use of 90%
confidence intervals as the best method for evaluating clinical end-point
studies.  The bounds for confidence limits (<i>e.g.,</i>  &#177; 20% of the
improvement over placebo [or negative] control) for the particular drug should
be agreed upon with CVM prior to initiation of the study. <P>
The analysis should be used to compare the test product and the reference
product.  In addition, a traditional hypothesis test should be performed
comparing both the test and reference products separately to the placebo (or
negative) control.  The hypothesis test is conducted to ensure that the study
has adequate sensitivity to detect differences when they actually occur.  If no
significant improvement (alpha = .05) is seen in the parameter
(<i>i.e.</i>, the mean of the test and the mean of the reference products are
each not significantly better than the mean of the placebo [or negative]
control), generally, the study will be considered inadequate to evaluate
bioequivalence.  Assuming that the test and reference products have been shown
to be superior to the placebo (or negative) control, the determination of
bioequivalence is based upon the confidence interval of the difference between
the two products. <P>
In some clinical end-point studies, the requirement for a placebo (or negative)
control may be waived for ethical and/or practical considerations.  If such a
waiver is granted, then the response(s) to the test and reference products
should each provide a statistically significant improvement over baseline.<P>
If the results are ordered categorical data (<i>e.g.</i>, excellent, good, fair
or poor), a non-parametric hypothesis test of no difference between test
product and placebo (or negative) control and between the reference product and
placebo (or negative) control should be performed.  As above, if these tests
result in significant differences between the test product and control and the
reference product and control, then a non-parametric confidence interval on the
difference between the test and reference products is calculated. <P>
Another acceptable approach for categorical data is to calculate the confidence
interval on the odds ratio between the test and reference products after
showing that the test and reference products are significantly better than the
control.<b>11</b>

 HUMAN FOOD SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
</a></h3>
 
The toxicology and tolerance developed for the pioneer animal drug are applied
to generic copies of the drug.<P>
  
The Panel on Human Food Safety at the 1993 Veterinary Drug Bioequivalence Workshop
addressed tissue residue depletion studies for generic animals drugs.<b>1</b>  
The Center has concluded that in addition to a bioequivalence study, a tissue residue
depletion study should be conducted for approval of a generic animal drug product in a 
food-producing species. Two drug products may have the same plasma disposition
profile at the concentrations used to assess product bioequivalence, but may
have very different tissue disposition kinetics when followed out to the
withdrawal time for the pioneer product.  Therefore, to show the withdrawal
period at which residues of the generic product will be consistent with the
tolerance for the pioneer product, a tissue residue depletion study is
necessary.<P>
The results of a bioequivalence study or tissue residue depletion study in one
animal species can not generally be extrapolated to another species.  Possible
species differences in drug partitioning or binding in tissues could magnify a
small difference in the rate or extent of drug absorbed into a large difference
in marker residue concentrations in the target tissue.  Therefore, for a
pioneer product labeled for more than one food-producing species, a
bioequivalence study and a tissue residue depletion study would be required for
each major food-producing species on the label.<P>
 
  A traditional withdrawal study, as described in CVM's "General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing
Animals," September 1986, is considered the best design for collecting data
useful for the calculation of a preslaughter withdrawal period for drugs used
in food-producing animals.  In the traditional withdrawal study, twenty animals
are divided into four or five groups of four to five animals each.  Groups of
animals are slaughtered at carefully preselected time points following the last
administration of the test product and the edible tissues are collected for
residue analysis.  A statistical tolerance limit approach is used to determine
when, with 95% confidence, 99% of treated animals would have tissue residues
below the codified limits.  <P>
For purposes of calculating a withdrawal period for a generic animal drug, only
the generic product would be tested (i.e., not the pioneer product), and only
the marker residue in the target tissue would be analyzed.  <P>
Other study designs will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Sponsors are
encouraged to submit the proposed tissue residue depletion protocol for CVM
concurrence before proceeding with the withdrawal study.<P>
The generic animal drug will be assigned the withdrawal time supported by the
residue depletion data, or the withdrawal  time currently assigned to the
pioneer product, whichever is the longer.  <P>
The generic animal drug sponsor may request a shorter withdrawal period for the
generic product by supplementing the ANADA and providing tissue residue data
necessary to support the shorter withdrawal period request.  Such a supplement
will be reviewed under the agency's policy for Category II supplements.  For a
Category II supplement, a reevaluation of the safety (or effectiveness) data in
the parent application (<i>i.e.</i>, the pioneer NADA) may be required.  The
Center will ordinarily approve a request for a shorter withdrawal period when
the residue data are adequate <i>and</i>&#160; when no other human food safety
concerns for the drug are evident.<P>
Certain drug products may be exempt from the requirement to conduct a tissue
residue depletion study.  Exemptions include products for which a waiver of
<i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing is granted, and products for which the
assay method used in the blood level bioequivalence study is sensitive enough
to measure blood levels of the drug for the entire withdrawal period assigned
to the reference product.  Other requests for waiver of the tissue residue
study will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<P>
 CVM will not require that the assay methodology used to determine the
withdrawal period for the generic product be more rigorous than the approved 
methodology used to 
determine the existing withdrawal period for the pioneer product. 
If an analytical method other than the approved method of analysis is
used, the generic sponsor must provide data comparing the alternate method to
the approved method.<P>

<IMG SRC="E.gif"><b>ach year, the challenges facing our nation's youth increase, as does our need to provide them with positive solutions, direction, and hope.<p>In recognition of this growing demand, the Beer Institute Community Assistance Fund (BICAF) was created in 1989 to support non-profit organizations involved in preventing youth substance abuse.<p>BICAF is on example of the brewers' commitment to substance abuse prevention among American youth in communities nationwide. Over the years, BICAF has made hundreds of grants to local organizations dedicated to helping young people and their families make responsible decisions, particularly with regard to alcohol abuse. These programs have had a positive impact.<p>BICAF's mission is to reduce, and eventually eliminate, substance abuse, especially among the nation's youngest citizens. We believe this program is truly a wise investment in the community and our future.
<p>
The brewing industry has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars in the past decade towards research, education, prevention and responsible drinking programs. Introducing alcohol awareness curricula in schools, broadcasting public service announcements against drunk driving and underage drinking, and funding medical research are examples of the many ways we invest in America, at the national, state, and community level.
<p>
As past efforts have proven, the commitment of every citizen -- from community, government and industry leaders, to parents, families and youth -- is critical to finding meaningful solutions to problems faced by our youth in neighborhoods across the country.
<p>
Through BICAF and other brewer-sponsored programs, we are doing our part. Together, we can -- and will -- make a difference.

<img src="t.gif" align=left>he brewers of America have, for decades, made tremendous corporate commitments to improving our environment and reducing solid waste. As a result, we have found innovative solutions to waste reduction and recycling that make our industry second to none in its management of these critical issues.
<p>
For our members, environmental solutions fall into two major areas: source reduction, which reduces the amount of waste produced; and recycling, a recapturing of the containers, materials and other byproducts of the brewing process.
<p>
Below, you will read summaries of the impressive accomplishments of the four largest American brewers in these important areas. Together, we have a proud record of national leadership, of innovation and accomplishment. We believe our record represents the concern and progress demonstrated by many brewers -- both large and small -- throughout the industry.

	<li><A Href="miller.htm">Miller Brewing Company</a>
	<li><A Href="stroh.htm">The Stroh Brewery Company</a>
	
</ul>
None of this progress would be possible without the strong support and assistance of America's beer drinkers, who enjoy our products and use them responsibly. While encouraging the responsible use of our products, we also ask our consumers to help us take care of the planet -- for our generation and those to come -- by participating in our many recycling programs.

Introducing alcohol awareness curricula in schools, broadcasting public service announcements for drivers, and funding medical research are examples of the many ways we accomplish these goals.

Why do we devote such effort and resources to fighting alcohol abuse? Because no reputable business benefits when its products are misused, and because the families affected by alcohol abuse are our friends, our neighbors and our families, too. We are concerned about the communities we live in, and it's in our interest to combat alcohol abuse.

<h2>A Decade of Success In Reducing Alcohol Abuse</h2>
<img src="a.gif" alt="a">lcohol abuse and underage drinking remain very serious challenges, but
significant progress is being made in fighting these problems.<p>
All leading indicators of alcohol abuse, including underage drinking, have shown steady
improvement because of factors, such as the combined education and awareness efforts of
industry, private organizations and government combined with tougher laws and stricter
enforcement.  The declines have been especially dramatic  in underage drinking and drunk
driving.

The second, a 1991 survey by the Roper Organization, focused on 1,066 persons 21-years-old and older. The third, a random sample of 738 persons between the ages of 14 and 20, was conducted by the Roper Organization in late 1991. And the fourth, a weighted national sample of 956 students in grades in grades 7 through 12, was reported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 1991.

<h3>BEER INSTITUTE SUPPORTS CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS TO ROLLBACK THE BEER TAX</h3>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC   Two bills have recently been introduced in Congress to rollback the 1991 federal excise tax increase on America's beer drinkers.  The Republican bill (H.R. 3817) is sponsored by U.S. Representative Phil English (R-PA) along with Reps. Jon Christensen (R-NE) and John Ensign (R-NV).  The Democratic bill (H.R. 3997) is sponsored by Representatives Richard Neal (D-MA) and Robert Matsui (D-CA).  These bills would provide necessary and long overdue tax relief to American beer consumers.  The legislation received high marks from the trade association representing nation's brewers.  "Members of the beer industry believe that the time has come for Congress to repeal the 1991 beer tax increase.  Rolling back the beer tax would be good for the economy, good for American workers and good for American beer drinkers -- who are hard-working, middle-income Americans," stated Raymond J. McGrath, Beer Institute President.
<p>
According to McGrath, rolling back the beer tax would be a good first step in restoring fairness to the tax system.  "After all, the same bill that doubled the beer tax added taxes to certain luxury items, like yachts, private airplanes, expensive jewelry and furs.  All of those luxury taxes have been repealed since 1991.  It just doesn't seem fair to us that beer drinkers should still be paying, while wealthier Americans get the break."
<p>
"Americans are getting nickeled and dimed by the government every time they buy a beer.  Forty-three (43) percent of the cost of every beer is in hidden taxes.  We believe that is too much for American's beer drinkers to bear," McGrath noted.  "As Congress considers providing much needed relief to the middle-class, we want to encourage the House and Senate to roll back the beer tax.  Beer taxes are one of the most regressive of all taxes, hitting lower-income families nearly five times as hard as upper-income families," McGrath continued.
<p>
The 1991 doubling of the beer tax was the largest in history.  One study shows that 60,000 jobs were lost due to decreased sales. But, the Beer Institute noted that most of these jobs could be recovered with a beer tax rollback pointing to a recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill which found that rolling back this tax to the pre-1991 level would actually restore about 50,000 new jobs.
<p>
McGrath continued, "significantly, a beer tax rollback would not come at a high price to the government. Seventy-five percent of a beer tax rollback would be offset by balance sheet improvements from the new jobs which would be created and the improved economy."  The federal government would also continue to collect over $1.5 billion in excise taxes at the pre-1991 level.  Aside from excise taxes, government collects $15 billion in other federal, state and local taxes from the brewing and selling of beer.
<p>
McGrath added, "We urge Congress to rollback the beer tax and let Americans keep the change."

<h2>A Decade of Success In Reducing Alcohol Abuse</h2>
<img src="a.gif" alt="a">lcohol abuse and underage drinking remain very serious challenges, but
significant progress is being made in fighting these problems.<p>
All leading indicators of alcohol abuse, including underage drinking, have shown steady
improvement because of factors, such as the combined education and awareness efforts of
industry, private organizations and government combined with tougher laws and stricter
enforcement.  The declines have been especially dramatic  in underage drinking and drunk
driving.

<font size=2><I>Four recent polls do a good job of measuring public knowledge about alcohol. The first, conducted in 1990 by Survey Design and Analysis for the federal government's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, is based on a random national survey of 2,000 adults. The second, a 1991 survey by the Roper Organization, focused on 1,066 persons 21-years-old and older. The third, a random sample of 738 persons between the ages of 14 and 20, was conducted by the Roper Organization in late 1991. And the fourth, a weighted national sample of 956 students in grades in grades 7 through 12, was reported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 1991.

<IMG SRC="bicaf.gif" align=right><h2>Letter From The Chairman of BICAF</h2>

<hr>	
<IMG SRC="E.gif">ach year, the challenges facing our nation's youth increase, as does our need to provide them with positive solutions, direction, and hope.<p>In recognition of this growing demand, the Beer Institute Community Assistance Fund (BICAF) was created in 1989 to support non-profit organizations involved in preventing youth substance abuse.<p>BICAF is on example of the brewers' commitment to substance abuse prevention among American youth in communities nationwide. Over the years, BICAF has made hundreds of grants to local organizations dedicated to helping young people and their families make responsible decisions, particularly with regard to alcohol abuse. These programs have had a positive impact.<p>BICAF's mission is to reduce, and eventually eliminate, substance abuse, especially among the nation's youngest citizens. We believe this program is truly a wise investment in the community and our future.
<p>
The brewing industry has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars in the past decade towards research, education, prevention and responsible drinking programs. Introducing alcohol awareness curricula in schools, broadcasting public service announcements against drunk driving and underage drinking, and funding medical research are examples of the many ways we invest in America, at the national, state, and community level.
<p>
As past efforts have proven, the commitment of every citizen -- from community, government and industry leaders, to parents, families and youth -- is critical to finding meaningful solutions to problems faced by our youth in neighborhoods across the country.
<p>
Through BICAF and other brewer-sponsored programs, we are doing our part. Together, we can -- and will -- make a difference.
<p>
<I>Raymond J. McGrath</I>

Chairman of the BICAF Board of Directors

<IMG SRC="T.gif">he men and women of the American brewing industry take pride in the products we make. As an industry, as individual brewers, as wholesalers and as private citizens, our highest priority and our greatest challenge is to ensure that our products are always enjoyed responsibly.<p>

Introducing alcohol awareness curricula in schools, broadcasting public service announcements for drivers, and funding medical research are examples of the many ways we accomplish these goals.
<P>
Why do we devote such effort and resources to fighting alcohol abuse? Because no reputable business benefits when its products are misused, and because the families affected by alcohol abuse are our friends, our neighbors and our families, too. We are concerned about the communities we live in, and it's in our interest to combat alcohol abuse.

<h3>Our Commitment To A Clean Environment</h3> 
<p>
<img src="t.gif" align=left>he brewers of America have, for decades, made tremendous corporate commitments to improving our environment and reducing solid waste. As a result, we have found innovative solutions to waste reduction and recycling that make our industry second to none in its management of these critical issues.
<p>
For our members, environmental solutions fall into two major areas: source reduction, which reduces the amount of waste produced; and recycling, a recapturing of the containers, materials and other byproducts of the brewing process.
<p>
Below, you will read summaries of the impressive accomplishments of the four largest American brewers in these important areas. Together, we have a proud record of national leadership, of innovation and accomplishment. We believe our record represents the concern and progress demonstrated by many brewers -- both large and small -- throughout the industry.

	<li><A Href="miller.htm">Miller Brewing Company</a>
	<li><A Href="stroh.htm">The Stroh Brewery Company</a>
	
</ul>
None of this progress would be possible without the strong support and assistance of America's beer drinkers, who enjoy our products and use them responsibly. While encouraging the responsible use of our products, we also ask our consumers to help us take care of the planet -- for our generation and those to come -- by participating in our many recycling programs.

<title>Cooking With Beer</title>
</head><body bgcolor="fffffff">
<img src="beer.gif" align="right">
<CENTER><IMG SRC="TI.GIF"></CENTER><P>
The Beer Institute receives thousands of requests for recipes using that extra-special ingredient, beer. The recipes in this booklet have proven to be the most popular. And as they show, beer cooking can be easy, successful and featured in every course. <p>Because beer is such a satisfying, cooling beverage, many people forget that it is also one of the world's greatest seasoning agents. Used properly, beer turns the most ordinary foods into exceptional party fare, adding an indefinite, subtle quality to a surprising number of desires. <p>In meat cookery, for example, beer is a classic ingredient. Used in place of water as the simmering liquid, it brings out all the richness of the meat and vegetables. The alcohol evaporates in the cooking, leaving only the delicate flavors to intrigue the diner. <p> As a marinade for meat, fish or seafood, it penetrates and tenderizes. In roasting, baking or broiling, beer is used to baste the foods or as an ingredient in the basting sauce to impart a rich, dark color and highlight the gravy. <p>Beer and cheese are perfect companions. The famous Welsh Rarebit is actually nothing more than melted cheese thinned with beer. In modern dips based on cheese or a combination of cheeses, a little beer in the mixture makes them truly outstanding. <p>As a baking liquid, beer is unsurpassed. It adds a lightness and buoyancy to biscuits, pancakes, cakes, and a variety of homemade breads. Experiment with beer as all or part of the liquid in packaged mixes to reconstitute instant or freeze-dried foods. <p>Here are your "Favorite Recipes with Beer" - all extra-special when served with sparkling glasses or mugs of beer.

<h2>Background on the Beer Institute</h2>
</center>
<p>
The Beer Institute was organized in 1986 to represent the brewing industry, and America's 80
million responsible beer drinkers, before Congress, the Administration, and the general public. 
The Institute also promotes responsible consumption and works with wholesalers and retailers to
fight underage drinking and drunk driving.
<p>
Two examples of the Beer Institute's commitment to <a href="../action/edu.htm">community service</a> are the <a href="../action/drive.htm">Safe Holiday
Reminder Series</a>, a national anti-drunk driving public service announcement campaign that is
heard in virtually every market in America, and the <a href="../bicaf/bicaf.htm">Beer Institute Community Assistance Fund</a>, a
charitable fund established to aid local groups in the fight against substance abuse.
<p>
In addition to providing leadership on public policy issues the affect the industry, Beer Institute
plays an important role in representing the interests of a broad coalition of companies, farmers
and workers nationwide.
<p>
The malt beverage industry provides and estimated 900,000 jobs for industry employees,
wholesalers and retailers.  Beyond these workers, the beer industry supports thousands of
farmers, distributors and manufacturers who supply raw materials and transport or who help
package, beer.
<p>
Local, regional, national and international brewers...agricultural interests...manufacturing
companies...all are part of the trade association representing the American brewing industry: the
Beer Institute.

Soledad Enrichment Action, Inc. in Los Angeles, CA</B><p>

Founded in 1972 by mothers in East Los Angeles whose children had been killed because of gang or drug-related activities. The
group encourages parents and youngsters to work hand-in-hand with professionals to confront
the reality of urban challenges. The BICAF grant will help SEA expand their "High Risk Youth
Drug and Alcohol Prevention Program" to 10-12 year-olds at risk of becoming gang members.
<p><B>
The STOP-GAP Theater Company of Santa Ana, CA</B><p>

Is performing an interactive play  -- Under Pressure  -- offering powerful stories drawn from real-life experiences of recovering teen
substance abusers. BICAF funding will allow for four performances primarily for students
grades 5-12, tier families, and adult groups. It has been on tour in Southern California's Los
Angeles and Orange Counties.
<p><B>
VIP-PEERS -- A Substance and Alcohol Intervention Services for the Deaf (SAISD) Program</B><p>

Provides prevention and intervention services to National Technical Institute for the Deaf
(NTID) students and deaf community clients from the sixteen-county area surrounding
Rochester, NY. Now part of an international network, SAISD was the first comprehensive drug
and alcohol prevention program designed for deaf individuals in the U.S. when it was created in
1979.</B>

<tr><td>The Beer Institute receives thousands of requests for recipes using that extra-special ingredient, beer. The recipes in this booklet have proven to be the most popular. And as they show, beer cooking can be easy, successful and featured in every course. <p>Because beer is such a satisfying, cooling beverage, many people forget that it is also one of the world's greatest seasoning agents. Used properly, beer turns the most ordinary foods into exceptional party fare, adding an indefinite, subtle quality to a surprising number of desires. <p>In meat cookery, for example, beer is a classic ingredient. Used in place of water as the simmering liquid, it brings out all the richness of the meat and vegetables. The alcohol evaporates in the cooking, leaving only the delicate flavors to intrigue the diner. <p> As a marinade for meat, fish or seafood, it penetrates and tenderizes. In roasting, baking or broiling, beer is used to baste the foods or as an ingredient in the basting sauce to impart a rich, dark color and highlight the gravy. <p>Beer and cheese are perfect companions. The famous Welsh Rarebit is actually nothing more than melted cheese thinned with beer. In modern dips based on cheese or a combination of cheeses, a little beer in the mixture makes them truly outstanding. <p>As a baking liquid, beer is unsurpassed. It adds a lightness and buoyancy to biscuits, pancakes, cakes, and a variety of homemade breads. Experiment with beer as all or part of the liquid in packaged mixes to reconstitute instant or freeze-dried foods. <p>Here are your "Favorite Recipes with Beer" - all extra-special when served with sparkling glasses or mugs of beer.

<h3>Anheuser-Busch, Inc</h3>

Anheuser-Busch's environmental philosophy is based on the belief that the world we share has been given to us in trust. From the brewing of our beers through the recovery and recycling of our packages, we strive to uphold that trust every day.
<ul>
<li>Anheuser-Busch recycles more than 90 percent of our production byproducts (spent brewers' grains, aluminum cans, corrugated cardboard and beechwood chips). Recycling our beechwood chips, alone, conserves landfill space equivalent to the needs of a town of 14,000 people every year.<p>
<li>Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation is the world's largest recycler of aluminum cans. In 1993, it recycled 585 million pounds of aluminum, conserving enough energy to provide for the residential electrical needs of a city the size of St. Louis, MO for five years.
<p>
<li>Three Anheuser-Busch breweries recover methane from process wastewater, and pipe it back to the breweries for boiler fuel. These "bioenergy recovery systems" conserve hundreds of millions of cubic feet of natural gas annually.<p>

<li>Anheuser-Busch has made its beer packaging significantly lighter -- while keeping its strength  -- over the past two decades. We've reduced the weight of aluminum cans by 30 percent and glass bottles by 25 percent. The recent reduction of can lid diameter by 1/8" conserves more than 21 million pounds of aluminum a year.<p>

<li>Anheuser-Busch works to preserve the environment in communities throughout the nation by supporting programs such as Operation Brightside, Save the Chesapeake Bay, and the Parks and Wildlife Foundation of Texas.<p>

<h3>Coors Brewing Company</h3>

Adolph Coors Company has a long tradition of conserving our natural resources and minimizing environmental impact. Over the past 40 years, several pioneering efforts have produced significant achievements.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1959, Coors became the first company in the United States to manufacture aluminum beverage containers for commercial use. This was the result of a five year, $10 million research and development effort by Coors.<p>
<li>Also in 1959, Coors established the country's first aluminum can recycling effort by offering one penny for each used can returned by our customers.<p>
<li>In 1992, for the second time in three years, Coors exceeded a 100 percent can recovery rate when Golden Aluminum Company (GAC) recycled more that the four billion cans produced by the brewing company. (GAC was a subsidiary of Adolph Coors Company in 1992.)<p>
<li>In 1992, Coors was the nation's only brewer, and one of only 29 Fortune 500 companies, to accept and meet the CONEG Challenge issued by the Conference of Northeastern Governors. To meet the challenge, companies must achieve specific objectives in packaging to reduce the volume of waste and materials flowing to landfills.<p>
<li>In 1992, Coors Glass Manufacturing collected 51,429 tons of post-consumer recycled glass to make new beer bottles, more than tripling the 1989 total.<p>

<h3>Miller Brewing Company</h3>

When he founded the Miller Brewing Company in 1855, Frederick Miller began an enduring tradition of environmental stewardship. Today, Miller is very proud of its commitment and the results that have ensued.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1989, Miller set an ambitious goal to eliminate nearly all waste shipment to landfill by 1995. Due to enormous dedication by plant employees, Miller has already experienced a cumulative decline of shipments to landfill of 72 percent.<p>
<li>To divert resources from landfills, Miller created a box-reuse program, reducing its need for corrugated cardboard boxes by 75 percent. By reusing shipping cartons, this effort diverted more than 9.5 million pounds of corrugated cardboard out of the waste stream in one year alone.<p>
<li>Miller implemented a byproduct development program which reclaims material to be marketed to other outlets, thus diverting resources from landfill. Grain byproducts, such as Barley's Best, brewers yeast, and grains are sold to farmers and commercial bakeries for use in soups and frozen entrees.<p>
<li>Since 1961, Miller has reduced the amount of aluminum in its cans by 45 percent, creating a savings of more than 100 million pounds of aluminum each year. Nearly 100 percent of Miller's aluminum cans are now made from recycled materials.<p>
<li>New technology has allowed the reduction of weight of glass in our bottles by over 20 percent since 1986. Recycled glass now accounts for more than 30 percent of the materials used to make new bottles, saving more than 8,400 tons of glass each month.<p>

<h3>The Stroh Brewery Company</h3>
Under the leadership of Chairman Peter W. Stroh and his family, The Stroh Brewery Company has built a strong record of environmental conservation based on a true concern for nature. For more than three decades, Stroh has committed immeasurable resources to finding new ways of recycling, reducing waste and reusing materials in a genuine effort to protect our environment.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1987, Stroh developed and pioneered the use of the 204-end can, a revolutionary design that reduced the overall amount of aluminum used in can production. In the last five years, this technology, along with other manufacturing improvements, has reduced Stroh's aluminum usage by 76,000,000 pounds.<p>
<li>Stroh has worked closely with its suppliers of corrugated cardboard boxes to reduce waste.  Currently 30 to 50 percent of the corrugated boxes Stroh uses are made of recycled contents, which reduces the use of new materials and helps increase overall demand for recycled products.<p>
<li>Stroh has also taken advantage of new technology to reduce the weight of glass bottles. Lighter weight bottles reduce the use of manufacturing materials and transportation fuel usage as well.<p>
<li>Stroh has joined forces with resource recovery companies to produce animal bedding from returnable fiber cases. At Stroh's St. Paul plant alone, more than 90 percent of its cases are shredded and used by Minnesota farmers.<p>
<li>As part of its material reuse philosophy, Stroh has found yet another way to be kind to nature and eliminate waste at the same time. Spent grains from the brewing process are used across the country as high-protein livestock feed.<p>

advertising and marketing of beer. They provide guidance which helps brewers maintain the
highest ethical standards in their advertising. The brewing industry first developed voluntary
guidelines on advertising in the 1950s. over the years, the industry has periodically revised and
updated these guidelines, most recently in 1992.
<p>
<li><B>Television and Radio PSAs</B>
<p>
Beer Institute, NBWA and individual brewers each produce radio, television, print ads, and
public service announcements concerning ways to fight dunk driving and underage drinking, and
to promote personal responsibility among adults who chose to drink.
<p>
<li><B>"Know When To Say When", "Think When You Drink", "Drink Safely", "Drink Smart or
Don't Start", Now, Not Now"' and "If You Don't Say No"</B>
<p>
These consumer awareness campaigns help fight drunk driving and underage drinking, and
promote responsible consumption of beer by adults who chose to drink. Included in prime-time
television commercials, movies, billboards, newspaper ads, table displays and/or counter-top
literature, these messages underscore the responsibilities of each individual when choosing to
drink.</ul>

Equalization
</title>

<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="eq.gif"><p>

Some groups contend that "alcohol is alcohol" and that taxes on beer, wine and hard liquor
should be "equalized" - that is, taxed at a rate based solely on alcohol content. Under this scheme,
beer taxes that were already doubled in 1991 would be raised again, from $18.00 to $37.67 per
barrel, or even higher.
<p>
There are many historical, social and economic reasons why America's tax policy was set up to
differentiate between a domestic product - beer - and other types of alcoholic beverages. These
factors should be weighed carefully before our federal tax policy is changed to accommodate the
proponents of equalization.
<p>
<b>
Consider the following points:
</b><p>
<ul>
<li>
Beer is a domestic product that creates <a href="../stats/econ.htm">American Jobs</a>. Raising
beer taxes while leaving liquor untouched would favor a largely foreign-owned industry - which
imports a great deal of its products - over an overwhelmingly domestic industry supporting
almost 2.7 million jobs.
<li>
Any increase in the federal excise tax on beer would have an adverse impact on beer industry
jobs and the approximately 80 million working men and women who consume beer. Close to
31,000 jobs were lost as a result of the beer excise tax in 1991.
<li>
Salaries for employees in beer-related jobs (excluding fringe benefits and pensions) total over
$50 billion. Besides this enormous economic contribution, the industry creates nearly $14 billion
in taxes alone. Higher beer taxes would not only impact U.S. workers, it would affect the
economy.
<li>
Beer taxes are regressive for taxpayers. Today, almost all states, the federal government, and
virtually all developed nations tax alcohol beverages progressively. That is, beverages of weaker
concentration are taxed at a lower rate, per unit of alcohol, than beverages that are highly
concentrated. In fact, when compared in terms of consumer cost-per-ounce of alcohol, beer is
already more expensive than liquor.
<li>
Equalization would unfairly hurt lower- and middle-income consumers and increase the overall
regressivity of the federal income tax system. Compared to liquor, beer purchases are
disproportionately made by people from lower-income families.
<li>
The "alcohol is alcohol" message of equalization proponents conveys that all alcohol beverages
are the same and can be consumed without regard for their alcohol content. This message is
confusing. In the real world, a drink containing hard liquor often has far more alcohol than a
single 12-ounce beer. Telling consumers that they can safely drink martinis or any other mixed
drink the same way they drink beer isn't just wrong, it's dangerous.
</ul>
For over 200 years, America's federal and state tax and regulation policies have recognized beer
as the beverage of moderation and have treated beer, wine and liquor differently. This
recognition of the real differences between beer and liquor should not be ignored or disregarded,
as proponents of equalization would suggest.<p>

With Congress about to consider new taxes to pay for health care reform and other federal
programs, proponents of equalization have already begun to step-up their efforts to increase
federal beer taxes. But careful thought about the historic, social and economic  - and even global
- implications of changing the current tax treatment of beer reveals that such changes would be a
major mistake.  Equating beer and liquor on an alcohol content basis is bad policy, and it would
negatively impact the U.S. beer industry and the 80 million American consumers of beer.<b>

Advertising Warning Legislation
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="warn.gif"><p>America's brewers share a deep concern about excessive and underage drinking associated
with the use of our products.  That's why the beer industry has an unparalleled record of
commitment to combating alcohol abuse, spending tens of millions of dollars annually in
education, research and public service campaigns across the country.  These types of programs
are working.  In fact, every national alcohol abuse indicator has shown significant improvement
over the past decade; many are at the lowest levels ever recorded.
<p>However, studies indicate that another approach, of mandating health warnings on alcohol
advertisements, proposed by U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and U.S. Congressman Joe
Kennedy, D-Mass., would not reduce alcohol abuse among any segment of the population. 
Instead, this legislation (S. 674 and H.R. 1823, respectively) promotes bad policy that would
divert attention and resources from effective programs, like those supported by America's
brewers, to combat abuse.
<p>
<b>Consider the facts:</b>
<ul><li>The <i>advertising</I> of alcohol beverage products does not cause alcohol abuse or
underage drinking.  Contrary to what some believe, there is no evidence to support that link.
<li>Adjusting for inflation, advertising by the brewing industry has doubled since 1974.  Despite
this sizeable increase, per capita consumption has remained essentially stable, and almost every
indicator of abusive and underage drinking has entered a steady period of improvement.  Even
with higher advertising expenditures, fewer young people are drinking illegally and more adults are
drinking responsibly, than every before.
<li>According to both industry and government sponsored polls, there is almost universal
understanding among the general public as to the dangers of excessive use of alcohol.  For
instance, polling research by the Roper Organization show that the public's understanding of the
risks has reached near saturation levels.
<li>The seven rotating warnings contained in the Kennedy/Thurmond proposal provide the public
with no new information.
<li>There is no empirical evidence that warnings would have any effect on the drinking patterns
of Americans of any age, especially among alcohol abusers.  Worse, these types of warnings
could undermine the credibility of other government campaigns to provide information about
serious risks which are not commonly known.
<li>The proposed warnings fail to distinguish between alcohol use and alcohol abuse, and taken
literally, some are inaccurate or misleading.  For instance, people know they can consume a glass
of beer without the dire consequences predicted by such warnings, and warnings which
contradict people's everyday experiences lose all credibility.
<li>These warnings on all beer advertising would add enormous costs and create confusing
messages, thereby compelling brewers to withdraw their broadcast and print advertising support. 
As a result, there would be less resources available for public service campaigns on alcohol
abuse.</ul>
<p>Over 80 million Americans drink beer responsibly.  The six to seven percent of the
population who abuse alcohol will not, or cannot, change their behavior as a result of the
proposed warning messages.
<p>We should not be led to believe that simplistic warnings on alcohol beverages, such as those
proposed by S. 674 and H.R. 1823, will do anything to solve the complex problem of alcohol
abuse.  Personal, not government, intervention is usually required.

Business Advertising Deductibility
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="ad.gif"><p>With Congress and the Clinton administration considering every option for financing
national health care, the issue of new taxation for some or all business advertising is under
consideration.  In fact, some members of Congress already have proposals to reduce or eliminate
this legitimate business expense for selected industries.
<p>The federal government should not use the tax code to punish free speech about lawful
products.  Limiting the tax deduction for advertising expenses is bad tax policy and it is an attack
on commercial free speech protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
<p><b>Consider the following:</b>
<ul><li>Advertising is a touchstone of competitiveness and the lifeblood of American
businesses.  It produces jobs, brings new companies into the marketplace, and bolsters consumer
confidence.
<li>Advertising is the most economical means of marketing a product to a mass society.  By
providing information in a cost-effective manner, it helps the economy function smoothly and
helps promote competition and lower prices.  A tax on all advertising would reduce the amount
of advertising and increase the cost to the nation in lost productivity because of added time spent
searching for goods and services.
<li>Recent studies have concluded that advertising eases the introduction of new products and
new enterprises into the marketplace.  If new entrants cannot compete by advertising effectively
and efficiently, they will have a lower probability of success.
<li>Allowing a company to deduct the cost of advertising for products is not a stamp of approval
or endorsement of that product by the government.  But allowing the government to deny tax
deductions for certain businesses invites future retaliation against any product or cause.  Which
product is next?
<li>The Supreme Court consistently has held that any government attempt to suppress protected
expression because of its content is "so plainly illegitimate" as to render any law designed to
achieve it automatically invalid.  (City of Los Angeles v.  Taxpayer for Vincent, 104 U.S. 2118,
2128 (1084)).
<li>Advertising is an ordinary and necessary cost of doing business, similar to rent, office
supplies and employee training, which are permitted to be fully deducted in the current tax
period.  It is not a tax subsidy.
<li>More than advertising is at stake.  With more restrictions on advertising, America's brewers
and others will be forced to look for alternative ways to market their products.  Without their
advertising support, there will be a reduction in the amount of broadcast programming,
newspapers, magazines, and Yellow Pages directories available to the public at little or no cost. 
Public service announcements will also suffer, along with the Americans who benefit from these
messages.
<li>Advertising provides a major contribution to the country's economic and social well-being. 
Alcohol beverage advertising does not increase consumption and does not cause abuse.  Unfair
tax treatment of all or certain types of business advertising hinders the competitive process,
creates bad policy and jeopardizes commercial free speech under the Constitution.

Preventing Alcohol Abuse
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="prevent.gif"><p>America's brewers and wholesalers are deeply involved in the communities in which they do
business. Their long-standing commitment to reducing alcohol misuse is unparalleled. In fact, the
industry alone has spent over $200 million over the past decade to fund research, public safety,
education and prevention campaigns to curb alcohol abuse.
<p>
Here are just a few examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The nation's largest brewers, Anheuser-Busch, Miller, Coors, and Stroh, are involved in a range
of consumer awareness activities designed to help fight drunk driving and underage drinking, and
to promote responsible consumption of beer by adults who chose to drink. Included in
prime-time television commercials, billboards, and newspaper ads, the messages are positive
reminders of the responsibility each individual has when choosing to drink.  Examples include:
"Know When to Say When," "Think When You Drink," "Drink Safely," "Drink Smart or Don't
Start," and "Now, Not Now."
<li>
College Programs: The brewers also participate in and support National Collegiate Alcohol
Awareness Week, the Buddy System and other educational programs designed to help teach
young people about responsible and legal alcohol consumption on America's college campuses.
<li>
Training and Awareness Programs: Working with retailers, brewers and wholesalers sponsor and
promote special holiday, server training, designated driver and taxi programs to promote
awareness and responsible drinking at bars, restaurants, home parties, and social events.
<li>
Safe Holiday Reminder Series: The Beer Institute, the brewers' trade  association, produces and
distributes award-winning radio public service announcements (PSAs) discouraging  drunk
driving for national broadcast  during six major driving holidays annually. The series has won
two Mercury Awards for excellence.
<li>
Beer Institute Community Fund (BICAF): Founded in 1989, BICAF has provided grants of up to
$10,000 to nearly 200 community-based organizations that need support for effective substance
abuse education and prevention programs.
<li>
Television and Radio PSAs: The Beer Institute, in conjunction with the National Association of
Broadcasters (NAB), and the National Beer Wholesalers Association (NBWA) recently produced
two television and one radio 30-second PSAs, geared to parents and teens, to discourage illegal
underage drinking and drunk driving. The "21 Means 21" campaign has received praise and
endorsements from state alcohol beverage regulators and other officials around the country.
<li>
"We I.D."; Together with the NBWA, over one million pocket sized laminated cards were
distributed in 1992 and 1993 to retail employees to assist in detecting fake driver's licenses used
for illegal beer purchases.
<LI>
Point of Sale: To help retailers, the Beer Institute and NBWA teamed up to create and distribute
nearly two million posters and flyers that show the importance of checking for identification to
prevent underage drinking.
<li>
Advertising Codes: Voluntary industry advertising guidelines were developed to help brewers
maintain the highest ethical standards in advertising and marketing their products. First
developed in the 1950's, they were last updated in 1992.
</ul>
While much remains to be done, recent studies indicate that progress is being made in the fight
against alcohol abuse. Virtually every indicator of alcohol abuse has show significant progress
during the past ten years. Underage drinking and drunk driving are on the decline, while
awareness about problems associated with abuse has hit near saturation levels.
<p>
Whether it is a server training programs, free cab rides, parent-to-child discussion guides on
drinking and driving, or high-visibility advertising, the beer industry has invested millions to be
part of the solution.

Mandatory Deposits on Beverage Containers
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="bottle.gif"><p>
From coast to coast, federal and state lawmakers are examining a variety of legislative proposals
to achieve our nation's solid waste management goals. While many voluntary programs are
working, another approach - under consideration in Congress since 1972 - calls for a national
forced deposit system on soda, wine cooler and beer containers sold in the U.S.
<p>
America's brewers are proven leaders in the country's effort to protect the environment. The U.S.
brewers created the successful <i>Pitch In!</I> litter campaign of the 1970s, and now the
industry promotes the recycling of millions of glass and aluminum beer containers. With this
experience in mind, the brewers oppose a national forced deposit law because it will impose a
costly, unrealistic burden on American government, industry and consumers - and it won't solve
our nation's growing solid waste problem.
<p>
The brewers - along with most Americans - prefer a comprehensive solution which deals
effectively with this complex public challenge, rather than a forced deposit law that narrowly
targets less than 3 percent of the nation's solid waste. Consider the following:
<ul><li>This legislation (called the "bottle bill") would impose a five- to ten-cent deposit on
consumers who purchase certain beverages, so consumers will have an incentive to return the
containers and get their deposit refunded.

<li>Only nine states now require deposits or redemptions. These states are: California,
Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont. No state
has adopted a deposit system since 1983. In fact, deposit bill and initiatives have been rejected over
2,000 times by different state legislatures and voters in the U.S.

<li>Within those states that have mandatory deposit laws, the average price of beer has increased
by 24 cents to 75 cents per six-pack, over and above the deposit price. Soft drink prices have also
increased. Forced deposit laws impose much higher labor costs on beverage wholesalers and
retailers who must pay workers to handle, sort, store and transport empty beverage  containers.

<li>Today, almost two-thirds of all aluminum cans are recycled, along with over one-third of all
glass bottles. A national forced deposit law would effectively discourage voluntary recycling
efforts because it diverts the most valuable recycling commodities - aluminum cans - away from
the recycler to retailers and wholesalers. As a result, recyclers can't afford to handle less valuable
commodities, which often end up in a landfill instead.

<li>Higher consumer prices - and the inconvenience a deposit law entails - significantly reduce
beverage sales. Studies on the impact of forced deposits in Michigan, New York, Oregon and
Massachusetts show declines in beverage sales of as much as 10 percent.

<li> Declining sales lead to fewer jobs, not only for those who brew beer, but also for workers in
the distribution channels and manufacturers of bottles and cans.

<li> Declining sales also mean the loss of tax revenue in states with forced deposit laws. Some
states have experienced the loss of millions of dollars each year in state and local sales and excise
tax collections on beer and soda beverages.
</ul>
For decades, the nation's brewers have taken the lead in improving our environment and reducing
solid waste.  In fact, we are the largest recyclers of aluminum cans in the world. This has been
accomplished through source reduction, recycling containers, and by developing ways to recycle
many of the by-products of the brewing process.  Along with beer wholesalers, retailers and
others, we support curbside recycling programs in cities and communities across America. These
efforts are aided by over 20 percent of American households in over 6,800 communities who
participate in voluntary programs.
<p>
American's  brewers urge Congress to reject mandatory deposit legislation and to support an
integrated, comprehensive and realistic approach to managing solid waste, one that builds on our
past achievements.

effective way to reach the listening audience, each has a serious message and asks listeners not to
drive drunk and not to ride with a drunk driver.

<h2>Drunk Driving Accidents Are Declining</h2>
<hr><font size=2><ul>
<i>When I took office as Secretary of Transportation two years ago, I set a goal of reducing
alcohol-related traffic fatalities to only 43 percent of total by 1997.
<p>
I'm happy to announce that we've achieved this goal -- two full
years ahead of schedule.  Last year, alcohol-related deaths on our roads were down to 42 percent of the total -- and these deaths continued to drop in spite of continued growth in travel.<p>  
Transportation Secretary Federico Pea</I></ul>
</font><hr><ul>
<img src="o.gif">ne of the most encouraging signs of progress against drunk driving is the reduction in alcohol-related traffic fatalities.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that:
<p><ul><img src="pencil.gif">Traffic fatalities in alcohol-related crashes dropped by 5 percent from 1993
to 1994.  The 16,589 alcohol-related fatalities in 1994 represent a 30 percent reduction from the
23,758 alcohol-related fatalities reported in 1984.<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">The proportions of intoxicated young drivers (with a BAC of .10 or greater)
killed in motor vehicle crashes and of young drivers involved in fatal crashes, have decreased
significantly since 1984.  In both categories the number of drivers 15 to 20 years old who were
intoxicated dropped by almost 60 percent between 1984 and 1994 -- the largest decline of any age
group.
<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">Importantly, of all traffic accidents reported by police, regardless of severity,
only four percent of the drivers involved were reported by police as using alcohol.

Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFFFFF">
<h2>Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers</h2>
<hr>
Although drinking and driving by the average consumer continues to decline, there remains a
small segment of society which seems less affected by education and awareness efforts and
which accounts for a disproportionately large part of alcohol-related fatalities.  A recent study
indicates that the vast majority of drunk driving fatalities are caused by so called "hard core"
drunk drivers who are very resistant to change and who drive at extremely high levels of
intoxication.
<P>
Using U.S. government data, the Traffic Injury Research Foundation found that high-Blood
Alcohol Content (BAC) drivers tend  to be problem drinkers, and they are more likely than other
drivers to have a history of drunk-driving convictions and driver's license suspensions related to
drunk-driving.  Seventy-eight (78) percent of drunk drivers killed in 1988 consumed large
amounts of alcohol -- the equivalent of seven or eight drinks in an hour for a 160-pound person,
reaching blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of .15 percent or above.  In addition, the study
found that:
<UL>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">While the legal limit in most states is .10 percent, half of all drunk
drivers killed had a BAC of .20 percent or above - twice the legal limit.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">Nearly 8,500 high BAC drivers are killed on our nation's roads
each year.  This is nearly one-third of all drivers, <STRONG>drinking or non-drinking</STRONG>, killed in the U.S.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">High-BAC drivers make up only 1 percent of drivers on the road
on weekend nights, but they constitute half of all drivers killed.  They are more than 200 times
likely to be involved in a fatal crash than non-drinking drivers.

Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective
</title>
<body bgcolor="fffffffff">
<h2>Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective</h2>

<img src="e.gif">ducational programs are effective.  Recent polls have demonstrated that fewer consumers are
driving after they drink.  A Gallup Poll conducted for M.A.D.D. in September 1991 found that of
those who drink, over the last couple of years, almost nine in ten (88%) said they have taken
precautions or chosen not to drive when they have been drinking.  And of those who drink
occasionally, but have not changed their behavior over the last couple of years, the most
commonly cited reasons for not changing were that "they don't drink much or drink in
moderation" (59%), or that they already "don't drink and drive."
<p><img src="pie.gif" align="right">

In addition, a Roper survey reported by the Harvard Alcohol Project documents the wide
acceptance -- and strong popularity -- of the designated driver concept in the United States.  An
impressive ninety-three (93) percent of adults felt it was a "good" idea or an "excellent" idea to
use a designated driver in Roper's 1991 survey.
<p>
While the work must continue to fight alcohol abuse, it is clear that past efforts are having the
desired effect.  Many consumers are getting the message and the vast majority are enjoying
alcohol beverages responsibly.  Broad-brush approaches which have no scientific basis or record
of success are not the answer and are highly counter-productive.  Alcohol education programs
and responsible drinking messages are producing success in the fight against alcohol abuse.

<h2>A Decade of Success In Reducing Alcohol Abuse</h2>
<img src="a.gif" alt="a">lcohol abuse and underage drinking remain very serious challenges, but
significant progress is being made in fighting these problems.<p>
All leading indicators of alcohol abuse, including underage drinking, have shown steady
improvement because of factors, such as the combined education and awareness efforts of
industry, private organizations and government combined with tougher laws and stricter
enforcement.  The declines have been especially dramatic  in underage drinking and drunk
driving.

<font size=2><I>Four recent polls do a good job of measuring public knowledge about alcohol. The first, conducted in 1990 by Survey Design and Analysis for the federal government's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, is based on a random national survey of 2,000 adults. The second, a 1991 survey by the Roper Organization, focused on 1,066 persons 21-years-old and older. The third, a random sample of 738 persons between the ages of 14 and 20, was conducted by the Roper Organization in late 1991. And the fourth, a weighted national sample of 956 students in grades in grades 7 through 12, was reported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 1991.

<table border=0 width="80%">
<tr><td>
The Beer Institute was organized in 1986 to represent the brewing industry, and America's 80
million responsible beer drinkers, before Congress, the Administration, and the general public. 
The Institute also promotes responsible consumption and works with wholesalers and retailers to
fight underage drinking and drunk driving.
<p>
Two examples of the Beer Institute's commitment to <a href="../action/edu.htm">community service</a> are the <a href="../action/drive.htm">Safe Holiday
Reminder Series</a>, a national anti-drunk driving public service announcement campaign that is
heard in virtually every market in America, and the <a href="../bicaf/bicaf.htm">Beer Institute Community Assistance Fund</a>, a
charitable fund established to aid local groups in the fight against substance abuse.
<p>
In addition to providing leadership on public policy issues the affect the industry, Beer Institute
plays an important role in representing the interests of a broad coalition of companies, farmers
and workers nationwide.
<p>
The malt beverage industry provides and estimated 900,000 jobs for industry employees,
wholesalers and retailers.  Beyond these workers, the beer industry supports thousands of
farmers, distributors and manufacturers who supply raw materials and transport or who help
package, beer.
<p>
Local, regional, national and international brewers...agricultural interests...manufacturing
companies...all are part of the trade association representing the American brewing industry: the
Beer Institute.

<h2>Underage Drinking is Decreasing</h2>
<p>
<IMG SRC="p.gif" alt="P">olling data indicates that there are fewer underage drinkers, and they are drinking less.  Each year,
for example, the University of Michigan surveys the alcohol consumption trends among the nation's
high school seniors.  The most recent survey demonstrates that America's young people are getting
the message about underage drinking.<p>
<hr>
The percentage of high school seniors classified as "current"
drinkers (had at least one drink within the past 30 days) is <em>down</em> from a peak of 72 percent in 1978
to 51 percent in 1994, a 30 percent decline.<p><IMG SRC=FIGURE1.GIF>
<hr> 

The percentage of seniors who drink alcohol beverages daily (20
or more times in the month before the survey) has <em>declined</em> from a peak of 6.9 percent in 1979 to less
than 2.9 percent 1994, a 58 percent improvement.
<p><IMG SRC="FIG5.GIF">
<hr>
The percentage classified as "heavy" drinkers (had five or more
drinks in a  row in the last two weeks) has <em>declined</em> from a peak of 41.4 percent in 1981 to 28.2
percent in 1994, a 32 percent improvement.

Drunk Driving Accidents Are Declining

<h2>Drunk Driving Accidents Are Declining</h2>
<hr><font size=2><ul>
<i>When I took office as Secretary of Transportation two years ago, I set a goal of reducing
alcohol-related traffic fatalities to only 43 percent of total by 1997.
<p>
I'm happy to announce that we've achieved this goal -- two full
years ahead of schedule.  Last year, alcohol-related deaths on our roads were down to 42 percent of the total -- and these deaths continued to drop in spite of continued growth in travel.<p>  
Transportation Secretary Federico Pea</I></ul>
</font><hr><ul>
<img src="o.gif">ne of the most encouraging signs of progress against drunk driving is the reduction in alcohol-related traffic fatalities.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that:
<p><ul><img src="pencil.gif">Traffic fatalities in alcohol-related crashes dropped by 5 percent from 1993
to 1994.  The 16,589 alcohol-related fatalities in 1994 represent a 30 percent reduction from the
23,758 alcohol-related fatalities reported in 1984.<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">The proportions of intoxicated young drivers (with a BAC of .10 or greater)
killed in motor vehicle crashes and of young drivers involved in fatal crashes, have decreased
significantly since 1984.  In both categories the number of drivers 15 to 20 years old who were
intoxicated dropped by almost 60 percent between 1984 and 1994 -- the largest decline of any age
group.
<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">Importantly, of all traffic accidents reported by police, regardless of severity,
only four percent of the drivers involved were reported by police as using alcohol.

Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers

<h2>Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers</h2>
<hr>
Although drinking and driving by the average consumer continues to decline, there remains a
small segment of society which seems less affected by education and awareness efforts and
which accounts for a disproportionately large part of alcohol-related fatalities.  A recent study
indicates that the vast majority of drunk driving fatalities are caused by so called "hard core"
drunk drivers who are very resistant to change and who drive at extremely high levels of
intoxication.
<P>
Using U.S. government data, the Traffic Injury Research Foundation found that high-Blood
Alcohol Content (BAC) drivers tend  to be problem drinkers, and they are more likely than other
drivers to have a history of drunk-driving convictions and driver's license suspensions related to
drunk-driving.  Seventy-eight (78) percent of drunk drivers killed in 1988 consumed large
amounts of alcohol -- the equivalent of seven or eight drinks in an hour for a 160-pound person,
reaching blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of .15 percent or above.  In addition, the study
found that:
<UL>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">While the legal limit in most states is .10 percent, half of all drunk
drivers killed had a BAC of .20 percent or above - twice the legal limit.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">Nearly 8,500 high BAC drivers are killed on our nation's roads
each year.  This is nearly one-third of all drivers, <STRONG>drinking or non-drinking</STRONG>, killed in the U.S.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">High-BAC drivers make up only 1 percent of drivers on the road
on weekend nights, but they constitute half of all drivers killed.  They are more than 200 times
likely to be involved in a fatal crash than non-drinking drivers.

Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective
</title>
<body bgcolor="fffffffff">
<h2>Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective</h2>

<img src="e.gif">ducational programs are effective.  Recent polls have demonstrated that fewer consumers are driving after they drink.  A Gallup Poll conducted for M.A.D.D. in September 1991 found that of those who drink, over the last couple of years, almost nine in ten (88%) said they have taken precautions or chosen not to drive when they have been drinking.  And of those who drink occasionally, but have not changed their behavior over the last couple of years, the most
commonly cited reasons for not changing were that "they don't drink much or drink in
moderation" (59%), or that they already "don't drink and drive."
<p><img src="pie.gif" align="right">

In addition, a Roper survey reported by the Harvard Alcohol Project documents the wide
acceptance -- and strong popularity -- of the designated driver concept in the United States.  An impressive ninety-three (93) percent of adults felt it was a "good" idea or an "excellent" idea to use a designated driver in Roper's 1991 survey.
<p>
While the work must continue to fight alcohol abuse, it is clear that past efforts are having the desired effect.  Many consumers are getting the message and the vast majority are enjoying
alcohol beverages responsibly.  Broad-brush approaches which have no scientific basis or record
of success are not the answer and are highly counter-productive.  Alcohol education programs
and responsible drinking messages are producing success in the fight against alcohol abuse.

<ul><li><B>Beer Institute Advertising and Marketing Code</B>
<p>
Brewing industry advertising guidelines were developed as a service to those responsible for the
advertising and marketing of beer. They provide guidance which helps brewers maintain the
highest ethical standards in their advertising. The brewing industry first developed voluntary
guidelines on advertising in the 1950s. over the years, the industry has periodically revised and
updated these guidelines, most recently in 1992.
<p>
<li><B>Television and Radio PSAs</B>
<p>
Beer Institute, NBWA and individual brewers each produce radio, television, print ads, and
public service announcements concerning ways to fight dunk driving and underage drinking, and
to promote personal responsibility among adults who chose to drink.
<p>
<li><B>"Know When To Say When", "Think When You Drink", "Drink Safely", "Drink Smart or
Don't Start", Now, Not Now"' and "If You Don't Say No"</B>
<p>
These consumer awareness campaigns help fight drunk driving and underage drinking, and
promote responsible consumption of beer by adults who chose to drink. Included in prime-time
television commercials, movies, billboards, newspaper ads, table displays and/or counter-top
literature, these messages underscore the responsibilities of each individual when choosing to
drink.</ul>

establishments in exchange for being the designated driver in a group and refraining from
drinking on that occasion.
<p>
<li><B>Last Call</B>
<p>
Make your last call a safe ride home. This program is being implemented to help keep drunk
drivers off the road by providing free cab rides home. Last Call informs consumers about
responsible drinking and encourages them to know their limits and leave the driving to someone
else.

<li><B>Safe Boating, Safe Snowmobiling and Friends of Field Programs</B>
<p><a name="SAFE"></a>
Safety tips offered to boaters, snowmobilers, swimmers and hunters are provided through various
pamphlets and educational programs. The safe boating and sportsmen programs encourage
boaters, sportsmen and other recreation enthusiasts to be responsible during all recreational
activities through print advertisements and consumer materials on hypothermia, safety
equipment, distress signals, and responsible drinking. The Steer Clear responsible snowmobiling
public awareness program seeks to reduce snowmobiling accidents by encouraging snowmobile
operators to drive their vehicles with cation and care.
<p>
<li><B>Safe Holiday Reminder Series</B>
<p>
Beer Institute produces and distributes public service announcements to over 2,000 radio stations

<h3>Anheuser-Busch, Inc</h3>

Anheuser-Busch's environmental philosophy is based on the belief that the world we share has been given to us in trust. From the brewing of our beers through the recovery and recycling of our packages, we strive to uphold that trust every day.
<ul>
<li>Anheuser-Busch recycles more than 90 percent of our production byproducts (spent brewers' grains, aluminum cans, corrugated cardboard and beechwood chips). Recycling our beechwood chips, alone, conserves landfill space equivalent to the needs of a town of 14,000 people every year.<p>
<li>Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation is the world's largest recycler of aluminum cans. In 1993, it recycled 585 million pounds of aluminum, conserving enough energy to provide for the residential electrical needs of a city the size of St. Louis, MO for five years.
<p>
<li>Three Anheuser-Busch breweries recover methane from process wastewater, and pipe it back to the breweries for boiler fuel. These "bioenergy recovery systems" conserve hundreds of millions of cubic feet of natural gas annually.<p>

<li>Anheuser-Busch has made its beer packaging significantly lighter -- while keeping its strength  -- over the past two decades. We've reduced the weight of aluminum cans by 30 percent and glass bottles by 25 percent. The recent reduction of can lid diameter by 1/8" conserves more than 21 million pounds of aluminum a year.<p>

<li>Anheuser-Busch works to preserve the environment in communities throughout the nation by supporting programs such as Operation Brightside, Save the Chesapeake Bay, and the Parks and Wildlife Foundation of Texas.<p>

<h3>Coors Brewing Company</h3>

Adolph Coors Company has a long tradition of conserving our natural resources and minimizing environmental impact. Over the past 40 years, several pioneering efforts have produced significant achievements.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1959, Coors became the first company in the United States to manufacture aluminum beverage containers for commercial use. This was the result of a five year, $10 million research and development effort by Coors.<p>
<li>Also in 1959, Coors established the country's first aluminum can recycling effort by offering one penny for each used can returned by our customers.<p>
<li>In 1992, for the second time in three years, Coors exceeded a 100 percent can recovery rate when Golden Aluminum Company (GAC) recycled more that the four billion cans produced by the brewing company. (GAC was a subsidiary of Adolph Coors Company in 1992.)<p>
<li>In 1992, Coors was the nation's only brewer, and one of only 29 Fortune 500 companies, to accept and meet the CONEG Challenge issued by the Conference of Northeastern Governors. To meet the challenge, companies must achieve specific objectives in packaging to reduce the volume of waste and materials flowing to landfills.<p>
<li>In 1992, Coors Glass Manufacturing collected 51,429 tons of post-consumer recycled glass to make new beer bottles, more than tripling the 1989 total.<p>

<h3>Miller Brewing Company</h3>

When he founded the Miller Brewing Company in 1855, Frederick Miller began an enduring tradition of environmental stewardship. Today, Miller is very proud of its commitment and the results that have ensued.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1989, Miller set an ambitious goal to eliminate nearly all waste shipment to landfill by 1995. Due to enormous dedication by plant employees, Miller has already experienced a cumulative decline of shipments to landfill of 72 percent.<p>
<li>To divert resources from landfills, Miller created a box-reuse program, reducing its need for corrugated cardboard boxes by 75 percent. By reusing shipping cartons, this effort diverted more than 9.5 million pounds of corrugated cardboard out of the waste stream in one year alone.<p>
<li>Miller implemented a byproduct development program which reclaims material to be marketed to other outlets, thus diverting resources from landfill. Grain byproducts, such as Barley's Best, brewers yeast, and grains are sold to farmers and commercial bakeries for use in soups and frozen entrees.<p>
<li>Since 1961, Miller has reduced the amount of aluminum in its cans by 45 percent, creating a savings of more than 100 million pounds of aluminum each year. Nearly 100 percent of Miller's aluminum cans are now made from recycled materials.<p>
<li>New technology has allowed the reduction of weight of glass in our bottles by over 20 percent since 1986. Recycled glass now accounts for more than 30 percent of the materials used to make new bottles, saving more than 8,400 tons of glass each month.<p>

<h3>The Stroh Brewery Company</h3>
Under the leadership of Chairman Peter W. Stroh and his family, The Stroh Brewery Company has built a strong record of environmental conservation based on a true concern for nature. For more than three decades, Stroh has committed immeasurable resources to finding new ways of recycling, reducing waste and reusing materials in a genuine effort to protect our environment.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1987, Stroh developed and pioneered the use of the 204-end can, a revolutionary design that reduced the overall amount of aluminum used in can production. In the last five years, this technology, along with other manufacturing improvements, has reduced Stroh's aluminum usage by 76,000,000 pounds.<p>
<li>Stroh has worked closely with its suppliers of corrugated cardboard boxes to reduce waste.  Currently 30 to 50 percent of the corrugated boxes Stroh uses are made of recycled contents, which reduces the use of new materials and helps increase overall demand for recycled products.<p>
<li>Stroh has also taken advantage of new technology to reduce the weight of glass bottles. Lighter weight bottles reduce the use of manufacturing materials and transportation fuel usage as well.<p>
<li>Stroh has joined forces with resource recovery companies to produce animal bedding from returnable fiber cases. At Stroh's St. Paul plant alone, more than 90 percent of its cases are shredded and used by Minnesota farmers.<p>
<li>As part of its material reuse philosophy, Stroh has found yet another way to be kind to nature and eliminate waste at the same time. Spent grains from the brewing process are used across the country as high-protein livestock feed.<p>

Cooking With Beer
</title>

<body bgcolor="FFFFFFFF">



<h3>And, to Complement Your Meal</h3>
<b>Temperature</b>
<p>
Experience shows that most people prefer drinking beer which is chilled to about 40 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit (4 to 6 degrees Celsius). This is when beer tastes most delicious. It's a temperature best obtained by storing beer on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator, away from the freezing section. Once removed from the refrigerator, beer should be served before it warms up. For a large party, beer may be chilled in any large container. Let the ice melt and add cold water. Check water temperature with a thermometer, if available. Just keep your beer cans or bottles in this cold water. 
<p>
<b>Opening and Storing Beer</b>
<p>
Open your cans or bottles with care; be sure not to shake or agitate. Always store beer in a cool, dark place, away from the light. This helps protect the rich body and strength always present in U.S. beers. When chilling, place in the bottom of your refrigerator, away from your freezing or coldest compartment. Keep a supply there always. 
<p>
Keep bottle openers and can openers in good condition. Faulty openers can cause chipping or cracking of bottles and denting of cans. 
<p>
<b>Serving</b>
<p>
There are many ways to serve beer. Beer gives an added pleasure when served from a glass or mug. The tall tapering pilsner and the graceful hollow-stemmed goblet are especially popular glasses for entertaining, because they lend such a glamourous air to such an inexpensive beverage.
<p>
<b>Glasses</b>
<p>
Beer and ale taste fine when served from many types of glasses-ceramic, glass and pewter mugs all are appropriate. 
<p>
For picnics, paper beer cups are available in many sizes. The fine taste is preserved by the special coating on the cups. For large crowds, it's easier to use these containers. 
<p>
You'll get the best sparkle in your beer when your glasses sparkle. Any trace of grease or soap or lint from a towel will cut down beer enjoyment. Use a soap-free odorless, cleaning agent or a detergent. Baking soda is excellent, too.
<p> 
A clean beer glass is necessary to acquire the proper foam and flavor. If washed properly, there will be no bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. The foam will adhere to the inside of the glass in a ring design. 
<p>
Always rinse glasses thoroughly in clean cool water, preferably running water. Do not dry glasses. Allow to drain freely so air can circulate in them. Another expert tip is to dip the clean glass into cold rinse water before serving. (Try these secrets and you will serve a perfect glass of beer.) 
<p>
<b>Pouring of The Brew</b>
<p>
There's an art in pouring beer. Some people like a high foamy collar; some a short one. You can obtain a fine creamy head by letting the beer splash into the glass. A good way to achieve the foam you desire is to tilt the glass and begin pouring the beer down the side, then straighten the glass and pour into the center. You will quickly learn how to build a high or low head by varying the distance between the can or bottle and the glass. 
<p>
Many experts recommend that you pour beer directly into a glass. They claim you have a better looking glass of beer this way and it's more flavorful. But remember to find your favorite way of pouring beer and stick to it. It's your personal preference that is most important.

<b>Roast of Pork Loin (Stuffed with Fruit)</b>
<p><ul>
<li>1 cup mixed dried fruits
 <LI>1 can or bottle (12 ozs.) beer
 <LI>4 to 4 1/2 pounds boned loin of pork, center cut
 <LI>salt freshly ground black pepper
 <LI>2 tablespoons butter or margarine
 <LI>2 tablespoons vegetable oil
 <LI>2 tablespoons red currant jelly
 <LI>2 tablespoons flour 
</ul>
Remove pits from prunes. Cut large pieces of fruit into 1-inch pieces. Place fruit in saucepan; cover with cold beer and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let fruit soak in the beer for 30 minutes. Drain fruit on paper towels, reserving beer, set aside. Make a pocket in the pork by cutting a deep slit down the length of the loin, going to within -inch of the two ends and to within 1-inch of the other side. Season the pocket lightly with salt and pepper and stuff it with the fruit. Skewer opening closed. Tie with string at 1-inch intervals.
<p> 
In large roasting pan, melt butter and oil over moderate heat. Brown loin evenly on all sides, about 20 minutes. Remove all fat from pan. Pour in reserved beer; bring to a simmer on top of the stove. Bake in 350 degree oven, covered 1 l/2 hours or until meat is well done. Remove loin to platter. Skim fat from liquid in pan, bring liquid to a boil. When it has reduced to about 2 cups, stir in currant jelly. Blend flour with a little cold water; stir into sauce. Simmer, stirring until sauce is smooth. Taste for seasoning. Carve meat into 1-inch slices. Garnish with watercress, if desired. Pass sauce separately.<p>

<h3>Basting Sauces</h3>
<hr>
<b>Beer Barbecue Sauce</b><p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>1 14-16 pound fresh ham
 <LI>2 cans beer
 <LI>1/2 cup brown sugar
 <LI>1 cup water plus
 <LI>1/2 cup wine vinegar
 <LI>1 teaspoon mustard seed
 <LI>1/2 teaspoon cracked pepper
 <LI>l/2 teaspoon celery seed
</ul>

<h3>And, to Complement Your Meal</h3>
<b>Temperature</b>
<p>
Experience shows that most people prefer drinking beer which is chilled to about 40 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit (4 to 6 degrees Celsius). This is when beer tastes most delicious. It's a temperature best obtained by storing beer on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator, away from the freezing section. Once removed from the refrigerator, beer should be served before it warms up. For a large party, beer may be chilled in any large container. Let the ice melt and add cold water. Check water temperature with a thermometer, if available. Just keep your beer cans or bottles in this cold water. 
<p>
<b>Opening and Storing Beer</b>
<p>
Open your cans or bottles with care; be sure not to shake or agitate. Always store beer in a cool, dark place, away from the light. This helps protect the rich body and strength always present in U.S. beers. When chilling, place in the bottom of your refrigerator, away from your freezing or coldest compartment. Keep a supply there always. 
<p>
Keep bottle openers and can openers in good condition. Faulty openers can cause chipping or cracking of bottles and denting of cans. 
<p>
<b>Serving</b>
<p>
There are many ways to serve beer. Beer gives an added pleasure when served from a glass or mug. The tall tapering pilsner and the graceful hollow-stemmed goblet are especially popular glasses for entertaining, because they lend such a glamourous air to such an inexpensive beverage.
<p>
<b>Glasses</b>
<p>
Beer and ale taste fine when served from many types of glasses-ceramic, glass and pewter mugs all are appropriate. 
<p>
For picnics, paper beer cups are available in many sizes. The fine taste is preserved by the special coating on the cups. For large crowds, it's easier to use these containers. 
<p>
You'll get the best sparkle in your beer when your glasses sparkle. Any trace of grease or soap or lint from a towel will cut down beer enjoyment. Use a soap-free odorless, cleaning agent or a detergent. Baking soda is excellent, too.
<p> 
A clean beer glass is necessary to acquire the proper foam and flavor. If washed properly, there will be no bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. The foam will adhere to the inside of the glass in a ring design. 
<p>
Always rinse glasses thoroughly in clean cool water, preferably running water. Do not dry glasses. Allow to drain freely so air can circulate in them. Another expert tip is to dip the clean glass into cold rinse water before serving. (Try these secrets and you will serve a perfect glass of beer.) 
<p>
<b>Pouring of The Brew</b>
<p>
There's an art in pouring beer. Some people like a high foamy collar; some a short one. You can obtain a fine creamy head by letting the beer splash into the glass. A good way to achieve the foam you desire is to tilt the glass and begin pouring the beer down the side, then straighten the glass and pour into the center. You will quickly learn how to build a high or low head by varying the distance between the can or bottle and the glass. 
<p>
Many experts recommend that you pour beer directly into a glass. They claim you have a better looking glass of beer this way and it's more flavorful. But remember to find your favorite way of pouring beer and stick to it. It's your personal preference that is most important.  </td></tr>

<h2>Underage Drinking is Decreasing</h2>
<p>
<IMG SRC="p.gif" alt="P">olling data indicates that there are fewer underage drinkers, and they are drinking less.  Each year,
for example, the University of Michigan surveys the alcohol consumption trends among the nation's
high school seniors.  The most recent survey demonstrates that America's young people are getting
the message about underage drinking.<p>
<hr><table border=0>
<tr><td valign=center>
The percentage of high school seniors classified as "current"
drinkers (had at least one drink within the past 30 days) is <em>down</em> from a peak of 72 percent in 1978
to 51 percent in 1994, a 30 percent decline.</td><td valign=center><IMG SRC=FIGURE1.GIF></td></tr></table><hr> 

<table border=0>

The percentage of seniors who drink alcohol beverages daily (20

<h2>Drunk Driving Accidents Are Declining</h2>
<hr><font size=2><ul>
<i>When I took office as Secretary of Transportation two years ago, I set a goal of reducing
alcohol-related traffic fatalities to only 43 percent of total by 1997.
<p>
I'm happy to announce that we've achieved this goal -- two full
years ahead of schedule.  Last year, alcohol-related deaths on our roads were down to 42 percent of the total -- and these deaths continued to drop in spite of continued growth in travel.<p>  
Transportation Secretary Federico Pea</I></ul>
</font><hr><ul>
<img src="o.gif">ne of the most encouraging signs of progress against drunk driving is the reduction in alcohol-related traffic fatalities.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that:
<p><ul><img src="pencil.gif">Traffic fatalities in alcohol-related crashes dropped by 5 percent from 1993
to 1994.  The 16,589 alcohol-related fatalities in 1994 represent a 30 percent reduction from the
23,758 alcohol-related fatalities reported in 1984.<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">The proportions of intoxicated young drivers (with a BAC of .10 or greater)
killed in motor vehicle crashes and of young drivers involved in fatal crashes, have decreased
significantly since 1984.  In both categories the number of drivers 15 to 20 years old who were
intoxicated dropped by almost 60 percent between 1984 and 1994 -- the largest decline of any age
group.
<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">Importantly, of all traffic accidents reported by police, regardless of severity,
only four percent of the drivers involved were reported by police as using alcohol.

Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers

<h2>Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers</h2>
<hr>
Although drinking and driving by the average consumer continues to decline, there remains a
small segment of society which seems less affected by education and awareness efforts and
which accounts for a disproportionately large part of alcohol-related fatalities.  A recent study
indicates that the vast majority of drunk driving fatalities are caused by so called "hard core"
drunk drivers who are very resistant to change and who drive at extremely high levels of
intoxication.
<P>
Using U.S. government data, the Traffic Injury Research Foundation found that high-Blood
Alcohol Content (BAC) drivers tend  to be problem drinkers, and they are more likely than other
drivers to have a history of drunk-driving convictions and driver's license suspensions related to
drunk-driving.  Seventy-eight (78) percent of drunk drivers killed in 1988 consumed large
amounts of alcohol -- the equivalent of seven or eight drinks in an hour for a 160-pound person,
reaching blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of .15 percent or above.  In addition, the study
found that:
<UL>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">While the legal limit in most states is .10 percent, half of all drunk
drivers killed had a BAC of .20 percent or above - twice the legal limit.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">Nearly 8,500 high BAC drivers are killed on our nation's roads
each year.  This is nearly one-third of all drivers, <STRONG>drinking or non-drinking</STRONG>, killed in the U.S.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">High-BAC drivers make up only 1 percent of drivers on the road
on weekend nights, but they constitute half of all drivers killed.  They are more than 200 times
likely to be involved in a fatal crash than non-drinking drivers.

Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective
</title>
<body bgcolor="fffffffff">
<h2>Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective</h2>

<img src="e.gif">ducational programs are effective.  Recent polls have demonstrated that fewer consumers are
driving after they drink.  A Gallup Poll conducted for M.A.D.D. in September 1991 found that of
those who drink, over the last couple of years, almost nine in ten (88%) said they have taken
precautions or chosen not to drive when they have been drinking.  And of those who drink
occasionally, but have not changed their behavior over the last couple of years, the most
commonly cited reasons for not changing were that "they don't drink much or drink in
moderation" (59%), or that they already "don't drink and drive."
<p><img src="pie.gif" align="right">

In addition, a Roper survey reported by the Harvard Alcohol Project documents the wide
acceptance -- and strong popularity -- of the designated driver concept in the United States.  An
impressive ninety-three (93) percent of adults felt it was a "good" idea or an "excellent" idea to
use a designated driver in Roper's 1991 survey.
<p>
While the work must continue to fight alcohol abuse, it is clear that past efforts are having the
desired effect.  Many consumers are getting the message and the vast majority are enjoying
alcohol beverages responsibly.  Broad-brush approaches which have no scientific basis or record
of success are not the answer and are highly counter-productive.  Alcohol education programs
and responsible drinking messages are producing success in the fight against alcohol abuse.

Equalization
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="eq.gif"><p>

Some groups contend that "alcohol is alcohol" and that taxes on beer, wine and hard liquor
should be "equalized" - that is, taxed at a rate based solely on alcohol content. Under this scheme,
beer taxes that were already doubled in 1991 would be raised again, from $18.00 to $37.67 per
barrel, or even higher.
<p>
There are many historical, social and economic reasons why America's tax policy was set up to
differentiate between a domestic product - beer - and other types of alcoholic beverages. These
factors should be weighed carefully before our federal tax policy is changed to accommodate the
proponents of equalization.
<p>
<b>
Consider the following points:
</b><p>
<ul>
<li>
Beer is a domestic product that creates <a href="../stats/econ.htm">American Jobs</a>. Raising
beer taxes while leaving liquor untouched would favor a largely foreign-owned industry - which
imports a great deal of its products - over an overwhelmingly domestic industry supporting
almost 2.7 million jobs.
<li>
Any increase in the federal excise tax on beer would have an adverse impact on beer industry
jobs and the approximately 80 million working men and women who consume beer. Close to
31,000 jobs were lost as a result of the beer excise tax in 1991.
<li>
Salaries for employees in beer-related jobs (excluding fringe benefits and pensions) total over
$50 billion. Besides this enormous economic contribution, the industry creates nearly $14 billion
in taxes alone. Higher beer taxes would not only impact U.S. workers, it would affect the
economy.
<li>
Beer taxes are regressive for taxpayers. Today, almost all states, the federal government, and
virtually all developed nations tax alcohol beverages progressively. That is, beverages of weaker
concentration are taxed at a lower rate, per unit of alcohol, than beverages that are highly
concentrated. In fact, when compared in terms of consumer cost-per-ounce of alcohol, beer is
already more expensive than liquor.
<li>
Equalization would unfairly hurt lower- and middle-income consumers and increase the overall
regressivity of the federal income tax system. Compared to liquor, beer purchases are
disproportionately made by people from lower-income families.
<li>
The "alcohol is alcohol" message of equalization proponents conveys that all alcohol beverages
are the same and can be consumed without regard for their alcohol content. This message is
confusing. In the real world, a drink containing hard liquor often has far more alcohol than a
single 12-ounce beer. Telling consumers that they can safely drink martinis or any other mixed
drink the same way they drink beer isn't just wrong, it's dangerous.
</ul>
For over 200 years, America's federal and state tax and regulation policies have recognized beer
as the beverage of moderation and have treated beer, wine and liquor differently. This
recognition of the real differences between beer and liquor should not be ignored or disregarded,
as proponents of equalization would suggest.<p>

With Congress about to consider new taxes to pay for health care reform and other federal
programs, proponents of equalization have already begun to step-up their efforts to increase
federal beer taxes. But careful thought about the historic, social and economic  - and even global
- implications of changing the current tax treatment of beer reveals that such changes would be a
major mistake.  Equating beer and liquor on an alcohol content basis is bad policy, and it would
negatively impact the U.S. beer industry and the 80 million American consumers of beer.<b>

<title>
Preventing Alcohol Abuse
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="prevent.gif"><p>America's brewers and wholesalers are deeply involved in the communities in which they do
business. Their long-standing commitment to reducing alcohol misuse is unparalleled. In fact, the
industry alone has spent over $200 million over the past decade to fund research, public safety,
education and prevention campaigns to curb alcohol abuse.
<p>
Here are just a few examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The nation's largest brewers, Anheuser-Busch, Miller, Coors, and Stroh, are involved in a range
of consumer awareness activities designed to help fight drunk driving and underage drinking, and
to promote responsible consumption of beer by adults who chose to drink. Included in
prime-time television commercials, billboards, and newspaper ads, the messages are positive
reminders of the responsibility each individual has when choosing to drink.  Examples include:
"Know When to Say When," "Think When You Drink," "Drink Safely," "Drink Smart or Don't
Start," and "Now, Not Now."
<li>
College Programs: The brewers also participate in and support National Collegiate Alcohol
Awareness Week, the Buddy System and other educational programs designed to help teach
young people about responsible and legal alcohol consumption on America's college campuses.
<li>
Training and Awareness Programs: Working with retailers, brewers and wholesalers sponsor and
promote special holiday, server training, designated driver and taxi programs to promote
awareness and responsible drinking at bars, restaurants, home parties, and social events.
<li>
Safe Holiday Reminder Series: The Beer Institute, the brewers' trade  association, produces and
distributes award-winning radio public service announcements (PSAs) discouraging  drunk
driving for national broadcast  during six major driving holidays annually. The series has won
two Mercury Awards for excellence.
<li>
Beer Institute Community Fund (BICAF): Founded in 1989, BICAF has provided grants of up to
$10,000 to nearly 200 community-based organizations that need support for effective substance
abuse education and prevention programs.
<li>
Television and Radio PSAs: The Beer Institute, in conjunction with the National Association of
Broadcasters (NAB), and the National Beer Wholesalers Association (NBWA) recently produced
two television and one radio 30-second PSAs, geared to parents and teens, to discourage illegal
underage drinking and drunk driving. The "21 Means 21" campaign has received praise and
endorsements from state alcohol beverage regulators and other officials around the country.
<li>
"We I.D."; Together with the NBWA, over one million pocket sized laminated cards were
distributed in 1992 and 1993 to retail employees to assist in detecting fake driver's licenses used
for illegal beer purchases.
<LI>
Point of Sale: To help retailers, the Beer Institute and NBWA teamed up to create and distribute
nearly two million posters and flyers that show the importance of checking for identification to
prevent underage drinking.
<li>
Advertising Codes: Voluntary industry advertising guidelines were developed to help brewers
maintain the highest ethical standards in advertising and marketing their products. First
developed in the 1950's, they were last updated in 1992.
</ul>
While much remains to be done, recent studies indicate that progress is being made in the fight
against alcohol abuse. Virtually every indicator of alcohol abuse has show significant progress
during the past ten years. Underage drinking and drunk driving are on the decline, while
awareness about problems associated with abuse has hit near saturation levels.
<p>
Whether it is a server training programs, free cab rides, parent-to-child discussion guides on
drinking and driving, or high-visibility advertising, the beer industry has invested millions to be
part of the solution.

<h2>Drunk Driving Accidents Are Declining</h2>
<hr><font size=2><ul>
<i>When I took office as Secretary of Transportation two years ago, I set a goal of reducing
alcohol-related traffic fatalities to only 43 percent of total by 1997.
<p>
I'm happy to announce that we've achieved this goal -- two full
years ahead of schedule.  Last year, alcohol-related deaths on our roads were down to 42 percent of the total -- and these deaths continued to drop in spite of continued growth in travel.<p>  
Transportation Secretary Federico Pea</I></ul>
</font><hr><ul>
<img src="o.gif">ne of the most encouraging signs of progress against drunk driving is the reduction in alcohol-related traffic fatalities.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that:
<p><ul><img src="pencil.gif">Traffic fatalities in alcohol-related crashes dropped by 5 percent from 1993
to 1994.  The 16,589 alcohol-related fatalities in 1994 represent a 30 percent reduction from the
23,758 alcohol-related fatalities reported in 1984.<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">The proportions of intoxicated young drivers (with a BAC of .10 or greater)
killed in motor vehicle crashes and of young drivers involved in fatal crashes, have decreased
significantly since 1984.  In both categories the number of drivers 15 to 20 years old who were
intoxicated dropped by almost 60 percent between 1984 and 1994 -- the largest decline of any age
group.
<p>
<img src="pencil.gif">Importantly, of all traffic accidents reported by police, regardless of severity,
only four percent of the drivers involved were reported by police as using alcohol.

Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers

<h2>Targeted Enforcement Will Stop Many Remaining Drunk Drivers</h2>
<hr>
Although drinking and driving by the average consumer continues to decline, there remains a
small segment of society which seems less affected by education and awareness efforts and
which accounts for a disproportionately large part of alcohol-related fatalities.  A recent study
indicates that the vast majority of drunk driving fatalities are caused by so called "hard core"
drunk drivers who are very resistant to change and who drive at extremely high levels of
intoxication.
<P>
Using U.S. government data, the Traffic Injury Research Foundation found that high-Blood
Alcohol Content (BAC) drivers tend  to be problem drinkers, and they are more likely than other
drivers to have a history of drunk-driving convictions and driver's license suspensions related to
drunk-driving.  Seventy-eight (78) percent of drunk drivers killed in 1988 consumed large
amounts of alcohol -- the equivalent of seven or eight drinks in an hour for a 160-pound person,
reaching blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of .15 percent or above.  In addition, the study
found that:
<UL>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">While the legal limit in most states is .10 percent, half of all drunk
drivers killed had a BAC of .20 percent or above - twice the legal limit.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">Nearly 8,500 high BAC drivers are killed on our nation's roads
each year.  This is nearly one-third of all drivers, <STRONG>drinking or non-drinking</STRONG>, killed in the U.S.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PENCIL.GIF">High-BAC drivers make up only 1 percent of drivers on the road
on weekend nights, but they constitute half of all drivers killed.  They are more than 200 times
likely to be involved in a fatal crash than non-drinking drivers.

Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective
</title>
<body bgcolor="fffffffff">
<h2>Responsible Drinking Messages Are Effective</h2>

<img src="e.gif">ducational programs are effective.  Recent polls have demonstrated that fewer consumers are driving after they drink.  A Gallup Poll conducted for M.A.D.D. in September 1991 found that of those who drink, over the last couple of years, almost nine in ten (88%) said they have taken precautions or chosen not to drive when they have been drinking.  And of those who drink occasionally, but have not changed their behavior over the last couple of years, the most
commonly cited reasons for not changing were that "they don't drink much or drink in
moderation" (59%), or that they already "don't drink and drive."
<p><img src="pie.gif" align="right">

In addition, a Roper survey reported by the Harvard Alcohol Project documents the wide
acceptance -- and strong popularity -- of the designated driver concept in the United States.  An impressive ninety-three (93) percent of adults felt it was a "good" idea or an "excellent" idea to use a designated driver in Roper's 1991 survey.
<p>
While the work must continue to fight alcohol abuse, it is clear that past efforts are having the desired effect.  Many consumers are getting the message and the vast majority are enjoying
alcohol beverages responsibly.  Broad-brush approaches which have no scientific basis or record
of success are not the answer and are highly counter-productive.  Alcohol education programs
and responsible drinking messages are producing success in the fight against alcohol abuse.

Mandatory Deposits on Beverage Containers
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="bottle.gif"><p>
From coast to coast, federal and state lawmakers are examining a variety of legislative proposals
to achieve our nation's solid waste management goals. While many voluntary programs are
working, another approach - under consideration in Congress since 1972 - calls for a national
forced deposit system on soda, wine cooler and beer containers sold in the U.S.
<p>
America's brewers are proven leaders in the country's effort to protect the environment. The U.S.
brewers created the successful <i>Pitch In!</I> litter campaign of the 1970s, and now the
industry promotes the recycling of millions of glass and aluminum beer containers. With this
experience in mind, the brewers oppose a national forced deposit law because it will impose a
costly, unrealistic burden on American government, industry and consumers - and it won't solve
our nation's growing solid waste problem.
<p>
The brewers - along with most Americans - prefer a comprehensive solution which deals
effectively with this complex public challenge, rather than a forced deposit law that narrowly
targets less than 3 percent of the nation's solid waste. Consider the following:
<ul><li>This legislation (called the "bottle bill") would impose a five- to ten-cent deposit on
consumers who purchase certain beverages, so consumers will have an incentive to return the
containers and get their deposit refunded.

<li>Only nine states now require deposits or redemptions. These states are: California,
Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont. No state
has adopted a deposit system since 1983. In fact, deposit bill and initiatives have been rejected over
2,000 times by different state legislatures and voters in the U.S.

<li>Within those states that have mandatory deposit laws, the average price of beer has increased
by 24 cents to 75 cents per six-pack, over and above the deposit price. Soft drink prices have also
increased. Forced deposit laws impose much higher labor costs on beverage wholesalers and
retailers who must pay workers to handle, sort, store and transport empty beverage  containers.

<li>Today, almost two-thirds of all aluminum cans are recycled, along with over one-third of all
glass bottles. A national forced deposit law would effectively discourage voluntary recycling
efforts because it diverts the most valuable recycling commodities - aluminum cans - away from
the recycler to retailers and wholesalers. As a result, recyclers can't afford to handle less valuable
commodities, which often end up in a landfill instead.

<li>Higher consumer prices - and the inconvenience a deposit law entails - significantly reduce
beverage sales. Studies on the impact of forced deposits in Michigan, New York, Oregon and
Massachusetts show declines in beverage sales of as much as 10 percent.

<li> Declining sales lead to fewer jobs, not only for those who brew beer, but also for workers in
the distribution channels and manufacturers of bottles and cans.

<li> Declining sales also mean the loss of tax revenue in states with forced deposit laws. Some
states have experienced the loss of millions of dollars each year in state and local sales and excise
tax collections on beer and soda beverages.
</ul>
For decades, the nation's brewers have taken the lead in improving our environment and reducing
solid waste.  In fact, we are the largest recyclers of aluminum cans in the world. This has been
accomplished through source reduction, recycling containers, and by developing ways to recycle
many of the by-products of the brewing process.  Along with beer wholesalers, retailers and
others, we support curbside recycling programs in cities and communities across America. These
efforts are aided by over 20 percent of American households in over 6,800 communities who
participate in voluntary programs.
<p>
American's  brewers urge Congress to reject mandatory deposit legislation and to support an
integrated, comprehensive and realistic approach to managing solid waste, one that builds on our
past achievements.

Advertising Warning Legislation
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="warn.gif"><p>America's brewers share a deep concern about excessive and underage drinking associated
with the use of our products.  That's why the beer industry has an unparalleled record of
commitment to combating alcohol abuse, spending tens of millions of dollars annually in
education, research and public service campaigns across the country.  These types of programs
are working.  In fact, every national alcohol abuse indicator has shown significant improvement
over the past decade; many are at the lowest levels ever recorded.
<p>However, studies indicate that another approach, of mandating health warnings on alcohol
advertisements, proposed by U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and U.S. Congressman Joe
Kennedy, D-Mass., would not reduce alcohol abuse among any segment of the population. 
Instead, this legislation (S. 674 and H.R. 1823, respectively) promotes bad policy that would
divert attention and resources from effective programs, like those supported by America's
brewers, to combat abuse.
<p>
<b>Consider the facts:</b>
<ul><li>The <i>advertising</I> of alcohol beverage products does not cause alcohol abuse or
underage drinking.  Contrary to what some believe, there is no evidence to support that link.
<li>Adjusting for inflation, advertising by the brewing industry has doubled since 1974.  Despite
this sizeable increase, per capita consumption has remained essentially stable, and almost every
indicator of abusive and underage drinking has entered a steady period of improvement.  Even
with higher advertising expenditures, fewer young people are drinking illegally and more adults are
drinking responsibly, than every before.
<li>According to both industry and government sponsored polls, there is almost universal
understanding among the general public as to the dangers of excessive use of alcohol.  For
instance, polling research by the Roper Organization show that the public's understanding of the
risks has reached near saturation levels.
<li>The seven rotating warnings contained in the Kennedy/Thurmond proposal provide the public
with no new information.
<li>There is no empirical evidence that warnings would have any effect on the drinking patterns
of Americans of any age, especially among alcohol abusers.  Worse, these types of warnings
could undermine the credibility of other government campaigns to provide information about
serious risks which are not commonly known.
<li>The proposed warnings fail to distinguish between alcohol use and alcohol abuse, and taken
literally, some are inaccurate or misleading.  For instance, people know they can consume a glass
of beer without the dire consequences predicted by such warnings, and warnings which
contradict people's everyday experiences lose all credibility.
<li>These warnings on all beer advertising would add enormous costs and create confusing
messages, thereby compelling brewers to withdraw their broadcast and print advertising support. 
As a result, there would be less resources available for public service campaigns on alcohol
abuse.</ul>
<p>Over 80 million Americans drink beer responsibly.  The six to seven percent of the
population who abuse alcohol will not, or cannot, change their behavior as a result of the
proposed warning messages.
<p>We should not be led to believe that simplistic warnings on alcohol beverages, such as those
proposed by S. 674 and H.R. 1823, will do anything to solve the complex problem of alcohol
abuse.  Personal, not government, intervention is usually required.

Business Advertising Deductibility
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffffff"><img src="bilogo.gif"><br>
<img src="ad.gif"><p>With Congress and the Clinton administration considering every option for financing
national health care, the issue of new taxation for some or all business advertising is under
consideration.  In fact, some members of Congress already have proposals to reduce or eliminate
this legitimate business expense for selected industries.
<p>The federal government should not use the tax code to punish free speech about lawful
products.  Limiting the tax deduction for advertising expenses is bad tax policy and it is an attack
on commercial free speech protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
<p><b>Consider the following:</b>
<ul><li>Advertising is a touchstone of competitiveness and the lifeblood of American
businesses.  It produces jobs, brings new companies into the marketplace, and bolsters consumer
confidence.
<li>Advertising is the most economical means of marketing a product to a mass society.  By
providing information in a cost-effective manner, it helps the economy function smoothly and
helps promote competition and lower prices.  A tax on all advertising would reduce the amount
of advertising and increase the cost to the nation in lost productivity because of added time spent
searching for goods and services.
<li>Recent studies have concluded that advertising eases the introduction of new products and
new enterprises into the marketplace.  If new entrants cannot compete by advertising effectively
and efficiently, they will have a lower probability of success.
<li>Allowing a company to deduct the cost of advertising for products is not a stamp of approval
or endorsement of that product by the government.  But allowing the government to deny tax
deductions for certain businesses invites future retaliation against any product or cause.  Which
product is next?
<li>The Supreme Court consistently has held that any government attempt to suppress protected
expression because of its content is "so plainly illegitimate" as to render any law designed to
achieve it automatically invalid.  (City of Los Angeles v.  Taxpayer for Vincent, 104 U.S. 2118,
2128 (1084)).
<li>Advertising is an ordinary and necessary cost of doing business, similar to rent, office
supplies and employee training, which are permitted to be fully deducted in the current tax
period.  It is not a tax subsidy.
<li>More than advertising is at stake.  With more restrictions on advertising, America's brewers
and others will be forced to look for alternative ways to market their products.  Without their
advertising support, there will be a reduction in the amount of broadcast programming,
newspapers, magazines, and Yellow Pages directories available to the public at little or no cost. 
Public service announcements will also suffer, along with the Americans who benefit from these
messages.
<li>Advertising provides a major contribution to the country's economic and social well-being. 
Alcohol beverage advertising does not increase consumption and does not cause abuse.  Unfair
tax treatment of all or certain types of business advertising hinders the competitive process,
creates bad policy and jeopardizes commercial free speech under the Constitution.

<H3>TUANZ Web Page Rationale'</H3>
<P>
 New Zealand is a technologically adept society. As we rush towards
 the Twenty First Century, it is important to keep in mind New
 Zealand's ever increasing role within the world as a whole, not
 only as a technological nation, but as a culturally rich and diverse
 country.
</P>

<P>
 The Internet as a communication medium is playing a more important
 role now within New Zealand and it would seem (from the growth
 factor) that we are embracing this technology with open arms.

<P>
 The technology itself is still relatively limited, for the moment,
 but the implications and the possibilities are as unlimited as
 the imagination itself.
<P>
 Designing for the Internet is a challenge unto itself. Making
 home pages appear as striking and inviting as possible with minimal
 memory is probably one of the most difficult and time consuming
 tasks one could ask of a designer - calling on his/her ability
 as both an artist and as a technical wizard.
<P>
 One of the aspects we felt was most important while designing
 the home page for TUANZ was that the information that was to be
 downloaded was imperative (after all TUANZ is a communications
 association) so the design was to take second place.
<P>
 The design therefore, had to compliment the information and it
 had to be simple, clear, concise and most of all inviting so that
 not only would the interest of people within the telecommunications
 industry be maintained, but stray surfers of the 'net would stop
 by and check it out.
<P>
 The design is clean and it conveys it's information well, the
 3-D logo gives the piece a low-key, yet hi-tech. appearance. The
 information is not overwhelming, (a major player in diverting
 interest) and its appearance is clearly focused.

<PRE>

</PRE>

<H3>Creating a TUANZ web site</H3>
<P>
 The process for creating a full and comprehensive web site for
 TUANZ would involve the following steps:
<UL>
<LI>ask staff and TUANZ members what they would like to have on
 the site
<LI>design a draft site content list based on staff and members
 requests and our own Internet and web building experience
<LI>discuss the draft with staff and members
<LI>create a set of web front pages based on the above discussions
<LI>create forms for updating pages (requires CGI script running
 on web server)
<LI>ask for comment from staff and a select number of members
<LI>re-engineer the TOPICS magazine design process to ensure that
 a HTML copy is supplied by the layout designers
<LI>re-engineer any other paper based production procedure to
 ensure that a HTML copy is made of each &quot;final&quot; version
<LI>teach staff how to update page information using forms
<LI>get agreement from staff to commit time to the updating of
 the pages
<LI>build in the bulk of the content
<LI>trial pages to select number of members
<LI>make adjustments based on comments
<LI>go LIVE! Tell the world!
</UL>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<H3>TUANZ Web Site Structure</H3>
<P>
 The directory structure for the web files should be kept as flat
 as possible to make the job of finding information easier. For
 example:
</P>

<IMG SRC="images/directry.gif" WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=210 BORDER=1>

<P>
 In addition a search engine should be added to the TUANZ Information
 page. This engine should be able to find anything within the TUANZ
 &quot;site&quot;.
<P>
 Other items which may be added to the current list of pages provided
 in the Cookoff information are; What's New - regular users of
 your page will almost always want to find out whatas new on the
 site.

<PRE>

</PRE>

<H3>HTML Requirements</H3>
<P>
 It is recommended that the page be design to make us of some of the features of
 HTML 3. With careful application these elements can be used without reducing the
 page to gibberish when  viewd by an &quot;old&quot; browser. Current market
 trends suggest that the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser may significantly
 challenge the dominance of the Netscape Navigator browser. (Some suggest
 that Netscape has only 18 months to live.) Any design should be compatible with
 both these browsers. Some effort should be made to ensure compatablility with
 HTML 1 browsers.
</P>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<H3>Updating the Pages</H3>
<P>
 A web site which is updated regularly is much more likely to
 attract return users. Therefore is it important that someone be
 given the task of updating the page at least once a week and preferable
 daily.
<P>
 Given the lack of HTML skills in the TUANZ office, and assuming
 that a contract HTMLer is not desired, the simplest way to have
 office staff update pages is by the use of Web forms.
<P>
 These forms can be used to update such pages as: 1.3 Calendar,
 1.4 Events, 1.6 Services Directory, 1.7 Classifieds, 2.1 INZ Activities,
 3.1 InterOp Activities, 4.1 NZEC Activities, 5.1 ATMIG Activities.
 These pages would have a simple page design and be almost completely
 text based.
<P>
 Those other pages which require a higher degree of custom design
 and layout, including graphics should be contracted out to a web
 page design firm. The two pages we have created would not be suitable
 for forms updating. It is not intended that these page would be
 changed at all, except for six monthly design refreshers.

<PRE>

</PRE>

<H3>Future Ideas</H3>

<P>
 As the Web develops over the next 12 months new additions may
 become desirable. For example:
<UL>
<LI>online TUANZ subscriptions
<LI>conduct live Web/VRML based discussions on hot topics
<LI>live video of the TUANZ office
<LI>Send out a TOPICS brief via email
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Tena Koutou. Welcome to the Maori Law Review. 

<H2><HR>What the Review Covers</H2>
<P>
<H3>Maori Land Court</H3>
This court is the successor to the Native Land Court which,
from 1865, operated throughout the country and converted the
customary, and often communal, title of the Maori owners of
New Zealand to an individual
title, so that Maori became owners of undivided shares in
their land as tenants in common.
<P>
The Maori Land Court, and its appellate body, the Maori
Appellate Court, administer land
which remains under this form of title - commonly called
"Maori land" and which consists of
about 1,305,698 hectares or 4.5% of New Zealand's land area.
Title to this multiply-owned land is
often in a fragmented state. The current law for administering
Maori land, Te Ture Whenua
Maori Act 1993 (The Maori Land Act 1993), and the previous law,
the Maori Land Act 1953
provide various mechanisms for the shareholder owners to
reform and manage Maori
land. The chief forms of management are through meetings of
owners, specialist land trusts
and Maori land incorporations.
<P>
Because of the fraction of Maori land remaining, the 1993 Act
has various provisions to ensure
that Maori land remains under multiple ownership unless there
is a clearly expressed wish on
the part of the owners to part with it. The Act gives a first
right of refusal to other owners and
kin where sales of Maori land, or shares in it, are
contemplated. Wills which purport to leave
shares in Maori land outside of certain restricted kin groups
are voided by the Act.
<P>
<B>The Review covers:</B><BR>
- Land Court and Appellate Court decisions of interest<BR>
- Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 and related law; legislative,
regulatory and rule changes
<P>
<H3>Waitangi Tribunal</H3>
Established under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, the
tribunal hears and reports on claims by
Maori that they have been or may be "prejudically affected" by
laws, actions and policies of the
Crown contrary to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.
The Treaty of Waitangi was signed
in 1840. In 1985 the tribunal was given retrospective
jurisdiction to examine Crown actions affecting Maori since
1840.
<P>
The tribunal may have up to 17 members, who sit in divisions
as small as 3, of whom one
member must be Maori. Sittings are usually headed by a member
with legal training or a judge
of the Maori Land Court. The chairperson is the Chief Judge of
the Maori Land Court. 
<P>
The tribunal must report to the government on every claim
received. If it finds the claim to be
well founded and that the principles of the Treaty have been
breached, it has power only to
recommend whatever action might be required to remedy the
breach. There is no restriction on
what may be recommended (including the amendment of
legislation), except that no
recommendation may be made for the return of private land. For
small claims, affecting a sub
tribal group (hapu) or extended family group (whanau)
recommendations are usually specific,
specifying the return of particular lands, or payment of
compensation. For larger claims
affecting whole tribes, there will also usually be a
recommendation to undertake negotiations in
light of the tribunal findings.
<P>
In certain cases, for some forest lands and lands held or
formerly held by state owned
corporations, the tribunal has power to order their return to
Maori where claims are proven.
This potentially affects thousands of hectares of public or
former public land. To date,
the tribunal has not exercised this power.
<P>
The tribunal may not hear claims concerning commercial
fisheries. These claims are presumed
to have been settled by an agreement signed with Maori tribes
in 1992 giving them a substantial
interest in New Zealand commercial fisheries by way of cash,
rights to fisheries quota and
shares in the country's largest fishing company.
<P>
<STRONG>The Review covers:</STRONG><BR>
- Reports<BR>
- Practice notes<BR>
- Directions/memoranda<BR>
<P>
<H3>General Courts and law</H3>
<B>The Review also reports on:</B><BR>
- decisions impacting on Maori land and other resources in the
general courts eg Resource
Management Act (the Planning Tribunal operates under this
Act), Rating Powers Act, Maori fisheries legislation.<BR>
- Law changes in areas impacting on Maori land and other
resource use.
<P>
An index is produced annually.
<P>
<H3>Annotations used in the Review</H3>
This publication has adopted a few special conventions used in
the Maori Land Court and
Appellate Court:<BR>
<PRE>
	MLC  = Maori Land Court
	MAC  = Maori Appellate Court
	MB   = Minute Book
	CJ   = Chief Judge
	ACMB = Appellate Court Minute Book
</PRE>
<P>
Also adopted is the Maori Land Court and Appellate Court
practice to cite sections with the
number followed by a slash and the year of the statute
concerned. Eg s41/1953 = s41 Maori
Affairs Act 1953.
<H3>About the editor</H3>

the Waitangi Tribunal as legal
officer for 5 years and has been an adviser to the Maori Land
Court, Head Office. He now

<H3>December 1994 - January 1995</H3>
<PRE>

</PRE>

<H2>Editorial<HR></H2>
As the year started (see MLR January 1994) so it ended, with discussion about the best means
of achieving
settlements to Treaty claims. Now however, there is up for debate a detailed government
settlement policy, a Labour party
response, and the proposed Tainui deal. Given that the government and opposition parties are
far apart in their approach
to Treaty settlements (the government is interested in a fiscal cap, Labour and the Alliance are
not, the government seems
scarcely interested in the Waitangi Tribunal, Labour wants to boost its resources), perhaps the
determining factor in the
debate will be the practical results from the fisheries settlement assets allocation row, and the
proposed Tainui deal. These
will decide whether full and final settlements, mechanisms for determining tribal representation
and fiscal caps are practical
or not.<P>
The National Government has ensured that one major tribal group has an interest in
supporting its settlement policy
proposals. The agreement signed with Tainui in many of its details follows the proposals.
Other tribes, looking nervously
at the 17% of the fiscal envelope already committed in the Tainui deal, have indicated that
they have many reservations and
questions which will need to be answered. Whether this will be the year of deal-making
remains to be seen.<P>
In the current excitement, it is perhaps worth remembering that, for many Maori,
unemployment will be their greatest
challenge in 1995. The Task Force on Unemployment has suggested a goal which, beside the
Treaty claims debate, seems
relatively modest. It is to have the major political parties, by mid-1995, agree on a
comprehensive strategy to eliminate
Maori disadvantage in the labour market. <P>
<P>
This being a year celebrating Maori language, the Review will be improving it's use of Maori,
including the use of macrons
from the next issue. If the English explanations of Maori terms seem a little obvious at times,
please bear with us, there is
a small but growing international audience for the Review. I would like to record my thanks to
those who helped launch
this publication, in particular the support from the Waitangi Tribunal and from the Judges of
the Maori Land Court.<P>

<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>In Re Tuaropaki E Geothermal Test Wells and the A-G</H3>
<I>(1994) 1 Waiariki Appellate Court B 24, 20 December 1994. Chief Judge Durie, Carter J, 
Savage J </I>
An appeal by the A-G from a final order of the MLC determining ownership of certain
geothermal test wells situated
on Maori land.
Held: the matter should be referred to MLC for a rehearing because the Crown was given
insufficient time to prepare its
case (5 clear working days only). The MLC had wrongly failed to use its discretion to grant an
adjournment, giving
insufficient weight to the capacity of the Crown to prepare for hearing. Further injustice would
result if the MAC did not
intervene (the circumstances in which the MAC will intervene in MLC discretion and matters
to consider in granting an
adjournment were briefly discussed). <P>
Noted that s18(2) and s56(2)/1993 do not give authority for MAC to transfer an unheard
appeal to the High Court. Transfer
of this appeal (now heard) declined in this case.<P>
Also noted that where an application for adjournment is disputed, both parties must be given
an opportunity to hear the
arguments and respond. Finally, s18/1993 extending jurisdiction to claims in contract, tort and
equity, with no monetary
limit, will raise complicated matters such as this case and a more measured and structured
approach to pre-trial matters is
contemplated in s67/1993.<P>

<H3>In Re Ngati Toa Rangatira</H3><BR>
<I>(1994) 21 Nelson MB 1, 8 December 1994. HK Hingston J, T Adams &amp; W
Mauriohooho as additional
members</I><P>
This was an application under s30/1993 to determine, between two competing groups, the
appropriate representatives
of Ngati Toa Rangatira to receive certain fisheries quota, consult with the Malborough District
Council on various matters
and negotiate with the Crown concerning the disposal of surplus Crown lands in the South
Island. A runanga based in the
North Island (Te Runanga O Toa Rangatira Inc) claimed to represent all Ngati Toa and
stressed continuity with the past
tradition of acceptance of North Island leadership. A South Island trust (Ngati Toa Rangatira
Manawhenua ki te Tauihu
Trust) claimed to represent Ngati Toa of the northern South Island (Wairau) region, arguing
that a separate identity for
southern Ngai Tahu had developed over time. 
Held: neither body adequately represented Ngati Toa in traditional terms. Both were of
relatively recent creation, and the
South Island trust represented a community of interests, but not a traditional authority. A
representative body of kaumatua
(elders) were the only appropriate representatives for the present. Accordingly, the hearing
was adjourned to allow the
selection of kaumatua rangatira of Ngati Toa, not currently holding office in either body, 5
from the North Island and 2 from
the South, with terms of appointment limited by the court to three years. <P>
It was also noted that mana moana is not a concept from tikanga Maori but is a construct
"rooted in greed and
ignorance&#34; arising from contemporary fisheries settlements. Mana whenua in Tainui
tikanga (different meanings might
apply for other iwi) refers to "mana-o-te-whenua", a "traditional veto mechanism" whereby
owners gave authority to the
Maori King to veto all offers to purchase the land.
Also held that, in accordance with s66(1)(a)/1993, marae kawa should be followed and
whakapapa should not be read out
before the court.<P>
[ed: on the basis of this and the <I>Tararua</I> decision (138 Napier MB 85, 1 November
1994 see MLR November
1994), where there is conflict over representation, the court seems to be wary of recently
formed organisations lacking
kaumatua involvement. The comments on mana whenua and, more particularly, mana moana,
which seem to attack the heart
of the proposed distribution scheme for the fisheries settlement assets, will almost certainly
generate further discussion. The
decision also made critical comments on the partiality and conduct of a key witness (whether
these will be challenged
remains to be seen).]<P>

<H3>  In Re Karu O Te Whenua B2B5B1 Block</H3><BR>
<I>108 Otorohanga MB 227, 21 November 1994. GD Carter J<P>
</I>This concerned an application for confirmation of a resolution to sell a block which was
objected to by minority
shareholders on several grounds.<P>
Held: the right of first refusal under s152/1993 (and s147(2)) refers to the whole of the land
subject to an application for
confirmation. In this instance it did not provide an opportunity for dissenting owners to have
first preference to buy
individual shares of other owners. The court also noted that if a partition is sought solely to
allow a sale of shares this might
be argued not to have the objective of facilitating the effective operation, development and
utilisation of Maori land as
required by the 1993 Act. However, if dissenting owners to a sale seek a partition to retain
land then ss2 (promoting
retention of land in Maori hands) and 17 (protection of minority interests) apply, and a
partition order may be appropriate.
<P>

<H3>  In Re Oparau No 1 Block</H3><BR>
<I>76 Waikato MB 210, November 1994. GD Carter J<P>
</I>A major shareholder in a block of land administered as an ahu whenua (formerly s438)
trust, because of personal
financial difficulties, entered into an agreement to sell his shareholding to 2 minor shareholders
in the block at a price below
the market value. The shareholder died shortly after entering the agreement. The minor
shareholders sought a vesting order
under s164/1993, which was opposed by the trust and other parties.<P>
Held: under the 1953 precursor to s164 (s213(7)), the court had allowed an alienor to
withdraw at any time prior to a vesting
order being made (see <I>In Re Tikouma 3B2 Whareraumati Development Ltd v Ruha and
Ors</I> (1975) 14
Waikato-Maniapoto ACMB 362, <I>Tai Whati</I> p171). Consent at the time of hearing (not
at the time of making
the agreement) is assessed. Other owners have the right to object to the order (s164(8)).
Section 164(7), which provides that
where a party to an agreement has died the court must be satisfied a "proper agreement" was
reached before death, is new
in the 1993 Act. This can include consideration of extrinsic circumstances relevant to the
agreement. The section does not
necessarily pass the right of withdrawal of the deceased alienor to their successor, but where
questions of adequacy of
consideration arise, the views of any successor on the agreement may be taken into account by
the court. Because adequacy
of consideration was in issue in this case the consent of any successor would be required.
Successors had not yet been determined. The court questioned whether a codicil concerning
the deceased's Maori land
interests made after the 1993 Act came into effect could be affected by s108 (land to be left to
certain preferred classes only), where the will itself, being
executed earlier in time, was not subject to that section. <P>
As to whether under s152 consideration was adequate - although the price was low, the
deceased had legal advice and had
not rushed into the sale. Noted that generally parties without a pecuniary interest in a sale may
not oppose it for inadequacy
of consideration. However, having regard to broader factors, in particular the Preamble and
s2/1993 which suggest group
interests in Maori land should be promoted over individual interests, no vesting order should
be made if the trust was willing
to purchase the shares at the price the deceased had agreed with the minority
shareholders.<P>

<H3> In Re Mahimahi E5 </H3><BR>
<I>(1994) 4 Tokerau ACMB 51, 13 December 1994. Deputy Chief Judge Smith, Marumaru J,
McHugh J<P>
</I>The appellant had filed an application under s240/1993 seeking the removal of 2 trustees
for alleged mismanagement
of a section 438 trust in which he was a trustee. A "mirror" application under the same
section was filed by the 2 trustees
named in the first application, seeking removal of all trustees except themselves. After a
hearing and discussions in chambers
the court noted that both s240 applications were dismissed by agreement. The appellant wrote
to the court arguing that he
had not agreed to the dismissal of his application. The Deputy Registrar advised that the
dismissal could either be appealed,
or the court would accept a fresh application. A fresh application was filed. After a brief
hearing at which neither party
appeared the court dismissed the fresh application saying the matter had already been dealt
with and was <I>res
judicata</I>. The appellant brought the present action arguing that the first dismissal was
made without jurisdiction, and
the second dismissal was in breach of natural justice and court rules and a wrong use of the res
judicata doctrine.
Held: as to the first dismissal, although this had been made after a chambers conference, there
had been a hearing, the court
was prepared to hear the matter further, and s17(2)(c)/1993 (court to facilitate settlement of
disputes) and s66(2)/1993
(avoidance of undue formality) indicate that promoting resolutions through discussion
between parties is desirable, and rule
42(5) (MLC Rules 1994/35), which gives an unfettered discretion to dismiss, could be invoked
in the circumstances (there
being no specific rule for discontinuance of actions as in the High Court). Noted, but not
decided, that rule 70 might also
be invoked where parties consent to a dismissal, since this might amount to "want of proper
jurisdiction" which that
rule specifies. Noted that the court could have adjourned rather than dismissed the
applications and later cleared them from
the court record using rules 79 or 38. The dismissal by the court could not be attacked for
failure to consider the seriousness
of the allegations made since there had been consent from both sides. Noted however that it is
useful if the lower court
records under what provision dismissal is made.<P>
As to the second dismissal, this had been wrongly made without notice to the parties as
required by MLC rules. The lower
court should have treated the appellant's letter to the Deputy Registrar as an application for
rehearing under s43/1993 and
rule 71.<P><H2><HR>  Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3> Allocation of Fisheries Settlement Assets </H3>
<I>Wai 447. Filed on 8 December 1994<P>
</I>The claim is by Rima Edwards and others and groups including Te Runanga o
Muriwhenua, Te Runanga-a-Iwi O Nga
Puhi, Tainui Waka Fisheries, Ngati Ranginui Iwi Society Inc, Te Kotahitanga-o-Te Arawa. It
alleges that the Treaty of
Waitangi Fisheries Commission has promoted the final allocation of fisheries assets and in
particular pre-settlement assets
without considering at all or adequately the matters prerequisite to such a decision
including:<P>
- Identifying the persons or groups beneficially entitled - in particular, how persons from the
1991 census claiming to be
Maori, but not identifying a tribal affiliation, should be provided for;<P>
- Whether Treaty grievances of such beneficiaries will best be addressed by final allocation
or
delayed allocation or no
decision to allocate for now;<P>
- Using a model substantially based on mana moana, which is "manifestly not a tradition
based concept", and which
ignores "large populations of northern tribes whose rights to develop extend to exploitation
of the deep fishery to a
substantial degree in order to provide for their populations".
- Failure to have sufficient regard to the Waitangi Tribunal<I> Fisheries Settlement
</I>report, Wai 307.<P>
It is also alleged that the commission has been biased in promoting one model to the exclusion
of others, and if not topped
will exacerbate Treaty breaches supposed to have been settled by the fisheries agreement and
legislation, and those aggrieved
will have no recourse against the Crown. The claimants seek findings that the mana moana
concept and the consultation
process adopted by the commission are not in accordance with principles of the Treaty. They
ask that the Crown in
consultation with Maori and pursuant to guidelines recommended by the tribunal appoint a
royal or other commission or
other body to inquire into these matters and that in the meantime no allocation should take
place.<P>
[ed: The tribunal, after a preliminary hearing, is preparing a decision on whether it has
jurisdiction to hear the claim, in
particular, whether any actions of the commission are actions of the Crown, whether the
Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries
Claims) Settlement Act 1992 prevents the tribunal from hearing the claim, and whether an
alternative remedy exists in
proceedings before the High Court. In addition to this claim, there are now at least 3 actions in
the High Court concerning
allocation by the commission, with the possibility of more being added. These are:<P>
- Hauraki interests seek a case stated from the High Court to the Maori Appellate Court to
rule on tikanga (customary) issues
along part of their coastline disputed with Tainui (<I>Hauraki Maori Trust Board &amp; Anor
v ToW Fisheries
Commission</I> CP 562/94);<P>
- A Te Arawa group which has already obtained a case stated on tikanga issues from the
High
Court to the Appellate Court,
now faces an injunctive action in the High Court to prevent the Appellate Court proceeding
(<I>Te Waka Hi Ika o Te
Arawa v ToW Fisheries Commission</I> CP 395/93);<P>
- Muriwhenua interests seek to challenge the consultative process by which the commission
is
determining which allocation
model to follow (<I>Te Runanga o Muriwhenua &amp; ors v ToW Fisheries Commission</I>
M 1514/94);<P>
Counsel instructed by 6 commissioners has informed the High Court that they may become
involved in proceedings because
of concerns about the legality of commission decisions, particularly in terms of consultative
processes, and possible
inconsistency with principles of the Treaty (Conference minute 9 December 1994, Anderson J,
High Court Auckland). The
commission does not now expect to report its final allocation model to the Minister of
Fisheries until mid June 1995,
depending on progress with litigation (letter to iwi 10 January 1995).]<P>

</I>An appeal from the judgment of McGechan J in the High Court dismissing an application

in MLR October 1994).<P>
Held: the appeal should be dismissed. Criticisms of the flawed postal delivery of option forms,
and the content of
explanatory material, were "hypercritical". Reasonable steps were taken to notify the
option to Maori voters already
on the electoral rolls. As to Maori voters not enroled, such an important option, affecting the
constitution of the state, of
itself gives rise to an implication that reasonable notice of the option must be given, regardless
of the Treaty of Waitangi
and any special obligations to Maori. Special obligations are relevant however in determining
what is reasonable, given the
position of Maori in NZ society and the unsatisfactory Maori enrolment numbers. Overall,
depite some problems, the option
did receive considerable publicity, and Maori enrolments increased significantly during
publicity campaigns leading up to
and during the option period. While what was done was "far from perfect", it passed the
test of reasonableness. <P>

Privy Council has been filed by the appellants]<P>


<H3>Davis and another v Morgan and another  </H3>
<I>M 51/94 High Court Whangarei, 21 November 1994. Barker J <P>
</I>An application to the MLC to confirm a transfer of land was challenged on the basis of
certain alleged irregularities.
Concurrent proceedings alleging forgery, conflict of interest of the solicitor involved,
inadequate consideration and other
matters were commenced in the High Court. The MLC adjourned its proceedings pending the
High Court determination
(quite rightly in the High Court's view), and questioned whether it had jurisdiction to
determine issues such as forgery and
conflict of interest within the context of an application for confirmation. The High Court was
asked to determine whether
the MLC had jurisdiction to consider the same equitable issues raised before the High Court,
and grant appropriate relief,
in which case a stay of proceedings in the High Court was sought pending an MLC
determination.<P>
Held: s18(1)/1993 providing for the MLC to hear and determine claims at law or equity to the
ownership of Maori land
confers sufficient equitable jurisdiction for the MLC to consider the matters at issue, although
such jurisdiction is not mentioned in s227(1)/1953 or
s152(1)/1993 (virtually identical provisions dealing with applications for confirmation). Where
there are two proceedings
in different courts, one should be stayed (<I>Railex Services Ltd v Chemoil Machinery
Ltd</I> A1220/85, 20 December
1985, Auckland registry, referred to). It would be "sensible" for the MLC proceedings to
continue because of its expertise,
the limited means of the parties, and procedural efficiency (the matter would have to go back
to the MLC anyway if the
defendants succeeded before the High Court). <P>

<H3> Proprietors of Mawhera and another v The Maori Land Court and another </H3><BR>
<I>CP 173/92 High Court Christchurch, 19 December 1994. Tipping J<P>
</I>The Mawhera incorporation sought judicial review of comments by the Maori Land Court
that land sales and
purchases by the incorporation might be ultra vires the law governing the corporation's
activities. Arising from the same
judgment, a former chair of the incorporation applied for certiorari and the striking out of
comments derogatory of him.
Held: the privative section 64/1953 (orders and proceedings of the MLC not removable to the
High Court) does not prevent
High Court consideration of ultra vires proceedings of the MLC (<I>Anisminic Ltd</I>
[1969] 2 AC 147, <I>Bulk
Gas Users</I> [1983] NZLR 129 and other relevant cases on privative clauses considered). In
principle, and subject to the
discretion of the court, comments by a court about a person ought to be reviewable even if
comments (as opposed to orders
or determinations) do not fall easily within the normal requirements for judicial review,
certiorari or declaration. The
comments in this case were made in breach of procedural fairness and were therefore ultra
vires. 
The MLC was wrong to rule that sales of land by the incorporation were ultra vires, the
incorporation having power to do
so either under s48(1)/1967 which gives the power to sell land without the need for this power
to be specified as an object
of the incorporation (<I>Ngati Whakaue Tribal Lands v Rotorua District Council</I>
M436/80, 11 February 1982
distinguished), or by an order listing land selling as a specific object which had here been
validly made under ss27 and
28/1967. The MLC was however correct in its view that, in the case of purchase, any
purchases must beincidental to lawful
independent objects (eg farming) of the incorporation. Section 50/1967 providing for the
purchase of lands does not, in
similar terms to s48, provide that purchases may be made even though this activity is not
specified as an object. Sections
27 and 28 which provide for amendments to objects do not allow an amendment to make land
purchase an object. Orders
amending the incorporation objects under ss27 and 28 which purported to make land
purchasing an object were therefore
ultra vires.<P>
[ed: the determination that the purchasing powers of an incorporation may be limited will
probably have little practical
impact since the 1993 Act provides incorporations with very broad powers to enter into
transactions, and pre-existing
incorporations may broaden their objects on application to the court after a general meeting of
shareholders - ss253(a) and
358A. It was noted in this case that  a s452/1953 (now s44/1993) application to have the
Chief Judge of the MLC review
the MLC decision was not pursued because the solicitor for one of the parties was the Chief
Judge's wife. Because of work
in the Waitangi Tribunal, the Chief Judge has delegated the hearing of s44 applications and
many other MLC matters to the
Deputy Chief Judge under s8/1993 - see  <I>Memorandum 7 June 1994</I>. [1994] Chief
Judge's MB 231]<P>

<H3>  Ngai Tahu Maori Trust Board &amp; ors v D-G of Conservation &amp;
ors</H3><BR>
<I>CP 841/92 High Court Wellington, 23 December 1994. Neazor J<P>
</I>The applicants, including 2 companies, who held permits under the Marine Mammals
Protection Act 1978 to take
tourists by boat to observe whales at close quarters, challenged the proposed issue by the D-G
of a further permit for whale
watching, and the issuing of a permit allegedly in breach of an interim order of the court when
these proceedings were first
brought. The applicants, representing Ngai Tahu people who are tangata whenua of the
region, argued that the Treaty of
Waitangi was relevant to the D-G's decision in that he should have regard to the likely
economic impact on them, and that
they had a legitimate expectation that no further permits would be issued until they had had
sufficient time to repay capital
development costs of their commercial whale watching enterprises.<P>
Held: the Treaty is not legally enforceable except insofar as it is incorporated into municipal
law by statute (<I>Hoani Te
Heuheu Tukino</I> [1941] AC 308 followed), and a comment of the Privy Council in the
recent Maori broadcasting case
(<I>NZ Maori Council v A-G</I> [1994] 1 NZLR 513) that this was only "normally"
the case did not affect that
position. Although s4 of the Conservation Act 1987 requires that that Act be interpreted and
administered so as to give effect
to the principles of the Treaty, and the Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978 is, by inclusion
in a schedule to the
Conservation Act, administered under it, s4 was not thereby imported into the 1978 Act. The
D-G was required only to
<I>administer</I> the 1978 Act in accordance with the principles of the Treaty, which meant
consulting if a particular
Maori claim arose, but otherwise, in his substantive decision, he might only take into account
matters in the 1978 Act (which
made no mention of the Treaty or Maori issues). Nor did the evidence show that Ngai Tahu
had historically exercised a right
to the catching of large whales in this region (Kaikoura) which the Treaty would have
protected (Waitangi Tribunal
<I>Muriwhenua Fishing</I> and <I>Ngai Tahu Sea Fisheries</I> reports referred to). A claim
to a right based on
aboriginal title also failed, the historical evidence did not support it, and access to the resource
was now wholly governed
by the 1978 Act (without however necessarily extinguishing any aboriginal right). Noted that
there may be a question
whether a company under the Companies Act (2 of the applicants in this case) can claim rights
for Maori under the Treaty
or aboriginal title - but this was not contested by any party.<P>
The Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992, preventing future claims to
commercial fisheries, was not
relevant, because it concerned mammals andnot fish. The argument that there was a legitimate
expectation based on Treaty
principles also failed. With regard to the permit issued without consultation while the interim
order was in force, the
consultative process was flawed and Ngai Tahu interests should be consulted when the permit
came up for renewal in a few
months. Consultation should not just be on "major issues" as the D-G contended, but
should occur "when a reasonable
partner would consult."<P>
[ed: the judgment seems to require that in some situations the D-G must consult and note
Maori concerns even where he
is unable to take them into account in a final decision. This places the D-G and Maori in a
difficult position, and may
encourage cynicism about the consultation process. Perhaps some clarification by Parliament is
required]

District Council  </H3>
<I>M No 1128/94 High Court Auckland, 22 November 1994. Cartwright J<P>
</I>Review was sought by a private tourist company and Ngati Rauhoto of a district council
decision not to notify an
application for a resource consent for a tourism development on the banks of the Waikato
river. The council made the
decision under s94 Resource Management Act 1991 believing that any adverse effect on the
environment would be minor
and that it had adequate information of concerns of any affected groups, including Ngati
Rauhoto. Ngati Rauhoto alleged
that a sacred spring would be affected by the development (of which the council was aware,
although its location had not
been precisely ascertained at the time of hearing).
Held: following the general approach to judicial review, the court will intervene where
effectively no weight has been given
to a relevant factor or it has been ignored, but not where there are merely opposing views. The
tourist company action
failed, but Ngati Rauhoto had not had the opportunity to pinpoint the spring site or discuss
concerns about the impact of the
development on the mauri of the river. This failure to adequately consult was unreasonable
and written consent would be
required under s94, or failing this, public notification.<P>

<H3>Brown and others v Pourau and others </H3><BR>
<I>CP 53/88 High Court Hamilton, 23 November 1994. Hammond J<P>
</I>A kuia (elderly Maori woman) with a large immediate family had, by will, left the property
lived on by the family
absolutely to her eldest child. This child in turn left the property absolutely to her son who
wished to sell it outside the
family. The children of the kuia challenged probate of her will, arguing that she had lacked
testamentary capacity, or that
the absolute bequest to the eldest child was impressed with a secret trust "for the
family" The land was general land,
not Maori land.
Held: it was accepted that key institutions of Maori culture were associated with the property,
including birth of the children
on it and burial of the pito (afterbirth), the holding of tangihanga (funerals) there; and the
property was regarded as
turangawaewae (lit. a "place to stand"). Although the kuia was a noted
"spiritualist" who would sometimes be
in a trancelike state called "wairangi", neither this (which was episodic only) nor her
failing eyesight had affected her
testamentary capacity. Nor had a secret trust (a form of constructive trust) for the family been
established on the balance
of probabilities. The evidence, including a failed application to have the land declared a s439
papakainga reservation,
supported the existence of a moral obligation only with regard to the family. Cases regarding
testamentary capacity and
secret trusts were fully discussed. The existence of ohaki, a form of oral will, was noted. It
was also noted that under
s145/1953 the Maori Land Court had vested the land absolutely in the kuia even though her
husband had left it to her in
trust for the family. This aspect was not however challenged. Mot of the children had
consented to the vesting order.<P>

<H3>  Registrar-General of Land v Marshall</H3><BR>
<I>AP 30/94 High Court Hamilton, 19 December 1994. Hammond J<P>
</I>A District Land Registrar accepted a transfer of Maori land and registered it without it
having been produced to the
Maori Land Court for noting and endorsement as required by s83/1967. The respondent in this
case, who was noted as the owner in land transfer records,
was challenged by the Maori owners recorded in MLC records. The respondent also faced
problems obtaining finance from
the Maori Affairs Department to use the land as security because of the state of the title. He
applied to the MLC for a ruling
as to ownership. The MLC found in his favour. The respondent claimed against the DLR the
cost of proceedings before the
MLC and was awarded part costs in the District Court. That decision was appealed.<P>
Held: despite an assurance from the DLR that he had an indefeasible title (<I>Housing
Corporation of NZ v Maori
Trustee</I> [1988] 2 NZLR 662 confirms that failure to comply with noting requirements in
the MLC does not affect a
registered title), the respondent was entitled to compensation under s172 Land Transfer Act
1952 because he had suffered
loss through an omission of the DLR, even though that loss was not deprivation of any estate
or interest in land (the policy
principles behind the insurance provided by s172 were discussed). Even if a solicitor has been
negligent in seeking an
endorsement from the MLC before applying for registration, a responsibility remains on the
DLR, where he is aware that
the land is Maori land, to check that all laws have been complied with (reg 16 Land Transfer
Regulations 1966). No policy
reason existed to restrict liability of the DLR, since DLRs are aware that MLC records are
extensively used by Maori people
and the (former) Maori Affairs Department. The lower court had been correct however to
apportion liability for contributory
negligence by the solicitor who had sought registration of  the transfer, since the heaviest
responsibility lay there. The
comments of the MAC in Pakiri R Block (Case Stated 1/93, 23 March 1993 see MLR April
1994) that there may be a
"cavalier" attitude to MLC noting requirements were noted.<P>
[ed: if there is a "cavalier" approach to noting requirements, it will no doubt be
tempered in future by the knowledge
that there may be financial repercussions for DLRs in some cases. His Honour several times
reiterated the policy importance
of the indefeasibility principle remaining paramount. Yet the MAC in <I>Pakiri R</I> queried
whether registration
requirements of Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 may in certain cases affect that principle.]<P>

<H2><HR> General </H2>
<H3>  Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims</H3><BR>
<I>8 December 1994. Office of Treaty Settlements, Department of Justice<P>
</I>A "Settlement Envelope" totalling $1000 million will be set aside over
"about" a 10 year period to settle
all "historical" claims, ie, claims about Crown actions prior to 21 September 1992 (the date
on which Cabinet agreed certain
principles for settling claims, and two days before the Sealord Settlement was signed). The
amount in the envelope is not
negotiable, although the concept of the envelope is. Some expenditure already incurred in
settling claims will be deducted
from the envelope (including $170 million for the Sealord Settlement but not including
research funding from the Waitangi
Tribunal or Crown Forestry Rental Trust). Maori do not have to accept the envelope concept
to enter negotiations (although
they will be bound by it). As the envelope is used, the residual amount will be updated by the
Consumer Price Index.
Current programmes for Maori development generally ("article II" expenditure) are not
affected. The current land bank
system managed by DOSLI for surplus Crown lands is continued and falls within the envelope
policy.<P>

<B>Settling particular types of claims</B><P>
<I>Conservation estate:</I> this includes all lands administered by the Department of
Conservation. Because of the
public interest in them, they will be used only sparingly in settlements, and current levels of
management and access
retained. Properties which might be returned include waahi tapu, other sites of special
importance (certain lake and river
beds and mountains) and other "discrete parcels". Consultation with conservation groups
will proceed on a case by case
basis.
<I>Natural resource claims: </I>the Crown will admit only claims to use rights (not
ownership rights) and "cultural
and spiritual values" in "natural resources" (ie natural resources other than land). Further,
claims concerning the use of
resources "substantially unknown or unused"  at 1840 will not be admitted by the
Crown.<P>
<I>Gifted lands:</I> lands gifted by Maori to the Crown, or where the Crown arranged a gift
to a third party (often
for schools) will be specially considered, and Maori conceptions of gifting will be taken into
account. Claims to gifted lands
where current legal obligations (eg Public Works Act procedures) or common law obligations
apply will be dealt with outside
Waitangi Tribunal procedures. <P>
<B>The Negotiations Process</B><P>
<I>Revised negotiations procedure: </I>a "Negotiations Work Programme" would
modify the current process,
placing greater emphasis on the work needing to be done before a claim is accepted for
negotiation, so that, once accepted,
settlement quickly follows. Claims must be fully researched and proved before they will be
accepted onto the work
programme. Even if the Waitangi Tribunal believes a claim is well-founded, the Crown will
develop its own view.
<I>Claimant representation: </I>claimants will be required to present a "deed of
mandate" before negotiations
commence. A proposed law change would allow the Waitangi Tribunal to decline to hear
claims where a sufficient mandate
was lacking.<P>
<I>Ensuring finality: </I>the deed of mandate would be publicly notified to help define the
beneficiaries of a claim
settlement. Where there is substantial disagreement, either the Waitangi Tribunal or the Maori
Land Court would assist in
resolving the issue. Claimant groups would also be asked to formally endorse the legal body
receiving settlement assets. This
endorsement would set out how the legal body will be structured to ensure settlement benefits
are properly distributed. The
jurisdiction of the Waitangi Tribunal and the courts to consider claims would be gradually
wound back as settlements are
concluded. Views are also sought on changes to the current system of memorials on Crown
forest lands and assets
transferred to State-owned enterprises which hold those lands for future settlements. The
government would like these
memorials removed before final settlements are reached. A law change is also proposed to
provide that the Tribunal not hear
claims settled since September 1992.<P>
<B>Consultation over the proposals</B><P>
A series of regional hui will be held, followed by a national hui in April 1995. There is no
structured negotiation with
non-Maori groups, but submissions may be made until 19 May 1995. Beyond that, no process
is outlined.<P>
[ed: this envelope proposal was foreshadowed in the Sealord fisheries settlement. Exactly how
its size was determined is,
perhaps understandably, not stated (the documents make only general comments on this
point). No cut off date for lodging
claims has been set, but the Crown seeks submissions on this issue. June 1996 had been
proposed, but is now considered
unrealistic.<P>The Crown has presented only proposals and not firm policy (the size of the envelope is not
debatable - but the concept is!).
This might preven claims about the proposals being considered by the Waitangi Tribunal
(claims must be about
"policies" not proposals). <P>
The revised negotiations process, requiring claims to be better proven before negotiations
even start, may improve on the
present situation, where claimants can undertake years of negotiation before knowing if their
claim has been accepted as
valid. However, a greater load would be placed on the claimants to organise and research
claims before coming to the Crown
- they must also establish their "deed of mandate", in itself a difficult task. There is a
further hurdle in the suggestion
that, even where the Waitangi Tribunal has heard and reported on a claim, the Crown will
form its own opinion of how
well-founded the claim is. This sounds remarkably like the Crown judging its own case. What
purpose then, does a tribunal
report serve?<P>
Statements about claims concerning ownership of "natural resources" are controversial.
In ruling out some of these
claims, the Government is relying on a brief comment of the Court of Appeal in  <I>Te
Runanga o
Te Ikawhenua v A-G</I> (CA
124/93, 17 December 1993) to the effect that Maori cannot make claims concerning electricity
generation because they did
not contemplate this use of water in 1840. The Court of Appeal may not have intended its
comment to be read so broadly,
and may have different views for different resources.
Conservation groups may be disappointed that consultation with them remains ad hoc. The
many suggestions on this aspect

<H3>  Heads of Agreement between HM the Queen and RTK Mahuta and the Tainui Maori
Trust Board and
others</H3><BR>
<I>21 December 1994. Office of Treaty Settlements, Department of Justice.</I><P>
This document, signed by Tainui claimants and the Crown, records on a without prejudice
basis matters agreed in
principle to be contained in a later deed of settlement. No legal obligations between the parties
or affecting any third party
are created. Legislation will be required to give effect to the settlement. The agreement
records that, among other things,
the deed of settlement will contain:<P>
- A public apology from the Crown for confiscating Waikato-Tainui land, and an estimate of
the claimants that the raupatu
(confiscated) lands have a minimum modern value of $12 billion. <P>
- Confirmation of the return of the Te Rapa Air Force Base (value $4.123 million)<P>
- Provision for the transfer, within 5 years, of 35,787 acres Crown controlled properties (of
which 33,984 acres will be
transferred without improvements). If the Crown elects, commercial leases in favour of the
Crown will be negotiated over
lands before they are transferred. The lands will have a market valuation. The Crown and
claimants reserve rights, after
consultation, to change lands offered or accepted in the package. On transfer, the lands will be
held in the name of Potatau
Te Wherowhero (the first Maori King) for the benefit of Waikato-Tainui people.<P>
- Transfer of the rentals accumulated from forestry licences granted over the Maramarua and
Onewhero forests under the
Crown Forest Assets Act 1989. This will be achieved by a joint application to the Waitangi
Tribunal, which will have to rule on a competing claim to the Maramarua forest by the
Hauraki Maori Trust Board (Wai 373). The land
in these forests is included in the 35,787 acres to be transferred to the claimants<P>
- Reimbursement of $750,000 costs for research and negotiation of the claim<P>
- The establishment of a land acquisition trust fund of $170 million, minus the value of lands
transferred, and the $750,000
reimbursement of costs. Trustees will be appointed by the claimants after consultation with the
Crown, capital and income
are to be applied to acquisition of further land and improvements, including land for endowed
colleges and provision of
educational facilities, grants or scholarships<P>
- An acknowledgement that the Treaty of Waitangi and its articles are not affected by the
settlement and that an ongoing
relationship in Treaty terms will continue to exist. Claims to the Waikato river and West Coast
harbours will also remain
unaffected.<P>
The agreement notes that legislation will be required to implement the settlement to provide
for the end of the scheme of
resumptive clauses on the titles of state enterprise and former state enterprise lands in the
claim area, the end of the
scheme for returning forest lands under the Crown Forest  Assets Act 1989 in the claim area,
the end of annual payments
to the Tainui Trust Board, and provision for the Head of Kahui Ariki recognised by the Tainui
tribes (or nominee) to be
a permanent member of any conservation board in the claim area, as well as "other provisions
to achieve certainty, finality
and durability" of the settlement.<P>
Tainui in exchange will give up within the claim area (excluding the Waikato River and East
Coast harbours), all claims
concerning confiscation, claims to lands under the state enterprises and Crown forest
resumptive schemes, claims to any
minerals and forests and claims to 47,000 acres of land administered by the Department of
Conservation (this last
relinquishment is said to be a "free gift" from Tainui to the nation).<P>
The agreement may be reviewed by the parties and terminated if they have not entered into a
deed of settlement within 6
months. The claimants undertake to provide a deed of mandate authorising them to sign the
deed of settlement. Finally, the
agreement notes that the Waikato-Tainui confiscation was the largest by area, and that the
redress outlined represents 17%
of the total redress available to settle all historical claims (including the existing fisheries
settlement) and "approximately
20% of the redress for all claims" excluding the fisheries claims.<P>
[ed: in whatever terms it is measured, this is surely the largest offer ever made to settle a claim
with a single iwi. There
is much to be done before it is finalised. Many properties to be returned are subject to the
"offer back" provisions of
public works legislation, which have to run their course before the land is free for return. The
claimants face hard a task
of first achieving a deed of mandate, then ensuring that groups outside and within Tainui will
live with the settlement. The
Crown proposal, contained in its broad settlement package, to give the Waitangi Tribunal
jurisdiction to "screen out"
unrepresentative groups who make claims, may soon be required by these Tainui claimants. It
is well known that "full and
final" settlements in the past have failed to live up to their promise. This proposed
settlement follows that same path
and contains no provision for ongoing review. Perhaps the Crown is hoping this time that the
scale of the redress and the
ongoing activities of the land acquisition fund (which may have up to $65 million to work
with) will prevent an erosion of
the value of the settlement in years to come]<P>

<H3>Launch of the Decade of the World's Indigenous People  </H3><BR>
<I>hrdesk@igc.apc.org<P>
</I>The decade (1995-2004) was launched on 8 December 1994, at a special ceremony in the
UN General Assembly.
Indigenous representatives of six different regions of the world (Arctic, NorthAmerica, Latin
America, Asia, Pacific and
Africa) addressed the meeting. Under the theme "Indigenous people: a new relationship -
partnership in  action", the
decade is intended to be a time for the UN, governments and other organisations "to give
priority to the new role of
indigenous people as decision makers and beneficiaries of national, regional and international
development activities" and
to "commit themselves fully to promoting and protecting the human rights of indigenous
people, reflecting those concerns
in relevant programmes and activities." The full participation of indigenous people in the
planning, implementation and
evaluation of development activities affecting their lives should be the basis of this partnership.
This decade arises from a
UN resolution adopted in 1993 (48/163, 21 December), the International Year for the
World's Indigenous People. One
initiative is a proposal that 9 August each year be declared the International Day of Indigenous
People. NZ lawyer Donna
Hall, speaking for the NZ Maori Congress at the 8 December launch, commented on Maori
disappointment over resourcing
of the electoral option process, policy making about the settlement of claims without early
Maori input, and inadequate
facilities for Maori to independently prepare and debate policy. She urged the establishment of
international standards so
that the commitment of the state and indigenous peoples to each other can be fully and visibly
debated.<P>

the appointment of Local
Employment Commissioners to chair local action groups liaising with Maori and other groups
to devise local solutions to
unemployment. A National Employment Commissioner and National Action Group would
focus on national policies. These
would include removal of impediments to development of resources in the Maori Trust Boards
Act 1955 and reserved lands
legislation, providing targeted business advice to Maori (particularly Maori women), and the
possible appointment of Maori
Employment Commissioners. It is also proposed that the parents as first educators scheme be
piloted in a Maori context
immediately, and that more resources be provided for language at kohanga reo and kaupapa
Maori levels, particularly
through the provision of more teachers. The number of Maori career advisors in schools
should be increased. Research
should be undertaken on the reasons for the career choices of Maori youth (to be completed

the work of Te Puni Kokiri
(Ministry of Maori Development) and recommend policy initiatives. The continuation of the
present claims resolution
processes is advocated, including more support for the Waitangi Tribunal and a rejection of
the "fiscal envelope" approach,
which it is said will pit Maori against Maori. Other suggestions include  the establishment of a
Maori Cultural Foundation
to handle all funding of Maori arts, piloting of a scheme allowing income support payments to
be made by Maori trusts
to beneficiaries, an increase in resources to early childhood education, the establishment of a
Maori Education Authority to
promote Maori education, encouragement of Maori sport, encouraging the use by Maori of
resources to develop small
businesses, providing funding for community based employment enterprises (COMBEES), and
a review by the Law

Maori<P>
[ed: some of the ideas need further work. An independent Maori Development Commission
seems like a sound idea, but,
as proposed, it would double up on the monitoring role of Te Puni Kokiri, and having it

it monitors that organisation may not make for the most rigorous examination. Labour will be
seeking comment on these
proposals through hui and informal discussion on marae in the coming months, but no definite
timetable is set]<P>

<H2><HR>Not Just One Tree Hill</H2>
It is becoming abundantly clear that the proposals released in December 1994 have stirred a
suppressed
impatience among Maori about progress with claim settlements and that the fiscal cap aspect
of the
proposals will be generally rejected. The Government was given ample warning that this
would be the
case. In the Parliamentary debate following the announcement of the proposals, all
non-Government
speakers complimented the Government on its attempt to grapple with these issues, but
warned that setting
a fiscal limit would bring trouble. Helen Clarke said:  Sometimes the Government may be in a
position
in which it can attribute Maori opposition to, perhaps, a small group of activists or radicals.
This is not
one of those times. The reservation about this concept stretches across Maoridom. .... The
whole concept
of settling is in danger of becoming totally discredited because of the attempt to confine it to a
set sum of
money and to imply that timetables are involved. If we discredit the concept of settling in a fair
and just
way, then I fear that it will not be just one tree on One Tree Hill that suffers, but rather the
state of affairs
in our country generally.  (NZPD 8 December 1994)<P>
There are other concerns arising from the present debate. One is the nature of advice from the
Treasury.
If, as has been reported, Treasury advised that the settlement fund idea would  reduce many
claimants
inflated expectations , one wonders how thoughtfully and thoroughly these issues were
investigated. This
phrase is more reminiscent of letters to the editor than carefully considered policy advice on a
matter of
constitutional importance. In policy documents produced in 1987, Treasury admitted  It would
be
surprising if any settlement that might realistically be expected would extinguish all sense of
grievance.
What may be hoped for is that the level of settlements be a sufficient indicator of the sincerity
and good
intentions of the Government to satisfy most Maori and non-Maori opinion that justice had
been done in
a reasonable way  (Government Management. Brief to the Incoming Government vol 1 p331).
Is that
central concern for justice evident in its advice today?<P>
Another concern is the pressure the consultation process is placing on Maori bureaucrats. As
Wira
Gardiner, Chief Executive of Te Puni Kokiri, has put it, these officials are often prominent
members of
their tribes, and are having to carry a message which their tribes by and large are rejecting
(Wanganui
Chronicle 20 February 1995). The cost of doggedly continuing to promote the fiscal cap might
be the loss
of talented Maori policy advisors for the future.<P>

<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3> Fisheries Allocation Claim: Determination of Preliminary Issues </H3>
<I>Wai 447, 27 January 1995. CJ Durie, GS Orr, JR Morris</I><P>
This claim alleges that the Crown and the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission have
breached the
Treaty principles, both in appointments made by the Crown to the Commission and through
the process
to create proposals for the allocation of assets. The tribunal, as a preliminary matter, asked for
argument
whether (a) actions of the Commission could be actions by or on behalf of the Crown; (b) the
Treaty of
Waitangi (Fisheries Claim) Settlement Act 1992 (which amended tribunal jurisdiction)
prevented
consideration of this claim; (c) the tribunal should defer its inquiry in light of potential
remedies available
before the courts.<P>
Held: s6(7) Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 provides that the tribunal may not inquire into
commercial fishing
rights or terms of the settlement, but this privative clause does not restricthearing of claims
concerning the
allocation of benefits of the settlement, as opposed to the settlement itself. However, if the
High Court
were to determine it is precluded from considering further fisheries matters because of a
private clause
directed at it in s9/1992, which is worded in substantially the same way as the privative clause
applying
to the tribunal, the tribunal may be  bound  to revise its opinion.<P>
As to whether the Commission acts on behalf of the Crown, the tribunal sees the claim as
against the
Crown and whether it has properly delegated its Treaty responsibilities to the Commission and
ought to
intervene in the current situation of apparent disagreement on allocation methods (noted that if
it dealt with
the substantive claim, the tribunal may need to do no more than consider whether an impasse
has been
reached and the Crown ought to intervene, ie it may not need to make any determination
regarding  mana
moana ). The tribunal should however sensibly defer its inquiry because the High Court might
provide a
stronger remedy, and technical matters of administrative law were involved (noted that the
tribunal
continues to hold the position that it will not intervene where it might prejudice court
proceedings. This
upholds the constitution, and also the Treaty, in which the Queen promised  necessary laws
and
institutions . Within this rule however, circumstances vary, and in the past the tribunal has
proceeded with
contemporaneous inquiries, and withheld reporting until court proceedings were completed, or
reported
on certain aspects of a claim only).<P>
The tribunal also noted, in passing, that a scheme for pre-settlement assets allocation will
require
 substantial agreement, if not consensus  from a general meeting of Maori to be passed under
the terms
of the 1992 Act.<P>
[ed: this last comment could be viewed as a strong hint that the mana whenua/mana moana
allocation
proposal, which appears to have split the commission down the middle, may not presently
carry enough
support legally to see it through. An issue of perceived bias was raised on the basis that
several of the
tribunal members sitting had been involved in the Fisheries Settlement Report 1992 which
expressed
opinions on the Sealord settlement. This issue was put to one side, it being noted that the
composition of
the tribunal sitting to hear preliminary issues might differ from that which might later sit to
hear the
substantive claim. On a matter of procedure, the tribunal had suggested that it simply state a
case to the
High Court, which would place all fisheries proceedings before one body. Claimant counsel
argued against
this approach since no appeal would lie from any High Court determination of a case stated.
Having the
tribunal first state its view, with a potential for review of that decision, would provide, in
essence, an
appeal process]<P>

<H3>  Ngati Awa, Tuwharetoa and associated claims. Memorandum following fourth
hearing</H3>
<I>Wai 46, 17 February 1995. CJ Durie</I><P>
This memorandum deals, within the context of the broader Ngati Awa claim, with two areas
of land taken
for works associated with the Matahina dam, under public works legislation in the 1960s. In
both cases,
the tribunal listed a number of possible breaches of Treaty principles which seemed to have
occurred, and
noted that it had  serious doubts  that these required further investigation, and invited the
Crown to
expedite the settlement of these claims. It was noted that it is not readily apparent from the Te
Maunga
Railway Lands report (Wai 315, August 1994 - which allowed that land could be compulsorily
taken in
special cases, despite the Treaty) what is  the basis for bending the Treaty s terms to suit
modern
convenience or principles of necessity . In any event, the Treaty would seem to be
authoritative for the
view that no Crown use or exploitation of Maori land could be contemplated without, at least,
reasonable
consultation with the owners and a free and informed consideration by them of appropriate
terms.<P>
[ed: this memorandum appears to be saying that the Treaty either forbids absolutely any
compulsory
takings (and the Te Maunga report ought not to have conceded this point (see MLR
September 1994)), or
that, at least, full consultation and informed consent are required in each case. The tribunal
noted that the
government is developing a policy on public works takings, and should make itself aware of
these cases
before that policy is considered. In another development in this claim, the Crown has filed a
memorandum
expressing concern about the tribunal determination of 11 November 1994 that a prima facie
case had been
made out in relation to the Rotoehu forest - a forest potentially affected by offer back
provisions under the
Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 (as amended by the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989)]<P>

<H3>  Tribunal appointment</H3>
<I>16 February 1995. Office of the Hon John Luxton.</I><P>
Te Ahikaiata John Joseph Turei has been appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal. He is a 76 year
old kaumatua
of Tuhoe descent with 17 grandchildren. As a child, he grew up speaking only Maori, and
travelled with
Maori MPs including Sir Apirana Ngata. He was a member of the Maori Battalion from 1937
to 1946.
He performed the wero at the inaugural Waitangi commemorations in 1934. He has since
escorted many
dignitaries onto marae throughout the country and been a representative for cultural events,
such as  Te
Maori , overseas. He has been active in many community programmes, being awarded the
Queen's
Service and Commemorative Medals in 1986 and 1990 respectively for those services, and the
Sir Kingi
Ihaka Award in 1993 for services to Maori in preserving Te Reo and Maori culture. He spoke
at Waitangi
in 1995, saying that he has been outraged and affronted by recent protests, and commending
the
Government on its efforts in producing Treaty claim settlement proposals, but also expressing
the view
that  the complexities of Treaty issues have no simple solutions, certainly not contained within
a fiscal
envelope.  Mr Turei's appointment gives the Tribunal its full complement of 16 members.<P>

<H3> Claim by M Norman and W Te Kani re kiwifruit marketing  </H3>
<I>Wai 449, 19 December 1994</I><P>
The claim states that at 6 February 1840, Maori were trading internationally. The Kiwifruit
Marketing
Regulations 1977 established under the Primary Products Marketing Act 1953 now regulate
the sale of
kiwifruit overseas. In 1988 and 1994, reviews of these regulations  recommended changes to
enable
greater grower choice. The Crown through its delegate, the Kiwifruit Marketing Board, has
pursued a
policy of export to Japan without considering various matters, including trading rights of
Maori guaranteed
under the Treaty. The claimants seek recommendations that Maori growers be compensated
for loss of
earnings, the Kiwifruit Marketing Board grant to Maori kiwifruit producers an export licence,
and in the
interim Maori kiwifruit growers be granted rights to market direct to Japanese importers.<P>
[ed: although it is attracting some business attention, because of implications for the industry
and other
similarly regulated industries (apple and pear and dairy), the tribunal has no plans to hear this
claim in the
near future. Maori growers make up 10% of the kiwifruit industry (The Independent, 10 & 17
February
1995)<P>

<H2><HR> Other Jurisdictions </H2>
<H3>  In Re Green (deceased) and Green v Robson</H3>
<I>M366/90 HC Hamilton, 16 December 1994 Hammond J</I><P>
The plaintiff claimed under the Family Protection Act 1955 that he was entitled to all of a
block known
as Awaroa, which the deceased had left in part to the plaintiff, but also to foster children and
grandchildren. The family of the deceased had raised many foster children. The plaintiff alleged
that he
had a claim because of need, but also because of a desire to keep the block, which had come
to the
deceased through her spouse, in the male side of the family. At an earlier period, the plaintiff
had also
worked on the block for several years. The estate overall was a small one, (around $34,000)
composed
almost entirely of interests in Maori land. <P>
Held: The 1955 Act requires an assessment whether there has been a breach of moral duty,
judged by the
standards of a wise and just testator (Little v Angus [1981] 1 NZLR 126 (CA) cited).
Competing claims
of Maori custom cannot override a claim which has been made out in terms of the Act (Re
Stubbing [1990]
1 NZLR 428), but whether such competing claims would be termed moral claims which would
reduce the
amount the successful claimant gets is unclear. The courts would probably recognise a moral
duty of a
testator towards children adopted customarily even though they could not themselves bring a
claim under
the Act. When dealing with Maori families regard is to be had to the strong attachment of
Maori to the
land and deeply held family feelings in that respect (Re Ham (1990) 6 FRNZ 158). Parliament
has  begun
to adjust further  the position of Maori in relation to the 1955 Act by providing in Te Ture
Whenua Maori
Act 1993 (s 106(4)), that Maori customary marriages before 1 April 1952 will be recognised
for the
purposes of the 1955 Act.<P>
As a general principle, freedom of testamentary disposition is important in New Zealand, to
which the
1955 Act is an exception. Without evidence on the matter, the best solution for Maori land is
to respect
the judgments of those making decisions about the land, unless there is a very good reason to
interfere.
There being no particular evidence presented of Maori custom in this case,  it should be dealt
with on
conventional and well established principles. The plaintiff should have all of the block. He had
established
a breach of moral duty, being the only natural child of the deceased, living in modest
circumstances, had
helped to maintain the land, and there were no competing claims of economic need. Moral
claims of the
foster children, if any, were outweighed by these circumstances.<P>
[ed: the judgment might have noted that Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 provides a further
and quite
broad exception to the principle that testators should be free to dispose of their interests as
they see fit.
Wills made after 1 July 1993 purporting to dispose of interests in Maori land beyond specified
groups are
voided by the Act (s108(5)). Provision for customary marriages under the 1955 Act has
existed since 1967
(Maori Affairs Amendment Act 1967 s80(3)].<P>

<H3> Ngati Rangatahi Whanaunga (Association) v NZ Police </H3>
<I>W5/95 PT, 3 February 1995. Treadwell J</I><P>
The applicants had obtained an interim enforcement order under s320 Resource Management
Act 1991,
preventing work on a new police station at Taumarunui. The site concerned had long been
under dispute
by local Maori, being taken under the Public Works Act 1908 in 1911 (compensation was paid
to the
District Maori Land Board). A claim was made to the Waitangi Tribunal about the land in
1990. The
Police applied to cancel the order. <P>
Held: the order should be cancelled. There was a need for a new police station (the old one
had been
demolished in anticipation of the new building), substantial damages would result to
contractors if work
was delayed at this late stage. The Crown had put itself under an obligationto stop work
immediately
should human remains be found on the site. An undertaking as to damages should the order be
issued
would be critical, yet no undertaking had been offered. His Honour rejected submissions that
public
interest issues represented by Treaty of Waitangi obligations required issuance of an interim
order without
an undertaking as to damages, and that the Crown as a Treaty partner ought not to require
such an
undertaking. The Crown did require such an undertaking and believed that it had carried out
any Treaty
obligations (there had been ongoing discussion with the applicants about the proposed
construction). Waahi
tapu issues had been raised  at the very last moment.  Accordingly the interim order would be
cancelled
and an urgent hearing date of the substantive matter set.<P>
[ed: Ngati Hauaroa hapu have since made a very public occupation of the site. They also
appealed this
decision to the High Court and lost. That judgment will be reviewed in next month s issue.
Given that the
land was taken under early public works legislation, and that the District Maori Land Board in
1911
consisted of 3 persons, of whom only one was required to be Maori, and had a Pakeha chair,
then
comments of the Waitangi Tribunal regarding adequate consultation and negotiation prior to
public works
takings in the Te Maunga Railway Lands report, and in a memo re Ngati Awa claims
(reviewed above)
might well be applicable to this case. As further background, Taumarunui was declared a 
native township 
under the Native Townships Act 1895. This heavy handed legislation provided that up to 500
acres of
Maori land could be brought under Crown control, for lease to Europeans for periods up to 42
years, with
rents being distributed to Maori, minus survey and other costs for bringing the township into
being.]<P>

<H3> Maori Reserved Lands Government Policy Decisions 1994 </H3>
<I>Minister of Maori Affairs & Minister of Lands. Te Puni Kokiri January 1995.
19pp</I><P>
The government is urging owners and lessees to reach their own arrangements for ending the
perpetual
terms of leases, revising rentals, etc under the Maori Reserved Land Act 1955. They will do
this against
a  bottom line  position provided by an amendment to that Act which the government hopes to
pass in
1995. This will provide:<P>
<I>Term of the leases:</I> All perpetually renewable leases will terminate at the end of the
current
term plus two further periods for 21 years. This will see the last leases terminating in 63 years,
and the
earliest in 42 years. Where any house on the land is a principal place of residence, lessees and
their
spouses will retain lifetime occupancy rights expiring 3 months after death. Lessees at the time
the
amending legislation is passed will be the  final  lessees, ie they will not be able to transfer their
interest
by will, gift or sale of the lease.<P>
<I>Improvements:</I> On termination of a lease, the owners will pay the market value of
improvements, or come to some different arrangement by mutual agreement. The consultative
working
group (see below) will advise on the procedure to be followed if the owners cannot afford the
improvements.<P>
<I>Rent:</I> 3 years after the amending legislation is passed, rent reviews will begin on the
first batch
of leases, with the aim of establishing market rents for all leases over the next 4 years. After
this first
review, rents reviews will be every 7 years. The Valuer General will, at government expense,
establish
for each property a benchmark ratio between the owner s and lessee s interest in the land
around which
the new market rents can be negotiated. Workshops held by the government will explain this
benchmark
approach to owners and lessees. The government expects that Maori owners will use the new
market rents
to establish a fund to assist in purchasing the interests of lessees. 
<I>Rights of first refusal:</I> the Maori owners will be given the right of first refusal to
purchase a
lessee s interest where the lessee wishes to sell (except where sale is to a family member).
Lessees will
have the right of first refusal where the Maori owners wish to sell general land. But if the land
is Maori
freehold land, the provisions of Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 as to sale apply unaffected
(these require
a right of first refusal be offered to specified groups related to the Maori owners).
<I>Compensation to lessees:</I> Lessees will be compensated for the loss of their perpetual
right to
renew at between 1.85-2.9% of the unimproved value of the land. This compensation will not
come out
of the fiscal envelope for Treaty settlements.
<I>Compensation to Maori:</I> Maori owners must pursue claims before the Waitangi
Tribunal for
compensation.
<I>Implementing the policy:</I> A consultative working group will be established by the
Minister of
Maori Affairs in early 1995 to advise on issues surrounding the proposed legislation.
[ed: most of the recommendations of the 1993 report of the Reserved Lands Panel have been
followed.
However, that Panel recommended against compensation to lessees, as they had enjoyed the
benefit of
cheap leases for many years. It also recommended financial assistance to Maori to purchase
improvements
where normal commercial facilities were not available. Maori claimants, whose petitioning
about the
injustice of perpetual leases over 100 years has finally led to this review, are given no certainty
of
compensation, only a right to continue their claims before the Waitangi Tribunal, where the
Crown is
resisting any argument that the system of perpetual leasing was unfair as conceived in the late
nineteenth
century (This was most recently argued in Wai 145, doc D2, 8 December 1994).
Compensation to Maori
for a system which the 1993 Panel described as  significantly unjust and evil  may best come
through land
swaps involving surplus Crown lands which are under discussion in some areas. As a historical
comparison
with these proposals, the Maori Vested Lands Administration Act 1954 is worth a look, see

The focus of Maori claims settlement has now shifted to policy. The Sealord and proposed
Tainui
settlements are encouraging. The main issues before Maori now are representation and equity
between
tribes. These are particularly Maori policy matters to be resolved by Maori, not government. A
democratic
structure in which to do this is lacking, consequently, those who shout loudest in the media are
heard. The
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is one illustrative model which could be
looked to. The
word  settlement  in Australia refers more to settling a process for the future, than making
payment for
the past. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, which promotes informed public debate,
is particulary
important in the Australian scheme. Aboriginal land councils provide evidence that self
determination
within a national framework is both feasible and non-threatening. The proposal for a perpetual
land fund
in Australia also looks to the future.<P> 
In New Zealand the disparity between Maori objectives and public understanding (Maori are
not locked
into the past nor out to bankrupt the country), calls for more informed debate. A council of
leading Maori
and Pakeha New Zealanders might achieve this. The issue is primarily about the management
of race
relations in the coming years. Equity between tribes, and between  traditional and urban 
groups are
demanding issues at the moment, as well as equity between Maori and Pakeha. <P>

<I>Public Health Commission. Rangapu Hauora Tumatanui. February 1995.</I><P>
This document recommends a strategic plan for Maori public health. It states that increased
health risks
for Maori adults are a result of  relative social and economic disadvantages ... coupled with
unhealthy
lifestyle patterns . Car crashes are the leading cause of death among Maori males aged 15-44
and also
among females aged 15-24. Looking to the future, the report predicts there will be more
kaumatua than
ever before after 2000, and that, provided there is a transmission of cultural knowledge, this
will
considerably strengthen the pool of traditional leaders. Recommendations for the outcomes to
be achieved
by public health initiatives are specific. For eg; to reduce Maori deaths caused by motor
vehicle crashes
from 84 in 1990 to 64 or fewer by 1995, and to 44 or fewer by the year 2000 and reduce
hospital
admissions from crashes from 1,612 in 1991 to 1,312 or fewer by 1995, and to 1,012 or fewer
by the year
2000. Also to reduce the number of all Maori who smoke from 54% (1992) to 40% or less by
the year
2000.<P>
[ed: the outcomes are concisely stated, but the document assumes that the commission will
take the lead
in purchasing the public health services required and monitoring the outcomes achieved. The
recent
announcement that the commission will be disbanded therefore makes the future of this report
uncertain.
The commission s advisory role will be absorbed within the Health Ministry, and Regional
Health
Authorities will purchase public health services such as training programmes for health
workers,
immunisation programmes, health advertisements etc to produce the outcomes the report
recommends.
The question is whether there will be a loss of focus and commitment on Maori public health
issues which
the small, independent commission seems to have provided]<P>

<I>NZLJ December 1994 pp462-468. Professor FM Brookfield</I><P>
In this valedictory lecture Professor Brookfield argues that it is impossible to believe that the
chiefs who
signed the Treaty consented to the absolute and unlimited power of parliamentary sovereignty,
since this
would have included a power to destroy the tribal autonomy guaranteed under Article 2.
Consequently,
 when we look today to better performance by the government of its obligations to Maori, we
depend to
a large extent on action by a parliament which is itself the product of a partly revolutionary
seizure of
power.  The idea of a counter-revolution to restore Maori autonomy is rejected, but it is
argued that the
courts should now adopt a general principle that, except where Parliament expressly legislates
to the
contrary, all statutes should be interpreted against the background of the Treaty. This principle
could be
reached by emphasising the changed constitutional position and views of the Treaty since the
Privy Council
judgment in <I>Te Heuheu Tukino s case</I> in 1941.
[ed: just such an argument was raised, and rejected, by the High Court in <I>Ngai Tahu Maori
Trust
Board and others v Director-General of Conservation and others</I> CP 841/92, 23
December 1994
(reviewed in MLR Dec94-Jan95 issue). The argument might however be raised directly before
the Privy
Council if the Maori plaintiffs in the electoral option case appeal the Court of Appeal decision
in that
matter]<P>

<H2><HR>Ngai Tahu, forests and Waitangi Tribunal resourcing</H2>
The Waitangi Tribunal this month issued a memorandum with significant implications for the
Crown s
current claim settlement proposals (Memorandum re Ngai Tahu claim, Wai 27, 17 March
1995).<P>
In late December last year, the Ngai Tahu claimants filed papers stating that negotiations with
the Crown
over the settlement of their claim had broken down. They asked the tribunal, which had
already made
findings and recommendations on their land claim in 1991, to hold a further hearing on the
issue of relief.
Ngai Tahu asked in particular that the tribunal use its compulsory powers and make binding
recommendations that all Crown forest licensed land within the Ngai Tahu rohe be returned to
them
(pursuant to s8HB Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975). Such a recommendation would affect many
thousands
of hectares in the South Island.<P>
In a 13 page memorandum, the tribunal chairperson turned down the request for a full hearing
on relief,
on the grounds that the tribunal lacked the budget to undertake a hearing which might raise
complex issues,
and that substantial resources from the tribunal s meagre budget had already been expended on
the Ngai
Tahu claim since hearings began in 1987. The situation had been reached where further
hearing time for
this one iwi could detrimentally affect the chances for hearing and settlement for others.<P>
The memorandum dealt at length with historic underfunding of the tribunal ( the lack of
money has
considerably affected progress ) and the rivalry among iwi for hearing time and research
resources that
this had engendered. The chairperson noted that currently claim hearings are being postponed
or
cancelled because of the financial situation. <P>
The basic message, if the Government needed to hear it again at the moment, is that budgetary
stringency
in this area needs to be rethought, or else tensions will arise which may make claims even
more difficult
to settle. <P>

<H2><HR>  Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>Paehinahina Mourea Trust  </H3>
<I>237 Rotorua MB 114 7 February 1995 Savage J</I><P>
Application under s244/1993 for an order increasing trustee meeting fees. The proposed
increase was
endorsed at an annual meeting with beneficiaries.<P>
Held: the application should be rejected as the financial condition of trust was parlous. The
trustees
had shown a propensity to become involved in commercial  adventures  not related to the use
and
administration of the land (lending money to a hotel in financial difficulty, attempted
investment in a
casino, contemplated purchase of time shares in a hotel, purchase of life insurance for trustees,
contemplated investment in a white water rafting venture). <P>
Unique to Maori land law is that legal owners rights are vested in trustees when the owners
are not under
a disability and may not have consented to or even oppose the creation of the trust.
Accordingly special
sensitivity is called for on the part of trustees, who are often beneficial owners also. There is a
special duty
to take expert advice where large or unusual financial projects are contemplated.<P> 
Trustees must not profit from their trust and generally are not entitled to renumeration.
Exceptions are
provided by s237/1993 or s72 Trustee Act 1956 which allow for payment of a commission in
certain
situations. Ahu Whenua trusts are often businesses of some complexity and it is proper that
trustees be
paid. <P>
Looking to s72(1)(A)/1956, the level of payment in this case should be set looking to nine
factors: the basic
principle that trustees are not entitled as of right to renumeration, but should not lose it by
their labours;
the effort, knowledge and ability of the trustees; the nature of the obligation and the business;
the past
success of trustees; trustees loss occasioned by holding that office; parity between individual
trusts in the
area; ability of the trust to pay; efficiency of administration of the trust (eg no. of meetings
held); views
of the owners (here a meeting ratified an increase, but less than 5% of the owners by number
(2500) were
present).<P>
[For all the criticism of the trust, the increase sought was from a mere $105 to $150 per
meeting. Apart
from its less successful "adventures" the trust was involved in mining and forestry ventures
and
commercial leases. The highest meeting fee for any trust known to the court was $250 for a
successful
farming operation]<P>

<H3>  In Re Proprietors of Mangakino Township Inc</H3>
<I>Rotorua MB, 3 March 1995, Savage J</I><P>
Section 254/1993 provides that Maori incorporations under the Act may not grant leases "for
a term of
more than 21 years" without a special resolution of shareholders. The MLC registrar at
Rotorua was
advised that the Mangakino incorporation was intending to enter a lease for a total period,
including rights
of renewal, exceeding 21 years. No special resolution had been passed. The court advised the
incorporation it would, of its own motion under s280(3)(c)/1993, proceed to consider whether
an
investigation by a person appointed by the court should be made. A pre-hearing conference
determined
that while the intended lease would not proceed, the incorporation had granted other leases
whose total
term, inclusive of renewals, exceeded 21 years, in the belief that s254 referred only to the
initial term of
a lease.<P>
Held: an investigation should be held. Applying statutory interpretation principles, most
recently reviewed
in <I>Commissioner Inland Revenue, the Alcan NZ Ltd</I> (CA 150/93, 31 May 1994), s254
on its
face was capable of more than one interpretation, however the mischief Parliament sought to
remedy was
long term leasing without the owners consent. The incorporation s interpretation of the section
would make
it possible for leases without the owners consent to be made including renewal rights
potentially alienating
the land for hundreds of years. It had to be remembered that beneficial ownership remains
vested in
shareholders of an incorporation (s250/1993), and that s2(1)/1993 provides that the Act is to
be interpreted
to further the principles set out in the Preamble, which includes the principle of promoting the
retention
of Maori land in the hands of owners. Accordingly, "21 years" in s254 refers not only to the
initial term
but to any further terms in the form of  rights of renewal.<P>
A retrospective special resolution would not remedy the existing unlawful leases, nor an
amendment to the
objects of the incorporation. Section 2(2) provides that the court must further the objects of
the Act when
deciding whether to exercise any power under it. The objects of the Act include facilitating the
retention,
use, development and control of Maori land by the owners. Accordingly an investigation
should be
undertaken, with the Registrar as the investigating officer.<P>

<H2><HR> Waitangi Tribunal </H2>
<H3>Kiwifruit direction</H3>
<I>Wai 480, 15 March 1995. Deputy CJ Smith</I><P>
After a conference of parties, the tribunal gave directions for an urgent hearing of this claim,
noting that
 urgency  in the context of tribunal hearings should not be given its true dictionary definition
but refers
more to  prioritising  claims for hearing. A final report was required in time to remove
uncertainty
regarding marketing of the 1996 crop. The tribunal found difficulty fixing a hearing date.
Budgetary
constraints, including imposition by the government of a 3% saving requirement, had already
resulted in
a number of hearings in the current fiscal year (ending June 1995), being abandoned. In
addition, the
Federation of Maori Authorities and Wakatu Incorporation had notified that they were
affected by the
claim and required time to determine their stance in relation to it. A hearing date should be
fixed at the
earliest opportunity after 30 June 1995.<P>
[ed: these directions, and other directions noted this month (see below and front page),
suggest a trend
for the tribunal to have its ordinary hearing schedule determined by consideration of urgency
requests.
Given this trend and limited tribunal resources,  urgent hearing  may have an entirely new
meaning
by the end of 1995]<P>

<H3>Interesting claims recently filed</H3><P>
<I>Wai 462:</I> Joe Oneroa and others made a claim concerning the Crown acquisition of
Maungataniwha and Raetea forests in North Auckland and also the aerial drop of 1080 poison
for possum
control. No request for urgency was received. The tribunal asked the claimants to advise if
they wished
to proceed, given that the aerial drop has finished.<P>
<I>Wai 467:</I> Noel Akapita and another, descendants of Rangituhia, Rangiteauria and
Uenukumanawawiri, claimed that a block of 5,180 within the Tongariro National Park,
reaching to the
summit of Ruapehu on the south eastern side, remains Maori customary land since it was
never passed
through the Native Land Court.<P>
<I>Wai 473:</I> claim by Tom Hemopo on behalf of Te Taiwhenua o Whanganui A Orotu,
objecting
to a failure to consult Maori in the preparation of a taskforce report for Health Care Hawkes
Bay Ltd,
which recommended rationalising health care in the region by establishing a regional hospital
in
Hastings, with minimal services provided at Napier.<P>
<I>Wai 477:</I> claim by Ian Proctor that various provisions in tax legislation concerning the
keeping
of business records either require English only records be kept, or otherwise make no
provision for
Maori language to be used.<P>
<I>Wai 480:</I> claim by Sir Hepi Te Heu Heu that the draft Conservation Management
Strategy
for the Tongariro/Taupo Conservancy fails to give effect to the principles of the Treaty of
Waitangi as
required by the Conservation Act 1987. After a conference, the claim was afforded urgency.
However,
the fixing of a date for hearing is dependent on the Minister of Conservation s response to a
request to
extend the time for consultation on the strategy under s17F(j) Resource Management Act
1991.<P>

<H3> Hikaia Amohia on behalf Ngati Haua, Tama Upoko, Hinengakau, Ngati Tupoho, Ngati
Rangi </H3>
<I>Wai 146, 20 February 1995. Deputy CJ Smith</I><P>
The claimants filed a request for an urgent hearing of that part of this claim concerning a
former
marae site in Taumarunui, now the proposed site of a new police station. The tribunal stated
"Notice
is given that the Waitangi Tribunal has established a policy that no application before the
tribunal will
be heard while the applicants or any person claiming through them or supporting them are in
adverse
occupation of any land the subject of the application. It is a condition precedent to the hearing
of a
claim for urgency that the Maori occupants of the land vacate the land." Although the tribunal
had
no authority to impose an injunction to prevent building work it hoped all building would halt
pending
determination of the urgency claim. A date was set to consider whether urgency should be
given. At
the conference held on 10 March to consider urgency, the tribunal adjourned further
proceedings until
27 March to allow time for Cabinet to consider giving approval to an agreement between the
claimants and
the police. <P>
[ed: This stated policy has implications for other protests and any planned protests through the
occupation of land. It would seem to rule out the tribunal presently hearing any claim
concerning the
Moutoa Gardens, currently under occupation in Wanganui, while that occupation continues,
although
it might still hear an application for a date to be set for an urgent hearing in such a case]<P>

<H3>  Memorandum re Fisheries Allocation Claim</H3>
<I>Wai 447, 10 March 1995, CJ Durie</I><P>
In the ongoing fisheries allocation saga, this memorandum arranges a conference to set an
urgent
hearing date for this claim and outlines the issues the hearing might address. The tribunal is
proceeding
to hearing in light of a High Court minute of 7 February 1995 in which Anderson J indicated
that the High
Court would not adjourn its proceedings pending the outcome of a tribunal hearing, but
offered
no other advice to the tribunal. Anderson J in his minute also commented "[t]his Court on
various
occasions has noted in the course of conferences and applications that the type of broad and
important
constitutional issues being raised by these proceedings might well be an indication for rules or
statutory provisions allowing this Court to sit with assessors with mana and learning in matters
Maori".<P> 
The tribunal memorandum notes that the issues and remedies sought before the tribunal are
different
in any event and can be heard in a comparatively brief timespan. However the tribunal urgent
hearing, if it proceeds, will now have to consider a claim filed by the Manukau Urban
Authority and
other urban Maori groups, arguing, among other things, that there has been a failure by the
Crown
and the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission to establish a system to protect the rights of
urban
Maori (filed 22 March). <P>

Privy Council the judgment in the electoral option case on 23 December 1994. In the opinion
of the
Court of Appeal, the Privy Council would not be considering a question of "great general or
public
importance" as required by Rule 2(b) of the Order in Council 1910 concerning Privy Council
appeals.
Rather, the Council would be examining only the reasonableness or otherwise of the steps
taken to
publicise and explain the option to Maori, which was a matter of fact and degree, not of law or
principle. The court added however, "[i]t is preferable that their Lordships ... determine, if
called
upon to do so, whether they consider the question an appropriate one for them. Moreover the
appellants
should be able to apply to their Lordships for special leave relatively simply and relatively
inexpensively,
whereas the full costs of an appeal would be very heavy."<P>
[ed: this seems to be an invitation to seek special leave directly from the Privy Council. In
another
application for conditional leave, <I>Auckland Casino Ltd v Casino Control Authority and
Others</I>
(CA 181/94, 7 March 1995), the Court of Appeal similarly found no question of general or
public
importance and rejected the application. The Auckland Casino Ltd consortium included a
Maori  partner,
and allegations had been made in earlier proceedings of a failure by the control authority to
properly
consider Maori interests (see MLR August & October 1994)]<P>

<H3>Ngati Rangatahi Whanaunga (Assoc) v Planning Tribunal & A-G (on behalf of the NZ
Police)  </H3>
<I>CP31/95, 13 February 1995. Neazor J</I><P>
The applicant association had applied for review of a Planning Tribunal decision to cancel an
interim
enforcement order preventing work commencing on the Taumarunui police station site (see
MLR
February 1995). The appellants sought to have the interim enforcement order reimposed and
work
halted until their full case for an enforcement order under the RMA could be heard by the
tribunal. In
these proceedings, they sought a declaration preventing work commencing while the High
Court
considered the application for review.<P>
Held: the declaration should not be given. There was no certainty of the success of the
application
to the High Court, it not being readily apparent that the Planning Tribunal erred in its decision.
Damage to the applicants interests would not be irreparable if the work proceeded in the
meantime
(if human remains were found it was agreed by the police that work would stop, other claims
that the
environment generally would suffer were broad and put too highly). The applicants were
seeking to
use the High Court to  protect the efficacy  of the Planning Tribunal process. The court should
not
intervene to  broaden the battlefield of litigation  in this way.<P>
[ed: An interesting fact emerged in these proceedings. The police station is to be built on 3
parcels
of land, one of which is subject to a memorial under s27B State Owned Enterprises Act 1986,
which
enables the Waitangi Tribunal to order the return of that land to Maori should it judge the
claim to
be well founded. This parcel, originally taken under old public works legislation, was not
purchased
by the police (from Government Property Services) till 1990, with the s27B memorial
attached. While
the police were entitled to purchase the land with the memorial, it is a pity the implications of
the
claim were not thought about in advance. If the claim is upheld by the tribunal, the
government may
be obliged to order that part of the police station complex should be returned to the claimants.
One
can therefore understand the claimants concern to have their claim dealt with before
construction
begins]<P>

<H3>  Purification Technologies Ltd v Taupo District Council</H3>
<I>W10/95, 1 February 1995, Sheppard J</I><P>
The tribunal was asked to consider whether certain groups and persons before it, not being
parties
to an appeal, nevertheless had standing to appear. One of the groups was a local marae
committee
claiming to speak for tangata whenua of the district.<P>
Held: the RMA provides at s274 that persons having an interest greater than the public
generally may
appear in proceedings before the tribunal and that this regime is tighter than that applying
under old
planning law. If the marae committee had evidence to call bearing on the issue of the
relationship of
Maori and their culture and traditions with their ancestral land, that would give them an
interest in
the proceedings greater than that of the public generally.<P>
[ed: reiterates again the special emphasis the RMA gives to Maori concerns. The ability for the
Maori
group to gain standing is the greater when it is considered that groups such as Greenpeace and
Friends
of the Earth were refused standing in this judgment. It is possible an appeal by those groups
will be
taken however]<P>

Commission. No
23, February 1995 </H3><P>
In preparation for allocation of pre-settlement assets, the Commission (TOKM) is gathering
information
about iwi, and in the process laying down conditions defining iwi status and
representation.<P>
<I>Iwi status:</I> "TOKM has outlined the conditions necessary for validation of an Iwi.
Increasingly, though, it is relying on the criterion, "an existence traditionally acknowledged by
other Iwi 
as the final benchmark. So, if all neighbouring Iwi deny the iwi status of a claimant group, then
TOKM
will consider removing that purported Iwi from the final list of Iwi. (After four years
consultation with Iwi,
TOKM is confident that no "new" Iwi will emerge."
<I>Iwi representation:</I> "it is not uncommon for more than one group to say it has the
mandate
to represent a particular Iwi. Usually this arises when a hapu or whanau group is set up in
opposition to
the current iwi organisation because its members, rightly or wrongly, do not believe that the
existing group
properly represents their interests. TOKM has been advising iwi for some time that the best
way to resolve
this issue is to convene a publicly notified hui, with the mandate agenda clearly spelled out.
The hui must
be open to all members of that Iwi, not just to some hapu.<P>
While some Iwi members claim that such a hui would be "stacked" with supporters of the
current
executive, TOKM believes it is up to those who want to see a change in Iwi representation to
attend
the hui and put forward their representatives. TOKM will not reconsider claims from groups
who
boycott properly organised representation hui. <P>
[ed: this process in part recreates the process which was available under the now repealed
Runanga
Iwi Act. It remains to be seen if this process will set the benchmark and also provide data for
defining
Iwi for other matters such as resource management and Waitangi Tribunal claims. TOKM is
working
with Statistics NZ to improve iwi data from the 1996 census]<P>

<H3>Minerals Programme for Petroleum  </H3>
<I>1 January 1995. Energy and Resources Division. Ministry of Commerce</I><P>
This document sets out a minerals programme for petroleum created and issued pursuant to
s18
Crown Minerals Act 1991. The fundamental policy objective in managing petroleum is
efficient
allocation, a fair return to the Crown and "due regard to the principles of the Treaty of
Waitangi".
Consultation with Maori early in any allocation process is emphasised, and a procedure for
consultation
which must be followed is outlined. The programme, pursuant to s15(3)/1991 (iwi may
request that areas
of particular importance be excluded from the operation of minerals programmes or inclusion
in any
permit), identifies Mt Taranaki, Pouakai, Pukeiti and Kaitake ranges (as defined by the area of
the Mt
Egmont National Park - 33764 hectares), as areas unavailable for inclusion in any petroleum
permit, being
a fundamental source of tribal identity and mana for iwi of Taranaki, with the mountain
regarded as an
ancestor and the area generally as wahi tapu.<P>

<H3>Mabo No 3 case and social justice proposals  </H3>
<I>The Australian 17 March & 18-19 March 1995</I><P>
The High Court has upheld the Federal Government s Native Title Act and rejected a
challenge to
it from Western Australia s state government, finding that government's Land (Titles and
Traditional
Usage) Act 1993 to be invalid as contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This federal
legislation provides that laws concerning rights enjoyed by all may not deny one group on the
basis
of race. The Western Australian legislation restricted common law rights on the basis of
Aboriginality
ie denied the ability of Aborigines to properly pursue claims to traditional title under common
law.
<P>
In the same week the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation presented a report to the federal
government
titled <I>Going Forward</I>, making 78 recommendations to secure  social justice  for
Aborigines
in light of the <I>Mabo</I> case. Recommendations included making compulsory the study of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures in schools, guaranteeing 2-3 seats in the Federal
Parliament
for Aboriginal MPs, recognition in statute law of indigenous customary law, regional self
government in
the Torres Strait by 2001, official recognition of the Aboriginal flag, and adding a preamble to
the
constitution acknowledging Aboriginal ownership of Australia prior to 1788.<P>

<H3> Aboriginal Law Bulletin and Alternative Law Journal. Joint Issue </H3>
<I>Vol 3 No 72 February 1995</I><P>
This issue includes, among other articles, "Stopping the rip-offs" by Catherine Hawkins, which
comments on an issues paper recently released concerning intellectual property protection for
Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and the <I>Aboriginal Carpets</I> case where imported
carpets
featured the work of Aboriginal artists without their permission. Clan ownership in the artists
work was
recognised by the court (also considered in a case review by Terri Janke, "The Carpets Case").
"Absent
owners" by Mark Gregory examines comments from the National Native Title Tribunal that
the continued
existence of traditional title at common law may not require continued physical connection
with the land
in question. <P>

<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3> In Re Waotu South 17 & Ormsby </H3>
<I>237 Rotorua MB 250, 23 March 1995. Savage J</I><P>
In this case the court reiterated the strict legal requirements placed on trustees, by requiring
the repayment
of  salaries  and excessive travelling expenses which trustees of this land block had voted for
themselves,
but which had not been approved by the court as the trust deed required. The excessive
travelling expenses
of one trustee in particular were found to be the joint and several liability of the trustees as a
whole since
payment was made with the other trustees  consent. Payments up to $50 per trustee per
meeting was
retrospectively affirmed, in line with other trusts in the region, and pursuant to s73 Trustee
Act 1956
(court may relieve trustee of liability where they have acted honestly and reasonably), as were
some
limited travelling expenses. The trustees were ordered to file with the court a strategic and
management
plan for the future of the trust. <P>

<H2><HR>  Claim by WM Kaa and others re Maori tertiary education</H2>
<I>Wai 431, 5 April 1995. Smith J, Deputy Chairperson</I><P>
In this memo the tribunal considered a request for urgent hearing. The tribunal noted that,
despite rapid
growth in student fees from the mid 1980s, the trend was for more Maori to be participating in
tertiary
education (1.75% to 4.7% between 1988 and 1994, and Maori women up 81% between 1990
and 1994).
The tribunal observed that  [a]pplications for urgency are taken as a means of prioritising
claims for
hearing but urgency should only be afforded where there is genuine need to receive a report
and
irreversible consequences may flow from any delay in processing the claim. The granting of
urgency upon
unsubstantiated or inadequate grounds could, because of the demands made on the tribunal to
hear claims,
result in a proliferation of requests for urgency to the detriment of the administration and
management of
the hearing processes.  In the  absence of adequate grounds  to justify an urgent hearing,
urgency was
refused.<P>

<H3> Claim by Rawiri Tooke and others and a claim by Matiu Tarawa </H3>
<I>Wai 364 &  Wai 496. March 1995</I><P>
The tribunal has received two claims concerning the site of former Tamaki Girls College.
Tribunal
directions acknowledging receipt of one of the claims (Wai 364) record that further research is
required
before the matter can proceed to hearing and it is to be grouped with other Auckland-Hauraki
claims for
hearing.<P>

<H2><HR>Volcanic Plateau report </H2>
<I>Memorandum-Directions 17 March 1995. Deputy CJ Smith</I><P>
A research report on claims and potential claims in the Volcanic Plateau region has been
completed by
tribunal commissioned researcher Brian Bargh, as part of the Rangahaua Whanui project,
which aims to
provide the historical background to claims that have arisen or may arise in broad regional
areas. The
tribunal is seeking comments on the report by 30 June 1995.

<H3>Some new claims received </H3><P>
Colin Clark for Whanau O Hinemataiao Puhirere Inc representing the Ngai Tarewa hapu with
rangatiratanga over land at Onuku and the Akaroa District has filed a claim objecting to the
representative
structure for Ngai Tahu proposed in Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Bill 1993, in particular the
concept of
 papatipu runanga  (Wai 482). The claim alleges that hapu have a rangatiratanga outside the 
collective
rangatiratanga  of the papatipu runanga concept. The tribunal in directions has asked, in light
of current
remedies available, including submissions to the select committee, why the tribunal should
proceed to hear
the matter (In claim Wai 322 similar objections were raised, and the tribunal, after hearing
submissions,
declined to inquire into the claim because of alternative remedies available which might render
a tribunal
hearing premature.)<P>
J Asher on behalf of Kurauia hapu has made a claim to 57 acres of public domain known as
Tokaanu hot
springs, administered by the Department of Conservation. The claimants allege the land and
springs were
arbitrarily taken and seek the return of ownership to a trust to hold the land for Kurauia hapu,
with current
uses to continue unhindered (Wai 490).<P>
Toahaere Falkner and others have filed a claim alleging practices and policies of Bay of Plenty
Polytechnic, including the appointment process of the chief executive officer, are in breach of
the Treaty
and prejudicial to Ngati Makamaka hapu and other iwi and hapu groups in the catchment area
for the
polytechnic (Wai 497). The polytechnic is said to be an agent of the Crown. In receiving the
claim, the
tribunal has noted it has only recommendatory power and cannot delay or prevent the CEO
appointment
(Memo-directions 13 April 1995).<P>

<H2><HR> Other Jurisdictions </H2>
<H3> Greensill & Ors v Waikato Regional Council & Anor </H3>
<I>W17/95, 6 March 1995. Treadwell J, PA Catchpole, IG McIntyre</I><P>
This was an appeal from a decision of the regional council to grant consents for an oyster farm
on the
foreshore at Paritata Bay, Raglan Harbour. There were several appellants including local
Maori.<P>
Held: the positive effects of the proposal, mainly mild economic benefits to the region, were
outweighed
by potential adverse effects, including intrusion into an area used on a modest scale as a
gathering place
for kaimoana. As to matters raised by the Maori objectors:<P>
- The presence of claims before the Waitangi Tribunal can have no impact on proceedings
under the RMA,
until the Crown acts on any tribunal recommendations.<P>
- The absence of Maori consent is not an automatic veto to applications under the RMA.
Maori issues are
one among several matters to be evaluated. The council had endeavoured to provide for waahi
tapu,
although ultimately not to the satisfaction of the objectors. The term  ancestral lands  in s6
does not import
European ideas of land, including the concept of high water springs, which was alien to them.
<P>
- The definition in s7 of  kaitiakitanga is unfortunately all embracing, so that there is a
statutory definition
for a word which embraces a Maori conceptual approach, and consequently the concept of
guardianship
in s7 is applicable to any body exercising jurisdiction under the RMA (<I>Rural Management
Ltd v
Banks Peninsula District Council</I> W34/94 followed). <P>
- There is an obligation for territorial authorities to consult with the tangata whenua over
proposed policy
statements or plans (1st Schedule cl3), and the same may apply for a request for a plan change
(1st
Schedule cl25(2)(ii)), but possibly only where the plan is in the course of preparation. For
resource
consents, the territorial authority, when deciding whether a resourceconsent should be notified
or not, may
consult with those potentially affected by the exercise of the discretion, and may consult
unilaterally with
any party. Consultation may continue even after a decision not to notify has been made. An
officer of the
authority may be delegated to consult and make the decision whether to notify. These points
arise from
<I>Worldwide Leisure Ltd</I> (HC M1128/94). <P>
- Where a decision has been made to notify a resource consent, because a public hearing is
required before
the authority, to preserve fairness, it may not unilaterally consult with any party, although its
officers may
do so. Applicants are required to provide information about persons the applicant has
identified may be
affected by the proposal, and any steps taken to consult with such persons (4th Schedule
cl1(h)). If a
paucity of information is provided the authority may commission a report on the application,
which would
include review of these matters (s92). In addition, if it is clear from the application that there
are important
submissions to be made, the council officer is then  on notice  that the hearing could be
controversial, and
should seek further details. Consequently, although there are no sanctions directed against
applicants for
poor consultation, if extensive consultation is not undertaken for a consent in a sensitive area,
the applicant
runs the risk of the authority postponing matters until further information is received. There is
however
no statutory compulsion under the RMA on an applicant or a council officer to embark
unilaterally on
consultation. <P>
- In this case some consultation was undertaken, but consultation with local Maori was limited
because they
refused to allow the matter to be taken to a meeting, absolutely rejecting the idea of marine
farming in the
bay. Therefore, even if there were a statutory compulsion to consult (and there was not), the
applicant had
made "genuine attempts", and could not be expected to take the matter further. Noted, that in
the context
of tangata whenua, consultation may mean more than "having deliberations", and encompass
"taking into
consideration feelings and interests". It does not mean abandoning a project if deliberations do
not appear
fruitful.<P>
- The Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Settlement) Act 1992 had no bearing on the matter of
consultation
here, although it prevented consideration of commercial fishing interests of the tangata
whenua. The Act
is a restatement of rights, and only affects the RMA where the Minister has acted under it to
protect
customary rights, eg by way of a gazette notice preventing the granting of marine farming
licences. Noted
however that if a joint commercial venture with local Maori had been proposed, the 1992 Act
might
preclude consideration of the Maori commercial interest in the fishery as relevant to a decision
under the
RMA.<P>
- As to waahi tapu: "It appears that various members of the tangata whenua are entrusted with
details of
waahi tapu but that information is not generally shared with iwi or hapu. Thus a kaumatua may
be aware
of areas of importance within the concept of waahi tapu and may pass that information on to a
person or
persons whom he selects but the reasons for, and the importance of, any particular waahi tapu
may not
be generally known. The tangata whenua as between themselves accept without question the
concept of
waahi tapu and further accept without question the word of a person who has particular
knowledge of a
particular site or area. Thus if a kaumatua simply says that a place is waahi tapu then that is
the end of the
matter". <P>
At the council hearing submissions were made <I>in camera</I> concerning waahi tapu. The
council
moved the boundary of the proposed farming area 50 metres further seaward. The Maori
objectors said
this failed to appreciate the waahi tapu concept as outlined above. The tribunal declined to
order the
applicant out of the hearing before it, and no further evidence of waahi tapu was led.
Consequently, while
recognising the Maori reluctance on this matter, the tribunal upheld the decision of the
council, having no
further evidence to consider, stating "that tangata whenua are not a decision making authority
and cannot
simply assert a proposition and leave the Tribunal bereft of evidence to enable an acceptable
provision to
be made for protection of waahi tapu."<P>
- With regard to s8 (principles of the Treaty of Waitangi), regard must be had to evidence
showing this
was a customary Maori fishing ground.<P>
[ed: this case makes some important comments about consultation with Maori under the
RMA, and the
treatment of waahi tapu issues]<P>

<H3>Aqua King Ltd v Fleetwing Farms Ltd & Anor  </H3>
<I>W19/95, 28 March 1995. Kenderdine J, RG Bishop, JD Rowan</I><P>
Two companies had applied for consents for marine farming over the same area and both had
their
applications declined by a district council. The tribunal here was being asked to decide which
should have
its appeal heard first. A factor the tribunal considered was delays occasioned to each applicant
by
requirements from the council for further consultation with Maori. Several points of interest
were made:
- The consultation required of an applicant under cl1(h) 4th Schedule RMA when filing an
application is
more than posting the application and seeking comment, which is simply dissemination of
information and
not consultation (<I>Air NZ v Wellington International Airport</I> CP 403/91 followed).<P>
- Section 92(4) which permits a consent authority to seek further information from the
applicant to give
the authority a better understanding of the proposed project and its effect on the environment,
includes the
ability to require further consultation with iwi. <P>
- The duty on an applicant to consult is separate from the duty of consultation with iwi
required of a
council officer when considering an application. The latter duty arises under Part II and
principles of the
Treaty of Waitangi.<P>
[ed: this case adds to the comments in <I>Greensill</I> above]<P>

<H3> Tawa & Ors v Bay of Plenty Regional Council </H3>
<I>A18/95, 24 March 1995. Sheppard J</I><P>
This was a Planning Tribunal report to the Minister of Conservation concerning an application
for a coastal
permit to extract sand for building aggregates, from Otamarakau Beach. Extraction would
take place below
high water mark. A hearings committee of the regional council approved the application. Mr
Tawa and
Otamarakau Marae Trustees appealed the decision on several grounds.<P>
Held: personal meetings with Mr Tawa as representative of the trustees and an invitation for
him to call
a full meeting of trustees, which he declined to take up, constituted adequate consultation.
<I>Greensill
v Waikato Regional Council</I> (W17/95)  was referred to as supporting the view that
genuine efforts
at consultation are all that is required and absence of consent is not determinative against an
application.
The council had also approached Mr Tawa about the application. Other local tribes had also
been
approached.<P>
The presence of a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal did not affect the power to hear and
grant the
application. Nor would granting the application diminish the possibility of redress to Ngati
Makino if their
claim was found good, by revesting of the foreshore, and compensation for sand taken if need
be.
Comments to similar effect in <I>Sea Tow Ltd</I> (A129/93) referred to. <P>
The council had not acted wrongly in considering the interests of other tribal groups claiming
to have
interests in the area. Once aware of those competing interests the council was correct in
avoiding making
any preference among the iwi in its consultation process. A condition of the approval given
was that
kaumatua of all 3 iwi be given the opportunity, once extraction began, to verify whether an
area being
mined contained waahi tapu or other sites of importance.<P>
A concern that the council had inadequate resources to monitor Maori concerns was also
dismissed for lack
of evidence. <P>
Turning to other matters, the mining, if carried on within limits and terms imposed re tangata
whenua
involvement, was consistent with the proposed regional coastal environment plan - which
follows from the
NZ Coastal Policy Statement. <P>
The tribunal itself, in considering whether Treaty principles had been taken into account under
s8, noted
that the applicant was of Ngati Rangitihi descent and active on local marae, and said to be
respectful of
waahi tapu. The likelihood of bones being located in the mining area - below high water mark
- was low.
As to disputes about which tribe had mana over the beach area concerned, the tribunal should
not have
regard to disputes about which tribes properly exercise rights over areas, but focus on
sustainable
management of the resource. A statement in <I>Luxton v Bay of Plenty Regional Council</I>
(A49/94) to this effect was followed.<P>

<H3>Otorohanga Heritage Protection Group v Otorohanga District Council   </H3>
<I>A20/95, 16 March 1995.  Bollard J</I><P>
This decision, discharging an interim enforcement order, briefly records a compromise
agreement over
redevelopment of the Otorohanga Town Hall, which includes ongoing discussion with and
input from
Maniapoto people of the district. They will provide 2 representatives on a community trust
responsible for
design and development on the site. <P>

<H3> Phares & Anor v TOKM & Te Runanga o Te Whanau Tribal Authority </H3>
<I>CP389/94 HC, 23 December 1994 and 8 March 1995. Grieg J</I><P>
In the 23 December judgment, the court refused an application challenging the allocation of
leases of
fisheries quota to Te Runanga on the grounds that the plaintiffs and the hapu they represented
had not been
given an adequate opportunity to make submissions to the Fisheries Commission. The court
found that the
dispute was well known to all parties and that time had been given for further late submissions.
The court
also noted that it was not being called upon to substitute its view on allocation for that of the
expert tribunal
(the commission), and that it would be inappropriate for it to do so. In the 8 March decision,
the court
awarded costs against the plaintiffs and in favour of Te Runanga (the commission did not seek
costs), and
rejected the plaintiffs  arguments that the action was necessary to protect the interests of all
parties, little
or no disruption to quota allocation would have occurred because the plaintiffs deliberately
limited the
relief sought, and a costs order on the plaintiffs would make reconciliation within the Apanui
rohe more
difficult.<P>

challenging
allocation of leased quota that they can expect to face bills for court costs if their actions are

<H3>  Mangatu Inc & Ors v Valuation NZ</H3>
<I>LVP 22/95-33/95, 10 March 1995. MacLean J, EC Bowis, MG Cotterill</I><P>
Various Maori incorporations on the East Coast owning collectively 73,007 hectares of Maori
freehold
land valued at over $40 million, objected to a 3 yearly re-valuation by Valuation NZ, on the
basis that Te
Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 imposed restrictions on alienation which should have been
taken into
account in the re-valuation, which was fixed on the willing seller/willing buyer approach.<P>
Held: rejecting the appeal, that if, when land is sold, the buyer takes the land free of
restrictions, then
value is not affected, <I>Thomas v Valuer-General</I> (1918) NZLR 164. Other cases
quoted where
restrictions affected valuation (<I>Valuer General v Trustees Christchurch Racecourse</I>
HC
AP343/92 - a private Act was required for a sale: <I>Wanganui Racecourse Trustees v Valuer
General</I> CNZ Valuer Vol 25 1982 Report - ministerial consent required for a sale of
reserved land),
could be distinguished because the restrictions were more severe than those affecting land
under Te Ture
Whenua Maori Act where there is a "clear statutory mechanism for processing of proposed
sales and
obtaining consent." It was too early in the process of application of the 1993 Act for the
tribunal to be
convinced that the Act will have any effect in preventing sales of Maori freehold land to
non-Maori where
there is no-one in the preferred class of alienees interested and the necessary majority of the
shareholders
has been obtained. There is no persuasive evidence the Maori Land Court will use its
discretion in such
cases to not permit such sales. Accordingly the constraints under the Act are not a charge in
terms of the
Valuation of Land Act 1951 s2 which defines "land value" as the value an owners estate
would realise on
sale if unencumbered by mortgage or other charge. Noted also that Maori incorporations can
mortgage
their lands with little restriction under the 1993 Act.<P>

<H3>  Shortland v Accident Compensation Corporation</H3>
<I>269/94, ACC Appeal Authority, 12 September 1994. PJ Cartwright</I><P>
The appellant injured his knee in a farming related accident. He was awarded a sum in
compensation by
the ACC, which, on appeal, was increased by a "modest" amount to take account of a "loss of
mana"
through being unable to undertake marae associated responsibilities, which the ACC accepted
made the
effects of the injury more serious than for some other accident victim (it was argued that the
injury meant
the appellant could not stand on each occasion visitors entered the meeting house, which
marae protocol
demands). The appellant here sought an application for leave to appeal the authority s decision
as a matter
of law to the High Court.<P>
Held: granting the application, that there was a question of general importance to be
considered, namely,
how much weight cultural factors should be given in the exercise of discretion to grant further
compensation under s79 Accident Compensation Act 1982, and, if mana had been lost,
whether that loss
could be one of degree (the appellant argued that if a loss of mana was admitted, mana could
not be lost
in part only, and maximum compensation must be paid).<P>
[ed: this case is noted in light of the recent out of court settlement reached with the appellant.
The door
therefore remains open for future similar cases on cultural factors]<P>

<H3> The Maori Assembled Owners Regulations 1995 </H3>
<I>1995/83. 18 April 1995</I><P>
These regulations cover all aspects of meetings of assembled owners, including appointment,
objections
to appointment, and voting powers of proxies; postal voting and objections to postal votes;
and the conduct
of meetings. To consider and pass a resolution to sell land, a quorum and vote in favour by the
owners of
75% of the beneficial freehold interest is required. For leases, the percentage varies with the
term of the
lease:<P>
<PRE>Term             Quorum and vote in favour required
More than 42 yrs 75%
21-42 years      50%
15-21 years      40%
7-15 years       30%
Less than 7 yrs  20%</PRE><P>
A resolution to incorporate requires a quorum and vote in favour by only 15% of the
beneficial ownership,
all other resolutions require a quorum of owners representing 40% of the beneficial ownership
to consider
the matter, but not being less than 10 owners or one quarter of the owners (dead or alive)
whichever is
less. To pass the resolution, those voting in favour must hold a greater aggregate share in the
land than
those voting against (cls32-35 & cl45). The regulations also provide for meetings to consider
notices of
intention to exercise a first right of refusal from persons in the preferred classes of alienees,
where there
is a proposal to alienate an interest to persons outside the preferred classes of alienees. Clause
43 provides
that the meeting will decide upon  fair and reasonable terms and conditions  for the alienation,
then invite
persons from preferred classes who have earlier filed notices of intent, to make an offer on
those terms
and conditions. If they do, the meeting closes at that point. The regulations replace the Maori
Assembled
Owners Regulations 1957.<P>

Social
Welfare.<P>

<H3> Maori Purposes Bill 1995 </H3>
<I>No 78-1. Hon John Luxton</I><P>
This bill would make minor amendments to several acts, the most substantial being
amendments to Te Ture
Whenua Maori Act 1993 to make provision for forestry rights, as defined in the Forestry
Rights
Registration Act 1983. It is proposed to remove the requirement that the Maori Land Court
confirm a grant
of a forestry right where the grant is made by a Maori incorporation or trust constituted under
the 1993
Act. A special resolution of shareholders of an incorporation would be required where the
forestry right
was for a term exceeding 21 years. The bill also proposes removing the power of the chief
executive of
Te Puni Kokiri under the Maori Affairs Restructuring Act 1989 to make discretionary
advances or other
assistance to any Maori for the purposes of assisting them in any enterprise. It also proposes
removing the
power to appoint honorary community officers under the Maori Community Development Act
1962.
Changes to the Maori Trustee Act 1953 are also contemplated, so that unclaimed money held
in the
Common Fund of the trustee may be put into the General Purposes Fund if no claim to it is
made after 12
months. Other minor amendments concerning these funds would also be made. Submissions
close 26 April

<H3>  Crown Pastoral Land Bill 1995</H3>
<I>No 86-1. Hon Denis Marshall</I><P>
Among other matters, this bill provides that pastoral leases and occupation licences (originally
granted
under the Land Act 1948) may be reviewed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands with a view
to their
sustainable management (cl20), including the restoration to full Crown ownership and control
of land
which has  high inherent values  (ie natural resources and recreational, cultural and historical
values - cl2),
and the freehold disposal of land "capable of productive use". Appropriate public rights of
access and
enjoyment are also to be created over these lands. When carrying out these reviews the
commissioner is
to "take into account", "to the extent these matters are applicable", the objects outlined above
and "the
principles of the Treaty of Waitangi" (cl21). Preliminary proposals are to be developed by the
commissioner with the holders of leases and licences, then they must be notified, including
notification to
the iwi authority of the area (within the meaning of the RMA 1991). The commissioner must
also consult
with the iwi authority (cl25). The commissioner may then put a substantive proposal to the
lessee or
licensee, but only after having considered, all written submissions and, "all matters raised by
the iwi
authority ... during consultation" (cl27).<P>

long term
leases and licences, and has important implications for the settlement of the Ngai Tahu claim.

<H3>  Claim Settlement Proposals - recent comment</H3>
Rt Hon JB Bolger: ... the Government has extended, at Maori request, the date for the closure
of
submissions on the settlement package from 19 May to 31 August 1995. The invitation to
Maori claimants
to sit down with the Government and negotiate to resolve their claims is still on the table. ....
The
Government has not asked Maori to accept $1 billion or any other figure. The Government
has said that
it is prepared to vote $1 billion over a number of years to the Crown s negotiators to negotiate
with Maori
(NZPD 14 March 1995 p6049).<P>

<H3>  Moutoa Gardens - special debate</H3>
Hon DAM Graham: The Waitangi Tribunal completed hearings on the river aspect of the
Wanganui claim,
Wai 167, in September 1994. Its report is expected in May 1995. The lands aspect of the
Wanganui claim
is not at present scheduled for hearing by the Waitangi Tribunal before July 1995. Research is
underway
by the claimants and it is uncertain when this part of the claim will be ready for hearing. The
claim has
been the subject of direct negotiation with the Crown. On the release of the report from the
Waitangi
Tribunal, negotiations are expected to resume on the river aspects of the claim and on the
completion and
consideration of the claimants  research into the lands aspects of the claim. .... I am not sure
whether the
people who are occupying the gardens at the moment are the same people who are pursuing
the claim
before the Waitangi Tribunal. But if they are not, there is nothing to stop them from filing a
claim .... My
advice from the tribunal staff is that the river claim in fact includes the river banks. As the
gardens are
part of the banks, one would expect the claim [Wai 167] to include that as well (NZPD 16
March 1995
p6204).<P>

Contains two articles of interest:
- "'The Queen s Sovereignty Must be Vindicated'": The 1840 Rule in the Maori Land Court",
by Bryan
D Gilling (p136). Traces the origins of the the 1840 rule, which was closely related to the
issue of
sovereignty and maintaining the Pax Britannica. Also notes it was not rigorously or
consistently applied
particularly in early court determinations, he suggests partly because the court was a highly
politicised
institution, with close links to the native department and its concerns.<P>
- "Maori and the Health Reforms: Promises, Promises", by Stephanie Milroy and Annie
Mikaere (p175).
Traces a history of Maori health including the epidemics after early contact with Europeans,
through to
modern health reforms. Concludes that current reforms are failing to provide the Maori right
to have their
standard of health restored to a level comparable to that of the healthiest peoples in the world,
and to be
in control of that restoration process. Currently they are slotted into a system in which Pakeha
control and
values predominate. Suggests a more rational approach is an autonomous Maori health
structure with its
own budget and accountability to iwi.<P>

NZLR 257
in which the Court of Appeal affirmed the need for Ministers to have regard to international
obligations

<H3>Victoria University of Wellington Law Review</H3>
<I>Vol 24 No 4 Dec 1994 </I><P>
Contains two articles of interest:<P>
- "Custom law: Address to the NZ Society for Legal and Social Philosophy , by Chief Judge
ET Durie
(p325). A call for a comprehensive study of Maori law on a legal and anthropological basis,
and a brief
listing of the major features such a study would be likely to find. "... it is the experience of the
Waitangi
Tribunal that reliance on expert witnesses in ad hoc situations can produce uneven results. The
presentation
of generalised opinions by Maori elders and scholars not experienced in legal analysis also
leaves the
ultimate interpretation to untrained adjudicators without access to a coherent
lego-anthropological text."
- "The Treaty of Waitangi and the Sealord Deal" by Justine Munro (p389). Possibly the most
thorough
commentary on the fisheries settlement published to date. It concludes that the deal was a
pragmatic
response to an immediate need, but trusted in uncertain economic outcomes and failed to ask
the hard
questions which are the building blocks to legitimacy. All involved acknowledged the
settlement was not
thoroughly in accord with Treaty principles, and it deviates in important respects from those
principles.
The deal is argued to be an illegitimate extension of kawanatanga, because Maori are brought
under the
Crown s vision, exchanging a Treaty right for a Crown received title, demonstrating a Crown
inability to
accept legal pluralism. With regard to rangatiratanga, the deal follows the Crown approach of
settling on
the basis of compensation for rights lost, with a failure to focus on the objective of tribal
restoration. The
value of quota could drop, resource rentals for use of quota could rise, and quota requires
conversion, with
resources many iwi do not have, to produce a viable economic base. It is argued that the
Crown also has
responsibility for ensuring relativities among tribes. The settlement attempts to limit Crown
liabilities.
Overall the settlement represents a  wrong turn , and public debate is required over principles
appropriate
to future settlements. 
[ed: many of the points raised are relevant to the debate over the current claim settlement
proposals] <P>

<H2><HR>The Tainui Settlement</H2>
Full text of the form of apology from the Deed of Settlement between Her Majesty and
Waikato-Tainui,
signed 22 May 1995:<P>
1.   The Crown acknowledges that its representatives and advisers acted unjustly and in breach
of the
Treaty of Waitangi in its dealings with the Kiingitanga and Waikato in sending its forces
across the
Mangataawhiri in July 1863 and in unfairly labelling Waikato as rebels.<P>
2.   The Crown expresses its profound regret and apologises unreservedly for the loss of lives
because
     of the hostilities arising from its invasion, and at the devastation of property and social life
which
     resulted.<P>
3.   The Crown acknowledges that the subsequent confiscations of land and resources under
the New
     Zealand Settlements Act 1863 of the New Zealand Parliament were wrongful, have caused
     Waikato to the present time to suffer feelings in relation to their lost lands akin to those of
     orphans, and have had a crippling impact on the welfare, economy and development of
Waikato.
4.   The Crown appreciates that this sense of grievance, the justice of which under the Treaty
of
     Waitangi has remained unrecognised, has given rise to Waikato s two principles  'i riro
whenua
     atu, me hoki whenua mai'  (as land was taken, land should be returned) and  'ko to moni hei
utu
     mo to hara'  (the money is the acknowledgement by the Crown of their crime). In order to
provide
     redress the Crown has agreed to return as much land as is possible that the Crown has in its
     possession to Waikato.<P>
5.   The Crown recognises that the lands confiscated in the Waikato have made a significant
     contribution to the wealth and development of New Zealand, whilst the Waikato tribe has
been
     alienated from its lands and deprived of the benefit of its lands.<P>
6.   Accordingly, the Crown seeks on behalf of all New Zealanders to atone for these
acknowledged
     injustices, so far as that is now possible, and, with the grievance of raupatu finally settled as
to
     the matters set out in the Deed of Settlement signed on 22 May 1995 to begin the process
of
     healing and to enter a new age of co-operation with the Kiingitanga and Waikato.<P>

<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>The Ngai Tahu Ancillary Claims Report 1995</H3>
<I>27 April 1995. AG McHugh (presiding), MTA Bennett, GM Te Heuheu, IH Kawharu, GS
Orr, DJ
Sullivan</I><P>
This report deals with 117 "minor" claims raised during the hearing of the major Ngai Tahu
land and
fisheries claims, already the subject of substantial reports in 1991 and 1992. The claims range
from alleged
unjust dealings concerning thousands of acres, to loss of a few acres through uncontrolled
erosion. Because
many of these claims originated from oral testimony, without supporting research, and because
of the sheer
number of claims involved, the tribunal departed from normal procedure and further research
on the
claims by tribunal staff and the Crown was not presented at further hearings, but rather
compiled into a
draft report, which was circulated for comment. <P>
<I>Major findings</I><P>
 As already outlined in the 1991 report, large scale Crown purchases in the 1840s and the
provision of
tiny reserves left Ngai Tahu virtually landless, holding only some 35,757 acres or
one-thousandth of their
former tribal estate.<P>
 The "pitifully small" reserves were further eaten into by subsequent Crown actions. Takings
for public
  works such as defence, roading, railways, scenery preservation, recreation, without adequate,
or in most
  cases any consultation with the owners were an important source of land loss.
Individualisation of
  landholdings through the operation of native land legislation, the objectives of which were
criticised in
  the <I>Orakei</I> report, were also a major source of loss, facilitating alienation of what
was intended to be the
  tribal estate. Other factors included drainage and related works destroying fishery reserves,
and a
  statutory scheme for perpetual leases over some reserves which effectively took control away
from the
  owners.<P>
 Crown efforts to alleviate the almost total landlessness which resulted, including the South
Island
  Landless Natives Act 1906, could not be regarded as "serious undertakings". Indeed the
1906 Act was
  a "cruel hoax", with poor quality land being allocated, and some allocations never actually
being
  implemented.<P> 
 There is now an onus on the Crown to "restore a tribal endowment" to Ngai Tahu. This
could include
  vesting in the tribe the ownership of Crown owned land, including conservation lands subject
to
  management controls, and restoration of fishery resources. In negotiating a wider settlement
both sides
  should have regard to localised Ngai Tahu concerns. <P>
The report provides useful tables summarising findings and recommendations for the 100
claims
considered (17 matters being put aside because of insufficient information).  Important specific
recommendations were:<P>
 Some 6 acres of land on the Otakou peninsula at Taiaroa Head, taken under public works
legislation for
defence purposes and not returned when no longer required, should be revested in the former
owners,
subject to conditions regarding the protected albatross colony now located there (the initiative
of the local
council to vest a large part of the colony land in local Ngai Tahu was also supported);<P>
 Some 122 acres at Maranuku near Kaka point township taken for a scenic reserve should be
returned
  to the original Maori owners;<P>
 Some 592 acres at Mount Hedgehope, taken for a television transmitter site in 1964, most
of which was
  subsequently leased for forestry, should be returned to the original owners;<P>
 Persons entitled to over 1658 acres of land under landless natives legislation in blocks
allocated at
  Wanaka and Hawea, but which were never granted, should be given land of equivalent value
elsewhere;
 The Whakapoai block of 1600 acres in the Heaphy valley, set aside under landless natives
legislation,
  but never granted, should be vested in descendants of those originally entitled;<P>
 Waitutu incorporation, owning valuable indigenous forest land granted under landless
natives legislation,
  should be permitted to market timber from the land, or be compensated for loss of milling
opportunities.
  Costs to the incorporation to date of proceedings to gain permission to utilise the timber
should be
  reimbursed;<P>
 Surveys of the Port Adventure and Toitoi blocks, comprising some 17,400 acres and
allocated under
  landless natives legislation should be completed and the lands vested in persons entitled;<P>
 Tutaepatu lagoon of some 49 hectares at Woodend beach should be vested in Ngai Tahu
ownership and
  jointly managed with the Crown;<P>
 The Wainono lagoon on the Waihao River of some 335 hectares, vested in the Department
of
  Conservation, should be developed in partnership with Ngai Tahu of south Canterbury as a
traditional
  fishery resource. A similar arrangement should be reached over the Waikouaiti Lagoon of
some 61
  hectares near Hawkesbury, also owned and managed by the Department of
Conservation.<P>
<I>Treaty principles considered</I><P>
The tribunal reiterated its finding from the 1991 report that the Crown had a Treaty obligation
to provide
sufficient land for the present and future needs of the tribe in the initial purchases of NgaiTahu
lands. The
Crown also had an obligation to actively protect the meagre tribal estate which remained after
these
purchases. Because it heard no argument on the matter, the tribunal did not consider whether
the guarantee
not to disturb rangatiratanga might be overridden by the grant of kawanatanga when it came
to compulsory
takings for public works. An interesting development was a finding that Article 3 requires that
Maori land
owners must be afforded the same rights as non-Maori landowners. This comment was made
in respect
of consultation requirements for public works takings being less stringent for Maori than for
non-Maori,
and former Maori Affairs legislation which allowed "unproductive" Maori land to be taken
over and sold,
when no similar provisions existed for non-Maori land. In one claim relating to lands allocated
for landless
natives where ownership was still unresolved after 90 years despite almost continuous
negotiations, the
tribunal found a breach of the Treaty partly in the lengthy delay to achieve a settlement.<P>
<I>Public works legislation</I><P>
24 claims concerned public works takings. While the importance of public works was not
disputed, the
tribunal found fault with this legislation which, until the 1970s, failed to provide for adequate
notification
and consultation with Maori where Maori land was proposed to be taken. Nor were Maori
required to be
notified, or lands returned, when lands were no longer required for the purposes for which
they were
taken. Whether the Treaty guarantee concerning rangatiratanga prevents any compulsory
taking of Maori
land was not argued, but the tribunal commented that Treaty principles indicate that, in future,
compulsory
acquisition of Maori land should be "exercised only in exceptional circumstances and as a last
resort in
the national interest", the interest taken should be less than the freehold, and if the freehold,
then that 
question be determined by a body independent of the Crown. The tribunal also recommended
that:<P>
 the Public Works Act be amended to provide that it be interpreted and administered so as to
give effect
to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi;<P>
 Crown and local authorities be expressly authorised to acquire a lease, licence, or other
easement over,
  or enter into a joint venture arrangement in respect of Maori land required for public
purposes, instead
  of acquiring the freehold of the land.<P>
<I>Conservation land</I><P>
The tribunal made no comment on the government policy, contained in its recent settlement
proposals, that
conservation lands would be used in only limited cases to settle claims. In recommending areas
of Taiaroa
Head be returned to Maori, subject to existing conservation trusts and management, it found
that area to
fit the policy of returning only "discrete" sites. However the tribunal thought there was a lack
of
understanding on all sides of the legal options now available for joint conservation
management regimes.
It concurred with the views of a former Director-General of Conservation that Crown
ownership is not
a pre-requisite of protection of the national interest in conservation in any land. A suggested
model was
use of the Nga Whenua Rahui Kawenata regime under s77A Reserves Act 1977 allowing land
to be
revested in the Crown subject to subsisting interests. Under Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993,
ss134 (Crown
land can be revested in Maori), 338 (creation of a Maori reservation) and 340 (trustees can
include persons
from a local authority), such land can then be returned to Maori ownership, with a
management regime
for conservation values maintained.<P>
<I>Resource Management Act 1991</I><P>
The report reiterated comments of the tribunal in the <I>Ngawha geothermal</I> report that
more directive
provisions concerning consideration of Treaty principles are required in the Resource
Management Act.
However, it considered that Act as laying the groundwork for proper recognition of Treaty
rights and
noted a "perceptible change in public attitudes" in particular with the Department
Conservation.<P>
<I>Private land</I><P>
For several claims the tribunal declined to make recommendations where there were
validgrievances
because the lands concerned were now in private hands. This included some local authority
lands (a point
some councils were eager to make), although the tribunal commented that Crown owned
reserves whose
management has been passed to a local authority under the Reserves Act do not fall within the
private land
exception provided for in the 1993 amendment to the Treaty of Waitangi Act.<P>
<I>Government reserved lands policy</I><P>
The tribunal was critical of the recently announced policy to resolve claims concerning
reserved lands
under perpetual lease, saying it fell short of a just and proper settlement in requiring lessors to
wait from
42-63 years for leases to terminate and to pursue compensation claim through the tribunal
process, while
lessees were guaranteed some compensation for the loss of their perpetual rights.<P>
<I>Maori Affairs legislation</I><P>
The tribunal considered in detail one claim concerning a few acres alienated via sections 387
and 438 of
the Maori Affairs Act 1953 which allowed land deemed to be "unproductive" to be
compulsorily vested
in the Maori Trustee.<P>
No similar provisions existed for compulsory utilisation of idle European land so the
legislation breached
article 3 of the Treaty. This finding could be applied to many sites throughout the country
where this
provision was applied. In this case the land was however now in private hands, so no
recommendation was
made.<P>
<I>Future claims and hearings</I><P>
The report ends the substantive hearing of the broad Ngai Tahu claim registered as Wai 27.
However, the
tribunal noted that some matters were incompletely considered in this report, and there is no
bar on further
incidental claims being received and heard from Ngai Tahu. The tribunal also indicated a
willingness to
hold a further hearing concerning remedies, should this be required. It urged the Crown and
Ngai Tahu
to make one further effort to forward their presently stalled negotiations.<P>

<H3>  Disposal of Crown land in the Eastern Bay of Plenty</H3>
<I>5 May 1995, Wai 64 & Ors. CJ Durie for the tribunal members sitting</I><P>
In July 1994 the tribunal began hearings of the claims of Ngati Awa, Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau
and other
groups in the eastern Bay of Plenty. In the course of proceedings, the claimants sought an
early
recommendation that Crown assets in the region not be sold pending the tribunal s final
report.<P>
Found: the hearings to date had satisfied the tribunal that these groups have "significant and
compelling
claims", mainly concerning confiscations last century. These claims are unique in that;
confiscations were
large despite few Maori being involved in fighting; lands of loyal groups were taken; no
compensation has
ever been received, as it has in other districts (including the establishment of tribal trust
boards, which
have given other groups a "competitive edge"). <P>
"It is now well established in Treaty law, that compensation should be payable where serious
past breaches
of the Treaty are proven, that the return of land where practicable, is an important item in any
relief
package, and that the Crown should not divest itself of properties without a protective scheme
for
recovery, where claims justifying substantial compensation are likely to be proven." The claims
here were
likely to be proven and justify substantial compensation.<P>
While not determining the issue, the tribunal had doubts that conditions of a land banking
system proposed
by the Crown, and not yet accepted by the claimants, were "fair and reasonable" or consistent
with Treaty
principles. Conditions included a requirement that the cost of acquiring and maintaining
properties be
offset against claim settlements; that land cannot be withdrawn from the bank without Crown
consent; that
land be banked as is where is; that it is the first land used in any settlement; that a cap is set on
the value
which can be put in the bank; that the bank is reviewed every 12 months with the Crown
reserving the
right to cancel the bank and free properties for sale. The conditions as a whole create 
"impossible
situations" for claimants. A studied selection is required yet cannot be undertaken when
claimants must
respond as properties are advertised for sale. There were no difficulties concerning iwi
representation, and
overlaps in tribal interests could be readily accommodated in the interim pending a final
tribunal report.
Accordingly the disposal of Crown assets in the area without adequate protective
arrangements being in
place would be contrary to the principles of the Treaty, and no sales should proceed  at this
stage.<P>

<H3>  Fisheries Allocation Claims Wai 447 and 485, Memorandum following second
hearing</H3>
<I>22 May 1995. CJ Durie for the tribunal members sitting</I><P>
This memorandum concerned whether the tribunal had authority to hear the claim from urban
Maori
regarding the allocation of the Sealords fisheries settlement assets (Wai 485), and whether to
proceed with
a hearing in light of submissions that the commission had not yet settled any definite policy for
allocation. 
Held: despite s6(7) Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 which provides that tribunal may not inquire
into or make
any finding or recommendation on the Deed of Settlement or any enactment to the extent it
relates to
commercial fishing, "we consider that an inquiry into the urban claim does not or need not
involve an
inquiry into the Deed or a finding on whether the Deed is inconsistent with the Treaty. It calls
only for an
interpretation of the Deed, not an amendment to it. Alternatively, it is only to the extent that
the urban
claimants may call for what would amount to an amendment to the Deed that the Tribunal is
unable to
consider the urban claim." On the question whether references to "iwi" in the Deed could
encompass urban
groups, it was noted that the term was used in the Treaty Preamble to refer to Pakeha in the
sense of "the
people of a place". The equivalent for Maori "tribes" was "hapu". Therefore even though "iwi"
is now
commonly used to mean groups of common descent, it is arguable its application to urban
groups would
be a classical and not a new use of the term.<P>
Counsel for the commission had argued a tribunal hearing should not proceed because the
commission had
not irrevocably committed itself to one model of allocation with mana whenua mana moana as
a basic
principle. The tribunal canvassed conflicting information on the point and found that it was
arguable that
"mindsets had developed or policies and proposals been sufficiently established to preclude the
full and
impartial examination of alternatives or agreement on basic principles." It was also arguable
that a lack
of agreement in fundamental issues might affect the work of the commission including interim
distributions. Accordingly the hearing should proceed. <P>

<H2><HR>Other Jurisdictions  </H2>
<H3>Wanganui District Council v Tangaroa & Others  </H3>
<I>  CP 2/95, 16 May 1995, HC Wanganui. Heron J</I><P>
This action was brought against 3 persons as "ostensible leaders or spokespersons", of the
persons who,
on 28 February 1995, had abruptly occupied Moutoa Gardens, a site of just over 2 acres in
Wanganui. The
Council sought a declaration as to title and orders for possession of the site. Ancillary orders
for
injunctions were also sought to direct people to leave the site and remove buildings and other
items. The
3 representative occupiers took no part in the proceedings. The court appointed an amicus
curiae to assist
it, who put the defendants case "proactively" within the limits of that role and of time. The
Attorney-
General obtained leave to intervene.<P>
Held: Early maps, missionary accounts and photos show Paikatore pa as a river bank site
adjacent to and
a little south west of the "marketplace" - the Moutoa Gardens of today. The pa was an area
used for trade
rather than being a permanent settlement and was close by but not within the confines of the
triangle that
represents Moutoa Gardens. The Gardens site was undoubtedly included in the purchase of
land at
Wanganui by Donald McLean in 1848, following an earlier NZ Company acquisition which
had been
investigated by Commissioner William Spain. The deed of sale placed no emphasis on the
Gardens site,
although making other reserves.<P>
The Gardens became Crown land following the purchase. In 1880 the site was vested in the
Borough of
Wanganui. There was over this period a " singular absence of any suggestion that the land was
occupied
as a pah with accompanying marae"  and photographic evidence suggested "quite the
contrary" (pre-
European times, about which there was no evidence, excepted). <P>
There was however considerable trading by Maori and European on or about the area of
Moutoa Gardens.
A landing place was also required in conjunction with attendance at Native Land Court
sittings. There was
Parliamentary debate about the need for a landing site in this vicinity. Eventually an
"impracticable" area
was set aside on the river bank above the Gardens site. Documentation of these events also did
not refer
to a traditional pa with accompanying marae. In 1980 the Gardens were gazetted as a historic
reserve.
<P>
The court noted that the repeal of s158 Maori Affairs Act 1953, which prevented challenges
to Crown
grants, allowed a wide inquiry into the history of this site. It was a matter of regret however
that, being
"private land", the site is excluded from the Waitangi Tribunal s recommendatory function,
despite the
large Crown involvement in its history. <P>
Three possible attacks on the Council s apparent title were considered:<P>
 that s79 Land Transfer Act 1952 (adverse occupation) applied; there was no evidence of
actual
occupation, but rather of sporadic and shared use of the site for depositing goods etc:<P>
 that s81 Land Transfer Act 1952 (error or fraud in the title) applied; although the site was
designated
  a marketplace but never used for one, neither the council or Crown were never called on to
put it to this
  use, and such an argument goes to correction of title, rather than a challenge to it. Nor could
a trust in
  favour of Maori use be established on the evidence:<P>
 that common law aboriginal title had not been extinguished; even allowing for
Commissioner
  Spain s promise to Maori that all their pa sites would be reserved, there was no evidence on
the
  balance of probabilities that Moutoa Gardens were more than an extension of a temporary
village
  on the riverbank, as one of the defendants had in fact admitted. Other pa were at the time
clearly
  delineated on maps, and the area for Paikatore was marked as clearly outside the Moutoa
Gardens.
  The Gardens came to be a site for multiracial gatherings of importance to all people of
Wanganui.
  A Wanganui historian recalled no challenge to council ownership being recorded until 1995.
<P>
A mayoral letter to the police in March 1995 could not be construed as a licence, any
temporary
licence if it existed being well and truly revoked by this time. The Gardens had not been
mentioned
in two claims before the Waitangi Tribunal, one concerning the river and one Whanganui land,
but
there was no reason hearings of the land claim could not consider the Gardens, although
having to
stop short of making any recommendation concerning them. The court, while being aware of
"overall
treaty obligations the Courts have asked others to observe", rejected a submission that a final
declaration
as to title not be made, because of the need for finality of this urgent matter. However the
finding that the
council was the owner of the land was limited to the purpose of the proceedings, ie the finding
as to title
was not a determination of an application for relief under ss79 & 81 Land Transfer Act
1952.<P>
As to remedy, the court noted past council efforts to meet regularly with a Maori consultative
group,
and afford Maori concerns a unique position among community concerns, and the lack of any
reference
to ownership issues in those consultations prior to February 1995. <P>
Where the law is breached the court must grant remedies to litigants without fear or favour,
and
cannot weigh up the public acceptability of any order it might make, even if many desire a
negotiated
outcome. Accordingly, the council was declared the owner of Moutoa Gardens and granted an
order
for possession, making the present occupiers trespassers. The occupiers were injuncted to
leave the
land taking personal property and dismantling any structures.<P>
[ed: since this case, the occupiers have of course left the gardens and dismantled structures,
after
negotiations with the police. A claim (Wai 505, received 12 April 1994) has been filed with the
Waitangi Tribunal relating to the purchase of the Wanganui and Waitotara blocks, which
covers the
Moutoa Gardens. The tribunal is seeking further particulars and research will be required
before the
claim is heard (direction, 15 May 1995)]<P>

<H3> Banks & Anor v Waikato Regional Council & Carter Holt Harvey  Forests Ltd</H3>
<I>A31/95, 20 April 1995 Sheppard J  </I><P>
An appeal against a decision granting a resource consent to harvest pine trees and construct
temporary
roads in 268 hectares of land on the Whangamata Peninsula. The forest was a former State
forest,
now under a Crown forestry licence containing conditions regarding waahi tapu and covenants
to
protect them. <P>
Held: allegations that preparatory roading work, undertaken before the present application for
a
consent, had destroyed important sites, were overstated. Consultation with local Maori had
been
undertaken about those works and Historic Places Trust permission secured to alter sites. The
present
appeal should not be a retrospective challenge to that permission. For the present consent
adequate
consultation with tangata whenua had been undertaken. If there were conflicting claims to
tangata
whenua status in the area, the local council had no authority to decide these. The tribunal
rejected the
notion that reliable indentification of tangata whenua could be obtained from the claims
register of
the Waitangi Tribunal (the appellants having lodged a claim to the forest). Similar statements
in <I>Tawa
v Bay of Plenty Regional Council</I> A18/95 were followed. <P>
The forestry company as applicants had talked to all who claimed an interest. There was no
duty to
consult about the preparatory works in relation to the present application for consent to
harvest the
trees. The tribunal adopted conclusions in the <I>Tawa</I> case that the council as consent
authority
could not consult with tangata whenua. Council staff had adequately reported to the council
tangata whenua
concerns. <P>
After having earlier agreed to the granting of a resource consent, it was clear the appellants
had had
a change of mind and the appeal was designed to provide a vehicle for further negotiations to
achieve
more stringent conditions. In these circumstances the appeal was vexatious. Claims before the
Waitangi Tribunal could not be taken into account either in proceedings before the tribunal or
by the
consent authority. <I>Haddon</I> [1994] NZRMA 49 and <I>Greensill v Waikato Regional
Council</I> followed. 
The resource consent, containing 6 conditions specifically to protect Maori interests, was not
inconsistent
either with regional policy statements or district plans. Proposed amendments to increase the
stringency
of these conditions were all rejected, several because they looked to activities not governed or
affected by
the resource consent (eg a requirement for an archaeological survey over the whole of the
13,000 hectare
forest). The tribunal cancelled as ultra vires a consent condition requiring ongoing compliance
by Carter
Holt with an agreement between them and local Maori, since the power of consent authorities
to impose
conditions may not be used to enforce private agreements, but only for public purposes. The
term of the
consent was extended by the tribunal to take account of delay caused by the appeal.<P>


<H2><HR> General </H2>
<H3> Report of the Representation Commission 1995 </H3>
<I>27 April 1995  </I><P>
The commission largely confirmed the earlier boundaries for the 5 Maori seats except for
allowing
an objection of A Waaka and 193 others that the boundary between Te Puku O Te Whenua
and Te
Tai Tonga be adjusted to preserve the integrity of Ngati Kahungunu. Wairarapa is now fully
within
Te Puku O Te Whenua. Most of Horowhenua goes to Te Tai Tonga which now substantially
encompasses
Muaupoko and Ngati Raukawa. The boundary around the Shannon area was adjusted to allow
unification
of the Ngati Kahu iwi. The commission rejected an objection regarding the inclusion of the
Chatham
Islands in the proposed Te Tai Tonga electorate, ruling that tribal connections of the
Chathams people with
Taranaki were not the only relevant ones.<P>

<H3> Deed of Settlement. Her Majesty the Queen in right of NZ and Waikato-Tainui </H3>
<I>  22 May 1995</I><P>
This deed implements the Head of Agreement document signed in December 1995 (see MLR
Dec
1994-Jan 1995). Waikato-Tainui forgo full redress for raupatu (confiscation) losses estimated
by them
at $12 billion. A full apology from the Crown is laid out. Briefly, redress is provided in 2
forms: <P>
 Settlement properties of some 19,040 hectares will be transferred to a Waikato Raupatu
Lands
Trust, a charitable trust established by the existing Tainui Maori Trust Board. Some properties
will
be subject to lease back arrangements. If the lease terms cannot be agreed an independent
arbitrator
can be called in.<P>
 Establishment by the Crown of a Waikato Land Acquisition Trust which will have a capital
sum
  of $170 million, minus the value of the 19,040 hectares settlement properties, and various
sundry
  amounts (leaving by some estimates about $60-70 million). The capital will be transferred
over 5
  years. This trust will have a right of first refusal over freehold surplus Crown properties in
the
  Tainui claim area held by various listed Crown agencies. Legislation will provide that this
right will
  be noted on titles to these surplus properties.<P>
The deed is conditional on legislation being introduced to effect many matters, including the
removal
of resumptive memorials on titles in the claim area, the cessation of the annuity to the Tainui
Maori
Trust Board (the Board is expected to be dissolved by legislation at some future time),
discontinuance
of other  "overlapping" claims in the claim area. Tainui claims to the Waikato River (including
marginal land strips adjacent to the river), remain, as do claims to West Coast harbours and
the
Wairoa and Waiuku blocks. Waikato-Tainui Treaty rights "including rangatiratanga rights"
remain
unaffected. The Tainui mandate through the Maori Queen is noted, and the term 
Waikato-Tainui 
is defined by a listing of 33 hapu.<P>

<H3>Appeals to the Privy Council. Report of the Solicitor-General to the Cabinet Strategy
Committee
on Issues of Termination and Court Structure  </H3>
<I> 5 May 1995. Crown Law Office </I><P>
The S-G did not consult with Maori, but found most judges of the Maori Land Court opposed
to
abolition of the right to appeal, suggesting instead that the matter should be determined by
Maori,
perhaps by reference to the Waitangi Tribunal. However the S-G found abolition would have
no
practical impact on Maori opportunities to pursue claim settlements or on Crown Treaty
obligations.
If abolition occurred, provision should be made to replace present appeal rights from the
Maori
Appellate Court to the Privy Council with an appeal to the Court of Appeal.<P>
[ed: Cabinet has since made an "in principle" decision to abolish appeals to the Privy
Council]<P>

<H3>Maori Reserved Land Consultative Working Group  </H3>
<I>  10 May 1995. Minister of Maori Affairs </I><P>
George McMillan, Peter Charleton, John Larmer, Paul Morgan, and Lyn Williams were
announced
as a group to provide comment to officials on technical matters concerning the implementation
of the
government policy to settle reserved lands issues. Among other matters, they will provide
advice on
the procedure that occurs in the event Maori lessors are unable to purchase lessee
improvements at
the end of 2 further lease terms (ie 42-63 years) and on "any other issues which might expedite
the
outcomes at no cost to the Crown". The group will report in July. Legislation will be
introduced in
September 1995.<P>

<H3>  Recent speeches on sovereignty</H3>
Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations Hon D Graham; "Over the years Maori have raised
a
number of arguments against the assumption of sovereignty by the British Crown. .... None of
these
arguments has any validity. The simple fact is that the British Crown s assumption of
sovereignty,
assisted certainly in part by the Treaty, unquestionably succeeded andit has as a matter of
international
law, lasted. In other words, what is, is. A revolution in New Zealand has occurred, ...
'Revolution
rests upon what is done, not what is legal or necessarily moral or just'."<P>
PM Hon JB Bolger Gisborne 13 May 1995; "It must be clear that the Government will not
entertain
any division of sovereignty of Parliament, nor substantive power-sharing of a kind which
would
involve a Maori Parliament or separate legal or taxation systems. We do not recognise the
right of
any group of New Zealanders, ... to determine their destiny regardless of the state of which
they are
a part. We do not believe that the Treaty of Waitangi sanctions notions of Maori sovereignty
arising
from self-determination. This would be secession - the assumption of sovereign powers by a
body
which separates from the existing state. ... Understanding this, I need equally to say that the
way that
national sovereignty is actually exercised, through Parliament, is not a matter of absolutes. Its
powers
are delegated to other bodies and can be exercised in ways that mean, for certain activities, the
parties
involved substantially manage their own affairs, or co-manage them in association with the
Crown."

<H2><HR>The claim to the sea</H2>
In the context of the current debate over fishing rights and mana whenua mana moana, the
following
incident is offered for reflection.<P>
In 1955 Nga Puhi elders lodged an application with the Maori Land Court for title to Te
Moana-nui-a-
Kiwa, the Pacific Ocean. The claim was based on: rights from Tangaroa, as descendant of
Rangi and
Papatuanuku; the act of Maui-tikitiki-a-taranga in fishing the island from the sea; on Kupe
through
his voyage to the island across this ocean, and his naming of points on land alongside it; and
through
human blood which Kupe smeared on his face when fishing the island from the sea. By the
time
Europeans discovered the ocean, the applicants said, it had already been crossed many times
by Maori
and was a marae of the ancestors. This application apparently followed a pre-war petition to
similar
effect placed before Parliament but not acted upon. <P>
Perhaps to allay any government concerns, and to conform to Maori Affairs legislation, the
applicants
were seeking for the waters of the ocean to be vested in them as trustees. Since they were
British
subjects, "the world would know these waters were controlled by the British Crown".<P>
Not surprisingly, the Maori Land Court judge at Rawene felt that he lacked jurisdiction to
consider
the claim, saying the Court could only regulate disputes concerning Maori fisheries, but he
complimented
the elders on the preparation of their case. The judge was concerned that other litigants were
waiting to
be heard and limited the hearing of the case to one hour. The applicants in turn thanked the
Court for
consideration of their claim (64 <I>JPS</I> (1955) 162, <I>NZ Herald</I> 24 February
1955).<P>
It may have crossed the mind of the judge (Judge Clarke) that this application was fanciful,
although
he did not say it. But what would we say now in light of the Territorial Sea and Exclusive
Economic
Zone Act 1977 and the modern law of the sea? The Waitangi Tribunal, reflecting in recent
years on
Maori views of dominion over the seas, unconsciously echoed this earlier claim in finding that
"Maori saw the oceans as one expansive whole. Their right to it was based on ancestral
associations.
The Pacific they called Te Moananui-a-Kiwa, (the expansive ocean of Kiwa) and all
Polynesians who
relate to Kiwa are entitled to be there. A southern portion, Te Moana-a-Kupe, is held for
Kupe s
people. By ancestral connections did Maori relate even to the open seas, ..." (<I>Muriwhenua
Fishing
Report</I> 1988 p184).<P>

<H2><HR>  Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>  In Re Tataraakina C Block and Baker & Others</H3>
<I> Appeal 1994/20, 11 Takitimu ACMB 50, 18 May 1995.  Deputy CJ Smith,  Marumaru J,
McHugh
J </I><P>
This was an appeal against an order of the Maori Land Court appointing trustees to an ahu
whenua
trust under s222/1993. The block, of over 14,000 hectares, had been vested in an
incorporation. The
incorporation was wound up and application made to constitute a s438 trust under the Maori
Affairs
Act 1953. The winding up of the incorporation had taken longer than expected. The court
called a
meeting of owners, who voted to indicate their preferred trustees, and this was immediately
followed
by a court sitting at which orders under s222/1993 constituting an ahu whenua trust and
appointing
trustees were made. The appointments orders were appealed on the grounds that tikanga
Maori had
not been considered in the appointments; the court had not considered applicable statutory
requirements
in ss2, 17, 32 and 222/1993; there had been unfairness in the procedure for appointing
trustees; the court
gave undue weight to future forestry development when considering who would be trustees;
and gave
insufficient weight to relevant considerations, in particular the past record of persons
associated with the
management of the land.<P>
Held: all of these submissions should be rejected. Although the 1993 Act does not specifically
provide
that tikanga Maori be taken into account in the establishment of trusts, the Preamble and s2
made it
incumbent on the court to have regard to tikanga should the issue arise in the course of
proceedings.
In this case the selection meeting had been held on a marae, and involved face to face or
kanohi ki
te kanohi discussions, a traditional preference. Some candidates for trustee positions cited
their tribal
background and particular attributes and skills in matters Maori. <P>
In determining whether to appoint particular trustees the court must, in addition to other
matters, be
satisfied the appointment is "broadly acceptable" to beneficiaries (s222(2)(b)/1993). This can
be
interpreted to mean "widely or generally acceptable". Holding the special MLC sitting
immediately
following a meeting of owners is not a common practice, and should be approved only where
special
reasons warrant it. But there were no controversial issues to be dealt with at the meeting of
owners,
and the principal purpose of the meeting, to appoint trustees, had been well notified and
awaited for
some time.<P>
The MLC was justified in its view that one major shareholder s influence on election results
was
excessive by reason of her large interests in the land, and it had not acted unfairly in
mentioning to
the meeting that it had a duty to guard against tyranny by majority shareholders when
considering the
results of votes cast. The MLC was justified in assessing the election results not only on the
number
of shares cast for each candidate but also the number of owners who voted for each candidate.
<P>
A procedural point: although the application for a trust order was made under s438/1953 and
the
MLC was entitled to make the trust orders under that provision, it was able of its own motion
to
invoke s215/1993 to create the trust. Section 37(3)/1993 confers this power. It was also
ordered,
pursuant to s86/1993, that the trust orders made by the MLC should be amended to record
that they
had been made under ss222, 215 and 220/1993.<P>

<H3>  Mourea Papakainga 3D v The Maori Trustee</H3>
<I>240 Rotorua MB 212, 26 May 1995. Savage J  </I><P>
The Maori Trustee was the owner under a s438 trust (now ss215, 220/1993) of Maori
freehold land
at Lake Rotoiti on which there is a resort hotel. The land was mortgaged, and due to financial
difficulties the mortgagees sought to sell the land. The Maori Trustee arranged a rescue
package
whereby various Maori land trusts were to lend money, secured by way of another mortgage
over the
land. Two of the trusts failed to lend money as expected. At the 11th hour, the Maori Trustee
stepped
in and advanced money to the non-lending trusts. The mortgage document was not altered
however,
and recorded that the non-lending trusts were mortgagees. Some months later the Trustee
entered a
term loan contract with itself as borrower, granting security to itself by way of the mortgage.
Now
the Maori Trustee sought an order that the 2 non-lending trusts held their interest in the
mortgage in
a fiduciary capacity and that that interest be vested in the Trustee accordingly pursuant to
s18(1)(i)/1993.
The trusts for their part sought vesting orders under s239/1993 so that a discharge of the
mortgage could
be executed.<P>
Held: s18(1)(i) refers only to whether "land" is held in a fiduciary capacity, and that word does
not
extend to include an artificial legal interest such as a mortgage. However, the matter could
dealt with
under s18(1)(a) which allows interests to be determined, but does not permit a vesting order
to be
made. There was no evidence the lending trusts knew the Trustee would be involved until
after
execution of the mortgage. An arms length commercial transaction will rarely give rise to a
fiduciary
relationship. The Trustee had set up a commercial transaction but had not brought the other
lenders
including the non-lending trusts into the picture. The mortgage secured interests in the land
only for
the lending trusts.<P>

<H3>  Ngati Awa and other Bay of Plenty claims</H3>
<I>  Wai 46 and others. Memo following 6th hearing, 8 June 1995. CJ Durie for the
coram</I><P>
Dealing with overlapping claims in the region, the tribunal declined for the time being to make
any
determination on customary boundaries, but commented on the sort of issues such
determinations
raise. "What weight should be given to ancestral associations that have endured over
numerous
generations and what weight to the outcome of more recent battles? If more weight is to be
placed
on the luck of the last encounter, then what should be regarded as the final and determinative
victory?"
If a date were fixed there would also be a need to consider "whether battles were more
indicative of
aberrations than the norm, and whether the true test was who lived where, at the relevant time,
and,
having regard to the many ramifications of Maori whakapapa and the people s ability to
connect with tribes
on several sides, to whom did those people most align?" As for the relevant time, should 1800
(before
western influences made any change), 1840 (British sovereignty), or 1865 (effective
enforcement of British
sovereignty in the Bay of Plenty region), be used, or even 1995 "in order to accommodate
modern
preferences and to recognise that customary society was always changing and has to be
updated to meet
current needs?" As for the proper approach to consultation where overlapping claims exist, for
Ohiwa
harbour and Whakaari (White Island), the tribunal recommended consultation with all runanga
or trusts
boards of iwi claiming overlapping interests.<P>

<H3>  NZ Maori Council & Ors v Attorney-General & Ors (No 3)</H3>
<I>  CP 942/88 HC Wellington, 28 April 1995. McGechan J</I><P>
In this decision the court awarded most of the applicants costs for bringing the application for
judicial
review to prevent the transfer of broadcasting assets until Maori interests had been protected.
Although
they ultimately lost the case the Maori applicants had been "substantially successful", in
stimulating
protection for radio and achieving a $13 million funding undertaking for Maori television.
McGechan J
commented: "The case was substantially successful. It was brought in the public interest. It
should not
be regarded as relevant only to Maori. All sectors of society have an interest in the
preservation of the
culture of all; to the enrichment of all. It is better that sectors in society know it is possible to
afford
lawyers, and to use the Courts; rather than believe such is impossible, and use the streets. In a
proceeding
of wide significance, brought in the public interest, it can be appropriate for the public to
contribute very
substantially."<P>

<H3>Greensill & Others v Tainui Maori Trust Board  </H3>
<I>M117-95, HC Hamilton, 17 May 1995.  Hammond J  </I><P>
The plaintiffs (12 individuals), challenged the ability of the trust board to enter a deed of
settlement
with the Crown based on the Heads of Agreement signed in December 1994 on the basis that
13 of
16 trust board members had been invalidly appointed and that the board had no appropriate
mandate
for the prospective settlement. They sought injunctions restraining the board from claiming a
mandate
to enter into a settlement with the Crown and from entering into the contract of
settlement.<P>
Held: in essence, the plaintiffs were arguing that the mandate had to be determined by the kind
of
processes and mechanisms laid down by the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. Yet the Heads of
Agreement
prescribed no particular method for procuring a mandate. The trust board could have
proceeded either
"on traditional Maori lines until some kind of consensus emerged", used Trust Boards Act
procedures,
or held a referendum. It chose a multi-faceted approach. There was no single right answer.
The board
utilised a method which was democratic, but also used traditional Maori processes to some
extent. The
overall nature of the response to securing a mandate was the important thing. It was noted
that a number
of hui had been held at which people had voted to support the negotiations and the proposed
settlement,
and a postal referendum was held among 11,600 beneficiaries of the board with over 4,600
votes returned,
which supported the proposed settlement by almost 2 to 1. The overall percentage of votes
cast may have
been disappointing but was probably comparable with returns for local body elections. The
plaintiffs claim
accordingly foundered at the outset as there was no underlying or cognizable right which
could be
enforced. Nor was the court convinced the plaintiffs individually had standing to bring this
application. A
third factor was the nature of the agreement itself. The Heads of Agreement was a purely
political
document and as such not justiciable. Nothing was to be effected without an Act of
Parliament. For the
court to intervene now "would be an outright interference in what is nothing more or less than
an ongoing
political process; as opposed to a distinct matter of law" (<I>Sealord</I> case [1993] 2 NZLR
301
and <I>CREEDNZ Inc v G-G</I> [1981] 1 NZLR 172 followed). <P>
Even apart from these considerations, the court would not have exercised its discretion to
grant a
remedy, firstly because there was "some force" in the submission arguing there had been
undue delay
by the plaintiffs, making these proceedings into a last minute "ambush". Secondly, no
irreparable
harm would be suffered by the plaintiffs, since the final settlement would be dependent on the
passage
of legislation. The invalidities in trust board appointments were minor, and remediable under
the
Trust Boards Act. The balance of convenience overwhelmingly favoured ongoing consultation
and
negotiation. Considering the overall interests of justice, there was a compelling national
interest in
moving forward and not "putting the clock back several years".<P>
[ed: a Deed of Settlement between the Crown and Tainui iwi was signed in May, as has been
widely
reported (see <I>Maori LR</I> May 1995). The Waitangi Tribunal held a conference on 16
June to
consider whether to give an urgent hearing to a claim by the Wi Taka whanau of Ngati
Kohiriki
challenging the settlement as it relates to Ngati Kohiriki lands in the Maramarua forest.]<P>

<H3>  Re Castle (deceased)</H3>
<I>  M1243/93, HC Auckland, 20 February 1995. Thorp J</I><P>
The deceased made a will in 1988 in which he purported in several clauses to leave various
interests
in Maori freehold land to a trust. At his death in March 1991 however, he had not established
the
trust. A subsequent draft will, not executed, supported this conclusion. It provided that a trust
of the
kind intended in the 1988 will was to be established in the event the deceased died without
creating
it himself. The court was asked to determine the legal effect of the uncertain clauses. <P>
Held: considering first whether there was another trust which could be shown to be the
intended
beneficiary of the provisions, a s438 trust created by the deceased before his death to deal with
land
of the family could not fulfil this requirement since it was concerned with management and
development
of the land, and not the particular matters referred to in the several clauses. <P>
As to whether the will itself created the necessary trust, the clauses failed to achieve certainty
as to
theobject of the trust. The deceased, in referring to "members of the Castle family" had not
established
the class of beneficiaries sufficiently. Precedent showed that references to "family" are too
vague and in
this case it was impossible to know how far lineally or laterally the word was intended to
extend
(<I>Yeap Cheah Neo v Ong Cheng Neo</I> (1875) LR 6 PC 381 and <I>Re Brewis</I>
[1946]
VLR 199 followed). Nor did the will indicate a sufficiently clear purpose for the trust. It may
also have
breached the rule against inalienability. <P>
Accordingly the challenged dispositions failed and the property fell into the residue of the
estate and
passed to the widow. While this was regrettable, the sudden death of the testator before
effecting
changes to the will prevented any other conclusion. The widow, having in mind the intentions
of the
testator, might effect a settlement more in keeping with the wishes of the deceased than any
court
solution based on reconstruction and reformulation of the relevant parts of the will. <P>
[This and other cases on dispositions of Maori land by will are discussed in the <I>Taitokerau
Maori
Land Court Newsletter</I> 23 June 1995 (Vol 7 No 6), which notes that, had the testator
died after 1
July 1994, the widow would not receive the interests which fell to the residue, unless she were
of the same
hapu as the testator.]<P>

<H3>  Hauraki Maori Trust Board & Anor v The TOKM & Ors</H3>
<I>  CP 562/94, HC Auckland, 24 May 1995. Anderson J</I><P>
The trust board requested that the court state a case to the Maori Appellate Court  under s61
Te Ture
Whenua Maori Act 1993 concerning tikanga Maori as it relates to fisheries. The trust board
has
argued that the Fisheries Commission had wrongly allocated deep water fishing quota for the
1994-95
fishing season to Tainui iwi in an area where they have no mana over the coastline.<P>
Held: the High Court has jurisdiction to refer such a matter to the Maori Appellate Court
(MAC).
A liberal interpretation of s61 shows it can encompass questions of mana in respect of land
and issues
of mana and rohe in connection with waterways, including coastal waters and seas. It may be
the only
way such fisheries issues can be efficiently and appropriately determined. The Maori Land
Court, the
MAC in its appellate jurisdiction and the Waitangi Tribunal may have limitations in this area of
Maori
concern; the general jurisdiction of the MLC and MAC being limited to land and
representation
issues, and the tribunal to issues between the Crown and Maori. <P>
However, the High Court declined to exercise its discretion and state a case for the time being,
because in giving a decision on the question proposed the MAC might indicate a view on the
concept
of mana whenua mana moana, a matter which is the subject of current extensive debate and
litigation.
There would be a clear implication that an allocation of fisheries resources by the Fisheries
Commission
might be invalid if inconsistent with a concept of mana whenua mana moana. The High Court
would be
prematurely giving a weighting to one of the 3 general factors to which the Commission must
have regard
when granting assistance to Maori groups, namely: Maori custom, economic considerations
and social
considerations. "The debate is too important for it to be polished before its true shape is
known." Current
proceedings can continue on the assumption that the plaintiffs have mana of certain coastal
areas where
the Tainui iwi concerned do not. If in due course the correctness of those assumptions would
be decisive
to the plaintiffs claim, then it would be appropriate to state a case.<P>

<H3>  Surplus Crown properties within Raupatu boundaries</H3>
<I>  Office of the Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations 31 May 1995</I><P>
Sales of surplus Crown properties within the Taranaki, Tauranga, Bay of Plenty and
Mohaka-Waikare
confiscated areas have been stopped. The Crown has accepted that further sales would
prejudice
negotiations to settle outstanding raupatu claims. Claimants often seek the return of these
lands, and
see continued sales as reducing the Crown ability to settle claims.<P>
[Ed: this implements the Waitangi Tribunal report and recommendation of 5 May 1995 that no
further
sales of surplus lands in the Bay of Plenty should occur while claims are pending (<I>Maori
LR</I>
May 1995), but also goes considerably beyond it. The Office of Treaty Settlements advises
that under this
policy Crown agencies will continue to be able to "sell" surplus properties in a technical sense,
but
they will be purchased by the Crown itself and placed in a Crown Settlement Portfolio. Details
of the
funding for this policy and valuation matters are still being worked out. The raupatu
boundaries are
the confiscation boundaries gazetted under confiscation legislation (NZ Settlements Act 1863
and
others) of last century. Two small areas not part of the recent Tainui settlement are also
included. The
announcement indicates that sales could occur if the relevant claimant gives consent.
Identifying the
relevant claimant could be problematic.]<P>

<H3>  Changes to Electricity Generation and Power Station Ownership</H3>
<I>  Media release 8 June 1995. Ministers of Finance, Energy, State-Owned Enterprises and

The government has made a decision in principle to establish a new state owned enterprise
(SOE) to
compete with the Electricity Corporation of NZ (ECNZ) from 1 February 1996. As part of the
arrangements ECNZ will progressively sell six small hydro stations to regional power
companies or
Maori interests. These stations are not part of ECNZ s main hydro systems. They are Cobb,
Coleridge,
Highbank, Matahina, Mangahao and the Waikaremoana group of stations (Tuai, Paripaua,
Kaitawa).
Eligible buyers will be invited to make commercial bids for the stations. If no suitable bids are
received
they will be transferred to the new SOE at book value. "The creation of the new SOE will not
alter the
Treaty of Waitangi-related protections that currently apply to ECNZ s assets. In addition, the
Treaty-
related memorials currently protecting land associated with the six stations will remain in place
following
the proposed sales. Final decisions on both the establishment of the new SOE and the sale of
small hydros
will be made after appropriate consultation with Maori."<P>

<H3>  Reflections on the formal definitions of Maori</H3>
<I>  NZ Law Journal May 1995. Jeremy McGuire </I><P>
Questions the usefulness of the term "Maori" as a descriptive category. Wonders whether the
present
definition based on ancestry is appropriate and whether qualitative criteria should be used such
as
knowledge of and participation in iwi activities, and evidence of a commitment to and
participation
in Maori culture. Questions whether Maori can be said to be tangata whenua of NZ when for
most
intents and purposes they have "effectively adopted and embraced traditional non-Maori
culture such
as capitalism and its incidents and a passion for non-Maori sports such as rugby league, rugby
union
and netball." Notes that human beings are notorious for labelling and classifying people into
categories
depending upon "how they <I>look</I> and what they are perceived, often misguidedly, to
<I>represent</I>." Argues that the definitional question is becoming more acute in light of a
developing resentment from non-qualifiers to benefits arising from the application of the
principles of the
Treaty of Waitangi by the courts and Parliament. Concludes that, "if a genuine difference
between Maori
and non-Maori groups is justified, that is if the distinction accurately reflects social reality,
then it provides
one justification for the current approach".
[ed: To put this article in a context (which, with respect, it seems to lack), it may be worth
recording
that in April 1995 the Hon Phil Goff asked the Minister of Justice "In light of the fact that
more than
three quarters of all youth offenders in Northland last year were Maori, what actions, if any, is
he
and his department taking to address the causes of this problem?" The Minister replied: "The
Department
of Justice is part of a focus group on the issue of offending by Maori. ... This group is to
report to cabinet
on the factors that contribute to the disproportionately high levels of reported offending by
Maori and the
over-representation of Maori within the criminal justice system. It will identify existing policy
and service
delivery initiatives with the potential to reduce the levels of offending by Maori and the over
representation
of Maori within the criminal justice system and make proposals as to culturally appropriate
policy
development and service delivery mechanisms" (Replies Supplement 18 April 1995).]

<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3> In Re Cleave and Part Orokawa 3B Block </H3>
<I>Appeal 1995/5, 22 May 1995. Deputy CJ Smith, Hingston J, Savage J  </I><P>
An appeal against a refusal of the Maori Land Court to change the status of a block of Maori
freehold
land to General land under ss135 and 136/1993. The appellant was the sole owner of the
block. <P>
Held: there are 5 conditions in s136(1) which must be separately satisfied before the court may
approve a change of status. The finding of the lower court, that it was not satisfied the land
could be
managed or utilized more effectively as General land (s136(1)(d)), should be upheld. There
was no
evidence before the lower court that the land would be more effectively utilized as General
land. A
commission being paid out to the Maori Trustee under an existing lease over the land would
not be
ameliorated by a status change, since the commission was a term of the lease unaffected by the
status
of the land. A submission that, since the land was in sole ownership other persons could not
comment
on the status order, was rejected.<P>
In considering its discretion under s135 the court must have regard to s2 (interpretation of the
Act
generally) and s17 (general objectives of the Act). These provisions in combination place a
clear
requirement on the court to recognise that the retention of Maori land, its utilisation for the
owners,
their whanau and hapu must at all times be a primary matter to be taken into account. The
restrictions
and requirements in those provisions must have primacy wherever a discretion is exercised,
unless
it is clear they are ousted. "We go so far as to suggest that any order sought of the Court the
effect
of which could endanger the continued relationship with the land of the whanau and hapu
associated
with it must be treated as being of grave concern." Section 135 is a provision capable of
endangering
the relationship. It would be unwise and not in accord with the Act to hear a change of status
application
without involving preferred classes of alienees by way of formal notice directed by the court.
If there are
objections from members of the preferred class to the status change, there must be
"compelling reasons"
for the court to make the order. <P>
[ed: an important comment on the change in emphasis under the 1993 Act towards the
retention of
Maori freehold land in Maori hands.]<P>

<H3>  In Re Maxwell and Maruata 2B2 Block</H3>
<I>  Appeal 1994/9, 16 September 1994. Hingston J (presiding), Carter J, McHugh J</I><P>
Following a meeting called by the Maori Land Court of owners of land under a trust, the court
gave
orders replacing a trustee, but failed to give adequate notice to that trustee that the court
might
consider her replacement. Specifically:<P>
- In making orders calling for a meeting of owners to  review  the trustees, the court did not
indicate
that replacement would be considered. <P>
- The court had required personal service of notice of the meeting of owners to the affected
trustee,
but she had been served by ordinary post. <P>
- In the hearing in chambers, following the meeting of owners which voted to replace the
applicant
as trustee, the court had given no notice that it would exercise jurisdiction under ss239-240 to
remove
a trustee. <P>
Nor had the court stated by what authority it invoked its powers under ss239-240, since there
was no
application before the court in relation to those sections. The appellate court assumed
s37(3)/1993 had
been invoked which allows the MLC in the course of proceedings to exercise any other part of
its
jurisdiction of its own motion. However, if this approach was to be used, notice to affected
persons
was still required, <I>Coates v Gillanders-Scott & Ors</I> [1981] High Court Gisborne
M45/78
applied.<P>
[ed: although dated September 1994, this decision has only just come to hand.]<P>

<H3>  In Re Tararua District Council</H3>
<I> 138 Napier MB 104, 30 June 1995. Hingston J, H Hohepa, S Jones </I><P>
In a decision of 1 October 1994 (see <I>Maori LR</I> Nov 1994 p2) the court recognised
that both
Ngati Kahungunu and Rangitane have interests in the Tararua district, and both groups should
suggest
names of persons for appointment under s30/1993, to represent them in resource management
and
other matters before the district council. The court here briefly noted that only Ngati
Kahungunu had
put forward names of representatives, and duly appointed those persons under s30/1993.
Rangitane
refused to abide the court directive of October 1994 and put no names forward. The court

its disappointment and granted leave for Rangitane to reconsider within 6 months. It noted
that the
Kahungunu appointees had Rangitane tatai or family connections and would be responsible for
upholding the interests of all tangata whenua of the region. Their appointments were to be
reviewed
in 3 years.<P>

this
application, the district council is, for now, legally obliged to consult only with the Kahungunu
appointees.]<P>

<H2><HR> Waitangi Tribunal </H2>
<H3> Te Whanganui-A-Orotu Report 1995  </H3>
<I> Wai 55, 13 June 1995. WM Wilson (Presiding), MA Bennett, JH Ingram, MB Boyd, GM
Te
Heuheu </I><P>
In November 1851, three hundred Maori signed a deed of sale with the Crown for land at
Ahuriri
for 1500 pounds. The key issue in this claim was whether that purchase had included the bed
of the Whanganui-a-
Orotu lagoon, a shallow area of water comprising about 9500 acres, and a rich source of food
for local
Maori. The lagoon s non-Maori name is the Napier Inner Harbour.<P>
Letters of the land purchase officer, Donald McLean, and the missionary William Colenso,
supported
the view that the bed of the lagoon had been included, and Maori had sought to retain fishing
and
canoeing rights. Against this, there were oral comments by Maori, both before and after the
purchase,
recorded by European writers, that the lagoon had been excluded. The tribunal contrasted
strong
submissions from the claimants about the status of oral evidence with Crown arguments that
oral
evidence (as opposed to oral "traditions") should be tested as thoroughly as documentary
evidence.
The deed of purchase and a map accompanying it were also closely examined. The tribunal
concluded
that Maori had not intended that the bed of the lagoon be included in the sale and that the
Crown had
breached Treaty principles in not making it clear that it considered the bed was included in the
purchase and in relying on legally ambiguous documents to assert its title. <P>
In 1916, in the face of several Maori petitions, the Crown became hesitant about its title to the
bed
of the lagoon, admitting that the 1851 deed did not in words encompass the area (although it
believed
the plan did). It began to rely on the argument that, because it was an arm of the sea, the
lagoon was
in Crown ownership in 1851 by virtue of a common law presumption. The matter was referred
to a
judge of the land court for special inquiry in 1934. His report was not made public until 1948.
He
found that the greater part of the lagoon was not included in the purchase, but had insufficient
evidence to decide whether it had been an arm of the sea or not. In 1949 the Crown informally
offered 4500 acres to Maori to settle the claim. The offer was rejected as inadequate.<P>
The tribunal found that physical evidence suggested the lagoon had probably been only partly
an arm
of the sea and thus a common law argument for prior Crown ownership failed. It also
concluded that
for the Crown to deprive Maori of a taonga by common law presumption was a breach of the
Treaty
principle to actively protect Maori in their property rights. <P>
The Napier earthquake of February 1931 raised some 1406 acres of the lagoon bed. While
there had
been some reclamation prior to this, leading in 1861 to the first assertion by Maori to
continued
ownership of the bed of the lagoon,  after 1931 reclamations commenced on a large scale.
Maori
however continued to use what waterways remained until the 1970s to collect an ever
dwindling
supply of sea food. It was noted that, even today, without constant pumping the uplifted area
would
revert to a shallow lagoon. <P>
The reclamation works also involved the compulsory acquisition of former islands which had
been
reserved to Maori in the 1851 purchase. It appears no compensation was paid under the Public
Works
Act as no claim was made for it. The tribunal considered this was probably because Maori
were at
the time investigating other avenues to pursue their full claim to the bed of the lagoon.<P>
The Ahuriri Farm settlement and Hawke s Bay airport had subsequently been established in
the
uplifted area. In 1986 the farm settlement land was divided between the Department of
Conservation,
which received environmentally sensitive areas, and Landcorp, which retained commercially
viable
farm areas. The Landcorp land is subject to memorials allowing the tribunal to make a binding
recommendation for its return to Maori if a claim to it is judged to be well founded. Other
areas of the
former lagoon were under harbour board leases. Following local government reorganisation,
empowering
legislation was passed permitting the sale of those leases. Concern about these sales had led to
the tribunal
giving this claim an urgent hearing. <P>
The tribunal examined the history of pollution of the lagoon and harbour from industrial and
domestic
sources and noted the effects on fisheries important to local Maori. It also examined
environmental
management, concluding that discussions in the 1970s over preserving the lagoon had taken
place in
a monocultural legal environment. The 1980s brought greater consultation with local Maori
with the
passing of the Environment and Resource Management Acts making specific reference to
Maori
issues, however the tribunal questioned whether the new structures adequately protected
Treaty rights,
and reiterated the finding of earlier reports (eg <I>Ngawha Geothermal Resource Report
1993</I>)
that the Resource Management Act breaches the principles of the Treaty in failing to require
decision
makers to act in conformity with the Treaty.<P>
The tribunal rejected an argument that the 1993 amendment to the Treaty of Waitangi Act
1975,
preventing it from making recommendations for the return of private land, did not apply to
claims,
such as this one, lodged prior to the enactment of that amendment. It also noted that the port
company
and local authorities must be considered private landholders under that amendment. <P>
Final recommendations await a further hearing later in the year, but the tribunal indicated that
the
Crown should not in the interim sell any lands within the 9500 acre former lagoon area, and
should
consider returning Landcorp and Crown properties in that area, and provide a fund for
monetary
compensation for past losses, including the compulsory acquisition of former islands. A fresh
resource
management regime for the area should be developed and legislative changes made to ensure
there
is conformity with Treaty principles in environmental decisionmaking and any future public
works
takings. <P>
The report also dealt with submissions by Ngati Pahauwera, a local iwi which claimed
overlapping
interests in the lagoon. The tribunal noted that the group claimed occupation rights through
whakapapa
links to the Wai 55 claimants, rangatira rights (a Pahauwera rangatira was said to have signed
the 1851
deed), rights through ahi ka and rohe definition, and through ringakaha (the argument being
that
Pahauwera helped defend the region against invaders, thus confirming their tangata whenua
status). The
tribunal rejected the claim, noting that while whakapapa links existed, they were not strong,
and that
Pahauwera names did not appear in the many petitions lodged about the lagoon. The tribunal
considered
any use Pahauwera made of the lagoon in the past depended on "whanaungatanga" rights,
which are in
the nature of a "licence to use" granted by the tangata whenua.<P>
[ed: the tribunal found that the bed of the lagoon was definitely not sold. An alternative not
developed
in the report is that, even assuming the Crown did get the underlying title (and some evidence
was
noted for that point of view), the Crown agreed that substantial customary rights would
continue, and
subsequently took those rights without compensation. McLean stated at one point that he
thought a
clause retaining to Maori free access to the harbour was unnecessary in the deed because "they
are
in a treaty with the Crown". He admitted afterwards that Maori had been concerned to reserve
fishing
rights. These rights were the ones most consistently asserted by Maori both during and after
the
purchase.<P>
The report confirms the trend for the tribunal to find that the Crown will be in breach of the
principles of
the Treaty where it relies on common law presumptions which deprive Maori, without
compensation, of
rights guaranteed under the Treaty of Waitangi.] <P>

<H3>Jackson & Ors v A-G & Paraparaumu Airport Ltd & Ors</H3>
<I>CP 149/95, High Court Wellington, 30 June 1995. Neazor J</I><P>
The plaintiffs were some of the descendants of the original owners of the Paraparaumu airport
lands,
who had had their land taken by proclamation under public works legislation. They sought an
injunction
to prevent the transfer of the airport land by the Crown to a wholly Crown owned airport
company
(COAC). It was intended that shares in that airport company would be on-sold to another
company which
would run the airport. The Crown acknowledged that, because the land would continue to be
used as an
airport, it was using this mechanism to avoid s40 Public Works Act 1981 requiring an offer
back at market
value to descendants of the original owners when land is declared surplus and sold. The
plaintiffs
themselves were near to reaching an agreement with an unsuccessful tenderer for the airport
company
shares, which would have enabled the plaintiffs to buy back the land.<P>
Held: an injunction would not be granted. The evidence was clear that the land would continue
to be
used as an airport. The court rejected as speculative the allegation that the company buying
shares
from the COAC would not continue to use the land as an airport. In any event, the Airport
Authorities Act
1966 s3A(6A) provides that the COAC would hold the land as if it were the Crown for the
purposes of
offer back provisions of the Public Works Act. Accordingly, offer back requirements would be
triggered
if, while the COAC held the land, an attempt were made to dispose of it or other events occur
where s40
would normally apply.<P>
[ed: when questioned on the matter in the House the Hon Maurice Williamson commented:
"The
major portion of the aerodrome land was acquired for a public work between 1939 and 1954
under
the Public Works Act 1928. Of the 15 blocks acquired, totalling approximately 130 hectares,
one
block of 34 hectares was acquired from the Maori Trustee. The 14 remaining blocks were in
freehold
title, some owners being Maori. .... The Ministry [of Transport] has had three meetings with
representatives of former Maori freehold owners and explained fully the sales process and the
continued protection of offer back rights. The Ministry therefore considers it did its best to
settle the
dispute with the former owners before the sale." Replies Supplement 11 July 1995
p37-38.<P>
The Waitangi Tribunal has suggested takings of Maori freehold land for public works may be
in breach
of the Treaty unless stringent pre-taking criteria are followed for negotiation and investigation
of
alternatives (<I>Te Maunga Railways Land Report 1994</I> and <I>The Ngai Tahu Ancillary
Claims Report 1995</I>). It has suggested that the Public Works Act be amended to provide
that actions
taken under it must be in accord with the principles of the Treaty. The Government is
currently preparing
policy on this area.]<P>

<H3>Te Waka Hi Ika O Te Arawa and Ors v TOKM & Ors  </H3>
<I>  CP 395/93 and others, 30 June 1995. Conference minute of Anderson J</I><P>
At this hearing the court made various housekeeping orders in relation to the fisheries
litigation, and
also ordered that the court would determine as a preliminary issue: "Is the Treaty of Waitangi
Fisheries
Commission, in the exercise of its power to allocate presettlement assets as set out in s9(2)(1)
of the Maori
Fisheries Act 1989 (as amended by s17(1) of the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claim)
Settlement Act
1992) required to allocate those presettlement assets solely to iwi and/or bodies representing
iwi or groups
of iwi?" This question arises because the "urban Maori" applicants (CP 122/95) argue that the
assets
should in some cases be allocated directly to persons or entities without tribal connection.
Area One
Consortium opposed a preliminary determination. The court recorded that while it will hear
argument at
this preliminary stage, it may still decide to defer a ruling to a later stage of the litigation. <P>
The court noted, "it is now known publicly that certain parties to the litigation have been
conferring
with a view to reducing or avoiding litigation", and accordingly ordered that, apart from the
question
to be referred for preliminary determination, all other proceedings were to be suspended for 3
months, with leave to revisit the suspension if required.<P>
[ed: the High Court is also presently hearing an application challenging the Waitangi Tribunal
determination that it has power to hear claims in a similar vein, namely, that the principles of
the
Treaty of Waitangi have been and could be breached by the process of allocation adopted by
the
Commission (see <I>Maori LR</I> Feb 1995 p2).]<P>

<H3>Paul v Whakatane District Council & Another  </H3>
<I> A12/95, 13 March 1995. Sheppard J, PA Catchpole, F Easdale </I><P>
This was an appeal against a land-use consent granted by a local council for a bowling green.
The
appellant lived beside the affected land and complained there had been inadequate consultation
with
Maori because there had been no report on the relationship to the land of the particular hapu
the
appellant belonged to. This was despite the fact that the appellant was a member of the Ngati
Awa
Trust Board, and an environmental committee of that board had approved the proposal. The
appellant
claimed the environmental committee had given approval without going through the board as
was
required.<P>
Held: the bowling club had consulted with the board. The fact that the environmental
committee might
have failed to report back to the board before stating it had no concerns about the proposal
was an
internal matter between the board and the committee. There was nothing to indicate that the
local
council should have had any reason to doubt the competence of the committee to comment on
Maori
concerns. In addition, the appellant had direct notice of the proposal and the opportunity to
appear
at the initial hearing of the application for the resource consent. <P>
[ed: a trust board may not always be the appropriate body to consult, particularly where it
provides
representation for some limited purposes for otherwise strongly independent tribes or hapu.
The
Taranaki Maori Trust Board might be an example. Where relations between trust boards,
runanga,
iwi and hapu are undergoing change, the onus seems to be on local Maori to bring those
changes and
their implications for the consultation process clearly to the attention of consent authorities at
an early
stage in the consent process.]<P>

<H3>Treaty settlements and "offers back" under the Public Works Act  </H3>
<I>Replies Supplement 11 July 1995 p45  </I><P>
Hon DAM Graham: The Deed of Settlement between Waikato-Tainui and the Crown provides
....
that property allocated to be part of the settlement shall transfer subject to the provisions of
section
40 of the Public Works Act 1981. Under the Public Works Act it is only if surplus land is not
needed
for another public work or for a land exchange under subsection 40(1), and if the
Commissioner of
Crown Lands considers subsection 40(2) is satisfied, that an  offer back  is made to the former
owners or their successors. <P>
However, the Waikato-Tainui Deed of Settlement provides that the transfer of land from
ECNZ, and
other State owned enterprises, to Waikato-Tainui pursuant to the recent Treaty claims
settlement, will
be treated, on passage of the enacting legislation, as if it were a transfer pursuant to a binding
recommendation of the Waitangi Tribunal under section 8A(5) of the Treaty of Waitangi Act
1975.
Therefore no offers back to former owners of State owned enterprise land are envisaged.<P>
[ed: this may not be a straightforward issue, particularly as some persons who may have
otherwise
been entitled to a right of offer back may be Maori. However, it has been a matter of policy
since
1988 (when the Treaty of Waitangi (State Enterprises) Act inserted s8A(5)/1975), that where
the
Waitangi Tribunal makes a recommendation that state-owned enterprise land be returned to
Maori
ownership, Public Works Act offer back provisions cease to apply.]<P>

<H3>  Funding for the Settlement Envelope</H3>
<I> NZ Parliamentary debates 8 June 1995 p7194 </I><P>
Hon Winston Peters: How does the Prime Minister reconcile his statement about moving
towards
development [for Maori] when, since 1992, the Government has slashed funding for the
Department
of Maori Affairs by up to $200 million per annum, and now seeks to give back $1 billion over
10
years - which the Maori people can work out is the part they would have had, had they gone
with the
Department of Maori Affairs funding in the first place?<P>
Rt Hon JB Bolger: It was when that member was the Minister of Maori Affairs that the
structure of 
the old department of Maori Affairs, the Iwi Transition Authority, and all the rest, were
amalgamated
into Te Puni Kokiri. That is a smaller department, which is there primarily as an advisory body
to
ensure that other Government departments deliver services in a correct and proper
manner.<P>

<H3>  Reserved lands policy, compensation considerations</H3>
<I>  Replies Supplement 11 July 1995</I><P>
Hon John Luxton: As stated in the 1994 Government decisions booklet on Maori reserved
lands, the
issue of compensation to owners of reserved lands for past losses may be considered through
the
Treaty of Waitangi claims process. Accordingly, if any such compensation were to be made
through
this process, it would be charged against the settlement envelope. .... Compensation for claims
relating to Maori reserved land will be considered, along with all other claims, in the context
of the
settlement envelope. Therefore the level of compensation will depend on a consideration of
the
individual merits of the claims and the amount available in the settlement envelope for such
compensation.

This bill, much debated in recent weeks, provides simply that "Notwithstanding anything to

which
means the Hauraki Islands, the Coromandel Ecological Region and the Hauraki, Waihi and Te
Aroha
Ecological Districts under the Conservation Act 1987. Coastal marine areas adjoining these

<H3>Judicial Attitudes to Family Property  </H3>

In an address to a conference on family law, his Honour wondered whether the safeguards of
the
Matrimonial Property Act might not be fitted into the scheme and objectives of the Maori
Land Act.
He referred to <I>Grave v Grace</I> [1994] NZFLR 961, in which a wife sought a half share
in a
husband s interest in Maori freehold land, which included the land on which the family home
stood.
Because the Maori Land Act prevents the application of the Matrimonial Property Act to
Maori freehold
land, the wife had to seek a monetary contribution based on the law of trusts. His Honour
thought that,
notwithstanding developments in the law of trusts, this was still likely to provide a less than
adequate
remedy than the presumptions of equality and liberal concepts of contributions under the
Matrimonial
Property Act.<P>

[ed: this appears to be the first taiapure-local fishery declared. Other proposals are either still

<H3>August 1995</H3>

<H2><HR>The Treaty and Municipal Law</H2>
On the 7 April 1995 the Australian High Court in <I>Minister for Immigration & Ethnic
Affairs v
Teoh</I> (1995) 128 ALR 353 held that a convicted heroin smuggler from Malaysia, who
was refused
residence in Australia because of his criminal convictions, had a legitimate expectation that the
immigration
authorities would consider UN instruments on the paramount rights of children, and initiate
inquiries into
the effect his deportation might have on his children born in Australia. The majority of the
court found that
international instruments which had been ratified, even if not yet incorporated into municipal
law, could
generate a legitimate expectation that officials would act in accordance with them. As Dr
Rodney Harrison
noted in a recent paper, this and similar, if less dramatic, NZ judgments, open the way for
international
human rights covenants to be invoked in the context of administrative decision making by the
executive
("Domestic enforcement of international human rights in Courts of law: Some recent
developments"
<I>NZLJ</I> August 1995 p256). 
In light of these developments it is becoming alarmingly anachronistic that the Treaty of
Waitangi
remains officially in the position the Privy Council left it in in <I>Te HeuHeu Tukino v Aotea
District
Maori Land Board</I> [1941] AC 308, outside the municipal law of this country until
incorporated into
it directly by statute. In a recently published essay, Sian Elias QC has argued that "it is time to
recognise that the notion of arbitrary Parliamentary sovereignty represents an obsolete and
inadequate
idea of the New Zealand constitution. It fails to take account not only of the place of the
Treaty in
New Zealand history but also of developing principles of international law. The Treaty
requires to
be recognised as fundamental to our constitutional system by reason of its status as a compact
with
the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and because of the vulnerability of the indigenous
people and
the increasing international concerns for their protection." ("The Treaty of Waitangi and the
Separation
of Powers in NZ" in <I>Courts and Policy. Checking the Balance</I> Legal Research
Foundation
1995). 
At the hui called by Sir Hepi Te Heuheu in response to the Crown proposals for Treaty
settlements
it was decided that priority should be given to "a constitutional review jointly undertaken by
Maori
and the Crown for the purpose of developing a NZ constitution based on the Treaty of
Waitangi."
(MH Durie "Proceedings of a Hui held at Huirangi Marae, Turangi" in VUWLR vol 25 no 2
July
1995). In the coming months, it is hard to see how debate about the status of the Treaty can
be
avoided.<P>

<H3>New Appointment to the Waitangi Tribunal  </H3>
<I>Te Tari Kooti (Department for Courts) Press Statement 18 August 1995  </I><P>
Roger Maaka has been appointed to replace Sir Hugh Kawharu who recently retired. Mr
Maaka is
a lecturer in Maori Studies from the University of Canterbury and is currently completing a
short
period of teaching at the School of Native Studies at the University of Alberta, Canada. He is
of

<H3>  Memorandum of Crown Counsel Concerning Raupatu and Proposed Interim
Report</H3>
<I>  Wai 46 & other Bay of Plenty claims 28 July 1995</I><P>
At the request of the Tribunal for a statement of the Crown position, and after receiving
instructions
from the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, "The Crown acknowledges
that the
confiscation of land, as it occurred in the Eastern Bay of Plenty region, constituted an injustice
and
was therefore in breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Crown is amenable to
developing the precise wording of any statement on raupatu to be included in any Deed of
Settlement
in discussion with each claimant group, as a component of the negotiating process."<P>

<H3>  Amended Statement of Claim for Ngai Tahu</H3>
<I>Wai 27. 6 July 1995  </I><P>
The claimants allege that the Crown in August 1994 unilaterally suspended negotiations to
settle their
claim in light of the Waitangi Tribunal report of February 1991 against the wishes and without
the
consent of Ngai Tahu. This action, together with the release of the Treaty claim settlement
proposals
in December 1994, are said to have effectively denied Ngai Tahu of the opportunity for a
negotiated
settlement. The claimants say that the Crown has acted in bad faith during the course of
negotiations
and in suspending them. The Crown has sought to impose terms on the reopening of
negotiations
which would deny Ngai Tahu recourse to legal redress in the Tribunal or elsewhere. The
Crown
settlement proposals including its fiscal envelope represent "unconscionable and gross
breaches of
the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi." Accordingly, the claimants seek that the Tribunal
urgently
reconvene and make recommendations for the return of all state owned enterprises and Crown
forest
land within the Ngai Tahu takiwa (district). <P>
[ed: the tribunal has not yet issued substantive directions in response to this amended claim. A
hearing
is unlikely while various High Court actions brought by Ngai Tahu are pending, including an
action
concerned with an earlier tribunal ruling on urgency.]<P>

Several groups involved in litigation over the allocation of assets under the Sealords fisheries
settlement
of 1992 sought declarations or orders to prevent the Waitangi Tribunal from hearing claims
that the Treaty
of Waitangi Fisheries Commission (Te Ohu Kaimoana) had or might breach the principles of
the Treaty
of Waitangi in its current proceedings to determine the best allocation of the assets. The
tribunal had itself
heard argument and already issued an opinion that it could proceed to a hearing on the claims
(see
<I>Maori LR</I> May 1995).<P>
Held: the tribunal should not proceed with its proposed enquiry because it would be premature
as a
matter of law to do so. The Deed of Settlement of September 1992 provided that, in addition
to the
10% of national fishing quota already held by Maori under the Maori Fisheries Act 1989, the
Crown
would give $150 million to Maori to complete the purchase of a holding in Sealords fishing
company
whereby Maori would receive 26% of the national fishing quota. The Treaty of Waitangi
Fisheries
Commission was then to propose a scheme of distribution for pre-settlement assets (the 10%
of quota)
and a separate scheme for post settlement assets (the 26%). The Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries
Settlement) Act 1992 gave effect to the Deed. The current contentions concerned the scheme
of
distribution for pre-settlement assets and arguments surrounding the definition of iwi and the
model
of distribution to be used. The court noted the "prophetic" words of Cooke P when the Deed
of
Settlement was challenged in the Court of Appeal that "should any legislation be enacted in
this field,
there could be little point in bringing the matter again before the Courts until at least some
years of
experience have been gained, and perhaps not even then." <I>Te Runanga o Wharekauri
Rekohu Inc v
AG</I> [1993] 2 NZLR 301, 308.
Noted that the commission considered itself bound to distribute the pre-settlement assets to
iwi. Urban
Maori claimants contended "iwi" should include more recent groupings. The commission was
unfortunately stuck with the term "iwi" rather than the wider words of the Treaty referring to
"chiefs,
subtribes, and all the people of NZ" (article 2). This issue was before Anderson J in other High
Court
proceedings (see <I>Maori LR</I> July 1995). It was to be hoped the separate scheme for
post-
settlement assets would follow the pre-settlement principles. <P>
The distribution model based on coastline length but also partly on population (mana whenua
mana
moana model) is causing contention. It would be a national disaster if this dispute is not settled
by
agreement. This judgment was about the timing in the use of people and resources for
reaching that
agreement.<P>
The judgment should be read together with the <I>Fisheries Settlement Report 1992</I> of
the
Waitangi Tribunal. The precepts of that report were followed in this judgment. Shortcomings
noted in that
report of the Deed of Settlement had been perpetuated in the 1992 Act. The provisions of the
1992
were to be interpreted in light of the principles of the Treaty and the resolve by Crown and
Maori
to settle fishing claims once and for all in a spirit of co-operation and good faith. The tribunal
was
correct in its opinion that the fisheries commission acted in some of its functions on behalf of
the
Crown, and in proposing a policy for the allocation of settlement assets was acting on behalf
of both the
Crown and Maori. While the tribunal was precluded by s6(7) Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975
(inserted
by the 1992 Act) from challenging the settlement in respect of commercial fishing or fisheries
achieved by the Deed of Settlement and the 1992 Act, it had been correct in its finding that it
could
look at the mechanism establishing what the Deed and Act meant and how they were to work.
Nor
did s9 of the 1992 Act (no court or tribunal to have jurisdiction to hear claims concerning
commercial
fishing or the Deed) preclude a tribunal inquiry.<P>
When the commission reports to the minister a proposal for the allocation of pre or post
settlement
assets, there would only then be a policy proposed to be adopted both by the commission itself
and
by the Crown. The tribunal might then entertain claims in respect of the policy. However,
despite
submissions to the contrary, the commission had not yet made up its mind on a proposal for
allocating
pre-settlement assets. Detailed and "comprehensive" submissions from counsel for the
commission,
that no proposal had been decided upon and that work on a wide range of options was
continuing,
were accepted. The commission had not yet proposed a policy that could be the subject of
enquiry
by the tribunal. The commission had perhaps reached a low point in its search for agreement,
but it
was not at an impasse and had a working majority ready to press on. It would be unreal to
expect
commissioners not to be by now following or inclining towards a particular model.<P>
An argument by Sir Graham Latimer and others that commissioners, including himself, felt
overborne
by the others was refuted by Sir Graham s actions, namely his public, unfounded and  sad 
allegations that
some commissioners had acted fraudulently. <P>
The claims of various groups, including urban Maori, went to the heart of Maori unity and the
future
of iwi. Even the Treaty itself might be at stake. Accordingly, the court commended parties to
accept
a tribunal offer to stage a hui to seek a path to agreement in a forum traditional yet modern.
This was
an opportunity for statesmanship. <P>
[ed: the decision is noteworthy also for including a page long Maori text recording its essential
finding that, "e ai ki te ture, he wawe rawa te whai a Te Taraipiunara kia tirohia ngaa
whakahaere
a Te Ohu Kai Moana." The court accepted the approach of the commission - that there were
no serious
objections to the view that some mix of coastline length and population would be the basis of
any final
proposal, and that discussions were ongoing about what that mix might be. Even models for
allocation said
to be in disagreement with the commission approach, such as the Tainui "Takutaimoana"
model, included
some mix of coastline and population.]<P>

<I> HC 66/94, HC Auckland, 2 June 1995. Tompkins J </I><P>
This was an appeal against a decision declining an application for a Samoan child to be
adopted by
its grandparents (under restrictions in s11 Adoption Act 1955). The child had been born to a
young
unmarried mother who now lived with the grandparents and had since married a man other
than the
biological father. While an earlier decision <I>MR v Department of Social Welfare</I> (1986)
4
NZFLR 326 suggested that adoption by grandparents will not necessarily promote the
interests of the child
where a clear relationship with the mother still exists, decisions since then, most notably
<I>Re Adoption 
of A</I> [1992] NZFLR 422 and <I>Application for Adoption by RRM and RBM</I> [1994]
NZFLR
231, dealing with Maori children, showed that full regard should be had to the cultural
attitudes of the
family concerned. An adoption which might be considered inappropriate in a European setting
may
well promote the welfare and interests of the child in a Polynesian family.<P>

<H3>  Pineaha v Pepeko</H3>
<I>  CS 081 073 92. Family Court Waipukurau, 8 June 1995. Inglis J</I><P>
The mother of a male child born in 1984, who had had that child adopted at birth by a paternal
aunt,
applied for suspension of child support liability. The mother had never played any part in the
care
and upbringing of the child and the adoption, which had never been formalised under the
Adoption
Act 1955, was in accordance with tikanga Maori or recognised Maori custom. When the
adoptive aunt
and her partner had applied for and been granted a domestic purposes benefit the Department
of
Social Welfare had approached the birth mother seeking a liable parent contribution, arguing
that it
had no discretion to do otherwise under the legislation.<P>
Held: this was, by any reasonable standards, a situation which 'defied common sense'. The
customary
adoption had existed for nearly 11 years. Counsel for the mother argued that s25(1)(a)(ii)
Child Support
Act 1993 (parent ceases to be liable when child is "adopted"), when it refers to adoption, is
not limited to
adoptions under the Adoption Act 1955. Because Maori customary adoptions are clearly
referred to in
other legislation eg Maori Land Act 1993 (ss108 & 115), Parliament can hardly have been
ignorant of
them 2 years ago when it passed the Child Support Act.<P>
It is a necessity to acknowledge the cultural strength of adoptions according to tikanga Maori.
The
omission of a direct reference to the 1955 Act in s25 "could only have been deliberate and was
intended to enable customary Maori adoptions to be respected and recognised." Accordingly,
the
applicant ceased to be liable for child support when the child was adopted in accordance with
custom.
It would be sensible however for Maori who prefer custom and wish to remove any argument,
to
arrange a 're-adoption' under the 1955 Act.<P>

<H3>  Falkner & Ors v Gisborne District Council & Anor</H3>
<I>AP 1/95, HC Gisborne, 26 July 1995. Barker J  </I><P>
A group of homeowners, concerned that the local authority would no longer under the district
plan
protect their beachfront properties from erosion, argued that, despite the Resource
Management Act
1991, a common law rule continued in existence requiring the Crown to preserve the realm
from
inroads of the sea, and allowing the homeowners to take action to protect their properties
from the
sea. The High Court determined that, despite savings provisions in the RMA (s23), where
pre-existing
common law rights were inconsistent with the scheme of the Act, those rights would no longer
be
applicable. The Act was not a vindication of personal property rights but concerned the
sustainable
management of resources, therefore there was nothing in the scheme of the Act to suggest that
common law rights could not be infringed quite the reverse. The court suggested a
compensatory
scheme be enacted for the loss to be suffered by the homeowners by the change in the district
plan.<P>
[ed: this decision is noted because if indicates the potential impact of the RMA and similar
legislation on
rights which might be claimed under the doctrine of aboriginal title to the ownership,
management and use
of resources.]<P>

<H3>  Mataka Station Ltd v Far North District Council & Anor</H3>
<I> A69/95, Planning Tribunal, 20 July 1995. Bollard J, Dr AH Hackett Mr IG McIntyre
</I><P>
An appeal against conditions of a resource consent granted by the council for a papakainga
housing
scheme in the Bay of Islands. The scheme was for 25 dwellings on a 172.77 hectare coastal
block of
Maori freehold land managed as a s438 trust (now an ahu whenua trust see s354 & s215 Te
Ture
Whenua Maori 1993). The land was ancestral land which had been in the ownership of the
applicants'
families since pre-European times and was held in multiple ownership by descendants of the
original
tupuna (ancestor). There was a marae and urupa on the block. The appellant's main concern
was that
the location of some dwellings on an area facing the sea would detract from the visual quality
of the
coastal environment, contrary to statements in various national, regional and district plans and
the
RMA itself. It was argued that some dwellings should be located in a central valley away from
the
coast. <P>
Held: it was agreed by all parties that the block was suitable for a papakainga development.
The
district plan provided that marae and urupa were a permitted activity, and papakainga housing
a
discretionary activity within the coastal zone 1A designation covering the land. The district
plan
provided for 11 coastal zones. Zone 1A applied to sensitive parts of the coastal environment
where
conservation oriented polices were to be pursued and some managed change was allowed.
Papakainga
housing in the zone, when permitted, was to be limited to 25 houses per site with a density of
1 unit
per 2 hectares of site area. No dwelling in the zone could be closer than 40 metres from the
mean
high water mark. Earthworks undertaken in the zone for dwellings were also subject to limits.
A
papakainga development plan was to be forwarded to the council prior to the commencement
of any
work.<P>
The provisions of other relevant planning instruments were examined, namely, the proposed
Regional
Policy Statement, the NZ Coastal Policy Statement and the proposed Regional Coastal Plan,
which
designated the area as a "Marine 2 (Conservation) Management Area". The tribunal noted a
legal
opinion that, because different owners would have stronger ancestral links with some parts of
the
block than with others, it was appropriate that the location of housing sites on the block
should
promote whanaungatanga links of owners with their own particular piece of land or
turangawaewae.<P>
After evaluating these documents and the RMA (Part II and s104(1) in particular), the tribunal
made
an interim ruling allowing the scheme to proceed, bearing in the mind the need to ensure that
the
character of the coastal environment was maintained while allowing the applicants to locate on
those
dwelling sites as near as possible to areas with which they retained special links based on
ancestral
connections. Tentative conditions to be imposed included:<P>
 that a surveyor locate each proposed dwelling site more exactly than on current plans;<P>
 that dwellings be of single or split level construction only;<P>
 electric power and telecommunications services be visually non-intrusive and underground
as far
  as possible;<P>
 that water storage and other accessory buildings for each dwelling be restricted in area;<P>
 that all buildings be painted in  naturally recessive colours  to blend with the landscape;<P>
 application be made to the Maori Land Court to define accessways across the block, and to
set
  aside a foreshore area as a Maori reservation for esplanade-scenic purposes;<P>
 conditions as to the quality and width of roadways over the block;<P>
 that before building consents issued, a landscape plan be submitted to the council, and
occupiers
  enter an agreement with the council to maintain the landscape in accordance with the plan,
including
  an undertaking not to fell trees or scrub to increase views from the dwelling, and to
implement the
  landscaping works applying to the dwelling within 12 months of occupying the dwelling;<P>
 the trustees have overall responsibility to implement the landscape plan within an agreed
period;<P>
 an arrangement be made for fencing to be erected to restrict stock movement on the
block;<P>
 a time period be set within which existing unauthorised structures, including derelict
vehicles, be
  removed from the block.<P>
Parties were to reapply for final orders when the survey work to better locate the proposed
dwellings
and preparation of landscape plans had been completed.<P>
[ed: the case is a good example of the many planning rules papakainga schemes may be subject
to
under the RMA regime, and the numerous conditions which may be imposed before schemes
proceed.]<P>

<H2><HR>General  </H2>
<H3> Waikato-Tainui Raupatu Claims Settlement Bill 1995 </H3>
<I>No 104-1  </I><P>
When enacted, this bill would make the necessary legislative changes to put into effect the
Deed of
Settlement of 22 May 1995 between Waikato-Tainui and the Crown (see <I>Maori LR</I>
May 1995).
The Deed of Settlement contained undertakings by the Crown to transfer particular Crown
owned
properties in the Waikato-Tainui claim area to a land holding trust established by the
claimants. Much of
this Bill is concerned with the undertaking that, wherever possible, land should be the
recompense for the
land that was confiscated. It does this by providing that all residual Crown lands in the claim
area be
potentially available for transfer to the land holding trust. Accordingly, the Bill provides
mechanisms
for:<P>
 the transfer of Crown lands to the land holding trust;<P>
 having titles to all residual Crown properties in the claim area marked with memorials
noting that
  the land may be required to be offered for purchase to the land holding trust in certain
  circumstances;<P>
 requiring Crown bodies to give the land holding trust the first right of refusal over any
residual
  Crown land which they seek to sell;<P>
 providing for the Crown to compulsorily acquire residual Crown land from Crown bodies to
  further the settlement;<P>
 providing for properties to be vested in Pootatau Te Wherowhero (Te Rapa and Hopuhopu
land
  being the first) as directed by the land holding trust.<P>
Because the settlement seeks to finally settle Tainui claims in the claim area, the Bill also
contains
provisions:<P>
 to cancel resumptive memorials from all state owned enterprise properties in the claim
area;<P>
 to remove any requirements under the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989 that Crown forest
lands in
  the claim area be considered for return to Maori, except for Maramarua and Onewhero
forests,
  which are to be returned to the claimants (the return of Onewhero is subject however to a
suitable
  arrangement with the counter-claiming Hauraki Maori Trust Board being worked out first
);<P>
 removing the jurisdiction of the Waitangi Tribunal under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975
to
  consider further the Waikato-Tainui claims finalised by the Deed of Settlement, or consider
the
  settlement or benefits under it.<P>
The Bill also makes incidental amendments to: <P>
 Transit NZ Act 1989 - providing that projects affecting land registered in the name of
Pootatau Te
Wherowhero may not proceed unless the land holding trustee has first been consulted;<P>
 Conservation Act 1987 - providing for the appointment of the Maori Queen and her
successors to
  the conservation board covering the claim area;<P>
 Resource Management Act 1991 - providing that resource consents may not be granted
conditional
  on a financial contribution comprising or including land registered in the name of Pootatau
Te
  Wherowhero;<P>
 Crown Minerals Act 1991 - requiring the consent of the land holding trustee before any
exploration
  activities can be carried out on land registered in the name of Pootatau Te Wherowhero, or
land
  regarded as waahi tapu by the trustee;<P>
 Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 - providing for the eventual dissolution of the Tainui Maori
Trust
  Board when the settlement is in place, and cancellation of the annuity to that Board.<P>

<H3>  Trial by Peers? The Composition of New Zealand Juries</H3>
<I>  July 1995. Policy and Research Division. Department of Justice</I><P>
This is an interesting study of apparent racial bias at work in NZ courts. Historically, Maori
were
excluded from sitting on juries until 1962 (except in Maori-Maori matters). Moana Jackson's
paper
<I>The Maori and the Criminal Justice System: A New Perspective - He Whaipaanga
Hou</I> (1988)
alleged that a monocultural bias existed in jury composition because of the way jury lists were
assembled
from the electoral rolls and the way challenges were made in court. This report investigated
those
allegations.<P>
With regard to compilation of the jury list, the report found that in comparison with the
population
as a whole Maori were under-represented because of the relative youthfulness of the Maori
population
(ie fewer eligible to serve), the smaller proportion of Maori living near urban areas where jury
trials
are held (jury lists draw on people within 30 km of the courthouse) and the higher rate of
Maori non-
registration on electoral rolls. Other factors thought to be involved were jury summonses
being sent
by post to a highly mobile population, and disqualification through previous convictions
(higher rates
of Maori conviction). Maori women were also under represented in the jury pool. Research
showed
that there would be little change by increasing the size of districts from which juries are drawn
to take
account of the rural dwelling bias in the Maori population.<P>
A survey of challenges in court showed that although defence counsel were twice as likely to
challenge
jurors as the prosecution, prosecution counsel were twice as likely to challenge Maori as
non-Maori in
the High Court, and 3 times as likely in the District Court, meaning that close to every second
Maori male
was challenged in the District Court. Maori males were overall the most challenged group. To
explore this
bias, a qualitative survey of judges, lawyers and court staff was undertaken. Evidence of
previous
convictions (police regularly provide printouts from the Wanganui computer to counsel), and
the
impression that Maori males would be more lenient on the accused, particularly where the
accused is
Maori, emerged as important factors. This bore out suggestions from US research that black
jurors are
less likely to convict than white ones and that the prosecution are more likely to challenge a
person of the
same minority group as the defendant. Other factors included perceptions of whanau or
kinship links with
the accused, demeanour, socio-economic bias, and client instructions. A counter-bias was also
noted,
where counsel did not want to give the rest of the jury the impression that they were selecting
solely by
race.<P>
Despite these problems, there was little support from judges, lawyers and court staff either to
reduce
the number of challenges, or to provide guidelines for prosecution challenges. The authors
recommend
that consideration be given to the current number and use of challenges and whether they lead
to a properly
representative jury, a trial by one's peers.<P>
[ed: It is interesting to see that the same problems which plagued the carrying out of the Maori
electoral option, the low number on the electoral roll and the inefficiency of postal
communication,
also have an impact on the involvement of Maori in the justice system.]<P>

<H3>  Treaty Issues: The Unfinished Business. Proceedings of a conference held in
Wellington,
February 1995</H3>
<I>VUWLR vol 25 no 2 July 1995  </I><P>
This volume of the Victoria University Law Review is dedicated to Treaty issues. Highlights
include: 
MH Durie "Proceedings of a Hui held at Huirangi Marae, Turangi" (p109) concerns the hui
called
by Sir Hepi Te Heuheu to discuss the government Treaty settlement proposals released in
December
1994. The paper notes the need to develop a constitutional framework in which the Treaty
achieved
certainty.<P>
Sir Kenneth Keith "The Roles of the Tribunal, the Courts and the Legislature" (p129)
reviewed
recent applications of the Treaty in NZ law. Reflecting on the place of the Treaty in the NZ
constitution
in the future he said we should be wary of terms like sovereign and independent, "In the
present world,
made even smaller by technology and many other human and natural forces, no state is fully
sovereign in
its external relations, and leaving aside a handful of absolute dictatorships no politician or
government or
parliament has real internal sovereignty. What we are seeing is the dispersal of power from
so-called
'sovereign states' in at least three directions - to the international community, to the private
sector, and
to public bodies and communities within the State." He suggested the possibilities for
enforcing Maori
aspirations included; a measure of self determination, the power of veto, rights placed as a
constraint on
or made relevant to the exercise of public power, Maori rights to be recognised as equal under
Article 3.
"The variety of those actual and possible arrangements indicates that the oft stated proposition
that the law
must apply equally to all at all times is too simple. We need to have a more subtle, but still
principled,
approach to the recognition and allocation of power. ...The diversity can relate to the deciders
and their
processes as well as to the substantive rules and principles."<P>
Robert Te Kotahi Mahuta "Tainui: A Case Study of Direct Negotiation" (p157) discussed the
history
of negotiations with Tainui and the recent settlement negotiations. <P>
Sir Tipene O Regan "A Ngai Tahu Perspective on Some Treaty Questions" (p178) contains
characteristically pithy comments on current Treaty issues, including the view that iwi are the
appropriate body to settle matters with in preference to hapu or pan Maori organisations. "[A]
hapu,
like the subsets of which it is composed, the 'whanau', is really an extremely dynamic concept.
It
is in a process of continual evolution and decay. ... If I want to disassociate myself from my
immediate
relations in some manner, all I have to do is go to the [cemetery] headstone, pluck down a
name, establish
the whakapapa to that name, and announce myself as 'Ngati Mea' or 'Ngati Mea Iti' for the
occasion.
Then I trot along to the Maori Land Court and make a section 30 application and before long
the Maori
radio is dripping with my tearful struggle to assert my identity. ... In practice as well as in
tikanga and
legal terms, there exists a tribal overright. ... the Iwi, the tribe, is a group around which you
can
effectively erect a whakapapa fence which matches the rohe fence."<P>
Tania Rangiheuea "The Role of Maori Women in Treaty Negotiations and Settlements"
(p195)
concludes that to date, women have been on the outside looking in, with decisions being made
by a
Maori "boys club".<P>
Whaimutu Dewes "Fisheries - A Case Study of an Outcome" (p219) comments on progress
with
allocation by the Fisheries Commission. He notes that customary fisheries issues are a mess
and are
underresourced.<P>
Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Palmer "Where to From Here?" (p241) said that "the idea that
sovereignty
should be given to Maori at a time when the notions of sovereignty are collapsing all over the
world
seems to me to be ludicrous. Once upon a time we thought the NZ Government was
sovereign. We
hardly think that now. Far from being the indivisible omnipresent concept that Hobbes made it
in
<I>Leviathan</I>, sovereignty is more like a piece of chewing gum. It can be stretched and
pulled
in many directions to do almost anything. Sovereignty is not a word that is useful and ought to
be banished
from political debate. The notion that sovereignty for Maori comes from the Treaty of
Waitangi is
highly controversial and requires reading one provision of the Treaty up and another
down."<P>
In a final "Comment" Moana Jackson (p245) said that he knows of no "fiercely independent
group
of people in the world .. who would voluntarily give away their sovereign authority" and the
"untruth"
that the Treaty achieved such a thing should be dropped. He is concerned that the Treaty is
losing its
political reality and being drowned in the rhetoric of the law, and quoted a Canadian
indigenous lawyer
reflecting on the concerns of the majority culture: "... I say to indigenous people, tell your
stories of
difference to break away from where they wish us to be. Because where they wish us to be is
somewhere
between being dominated and apparently equal, somewhere between laughter and tears."

<H2><HR>Time for a review?</H2>
In February 1995, the Ngai Tahu claimants, frustrated with the lack of progress in negotiations
with
the Crown over settlement of their land claims, asked the Waitangi Tribunal for an early
fixture in
the hope that the tribunal would make binding recommendations to government for the return
of
Crown forest lands to Ngai Tahu. The chairperson of the tribunal turned down this and a
subsequent
request concerning state owned enterprise lands, on the basis that the tribunal had limited
resources,
and Ngai Tahu hearings had already consumed a fair proportion of them. <P>
In response, the Ngai Tahu claimants have filed a High Court action attacking the chairperson
s
ruling, criticising his decisions on the allocation of Tribunal resources and the move away from
hearing claims in sequence. They seek a declaration that no further fixtures be made by the
tribunal
until the High Court proceedings are resolved.<P>
This episode highlights the intolerable position the Waitangi Tribunal has found itself in for
lack of
a full public review of its process since 1975. Regular public reviews are a statutory
requirement for
land claim tribunals in Australia, and help to increase the efficiency and fairness of the work of
those
tribunals and maintain public faith in them.  <P>
The approach to review in New Zealand is piecemeal. As the government seeks public
submissions
on the Treaty settlement package, which includes some proposed amendments to legislation
governing
the tribunal, it is considering an internal discussion paper on changes to the tribunal and is
adjusting
various other matters in the settlement process through a series of Cabinet papers (<I>nga
korero o te
wa</I> September 1995). These efforts may be worthwhile, but it is difficult, given this
piecemeal
approach, for the public or Maori to be confident that that is the case.<P>
In an independent report the Auditor-General has highlighted this problem (reviewed under
"General"
below). He notes that, until his report, there has been no comprehensive account of how
Treaty
claims are settled, which agencies are involved and for what purposes, what costs are incurred,
and
what results have been achieved. He concludes that "only a limited number of people within
government,
or outside of it, have a good understanding of these matters". He makes a number of
recommendations
which would allow progress in hearing and settling claims to be independently and publicly
measured. This
is surely the best way of maintaining public and Maori faith with the process.<P>

<H2><HR> Maori Land Court and Appellate Court </H2>
<H3>  In Re Rotoma No 1 Incorporation</H3>
<I>  241 Rotorua MB 223, 4 September 1995, Savage J</I><P>
An incorporation passed a special resolution providing that the committee of management in
its
discretion enter into several leases in excess of 21 years on terms and conditions set by the
committee.
A copy was filed with the court as required by Reg 4(4) Maori Incorporations Constitution
Regulations
1994. The court questioned whether the special resolution complied with s254(1)/1993 which
provides that
a Maori incorporation may only grant a lease over Maori freehold land vested in it for a term
of more than
21 years "pursuant to a special resolution authorising ... the grant of the lease."<P>
Held: the resolution had in effect delegated the power of approval of each lease to the
committee of
management. Under the 1993 Act, Maori incorporations no longer absolutely own the land
upon
which they operate, and are now trustees of it for the beneficial owners who have a direct
interest in
it as Maori freehold land. Section 254, new to the 1993 Act, reflects this change, by limiting
the
powers of alienation of the committee of management and ensuring owners are fully informed
of
decisions in relation to the land. This is also in accord with the Long Title of the Act and
interpretation
provisions of s2(2)/1993. <P>
The argument that the words "the lease" in s254(1) do not refer to a particular lease was
rejected.
Such an interpretation would potentially enable a committee of management by a single special
resolution to enter a whole series of leasing transactions over hundreds of years until revoked
by
another special resolution. An orthodox approach to statutory interpretation meant that  the
lease 
referred to the lease in contemplation at the time a special resolution was passed (<I>R v
Gallagher</I> [1993] 1 NZLR 659 followed where the words "the trial" were
considered).<P>
Sensible use of the powers under the Maori Incorporations Constitution Regulations 1994 can
make
leasing procedures flexible. Matters such as the notice to be given before leasing need not be
expensive
and can be fixed by a special resolution under Reg 3(3). This was not the occasion for the
court to dictate
the exact form of notice, but the court would expect notice to refer to the general form of
lease and the
proposed resolution as being available for inspection at the office of the incorporation. It
would be
expected that the notice would inform owners of the proposed tenant's name, term of lease,
rental to be
paid and review provisions. What was important was that shareholders be given a proper
opportunity to
make a decision and take part in decision making if they so wished. Accordingly, an order was
made under
s280(6)(e) for the incorporation to lease in accordance with the judgment.<P>
[ed: the court noted that s254 had been considered in <I>Re Proprietors of Mangakino
Township
Inc</I> 66 Taupo MB 235, 3 March 1995 but that decision was not relevant to this case.]<P>

<H2><HR> Waitangi Tribunal </H2>
<H3>  Surplus lands within the Turanganui A Kiwa region</H3>
<I>  Wai 518, 15 September 1995. Deputy CJ Smith</I><P>
SJ Pardoe and Te Runanga o Turanganui a Kiwa sought an urgent hearing of their claim
which
alleges that certain protective mechanisms which the Crown has established to check with
Maori if they
have claims over surplus Crown lands before they are disposed of by sale, are inadequate to
protect Maori
interests in terms of the Treaty. The claim concerned lands now surplus to the Crown in
Gisborne City
and the wider Gisborne area which might be capable of return to the claimants should their
Treaty claims
be proved valid. However a considerable number of claimants joined these proceedings to
expand the
matter to cover all Crown surplus lands.<P>
After a telephone judicial conference the tribunal granted urgency. Figures showed that very
little land
had been removed from sale despite many Maori applications, indicating that "the present
policy falls
markedly short of the protection sought and there is a genuine concern among the iwi, hapu
and
Maori generally that the continued sale of surplus Crown lands jeopardises their expectation of
settlement of their respective claims". It was noted that the Crown is presently undertaking a
review
of the surplus lands policy, but the urgent hearing should nevertheless proceed as sales are
continuing
under the existing policy. <P>
This allocation of a fixture was however conditional on the outcome of Ngai Tahu High Court
proceedings, which seek a declaration that the tribunal not allocate any further fixtures until
Ngai
Tahu concerns about the tribunal refusal to allocate a fixture to Ngai Tahu have been
heard.<P>
[ed: for a discussion of the Ngai Tahu proceedings see the editorial above.] <P>

<H3>Interim report on Turangi Lands Claim  </H3>
<I> Wai 84, 8 September 1995 </I><P>
In an interim report to the Minister of Maori Affairs, the Minister in Charge of Treaty
Negotiations,
and the Ministers for State-owned Enterprises and Lands, the tribunal recommended that, as a
report
for this claim is imminent, the Crown should withhold from sale all Crown property in Turangi
pending receipt of the report. In a further interim report on 15 September, the tribunal
recommended
that the Crown agree to meet the reasonable outstanding legal costs and disbursements of
claimant
counsel both for the hearing of the claim, and for any subsequent negotiations. This
recommendation
was made the tribunal said because its final report, "which has found that various of the
claimants'
grievances are well founded" was now with the printer, but made no mention of costs incurred
by
the claimants. <P>
In a memorandum also dated 15 September, the tribunal declined a claimant request that it
recommend
that a land bank be established by the Crown for the claim. In light of the 8 September interim
report and
pending final report (which should be available for presentation to the Minister on or soon
after 2 October
1995) such a recommendation was not felt to be appropriate.<P>

<H2><HR>  Other Jurisdictions</H2>
<H3>  Ngai Tahu Maori Trust Board & Ors v D-G of Conservation & Ors</H3>
<I> CA 18/95, 22 September 1995. Cooke P, Richardson, Casey, Hardie Boys, Gault JJ
</I><P>
The Director-General of Conservation in 1992 notified his intention to issue a further permit
for
commercial sperm whale-watching off the Kaikoura Coast. The holders of the only 2 existing
permits,
both of them companies owned by Ngai Tahu, objected on Treaty of Waitangi and legitimate
expectation 
grounds. An injunction was obtained. However in December 1994 the High Court dismissed
the Ngai
Tahu claim that, by virtue of the Treaty of Waitangi, they were entitled to a period of five
years
protection from competition, or were able to require that the D-G issue no new permits
without their
consent. Ngai Tahu appealed that decision.<P>
Held:  Regulations in 1990 and 1992 made under the Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978
(MMPA)
controlled the issue and nature of permits for whale-watching. The MMPA required that
before
issuing any permit the Minister of Conservation should have regard to the need to conserve
marine
mammals, any international agreements to which NZ is a party, and submissions received as a
result
of public notification of the intention to issue a permit. The width of these provisions would
enable
submissions based on the Treaty and the taking into account of Treaty considerations by the
Minister.
There was also nothing in the 1990 or 1992 regulations (conferring on the D-G the discretion
is issue
permits) to prevent the D-G likewise from taking into account Treaty considerations. <P>
Section 4 of the Conservation Act 1987 provides that that Act be interpreted and administered
so as
to give effect to the principles of the Treaty. Section 6 made it a function of the department to
administer the MMPA. There was accordingly sufficient direction to make it a requirement for
the
D-G to administer the MMPA so as to give effect to the principles of the Treaty.<P>
The Crown was correct in its view that references to the Treaty and Maori in other acts
administered
by the department under s6 would have an impact on the interpretation of s4 if there was an
apparent
difference between provisions. However in this case there were no arguably competing
references
between s4 and the MMPA. Statutory provisions giving effect to the principles of the Treaty
in
matters of interpretation and administration should not be narrowly construed. The MMPA
and
regulations were to be interpreted and administered to give effect to Treaty principles at least
to the
extent that that Act and regulations were not clearly inconsistent with those principles.<P>
Whichever version of article 1 of the Treaty is used, it provided power to the Queen in
Parliament
to enact comprehensive legislation for the protection of the environment and natural
resources. The
second article also clearly extended to such sea fisheries as the tribes possessed. Authority for
the
view that Maori had developed fisheries along the coasts before 1840, and that Maori have
customary,
aboriginal title or Treaty rights and that the Crown has fiduciary duties in relation to those
rights is
found in <I>Te Runanga o Muriwhenua Inc v A-G</I> [1990] 2 NZLR 641, 646-7 and <I>Te
Runanga o Wharekauri Rekohu v A-G</I> [1993] 2 NZLR 301, 303-6. Rights in both
commercial and
non-commercial fishing are dealt with by the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement
Act 1992,
which does not however affect whale-watching claims.<P>
Ngai Tahu had pitched their claim too high in arguing that the right to conduct commercial
whale-watching
tours came within the scope of the Treaty or aboriginal title, and accordingly no permit could
be granted
without their consent (even allowing that consent could not be unreasonably withheld).
Following the
findings of the <I>Ngai Tahu Sea Fisheries Report 1992</I> of the Waitangi Tribunal about
traditional
shore and sea whaling operations, the appellants had argued that while traditionally they had
no property
in the whales themselves, they had a right of control over access to resources in the sea, and
that the
present whale-watching operations were a modern-day expression of that right, or arose from
it as a right
of development. Putting aside the possibility that control may have been extinguished with the
extinguishment of title to adjoining coastal lands, it is obvious commercial whale-watching is
distinct from
anything envisaged by the Treaty.  Nor has there been any case in any jurisdiction in which an
exclusive
right to carry out whale-watching has been dealt with, and while international jurisprudence is
coming to
recognise an right of development within indigenous rights, that right is not necessarily
exclusive. The
argument of the Crown was preferred, relying on <I>Te Runanganui o Te Ika Whenua Inc v
A-G</I>
[1994] 2 NZLR 20, 24-5, that however liberally customary title and Treaty rights may be
construed,
tourism and whale-watching are remote from anything contemplated by the original parties to
the Treaty.
A Ngai Tahu veto right must therefore be rejected.<P>
However, the Crown had also pitched its argument too high in saying it had no more than a
duty to
consult with Ngai Tahu, and that Ngai Tahu representations could not materially affect the
decision
to issue a permit. Although commercial whale-watching is not a taonga, it is so linked to
taonga and
fisheries that a reasonable Treaty partner would recognise that Treaty principles are relevant,
and the
matter must be approached broadly. Since <I>NZ Maori Council v A-G</I> [1987] 1 NZLR
641 it
has been established that active protection of Maori interests is required and to restrict this to
consultation
would be hollow. While conservation values must be paramount, the D-G could legitimately
take into
account whether rival applicants were less disturbing of the whales, a secondary issue might be
the
standard of service provided to tourists. A residual factor of weight must be the Treaty duty to
recognise the special interests that Ngai Tahu have developed in these coastal waters. A
period of
protection from outside competition may be part of this. Accordingly, the decision would be
referred
back to the D-G with a declaration that, subject to the primary consideration of preservation
and
protection of the whales, the D-G should take into account as a relevant factor the protection
of Ngai
Tahu Treaty interests.<P>
There were special features in this case to be noted; viewing whales has some similarity with
fishing
or shore whaling, and although not a taonga or a subject of rangatiratanga, it is analogous.
Historically,
guiding visitors to see natural resources has been a natural role of Maori, the whale watching
operation
is essentially tribal, the companies involved being emanations of Ngai Tahu, and Ngai Tahu
had been
pioneers of the enterprise. As was recognised in <I>Te Runanga o Wharekauri Rekohu v
A-G</I>
(p304) the Treaty created an enduring relationship of a fiduciary nature akin to a partnership,
with each
party accepting a positive duty to act reasonably towards the other. A reasonable Treaty
partner would not
restrict consideration of Ngai Tahu interests to mere matters of procedure. The iwi were in a
different
position in substance from other applicants. Subject to overriding conservation considerations
and the
quality of service offered, Ngai Tahu were entitled to a reasonable degree of preference.
However, it was
noted that the particular combination of factors made this case unique and its precedent value
was therefore
likely to be 'very limited'.<P>

<H3> Huataki Holdings Ltd & Anor v Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries </H3>
<I> M39/94 & M40/94 HC Nelson 4 August 1995. Neazor J </I><P>
A fishing company holding quota under the Fisheries Act 1983, and representing a number of
iwi of
the northern South Island, was charged, along with its director, with selling fish to unlicensed
persons and
failing to complete and furnish catch returns. The charges related to the period before the
coming into
effect of the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992, when s88(2) Fisheries
Act 1983
relating to Maori fishing rights was still in effect.<P>
Before the district court the defendants argued that s88(2) provided a defence. The tribes had
traditionally
made no distinction between commercial and other fishing. The judge rejected that argument
on the
grounds that insufficient evidence of traditional fishing rights had been provided, and that the
iwi had
chosen to enter the quota system and therefore must accept the duties imposed by it.<P>
Held: in <I>Te Weehi</I> [1986] 1 NZLR 680 and <I>Te Runanga O Muriwhenua Inc</I>
[1990]
2 NZLR 641 the courts recognised that s88(2) preserved Maori tribal sea fishing rights,
although the
argument was never concluded before the Settlement Act 1992 brought that litigation to an
end.
Accordingly, before the passing of the 1992 Act, the appellants were bound by the quota
scheme unless
and to the extent they could show that they were exercising rights pursuant to s88(2). The
holding of quota
and a claim to a traditional fishing right were therefore not mutually exclusive.<P>
Section 11(4)/1992 now provided that as soon as a species was declared subject to the quota
management
system that declaration could not be questioned. Section 9(b)/1992 provided that no court had
jurisdiction
to enquire into the existence of rights in commercial fishing. The question whether that
prevented this
present case being considered was not argued, but it might be that s26(1) NZ Bill of Rights
Act would
allow s9(b) to be interpreted to allow a defence for events occurring before the 1992 Act was
enacted.
It was not argued whether a company, as a creature of statute, could claim to be exercising a
Maori
fishing right, but it might well be accepted that a wholly Maori owned company can be
accepted as
authorised to act for those in whom a right exists.<P>
The onus of proof was on the defendant to prove a Maori fishing right was being exercised,
and not
on the Crown to prove that the defendant s actions fell within the offence provisions of the
fisheries
legislation. The reasoning to the contrary in <I>MAF v Ransom</I> [1993] DCR 1127 was
not
followed and <I>Te Weehi</I> and <I>Green v MAF</I> [1990] 1 NZLR 411 cases, placing
the
onus on the defendant, were preferred. <P>
However, there was insufficient evidence on the balance of probabilities that a Maori fishing
right
was being exercised and the appeal in this regard was dismissed.<P>
[ed: the court noted that this decision is now of largely historical interest because of the 1992
legislation.
The decision does however confirm once again the strength of the doctrine of common law
aboriginal title
in New Zealand, including the point that aboriginal title rights to a resource are not
automatically
extinguished or reduced by the enactment of a detailed regulatory scheme for that
resource.]<P>

<H3> Ngati Wai Trust Board & Ors v Whangarei District Council & Anor </H3>
<I> A 80/95, 28 August 1995. Sheppard J, PA Catchpole, F Easdale </I><P>
Local Maori and a supporting group, Network Waitangi, appealed against a decision of the
district
council granting a resource consent for the "intensification" of a caravan park by provision of
a further
120 camping sites. The Planning Tribunal rejected the appeal. Among other matters, the
tribunal found
that: <P>
 Claims that tangata whenua had not been consulted were not made out. Although the RMA
1991
does not specifically require consultation with tangata whenua, it is recognised good practice
to do
so where issues under ss6(e) or 7(a)/1991 arise. Here there was a disagreement among local
Maori
about who actually had tangata whenua status. It was not for the consent authority to decide
which
among competing groups is entitled to the status of tangata whenua or mana whenua (see
<I>Paihia and
District Citizens Assoc v Northland Regional Council</I> A77/95), and the applicants had
taken
reasonable steps to consult with all who claimed that status. <P>
 The argument that the consent did not provide for the cultural well being of tangata whenua
and
  that only tangata whenua were competent to judge that, should be rejected. Expert evidence
  showed that the cultural well being of people in the area would be maintained, and in raising
the
  issue before the tribunal, the appellants must accept the tribunal s competence to rule in this
  matter, and provide evidence to support their contrary view.<P>
 As to s6(e) (preserving relationship of Maori with the area), the conditions imposed by the
council
  on the consent, in particular, that the camping ground proprietors inform campers of Maori
values
  and waahi tapu in the area, were adequate. Archaeological evidence did not support
assertions
  about the existence of other claimed burial areas, and the Department of Conservation could
  protect existing waahi tapu areas which might receive increased visits.<P>
 As to s7(a) (kaitiakitanga), consent authorities do not have to decide between competing
groups
  claiming kaitiaki status. Conditions on the consent were adequate to ensure kaitiaki values
would
  be maintained.<P>
 As to s8 (Treaty), the tribunal rejected the claim that granting the consent failed to account
for the
  essential nature of the Treaty bargain, including tribal self-regulation. Evidence of the
appellants
  on this point had been general and similar to 'political rhetoric' and not applied to the
particular
  case.<P>
The tribunal also commented that tangata whenua evidence which focuses succinctly on facts
and
attitudes relevant to the particular case is welcomed, and can be influential when timely notice
is
given in accordance with the Act, and statements of evidence are delivered to other parties
prior to
hearing.<P>

<H2><HR> General </H2>
<H3>  Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1995</H3>
Sections 3 to 6 of this Act give effect to the settlement of a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal
concerning lands at Hauai peninsula in Northland. In the early 1970s, the trustees of 25
hectares of
Maori freehold land on the peninsula made plans to subdivide it. In 1974, after approaches
from the
Department of Lands and Survey (concerned at the time to preserve coastal lands for 'all New
Zealanders'), the land was exchanged for 28 hectares of Crown land known as Felix Farm in
Whangarei,
represented to be 'suitable for subdivision'. The Felix Farm land had previously been affected
by coal
mining operations, and was potentially subject to subsidence something the new Maori owners
were not
aware of. In 1989 the Maori Land Court overturned the exchange on a procedural technicality
and
suggested negotiations to remedy the issue (1989 <I>Chief Judge MB</I> 67). Eventually a
claim was
made to the Waitangi Tribunal, which appointed a mediator to effect a settlement, which this
Act puts into
effect. <P>
The Act revests in the Hauai trustees the peninsula land and revests in the Crown the Felix
Farm
land. The present reservation status of the Hauai land under the Reserves Act 1977 is
cancelled.
Marginal strip requirements of s24 Conservation Act 1987 will not apply to the revested Hauai
land,
but an area equivalent to the marginal strip is to be held by the trustees as a Maori reservation
for
the common use and benefit of the people of NZ. A waahi tapu area is also separately
reserved. This
legislation was first introduced in 1993, but was not passed until 21 September 1995. <P>

<H3>  The Settlement of Claims under the Treaty of Waitangi. Report of the Controller and
Auditor-General</H3>
<I>  Second Report for 1995. 12 September 1995. DJD Macdonald</I><P>
The Auditor-General s interest in this area arises from the considerable sums of public money
involved. The report describes current policy and the legislative framework for the hearing and
settlement of claims and identifies the agencies and processes involved. Costs were difficult to
quantify because of changing reporting systems. The total money spent to date on processing
claims
from 1991-2 to 1995 (including research, tribunal hearings etc)  is $41,337m, with most (over
$17m)
being spent in the Office of Treaty Settlements (compared to $11,607m for the Waitangi
Tribunal). 
Results of the process have included:<P>
 Settlements totalling over $182m have been made since 1991-92, and a further $500m has
been
set aside to settle claims through to 1999;<P>
 A backlog building up of uncleared claims (an estimated 582 by June 1996);<P>
 Less than half of 137 recommendations of the tribunal have been implemented, with 6%
rejected
  outright and 'no start' made on 22%;<P>
 Only 43 or 4% of the 1,194 surplus Crown lands advertised to Maori have been held back
from
  disposal. This is despite 4,653 applications being received to have lands held back from sale;
<P>
 To date, $73,176m has been spent on holding land in land banks pending future
settlements.<P>
The report concludes: <P>
 There is a need to complete and make public a comprehensive Treaty settlement policy;<P>
 An integrated budget is required for the entire process;<P>
 Formal sharing of information between the agencies involved is required;<P>
 Some agencies in the settlement process have dual roles which add an "avoidable degree of
  complexity", because in this area the government has the dual objectives of fairness to
claimants
  and affordability to taxpayers;<P>
 The surplus land claims mechanism is under strain;<P>
 An integrated system for monitoring and reporting progress in claim settlements is
required.<P>

<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>In re Proprietors of Te Uranga B2 Block  </H3>
<I> Aotea MB, 19 October. 1995 Savage J </I><P>
An incorporation applied under s358/1993 for an order that 401 hectares of land be
reclassified as
investment land. Section 358 provides that incorporations may apply to have lands acquired
after their
establishment reclassified as investment lands, and their status changed to general land, freeing
them
from the restrictions of Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. At the suggestion of the court when
the
application was first raised, the incorporation passed a special resolution supporting the
application
by roughly 2 shares to one. The incorporation also applied to have its objects made unlimited
under
s358A/1993.<P>
Held: under the 1993 Act incorporation land is no longer owned by an incorporation except as
trustee,
the land belonging to the beneficial owners who are shareholders. The effect of an order under
s358
is that the investment land is removed from the trust and the incorporation becomes the sole
owner,
the beneficial owners lose their interest and merely retain incorporation shares in relation to
that land.
The committee of management of the incorporation may then alienate the land as they see fit.
This
is a serious step as it takes away rights from owners, their descendants and members of the
preferred
classes of alienees. Prima facie such an order runs counter to the objects of the 1993 Act but
can be
justified as the land is acquired after the formation of the incorporation and is not taonga tuku
iho,
although the owners may still have important links with it. Unfortunately there was no clear
statement
here of what the land meant to the owners.<P>
Neither the resolution, the accompanying notice and statements explaining the resolution, or
minutes
of the meeting to consider the special resolution indicated that the owners had been made
aware that
they had rights which would be extinguished by a s358 order and that the land would cease to
be
Maori land. The court was reluctant to make an order where those two points had not been
made
clear, and there was not "substantial support well in excess of the majority" in favour of the
application.
This was a situation quite foreign to the general law of Aotearoa, allowing an owner of an
interest in land
to have that interest taken, perhaps even against their express wishes. The incorporation is
kaitiaki for the
owners, and the court will not change the status of Maori land or take away owners interests
lightly. A
majority voting for the conversion to investment land is significant but the rights of the
minority are also
important (s17(2)(d)/1993). Leave was given to make a further application after a fresh
approach had been
made to the owners. <P>
As to the application to have the objects of the incorporation made unlimited, Parliament had
not
intended that incorporations established before the 1993 Act should automatically have their
objects made
unlimited, otherwise it would not have given a discretion to the court. The incorporation was
well managed
and financially sound. It was keen to use its assets as a base for financial ventures off the
incorporation
lands. Accordingly, the court ordered that the objects be redefined to conform with
s353(a)-(b)/1993 but
subject to the limitation that no activity conducted off the corpus land should involve the
pledging or
mortgaging of that land or otherwise encumbering it for the purposes of security.<P>

<H3>  Turangi Township Report 1995</H3>
<I>  11 September 1995. GS Orr (presiding officer), IH Kawharu, HR Young, EM Stokes
</I><P>
<I>Background</I><P>
In 1963 the Crown had developed detailed plans for the Tongariro Power Development
scheme,
involving the collection of waters from catchments in the central plateau region of the North
Island
and the construction of 2 power stations, one being at Tokaanu on the shores of Lake Taupo.
The
Ngati Turangitukua hapu of Ngati Tuwharetoa owned lands in this area. Four sites were
identified
by Crown officials for a town to accommodate workers for the scheme. While only a
temporary town
was required, the Crown preferred to build a permanent township, and favoured a site on
Maori
owned land over other sites on Crown owned land. <P>
In May 1964 a first meeting was held with the owners and the township proposal was
outlined.
Undertakings were given that full compensation would be provided for lands taken. The
proposal was
endorsed in principle by the meeting. A further meeting with owners (as opposed to meetings
with
individuals and a liaison committee) was held on 20 September 1964. The following day
Cabinet
approved the construction of the TPD and the compulsory taking of 900 acres and lease of
200 acres
of Ngati Turangitukua land. Ten days later bulldozers began entering the township site,
operating on
tight deadlines to develop the area. <P>
Implied power to enter the land was provided by Order in Council under s311 Public Works
Act 1928
giving authority to construct all necessary works in connection with the utilization of water
power and
with no provision for prior notice or objections. In December 1964 the Turangi Township Act
provided for a form of local government for the township, but without specific representation
for
Maori owners (although Maori practically did participate), and in a section added to cover
legal
concerns (s11), empowered the Crown to take by proclamation, again without notice or right
of
objection, 1540 acres and then sell it privately for the purpose of a permanent town. In 1965
the first
gazette notices taking the land appeared. <P>
<I>Tribunal findings</I><P>
It was doubtful whether the Crown had the legal authority to enter onto Maori land under
s311 Public
Works Act 1928 or s11 of the Turangi Township Act 1964 (which referred to s311) before
lands were
taken by proclamation, and prior notification of entry may have been a legal requirement (as
opposed
to some verbal then written notification which was voluntarily given). The engineering work
on the
ground proceeded far ahead of legal and clerical work required to complete procedures for
Crown
proclamations taking land or to begin negotiations on compensation for the owners.<P>
Many of the more than 20 undertakings given by the Crown at the meetings of owners were
not honoured
either in part or in whole. Although the Crown undertook that no more than 800-1000 acres
would be
taken, 1665 acres were eventually taken. An assurance that 186 acres required for industrial
development
would be leased and not acquired was broken. There was a failure "in numerous instances" to
protect
waahi tapu. There had also been problems with a water supply reserve, water reticulation to
some
dwellings, river development works and some degradation of waterways and fishing areas.
<P>
The sovereignty gained by the Crown under article 1 is limited by the guarantee of
rangatiratanga and
other matters under article 2. This limited sovereignty does not create a constitutional
problem, as
few if any western governments enjoy unqualified sovereign power (membership of
international
organisations being one example). The Crown may override article 2 guarantees only in
exceptional
circumstances and as a last resort in the national interest. The <I>Ngai Tahu Ancillary Claims
Report
1995</I> expressed the provisional view that the power of compulsory acquisition of Maori
land for a
public work be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and as last resort in the national
interest.
A lesser test is insufficient. Court of Appeal comments that Treaty principles cannot place
"unreasonable
restrictions" on the right of an elected government to follow its policy (<I>NZ Maori
Council</I>
case) do not justify a lesser test. The Crown obligation according to the Court of Appeal is
'active
protection to the fullest extent reasonably practicable'. While conservation may be one of these
exceptional circumstances, there is a critical difference between legislation providing for the
control and
management of resources and that providing for their expropriation.<P>
The tribunal rejected a Crown contention that it apply other than present Treaty standards to
actions
in the past. It also could find no evidence to support a Crown contention that the claimants
had
revised over the intervening years the value (apart from inflationary adjustment) they placed
on land
and waahi tapu. Nor did it find helpful the submission that the onus of proof lay entirely on the
claimants. The tribunal is not a court but a commission of inquiry and looks to all parties to
assist
in completing its inquiry. Nor should contemporary documentation be given automatic
preference over
the personal recollections of those involved.<P>
The provisions of the 'draconian' 1928 and 1964 Acts were tantamount to a "unilateral
abrogation"
of article 2 rights in that they allowed Maori land to be compulsorily acquired, and without a
legal
requirement of prior consultation or notice. Although the Public works Act 1981 amends
some of
these matters, it still fails to acknowledge Crowns obligations as a partner under the Treaty.
The
Crown was under an obligation to ensure no other land was available for the township, give
consideration
to gaining a leasehold rather than freehold, and ensure that there was provision for the return
of any land
no longer required for the public work. Consequently, there had been a failure:<P>
- to adequately investigate alternative sites or assess the likely social or environmental
impact;<P>
- to give adequate consideration to the desirability of protecting rangatiratanga by acquiring
the
  leasehold rather than the freehold of lands for the township and water supply reserve;<P>
- to make provision in the 1928 and 1964 acts for the return of surplus lands at least cost and
  inconvenience to former Maori owners. While the 1981 Act makes provision for an offer
back, it
  is inconsistent with Treaty principles in that it allows the Crown in certain circumstances to
dispense
  with an offer back, without consultation with the former owners, and to set the offer back at
market
  rates, without taking full account of the detriment of the original taking. It also allows the
Crown to
  retain the full profit from the sale;<P>
- the Crown failed to consult fully with the owners about the land to be taken for the township
before
  it was taken;<P>
- apart from a few notable exceptions, it failed, during construction of the township, to treat
Ngati
  Turangitukua with the respect due to them as tangata whenua. In particular there was a
failure to
  recognise and protect the sensibilities of kaumatua;<P>
- there was a failure to keep Turangitukua properly informed about government intentions and
actions
  as the township was developed;<P>
- there was also a failure to honour undertakings that waahi tapu would be protected, by the
adoption
  of a reactive rather than proactive approach to protection;<P>
- there was a failure to act upon the high importance owners placed on conservation matters,
leading
  to some degradation of waterways and fishing, and increased flooding;<P>
- inadequate consultation led to a failure to mitigate the adverse social repercussions and
trauma of
  the development.<P>
The 1928 Act failed to provide adequate compensation for the takings. Having chosen to take
ancestral
land and disperse claimants from it, there was a heavy obligation on the Crown to treat the
people
generously. Because of poor consultation, Turangitukua could not be said to have been willing
sellers.  There was also a failure to consider preserving a sufficient economic base of land for
Turangitukua.<P>
<I>Recommendations  </I><P>
The tribunal endorsed the view of the <I>Ngai Tahu Ancillary Claims Report 1995</I> that
before any
compulsory acquisition of Maori land can occur, Treaty principles require that: <P>
- owners are given adequate notice and the Crown must seek to obtain informed consent by
full
consultation;<P>
- if the owners are unwilling to sell, the compulsory acquisition power might be used only in
exceptional
  circumstances and as a last resort in the national interest;<P>
- a lease or interest less than the freehold should be sought, and on terms to be agreed or
determined
  by arbitration. If it is felt that the freehold must be acquired, that question should be
determined
  by an independent body. <P>
This tribunal added the requirement that the Crown not seek Maori land without first ensuring
no
other suitable land is available.<P>
The Public Works Act 1981 should be amended to take account of these requirements, and it
should
also provide that for lands taken and later found to be surplus to requirements:<P>
- the Maori owners be consulted where there is any intention not to offer the land back to the
former
owners; <P>
- any offer back should be at the earliest possible opportunity and at least cost and
inconvenience to
  the former owners;<P>
- when setting an offer back price, provision should be made to; share with the former owners
the
  increased value arising from development of the land, have regard to the means of the former
  owners to take up the offer, have regard to circumstances surrounding the original
compulsory
  acquisition, and the special problems of multiple ownership;<P>
- an offer back to a wider hapu or tribal group to which the former owners belong should be
possible
  if the former owners are unable or unwilling to purchase;<P>
The 1981 Act should also be amended to provide that the Act be interpreted and administered
so as
to give effect to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.<P>
As to the Turangitukua grievances, the tribunal recommended direct negotiation with the
Crown, with
the possibility of a further hearing on remedies if either or both of the parties request it. <P>
[ed: most previous tribunal reports have dealt with the actions of persons long dead, or with
events
in the immediate past. This report deals with events a little over 30 years ago and many of the
persons criticised in the report are still alive. The tribunal did not hear directly from the
government
officials involved at the time, and the report has been criticised in the media on that basis. <P>
This is the second report in 1995 to express strong views about the limits which ought to be
placed
on compulsory acquisition of Maori land. This is linked to a notion which the report develops
of 
'sovereignty limited by the Treaty'. The tribunal says that while there is an obvious case for the
Crown to override article 2 guarantees in order to conserve endangered species and limited
natural
resources, interference with rangatiratanga over Maori land for social and economic planning
purposes
is a different matter, and moreover, a constitutional one. The implications of this are far
reaching.]<P>

<H3> Memorandum following 8th hearing of Ngati Awa and other claims of the eastern Bay
of Plenty </H3>
<I>Wai 46 & Others,  27 September 1995. GS Orr for the tribunal  </I><P>
In this memorandum the tribunal considered whether it had power to make findings on the
legality
of Crown actions taken under the NZ Settlements Act 1863 confiscating large areas of Maori
land in
the Bay of Plenty. The tribunal determined that it does have jurisdiction, in appropriate
circumstances,
to determine questions of the legality of Crown action, and this included actions under the
1863
legislation relating to these claims.<P>
The tribunal also made comments about its powers under s6(3) to consider remedies for well
founded
claims. It noted the preliminary view of some members that this includes the ability to consider
the
present and future needs of tribes rather than simply making an accounting for past loss. Also,
assessing past loss solely on the basis of those actually in occupation of land at the time it was
expropriated may fail to take into account other important values of Maori culture eg
associational
interests of those not in occupation.<P>

<H3>  Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Ltd v Attorney-General & Others</H3>
<I>CP 199/95 HC Wellington, 3 October 1995. Doogue J  </I><P>
The plaintiff sought an interim order by way of declaration that the Crown and Land
Corporation
agencies not permit any change in the present status of certain lands within the Ngai Tahu
rohe. The
basic concern was that no Crown land owned by a Crown agency such as a State-owned
Enterprise
(SOE) should pass from Crown control or ownership until the principal Ngai Tahu claim is
settled.
Discussions between the parties had reduced the properties concerned to those where there
were no
current offers to buy the lands.<P>
Held:  the Court of Appeal decision in the <I>NZ Maori Council</I> case ([1987] 1 NZLR
641)
resulted in s27 State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986 being amended to provide that the
existence of any claim
under s6 Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 does not prevent the transfer of land out of Crown or
SOE hands,
and ss27A-27D provided for titles to such lands to carry memorials providing for compulsory
return
to Maori claimants if the Waitangi Tribunal recommended it. The critical issue was whether
this
statutory regime sufficiently protected the plaintiff s interests pending determination of the
substantive
proceeding and the plaintiff s land claims.<P>
The plaintiffs argued that various problems of a legal, political and human nature could arise
which
would not allow the protective mechanism of ss27A-D to operate in the simple way the
Crown
contended. A third party land owner could seek to avoid an application for compulsory return.
A
purchaser of land, because of the existence of the memorial, could run it down rather than
improve
it. It was not clear whether vacant possession would pass on resumption of the land by Maori
where
a third party purchaser had granted a lease either long-term or in perpetuity. Also, where many
properties were involved, Ngai Tahu might have considerable difficulty persuading the
Waitangi
Tribunal to make all the necessary orders for return. Litigation in this respect was pending (CP
215/95 Wellington Registry see <I>Maori LR</I> Sept 95 p1). It was also argued that
ss27A-D were
passed with the expectation that claims would be dealt with promptly, the failure of the Crown
to
sufficiently fund the tribunal meant there was no certainty the plaintiff s claim would be dealt
with in the
reasonably forseeable future. <P>
This was an application for interim relief. The balance favoured the plaintiffs, who arguably
could
be prejudiced through a failure to make the interim order sought. The status quo was in favour
of a
situation where the Landcorp lands remained not subject to sale. The presence of a land bank
in
favour of Ngai Tahu was not relevant. Once land was sold by Landcorp it was outside the
immediate
control of the Crown who would have to resort to the statutory scheme and powers under the
Public
Works Act 1981 to resume it, which made future problems 'almost inevitable'. The longer the
delays
in dealing with the plaintiff's claim the greater these inevitable problems would become. <P>
An undertaking by the plaintiffs as to damages would not be required in respect of the interim
order
as, for example, the parties might in the meantime agree to alter the parcels of land the subject
of the
interim order.<P>
[ed: although affecting only 37 properties in the South Island, this is a significant decision,
suggesting
that the court might, at the substantive hearing, accept that practical difficulties have
overwhelmed
the original intent of the resumptive scheme in some regions.]<P>

<H3>  Faulkner v Tauranga District Council</H3>
<I>  AP 29/94, 8 September 1995. Blanchard J</I><P>
The appellant held a lease over just over 12.5 hectares of land vested in a s438/1953 trust. The
district council successfully sued for rates. The appellant appealed on the basis that the land
was
Maori customary land, which is exempt from rates under s182(1) Rating Powers Act
1988.<P>
Held: the land at issue had been continuously occupied for centuries, and the Ngaiterangi iwi
had title
by right of conquest prior to the Treaty of Waitangi. Ngaiterangi fought alongside Kingitanga
followers
at Tauranga and surrendered to the Crown in 1864. At a meeting with the Governor in August
1864 the
mana or authority to decide the fate of the land was placed at the discretion of the Governor.
He exercised
that discretion by agreeing with the iwi not to confiscate more than one quarter of
Ngaiterangi's land. An
Order in Council in May 1865 confiscated Ngaiterangi lands under the NZ Settlements Act
1863. The
Tauranga District Lands Act 1867 validated the confiscation and mentioned the agreement
with the iwi,
leaving it to the Governor to set apart lands for Ngaiterangi within the confiscation after "due
inquiry".
It was not until 1885 however that a Native Land Court judge, HW Brabant, acting as
Commissioner of
Tauranga Lands, issued a certificate of title for a block, Ohuki No 1, including the land now in
dispute.
In 1888 Brabant, acting now as a Native Land Court judge, issued a succession order for one
of the former
owners in Ohuki No 1 under the Native Land Court Act 1886.<P>
The Native Land Court Act 1894 provided that "customary land" included all land held under
Maori
customs and usages whose title had been ascertained by the court or "other duly-constituted
authority", and
that all such land was held in fee simple and subject to the Land Transfer Act. This position
was preserved
by subsequent legislation in 1909, 1931 and 1953.<P>
The land block the subject of this case was created by partition orders affecting Ohuki No 1 in
1914
and 1921. The s438 trust order made in 1972 described the land as Maori freehold land. In
1986 the
District Land Registrar issued a title stating that the trustees held a fee simple estate in the
land.<P>
While the Rating Powers Act 1988 does not define Maori customary land, it is unlikely
Parliament
intended that phrase when used in the Act to mean other than the term as defined in the then
Maori
Affairs Act 1953 and now Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 (the difference in the wording of the
definition
between the 1953 and 1993 Acts does not appear to be significant).<P>
Customary land in the 1953 Act is land the ultimate or allodial title of which is, as with all NZ
land,
vested in the Crown, but in respect of which Maori continue to have a customary title
recognised by
the common law and confirmed by Article 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi - <I>R v Symonds</I>
(1847)
NZPCC 387 and <I>Te Weehi v Regional Fisheries Officer</I> [1986] 1 NZLR 680. It was
noted
however that Crown land as defined under the Land Act 1948 specifically excludes Maori
customary land.
Customary or aboriginal title is a burden on the Crown s feudal title which can be extinguished
only
by means of a deliberate Act authorised by law and unambiguously directed towards that end.
Unless
there is specific statutory provision, customary title remains even where the Executive grants
land
to someone other than the customary owners, <I>Nireaha Tamaki v Baker</I> (1901)
NZPCC 37.
Customary title does not disappear by a side wind. Extinguishment must be plainly intended,
as <I>Mabo
v The State of Queensland (No 2)</I> (1992) 175 CLR 1, 64 and <I>Te Weehi</I>
demonstrate.
But neither of these cases dealt with the effect on customary title where land is brought under
the Torrens
system and an indefeasible fee simple title issued.<P>
Neither the differing decisions of the Privy Council in <I>Kapua Haimona</I> [1913] AC 761
and
<I>Te Paea v Tareha</I> [1902] AC 56 as to the effect of proclamations and orders in council
under
the NZ Settlements Act 1863, nor the fact that the Order in Council of May 1865 did not refer
to land
being "taken", nor the issue of a commissioner's certificate rather than a Crown grant, could
defeat the
clear words of the Tauranga District Lands Act 1867 that the whole of the Tauranga District
was taken
for settlement. Consequently the customary title was extinguished. When Ngaiterangi had the
Ohuki lands
later restored to them the commissioner's certificate was equivalent to an order of the Native
Land Court.
The Native Land Court Act 1894 also confirmed that customary land included lands where the
owners
had been ascertained by a duly constituted authority, in this case the commissioner, and placed
them
under the Land Transfer Act as fee simple estates. While <I>In re Rotomahana and Taheke
Blocks</I>
(1909) 24 NZLR 203 did suggest that some provisions of the 1894 Act were purely
registrarial in effect,
it did not contradict the above conclusion. This was confirmed in the case of <I>A-G v
Ruritana</I>
(1909) 24 NZLR 228. <P>
Where land is held by way of an estate in fee simple, especially where title is registered under
the
Land Transfer Act, the title must be regarded as one derived from the Crown. It is impossible
to say
that such a title is merely Crown recognised and continues, so far as the fee simple owners are
concerned, to be held according to custom. This is supported by comments in <I>Te Paea v
Tareha</I> p65. This does not however prevent the registered proprietors holding the land
beneficially
for an iwi or a section of an iwi. The rights of the beneficial owners may continue to be
governed by
custom. Comments made by Sir John Salmond in the introduction to the Native Land Act
1909 about the
intent of the Native Land Court Acts of 1886 and 1894 also supported this conclusion.<P>
Accordingly, the council was entitled to recover rates from the land.<P>
[ed: the Rating Powers Act 1988 also provides at s182 that on the recommendation of the
Maori Land
Court and with the consent of the relevant district council, the Governor-General may exempt
Maori
freehold land from rates. Over 1500 hectares in the Ruapehu district have recently been
exempted
under this provision - see <I>NZ Gazette</I> 5 October 1995 p3511.]<P>

amount
  of any solatium payment the Land Valuation Tribunal is to have regard to, among other
things, the

of
  attachment the former owner has to the land, in particular by having been associated with it
for a

Maori
of land taken under the Public Works Act. It is ironic to see that the owners' attachment to the
land must
be taken into account in determining the value of any solatium payment. This amendment was
forced on
the government because it did not otherwise have the majority to pass the measure. The select

Disability Services Act 1993, regional health authorities (RHAs) are required to consult with
the
community and take the special needs of Maori into account. This very requirement appears to
have
allowed the RHAs, the Ministry of Health and Te Puni Kokiri to disregard mounting concern
expressed
by the Hepatitis Foundation that a screening programme was urgently required and insist that
nothing more
than community education programmes about the disease were needed. The select committee
recommended, among other matters, that a screening programme be established as soon as
practicably
possible.<P>

Apart from receiving improved assistance through the extension of "Job Action" and "Youth
Action"
schemes (providing intensive personal assistance to long term and youth unemployed) and by
changed
benefit abatement rates for those on the Domestic Purposes Benefit, the government has
developed
a Maori Labour Market Strategy. This combines immediate measures such as re-establishment
of the
Wahine Pakiri scheme (providing business training to Maori women) and limited subsidies to
communities
to undertake development of Maori-owned assets, with education initiatives to reduce
unemployment over
the longer term.<P>

<H3>  Draft Minerals Programmes</H3>
<I>Energy & Resources Division Ministry of Commerce. September 1995  </I><P> 
Separate draft programmes have been publicly notified (30 September 1995) for Coal,
Industrial
Rocks and Building Stones, and Metallic and Non-Metallic Minerals, pursuant to s14 Crown
Minerals
Act 1991. All 3 draft programmes, in accordance with s4/1991 (principles of the Treaty be
taken into
account when powers are exercised) provide that consultation occur in the preparation of each
minerals programme, and before any prospecting, exploration or mining permits are issued or
extended. Mount Taranaki and associated Pouakai, Pukeiti and Kaitake ranges are excluded
from the
programmes in recognition of their importance to Maori. The draft programme for Metallic
and
Non-Metallic Minerals notes the government policy that in view of ongoing discussions to
settle Ngai
Tahu claims, no permits will be available for pounamu. Consultation hui have already been
held over
these draft programmes. An iwi discussion document on the programmes is available on
request.
Submissions are required before 27 November 1995. <P>

Programme
for Petroleum which was finalised in January 1995, see <I>Maori LR</I> May 1994 p7 &

<H2><HR> Maori Land Court and Appellate Court </H2>
<H3>  Tauhara Middle 4A1L1B1A and Northcroft</H3>
<I>  9 Waiariki ACMB 49, 27 October 1995. Hingston, Spencer, Isaac JJ</I><P>
A husband willed his interest in Maori land to his wife. Under s164/1993 she made a gift of the
land
to one of the children of her husband s brother. The executor of the brother s estate argued
that the
gift should have been in trust to all of his children and that the court should not have approved
the
gift.<P>
Held: the appellant, being the son of the husband s brother, was a member of the preferred
class of
alienees and was  materially affected  by the order and therefore had standing to bring the
appeal
under s58/1993. The meaning of  materially affected  was discussed in <I>Awarua 3D34B
McCarthy
v Collerton</I> (1961) 12 Whanganui ACMB 75.<P>
The fact that the MLC had dealt with the application by telephone conference (the donor had
arthritis)
did not affect the outcome. Section s69/1993 enables the MLC to receive any information
which in
its opinion will assist proceedings. The judge was satisfied he was dealing with the donor. The
donor
was aware of the dispute among the children but still intended the gift for the one child.
Consequently
the appeal failed.<P>
When alienations are subject to preferred class preference, being of the class does not give a
person
rights against others in the preferred class. The provision is a shield protecting all the preferred
class
from outsiders entering the title. For the appellant to succeed in this case he would have to
have
established grounds exclusive of preferred class considerations, although the court would take
account
of remoteness from the alienor where close relatives of a donor object to a gift to a more
distant
relative. Being of the preferred class is a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction by
the
court and not a cause of action.<P>
Directions for service of applications under s164/1993 should take account of the value of the
gift,
the relationship of the donor and donee, the age of the donor and the views of the donor s
immediate
family. Few family members would require to be notified of a proposed gift of low value to
one
child, as opposed to a large value gift exclusively to one child. <P>

</I><P>
This was an appeal against an order under s338(7)/1993 appointing new trustees to a Maori
reservation.
The court noted that <I>Mount Tauhara Maori Reservation</I> (1977) 58 Taupo MB 168
and reg 7
Maori Reservations Regulations 1994 establish that, in matters relating to the administration
of a
reservation, trustees should consult with the beneficiaries. The rules of natural justice do not
however
apply to meetings to discuss proposed new trustees because there is no right or interest
affected by
meetings (as determined by the test in <I>Durayappah v Fernando</I> [1967] 2 AC 337 (PC)
at 349).
Appointments are made by the court. Meetings simply decide the evidence which will be put
to the court.
It is in court that interests are affected and natural justice and legitimate expectations issues
may arise. The
complicated rules of administrative law ought not to be imposed on the workings of Maori
reservations.
There remains however a duty to act fairly, although different consequences flow from a
breach of this
duty. Unfairness at a meeting will affect the weight the court will place on the evidence
coming from it -
see <I>Ongarahu B and Eriapa Maru Uruamo</I> 3 Tok ACMB 230. There was nothing on
the face
of the evidence from the meeting to suggest the court should inquire further, and the court
cannot be put
on inquiry in every case where the evidence contains no hint of discord, impropriety or lack of
representation. Nor had the lower court itself acted unfairly or failed to address issues in terms
of
ss17(2)(a) and (e) (concerning empowerment of owners and unfairness). The present appellant
had
not taken the opportunity to question or oppose the evidence before the lower court.
Although one
trustee had not been voted on by the beneficial owners, voting is a "red herring" where the
meeting
has no power to decide. The trustee had been discussed and was acceptable to those 'involved
with
the reservation'.<P>

The Maori Land Court refused an application to call a meeting of owners to consider a
proposal to
sell a block of land. The majority ownership were non-hapu and the proposed purchaser was
thought
not to be of the preferred class of alienees. In an oral judgment the court noted that, when the
court
is considering under s173/1993 whether to call a meeting of owners it should not, by virtue of
s2/1993 (which refers to the control of Maori land being retained by Maori owners), give
undue
weight to the needs of Maori owners. The provisions of Part IX/1993 and the Maori
Assembled
Owners Regulations 1995, cl2 of which defines 'owners' to include all those with an interest,
legal
or equitable, in Maori land, are a special code and take precedence for the purposes of
s173.<P>
During the hearing the court also noted, although made no decision on the issue, the finding of
Isaac
J (in <I>Re Nuhaka 2E3C8A2B, Maori LR</I> September 1994 p2) that when considering
whether
a person falls within the preferred class of alienees, one may look beyond the immediate block
and
consider whether a person is a descendant of those in the original land block prior to partition.
The
proposed purchaser in this case was from a "well known" local Maori family.<P>

<H2><HR>  Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>  Kiwifruit Marketing Report 1995</H3>
<I> Wai 449. 6 October 1995. Judge PJ Savage (presiding), MR Bassett, JT Kneebone, JJ
Turei
</I><P>
This report concerned a claim that the right to export kiwifruit is a taonga enjoying the
protection of
Article 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi. The claimants were Marata Norman of Ngati Moko, a
hapu of
Tuhourangi iwi in the Bay of Plenty, and Wi Parera Te Kani of the Ngai Tukairangi hapu of
the Ngai Te
Rangi iwi.<P>
Firstly, the tribunal rejected the view that the claim could be ruled out as frivolous and
vexatious.
Had there been a greater appreciation within the industry of the Treaty and cultural issues, this
expensive claim would not have been needed. It raised important issues.<P>
The tribunal expressed concern that the claim appeared to proceed in the name of a limited
liability
company and some Maori land trusts. Claims must be made by Maori only (s6(1) Treaty of
Waitangi
Act 1975). Claims need to be framed with care to avoid these problems. A claim may however
in
reality be made by Maori even though a Pakeha vehicle is chosen to advance it. In such cases
the
tribunal might look behind the corporate veil. In other cases Maori may only be affected as
shareholders,
in which case the trust or incorporation itself would be advancing the claim. Each case has
different factors
and the decision is a matter of balance and perception. This was a claim by Maori, but might
easily have
been held otherwise.<P>
The basic claim was that the right to export kiwifruit is a taonga enjoying the protection of
Article
2 of the Treaty. The evidence heard was unnecessarily wide in some areas, but established that
Maori
grew and traded a variety of foods prior to 1840 with the clear understanding that some would
find
their way overseas.<P>
The claimants had been involved in the kiwifruit industry for some years, with financial
encouragement
in the early stages from the Department of Maori Affairs. After a fall in returns for nearly all
growers in
1987, a referendum was held in 1988 in which over 80% of orchards voted for a marketing
board to be
established. Those who voted 'yes' included Marata Norman s orchard. The NZ Kiwifruit
Marketing
Board (NZKMB) was established in September 1988 as a result of that referendum.<P>
Among other things, the claimants alleged they were encouraged to enter an industry with
unreliable
returns, were not consulted separately in 1988, that Maori kiwifruit farming required special
consideration
before policies were set by the NZKMB, and that current regulations allowing selling only
through the
board prevent the claimants exercising their rangatiratanga.<P>
The tribunal found that the NZKMB is an agent of the Crown - although this finding was not
essential
to the central finding of the report. The central issue was whether the right to export is a
taonga under
Article 2. Pre-contact exchanges of treasures by iwi and hapu might be regarded as taonga.
But it
would be "an unjustified straining of Treaty principles to hold that the right to develop such a
treasure
could extend all the way to the modern kiwifruit trade." There was insufficient evidence before
the tribunal
that post-contact trade in the period prior to 1840 was a taonga. There was no evidence that
Maori
themselves exported - although they did trade with others who onsold overseas. The right to
export would
if anything be an Article 3 right. But even if these findings were wrong this also did not affect
the central
finding. <P>
The central finding was that the sovereignty ceded by the Treaty included the right to regulate
trade.
A memorandum issued by the tribunal sitting to hear the Chatham Islands claims set out the
position
correctly, that the Maori text of the Treaty, when examined in the light of contemporary
statements,
did cede sovereignty, which was a form of national controlling authority (5 October 1994, see
<I>Maori
LR</I> Oct 1994). The rangatiratanga retained is not therefore a separate sovereignty, but a
right to
tribal self-management. Tribunal members had differing opinions of what rangatiratanga
extended to, but
this claim fell outside even the broadest of those views. The regulation of trade was a
legitimate act of
governance or kawanatanga. The chiefs knew this, they mentioned trade as a matter for
general regulation
in the Declaration of Independence of 1835.<P>
There had been sufficient consultation with Maori before the NZKMB was established,
consisting of
input from the Department Maori Affairs, industry wide consultation prior to 1988 and the
referendum
in 1988. The consultation was sufficient to the circumstances - the tribunal repeated Sir Ivor
Richardson s
statement in the <I>NZ Maori Council v Attorney-General</I> case (p683) that in some cases
specific
consultation may not be required where a Treaty partner has sufficient information for it to act
consistently
with Treaty principles. The tribunal was less certain that there had been adequate consultation
since the
establishment of the NZKMB. There was no evidence that policy makers had considered the
special
restrictions owners of multiple owned Maori land face, or the different perspectives on
cultivating land
which Maori have. But there was no evidence either that Maori growers had made special
efforts to bring
these matters to the attention of the board. The tribunal was heartened by assurances that
there would be
greater consultation in the future and thought that at the very least Maori growers should be
actively
encouraged to participate in decision making in the industry, and become more involved with
marketing
to other indigenous peoples.<P>
There was no evidence that the Kiwifruit Marketing Regulations 1977 were contrary to s20
NZ Bill
of Rights Act 1990 (right of minorities to enjoy their culture), as there was no evidence that
Maori
rights to ancestral land were being endangered or Maori culture threatened by the
regulations.<P>
The issue of whether single desk selling is superior to other forms of marketing was irrelevant
to the
claim, although much evidence had been heard on this point. <P>
[ed: this is a brief report, but it makes important findings. In stating that sovereignty and
national
governance were ceded by Maori in 1840, the tribunal reaffirms a position it has held since the
<I>Muriwhenua Fishing Report 1988</I>. In that report, the tribunal found that it was a
legitimate
exercise of sovereignty or kawanatanga to pass laws to conserve natural resources. This report
extends that
further, finding that passing laws for the regulation of trade is also a legitimate exercise of
sovereignty.<P>
The tribunal in this report refused to stretch Treaty principles to cover the modern kiwifruit
trade.
This has similarities with the finding of the Court of Appeal in <I>Te Runanganui o Te Ika
Whenua
Inc</I> [1994] 2 NZLR p25 that the Treaty does not apply to another "modern" development
- the
generation of electricity by the use of water power (see also however the decision in <I>Ngai
Tahu
Maori Trust Board v D-G Conservation</I>, that a modern whale watching business is
"analogous to"
a taonga, but only because it has some parallels with pre-Treaty fishing and shore whaling (CA
18/95, 22
September 1995 <I>Maori LR</I> Sept 1995 p3)). Unfortunately the tribunal gives little
analysis of
how it arrived at this position.<P>
This report will no doubt be greeted with dismay by those pressing for an expansive view of
rangatiratanga, particularly as the tribunal has used the Declaration of Independence to
reinforce its
view that Maori ceded to the Crown substantial powers in 1840. That Declaration is often
quoted by
groups seeking to question the extent of Crown sovereignty.]<P>

<H2><HR>  Other Jurisdictions</H2>
<H3> William Tupu Awa v Independent News Auckland Ltd </H3>
<I>  CP 152/92 HC Hamilton, 16 October 1995.  Hammond J</I><P>
The plaintiff alleged that he was defamed by an article in the <I>Sunday News</I> national
newspaper
that described him as a "body snatcher", and sought damages of $200,000. The plaintiff was
the 'chief
kaumatua' of the Ngati Whawhakia hapu of Tainui. On the death in August 1991 of the well
known
entertainer Billy T James (whose adoptive mother was of Ngati Whawhakia), the plaintiff
travelled
to the entertainer s residence and removed the body to a marae before its burial on the sacred
Taupiri
mountain near Turangawaewae marae, Ngaruawahia. This was contrary to the wishes of close
relatives who had arranged a church service prior to transport to a marae.  <P>
Held: it is well known that Maori protocol upon death is quite different from European. In
particular,
the decision where a deceased is buried is important, and argument is not uncommon, the
greater
mana of the deceased may occasion greater debate. "The Maori way of approaching the
question of
burial is therefore part of a complex spiritual and metaphysical process which is intertwined
with the
extreme importance of recognition and acknowledgment of ancestors; and family; and the
burial
process is closely intertwined with land and the place from which one sprung." European style
rational
analysis could not do justice to the "coherent vision of an indigenous people."<P>
What must be considered is how the "ordinary reader", purchasing the paper from a corner
dairy,
would view the use of the term "body snatcher". Such a person would not take a far-fetched
or over
refined meaning, for example, that a body had been taken in breach of Maori custom. On this
"ordinary reader" test, the term "body snatcher", suggesting some immorality, was capable of
being
defamatory. However, a defence of justification was made out, the evidence showing, among
other
things, that the plaintiff was clearly not welcome when he arrived to fetch the body, and had
made
forcible entry to take it, and no true consent was gained from close relatives to take the body
in such
circumstances. A kaumatua witness for the claimant admitted that in such a situation it would
have
been appropriate to withdraw and speak to other kaumatua. The plaintiff s defence that Maori
protocol
required that he remove the body to a marae was really a misguided belief that the end justified
the
means. In these circumstances "body snatcher" was also fair comment on a matter of public
interest.<P>

<H3>  Paki & Others v Attorney General</H3>
<I> CP 144/90 HC Hamilton, 24 October 1995.  Anderson J </I><P>
The plaintiffs were trustees of Pouakani B9B Trust, and were, through Waitangi Tribunal
proceedings,
seeking the return of land in the Pouakani block alleged to have been wrongly taken by default
on a survey
agreement. In 1987 the plaintiffs bulldozed some trees on the contested land as an assertion of
their
claimed rights and to provoke litigation. The Department of Conservation filed proceedings
for trespass
and the plaintiffs responded with a notice of opposition. After discussion, the plaintiffs and the
Attorney
General entered an agreement in July 1987 preserving the position of both parties pending the
outcome of
Waitangi Tribunal and Maori Land Court investigations of title to the land. In that agreement
the Crown
agreed to indemnify the trustees for losses if they were successful as to land ownership and
boundaries
issues. The Waitangi Tribunal issued its report, largely vindicating the trustees, but not before
they had
incurred $1.23 million in expenses. The trustees issued proceedings seeking payment of this
sum. The
Crown responded in September 1990 with a $650,000 offer, provided the claimants accepted
it as a first
charge against Crown liability, if any should be found or acknowledged. This offer was
accepted. The
trustees amended their proceedings and now sought the balance of the $1.23 million on the
basis that it was
owed under the terms of the July 1987 agreement. This case concerned the effect of the
September 1990
agreement.<P>
Held: the September 1990 agreement was not an acknowledgement of liability by the Crown.
The
Crown had simply agreed that, should it subsequently acknowledge liability over the land
issues, or
have judgment entered against it, it was entitled to be credited with $650,000 against those
liabilities.
The agreement of September 1990 could not be treated as a mere repayment of expenses, but
was
actually a part-settlement of the claim. Its worth would be known when the Crown
acknowledged
liability, or when judgment was entered against the Crown. Conceivably, the plaintiffs might in
the
future get judgment against the Crown, but the practical outcome might be no more than an
accounting
entry. The parties needed to consider their future tactics in light of this situation.<P>

<H3>Whittaker v Maori Land Court of New Zealand  </H3>
<I>M2336/91 HC Auckland, 9 October 1995. Temm J  </I><P>
A woman sought an order under s452 Maori Affairs Act 1953 to rectify a succession order of
the
Maori Land Court made in 1943. She alleged that the MLC had at that time failed to award
land to
her mother, who was adopted. The Deputy Chief Judge turned down the s452 application.
There
being no right of appeal (s452(7)), the woman sought judicial review of the decision of the
Deputy
Chief Judge.<P>
Held: the adoption occurred in 1892 and was according to Maori custom. In <I>Hineiti
Rirerire Arani
v Public Trustee</I> [1920] AC 198 the Privy Council held that, after the passing of the
Adoption of
Children Act 1895, Maori children could be adopted either under that Act or continue to be
adopted
by Maori custom. So the adoptee had full legal rights as if she were a child born in wedlock.
After
1901 however, Maori customary adoptions had to be registered in the MLC for adopted
children to
succeed to their adoptive parents estate. However in 1909, in a radical change, s161(1) Native
Land
Act 1909 provided that all past and future Maori customary adoptions were without legal
effect.
Adoptions previously registered under the 1901 legislation were however saved. These
provisions
were considered in <I>Piripi v Dix</I> [1918] NZLR 691. The adoption in this case was not
registered and was therefore ineffective from 31 March 1910 when the 1909 legislation came
into effect. 
In December 1927 the position was completely reversed. Maori customary adoptions made
prior to
31 March 1902 were deemed to be of full legal effect (s5 Native Land Amendment and Native
Land
Claims Adjustment Act 1927). However, the adopted child died in November 1927, and so the
adoption was not  saved  by the 1927 legislation. The adoptive parent did not die till 1943. In
the
interim, in 1930, the 1927 amendment was reversed, and the position at 1910 reinstated, and
continued
in the Native Land Act 1931 (s202). This was the law in force when the adoptive parent died.
Consequently, there was no legal interest of the adopted child in the adoptive parent s estate
and
the Deputy Chief Judge had correctly dismissed the s452 application.<P>
The court also noted that the privative clause in s64/1953 effectively prevented it overturning
the
Deputy Chief Judge s decision in any event, as no error in law, unfairness, unreasonableness or
ultra
vires arguments were advanced (see <I>O Regan v Lousich</I> [1995] 2 NZLR 620).<P>
As to costs, it was understandable that the plaintiffs should bring this action. Section 98/1993
makes
special legal aid available. The power to award costs under that provision is however confined
to the
MLC. The court therefore noted a figure it thought the plaintiffs ought to be able to claim as
expenses,
and left it to them to make application under s98.<P>

<H3> Hauraki Maori Trust Board & Others v Waitangi Tribunal  </H3>
<I> CP 171/95 & Ors HC Wellington, 14 September 1995.  Ellis J </I><P>
This was an application to recall parts of a judgment (<I>Maori LR</I> August 1995 p3)
which
decided that the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission had not yet adopted a policy for the
distribution
of pre-settlement assets from the Sealord settlement and consequently, as a matter of law, the
Waitangi
Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear a claim until the commission adopted a policy. The recall
power
(r540 High Court Rules) gives the court discretion to  perfect  judgments. It was argued that
the
court could usefully elaborate on comments made in the judgment to further clarify its
intention, that
it had failed to take into account s6(1)(d) Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 (concerning actions, as
opposed to policies, of the Crown), and had failed to properly address the issue of the policy
behind
the interim allocation of fish quota.  <P>
Held: the application should not be granted, as the court had, before making judgment,
considered 
the matters for which recall was sought, but had deliberately refrained from comment;
elaboration
on the judgment would possibly require the hearing of further evidence; and the issues on
which recall
was sought were precisely those the subject of appeals to the Court of Appeal.<P>
The court indicated that it was aware that its earlier judgment meant that, under the provisions
of the
Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992, the Waitangi Tribunal might only
have
30 days to hold a hearing about the distribution policy from the time it is announced until it
becomes
final.<P>

stopping proposed major cuts in snapper quota in the northern fishery (<I>NZ Federation of

The Government has increased its ability to retain Crown lands surplus to requirements for use
in
future claim settlements. <P>
Claimants will now only need to satisfy the Crown that surplus land is of cultural and historical
importance and required for future development, or that is has special features making it "non-
substitutable". The Crown will then decide whether to retain the land on the basis of the value
of other
properties already retained, progress being made on negotiations and affordability. These new
criteria will
be applied to properties passed for sale under the old mechanism but not yet sold. Over 100
properties will
be immediately available for retention under the amended scheme.<P>
Properties will be retained in new regional land banks. $150 million has been set aside to
operate
these banks. The regions are based on 14 of the research districts the Waitangi Tribunal has
established
for its Rangahaua Whanui project. The Ngai Tahu rohe is excluded by agreement. All surplus
Crown lands
within the boundaries of areas confiscated last century remain separately protected for possible
future
return to claimants.<P>
[ed: in light of these announcements, the Waitangi Tribunal has vacated the fixture for an
urgent
hearing which was scheduled for 27 November on claim Wai 518, which is concerned with the
inadequacies of the system for retaining surplus Crown properties (Wai 518, doc 2.27, 21
November
1995).]<P>

<H3>  Extra resources for the Waitangi Tribunal</H3>
<I> DAM Graham, Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, 20 November
1995
</I><P>
An extra $500,000 will be allocated to the tribunal over the next 2 years. $400,000 will be
used
towards the completion of the Rangahaua Whanui project, which will provide research reports
on the
historical background to claims in 15 districts covering the country, as well as reports on
important
common themes eg public works takings, rating, the operation of the land court. $100,000 will
go
towards the writing of final tribunal reports on claims where hearings have been
completed.<P>

<H2><HR>The Year Ahead</H2>
The new year is a time for reflection and consideration of what lies ahead. This issue contains
statements of intent from various quarters for the coming months.
<P>
The Speech from the Throne promised in this Parliamentary term bills to modernise the laws
relating
to Maori trust boards and reserved lands, but otherwise it would be "steady as she goes".
<P>
The holiday period was more interesting. Pre-Christmas, Chairperson Chief Judge Durie
published
a full "state of the Waitangi Tribunal", referring repeatedly to funding constraints. The
Minister
of
Justice in early January promised more funding for the claims process, from within the Justice
vote,
and a publicity campaign on Treaty grievances conducted personally through the pages of the
Dominion (shouldn't a professionally organised PR campaign be a priority?). But with 2 new
prisons
to build and now night courts, will Justice find the money? And who gets it and in what
proportions;
the tribunal, or the Treaty Policy Unit, government's negotiating arm? In this regard the Justice
Department briefing papers were revealing for the emphasis they put on negotiations, and little
mention of the tribunal's funding concerns (this from the Department which services the
Waitangi
Tribunal). Te Puni Kokiri asked its Minister to consider whether direct negotiation is really a
fast
track to claim settlements, and pondered the difficulties and durability of "global settlements"
(ie
Sealords) and "fiscal envelopes". Professor Alan Ward (<EM>Evening Post</EM> 20
January)
stepped back and puts things in a useful historical perspective. He suggested slowing down,
forgetting the year 2000 as a date to settle major claims (a date the tribunal says it can meet)
and
establishing an accumulative settlement fund. The fund building up for Crown forest
settlements is
a good illustration of this approach.
<P>
Overshadowing all of this is the electoral reform debate (the tribunal heard a claim this week),
which
makes a change of policy in this whole area extremely likely at the next election. In light of
that,
academic Mai Chen has suggested multi-party talks. Certainly the present party based
approach
means that the Treaty of Waitangi Cabinet Committee has a very homogeneous look (see page
9)
and maybe could do with some assistance?
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>New Maori Land Court Judge</H3>
Wilson Isaac, a partner from Burnard Bull & Co, Gisborne, was appointed a judge of the
Maori
Land Court in December. Burnard Bull & Co has an extensive Maori land practice, including
among its clients major runanga, trusts and incorporations on the East Coast. The Judge is a
committee member of one incorporation. He has also undertaken Family Court work acting
mainly
for Maori families in custody and access matters. Judge Isaac has roots in Ngati Kahungunu
and
Tuhoe through his father and Scotland and Ngati Porou through his mother. Aged 40 years,
he
is
married with 3 children, and competes as a triathlete and runner. He will begin working from
Rotorua pending his appointment to a district (Tairawhiti (Gisborne court) and Takitimu
(Hastings
court) have no appointed judge at present).

<EM>Appeal 1993/20, 1993 Tai Tokerau ACMB 87, 16 December 1993, McHugh, Smith,
Carter, 9pp</EM><P>
In 1989 an elderly Maori man signed a transfer document allegedly gifting land to a woman
claiming to be his niece, and her husband. The man died in 1990. For various reasons an
application
for confirmation of the transfer was not filed in the MLC until May 1992. By this time the
immediate family had notified an objection. Further delays followed. In August 1993 the
application
was finally heard. The family raised several serious grounds against confirmation, including
unconscionable bargain and constructive fraud. These were not tested in court (the court had
requested attendance of witnesses for examination, but only affidavits were filed). Counsel for
the
niece and her husband sought an adjournment to prepare further submissions. The court
instead
noted the allegations made and allowed the family to withdraw the application for
confirmation, then
dismissed the matter. 
<P>
Held: the appeal should be allowed on 2 grounds. First, the MLC was wrong to allow one
party to
withdraw the application. Section 225(1)/1953 (now s151(1)(a)/1993) entitles any party to an
instrument of alienation to apply for confirmatio. This and associated MLC Rules recognise
the
peculiar nature of many Maori land applications, where rights of many persons might be
affected.
All have rights to be heard, including on questions as to withdrawal of applications. Second,
given
the serious nature of the allegations made, the refusal of an adjournment was a breach of
natural
justice; <EM>Ani Masefield Pihema and Orakei Marae</EM> 1990 ACMB 37 referred to (re
natural justice requirements when adjournments sought).
A rehearing was ordered. The MAC noted decisions in <EM>Re Papatupu 5A2 and
Pirikau</EM>
(1969) 12 Whanganui ACMB 317 and in <EM>Re Tikitiki D7B Tibble v Tibble</EM>

<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>1993 End of year statement</H3>
<EM>Te Manutukutuku No 26 December 1993</EM><P>
A succinct statement of the nature of the tribunal and its present approach. Contains some
obvious
messages for politicians and claimant groups. Concern about inadequate resourcing ($2.5
million
annum and over 320 outstanding claims) appears throughout the document, which mentions
several
times the need for more than the present one full time tribunal member. Under "Resources",
the
statement questions whether Maori have proper access to the legal process in this area. Other
comments made:<BR>
- the tribunal could hear all historical claims by the year 2000 (some 30 separate inquiries,
hearing
groups of claims, are needed to cover more than 320 claims)<BR>
- it is "regrettable" that claims about contemporary matters are now rarely considered because
of the
workload of historical claims<BR>
- "The Tribunal does not grant urgency to accommodate illegal occupations and will not
intervene
on matters that are or could be the subject of court proceedings"<BR>
- $400,000 annum is a "very small fund" for researching claims<BR>
- there is a need for statutory power to fund "claim managers"<BR>
- a strong research unit within the Crown Law Office is essential<BR>
- The Maori Land Information Office should be enabled to act directly on tribunal requests
rather
than just claimant requests<BR>
- there has been very little unnecessary duplication of research<BR>
- because it is not possible to sever the collection of facts from issues of interpretation the
tribunal
needs its own expert research staff<BR>
- the Rangahau Whanui project (broad historical survey of all historic claims in the country by
districts) is needed to avoid inequities of a seriatim approach to hearings which advantages
significantly those first heard<BR>
- on present evidence, all tribal groups probably have a valid claim of some sort and therefore
practical programmes to restore the tribal economic base seems the most practical course
- representation issues are a major impediment to claim resolution. The tribunal s preferred
approach, judicious use of the Maori Land Court, is canvassed. Queried whether the law
should be
altered to allow the tribunal to decline to hear tribal claims where tribal support is
lacking<BR>
- under "Servicing", the constraints of the State Sector Act and Justice Department
management
programmes on an independent tribunal are noted<BR>
- In 1994 the tribunal expects to produce 12 reports including reports on the Taranaki raupatu
and
Muriwhenua lands groups of claims, also Ngai Tahu ancillary claims, Orotu (Napier Inner
Harbour), Chathams, Turangi lands, Wellington Tenths, Otamarakau mining, Tinui forests, Te
Arawa geothermal, Ikawhenua power generation, Te Maunga public works [ed: an ambitious
programme, already under threat from urgent matters; ie the Maori electoral option hearing
this
week (reviewed next issue), and a Whanganui river hearing in March].
<P>
<H3>Re claims by Ngati Awa and Tuwharetoa Te Atua Reretahi ki Kawerau</H3>
<EM>Wai 46 & 62, 17 December 1993, Durie CJ</EM><P>
Ngati Awa sought a determination of customary rights over areas claimed by Tuwharetoa ki
Kawerau. They requested that the tribunal refer these issues by case stated to the Maori
Appellate
Court under s6A/1975. 
<P>
The Chairperson declined to refer the matter for the time being, noting that if Ngati Awa
contentions
as to the extent of their rights were upheld, Tuwharetoa ki Kawerau would fall entirely within
their
territory and thus have no independent status. On the basis of research before the tribunal:
section
6A may itself not accord with customary law in that it fixes narrowly the customary principles
applicable, also; Maori Appellate Court and Land Court approaches to customary interests
and
developed precedent should be questioned. The issue of limitations as to evidence and expert
assistance before the Appellate Court as opposed to a more flexible tribunal inquiry needs to
be
considered. The tribunal has a discretion whether or not to refer a case stated, and may choose
not
to do so if such a referral is not essential to the tribunal hearing and report on a claim. The real
issue
may not be the precise customary position, but rather how far customary interests have a place
in
a contemporary settlement.
<P>
[ed: the tribunal is clearly signalling a reluctance to use s6A, fearing the Appellate Court may
be
too bound by precedent based on challengeable views of customary law. The research referred
to
may include the PhD thesis of Angela Ballara  Origins of Ngati Kahungunu  which raises
questions
about Native Land Court views and distortions of customary law. Also see the note on Bryan
Gilling s article below].

<H3>NZ Maori Council and Others v A-G and Others</H3>
<EM>Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Appeal no 14/1993, 13 December 1993,
Templeton, Mustill, Woolf, Lloyd of Berwick, Eichelbaum. 17pp</EM><P>
Background<BR>
The Maori language is "in a state of serious decline . In 1988 the Crown restructured its
broadcasting operations. The Broadcasting Act 1989 put in place many features of those
changes.
It was intended to use the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986 to transfer television assets to a
new
state enterprise. The appellants alleged the proposed transfer would breach section 9 of the
1986
Act, as an action inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, without further
safeguards first being put in place to protect Maori language in television broadcasting. The
High
Court deferred consideration of the issue pending the preparation of a scheme of protection.
In
July
1991 the Crown approved an offer of $13 million for Maori programming over three years,
managed by a specialist Maori broadcasting funding agency. The appellants sought
amendments
which the Crown did not agree to. The High Court considered the scheme and granted a
declaration
permitting transfer, the appellants appeal of that decision was dismissed. The issue here was
whether
the transfer of assets could now or in the foreseeable future impair to a material extent the
Crown
ability to take reasonable action to fulfil its Treaty obligations.
<P>
Crown s Treaty obligations<BR>
The Maori language is a taonga. The Crown is under a solemn Treaty obligation to protect
Maori
property. The relationship between the Crown and Maori should be founded on
reasonableness,
mutual cooperation and trust. In protecting taonga the Crown need not go beyond what is
 reasonable in the prevailing circumstances". The obligation is constant but the protective steps
required may vary eg in an economic recession it may be reasonable not to engage in heavy
expenditure. How vulnerable the taonga is, is relevant, especially if vulnerability has arisen
from
past Crown actions. This would increase Crown responsibility.
<P>
Maori language<BR>
The failure to achieve any material exposure for Maori language on television has serious
implications for continuation of the language. The obligation of protection is shared and Maori
are
also required to take reasonable action, in particular in the home.
<P>
Nature of State Owned Enterprises<BR>
The 1986 Act s4(1) requires SOEs as successful businesses to be profitable, good employers
and
exhibit social responsibility. The first objective, creation of profit, is of no greater importance
than
the other two objectives. Therefore, if it has the financial resources, an SOE is perfectly
entitled to
be involved in loss or non-profit making activities. Subject to financial constraints, a state
enterprise
could run Maori programmes at a loss and still fulfil its statutory objective of being a
successful
business. In the foreseeable future Maori programming may not be profitable but there is no
reason
why it cannot be presented in an efficient and businesslike manner. A Crown protective ability
remains through s7/1986 (Crown agreements to fund all or part of the cost of non-commercial
activities). State enterprises remain creatures of the Crown. Through statements of corporate
intent
and the like the Crown can exercise a substantial degree of indirect control over the manner in
which
assets are employed. It is unlikely a state enterprise would seek to frustrate the Crown intent
once
made clear. The law-making powers of the Crown also remain. The transfer of assets would
make
control less direct and immediate, but otherwise only lessen the Maori ability to bring pressure
to
bear on the Crown. Section 9 is not a lever to compel the Crown to take positive action, but
operates
indirectly, in that it prevents transfers inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty, which in
turn
may force the Crown to come to arrangements to achieve the transfers it desires.
<P>
Effect of a transfer<BR>
Section 9 does not require the Crown to establish as a precedent fact that a transfer would not
be
inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty, the onus is on the appellants to show a transfer
is
not
permitted in the normal manner. The fact that fulfilment of Treaty obligations by the Crown is
a
policy matter does not limit a court to considering only whether a policy is unreasonable in the
<EM>Wednesbury</EM> sense (if this is what the Court of Appeal was suggesting they were
mistaken). It is relevant to read s9 in the light of other legislation (here the Broadcasting Act
1989,
already putting much of te restructuring in place). If assets are readily substitutable then it is
less
likely s9 will apply. The courts should approach these questions with a firm grip on reality as a
matter of practical politics if assets are unlikely to be replaced once transferred, replacement in
theory is of little significance. In practice the Crown can exert considerable control over state
enterprises. Therefore a transfer would have little if any effect on Crown obligations to
preserve the
language. Ministerial powers of intervention in state enterprise operations should be used
sparingly,
but, if required, are fully justified in this case given what is at stake. The present statement of
corporate intent providing for Maori programming under  Social Objectives  makes Crown
intervention less likely. The Crown assurance that existing offers would be honoured was
taken
into
account and creates a legitimate expectation the Crown will act on its assurance.
<P>
[ed: The judgment contains no comments on the constitutional position of the Treaty. The
case
was
argued strictly within the bounds of s9. Previous Privy Council findings that the Treaty is
unenforceable until incorporated into NZ law (<EM>Hoani Te Heuheu Tukino</EM> case)
were
not challenged. 
<P>
While acknowledging that SOEs were primarily established to clarify  sometimes competing
and
incompatible social and economic objectives , it was thought they could still voluntarily
engage
in
non-profit activities (of a considerable scale presumably) while receiving only partial or
conceivably
no reimbursement from the Crown. This interpretation of the  successful business  objective of
SOEs under the 1986 Act might make directors nervous. They may also be nervous about the
judgment s emphasis on the Crown ability to intervene in SOE operations to protect an
important
Maori taonga.
<P>
Given that there is an economic recession, that SOEs are intended primarily to be profit
making, and
that Maori language broadcasting requires considerable capital, have the Judicial Committee,
in
relying heavily on the Crown ability to indirectly control SOE behaviour, ignored  practical
politics 
themselves? Are Maori now able to use s9 to raise issues about the use assets are put to after
they
have been transferred to SOEs? 
<P>
A key problem for the appellants was the finding that, in asset transfers, s9 does not require
the
Crown to directly consider its Treaty obligations to the language, but only whether, after
transfer,
it <EM>could</EM> still reasonably protect the Maori language. Their Honours appeared to
be
impressed with Crown efforts to date, and noted that the assets in contention were already
informally
being used by the new broadcasting SOE (but on a  without prejudice  basis surely?). Overall,
perhaps not a  victory  for Maori, but rather a recognition that, once the Crown has decided
on
a
policy, s9 is only of limited use as a lever to compel the Crown to address its broad Treaty
obligations.]

<H3>Te Runanganui o Te Ika Whenua Inc Society & Another v A-G & Others</H3>
<EM>CA 124/93, 17 December 1993, Cooke P, Richardson, Casey, Hardie Boys, McKay,
13pp</EM><P>
Under the Energy Companies Act 1992, it was proposed to transfer the undertakings of the
Bay
of Plenty Electric Power Board and the Rotorua Electricity Authority to energy companies.
The
principal objective of these companies is to operate as successful businesses. The undertakings
included, for the Bay of Plenty Board, the Aniwhenua dam on the Rangitaiki river, and for the
Rotorua Authority, the Wheao dam on the Wheao river. The appellants, representing iwi and
hapu having interests in these rivers, sought interim relief preventing the transfer on the
grounds
that the Minister of Energy, in deciding to proceed to approve the transfers, had failed to
make
adequate inquiry of affected Maori interests, had failed to consult, and to await a substantive
report of the Waitangi Tribunal (the Tribunal in an interim report dated 1 April 1993 had
recommended the transfer not proceed until a substantive claim to the rivers had been heard).
It
was also alleged that common law aboriginal title rights had been interfered with under te
Electricity Act 1968 in giving consent for and in the construction of the dams.  
<P>
Held: Interim relief should not be granted. The Crown has only limited powers over electric
power boards and authorities, which in general are not agents of the Crown. While an ability
exists under the Electric Power Boards Act 1925 to compulsorily purchase electric works, in
light of the nature of Maori customary title, Treaty rights and the history of electricity
generation
in NZ, this is not a realistic prospect.
<P>
Aboriginal title, locally  Maori customary title , consists of rights over land and water enjoyed
by indigenous inhabitants prior to colonisation. If extinguished by less than fair conduct or
terms,
there is likely to be a breach of a fiduciary duty falling on the colonising power. Free consent
may yield sometimes by necessity to compulsory purchase for specific public purposes - but
proper compensation would be paid.Even on the most liberal construction, Maori customary
title
and Treaty rights were never conceived as including a right to generate electricity from water.
It
was not argued in this case that the dams were taonga. Specific Maori interests are mentioned
in
debates on the Water-power Act 1903, but there was no recognition of any general customary
rights to electricity generation. Consequently Maori interests would not be affected by a
transfer
to energy companies of the dams and other undertakings. Redress for Maori for other rights
which might have been affected cannot realistically lie in modifications to the ownership of the
power generating assets serving wider communities - despite a Waitangi Tribunal suggestion
to
the contrary in its interim report.
<P>
There may be valid claims about interference with fishing rights or more fundamentally,
control
of the river itself. But a practical remedy for such claims would lie before the Tribunal or
through negotiations, there being no substantial prospect of relief affecting the ownership of
the
dams.
<P>
Regarding claims about rights to river control, the Maori Affairs Act 1953, s155, is not clear
whether the bar on raising customary title against the Crown extends to water. The Waitangi
Tribunal in 2 reports (<EM>Te Ika Whenua - Energy Assets</EM> and <EM>Mohaka
River</EM> reports) has viewed rivers as taonga. This includes the concept that they are not
separable into constituent parts of bed, banks, and water. It is odd that, in the Wanganui River
litigation (<EM>In Re the Bed of the Wanganui River</EM> [1962] NZLR 600), it was not
argued that this concept survived the passing of the Coal-mines Act Amendment 1903 (vesting
beds of navigable rivers in the Crown). This is perhaps because of the emphasis placed in
counsel s argument at that time on the river bed and banks rather than the flow of water -
perhaps an instance where aboriginal title was rendered into strictly English law concepts, an
approach to be guarded against (Privy Council judgment in <EM>Amodu Tijani</EM> [1921]
2 AC 399 referred to). Similarly, the ad medium filum aquae rule is inconsistent with this
concept (Waitangi Tribunal <EM>Mohaka River</EM> report rejecting that approach for the
Mohaka river referred to), and may be  unreliable in determining what Maori have agreed to
part with . 
<P>
Concluding comments;  the Treaty of Waitangi has been acquiring some permeating influence
in
New Zealand  and  Treaty rights and Maori customary rights tend to be partly the same in
content .
<P>
[ed: this judgment provides the latest and most succinct summary of the application of
common
law aboriginal title in NZ, placing it firmly alongside the developing Canadian and Australian
jurisprudence and confirming the Court of Appeal approach in earlier cases in this area,
reading
aboriginal title and Treaty rights together. Comments about fiduciary duty perhaps extend that
aspect slightly. 
<P>
In finding that aboriginal rights do not include a right to generate electricity from water the
Court did not mention the  right to development  which has been upheld by the Waitangi
Tribunal in relation to fisheries (<EM>Muriwhenua Fishing</EM> and <EM>Ngai Tahu Sea
Fisheries</EM> reports). But in those reports the Tribunal was concerned with a resource
about
which there was some knowledge already in 1840. Lack of knowledge at 1840 seems to have
been central to the Court decision here (but see the argument in the Waitangi Tribunal
<EM>Radio Frequencies</EM> report, suggesting Maori may still have a Treaty interest in a
resource unknown in 1840, but central to cultural survival now). 
<P>
The judgment contains a strong hint that the Court might, given the opportunity, revisit its
precedent setting decision in 1962 that the bed of the Wanganui river was lost by Maori when
they sold land along the banks. The Waitangi Tribunal has already rejected the application of
that approach to the Mohaka river. It will hear the Wanganui river claim commencing March
1994.]

 - the Treaty claims area is generally poorly resourced<BR>

<H2><HR>The End of the Recession?</H2>
At first glance the report of the Waitangi Tribunal this month on electoral reform does not
appear
groundbreaking. Maori groups complained that the money so far spent on advertising of the
Maori
electoral option was inadequate to fully inform Maori voters of their options. The tribunal, as
might
have been expected, found that electoral rights are protected by the Treaty (article 3 in
particular
which talks of the rights and privileges of British subjects) so this was a legitimate matter for
the
application of Treaty principles. The tribunal then considered the funding provided to date and
concluded that more was required, without naming a specific figure.
<P>
What makes the report interesting is the debate surrounding the scope of the tribunal inquiry,
and
the effect of the Privy Council comments from the <EM>Broadcasting Assets</EM> case of
last
December (see Review Jan 1994). The Privy Council said that: "[W]hile the obligation of the
Crown [to protect taonga] is constant, the protective steps which it is reasonable for the
Crown
to
take change depending on the situation which exists at any particular time. For example, in
times
of recession the Crown may be regarded as acting reasonably in not becoming involved in
heavy
expenditure in order to fulfil its obligations although this would not be acceptable at a time
when
the economy was buoyant." It is this statement which the Crown seized on in submissions to
the
tribunal, warning it to be cautious when assessing the Crown's funding efforts to date. The
argument
proved to be a double edged sword. The tribunal independently entered in evidence a recent
Prime
Ministerial "state of the nation" address discussing the end of the recession, and effectively
dismissed
that part of counsel's argument. The government obviously disagrees with the tribunal
conclusion.
It turned down the tribunal recommendation that more money go into the electoral process,
citing
limited funding and other more urgent priorities.
<P>
So is the recession over or not? And what might this mean for claim settlements and the sum
currently being debated to go into the "fiscal envelope"? Will that sum be a recessionary one,
or one
reflecting the coming boom the Prime Minister is talking about?
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
No cases this month.
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Maori Electoral Option Report</H3>
<EM>Wai 413, 10 February 1994, Orr (Presiding Officer), Corban, Sorrenson, Temara,
Walker,
Young. 46 pp</EM><P>
This was an urgent hearing and report to consider 1) whether funding promoting the "Maori
electoral option" (MEO) is adequate, and 2) whether Maori agencies independent of
government
should undertake the promotion.
<P>
For two months from 15 February 1994 Maori electors will decide whether to register on the
Maori
or General roll. The numbers registering on the Maori roll will affect the number of Maori
constituency seats under the MMP system. The claimants, supported by major iwi and Maori
organisations, alleged that funding to promote the MEO was inadequate, and that any
promotion
should be organised through national Maori organisations.
<P>
Found: this was an issue to which the Treaty obviously applied. Article 2 guarantees tino
rangatiratanga, a term whose meaning is not fully captured by "English constitutional" ideas
such
as sovereignty, self-determination and self-management, and "a term that is eminently
adaptable to
time and circumstance". Approached broadly, the Treaty suggests tino rangatiratanga, like
kawanatanga, is not unfettered - the two concepts must be reconciled. Maori are entitled to a
measure of autonomy, but not full independence outside the nation state. This "qualified
autonomy"
can include separate parliamentary representation. The right to vote is also a matter coming
under
article 3 (rights and privileges of British subjects). 
<P>
Maori were deemed disqualified from voting through property restrictions (Maori land being
owned
communally) until the Maori Representation Act 1867, which provided for an adult male
franchise,
free of property qualifications (some years before this was allowed to Pakeha) and established
the
4 Maori seats. The secret ballot was not applied to the Maori seats until 1937. From 1967
Maori
were allowed to stand in European electorates (and vice versa). The Electoral Amendment Act
1975
briefly provided for the possibility that the number of Maori seats might reflect the numbers on
the
Maori roll (thus the present Maori option in essence revives the 1975 situation). Maori have
come
to see the 4 seats as a important symbolically, as a surviving expression of their constitutional
position under the Treaty. The 1986 Royal Commission on the Electoral System proposed
abolishing the seats under an MMP system, but Maori lobbying in 1993 saw them retained in
the
Electoral Act of that year, giving rise to the present option.
<P>
Recent comments of the Privy Council on the nature of the Treaty relationship (<EM>NZ
Maori
Council v A-G</EM> (broadcasting assets) PC 14/93, 13 December 1993) confirm the
conclusion
that the Crown has an obligation to protect Maori rights to political representation by taking
reasonable action in the prevailing circumstances. Whether the provisions of the Electoral Act,
which potentially enhance rangatiratanga, might be considered in themselves as a taonga
worthy of
protection was not argued, but might have been.
<P>
The Crown has made efforts in the past to enhance Maori participation in electoral reform by
advertising and face to face or "kanohi ki te kanohi" campaigns. Prior to the MEO, $904,341
was
spent informing Maori of general reforms, $652,063 has been set aside for the forthcoming
MEO
exercise (most of this, $431,000, to be spent on mailouts). However, limited regard should be
had
to past expenditure since its focus was not specifically the MEO. Significant numbers of Maori
are
still not enroled as electors (potentially up to 60,000). There is evidence of the need, in
addition
to
mailouts, for separate funding for kanohi ki te kanohi and mass media campaigns (particularly
television). 
<P>
While the recent Privy Council judgment suggests that the level of resources provided by the
Crown
to protect taonga must necessarily be constrained in a recession, this must be set against other
comments in that judgment that "especially vigorous action" is needed in some cases. This is
such
a case, where highly prized rights of a fundamental constitutional importance are involved. As
to
economic circumstances, the Prime Minister in a recent speech has stated that an economic
recovery
is underway and that Maori issues are a special focus for government.
<P>
The present funding provided is "substantially less" than is required for Maori to effectively
exercise
the MEO. As a matter of urgency funding should be increased to ensure maximum enrolment
of
Maori and adequate information on the MEO. 
<P>
Consultation should be undertaken with representatives of the National Maori Congress, NZ
Maori
Council and Maori Women's Welfare League to settle the programme and funding required
(no
specific figure named, but several estimates examined suggested around $1 million would be
required, inclusive of mailouts). 
<P>
Funding levels should be considered against the $47 million spent in this election cycle on
maintenance of the electoral rolls.  
It would be "consistent with tino rangatiratanga', for responsibility for the implementation of
any
campaign to be vested in the Maori representatives of the 3 pan-Maori organisations.
<P>
[ed: this report provides the first detailed consideration of the Privy Council judgment of last
December. The statements about rangatiratanga show that that concept still has room to
develop.
The Government has since announced it is rejecting the tribunal recommendation, citing other
spending priorities. This was the first hearing and report for several tribunal members - namely
Corban, Temara and Walker].
<P>
<H3>Chatham Islands claims</H3>
<EM>Wai 65 and others, 22 February 1994, CJ Durie</EM><P>
At a conference to consider progress with these claims counsel for Nga Iwi o Wharekauri
Rekohu
advised they were contemplating High Court action regarding jurisdictional issues eg whether
the
tribunal can depart from historic MLC decisions on customary entitlement, whether the MLC
should
be the place to decide issues of customary status. The tribunal noted that special jurisdiction
for
the
MLC under s27/1993 could possibly be sought; s30/1993 is not relevant since it refers to
finding
the appropriate representatives of customary groups, not determining which customary groups
are
entitled; and voiced its own view that it should proceed with a broad inquiry as this may clarify
any
jurisdictional questions requiring answer. "An important objective of the Treaty of Waitangi
Act
1975 is that long outstanding grievances should have a forum, that the Tribunal should
provide
a
forum, and that a comprehensive report, as appropriate to a commission of inquiry, should
provide
public awareness of the concerns. It must be borne in mind that the Moriori grievance has
been
the
subject of petitions from last century but, it would appear, the Moriori people have
consistently
lacked the benefit of an impartial examination of their concerns, unhindered by technicalities."
Hearing date set for 9 May 1994, in the Chatham Islands.
<P>
[ed: this will be an important hearing, raising questions about the "1840 rule" applied by the
Maori
Land Court to determine customary ownership]
<P>
<H2><HR>Other Jurisdictions</H2>
<H3>Glass Murray v Frank Alexander Geddes</H3>
<EM>High Court Whangarei M 93/93, Thorp J, 6 December 1993</EM><P>
This was an application by Mr Murray on behalf of Ngati-haua hapu that a caveat over the
property
of Mr Geddes under the Land Transfer Act 1952 not lapse. Murray claimed to be a beneficiary
under a trust, with Mr Geddes as trustee. No details of the trust were given or how it arose. It
was
claimed that either a trust arises with a hapu whenever an individual member of a hapu takes
an
individual title in the hapu land (on a subsequent transfer of the land any new owner with
knowledge
of the trust would be bound by it). Alternatively, a constructive trust had been created with
this
particular land owner since individualisation with the particular persons in the hapu who had
transferred the land to him.
<P>
Held: the onus is on the caveator to show an arguable case or a serious question to be tried.
The first
trust proposed was "revolutionary". There was no authority for it and it was difficult to see
how
the
courts would enforce it. The second trust failed for lack of evidence - none was presented. In
addition, inadequate notice had been given to the landowner of the reasons for lodging the
caveat
(ie general explanations were not adequate).
<P>
[ed: this case concerned the disputed land at Whangape claimed by Ngati-haua hapu. It is a
good
illustration of the difficulties (detailed research; difficult legal argument about trust law) which
claimant groups may face if they use this particular avenue to prevent sales of land under
claim].
<P>
<H3>Sea-Tow Ltd & L P Haddon and GR Brown & others v Auckland Regional Council &
another</H3>
<EM>A 129/93, Sheppard J, 14 December 1993</EM><P>
5 applications for coastal permits to extract sand from Mangawhai-Pakiri were recommended
for
approval by the Minister of Conservation by the Auckland Regional and Northland Regional
Councils. The sand would mainly be used in ready-mix concrete for building purposes in the
Auckland region. All parties except Haddon and Brown representing Ngatiwai interests had
agreed
to extraction for a 10 year period, and a full review after a technical study was completed on
long
term sustainable sand extraction. The study would have supervision from tangata whenua
among
others; they would also assist in drawing terms of reference for it. The other parties
acknowledged
that tangata whenua concerns had not been fully met but had been answered as far as was
possible
under the RMA. Ngatiwai claimed they had never given up ownership of the sands, had mana
over
them and were kaitiaki of them and had a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal. They sought
modifications to the permits in light of those claims.
<P>
Recommended: that the Minister should approve the permits with modifications but not those
sought
by Ngatiwai. Arguments about ownership of resources or past historical grievances are not
matters
to be addressed under the RMA. Ngatiwai would be actively protected by the safeguards
proposed.
There is no legal authority to delegate powers to Ngatiwai to manage the resource. The RMA
provides ample opportunities for participation by Maori in the planning process. These have
been
taken up here. The applications should not be deferred pending any Waitangi Tribunal
investigation
- the duty to take into account the Treaty does not require giving effect to it a if it were a law
applying to everyone, therefore it is not necessarily required to delay every application until a
Waitangi Tribunal report (it was also unlikely there would be a tribunal report in the near
future).
Inclusion of a representative on the working party for the sand study recognised the kaitiaki
role.
Potentially Ngatiwai could be involved in inspections to ensure compliance, if the regional
council
choose to transfer such functions under s33 RMA. No "Maori share" in the form of royalties
or other
benefits from sand extraction could be provided for within the RMA, this could be achieved by
Ngatiwai themselves obtaining a permit to take sand, or by a political decision to give a
royalty.
<P>
[ed: once again the limits of the RMA to address deeper issues is made clear. As was apparent
from
the objections raised, the role of kaitiaki of the resource implies control and responsibilities to
the
immediate group and the wider community eg "they would also want to explain to sand
extractors
the history and spirituality of the sand to the tangata whenua as part of their inheritance and
way of
life". A consultative role, no matter how intense, will always fall short of these sort of
aspirations].

<H3>Save the Chelsea Playground Committee v Wellington City Council & Te Motukairangi
Kohanga Reo</H3>
<EM>W 10/94, Kenderdine J, 18 February 1994</EM><P>
The Council had granted to the applicants a land use consent to construct a pre-school facility
for
25 children on a Council reserve. The appellants raised several grounds including "undue
weight"
given to Treaty of Waitangi issues in the Council decision.
<P>
Held: section 8 of the RMA is a relevant consideration. It was appropriate for the Council to
see the
proposal as fulfilling an obligation to protect Maori culture and reflecting concern that Maori
were
the lowest users of Council facilities. The proposal was not promoted by Council "at any
cost".
<P>
[ed: A largely unexceptional decision apart from the odd nature of some of the objections
raised by
the appellant committee. For eg noise from the 25 children, effect on painters at the nearby art
club
and, "the implications of Te Kohanga Reo as providing a focus for the Maori community of
Miramar, [being] at odds with those already utilising the current facilities at the site" - namely
the
local art club and community centre. The tribunal pointed out that the kohanga reo would be
open
to both Maori and Pakeha children of Miramar and would benefit the wider community].
<P>
<H3>Ngatiwai Trust Board v Whangarei District Council & Another</H3>
<EM>A 7/94, Bollard J, 11 February 1994</EM><P>
Ngatiwai Trust Board appealed against approval for a camping ground development including
sewage disposal. The appeal raised a waahi tapu issue not referred to in original submissions
to
the
Council which granted the approval. The area was also under a claim before the Waitangi
Tribunal
<P>
Held: The RMA does not intend that in all cases where Maori reside in the vicinity of a
development, or have registered a concern, they must be actively consulted with by a council
before
a matter is heard (although the council planning officer may be under a duty in suitable
circumstances to consult to provide a comprehensive planning report). Long standing cultural
issues
of which councils are aware are a different matter (<EM>Gill</EM> 2 NZRMA 605 and
<EM>Haddon</EM> Unrep A77/93 distinguished). 
<P>
In approaching s8, first the obligations and responsibilities of the Treaty outlined in well know
cases
of high authority are to be considered to determine if a Treaty matter arises in the exercise of
the
function, then if such a matter does arise relevant principles are to be taken into account to
ensure
the intent of the Treaty is maintained as far as practicable having regard to the purpose of the
Act
under s5.
<P>
Subject to general notification requirements (persons directly affected by application to be
notified,
s93(1)(e)), in this case no duty to consult was required before hearing. Persons objecting also
have
a responsibility to clearly express their concerns (no mention of waahi tapu in original
objections
in this case). The Trust Board, despite any reservations it might have had should have raised
the
waahi tapu issue in formal submissions. This failure had to be regarded in weighing the overall
background to the case. Whether or not the camping ground proposal proceeded would not
affect
the merits of a claim to the Waitangi Tribunal. A requirement that the sewage disposal system
be
relocated to adjoining land would recognise waahi tapu concerns.
<P>
[ed: this case contains thoughtful consideration of the requirements of section 8 and
consultation
provisions of the RMA. The tribunal noted that it was possible that at the council hearing of
the
application waahi tapu may have been mentioned by kaumatua. The implication being that this
reference was missed, perhaps because there were no interpreters present. It is often the case
that
sensitive issues or historical points about an area are spoken of in Maori. If essential
information is
not finding its way into formal submissions, there is perhaps a need to consider strategies to
sensitively draw out such matters, either at hearings or in the consultative or planning report
phase]
<P>
<H2><HR>General</H2>
<H3>Greenprint. Brief to the Incoming Government. </H3>
<EM>Department of Conservation, November 1993</EM><P>
There are 48 known claims which include land in the conservation estate, with the possibility
of
others. Two papers are being developed with other departments on policy principles
concerning
claims to natural resources and those to the conservation estate. Specific issues facing the
department
include cultural harvest (permits to use protected species); mahinga kai (potential of iwi to
manage
some food gathering areas). Also the Ngai Tahu claim (tribunal recommendations for the
return of
conservation areas in Arahua Valley, Waihora (Lake Ellesmere), Crown Titi Islands, part
Kaitorete
Spit, and a management interest in Whenua Hou (Codfish Island), and assessment of
conservation
values of Greenstone, Elfin Bay and Routeburn Stations "landbanked" for return). Also
conservation
lands connected with the Tainui claim, and Takapourewa (Stephens Island) claims.
<P>
The "ownership debate" is diverting attention from efforts to develop a "conservation
partnership"
between the Crown and Maori which recognises Crown conservation responsibilities while
acknowledging real grievances. Maori will not necessarily be equal managers but will equally
participate in determining "what is an appropriate level of shared management" for particular
situations. Notes difference in approaches - Maori ethic is for sustainable management across
the
entire resource; Pakeha seek protection of some areas (public conservation lands), sustainable
management for others.

Unrep 1993 CA 124/93, come close. The NZ Court of Appeal may lean towards recognition
also
of a fiduciary duty, where the majority rejected this in Australia. However the Treaty of
Waitangi
Act and references to the Treaty in NZ statutes has allowed progress with little need for NZ
courts
to use the aboriginal title doctrine.
<P>
Concerning Maori land, "there is a strong case in New Zealand for a return to tribal body
corporate
ownership of all multiply owned land with some safeguards to protect existing successful
trusts
and
incorporations. The cost of maintaining the separate Maori land recording system is high and
its
security is also presently suspect as government shows some fiscal reluctance to move into
more
secure data processing and recording." The NZ government is working on a fiscal envelope
for
claim
settlements. The time is opportune to restructure Maori organisations to cope with the
dynamics of
change following Treaty settlements. Existing Maori bodies overlap, leading to a waste of
resources,
particularly leadership. There may be a preponderance of policy making bodies without
operational
arms; eg Te Puni Kokiri. A Maori Commission may provide an answer.
<P>
<H3>The Fiscal Envelope</H3>
<EM>From the same speech</EM><P>
"The NZ government has set itself a target date of 2000 to complete the hearing process and is
also
working on a fiscal "envelope" or settlement fund which represents the total sum the New
Zealand
government proposes to apply in settlement of all claims. It is to be gathered and set aside
over
a
period of 10 years and used to make cash payments or buy land from the State Departments or
State
owned enterprises for settlement of claims. The amount in the envelope is to be a government
assessment of what it can or should pay after it has assessed its obligations. It is in no way
related
to actual loss suffered by Maori."
<P>
[ed: as this address suggests, policy on the size and details of the fiscal envelope is well
advanced.
Discussions have been held with some Maori leaders]
<P>
<H3>Post Election Briefing for the Minister for the Environment</H3>
<EM>Ministry for the Environment, November 1993</EM><P>
A government overview policy on Treaty claims would help secure equity and consistency, not
only
between claims but also for government policy reflected in legislation like the RMA. The
Ministry
is working to advance such an overview policy, but lacks resources to give time to all specific
claim
issues, or assist in developing resource management options leading to durable settlements.
The
Ministry is examining the "exchange of rights" inherent in the Treaty to work towards
solutions
meeting environment objectives of government and Maori, recognising that Maori are not only
guardians of certain resources but potential developers also.

<H2><HR>Consultation and Resource Management</H2>
Several decisions have now been made by the Planning Tribunal concerning consultation with
Maori
under the Resource Management Act 1991. They suggest the Act is not as clear on this
subject
as
it might be. In the most recent decision, <EM>Hanton & Ors v The Auckland City Council &
BP
Oil NZ Ltd</EM> (A10/94, 1 March 1994, reviewed below) Judge Sheppard held that, for
councils, there was no obligation to consult with Maori interests before hearing a resource
consent
application. His reasoning, in part, was that a council, not being the Crown, could not take on
the
Treaty duty of consultation which had been spelt out for the Crown by the Court of Appeal.
Also,
a council would fail to act judicially as the RMA intended if it consulted with one section of
the
community prior to a hearing. Judge Sheppard did not rule out consultation in special cases,
although it is hard to see how the argument of fairness would not apply in every case.
<P>
In an earlier decision, <EM>Gill v Rotorua District Council</EM> ((1993) 2 NZRMA 604)
the
tribunal ruled that consultation may occur. Judge Kenderdine stated that the council in that
case
by
doing no more than passing on information had not satisfied its duties to Maori under the
RMA. No
distinction was made between Crown and council obligations. It was assumed that Crown
obligations of consultation were now laid on councils by the Act. The duty under the Act,
Judge
Kenderdine said, is a high one, requiring special regard to be had to Maori interests. The Act
itself
imposes a "duty to be on enquiry" on councils. Judge Sheppard, distinguished this decision on
the
ground that a "special background of Maori significance" existed which the council could not
have
been unaware of. In doing this he followed a decision in <EM>Ngatiwai Trust Board v
Whangarei
District Council & Ors</EM> (A7/94, reviewed in the previous issue)). But again, if a council
would be acting unfairly to consult just one section of the community, is this distinction valid?
Judge
Kenderdine did not consider a further point raised in <EM>Ngatiwai</EM> and
<EM>Hanton</EM>, that the RMA provides specifically for consultation with Maori in some
contexts (eg the making of policies and plans), but not in decisions over resource consents. Is
this
because Parliament foresaw precisely the concern about fairness now raised? Perhaps the
bigger
issue however, is how far the RMA intended for Maori to be given a special status in resource
management. Further decisions will be awaited with interest.
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>In re Kotene Pihema</H3>
<EM>53 Tauranga MB 105, 18 February 1994, Carter J</EM><P>
The applicant bought a hayshed and had it relocated onto land under a s438/1953 trust of
which he
was chairman. The relocation was at the cost of the trust. It was used for a training
programme.
He
sought an order under s18(1)(a)/1993 determining ownership.
<P>
Held: the building was a fixture to land (the intention was that it remain on the land).
Consequently
legal ownership was with the shareholders in the land. Section 18(1)(a) allows consideration
of
equities. The court considers matters such as evidence of exclusive occupation of a building,
consultation with other owners, acceptance by other owners that a building belongs to the
applicant.
Court jurisdiction could be said to flow from tikanga Maori where families built homes on
tribal
lands. <EM>In Re Tikouma No 5 Block</EM> (92 Hauraki MB 1) was considered (where
lessees
who were major owners in a block were held not to have ownership of buildings erected and
exclusively used by them). No evidence suggested any equitable ownership remained in the
applicant in this case (the trust and not the applicant paid the relocation costs, there had been
no
consultation with trustees, a conflict of interest would exist if ownership of the building
remained
in the chairperson after his unilateral decision to use trust money to relocate it).
<P>
<H3>The Maori Land Court Rules 1994</H3>
<EM>SR 1994/35, effective from 18 March 1994</EM><P>
The new rules attempt to comprehensively codify Maori Land Court practice (as was
envisaged
by
s95/1993 which replaced the much briefer s25/1953). For example, Part III dealing with
Notification of Applications sets out in 19 detailed clauses the procedure for drawing up the
Panui
(the old rules dealt with notification in one clause). Similarly, Part V details the Disposal of
Proceedings over 13 clauses. A new Part XIX is added concerning the making and
maintenance of
the records of the court. 
<P>
Other features include details of the powers of the registrar to conduct uncontested cases and
inquire
and report on proceedings generally where the court refers them (clauses 46-51 and 87).
Particulars
of applications to form each of the 5 new types of trusts are included under Part XIII. Clause
15
provides that applications may be in the Maori language. Of particular interest are the rules
dealing
with the preferred classes of alienees who must be given first right of refusal to proposed
alienations
of Maori freehold land. The rules provide for potential members of the class to be notified by a
combination of newspaper notices, personal service and any other directions of the court
(clauses
112 and 117). The new rules replace the rules of 1958/162 and amendments.
<P>
<H3>Regulations under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993</H3>
<EM>Hon J Luxton reply to Hon K T Wetere, Replies Supplement 22 March
1994</EM><P>
There are 5 sets of regulations required for Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993:<P>
- Fees Regulations came into force prior to 1 July 1993<BR>
- Maori Incorporation Regulations will be finalised before the end of March 1994<BR>
- Maori Reservation Regulations have been drafted and remain to be finalised<BR>
- Powers of Assembled Owners Regulations; draft awaited from Parliamentary Counsel
Office<BR>
- Maori Occupational Orders Regulations; draft awaited from Parliamentary Counsel Office
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Whanganui River Claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 167, A77. Opening Submissions of Counsel for Claimants, S Elias QC, 18 March
1994</EM><P>
Under "preliminary issues which need resolution", counsel challenged the view put forward by
the
Crown that the tribunal may only examine actions or policies of the Crown and consequently:
<P>
- has no function to determine whether the common law is in accordance with the principles of
the
Treaty (in this claim the issue being the application of the ad medium filum rule to the
Whanganui
river);<BR>
- has no jurisdiction to make recommendations in relation to the actions of a regional council
(the
issue here being a proposed regional plan affecting the river).
<P>
It was argued that these views are wrong in law (despite earlier tribunal reports stating that
courts
and local authorities do not act "by or on behalf of the Crown"). The focus should not be on
the body
of law discussing the liability of the Crown, but rather on the transfer of the whole bundle of
sovereign rights under the Treaty of which the power to do justice is a significant part. The
status
of local authorities as delegates is clear in the legislation under which they operate. The
tribunal
has
a distinct function and does not review the courts, but rather applies a Treaty test as opposed
to
a
legal one. It should not therefore defer to bodies exercising entirely different functions. It
would be
absurd to think that it had power to review legislation, to which common law is subordinate,
but no
power to review common law itself. The tribunal was invited to state a case to the High Court
if it
had any doubts on these points.
<P>
<H3>Waikura lands claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 422, 28 February 1994, CJ Durie</EM><P>
Privately-owned land which was central to the area under claim had come up for sale. The
claimants
had raised funds to purchase the land, but sought an urgent hearing and recommendation to
have
the Crown assist in the completion of the purchase. The tribunal was unable to give the matter
urgency but suggested to the Minister of Maori Affairs and Justice that the land might be
bought and
the Crown share held pending a final determination of the claim by hearing or negotiation. The
tribunal was aware of the sensitivities involved in the acquisition of private land for such
purposes,
but pointed out that there was international precedent for such private land purchases in the
buy-back scheme operating in New South Wales to re-establish the landholdings of
dispossessed
aboriginal groups.
<P>

<H2><HR>Other Jurisdictions</H2>
<H3>Wikeepa v Police</H3>
<EM>AP 62/93, HC Tauranga. 2 February 1994. Hillyer J</EM><P>
This was an appeal against convictions for resisting arrest and assaulting a constable on the
grounds
that the law prohibiting such actions did not bind the convicted because of the Treaty of
Waitangi.
In a brief oral judgment the appeals were dismissed, the court holding that it could not sustain
any
submission that the Treaty prevented citizens, Maori or Pakeha, from being subject to the law.
<P>
<H3>JJ Hanton & Ors v The Auckland City Council & BP Oil NZ Ltd</H3>
<EM>A10/94, 1 March 1994, Sheppard J</EM><P>
This was an appeal against a consent to build a service station, to be located on former
Auckland
Area Health Board land. Ngati Whatua o Orakei Trust Board (owning adjacent land) raised
several
objections including the effect of the proposal on the heritage value of the land and Maori
links
with
their ancestral land, and that the land was regarded as part of the public estate.
<P>
Held: there was no evidence of any "particular relationship" of Maori to the site, or of any
effect of
the proposal on heritage values or Maori links to ancestral land. As to claims to the Waitangi
Tribunal in the area, they are general, were lodged after the land was sold by the Area Health
Board,
had not been heard or reported on by the tribunal, and the land is subject to the section
preventing
the tribunal from recommending the purchase of private land by the Crown. The private status
of
the land at the time the application for a consent was lodged, the fact the council knew of no
waahi
tapu or archaeological features on the site, nor any special effect on adjacent land meant there
was
no duty on the city council to separately notify the trust board.
<P>
Further, there is no obligation on a consent authority to consult Maori over a resource consent
application:
<P>
- s8 requires consent authorities to take into account the principles of the Treaty, but not
themselves
to be subject to obligations which fall on the Crown (where the consent authority is the Crown
the
situation is different eg <EM>Haddon</EM> case);<BR>
- consent authorities are not deciding on the disposal of Crown assets in a manner which might
affect
the resolution of Treaty claims. Court of Appeal comments on Treaty principles are therefore
not
directly applicable ;<BR>
- the RMA provides a detailed code in which Maori are included (eg Maori must be consulted
about
policies and plans), but omits any express duty of consultation for consent applications;<BR>
- consent authorities would fail to act judicially by consulting with one particular community
interest
prior to public hearings.
<P>
Tribunal decisions in <EM>Gill v Rotorua District Council</EM> ((1993) 2 NZRMA 604)
and
<EM>Haddon v Auckland Regional Council</EM> (A77/93, 11 August 1993) were
distinguished,
and the reasoning in <EM>Ngatiwai Trust Board</EM> (A7/94, 11 February 1994, see
February
issue) adopted. 
<P>
[ed: on the basis of this decision, the position when considering Maori interests in resource
consents
now seems to be as follows: If the Crown is the consent authority, there is usually a duty of
consultation (<EM>Haddon</EM> and <EM>Hanton</EM>). In other cases, there is no
obligation
to consult. Council planning officers in preparing reports on applications should carefully
consider
if there are Maori interests (<EM>Ngatiwai</EM>). Something more than a general Maori
interest
in the land affected must be evident (<EM>Ngatiwai</EM> and <EM>Hanton</EM>). All
consent
authorities likewise should carefully consider if there are Maori interests when requiring
information
or further information to make decisions and in deciding who to notify
(<EM>Ngatiwai</EM>).
Consent authorities in finally deciding on an application must have regard to any Maori
interests
(<EM>Ngatiwai</EM>). Claims by Maori to the ownership of resources are not issues
planning
authorities can consider under the RMA (<EM>Haddon</EM>).]
<P>
<H2><HR>General</H2>
<H3>Press Statement from Minister of Fisheries</H3>
<EM>3 March 1993</EM><P>
Regulation 27 of the Fisheries (Amateur Fishing) Regulations will be repealed and replaced
with
comprehensive Maori traditional fishing regulations. The current regulation was always
intended
as an interim measure until more detailed regulations were passed. Over 120 submissions have
been
received on proposed new regulations with equal numbers from Maori and non-Maori. The
new
regulations are expected to be in place by the middle of the year.
<P>
[ed: Presently under regulation 27, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) has
approved
generally takings for hui or tangi held on a marae. Kaumatua approval is all that is required,
and
a written report on what is taken must be supplied to the nearest MAF office within 2 weeks
of
the
taking. However for takings for hui or tangi at venues other than marae, and for traditional
non-commercial purposes other than hui or tangi, only kaumatua or Maori authorities
nominated
by Maori and approved by the Director-General of MAF can give approval. A written report is
again
required. Special conditions exist for rock lobster (MAF letter of 3 November 1993).
<P>
The more comprehensive regulations under discussion would provide a regular system of
appointment of kaitiaki and spell out their powers, probably including the power to make
bylaws
to manage non-commercial fisheries. They would also provide for the establishment of
mataitai
reserves.(<EM>Discussion document</EM>, Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission)]
<P>
<H3>Report and Recommendations of the Board of Inquiry into the NZ Coastal Policy
Statement</H3>
<EM>Department of Conservation, 14 February 1994</EM><P>
This was a report required under the RMA where the Minister has proposed a NZ coastal
policy
statement (NZCPS). The board heard and received public submissions on the proposed
statement.
Among the changes recommended:
<P>
- Kaitiakitanga is inadequately expressed in the English used in the RMA. This has serious
implications for the successful implementation of the NZCPS. While stressing that some terms
could
only be understood in Maori, a fuller definition in English of the concepts behind kaitiakitanga
was
provided;<BR>
- a principle of the plan should be that "the tangata whenua are the kaitiaki of the coastal
environment" (new clause 12);<BR>
- the protection of features of significance to Maori should be in accordance with tikanga
Maori
which may involve non-disclosure of locations (chapter 2);<BR>
- where special features are identified local authorities are to consider the transfer of
management
functions to iwi authorities and/or delegation to a committee of the local authority comprising
representatives of the tangata whenua (chapter 2);<BR>
- "papakainga housing" to be provided for "in appropriate places" and redefined to include all
types
of "residential occupancy on any ancestral land owned by Maori" (policy 3.2.7);<BR>
- the policy providing for the Minister to anticipate Treaty claim settlements by providing for
Maori
only uses in parts of regional coastal plans should be deleted as ultra vires the RMA (policy
4.1.1);<BR>
- the lack of funding for Maori for the regular consultation which the proposed statement
requires,
needs to be addressed;<BR>
- a set of working guidelines on Treaty issues should be drawn up for those exercising
functions and
powers under the RMA;<BR>
- a special Maori task force, separately funded, and comprising equal numbers of
Crown/Maori
appointees, should be established to oversee all Department of Conservation work in relation
to
Maori.
<P>
The view of the NZ Maori Council, that the proposed statement and the RMA did not provide
rangatiratanga as envisaged by the Treaty and that the consultation process should begin
anew,
was
noted. It was hoped that the proposed task force might address these concerns. Members of
the
Board
of Inquiry were Arnold Turner, Dr Margaret Mutu, Denis Nugent, Colin Mcnab, Maui
Solomon.
<P>
<H3>Maori Claims. How to Research and Write a Report</H3>
<EM>Jane Tucker. Waitangi Tribunal occasional publication 1/1994. 43pp</EM><P>
A guide to research for claims before the Waitangi Tribunal. It is a compilation of information
provided in a 13 day introductory course piloted in 1991. The booklet contains information on
research planning, finding sources, note taking and writing up a final report. Copies are
available
from the Waitangi Tribunal.
<P>
<H3>Extract from address of Hon JHB Bolger to Newspaper Publishers Association Annual
Conference</H3>
<EM>Blenheim, 16 March 1994</EM><P>
Let me answer the question raised by the Leader of the Labour Party - will a move to an
elected head
of state affect the obligations that flow from the Treaty of Waitangi.
My clear view is no. <BR>
The obligations that flow from the Treaty for all practical purposes have been and will be
given
effect by the elected Government - and that will continue. <BR>
I am pleased to see Dr Robert Mahuta the chief adviser to the Maori Queen taking a very
sensible
view of the matter by saying he has long expected such a move and suggesting that
"Progression
from a relationship with the Crown to a republic may be part of the process" of reconciling
past
wrongs.<BR>
On the question of having the final Court of Appeal in Wellington rather than in London we
must
first satisfy ourselves that the current appeal processes are adequate - or take steps to make
them
so.<BR>
That shouldn't take forever.<BR>
We really don't want issues relating to unique New Zealand cases - such as the Treaty of
Waitangi
- dealt with in a distant court.
<P>
<H3>Law Commission appointment</H3>
Waitangi Tribunal member Joanne Morris has been appointed to the Law Commission.
<P>
<H3>Te Ture Whenua Maori Amendment Bill</H3>
This bill was introduced into the House on 29 March 1994, given its first reading, and referred
to
the Maori Affairs select committee (more details will be provided next month).
<P>
<H3>Extract from Maiden Speech of Hon Tau Henare, MP Northern Maori</H3>
<EM>15 March 1994</EM><P>
Maori in the North have had to struggle with some bleak realities. .... <BR>
The reality of knowing that your forebears, a proud people of substance and energy, witnessed
the
gradual erosion of all their rights guaranteed by the Treaty as laws were enacted to asset strip
the
Maori people. In the Northern Maori Electorate examples of this are legendary.<BR>
The reality of listening to politicians telling New Zealand that they are preparing to settle
Treaty
Claims while Maori know that no serious attempt is being made to even identify what those
claims
actually are and what the cost has been to Maori.<BR>
The reality of knowing that Maori culture and heritage today is up for interpretation and
definition
by those administrators of the law who deal with such words in legislation as tangata whenua,
wahitapu, kaitiakitanga and taiapure. And that Maori have become passive as the outer world
bears
down to define and limit their culture, inherent in which lie the values that keep Maori strong.
....<BR>
The reality of being at the brunt end of the free market unprepared, unresourced and unable to
do
much about that in the short term except to exercise their vote.<BR>
And vote they did...
<P>
<H3>Dame Whina Cooper</H3>
Northern Maori elder Dame Whina Cooper died on 26 March 1994 aged 98. Haere, e Kui,

<H2><HR>Maori Electoral Rights</H2>
<P>
The February issue of the Review commented on the Waitangi Tribunal report on the electoral
option. Proceedings have now been issued seeking to judicially review the Crown's decision
not
to provide further funding. The writers have not viewed the statement of claim, but issues of
reasonableness and fiduciary obligations stand out as matters for consideration by the Court.
<P>
Both the Treaty principles and the Wednesbury principles may call into question the
reasonableness of the Crown's actions. On the Treaty based analysis, "vigorous action" should
have been taken by the Crown to protect Maori electoral rights. The Treaty approach is, in
this
context, limited by the lack of statutory incorporation of the Treaty. But, if recent judgments
are anything to go by - as Cooke P stated in <EM>Te Runanganui O Te Ika Whenua Inc
Society & Ors v A-G</EM> (CA 124/93) - "the Treaty of Waitangi has been acquiring some
permeating influence in New Zealand law ..."
<P>
The Wednesbury approach may yet provide the answer. Lord Bridge of Harwich in a case
concerning human rights (<EM>Regina v Brind</EM> [1991] 1 AC 696) suggested that
Wednesbury principles permit the courts to ask whether a decision maker could "reasonably"
decide that competing public interests justified a restriction on the right in question. Applying
that test here - has the Minister of Justice or the relevant decision maker justifiably limited the
funding in light of the fundamental constitutional right at risk?
<P>
Perhaps this is also a case where the Courts can rule on the fiduciary duty question. Maori
cession of sovereignty in exchange for kawanatanga, the historical failure to provide resources
to encourage electoral participation and the vulnerable position of Maori due to the Crown's
failure, arguably provide a basis for the "fiduciary" obligation to protect Maori
constitutional/electoral rights. Recent case law both here and overseas confirm that the
fiduciary duty exists.
We await the outcome of the judicial review application.

<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>New Deputy Chief Judge</H3>
From the 11 April 1994, Judge Norman Smith took up his appointment as the new Deputy
Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court. He replaces former Deputy Chief Judge Ashley
McHugh who retired on the 31 March 1994, after more than 6 years in that post. Judge Smith
has been a MLC judge in Rotorua (Waiariki District).
<P>
<H3>Case Stated re Pakiri R Block and Rahui Te Kuri Incorporation</H3>
<EM>Case Stated 1/93, 23 March 1993, Deputy Chief Judge McHugh, Smith,
Carter</EM><P>
The Maori Affairs Act 1953 s2(2)(f) provides that Maori freehold land, where it is transferred
otherwise than by MLC order, is deemed to be General land, unless the instrument of transfer
states on its face that the land remains Maori freehold land. Where it is not the intention that
the land become general land, a determination by the MLC may later be sought that the land
remains Maori land (s30(1)(i)). Section 233 provides that alienations of Maori freehold land
are to have no force or effect until the instrument of alienation is endorsed with a memorial
stating that the alienation has been noted in the records of the MLC.
<P>
These provisions reflect a legislative tension between the desire to prevent unwitting changes
to
the status of Maori land, while also providing certainty as to title to purchasers acting in good
faith. This case stated considered the effect of registration under the Land Transfer Act on
these sections. More strongly worded provisions in Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 were also
considered.
<P>
Held: s2(2)(f)/1953 means that upon registration of a transfer an irrebuttable presumption
applies that the land is general land irrespective of its true status. An order may be sought
subsequently under s30(1)(i)/1953 determining the land to be Maori land, but the consent of
the registered proprietor would be required before any such order was made. <EM>In Re
Kopua Deceased</EM> [1987] 15 Ruatoria MB 238 and <EM>In Re Haumingi 9B2A</EM>
[1984] 210 Rotorua MB 106 followed, <EM>In Re Otorohanga A4A</EM> [1984] 63
Waikato MB 246 dissented from. Section 130/1993 however, now provides that the status of
land is definitely not affected by registration.
<P>
Section 233(1)/1953 affects an alienation only until it is registered under the Land Transfer
Act, at which point an indefeasible title is gained. <EM>Housing Corporation of New Zealand
v Maori Trustee</EM> [1988] 2 NZLR 662 followed (where it was said that s233(1) was a
matter of "administrative convenience" and not of "deep legal or social importance"). <EM>In
Re Estate Mana Hunter</EM> (1993) 135 Napier MB 165 dissented from.
<P>
Section 126/1993 (District Land Registrar shall not register any instrument affecting Maori
land unless it has been confirmed) suggests that where a transfer is registered without
confirmation, s81 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 providing for correction of titles would be
used to correct the title. This would be so despite previous authority suggesting s81 is for slips
or minor errors in the record only.
<P>
[ed: a decision with important implications. Does the protection of Maori land through the
strongly worded mechanisms provided in Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 now stand as an
exception to the principle of indefeasibility? The High Court decision in the Housing
Corporation case was reluctantly followed. Their honours thought it "understandable" in light
of the Treaty guarantee of full exclusive and undisturbed possession to Maori of their lands,
and specific provisions protecting Maori title in the 1953 legislation, that judges of the MLC
should question whether they are required to follow the principle of indefeasibility. They also
noted that since the High Court decision "a feeling has arisen among some Judges that the
Land Transfer Office has adopted a somewhat cavalier attitude towards Maori land and the
protective mechanisms of the Maori Affairs Act 1953." Approval was expressed of procedures
being put in place by the Land Transfer Office to ensure compliance with the 1993 Act. If their
honours' views about the effect of the 1993 Act on indefeasibility are correct, such compliance
now assumes considerable importance]
<P>
<H3>The Maori Reservations Regulations 1994</H3>
<EM>SR 1994/57, commencing 23 May 1994</EM><P>
These revise the archaic regulations of 1963 which were concerned largely with health and
sobriety (eg trustees to prevent prolongation of hui or tangi which might become a menace to
health). The new regulations concentrate on administrative structures and procedures and
accountability. For marae reservations a separate charter governing the administration is to be
drawn up (cl7). A specific power is provided for trustees to employ advisors to assist with
administration (cl8(e)). In a small change to perhaps better reflect custom, tangi hanga are
specifically exempted from the requirement that prior written authorisation of the trustees is
required before major activities are held on the reservation (cl9(2)).
<P>
<H3>The Maori Incorporations Constitution Regulations 1994</H3>
<EM>SR 1994/60, commencing 1 June 1994</EM><P>
Revises the old regulations of 1969 to bring them into line with the 1993 Act. A notable
change
is cl27 under which shareholders by special resolution may fix a specified number of shares as
a "minimum share unit", and shareholders may not engage in transfers which would cut into
their minimum unit. Trading is forbidden in numbers of shares below the number set as the
minimum unit. The exception is where a transfer consists of all the transferor's shares and they
are offered to an existing shareholder or the incorporation or trustee on behalf of a putea or
whanau trust.
<P>
In keeping with the times, cl26 permits a "teleconference"  meeting of committees of
management. Described as "The contemporaneous linking together by telephone or other
means of instantaneous audio (or audio and visual) communication" of a quorum of the
committee, it includes overseas telephone links. All committee members entitled to be at the
meeting are entitled to a telephone or other link, and all present must be able to hear every
other member throughout the meeting.
<P>
These regulations revoke the Maori Incorporations Regulations 1969/49 and amendment
1976/108.
<P>
<H3>Te Ture Whenua Maori Amendment Bill 1994</H3>
<P>
This contains numerous "fine tuning" amendments, but also more substantial amendments
concerning some dealings with Maori land. Several clauses giving greater flexibility to the
operation of incorporations. Clause 14 clarifies the intention of the 1993 Act that corporations
may acquire land purely for investment purposes, in which case it is held by the incorporation
rather than the shareholders and may be dealt with as general land. Clause 16 provides that
incorporations may by special resolution make their own constitutions, subject to general
guidelines by regulation, rather than having the form absolutely prescribed by regulation. They
may also adjust their overall shareholding (cl17).
<P>
Leasehold interests in Maori freehold land under cross-leases are to be treated as a beneficial
interest in Maori freehold land (cl2 & 4). A certificate of title in respect of a cross lease may
be
issued (cl4). This is an exception to the rule that certificates may not issue for undivided
interests in Maori freehold land).
<P>
Matters where a certificate of confirmation from the Registrar only is required are to be
adjusted. The transfer or discharge of a mortgage now requires full confirmation, but
alienation
of a sublease and renewal of a sublease or licence are to be matters where only the Registrar's
confirmation is required.
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Ngati Motai lands claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 254, 31 March 1994, CJ Durie</EM><P>
Tribunal member John Kneebone has been appointed to mediate this claim concerning, inter
alia, an old meeting house site called Renga Renga. The appointment of a mediator is made
under clause 9A of the second schedule of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975. The mediator is
required to use his best efforts to effect a settlement, but if this is not possible, to report back
to
the tribunal on issues agreed and those unresolved. Other matters referred to a mediator have
included the Takaporewa (Stephens) Island claim (Wai 91), a claim to lands at Waitomo (Wai
51), and a claim over the Waikareao estuary roadway proposal in Tauranga (Wai 86).
<P>
<H2><HR>Other Jurisdictions</H2>
<H3>Cook Island Community (HB) Inc v Hastings District Council and T Kaui & G
Ruwhiu</H3>
<EM>W19/94, 31 March 1994, Treadwell J, with commissioners Bishop &
Rowan</EM><P>
Two Maori applicants sought to establish a funeral parlour business in a suburb with a large
Maori population, to cater in an appropriate way for mainly Maori funerals. This was an
appeal
against a decision by the council granting permission to construct the parlour opposite a Cook
Island community centre which had been in operation for 14 years. The major objection was
that Cook Island customs of respect of the dead would restrict activities (weddings, birthdays,
cabarets, sports, cultural nights etc) in the community centre whenever bodies were present in
the proposed parlour. For the Maori applicants it was argued that s6 (Maori relationship with
their ancestral lands a matter of national importance) and s8 (principles of the Treaty to be
taken into account in decisions) should be weighted against the objections of the appellants.
The application had support from local Maori organisations and one of the applicants was a
descendant of an original owner of the land in the area of the proposal.
<P>
Held: allowing the appeal, that Maori concerns did not take precedence in this case. Another
location could be used. It was further commented that any other decision would result in
"irreparable cultural divisiveness unacceptable in our multi-cultural society and contrary to the
thrust of the RM Act." Although the appellants had been uncompromising in their approach,
beliefs if sincerely held "are not capable of compromise."
<P>
<H2><HR>General</H2>
<H3>Naming of Maori Electorates</H3>
<EM>Replies Supplement 22 March 1994</EM><P>
The government is seeking legal advice whether there is power under the Electoral Act 1993
to
name the Maori electoral districts.
<P>
[ed: The 1993 Act provides at s40(1)(a) that for general electoral districts, a representation
commission, after due inquiry, is to report the names and boundaries of districts to the
Governor-General. For Maori electoral districts, the Act provides that boundaries only are to
be reported on (s45(9)(a).
<P>
Also of interest is the presence of the Chief Judge of the MLC on the independent Electoral
Commission, a body empowered to maintain the register of political parties, refusing
registration where a proposed party name is offensive or misleading. The Commission is also
to
promote public awareness of electoral matters and consider and report on any electoral issues
as it sees fit (see Electoral Act 1993 ss10A-E and Part IIA inserted by the Electoral
Amendment Act 1993). Other members of the Commission are the Secretary of Justice, and
the Hon Justice Wallace (President). The Commission will begin work as soon as its last
member is appointed. Arrangements are in train for this (see Replies Supplement 5 April
1994)]
<P>
<H3>The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</H3>
<P>
Concerns about the effect of the recent GATT agreement have been expressed in two main
areas; whether the power remains to intervene to ensure provision of services specifically for
Maori, and the patenting of important cultural items eg plants, medical practices, and even
DNA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade/Manatu Aorere (MoFAT) says NZ has made
no commitments under the GATT on these issues.
<P>
The two documents involved are the <EM>General Agreement on Trade in Services</EM>
(GATS) and the <EM>Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights</EM> (TRIPS).
<P>
GATS provides (article 1) that, with respect to sectors covered by the agreement, countries
may not discriminate against providers of private services from other countries (the
government
service sector is entirely excluded from the agreement). Sectors covered in NZ's case include
advertising, computers, real estate, services incidental to agriculture, hunting & forestry,
audio-visual, education, financial, transport, professional services (eg law, accounting).
Sectors
excluded include postal, environmental, health & social services, recreational & cultural
services, research & development.
<P>
There are two specific Maori exemptions in schedules to the agreement. NZ is generally
"Unbound for current and future measures ... according more favourable treatment to any
Maori person or organisation in relation to the acquisition, establishment or operation of any
commercial or industrial undertaking." Under "Audiovisual Services" and the heading
"Limitations on national treatment" it is noted that the Broadcasting Commission is required to
allocate a minimum of 6% of its budget to Maori programming, and that a Maori Broadcasting
Funding Agency (Te Reo Whakapuaki Irirangi) exists. Exemptions are subject to review after
5
years (article 2).
<P>
TRIPS provides that nationals of other countries are to receive the same treatment in respect
of
protection of intellectual property as nationals of NZ, and enjoy equal rights where new
advantages or immunities are granted to NZlanders (articles 3 & 4). Article 27 provides that
patents are to be made available for new inventions in all fields of technology, but members
may exclude from patentability "diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment
of humans or animals" and "plants and animals other than microorganisms, and essentially
biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and
microbiological processes". The exemption re plants and animals is to be reviewed 4 years
after
the agreement comes into force (subparagraphs (a) and (b)). Patentability may also be
excluded
where commercial exploitation would harm public order or morality. This includes the
protection of human, animal or plant life [therefore it presumably covers any DNA patenting].
<P>
Implementation of the agreements in NZ requires enactment. The Ministry of Commerce
hopes that legislation will be introduced to Parliament in July, coming into effect during 1995.
<P>
[ed: Government officials point to the flexibility the Crown in NZ retains in implementing any
GATT measures. They also stress that plenty of time is available to discuss any further
commitments by NZ which might directly raise Treaty related concerns. Those concerns are
increasing. The Waitangi Tribunal has before it a claim concerning, among other things, patent
rights over indigenous flora and fauna (Wai 262). The Plant Variety Rights Act 1987
providing
for patenting of hybrids is particularly objected to (TRIPS article 27 mentioned above
endorses
a regime for plant patents). The central issue of how far rights of indigenous groups can be
protected in a free market environment is illustrated by the visit this month of Body Shop
officials to Rotorua to investigate the possibility of using manuka oil in their product line. That
company adopts a consultative approach and seeks to create employment opportunities for
indigenous groups. Under GATT free market principles, could the NZ government legislate
for
such results, and avoid allegations of protectionism? Given the commitment to GATT, would
any NZ government have the will to legislate in this way?
<P>
There are also benefits of unfettered trade to consider. The agriculture, forestry and fishing
industries, which have many Maori participants, will all gain under the GATT. Sealord
Products Ltd, for example, has endorsed the latest agreement because of gains achieved for
fish exports (<EM>Trading Ahead</EM>, April 1994 p46)]
<P>
<H3>Mana Enterprises</H3>
<EM>NZ Gazette 1994 p1250</EM><P>
From 29 April 1994, nineteen named authorities running MANA enterprise schemes are
subject to ss5-7 of the Maori Purposes Act 1993. Those provisions are designed to make it
clear that the assets (mostly loans) which these authorities gained under the MANA enterprise
scheme are not assets of the Crown, but rather assets of the authorities themselves (see also
1993 <EM>NZ Parliamentary Debates</EM> vol 536 p16535. The tax implications are spelt
out in <EM>IRD Tax Information Bulletin</EM> vol 5 No 10 March 1994).
<P>
<H3>International Briefs</H3>
This section will appear from time to time providing information on indigenous groups
worldwide, using material mainly from the Internet newsgroup alt.native. The computer
address/source for each item is acknowledged.
<P>
<H3>Uprising in Chiapas, Mexico</H3>
<EM>New Internationalist February 1994, Internet: mail.lmi.org!gwelker</EM><P>
The insurgency which began on New Years Day 1994 in the Chiapas region of Mexico was
timed to coincide with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Indigenous people form the majority of the population in the region. The insurgents were
concerned about cheap grain imports under NAFTA which might affect their livelihood, and
also amendments to the Mexican constitution allowing foreign ownership of their lands.
<P>
<H3>Clinton Invites Indian Leaders to Talks</H3>
<EM>Internet 14 April: vms.cis.pitt.edu!LMITTEN</EM><P>
Leaders of 545 Indian tribes are being invited to meetings with President Clinton at the White
House in late April, and with the Attorney General and Interior Secretary on May 5-6 in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Albuquerque conference will focus on issues involving the
Justice and Interior Departments, including tribal jurisdiction, Indian gaming, religious
freedom
and tribal courts. The administration has been recently criticized for a proposed 13 percent cut
in the 1995 budget for the Indian Health Service which provides medical care to 1.3 million
Indians as required by treaties with the federal government.
<P>
<H3>Controversial Dam Project in Malaysia</H3>
<EM>Internet 18 April: jym@remarque.berkeley.edu</EM><P>
The Malaysia government is embarking on a dam building project which will involve
clearcutting 80,000 hectares of forest and the forced resettlement of 5000 people.  Much of
the
forest area is claimed by indigenous communities as their Native Customary Land.  Indigenous
people in Long Geng have already been jailed for their part in demonstrating and blockading
logging roads in an attempt to protect their land from other logging projects there.
Hydro-Quebec (which includes the Quebec State Government) will serve as a consultant on
the dam project.
<P>
<H3>Zinc-Copper Mine Proposed near Indian Reserves</H3>
<EM>Internet 22 April: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us</EM><P>
Exxon Minerals and a Canadian mining company, have entered into a joint venture to mine
one
of the world's largest zinc-copper sulfide deposits. The proposed mine is to be situated at the
headwaters of Wisconsin's Wolf River and adjacent to the Mole Lake Indian Reservation,
covering an area of 866 acres, of which more than 10% are wetlands. There is concern that
sulfuric mining wastes will harm trout fishing in the Wolf River, wild rice beds on the Mole
Chippewa Reservation, and water quality for humans and wildlife.
<P>
<H3>Mescalero Apache Nuclear Waste Dump</H3>
<EM>Internet 21 April: milo@scicom.AlphaCDC.COM</EM><P>
The Mescalero Apache tribe and the Minnesota-based Northern States Power Company
signed
an agreement last month to negotiate building a temporary storage complex on tribal land in
south-central New Mexico. Spent fuel from nuclear power plants would be stored at the site.
<P>
<H3>Peruvian Initiative for Conservation</H3>
<EM>Internet 15 April: perezoso@igc.apc.org</EM><P>
A representative body of the Aguaruna and Huambisa peoples of Peru's northeastern Amazon
has recently initiated "Proyecto Ikam Ayamjut" ("Project We Defend the Jungle"), an initiative
that links the conservation concerns of Western environmentalists with the autonomous,
ecologically sustainable development concerns of Amazonian peoples. The project seeks to
establish several scientific centers in Peru's Upper Maranon Basin which will join indigenous
groups and Western scientists in research on the ecology of the Amazon in a cooperative
mode
that emphasizes the value of traditional knowledge, the development desires of it's indigenous
people, and the conservation priorities that environmentalists and the indigenous groups share.

<H2>Tertiary Education and "Option B"<HR></H2>
Education, its funding and its future is an area of strong emotions and ready opinions (no
apologies for adding another). The <EM>Report of the Ministerial Consultative Group on
Funding Growth in Tertiary Education and Training</EM> is notable for the controversy
surrounding "Option B", which, on its face, appears to be a vigorous attempt to upskill poorly
performing groups such as Maori by increasing payments from students who in later years will
have high earnings, and directing the savings to groups presently under-represented in tertiary
education.
<P>
Already, a claim has been filed with the tribunal alleging, mainly, a lack of consultation (Wai
431. The tribunal is seeking further details of the Treaty principles involved and how the
claimants have been affected). The taskforce notes in the report that it was asked to state that
there was insufficient time to fully consult with Maori.
<P>
Option B is specific about the sums of money which could be redirected to under-represented
groups ($100 million per annum plus $200 million over the next 6 years), and about the
criteria
to be used for targeting grants. But, while attractive, there are several concerns. Was enough
consideration given to the natural slowing in the numbers reaching tertiary age over the
coming
decade? Option B talks about a "significant expansion in demand", but admits that the growth
in the number of 18-24 year olds in the next decade "will be modest". 
<P>
"Fairness" is a key criteria, leading Option B proponents to suggest that those eventually
achieving high lifetime earnings should pay up to 50% of tuition costs. It is also admitted that
upfront "costs" such as loans are most discouraging to people on low incomes - something the
student representatives on the taskforce gave practical examples of, and Maori submissions
made particular complaint about. This effect would be partly, but possibly not fully, addressed
by targeted assistance programmes.
<P>
Unquestionably, as the report shows, the loans scheme and other recent changes have
increased Maori participation in tertiary education. It is also helpfully suggested that there
should be continuing research on factors affecting Maori educational achievement. Maori
unemployment (at 25%) is a continuing national scandal and significant steps need to be taken.
But it should hardly be surprising that some Maori groups view with caution the idea that a
"user pays" approach will deliver the goods.

<H3>Whakatohea Raupatu Claim Representatives</H3>
<EM>69 Opotiki MB 11-26, 2 February 1994, Hingston J</EM><P>
This order names 14 persons to act as negotiators for and on behalf of Whakatohea in all
matters connected with achieving a settlement of the Whakatohea raupatu claim before the
Waitangi Tribunal. Claude Edwards was named claim manager.
<P>
[ed: this appears to be the first order under s30(1)(b)/1993 providing for the Chief Judge to
refer an application for determination of the most appropriate representatives of a group
involved in negotiations. Court minutes show that the hearings became a forum for an
extended
discussion of authority within the tribe. Two additional members of the court, who were not
judges and were chosen for their expertise, were appointed by the Chief Judge to assist in
hearing the application.]
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>The Muriwhenua land claims</H3>
<EM>Wai 45, Doc N2, 28 April 1994</EM><P>
Closing the substantive case for the claimants, counsel asked that the tribunal in its report
recommend that the Aupouri State Forest be returned to Maori ownership under the Crown
Forest Assets Act 1989. This is the first forest claim where the tribunal has heard almost all
the
evidence and can properly consider such a recommendation. Further hearings follow in June.
The tribunal report is expected later in the year.
<P>
<H3>Pepepe land claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 185, 6 May 1994, CJ Durie</EM><P>
Retired Deputy Chief Judge Ashley McHugh has been appointed to mediate a settlement of
this claim concerning around 4 hectares of land in Huntly taken for education purposes (an
intermediate school) and allegedly not used for this purpose.
<P>
<H3>Exploratory Report on Wai 128 filed by Dame Whina Cooper on behalf of Te Rarawa
Ki Hokianga</H3>
<EM>Wai 128, April 1994. R Daamen</EM><P>
A 140 page report with document bank by a tribunal researcher examining Crown activities in
the area from the north side of the Hokianga harbour to Whangape harbour, in the 19th and
20th centuries, covering old land claims, Native Land Court activity, Crown purchases, state
forest development, scenic reserves takings, foreshore issues.

<EM>Wai 201, A Ballara and G Scott. January 1994</EM><P>
A two volume report accompanied by 4 volumes of primary documents, by claimant
commissioned researchers, discussing Crown actions in the purchase of 38 blocks, with
references to over 230 blocks. The 202 page introduction contains an analysis and conclusions
about the adequacy and appropriateness of Crown actions in relation to purchases generally.
The purchase history of each of the 38 blocks is then separately considered.

<H3>Te Runanga o Wharekauri Rekohu Inc v The Waitangi Tribunal and others</H3>
<EM>CP 118/94, Wellington, 12 May 1994, Heron J</EM><P>
An application seeking interim orders restraining the tribunal from hearing claims by Moriori
groups. Groups of Taranaki Maori invaded the Chatham Islands in 1837 and killed and
enslaved the Moriori population. Later Native Land Court hearings to determine customary
title
to land in the Chathams awarded 97% to Taranaki Maori on the basis of the "1840 rule",
which upheld all conquests prior to 1840. Moriori claims before the tribunal allege, among
other matters, that the Crown breached the principles of the Treaty in failing to prevent this
result before the Native Land Court, and in failing to respond to Moriori protests about the
court determination. They also allege that the Crown responsibility is direct, because the court
acted as a "statutory agent" of the Crown. The claims directly attack the court application of
the 1840 rule.
<P>
Applicants representing descendants of Taranaki Maori with interests in the Chatham Islands
sought to prevent the tribunal hearing these claims. The interim orders were sought just days
before the tribunal was due to fly to the Chatham Islands to being hearings. An initial
submission seeking to prevent any tribunal inquiry was modified, with the applicants seeking
merely to restrict the scope of the inquiry to be undertaken. The major ground being that the
tribunal could not investigate allegations that the Native Land Court acted as a statutory agent
of the Crown, and could not therefore investigate the determinations of the Native Land Court
and the application of the 1840 rule. Such an investigation might threaten holders of freehold
title who traced that title back to Land Court determinations. The tribunal should not
investigate matters which were essentially a dispute between tribes and not about Crown
actions. The motive behind the Moriori claim was a desire to boost their entitlement to fishing
quota.
<P>
Held: that the tribunal should proceed with the inquiry:
<BR>
- the Maori applicants did not question that Moriori were Maori in terms of Tribunal
jurisdiction to hear claims of Maori;
<BR>
- s6 Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 gives the tribunal a broad jurisdiction;
<BR>
- allegations in the Moriori claim related mainly to Crown actions and largely circumvented
direct complaints about the workings of the Native Land Court;
<BR>
- "procedural commonsense" suggested that the Court should not direct the tribunal not to
hear
any particular sort of evidence in advance;
<BR>
- historical background to the claims would be an inevitable topic in any investigation
undertaken. There was no practical way of "ring fencing" tribunal jurisdiction in advance of an
inquiry;
<BR>
- the tribunal had shown itself well aware of the jurisdictional issues that might arise (tribunal
memorandum quoted noting jurisdictional issues and the tribunal powers to defer or end its
inquiry on particular issues if this was warranted);
<BR>
- as to inter-tribal disputes: if the Crown had in the past treated one group differently to
another
that may be the subject of a finding and recommendations;
<BR>
- motives are generally irrelevant where statutory rights are being exercised;
<BR>
- a proper investigation could not avoid discussion of what the Native Land Court did.
Without
deciding the issue, there would seem to be a "strongly arguable case" that the actions of the
Land Court were not the actions of the Crown. The statement of claim was at present
"unhappily worded" in this respect. "I am quite confident the argument relating to the
separation of the powers and the functions of the Court as opposed to Parliament will be
apparent enough to the Tribunal and will no doubt be a consideration when or if the Tribunal
makes recommendations."
<P>
Commenting on the procedure adopted, the applicants were criticised for raising fundamental
questions of jurisdiction by way of informal and unilateral letters to the tribunal. The onus was
on the applicants seeking to challenge jurisdiction to request a formal hearing before the
tribunal on the matters at issue.
<P>
[ed: as noted in an earlier Review (March 1994), Whanganui River claimants have asked the
tribunal to "review" the Native Land Court on the basis of a 'Treaty test' rather than a strictly
legal one (although how these differ is not specified in detail), and make findings accordingly.
The issue has constitutional importance since it goes to the separation of powers, as Heron J
has mentioned in this case. The outcome may not be as straightforward as his Honour
suggests.
The tribunal in it's <EM>Te Roroa</EM> report (Wai 38, 1992) said that the Native Land
Court was an agent of the Crown (p153-154). Another example is the period of the Maori
Land Boards after 1900, where the functions of Native Land Court judges were virtually
indistinguishable from their role as presidents of those boards.]
<P>
<H3>Quarantine Waste (NZ) Ltd v Waste Resources Ltd & Another</H3>
<EM>CP 306/93, Auckland, 2 March 1994, Blanchard J</EM><P>
Waste Resources Ltd operate an incinerator at Auckland International Airport to dispose of
waste from aircraft. They sought a consent to use its excess capacity to incinerate waste from
outside the airport. This was granted by the local council, subject to certain restrictions, and
without notification or hearings under s94(2) of the RMA (where the consent authority is
satisfied that the adverse effect on the environment will be minor, and written approval has
been obtained from all persons the authority thinks may be adversely affected). Quarantine
Waste brought an application for judicial review of that decision. 
<P>
Among other matters, it suggested that the council had not taken into account Maori concerns
because it had not consulted directly with Maori groups. Further evidence at the hearing
showed that Waste Resources was involved in ongoing consultation with local Maori interests
about the incinerator, particularly in relation to the destruction of medical waste and body
parts. There were no concerns expressed about the consent and a kaumatua worked at the
incinerator site. The council was aware that the Airport Authority (joint owner of Waste
Resources Ltd) was in "continuous consultation" with the Maori about airport developments
and Waste Resources advised the council that consultation had occurred about this consent.
The council considered this indirect consultation adequate, and also thought there were no
matters in this consent which needed to be raised with Maori interests.
<P>
Held: on the matter of consultation, the statutory and Treaty obligation of consultation with
Maori is placed on the consent authority, not on an applicant for a resource consent. Section 7
(s8 surely?) imposes a duty on the consent authority to be on inquiry - <EM>Gill v Rotorua
District Council</EM>  (1993) 2 NZRMA 604. In other circumstances, there would be "very
real qualms" about "second hand consultation", which carries the potential for distortion by
the
applicant of Maori views. In this case,  the failure to directly consult did not lead to the
council
failing to take into account a relevant factor.  
<P>
[ed: This case endorses the view that territorial authorities must take an active approach to
consultation and cannot leave the issue to applicants for resource consents. The case does not
directly address the issue raised in the <EM>Hanton</EM> case (Planning Tribunal A10/94)
that consent authorities would be seen to be biased by actively consulting Maori prior to
deciding on a consent. The correct approach may be that suggested in the <EM>Rural
Management</EM> case (W35/94), reviewed below.]
<P>
<H3>Rural Management Ltd v Banks Peninsula District Council</H3>
<EM>W 35/94, 5 May 1994, Treadwell J, with commissioners Johnson &
McIntyre</EM><P>
The appellant had taken over a subdivision scheme begun some years prior to the passing of
the RMA. A right to discharge sewage into the sea was cancelled by the advent of that Act.
Under s372, a ministerial directive had been issued that sewage discharge directly into the sea
without passage through soil or wet land was a restricted coastal activity. The cultural
sensitivities of Maori were the justification for the reference to passage through soil.
Applications for restricted activities required a report and recommendation from the relevant
regional council to the Minister of Conservation, who, as the consent authority, made a final
decision. The tribunal considered in this case appeals against the regional council report
recommending the grant of a right to discharge sewage into the sea after treatment, including
passage through sand filters. Among other issues, the tribunal considered concerns expressed
by local Maori about the physical and spiritual implications of the sewage scheme, and an
alleged lack of consultation.
<P>
Held: the ministerial directive was indeterminate, in particular leaving uncertain whether
passage of sewage through 'soil' included sand filtration. Maori objections should not prevent
the sewage discharge proposal proceeding. Effluent would be treated to a quality where
kaimoana would be unaffected physically. It would pass through several treatment stages,
including sand filters, before discharge into the sea. While appreciating the Maori view that
discharge into the sea offends against mana, and that land based systems are therefore
preferable, nearby land based systems were experiencing problems (eg overflow into streams),
giving some cause for alarm. 
<P>
As to the responsibility of local Maori as kaitiaki, kaitiakitanga is not a concept restricted to
Maori. The council in recommending the sewage scheme was guarding and improving taonga.
The scheme should proceed provided it remained under council and not private control. 
Regarding consultation with the developers, earlier Maori acquiesence, after discussions, in a
long outfall proposal was noted. While failing to attend consultation meetings arranged by the
developers could be a way of signifying disapproval, there was no breach of a Treaty duty to
consult if the Maori side withdrew in this way without giving reasons. 
<P>
Regarding consultation with the council, a consent authority should not consult unilaterally
with
one party. The Treaty did not set aside the fundamental principle against the appearance of
bias. <EM>Ngatiwai</EM> (A 7/94) and <EM>Hanton</EM> (A3/94) decisions support this
view. <EM>Gill</EM> ((1993) 2 NZRMA 604) and <EM>Haddon</EM> (A77/93) should
be read in the context of their own facts. However, consent authorities can refer an application
back to parties before hearing for further consultation. Officers of the consent authority can
consult prior to hearing, but for the purpose of relaying information only.
<P>
[ed: The danger of loosely drafted provisions in the resource law area is highlighted. This
particularly affects Maori concepts in resource law (see comments on the Coastal Policy
Statement reviewed below). Traditional views about the spiritual impact of sewage discharges
into the sea face an interesting dilemma where such systems are less polluting than land based
systems, and use sand/soil filtration processes. 
<P>
There now appear to be differing opinions over the approach to "kaitiaki". Most tribunal
decisions have assumed it is a Maori-only concept. In <EM>NZ Rail Ltd & Ors v Malborough
District Council</EM> (C36/93) the tribunal doubted a submission suggesting it might apply
to
non-Maori. This view seems to be supported by the coastal policy statement comment that
"tangata whenua are the kaitiaki of the coastal environment" (see below), and the lengthy
discussion of the term as a Maori concept in the board of inquiry report on the statement
(<EM>Report and Recommendations</EM>, February 1994, under "Definitions").
<P>
The suggestion that council planning officers undertake consultation and relay the results to
the
council may resolve the apparent differences between the <EM>Gill/Haddon</EM> and
<EM>Ngatiwai/Hanton</EM> decisions. The comments of Blanchard J in the
<EM>Quarantine Waste</EM> case (reviewed above) suggest however that the consultation
issue may not yet be finally settled.]
<P>
<H3>Te Tii (Waitangi) A-Marae & Others v Northland Regional Council & Another</H3>
<EM>A 25/94, 31 March 1994, Sheppard J</EM><P>
A land-use consent was granted to a local council to establish a cemetery. Submissions from
local Maori were considered at the hearing. Submitters were notified of the decision and of the
15 day period in which to lodge appeals. The applicants sought a waiver of the time restriction
on filing an appeal. The council had purchased the land for the cemetery relying on the lack of
appeal and argued that it would be unduly prejudiced were the time requirement waived. 
<P>
Held: rejecting the application, that s281(2) and (3) RMA required the tribunal to be satisfied
that no party would suffer prejudice greater than that which might be reasonably expected and
unavoidable if the waiver were allowed. A capital commitment had been entered into so that
the council would suffer considerably more than just the delay were the waiver given.
<P>
<H2><HR>General</H2>
<H3>Results of the Maori Option</H3>
<EM>Minister of Justice 22/4/1994, Government Statistician 4/5/1994</EM><P>
There will be 5 Maori seats under MMP. The Maori option increased the Maori roll from
104,414 to 136,708 (by 31%), there now being more Maori on the Maori roll than the general
roll. The Auckland region has the largest Maori electoral population (63,053).
<P>
<H3>Draft Minerals Programme for Petroleum</H3>
<EM>May 1994, Energy & Resources Division, Ministry of Commerce</EM><P>
This document outlines government policy for managing petroleum, a Crown-owned mineral
under the Crown Minerals Act 1991, throughout NZ, including the seabed to the 200 mile
limit. The CMA states that persons exercising functions under the Act shall "have regard" to
the principles of the Treaty. The draft suggests this requires that the Crown act reasonably and
in good faith, make informed decisions, and consider if any decision will impeded the
settlement of outstanding Maori grievances.  At the request of an "iwi" (a term which is not
defined), designated areas of land of particular importance to the mana of the iwi may be
excluded from the programme (s15(3)). No such requests have yet been received.
<P>
It is proposed to allocate rights to exploit petroleum, in the main, via "Petroleum Exploration
Permit Block Offers". This involves competitive tendering for permits which would give the
right to explore defined areas or "blocks". Maori will be consulted before any particular block
offer is made and will be given not less than 1 month to comment. Again, "iwi" may request
that areas of particular importance to their mana within a proposed block be excluded from an
offer. Details are given of the types of matters the Minister would consider in determining
whether to exclude an area (para 3.13). These include the existence of a claim to the Waitangi
Tribunal, iwi management plans for the area, whether other legislation already places
protection over the area eg resource management and historic places legislation.
<P>
Seven hui, including one national hui, were held in 1992 to consider Maori viewpoints on
minerals programmes generally (notice of this draft must be sent to "all iwi" (s16(1)(b))).
Submissions must be filed with the Ministry of Commerce by the 11 July 1994.
<P>
[ed: there is dispute about the Crown nationalisation of petroleum in 1937. In the Taranaki
claims before the Waitangi Tribunal, evidence has been produced that Maori politicians raised
Treaty issues before the 1937 legislation was passed. The requirement for officials to "have
regard" to the principles of the Treaty (CMA s4) can be compared to the stricter requirement
on authorities to "take into account" Treaty principles under the Resource Management Act
1991 (s8). There remains the perennial problem of just what constitutes an iwi and who has
the
authority to seek the exemption of areas from minerals programmes and permits. The draft
interprets "iwi" as "tangata whenua hapu and iwi" - no doubt deriving assistance from
definitions in the RMA (s2(1) "tangata whenua", "iwi authority", "mana whenua"). Maori
submissions involving sensitive issues receive some protection under CMA s17(7) which
provides that notwithstanding the Official Information Act 1982, the Minister may refuse to
make information in submissions available if satisfied that a serious offence to tikanga Maori
or
disclosure of the location of waahi tapu might result, and this consideration outweighs the
public interest in making the information available.]
<P>
<H3>NZ Coastal Policy Statement 1994</H3>
<EM>5 May 1994, Department of Conservation/Te Papa Atawhai</EM><P>
This is the final statement, to which regional policies and regional and district plans must
conform, affecting land and sea areas below high water springs, and the land backdrop to the
coast. A board of inquiry investigated the draft and received submissions. Large parts of the
draft were reworded. Almost all of these changes appear to have been incorporated. Points of
interest:
<P>
- "tangata whenua are the kaitiaki of the coastal environment" (General Principle 9);
<BR>
- a requirement that, in relation to identified "characteristics" of special value to tangata
whenua
(ie waahi tapu and the like) local authorities consider delegation of management to iwi
authorities, or a special committee of the local authority including iwi representatives (under
ss33 & 34 RMA) (Policy 2.1.3);
<BR>
- restrictions may be imposed on public access to the coastal marine area where it is necessary
to "protect Maori cultural values" (Policy 3.5.1(b));
<BR>
- in relation to land of the Crown in the marine coastal area, Maori customary knowledge
about
the coastal environment is to be incorporated in policy statements and plans and in the
consideration of resource consent applications (Policy 4.2.2(e));
<BR>
- discharges of human sewage directly into water, without passing through land, shall occur
only where this better meets the purpose of the RMA than disposal on land, and Maori
viewpoints have been fully considered (Policy 5.1.2).
<P>
[ed: the policy providing for restrictions, where necessary, on public access to the coast to
better protect Maori cultural values does not give guidance on the sort of situations in which
this policy would apply. The board of inquiry simply referred to s6(e) and s8 of the RMA. It
will perhaps dovetail with forthcoming fishing regulations providing for Maori management of
some coastal areas.]
<P>
<H3>Funding Growth in Tertiary Education and Training</H3>
<EM>Report of the Ministerial Consultative Group, 12 May 1994.</EM><P>
A report considering how the substantial and continuing growth in tertiary education should
be
funded in the face of ongoing fiscal constraints. 71,000 places in tertiary education were
funded in 1985 costing $580 million, this figure was 132,000 places costing $1986 million in
1993. The group recommended consideration of 2 funding options, A and B (2 members
abstaining), both including rises in private contributions. 
<P>
Maori participation in tertiary education is growing but at a rate substantially lower than for
the
rest of the population. In 1993 there were 18,527 Maori in tertiary courses (9.6% of total
tertiary places). Of these, 10,573 were full time students. Compared with non-Maori, Maori
students were more likely to be in polytechnics taking full-time courses, or, if at university,
taking part-time courses. They were less likely to enter a formal assessment process, tended to
sit fewer papers, and on average were awarded lower grades. The growing Maori population
is
experiencing significantly higher rates of unemployment than non-Maori (25% vs 10%) and
lower rates of education generally (50% having no school or tertiary qualification, 31% for
non-Maori). Maori submissions were noted which stressed; a recognition that the history and
politics of education affect Maori participation (eg ethnocentrism), greater Maori control in
education was required, student fees and loans act as a considerable disincentive, and special
funding assistance is required.
<P>
Option A notes that all predictions for tertiary participation after 1994 show growth will not
be
as great as from 1990-94, and argues that maintaining and building on recent reforms is the
best course. The appropriate funding split is 75% public to 25% private contribution. No
specific measures for greater Maori participation were noted.
<P>
Option B similarly notes modest growth in numbers of 18-24 year olds in the coming decade,
but seeks to address the needs of those presently unskilled. Financial barriers should not deny
access to education. Fairness demands that those who benefit most should bear some costs. By
the year 2000, students whose lifetime earnings exceed a threshold level should make a
contribution not exceeding 50% of tuition costs. This greater contribution will allow $100
million per annum to be reallocated to pre-school and compulsory education and $200 million
over 6 years to tertiary education and training of under-represented groups.
<P>
The two dissenting members proposed that growth in tertiary education be funded from
general
taxation, present costs to students should not be increased, the discouraging effect of fees
increases should be considered.
<P>
<H3>Employment. The Issues</H3>
<EM>Prime Ministerial Task Force on Employment, May 1994</EM><P>
The first report of the taskforce resulting from the joint party agreement to address
employment issues. Contains an uninspiring analysis of the unemployment situation, and the
assertion that "The Treaty of Waitangi is the founding document of our nation. Article III in
particular guarantees the rights and privileges of citizenship to all New Zealanders". The
extraordinarily high rate of joblessness among Maori does not receive separate analysis.
Submissions are now sought, and an Options paper will follow in September 1994.
<P>
<H3>Report of Te Ohu Kai Moana/Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission for the year
ended September 1993</H3>
<EM>Tabled on 29 March 1994</EM><P>
The first report of the reconstituted commission formerly known as the Maori Fisheries
Commission. Outlines activities of the new commission in the period to September 1993
including work on a new fisheries act, which is ongoing. 
<P>
[ed: Te Ohu Kai Moana recently announced it has been unable to begin allocation of fishing
assets directly to iwi in 1994 (consultation is ongoing), and it will again lease its wetfish
holdings for the 1994/95 season. Iwi have until 10 June 1994 to comment on lease proposals,
including inshore wetfish quota being assigned on the basis of coastline, and deep-water quota
being assigned on a combined coastline (50%) and population (50%) basis (Panui 20 Haratua
1994). The Minister of Fisheries has announced the scrapping of a proposal to impose a catch
levy, which would have been opposed by Maori as a breach of the Treaty. Instead, fishing
operators will pay the costs incurred by government in managing commercial fisheries. How
this will be charged to operators has not yet been finalised.]

<H2><HR>Maori Science and Law</H2>
In a recent paper, "Maori Science. Can Traditional Maori Knowledge be Considered
Scientific?" (<EM>NZ Science Monthly</EM>, May 1994, Mike Dickison), and at a recent
lecture in Wellington organised by the Skeptics Society, it was argued that Maori did not 'do
science' because "Maori knowledge acquisition was neither objective (relying as it did on
religious faith), rational (it mixed supernatural with mundane explanations), nor co-operative
(it
relied on authority rather than challenge and consensus)." Science is about questioning the
mechanisms behind the workings of the world. Simply having knowledge and applying it to
create technology is not enough. 
<P>
This sort of argument seems to make as much sense as a Maori chief observing an atom bomb
test and remarking, "but this is merely technology". Perhaps the missionary Richard Taylor
had
something like this in mind when he said, on observing eel weirs on the Whanganui river, that
these constructions were too ingenious to have been made by Maori!  As for reliance on
religion, many important scientific discoveries were made by devout European Christians (I
was always taught that a monk discovered the basic principles of genetics). 
<P>
In 1967 the English born African academic Robin Horton suggested another approach
("African Traditional Thought and Western Science" <EM>Africa</EM> v37 p50). By
concentrating on the similarities rather than the differences between Western and African
thought, he concluded that "like atoms, molecules, and waves, ... the [African] gods serve to
introduce unity into diversity, simplicity into complexity, order into disorder, regularity into
anomaly". The essential difference between African thought and Western science was not a
Western monopoly on the ability to rationalise or inquire, but rather a tendency towards
'depersonification' of the thinking process. Literacy had a large part to play in this movement.
Horton believed that once this point was grasped, seemingly irrational traditional thinking and
action became comprehensible to the Western mind. His argument, despite revisions, is still
widely respected today (see <EM>Times Literary Supplement</EM> 2 July 1993).
<P>
Horton's analysis has an obvious application to law. Any tendency to view Maori traditional
law
and ideas as essentially "irrational", "spiritual" and "other", prevents a proper appreciation of
their jurisprudential value.
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>In re AMP Perpetual Trustee Company NZ Ltd and Faulkner and the Poripori Farm
Trust</H3>
<EM>53 Tauranga MB 132, 12 April 1994, Carter J</EM><P>
An application for the Court to exercise its jurisdiction under s240(a) to remove a trustee for
failing to carry out his duties satisfactorily.
<P>
Held: s240 provides wider grounds for removal than the 1953 Act, adding the ground of
failure
to carry out duties satisfactorily (the 1953 Act referred to powers under the Trustee Act 1953
allowing removal for particular matters only). Natural justice principles apply and the trustee
must have full notice of any allegations made.
<P>
If the Court determines to remove a trustee under s240 it can proceed under s239 (addition,
reduction and replacement of trustees) and make a consequential order reducing the number of
trustees.
<P>
The test of satisfactory performance need not be solely objective. The Court can consider the
nature of the trust, its performance, and views and expectations of the owners. Section 17(1)
directs the Court to have regard to the primary objectives of retention of land in the hands of
the owners and the effective use, management and development of the land. If the owners
believe that discord between trustees is hindering the work of the trust, the Court may have
regard to those views. Where trustees are "fighting" the primary objective of administering
land
is sometimes diminished.
<P>
This factor and lack of attendance at meetings, general argumentativeness and difficulty
working with other trustees gave grounds for removal for unsatisfactory performance in this
case. In this case the discretion would not be exercised because of the failure to accord natural
justice in the allegations made by the trust against the trustee, and because of the failure to
follow trust provisions in dealings with the trustee and in coming to the resolution to remove
him (a decision not to send notice of meetings to the trustee was a course "fraught with
danger").
<P>
Noted that a trustee cannot be criticised for exercising the right to seek directions from the
Court on any matter. Section 17(1) seems to provide room for the Court to remove a trustee
who cannot "work reasonably" with fellow trustees, although holding merely different or
opposing views would not be sufficient grounds.
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>The Whanganui River claim. Opening Submissions of Counsel for the Crown</H3>
<EM>Wai 167, 20 June 1994</EM><P>
At the hearing in June, Crown counsel made the following submissions. Negotiations in this
claim are paused because the Crown is developing an approach to negotiations with respect to
natural resources policy generally. The claimants frustration at this approach is acknowledged.
The Crown has title to the beds of navigable rivers, including the Whanganui river, by virtue of
the Coal Mines Act 1979, its predecessors, and s354 Resource Management Act 1991. The
sale of riparian lands implied a relinquishment of any property rights located in the adjacent
river. There is no evidence of an expectation that exclusive rights would persist after sale. The
ad medium filum principle is acceptable in Treaty terms as "giving a formal legal expression to
property interests associated with land." In this sense, the principle is consistent with Maori
perspectives. While the process of the application of the principle may give rise to a breach of
Treaty principles, the principle itself does not.
<P>
The spiritual relationship with the river has not been communicated to the Crown until
relatively recently. It would be inappropriate to convert this to a property right.

<EM>CP 322/93, Wellington, 13 May 1994, Greig J</EM><P>
An application by the third defendant (Ngai Tahu Maori Trust Board) to dismiss proceedings
brought by the plaintiffs seeking judicial review of the Waitangi Tribunal and Maori Appellate
Court for their handling of a case stated to the Maori Appellate Court on the question of tribal
boundaries in the South Island (the decision on the case stated was appealed unsuccessfully to
the Privy Council). 
<P>
Held: that the proceedings should be dismissed. The allegation that the plaintiffs were not
consulted over the form of the case stated drawn up by the Waitangi Tribunal was contrary to
the facts, but, in any event, the Tribunal had the right under s6A(3) Treaty of Waitangi Act
1975 to settle the terms of the case stated. Allegations that the Maori Appellate Court failed to
proceed in accord with Maori custom could not be upheld, that Court having discretion to
order its own procedures and with knowledge of the relevant customs to be adopted. As to
the
allegation that the MAC had accepted the "1840 rule" as binding, the rule appears to be a
"well
accepted principle" arising from the need for the Court to fix a date from which raupatu or
"conquest" and inter-tribal warfare, being contrary to public safety and repugnant to English
law, could no longer be condoned. In any event, the 1840 rule was not decisive to the MAC
decision, which referred to peaceful reoccupation of land in that case.

<H3>Southern Scallop Fishery Quota Holders v Tasman District Council and another</H3>
<EM>W24/94, 15 June 1994, Judge Treadwell</EM><P>
In this appeal, local iwi gave evidence in support of an application for a shellfish farm,
stressing
their involvement with the applicant company and the Maori historical association with
fisheries
in the area. This evidence was rejected by the Tribunal. The Maori interest in this case was a
commercial interest, and consequently something which could not be considered because of
the
provisions of the "Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Settlement Act 1993".
<P>
[ed: presumably the reference is to the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act
1992. Section 9(b) provides that, in view of the fisheries settlement with Maori, no court or
tribunal has jurisdiction to inquire into the validity of claims or the rights or interests of Maori
in commercial fisheries. "Claims" refers to rights under common law, the Waitangi Tribunal,
statute, "or otherwise" (s9(a)(i)). This decision appears to be a very broad reading of that
section and the effect of the 1992 Act. The section is very broadly drafted. The alternative
view would be that the 1992 Act was never intended to have such a drastic effect on the
RMA,
and that it relates only to legal claims to the ownership or control of the commercial fishing
resource.]

<H3>Government Position Regarding the Conservation Estate</H3>
<EM>Ministers of Conservation and Treaty Negotiations, 24 June 1994</EM><P>
This Cabinet paper sets out the government position on the settlement of claims affecting
conservation land. The "conservation estate" is "held by the Crown on behalf of all New
Zealanders" and is not "readily available" for the settlement of claims. "Discrete sites" (but
including river and lakebeds and mountains where special significance is demonstrated) could
be considered for settlements. Before any conservation lands are considered, government must
be satisfied that a settlement will not affect the strength of existing legal mechanisms
protecting:
<BR>
- conservation values;
<BR>
- public access;
<BR>
- the rights of existing concessionaires.
<P>
Three possible legal regimes are outlined:
<BR>
- vesting in Maori, in "rare cases", possibly with legislative encumbrances;
<BR>
- vesting in Maori, subject to conditions, and the return of title on non-compliance;
<BR>
- continued Crown ownership, with a significant Maori management role.
<P>
[ed: Maori groups probably already know that conservation land (or any land) is not "readily
available" for settlements. They may be disappointed with this apparent closing off of options
without consultation. Conversely, conservation groups will not be reassured by the general
language used. One commentator has already claimed that the policy broadens the grounds for
using conservation lands in settlements (<EM>Evening Post</EM> 29 June 1994 p20). The
lack of definition is a difficulty. What is the "conservation estate" and what are the values
which that phrase embodies?]

further processes ... is ultimately one for the Minister of Lands to make. The ... Minister of
Lands and Minister of Conservation [Hon Denis Marshall] will, however, consult with me
before making his decision. ... the Department of Conservation is currently completing an
assessment of the conservation and recreation values of the properties to ensure that such

<H3>Claims to National Parks</H3>
<EM>Replies Supplement 28 June 1994 p31</EM><P>
Hon D Graham (Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi negotiations): "... there are no
claims
which specifically relate to National Parks. Most claims are general in nature [with] no
indication of whether or not a National Park is being claimed until the matter comes to formal
hearing ... As an example, the Taranaki Raupatu claim refers to all land confiscated under the
Native Settlements Act [ed: NZ Settlements Act 1863] which would include the Mount
Egmont National Park. ... until final submissions are made, it is not known whether the park
itself will be subject to claim. A similar situation exists with the Urewera National Park and the
Tuhoe claim ...".

<H3>Policy on approvals for customary taking</H3>
<EM>Replies Supplement 7 June 1994 p40</EM><P>
Graham Kelly: "Why did the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries refer a Samoan church
group to a local kaumatua for a permit to harvest seafood for a feast?"
<BR>
Hon Doug Kidd (Minister of Fisheries): "In keeping with the intent of the Treaty of Waitangi
(Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992 my ministry sets the uses for which fish may be taken.
It has no part now, nor has it had in the past, in giving out individual approvals for Maori
customary harvest. That role has been provided in regulation to Maori since 1986.
There are differing views in Maoridom as to whether customary uses includes not only the
right to take fish in a traditional manner, but also the right to approve other groups who may
harvest fish in a customary way. 
<BR>
The issue will be clarified and defined in the customary fisheries regulations that will arise
from
the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992.
<BR>
In this case the kaumatua concerned considered that he was allowed by custom to approve
people other than Maori to harvest under his authority. His right both to grant a permit in the
area concerned and to grant it to a non-Maori group has been challenged."

[ed: the government dropped the idea of a fee mainly because of concern about the legal
impact on the Sealord settlement. The Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission opposed the

culture
by making funds available, on such terms and conditions as [Te Mangai Paho] thinks fit, for

<P>
[ed: this database is "user friendly" and will be an invaluable aid to researchers and lawyers in
the field of Maori claims. Its prime achievement is to order and make sense of the large
number of statutes which affected Maori through the colonial period. It is in its own right a
fascinating study of colonisation through law. Researchers are able to approach an issue
through dates, subjects, type of act (public, local, provincial etc) and key words such
(including
block names in some cases), and quickly map out the relevant law. By way of example, the
keywords "Treaty of Waitangi" produce 51 records, including the Thorndon Reclamation Act
1882, still in force, and a commentary recording the statement of the Maori MP Tawhai that
he
felt sorry for the fish that would be driven from their homes by the act, and "By the Treaty of
Waitangi it was supposed that the Maori were to retain all their goods and property whether
above or below the earth, and the Europeans bought only the surface."]

<H2><HR>Assessing Performance</H2>
Tau Henare (MP for Northern Maori) has asked each government minister: "In each year since
the Act became law, what information, if any, has [the relevant department] provided on
request to the Ministry of Maori Development to assist in its statutory monitoring role under
section 5(1)(b) of the Ministry of Maori Development Act 1991?" (<EM>Replies
Supplement</EM> 12 July 1994). Section 5(1)(b) provides that the Ministry is responsible for
"Monitoring, and  liaising with, each department and agency that provides or has a
responsibility to provide services to or for Maori for the purpose of ensuring the adequacy of
those services." The Act gives no other guidelines on this function. Nor is it spelt out what
must occur if services are found to be inadequate.
<P>
Responses from most departments referred to ongoing liaison and consultation on a number of
issues. For some departments, no formal request for information had been received, although
liaison was occurring. No department provided information about the particular measures it
was using to determine whether its services to Maori were adequate, or how it was performing
against those measures. Undoubtedly, this was in part because answers had necessarily to be
brief. However, this also reflects the vagueness of the 1991 Act.
<P>
The Hon Tirikatene-Sullivan (MP for Southern Maori) has asked each of the government
ministers "Is the Treaty of Waitangi referred to in the mission statement of any department or
ministry under the minister's jurisdiction; if so, how is this reflected in the recent Budget?"
(<EM>Replies Supplement</EM> 19 July 1994). The Budget appears to have contained little
directed specifically towards Maori. The answers to this question are not yet in, but promise to
make interesting reading.
<P>
The government in the coming weeks will, under the new Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994, be
called to answer difficult and quite specific questions about its financial performance. Judging
from the questions of the Maori MPs, in assessing government performance on Maori issues,
perhaps a Treaty Responsibility Act would be helpful.
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>In re Orokawa 3B Block and Dovey Erena Regeling</H3>
<EM>Appeal 1994/7, 4 July 1994, Deputy CJ Smith, Hingston, Carter</EM><P>
Appeal from a decision setting aside land as a reserve under s338/1993 (old s439/1953). In the
course of disposing of an application under s173/1953 concerning the vesting of certain land in
beneficial owners, the court directed the applicant (the Maori Trustee) to convene a meeting
of
all beneficial owners to consider placing residue land in a reservation. The court subsequently,
without further application, reopened the matter and ordered the residue land be reserved
under s338/1993.
<P>
Held: allowing the appeal, there was no application for reservation before the court, and it
therefore lacked jurisdiction to make the s338 order. Section 37(1)/1993 provides that
jurisdiction may be exercised only on the application of any person having an interest in a
matter, the Minister, Chief executive, or a registrar of the court. The only situation in which
the
court can make orders on a matter about which there has been no application is in the course
of
hearing an original application on a matter, and the need for additional orders arises
(s37(3)/1993). In this case, the original application had been disposed of when the court
reopened the matter.
<P>
It was also noted that the appellant had advanced this ground of appeal at the hearing. It had
not been stated in the notice of appeal. Although the Maori Land Court Rules forbid such a
proceeding, the court would permit the new ground to be advanced. As a "titles Court", the
MLC has a responsibility to remedy `patent deficiencies' in lower court proceedings (<EM>In
Re Ngapuna 4 v H Allen Mills and Son Ltd</EM> [1972] 5 Waiariki ACMB 332 and
<EM>In Re Maungatatari 5B1A v Baillie</EM> [1976] 15 Waikato Maniapoto ACMB 188
applied).
<P>
<H3>In Re Matiu Rata and Committee of Management for Muriwhenua Incorporation</H3>
<EM>Appeal 1994/8, 22 June 1994, Deputy CJ Smith, Hingston, Carter</EM><P>
In 1991, at the instruction of the court, the registrar filed an application under s61/1967 to
investigate the incorporation after it had failed to file audited accounts. A long sequence of
hearings followed. An examiners report was filed and considered. There were several
adjournments as the court sought to have up to date accounts presented, culminating in a
hearing in December 1993 at which the court made an order under s61(6)/1967 appointing 7
new members to the committee of management, impliedly replacing the existing members. It
then dismissed the s61 application since further investigation was unnecessary. It was argued
that the court lacked jurisdiction to make the order replacing committee members, and made it
in breach of natural justice in not giving notice to existing members.
<P>
Held: the court undoubtedly had power to direct the registrar to file an application and to
order
an inquiry under s61/1967 given the failure to file audited accounts up to 1991. However, a
fresh application, and fresh notice, would have been required to investigate the late filing of
accounts after 1991. Consequently, directions relating to the filing of later accounts moved
beyond investigation and towards a monitoring of the continuing activities of the
incorporation.
There was no jurisdiction under s61 to do this.
<P>
The orders flowing from this wrongful exercise of jurisdiction were therefore flawed. The
order replacing committee members also failed because no notice was given as required under
s61(5) and by principles of natural justice.
<P>
The failure to file accounts nevertheless established a prima facie case for removal of some or
all of the committee. This issue was therefore referred back to the lower court to consider
action not only under s61(5) but also s61(6) which gives wide powers to remedy any
deficiencies or problems experienced by an incorporation.
<P>
Finally, the order dismissing further proceedings under s61 after appointing new committee
members was a nullity, as the court disposed of all matters under the s61 application on the
making of the appointments.
<P>
<H3>In Re Ongarahu B and Eriapa Maru Uruamo</H3>
<EM>4 July 1994, Deputy CJ Smith, Hingston, Carter</EM><P>
Appeal against an order appointing trustees to replace existing trustees. It was argued that
inadequate notice was given and the court lacked jurisdiction to make the orders.
<P>
Held: allowing the appeal, that the notice of meeting did not specify what the meeting would
be
about. That many people might have been aware of the subject of the meeting was not
sufficient. Presumed notice is not adequate notice (<EM>Jennings v Scott</EM> (1984) High
Court Rotorua A1 83/79 applied). In addition, there is no jurisdiction to remove trustees
under
s338(7)/1993, but only power to vest land in trustees and appoint new or additional trustees.
Trustees may only be removed under s240/1993, which requires prior notice to be given to
those trustees affected.

<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Whanganui River claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 167, D18, 27 July 1994, counsel for claimants</EM><P>
In closing submissions, remedies sought by the claimants were outlined. The major
recommendations sought being that the Crown reject the application for a water conservation
order for the river and recognise the Whanganui River as having legal personality, as the
tupuna awa of the Whanganui iwi (reference made to English cases concerning Hindu religious
institutions recognised as 'juristic entities', <EM>Mullick</EM> (1925) 52 LR Indian Appeals
245, <EM>Bumper</EM> [1991] 4 All ER 638). Under such a regime, the iwi would manage
and control use of the river for the benefit of the river, the Whanganui iwi and the wider
community in accordance with the Treaty of Waitangi. From December 1998 or an earlier
agreed date, Whanganui iwi would be given sole right to make laws for management and
control of the river (including repeal of s354 RMA saving Crown rights to the river bed under
the Coal Mines Act/Mining Act). Existing rights would continue until that date. The claimants
also seek, if required, Crown assistance to enable the rehearing of the 1962 Court of Appeal
decision dismissing a claim to legal title to the bed of the Whanganui River (the Court of
Appeal in <EM>Te Runanga o Te Ika Whenua v A-G</EM> [1994] 2 NZLR 20, 26-27 made
obiter comments that the approach in the 1962 case may have been limited, since the
aboriginal
title doctrine was not raised). Crown counsel argued that the claim in its current form is a
recent development, and that, in the past, interests in the river have been alienated as riparian
lands were sold. The ad medium filum rule applies and accords to an extent with Maori
custom
regarding interests in rivers.

The Maori incorporation, Proprietors of Waitutu, appealed against the refusal of the district
council to issue certificates of compliance enabling the incorporation to fell indigenous timber
on the 2145 hectare Waitutu block. The block had originally been set aside for Maori under
the
South Island Landless Natives Act 1906.
<P>
The incorporation made two applications for certificates of compliance under s139 RMA. It
first sought approval for the logging of trees on the block for commercial sale, then for the
clearing of trees to permit grazing by deer. In each case the council would not approve the
tree
felling aspect of the proposals.
<P>
Held: as to the first approval sought, if the clearance of existing trees and planting of a
production forest could be seen as one linked and continuous activity, then a certificate might
issue under the existing district plan, but clearing the existing indigenous forest was a
significant
activity in its own right, and not permitted by the plan. As to the approval sought to permit
clearance for grazing, similarly, the clearance of trees constituted a significant activity in its
own right and was not merely incidental to the preparation of the land for grazing.
<P>
Regarding Part II s8 and the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; if this were an application
for
a resource consent Part II would be relevant. It is doubtful whether Part II has to be
considered
when simply interpreting the provisions of a district plan, even though the purpose is to grant
a
certificate of compliance which is deemed to be a resource consent. Accordingly, evidence
about the history of the land and its setting aside for landless Maori did not assist in
determining the appeals.
<P>
In any case, the felling of this indigenous forest might well fail to achieve "sustainable
management" as set out in s5 RMA (managing in a sustainable way while avoiding, remedying
or mitigating adverse effects). 
<P>
It was noted that the Crown, which owns the former Waitutu State Forest adjacent to the
Waitutu block, and may add the former state forest land to the Fiordland National Park, had
an
interest in seeing that the forest on the Waitutu block remains untouched, but has no present
intention to acquire it. On the basis of these interests in the adjacent land, the Department of
Conservation was permitted to be heard (it had an interest greater than the general public -
s274). Although the Department had been late by several days in filing notices of intention to
be heard, this requirement was waived (there was no prejudice to other parties, the delay was
small - s281).
<P>
[ed: The district plan was prepared under the Town and Country Planning Act 1977 which did
not contain significant references to Maori values and the Treaty of Waitangi as does the
RMA. Consequently, Maori values could not have been extensively taken into account in the
preparation of that plan. This decision therefore potentially affects all areas where old district
plans remain and have not been reviewed or replaced. 
<P>
George McMillan has been appointed by the Crown to negotiate with the incorporation over
protection of the forest. No deadline has been set for those negotiations (<EM>Replies
Supplement</EM> 12 July 1994 p80).]
<P>
<H3>Simon Luxton & Ors v Bay of Plenty Regional Council & J Wirepa</H3>
<EM>A49/94, 14 June 1994, Sheppard J, commissioners IG McIntyre, F Easdale</EM><P>
Mr Wirepa applied to the regional council for consents to establish a paua farm. He consulted
with, and obtained letters of support from, local Maori groups. Consents were issued by the
council. Appeals against the consents were lodged by Maori persons in the district. These
appeals were sent directly to the Registrar of the Planning Tribunal and were not notified to
Mr
Wirepa or the regional council. Mr Wirepa applied to have the appeals struck out.
<P>
Held: the appeals should be struck out. The RMA only allows the time for service to be
waived
when service has occurred late, not when it has not occurred at all. In any event, the RMA
would not allow service to be given now because Mr Wirepa had spent considerable sums on
the understanding that there were no appeals and would therefore be prejudicially affected
(s281).
<P>
It was accepted that the appellants failure to serve their appeal was a result of "muddlement".
They lived in a remote locality, but could have obtained advice by telephone. The Registrar
had
written to the appellants advising them of the need to serve their appeals, but had received no
response.
<P>
The appellants were concerned about whether Mr Wirepa had backing from the appropriate
tribal authorities, his claimed interests along with his whanau as tangata whenua, possible
control of the paua farm by "undesirable elements" and the omission to consult "outside a
formal confrontational situation". These were not matters the tribunal could consider. The
tribunal would "avoid, if possible, making any findings about the status of a particular tribal
authority, or about the scope of a whanau's rights as tangata whenua, or about which hapu
might have traditional or customary interests in a particular area. Questions of "undesirable
elements" could also not be considered. "It is the law that any person is entitled to apply for
resource consents. .... an appeal against a grant of resource consent has to be decided on
whether the proposal will promote the sustainable management of natural and physical
resources, not on whether it might involve Maori failing to observe customary areas of interest
of a particular whanau, hapu or iwi." 
<P>
Regarding costs, it was noted that most of the proposed appellants were unemployed.
However, this was not the tribunal's concern, and Mr Wirepa had incurred legal expenses in
answering the appeals. The appellants should therefore make a contribution to costs.
[ed: the "muddlement" and unexpected costs in this case might have been avoided had an iwi
management plan existed in the region. Such plans must be taken into account by territorial
authorities (see s61(2)(a)(ii), s66(2)(b)(ii) and s74(2)(b)(ii)). They also provide at an early
stage the wider consultation the appellants thought was needed in this case. 
Procedures for the service of notices are strict under the RMA because of the legal and
financial implications of appeals. These procedures may not be helpful to those living in
remote
localities without money or legal advice (who may often be Maori). Perhaps an amendment is
needed requiring that all reasonable assistance be given by persons such as the Registrar on
receiving appeal notices (in this case by passing a copy of the notice on to the regional council
and asking them to further advise the objectors of the need to formally serve their objection on
the council and Mr Wirepa). The Official Information Act contains a requirement for
reasonable assistance to be given. The general procedure of the Waitangi Tribunal and the
Maori Land Court is to give all reasonable assistance.]
<P>
<H3>Ngati Kahu Trust Board v Northland Regional Council & Lewis Lands Ltd</H3>
<EM>A48/94, 23 June 1994, Sheppard J</EM><P>
Lewis Lands applied for 2 resource consents for the taking and discharge of water for a camp
ground. The board lodged a submission objecting to the applications, but withdrawn that
submission after receiving written assurances about the location of the wastewater discharge,
and restrictions on access by campers to sensitive sand dune and coastal areas (waahi tapu and
rare species were present). The regional council accordingly issued the resource consents
without a hearing. The consents included the board's condition about the location of the
discharge. The board became concerned that the assurances about access by campers were not
being upheld, and lodged an appeal to the tribunal against the regional council decision to
issue
the consents, asking that the tribunal make it a condition of the consents that access be
restricted to the sand dune and coastal areas.
<P>
Held: the appeal should be dismissed. The consents given by the council related to water use
and not access. Consequently, the tribunal could only look to the part of the agreement
between the board and Lewis Lands which related to water use. The board withdrew its
objection on the basis of an assurance about the location of the wastewater discharge. It
thereby lost standing to appeal against the consents. Submitters should not in any event be
able
to cancel their withdrawal once the period for submissions has closed and a resource consent
has been issued (the tribunal on appeal would be put in the situation of conducting a primary
hearing).
<P>
A separate letter to the council from the board, stating that it did not wish to be heard, but
reserving the right to appeal any decision of the council, was ineffective. The agreement with
Lewis Lands contained no such reservation or qualification.
<P>
The intended appeal was also 'vexatious' because it would require the council and Lewis Lands
to answer water discharge issues that had already been settled, and there would be no practical
result from the hearing. 
<P>
The fact that the board was currently the subject of a winding-up order did not preclude it
from
continuing proceedings under the RMA.
<P>
<H2><HR>General</H2>
<H3>Reserves under negotiation</H3>
<EM>Replies Supplement 19 July 1994</EM><P>
The Minister in Charge of Treaty negotiations advised the following as current proposals to
transfer ownership of reserves to Maori as part resolution of Treaty claims: Woodend
lagoon/Tutaepatu Wildlife Management Reserve, Waikuku Beach/Karikari Recreation
Reserve,
and Crown Titi Islands in Ngai Tahu. Oke Bay (Hauai) Scenic Reserve in a northern Maori
group (see Reserve and Other Lands Disposal Bill No 2). There is a proposal for joint
management of Codfish Island/Whenua Hou Nature Reserve between the Crown and Ngai
Tahu. These and any future proposals (others are under discussion) have been and will be
subject to a process of public consultation determined on a case by case basis.
<H3>Australian Native Title Tribunal</H3>
<EM>Aboriginal Law Bulletin June 1994</EM><P>
As at 30 May 1994 the National Native Title Tribunal had received 21 applications for
determination of native title. Seventeen had been "accepted" - that is, they were of sufficient
particularity and prima facie value to be considered by the tribunal. Four remain "under
assessment".

<H2><HR>Customary Use and Conservation</H2>
A debate is currently taking place between the Department of Conservation and Non
Government Organisations (NGOs) about wildlife, the meaning of "conservation" and Treaty
of Waitangi obligations. 
<P>
The Conservation Act, which came into force in April 1987, was designed to promote the
conservation of NZ's natural and historic resources. "Conservation", in the Act, is defined as
"the preservation and protection of natural and historic resources for the purpose of
maintaining their intrinsic values, providing for their appreciation and recreational enjoyment
by the public, and safeguarding the options of future generations." Section 4 requires the
department to give effect to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. One interpretation is that
this requires the Crown to allow iwi continued rights of access to their taonga, including
continued customary usage.
<P>
Some NGOs are concerned about section 4, believing that it should not allow continued taking
of endangered species, particularly birds like the kereru (wood pigeon), toroa (albatross) and
titi (mutton bird). They point out that the Conservation Act does not mention sustainable use.
It
is said that the words "preservation and protection" do not envisage the killing of wildlife.
However, the Wildlife Act 1953, also administered by the department, already allows for some
native species to be hunted or killed. Protected species may be taken for authorised purposes,
including traditional and cultural uses. The harvesting of some bird species on off-shore islands
is permitted, for example, by descendants of the tangata whenua of the islands.
<P>
This duality is in line with the current international approach.  In June 1992 over 150
countries,
including NZ, signed the Biological Diversity Convention which was developed under the
Auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Its objectives are the
conservation of biological diversity (which includes species and their habitats, and ecosystems)
and the sustainable use of these component parts. Particularly relevant to the customary use
debate is article 10(c) which requires countries party to the convention to "protect and
encourage customary uses of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural
practices that are compatible with conservation or sustainable use requirements." NZ ratified
this convention in September 1993.
<P>
Internationally, therefore, customary uses - rather than being seen as a threat to a
preservationist ideal - are, within an overall scheme of conservation, positively encouraged.

<H3>Waihi Kahakaharoa 1Z2B2B block</H3>
<EM>14 Aotea ACMB 38, 1 August 1994. Hingston J, Carter J, Isaac J
</EM><P>
An appeal against a decision dismissing a partition application, in part because the court found
the land had spiritual and cultural significance to the hapu, being untouched since its original
partition.
<P>
Held: the appeal should be disallowed. Partitions are to be refused if the court is of the opinion
that they are "inexpedient" in the interest of the public, owners or other persons interested in
the land (s174/1953). In approaching s174:
<P>
-  the court should go beyond the strict wording and take an overview of the partition sought;
<BR>
- partition is not an automatic right for a shareholder, but a discretion of the court;
<BR>
- the court may adopt an inquisitorial approach taking account of all relevant factors;
<BR>
- s174 is to be read disjunctively. Inexpediency for one of the 3 groups mentioned is enough to
refuse an order;
<BR>
- inexpediency for one group ipso facto must be inexpedient in the overall interest of all
owners.
<BR>
(See <EM>In Re Manawatu-Kukutauaki</EM> (1981) 13 Whanganui ACMB 76, <EM>In
Re Motukawa</EM> (1981) 13 Whanganui ACMB 20, <EM>Part Kaikoura No 4</EM>
1993 Waiariki ACMB 10).
<P>
The Appellate Court will intervene only where the lower court has decided upon a wrong
principle or taken into account an irrelevant consideration, given the wrong weight to relevant
considerations, or if there would be injustice if the Appellate Court did not intervene
(<EM>Re
Tarawera C6</EM> (1982) 9 Takitimu ACMB 286, <EM>Re Kairakau 2C5B, Kapiti
Farm</EM> 10 Takitimu ACMB 64, <EM>Part Kaikoura No 4</EM> 1992 1 Waiariki
Appellate MB 10). None of these grounds had been made out on the appeal.
<P>
On an application to introduce further evidence in the appeal, <EM>In re Whareongaonga 5
and Skuse</EM> [1973] 30 Gisborne ACMB 158 (<EM>Tai Whati</EM> p167) establishes
that evidence can be introduced which 1) could not have been obtained with reasonable
diligence at the trial, 2) would have an important influence on the case, 3) was not
controversial as to the belief which might be placed in it.
<P>[ed: Te Ture Whenua Maori s288/1993 sets out specific criteria to be considered by the
court before approving partitions, including the opinion of the owners as a whole, the effect of
the proposal on the interests of the owners, the best overall use and development of the land.
Sufficient notice must be given and there must be a sufficient degree of support for the
application among the owners, having regard to the nature and importance of the matter. The
court must also be satisfied that the partition is necessary to facilitate the effective operation,
development, and utilisation of the land. The Explanatory Note on the Bill as introduced in
1987 (this clause was not significantly amended) stated that the new provisions follow the
approach of the <EM>Motukawa</EM> case]
<P>
<H3>Tuaropaki E block</H3>
<EM>66 Taupo MB 156, 13 July 1994, Hingston J</EM><P>
Under the Geothermal Energy Act 1953 the Crown had in the 1980s entered onto this block
and, without granting compensation (none being required by the Act), drilled 5 bores for the
investigation of geothermal energy. Application was now made under s18(1)(a)/1993 for a
determination of ownership of the bores and associated well-head structures.
<P>
Held: the court had jurisdiction to determine the issue under s18 (a re-enactment of
s30(1)(a)/1953). Since 1982 an amendment to s30(1)(a)/1953 provided that the court should
determine disputes in respect of Maori freehold land irrespective of ethnic origin of the parties.
The Geothermal Energy Act and associated regulations had not created a statutory profit a
prendre as contended, but instead envisaged that any investigation of geothermal potential
would be followed by a decision whether to take the land. No decision had been made to take
or vacate after the exploratory work, accordingly the Crown's continued involvement with the
wells might be ultra vires or at least a trespass. Section 354(1) RMA (Crown's existing rights
to
continue) merely preserved rights and did not create them. Common law rules regarding
fixtures to land had not been overridden by statute. The bores and well-head structures were
fixtures and therefore part of the land and owned by Tuaropaki E block.
<P>
The court expressed disquiet at being told not to proceed with this matter as legislation was
intended to confirm Crown ownership.
<P>[ed: The Finance (No 2 Bill) Part VI Geothermal Wells Vesting and Empowering is
intended to confirm Crown ownership of these wells without compensation to landowners.
Submissions have closed on the bill and the Government Administration Select Committee is
preparing its report. Several commentators have questioned the constitutional appropriateness
of the bill (<EM>The Independent</EM> 29 July, 19 August 1994). Approximately 120 wells
are affected in the geothermal fields at Whakatane, Te Kopia, Waiotapu, Tauhara, Ruahine,
Reporoa, Rotokawa, Ngawha, Orakeikorako, Ngatamariki, Mokai, Mangakino, Atiamuri,
Horohoro, and Kawerau (2nd Schedule)]
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Sir Graham Latimer and Others re Broadcasting</H3>
<EM>Wai 176, 22 July 1994</EM><P>
The report noted that this claim concerned Crown proposals re broadcasting said to be
contrary
to the Treaty. Many of the issues had been covered in the tribunal <EM>Te Reo Maori</EM>
(Wai 26) and <EM>Radio Frequencies</EM> (Wai 150) reports. The issues had also been
litigated in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Privy Council. Accordingly unless the
claimants indicate otherwise, the tribunal will not make further inquiry into the claim. 
<P>
<H3>Waitangi Tribunal and Maori Land Court Budgets 1994-5</H3>
<EM>Replies Supplement 2 August 1994</EM><P>
The tribunal budget is $3,408,000 comprised of research ($1,402,000), administration
($743,000), hearing costs and members fees ($962,000), specialist advisory and information
services ($301,000). This is an increase of $862,000 over the previous financial year. The
Maori Land Court budget is $6,630,00 including $200,000 to cater for s30/1993 hearings
(power to determine appropriate representatives of a group for any proceedings or
negotiations).
<P>
<H2><HR>Other Jurisdictions</H2>
<H3>Auckland Casino Ltd v Casino Control Authority & Ors
</H3>
<EM>M81/94, 13 July 1994, Robertson J</EM><P>
An application for judicial review of the decision of the Casino Control Authority to grant a
licence to a company (STCL) in preference to other applicants, including Auckland Casino Ltd
(ACL), a company half-owned by Aohou Ltd in trust for the Maori Congress and its iwi
members, and half-owned by a Hong Kong based subsidiary of a multi-national conglomerate.
Held: dismissing the application, that most of the allegations concerned apparent (not actual)
bias, and none of these had been made out. Of particular interest: ACL had waived the right to
object because they failed to object during the hearing when they had knowledge of matters
now put forward as evidence of bias. The argument of ACL that they could not have objected
at the hearing without undertaking consultation as required by tikanga Maori was not
supported
by "one skerrick of material". However the court agreed that because the Treaty partnership is
part of the "philosophical and cultural core" of NZ, courts should endeavour to interpret
activity so that recognition is given to the Treaty, and might reach a different conclusion in
cases where, because of tikanga Maori, a response was not forthcoming from Maori which
might otherwise have been expected.
<P>
In response to various allegations that apparent bias existed because the authority
inappropriately dealt with Maori witnesses and issues, it was found:
<RB>
- the lack of a Maori person on the authority was a statutory matter and not one for court
review;
<BR>
- the Maori Language Act 1987 applied to the proceedings. Section 2 providing that bodies
with the powers of a Commission of Inquiry are subject to the Act, and this was a matter "of
particular interest to the Maori people" because of Maori involvement in the ACL bid.
<BR>
- there was however no evidence that any witness "triggered" the Act by seeking to present
evidence in Maori requiring translation;
<BR>
- failure to meet the requirements of the Act might be an error in law rather than evidence of
bias;
<BR>
- the authority had sought to accommodate ACL in the presentation of their case, and any
breach of protocol was innocent.
<P>
[ed: while many of the grounds in this application do seem to have been, as the court put it,
"post hoc rationalisations" by the disappointed applicant, the finding that "there was no
occasion on which there was evidence presented in Maori which required translation" followed
by the admission that Maori was used "in areas of formal Maori protocol" suggest that the
authority may have missed entirely the significance of any Maori greetings. Surely any
authority making a determination with significant legal consequences should ensure that it has
the means to understand all that is said before it?]
<P>
<H3>Panekiri Tribal Trust v Wairoa District Council & Bay Kayaks Ltd</H3>
<EM>W62/94, 25 July 1994, Kenderdine J</EM><P>
The trust sought to appeal out of time against a consent given to operate a kayaking business
on
Lake Waikaremoana.
<P>
Held: the appellants had failed to comply with any of the requirements of notice of an appeal
under s121/1991. As to allegations re lack of consultation, the council had been "exemplary"
in
its approach. Members of the trust had been at consultation meetings, making this aspect of
the
proposed appeal almost vexatious. Procedures for issuing notices might seem complicated, but
are in the same legislation from which Treaty references were quoted by the trust.
<P>
<H3>Whakarewarewa Village Charitable Trust v Rotorua District 
Council</H3>
<EM>W61/94, 25 July 1994, Kenderdine J & commissioners J Rowan, F Easdale
</EM><P>
An appeal against the Rotorua District Council for refusing land use consents to the
Whakarewarewa Village Charitable Trust for the marketing of tourist items from 9 of 89 lots
in
the Whakarewarewa village. One million tourists visit the area each year. Houses had been
erected on the lots in 1988-89 as part of a scheme to have people seen making crafts in their
residences. To provide funding, leases over the lots were mortgaged to the Housing
Corporation. The scheme was now in financial strife. It was proposed to sell items directly
from the houses. This was said to be the continuation of a commercial tradition from the early
days of tourism.
<P>
Other families in the village objected that it had not been envisaged that sales would occur
from
the houses or that monies from retail sales would not be shared. The council considered the
proposal under a special residential zone of its existing and proposed plans, allowing for the
creation of crafts in houses where this was incidental to residential use, but not sale from
houses. Officers of the council fully consulted with the villagers before the application was
heard and rejected.
<P>
Held: allowing the appeal and the sale of crafts, but with conditions, the tribunal reviewed
briefly the traditional history of the geothermal area, the advent of tourism, including the
acquisition by the Crown of much of the valley in 1896.
<P>
Kaitiakitanga properly required control of the village to be vested in an iwi authority. Since
this
had not occurred, others (the council) had to assume that role to balance the demands of
different groups. Until an iwi authority was formed village development would be subject to
an
examination of the commercial minutiae of proposals. Noted that kaitiakitanga is broader than
a
focus purely on economic viability needed to sustain a development. In the long term a formal
plan would be needed for managing and preserving the resources of the village.
<P>
The Treaty envisaged a share for Maori in the commercial development of the country and a
right to develop their own resources. Article II includes the right to use, manage and dispose
of
property and make profit by common agreement, but not the right to be protected from any
commercially perceived risk. Planning law has merely to ensure that commercialism is
managed
at a sustainable rate, avoiding, remedying or mitigating adverse effects.
<P>
Each proposal was considered in detail, the tribunal noting that it could not consider
commercial viability, including competition from other like businesses. Nor could it consider
the objection that returns would go to individuals rather than the village as a whole. It sought
only to mitigate the "adverse commercial effect" on the social fabric of the village which might
arise if the craft outlets became merely a series of souvenir shops with little or no input from
indigenous craft-makers of the village or elsewhere. Accordingly, retailing was to be limited to
traditional craft (with 2 minor exceptions).
<P>
Regarding consultation, councils (not applicants) are required to undertake consultation with
Maori prior to hearing applications for resource consents, but only through council officers, so
that the hearing of consents by council in its quasi-judicial capacity is not compromised.
<EM>Quarantine Wastes (NZ) Ltd</EM> CP 306/93 followed. The <EM>Gill</EM>
decision [1993] 2 NZRMA 604 did not intend to suggest otherwise when it said that the
"council" needed to consult prior to hearing a resource consent. This might not necessarily
apply to consultation by councils in relation to duties under s32 (duty to consider alternatives
etc before adopting objectives, policies, rules etc) prior to notifying a plan change or new plan.
As to whether greater weight should be given to existing plans as opposed to proposed plans
under the RMA, in cases such as this a "pragmatic approach" should be adopted in view of the
significant Maori concepts such as kaitiakitanga and the promotion of Treaty principles in the
RMA (<EM>JJ Hanton and others v Auckland City Council</EM> A10/94, 1, 33-34
followed).
<P>
Regarding the ability of a local authority to transfer functions (including the hearing and
granting of resource consents) to an iwi authority (s33/1991): here the council, having made a
decision on the resource consent application, had no residual ability to refer the matter to an
iwi
authority. Section 290(1) (Planning Tribunal on appeal to have the same powers and
discretions as the original decider), might allow referral of a matter to an iwi authority under
s33. But earlier decisions have shown that the tribunal will only grant the relief expressly
sought or contemplated by appellants, and the appellants here did not contemplate in their
appeal the implementation of an iwi management plan. The tribunal might not decide of its
own accord to initiate an iwi development plan, as this did not generally fall within its function
as an appellate authority. A fresh application would be required.
<P>
The tribunal noted with concern, but could not itself consider, the possibility that, as financial
arrangements now stood, leases of the lots might be forfeited to occupiers with no traditional
ties with the village. This would "seriously erode" the cultural character of the village.
<P>
[ed: this decision shows that if provisions under the RMA for iwi management plans are not
taken advantage of, iwi can find planning authorities and the tribunal controlling the minutiae
of their lives. One decision of the tribunal in this case was that a particular lot could sell
walking sticks of wood, but not plastic! Not surprisingly, the tribunal thought this a prime case
for iwi to plan and manage their own affairs within the district plan. In the meantime, they face
the ignominy of the local authority performing the role of kaitiaki for their village. The
comments clarifying consultation requirements will be welcomed by councils]
<P>
<H3>Tauranga District Council v Toa Haere Faulkner & Another</H3>
<EM>Plt No 1110/93, 15 August 1994, IB Thomas J</EM><P>
A claim for payment of rates in respect of Maori freehold property. The defendant replied that
the land remained customary land under Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 (whose definition
differs from that under the 1953 Act); alternatively that, historically, the Maori Land Court
with regard to this block had merely passed on by its succession orders an unextinguished
customary title.
<P>
Held: that these defences were estopped by an earlier decision of the MLC assuming this block
was Maori freehold land. The 1953 definition was in force when the rating orders were
sought.
The MLC had dealt with the land as Maori freehold land since 1921.

<H3>Discussion Material on Allocation Models for Consultation with Iwi</H3>
<EM>Te Ohu Kai Moana - Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, August
1994</EM><P>
Sets out 3 models for allocation to iwi of pre-settlement fisheries assets, including over 57,000
tonnes of quota. The models are 1) Manamoana (proportion of the Total Allowable Catch
occurring off-shore from landward boundaries of each iwi at 1840), Population, Progressive
Allocation (staged allocation using the manamoana approach). The model finally chosen must
be consistent with tikanga Maori, with legislation, meet social and economic needs, be
financially viable, technically feasible and politically sustainable. After consultation, Te Ohu
Kaimoana will, later in the year, recommend a model (with or without unanimous iwi support)
to the Government, which will have 30 days to respond with any changes.
<P>
Each model incorporates a common process for registration of iwi and resolving disputes
among iwi about their respective allocations. The manamoana and progressive allocation
models would use 1840 as the date when an iwi coastline is determined, but the commission
recognises that "some flexibility" might be required in its application.
<P>
[ed: the preferred model of Te Ohu Kai Moana is manamoana. For each model, except the
population model, the origin of the model in the Treaty and Waitangi Tribunal reports is
discussed. This is significant since the first criteria for selection of a model is its accord with
"tikanga Maori". The procedures for registering iwi revive elements of the repealed Runanga
Iwi Act. The dispute resolution process, when applied to the manamoana model, might see the
commission acting in some respects as the land court did last century, applying an '1840 rule'.]

<H3>Keynote Address to Hui Whakapumau - Maori Development Conference</H3>
<EM>Chief Judge ET Durie, 10 August 1994</EM><P>
In this hard hitting speech commenting on the decade of Maori development since the Maori
Economic Development Summit of 1984, the Chief Judge noted that, on the basis of human
rights and Treaty jurisprudence, a compelling case exists for an independent and adequately
funded Maori agency to formulate Maori policy and development proposals. A proposal in
1985 that a largely independent Maori body replace the then Department of Maori Affairs was
rejected by Cabinet. This compared unfavourably with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Commission created around the same time with extensive aboriginal representation
and
with Canadian efforts at tribal self government. Consequently, Maori now face a proliferation
of competing organisations in districts, rivalry between districts and the unilateral development
of a claims resolution policy by government with no significant Maori input. Lack of funding
for solutions generated by Maori reflects disturbing elements of the colonial era. Lack of an
independent body answerable to Maori means current Ministry of Maori Development policy
is
state policy, no matter how benign. Consultation by the state is insufficient in that it elicits a
response but denies Maori initiative. Important positions in Maori policy formation, including
positions in the Maori Land Court and Waitangi Tribunal, are filled by state nominees
according to criteria the State judges to be important.
<P>
<H3>Maori and the Law in the Light of the Life, Works and Legacy of Sir Apirana
Ngata</H3>
<EM>Chief Judge ET Durie. Opening address on the centenary of the graduation of Sir
Apirana Ngata, University of Canterbury, 24 June 1994.</EM><P>
Ngata's achievements as a lawmaker stemmed from the view that the true art of law is not the
maintenance of prescriptive rules but the delivery of substantive justice. There is a need for
Maori lawyers to develop skills in statutory drafting, parliamentary mechanics and lobbying to
provide the technical expertise to Maori politicians to promote and advance legislation under
the MMP system. 
<P>
Maori jurisprudence needs development. Ngata argued in 1937 against a proposal to vest all
petroleum in the Crown, contending that whether Maori knew about oil in 1840 was
irrelevant.
There is no sound basis in law that rights of indigenous people must be locked into such as
existed at the time of colonisation, although this approach appears to have been followed in
<EM>Tainui Maori Trust Board</EM> [1989] 2 NZLR 513, 527 (Maori knew about coal)
and <EM>Te Runanga o Te Ikawhenua v A-G</EM> CA 124/93 17 December 1993 (Maori
did not know about electricity generation). Ikawhenua claimants might have been better to
have
used Ngata's line, that if they owned the river, they had the right to any development of it.
What is required from Maori lawyers today is not an interpretation of the law but "a vision of
how it should be developed".

<H2><HR>New Zeeland</H2>
A bill sponsored by the Hon Graeme Lee, and currently before a select committee (the Flags,
Anthems, Emblems, and Names Protection Amendment Bill), seeks to ensure that the NZ flag,
and the anthems "God Save the Queen" and "God Defend NZ" (declared in the bill to be
"National Anthems of NZ") shall remain the national symbols, unless 65% of the members of
the House or a majority in a national referendum agree otherwise (Her Majesty retains power
to alter her own anthem however).
<P>
This proposal is in stark contrast to the current discussion about changing the name of New
Zealand to Aotearoa. Some commentators have suggested that "Aotearoa" is not useful
because it is a recent invention. This may be a little academic however since the place of
Aotearoa in common usage seems assured. Many government departments and private
agencies happily use it in their titles. It appears in all new passports. The Maori Language
Commission has sanctioned its use. Thousands of documents produced every day contain it.
Maori elders have been suggesting a name change for some time (most recently at Waitangi
this year - <EM>Mana News</EM> 13 September 1994).
<P>
Perhaps the NZ Geographic Board Act 1946 could be useful here. One of the functions of the
board is to "collect original Maori place names for recording on official maps" (s8(1)(f)). The
current proposal would surely get support from the 2 persons appointed to the board as
"representatives of the Maori race" (s3(2)). Unfortunately, the Board may only consider
altering names to any place in NZ (the title to the Act gives it away). A pity, when another
function of the Board seems particularly suited to this debate, namely s8(1)(e): "To determine
what alien names appearing on official maps should be replaced by Maori or British names".
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>In Re Nuhaka 2E3C8A2B</H3>
<EM>92 Wairoa MB 214, 22 August 1994, Isaac J</EM><P>
This case concerned the new provisions of the 1993 Act requiring that alienating owners give
the first right of refusal to persons belonging to preferred classes of alienees. An application
for
confirmation of an alienation of Maori freehold land was opposed by trustees of an adjoining
block of Maori land who claimed to be members of the preferred class of alienees who had not
been given first right of refusal. The alienating owners questioned whether these persons did
indeed belong to the preferred class.
<P>
Held: that the trustees and the beneficiaries they represented were of the preferred class, being
whanaunga of the alienating owners associated with the land in accordance with tikanga
Maori,
and trustees of such whanaunga (s4(b) & (d)/1993). The reasons being:
<P>
- The court may only rely on the evidence before it, but must also consider the preamble to the
1993 Act, principles for interpreting the Act generally in s2 and general objectives in s17
which
favour retention of land in Maori hands as far as possible.<BR>
- The adjoining trustees and the beneficiaries they represented could whakapapa back to an
ancestor who was common to the owners in the block which was being sold.<BR>
- It did not matter that the common ancestor was some generations removed. "According to
Tikanga Maori, right to land is validated by Whakapapa. The earlier the ancestor the stronger
the right to that land. Land was claimed by Whakapapa because in accordance with Tikanga
Maori all things were derived from the ancestors and were passed on to future generations. If
a
person can Whakapapa to an original owner or occupier of the land that person has a right to
the land. The Whakapapa presented to the Court does not lose strength because it traces back
for generations. In terms of Tikanga Maori it gains strength."<BR>
- The physical association with the land was a tenuous one (taking horses to it, walking across
it
to go to school, picking mushrooms), but tikanga Maori looks beyond a simple physical
association to consider also historical and spiritual links. These links remain despite
partitioning
which has split up the original block. Although the trustees and their beneficiaries may not
have
used the land for many generations, their "inchoate rights" remained by reference to past
association and whakapapa.
<P>
[ed: an important decision, perhaps the first of many, which sets out the principles on which
the court will operate in this difficult area. Most importantly, the court has decided that the
individualisation of title to land in the last 100 years is to some extent in Maori terms an
artificial process, and physical links with a particular small block will not be the key criteria for
membership of the preferred class. There may be implications in this approach for matters
before the Waitangi Tribunal, and Te Ohu Kai Moana, where historic links with resources are
under debate]
<P>
<H3>Waiohau B Section II and Oputea B2 Blocks</H3>
<EM>Tauranga MB 8 September 1994</EM><P>
This decision concerned the extent to which the land court may make orders when no party
before it has applied for the orders made. In the course of disposing of 2 applications affecting
a s438 trust, the court, of its own volition, made an order under s438(3)(a)/1953 replacing
two
existing s438 trustees with the Maori trustee. The jurisdiction to do this was s27(2)/1953
which
provided that in the course of proceedings on any application the court may exercise any other
part of its jurisdiction as it deems necessary. Section 27(2)/1953 has now been replaced by
s37(3)/1993. 
<P>
The order was appealed. The Appellate Court noted that the order had been made without
giving notice, and, with the agreement of the parties, referred the matter back to the lower
court for a rehearing.
<P>
In the course of rehearing, one of the parties requested the court, using its jurisdiction under
s37(3)/1993, to appoint additional trustees. 
<P>
Held: the request should be declined. Section 37(3) provides that further orders may be made
only in the course of proceedings on an application. The rehearing had not arisen from an
application, but from an exercise of the predecessor of s37(3) in the hearing of an earlier
application that was now disposed of. The rehearing was therefore limited to the matter
referred by the Appellate Court, removal of existing trustees and appointment of the Maori
Trustee.
<P>
It was also noted that s438(3)(a)/1953 does not give jurisdiction to the court to remove a
trustee who disputes that removal (<EM>Alexander v Maori Appellate Court & Ors</EM>
[1979] 2 NZLR 44 followed).

A brief judgment which suggests that because the Maori Incorporations Constitution
Regulations 1994 take effect from 1 June 1994, applications for appointment to committees of
management filed prior to this date should follow the old procedure under s52(4)/1967. That
procedure requires the forwarding of nominations to the court for it to make the appointment
(the 1993 Act and new regulations do not require application to the court. See s269(5) &
s284(2)(l)/1993 and cl 22-23/1994)

<H3>Te Maunga Railways Land Report</H3>
<EM>Wai 315. August 1994. Judge HK Hingston, P Ringwood, E Stokes, M
Temara</EM><P>
This is a report of an urgent hearing concerning the offer back to the original Maori owners of
6070 square metres of Maori freehold land known as Te Maunga railway land. The land was
taken in 1955 for railway purposes under the Public Works Act 1928 and used for housing for
railway employees.
<P>
Nga Potiki hapu of Ngai Te Rangi owned lands at Mt Maunganui which were confiscated
under the NZ Settlements Act 1863 and their customary title extinguished. Several blocks
were
returned as Maori freehold land. The Te Maunga land was part of one of these blocks, the
Papamoa block. From 1913-61 various takings occurred in the Papamoa No 2 block for
railway related purposes including the taking of the Te Maunga land in 1955.
<P>
Negotiations for the taking were undertaken with only 3 shareholders (holding 56%) out of 22
shareholders in the land. Compensation was assessed by the Maori Land Court and paid in the
normal manner. The evidence suggests the owners would have perceived the taking was
compulsory and a matter out of their control (there had been other takings in the area at the
time), ie they were not willing sellers. Crown policy in such situations was for taking the
freehold title. Accordingly, options such as leasing, which would have preserved the parent
title
in Maori hands, were not considered.
<P>
In 1985 Railways sought to dispose of the land. Section 40(1) Public Works Act 1981 and s23
NZ Railways Corporation Restructuring Act 1990 required the land be offered back to the
original owners unless it was impractical, unreasonable or unfair to do so or there had been a
significant change in the character of the land. After failing to get consent to create a
subdivision, Railways entered negotiations with a Maori incorporation owning adjoining land,
but did not, as the law required, seek to identify the former owners or make a formal offer
back to them. 
<P>
In 1991 Railways entered a sale and purchase agreement with a local businessman conditional
on "offer back" procedures being satisfied. The businessman began construction of a concrete
plant on the land. Another local businessman began negotiations for a lease over part of the
land. Railways eventually made an application under s436 Maori Affairs Act 1953 to the
Maori
Land Court for it to determine in whom the land should now be vested. The court in 1993
made an order vesting the land in the original owners but conditional on payment of the
market
value of $70,000 within 4 months (the court commented in a preliminary determination that,
because of the Treaty, Maori owners ought to be given preferential treatment in offer back
situations, possibly by deferred payment over a reasonable period of the market price). The
former owners objected to the condition and sought an urgent hearing before the Waitangi
Tribunal.
<P>
The tribunal considered briefly the history of public works legislation in NZ, noting there has
been no specific reference to Crown obligations under the Treaty in this legislation. It was also
noted with regard to valuation that, for Maori, land has distinctive values. 
<P>
There was no suggestion made that Maori land should not be used for the public benefit where
required. But problems arise where the freehold is taken when something less would suffice.
The land was also taken from unwilling sellers. It is inherent in the fiduciary obligation of the
Crown under the Treaty that when it uses its discretion to offer back land, it should use it
positively, and the full market price should not be required if this would prevent Maori having
their ancestral land returned. Comments in the Court of Appeal in <EM>NZ Maori Council v
A-G</EM> [1987] 1 NZLR 664 re fiduciary duty were considered and also comments re
compulsory acquisition in Waitangi Tribunal <EM>Orakei, Mangonui Sewage, Ngati
Rangiteaorere</EM> and <EM>Mohaka River</EM> reports.
<P>
Compulsory acquisition of Maori land raises the issue of whether kawanatanga (Article 1)
overrides the guarantee of tino rangatiratanga (Article 2). In exercising its discretions to take
land and to return it when no longer required, the Crown should be guided by its fiduciary
obligations as a Treaty partner. These obligations override normal national and commercial
considerations. The obligation in respect of return may be greater than previously because so
little land remains in Maori ownership. The Privy Council in <EM>NZ Maori Council v
A-G</EM> Appeal 14/1993 spoke of "especially vigorous action" being required for the
protection of vulnerable taonga. Consequently, where a taking is necessary (kawanatanga
permits the Crown to seek the use of the land for the public benefit), a more consultative
approach to negotiation is required which acknowledges Maori rangatiratanga, and does not
extinguish Maori title.
<P>
In this case the taking of the land did not involve willing sellers. A Crown submission that the
taking by proclamation was a matter of convenience was rejected. Offer back provisions place
the onus on the Crown to find the former owners. Railways confused the issue by failing to do
this and by agreeing to a sale to a third party. Nga Potiki have had other lands in the area
taken
for public works. This taking, although small, should be considered in that context. The
Crown
has exercised its discretion to have other compulsorily acquired land in the area returned at a
lower than market price. Offerback procedures need to be streamlined. Costs were high in this
case because of inept handling by Railways officials. This was an appropriate situation for the
Crown to exercise a discretion and return the land at no cost, without prejudice to other public
works takings. 
<P>
The tribunal recommended:
<BR>
- That the Crown revest the land, at no cost, in the former owners
<RB>
- That a moratorium be imposed on all dealings with lands compulsorily acquired from Maori
and no longer required, until legislation is in place to return these to Maori
<BR.
- That the Public Works Act 1981 and other relevant legislation be amended to provide that all
persons exercising functions and powers under the Act, act in a manner consistent with the
Treaty
- Where Maori land is required for public works a partial interest only be taken and not the
freehold
<BR>
- When land is no longer required the Crown should be given discretion to negotiate in each
case the return at no cost, or less than market value
- Where negotiations fail, the Maori Land Court should decide what compensation should be
paid on the basis of a fair return to Maori for the use of the land by the Crown. Where Maori
might owe compensation, this would be a charge on the land.
<P>
[ed: although concerning a small area, the report has major implications. In effect, it suggests
all public works takings of Maori land be treated as if they were leases when an offer back is
required. Hundreds of sites may be affected. The tribunal recorded, but presumably did not
agree with, suggestions in the <EM>Mangonui Sewage</EM> and <EM>Orakei</EM>
reports that the Treaty may forbid compulsory acquisition in any situation. In another report
released this month (<EM>Environmental Information and the Adequacy of Treaty Settlement
Procedures</EM> - reviewed below) the comment is made that the Crown has not decided
whether the Takapourewa (Stephen's Island) claim, involving a public works taking, is valid,
and this is stalling negotiations. This report may give some idea of how the tribunal might view
the Takapourewa claim if it is called to report on it. A political factor: the report mentions that
the Hon Peter Tapsell has actively intervened on several occasions for the Nga Potiki people
in
efforts to secure the return of this and other compulsorily acquired lands]
<P>
<H2><HR>Other jurisdictions</H2>
<H3>The Maori Trustee v Rogross Farms Ltd and Another</H3>
<EM>CA 175/91. 7 September 1994. Cooke, Casey, Tipping</EM><P>
The Maori Trustee sued a lessee, Rogross, for breach of covenant in returning land at the end
of a lease in poor condition. The lower court held that there had been a breach, but that,
because the court did not consider that the trustee had suffered any actual loss (the land had
been leased again without difficulty), awarded only nominal damages ($10). The rule in the
English case of <EM>Joyner v Weeks</EM> [1891] 2 QB 31 CA was held not to apply in
NZ. This would have required the lessee to pay the sum (in this case $19,570) needed to leave
the land in the condition anticipated by the covenants.
<P>
Held: that the rule of <EM>Joyner v Weeks</EM> applies in NZ as a prima facie measure of
loss unless the lessee can show by "sufficiently cogent evidence" that in both the short and
long
term the lessor will definitely suffer no loss or a loss that can definitely be assessed at less than
the prima facie measure. The evidence in this case did not suggest the prima facie measure
should not apply. Accordingly the trustee was entitled to $19,570 damages.
Other cases dealing with breach of covenant and assessment of damages which used a different
approach (<EM>Maori Trustee v Bjerring</EM> (1960) 1 NZCPR 565 <EM>Maori Trustee
v Bolton</EM> [1971] 1 NZLR 226 and <EM>Maori Trustee v Clark</EM> [1984] 1 NZLR
578) were distinguishable either because the lessee was entitled to compensation for
improvements (<EM>Bolton</EM> and <EM>Clark</EM>) or the covenants were
impossible to perform (<EM>Bjerring</EM>).
<P>
[ed: the Court of Appeal noted that this case concerned an issue of considerable importance to
those who own and lease farmland. Maori are particularly affected, as the names of the
previous cases suggest]
<P>
<H2><HR>General</H2>
<H3>Environmental Information and the Adequacy of Treaty Settlement Procedures</H3>
<EM>Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. September
1994</EM><P>
 This report was prepared in response to concerns expressed to the commissioner and through
the media that negotiations to settle Treaty claims are failing to address environmental issues.
The report examines how far procedures for settling claims ensure that adequate information
on environmental matters is available to those involved. The concern of the commissioner is
the
protection of environmental values, not whether the Crown or Maori can best ensure that the
quality of the environment will be maintained. 
<P>
Procedures for settling Treaty claims are evolving and those involved may not have full
information about the environmental implications (in the broadest sense) of settlement options.
The report looks at the settlement process in relation to Crown owned lands under the
Conservation Act 1987, Reserves Act 1977, Wildlife Act 1953 and Land Act 1948. Useful
tables are included showing consultation requirements under these Acts.
<P>
The major options of settlements in relation to the environment are;  a change in the managers,
change of ownership, change of use, or compensation. The report looks at 3 case studies:
Takapourewa (Stephen's Island), Tutae Patu lagoon and pastoral lands (Routeburn,
Greenstone, Elfin Bay) purchased for settlement of the Ngai Tahu claim.
<P>
There is confusion about different parts of the process - particularly the difference between
negotiation and consultation and that the public provide information but are not negotiating
with Maori. There is also confusion about the different functions of government departments
and ministers, and conflicts for ministers between advocacy for their departments and their
role
as negotiators.
<P>
Adequate environmental information (including information about possible social implications)
at an early stage would assist negotiations and settlements, for example by allowing for the
identification of other affected Maori groups, and the future effect of conditions which might
be placed on settlements. The public at large have no general entitlement to be consulted
except
where provided in statutes, although the potential exists for an argument for involvement
because of a "legitimate expectation". It would have to be shown that there was an express or
implied undertaking to consult either through Crown statements or because of the status of the
group or the existence of a tradition of consultation.
<P>
In 2 of the case examples public consultation had come, by accident rather than design,
through government requests for input from conservation boards, who had in turn sought
public submissions.
<P>
In British Columbia an independent Treaty Commission has been established which structures
negotiations through distinct stages and ensures at each stage that parties are properly
prepared,
and have adequate information, including on the government side, through consultation  with
third parties. The BC government has established a Treaty Negotiation Advisory Committee
to
advise it including business and environmental groups. Such a commission would be useful in
NZ to clarify the roles of parties, and would increase Maori and public confidence in the
process (A background report by Caren Wickliffe on settlements in Australia, United States
and Canada is in production).
<P>
Presently, necessary environmental information is incidental to the process. This is a serious
omission. Consultation required by statutes comes too late - after options have been
considered. The use of Environmental Enhancement and Protection Procedures is advocated
as
part of a systematic attempt to assess environmental implications at the inception of a
settlement proposal when real choices can still be made, including the choice to do nothing.
The Treaty of Waitangi Policy Unit is the appropriate body to ensure this is done, being
responsible for the exercise of a discretion with environmental consequences.
<P>
[ed: The report is concerned about outcomes for the environment. Issues of Crown versus
Maori ownership are secondary to this. As it states, the fundamental problem with information
is to enable the confidential processes of negotiation and mediation to take place alongside the
public and consultative process of planning without prejudice to one another.
<P>
Appendix I is a legal opinion on Crown obligations too consult in negotiations with Maori. It
includes useful discussion of what consultation requires, and when there may be a legal
obligation on government to consult not only with environmental groups, but also other Maori
groups affected by a claim. The suggestion is made that should the "fiscal envelope" policy be
adopted the ability for Maori groups not immediately involved in a settlement to question it
may be legally extended, since any settlement will have an direct impact on the size of
settlements for other groups.
<P>
The report also comments that since the Wildlife Act gives absolute protection to wildlife it
may override the Treaty (see editorial, MLR Aug 1994)]
<P>
<H3>Treaty of Waitangi Policy Unit</H3>
<EM>Press statement 6 September 1994</EM><P>
Cabinet has approved restructuring of the Treaty of Waitangi Policy Unit (TOWPU) into an
Office of Treaty Settlements (OTS). The director of OTS will be accountable directly to the
Minister in Charge of Treaty Negotiations regarding Treaty policy, negotiations and
implementation. OTS will be funded under a separate vote. The Department of Justice will
provide support services, with the Secretary of Justice being responsible to the Minister of
Justice for the financial management, performance and reporting of the unit. The restructuring
will not affect present relationships with Maori groups.
<P>
[ed: No date for the change is given, but the process of appointing a director will begin
"shortly". The restructuring suggests the OTS will be more independent than TOWPU, which
is fully within the Justice Department. However, for the moment the Minister in Charge of
Negotiations remains the Justice Minister, the Hon D Graham]

<H3>Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund Bill 1994</H3>
<EM>Aboriginal Law Bulletin August 1994</EM><P>
The federal House of Representatives is presently considering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Commission Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994.
The bill establishes a corporation with power to buy land for aboriginal groups. Most groups
are not able to bring claims based on common law aboriginal title under the Native Title Act
1993, because the Australian High Court has interpreted that doctrine to require that groups
must demonstrate a continuous association to have a valid claim. Many aboriginal groups were
dispossessed at an early date. 
<P>
The bill provides that around $100 million will be credited each year to a land fund for the
next
ten years. For the first 3 years of its existence, the land corporation will have available around
$20 million to begin purchasing. After this period it will rely on investments made by the land
fund. The corporation is expected to begin work on 1 January 1995.
<P>
Meanwhile, the High Court is hearing 2 actions from Western Australian aboriginal groups
challenging the validity of that state's native title legislation (which is less generous than the
federal legislation), and one action from the Western Australian government challenging the
validity of the federal Native Title Act 1993.
<P>
<H3>Community Safety: Mental Health and Criminal Justice Issues</H3>
<EM>Law Commission report no 30 August 1994</EM><P>
This report considered, in the light of recent serious offending by 2 former psychiatric patients,
whether the Criminal Justice Act 1985 or any other enactment should be amended to confer
extra powers of detention. The commission concluded that community safety did not require
powers of detention beyond those already in mental health legislation. This conclusion was
reached after weighing the community right to be protected against the right not to be
arbitrarily detained. One reason for urging "caution" about any change was the concern that
broader detention powers may have a greater effect on some sectors of the community,
particularly Maori. A submission from Te Puni Kokiri was noted, that more than half of those
placed in psychiatric hospitals by the courts under the Criminal Justice Act 1985 are Maori.
<P>
<H3>Assisted Human Reproduction. Navigating Our Future. Report of the Ministerial
Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technologies</H3>
<EM>July 1994. Bill Atkin, Dr Paparangi Reid</EM><P>
The report deals with all major issues surrounding assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
After considering approaches in other countries, the committee adopted as a basic principle
the
view that all human tissue has mana. Sale of it would therefore be disrespectful. Human tissue
is also tapu and sacred. This includes the products of ART such as embryos and gametes.
They
should be treated with dignity when considering issues surrounding their storage and
ownership. One practical implication of this approach is the suggestion that where a Maori
gamete provider dies, respect for cultural practices might require the burial of that tissue with
the deceased.
<P>
Another principle adopted by the committee was consideration of the partnership in the Treaty
of Waitangi in the development of ART. It was noted that, for Maori, knowledge of
whakapapa is vital and secrecy about genetic origins is antithetical to Maori values and may
conflict with Treaty principles.

<H2><HR>Proposed Maori Electoral Districts 1994</H2>
<H3>Representation Commission</H3>
The Maori seats proposed by the commission, Te Tai Tokerau, Te Tai Hauaru, Te Tai
Rawhiti,
Te Puku O Te Whenua, Te Tai Tonga are based on existing Maori electoral boundaries, the
community of interest among Maori people and members of Maori tribes, communications,
topographical features, projected population changes (these criteria are in the Electoral Act
1993).
Te Puku O Te Whenua district is said to be "a symbolic reference to the centre", and "in spite
of
an apparent diversity of Iwi within this electorate the territorial integrity of each has for the
most
part been accommodated." The Maori electoral population of the Chatham Islands is included
in
Te Tai Tonga. Boundaries go to the limit of the territorial sea to avoid questions regarding
eroded
or accreted or reclaimed areas. Maori members of the Commission are W Gardiner (TPK), J
Brown (government rep), W Wereta (opposition rep). Objections must be received by 21
November 1994. After hearings, the final boundaries are expected to be gazetted on 27 April
1995.
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>Maioro lands</H3>
<EM>Case stated 1990/1, Waikato-Maniapoto ACMB, 12 September 1994. Hingston J,
Carter J, Marumaru J</EM><P>
While hearing a claim concerning Maioro lands on the northern side of the Waikato river
mouth, lodged by a Ngati Te Ata group, the Waitangi Tribunal became aware of a "cross
claim" from a group identified as Ngati Karewa/Ngati Tahinga. The tribunal referred a case
stated to the Maori Appellate Court under s6A Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 to determine
which Maori according to customary law principles of "take" and occupation or use had rights
of ownership in the area, and if more than one, what were the tribal boundaries.
<P>
Held: Although not permanently occupied by any group, Ngati Te Ata held rangatiratanga and
ownership according to customary law over the Maioro lands from 1840 to 1865, when the
lands were Crown granted to Ngati Te Ata. The court rested its analysis on the classic
grounds
of discovery, take tupuna (ancestry), take raupatu (conquest) and take tuku (gift), used in the
past by the court and most recently in <EM>In re Henare Rakiihia Tau & Ngai Tahu Trust
Board </EM>(4
South Island ACMB 673). These principles were applied to whakapapa evidence from the
claimants and historical reports about land dealings prepared by the Crown and Ngati Te Ata
researchers. The case included discussion of kaitiakitanga and its relationship to ownership for
the purpose of determining customary rights. The court was concerned that other hapu of
Tainui might have an interest, but on receiving no submissions from other hapu determined the
ownership in Ngati Te Ata.
<P>
[ed: Judged by this and the Ngai Tahu Trust Board decision, the present land court judges are
happy with the criteria developed by the old Native Land Court when determining customary
issues, although recent research (most notably A Ballara <EM>Origins of Ngati
Kahungunu</EM>) and
comments of the Chief Judge (see below) suggest those criteria may need modification]
<P>
<H3>Section 30 applications update</H3>
<EM>Office of the Chief Judge, 1994</EM><P>
Seven applications received by the Chief Judge under s30(1)(b)/1993 have now been referred
to the Maori Land Court to determine who are the appropriate representatives of Maori
groups
in particular areas for particular purposes. The purposes include consultation under the
Resource Management Act, consultation over sacred sites and traditional fisheries,
negotiations
over Treaty claims settlements, receipt of benefits allocated by the Treaty of Waitangi
Fisheries
Commission. In the North Island, applications are from Whakatohea, Pahauwera, Ngati Paoa,
and Ngati Toarangatira groups (see Ngati Toarangatira Manawhenua case below), and one
from Tararua District Council (seeking to know who to deal with between Kahungunu and
Rangitane groups under the RMA). In the South Island, applications concern representation
for
the Arahura and Mawhera regions of Te Tai Poutini and the region between the Hapuku and
Clarence rivers on the east coast. In two cases, Whakatohea and Ngati Pahauwera, final orders
have now been made. The court did not issue a written judgment giving reasons in each case
but simply issued orders naming the representatives.
<P>
[ed: In comments made when referring these matters to the Maori Land Court, the Chief
Judge
has noted that s30(1)(b) confers a discretionary power and he must act extra judicially in
making referrals, subject to the usual rules of administrative law. Accordingly, his discretion
has been advanced by letters and inquiries (with copies to all parties, and an opportunity to
respond etc) and not by formal memoranda or sittings. The major concerns at this
discretionary
stage have been:
<P>
- Finalising the proposed terms of reference ie for what purposes the representatives shall
act<BR>
- Satisfying the Chief Judge that reasonable steps have been taken to determine representatives
and that these have been unsuccessful (s30(2))<BR>
- Consultation over the skills required of additional members (not nominations) appointed by
the Chief Judge to the court to hear the application (s33(3).]

<H3>Ngati Toarangatira Manawhenua ki te Tau Ihu Trust v Te Runanga o Toa Rangatira Inc
& Maori Land Court</H3>
<EM>CP 228/94, 16 August 1994. Neazor J</EM><P>
Ngati Toa groups had sought a determination by the MLC under s30/1993 as to appropriate
representatives of Toarangatira for the purposes of; receiving certain fisheries quota,
consultation with territorial authorities, and negotiating with the Crown over surplus lands
disposal in the South Island. The plaintiffs challenged, by way of judicial review, a decision of
the MLC setting an early fixture date, arguing that they required further time for preparation. 
Held: the MLC in deciding on a date for hearing is exercising a statutory power affecting
rights
which is amenable to review. The power to fix dates is discretionary however. On the facts of
this case the court had considered all relevant matters and natural justice was not denied by the
court in fixing a date earlier than the plaintiffs desired.
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Maori Tertiary Education claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 431, 23 September 1994. JR Morris</EM><P>
After a conference, the tribunal deferred inquiry into this claim on the basis that the Todd
report on the funding of tertiary education was not yet part of government policy, and it
would
not be possible to determine whether there was any likely prejudice to Maori when total
arrangements as to tertiary funding changes have not yet been decided. Leave was given to
reintroduce the claim if required when a government decision on funding is made (likely before
the end of the year according to Crown counsel), or in 1995 if no decision has been made by
then (at which time an inquiry might focus on the delay).
<P>

<H3>Memorandum re jurisdiction in the Chatham Islands claims</H3>
<EM>Wai 64 & others, 5 October 1994. CJ Durie, Prof G Orr</EM><P>
Counsel for claimants sought a determination that the tribunal could consider, under s6 Treaty
of Waitangi Act 1975, whether the "1840 rule", a judge made rule of the Native Land Court,
was inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, being a rule made by the court
acting by or on behalf of the Crown.
<P>
Held: the tribunal has yet to determine the precise content of the 1840 rule. As to whether the
land court acted on behalf of the Crown, "the Crown" formerly referred to the monarch but
now commonly means the executive government. It does not include Parliament. Past
legislation establishing the land court reflected measures for the general courts which
emphasised the doctrine of the separation of powers. If the land court were found to be part of
the Crown, it would follow that other courts were also the Crown. The Crown when used in
contemporary statutes without other embellishment refers to the executive and not to
Parliament or the courts.
<P>
Arguments that the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, because of the special matters it seeks to
address, might use the term differently, were rejected. It was accepted however that the
tribunal
is not concerned with the legality of actions of the Crown, but whether they are consistent
with
the principles of the Treaty. It is unlikely therefore that the legal sufficiency of Crown actions
alone will necessarily constitute Treaty compliance. Arguments were also rejected that this
matter should be decided by reference to the Treaty itself and "kawanatanga". That word does
not suggest that less than full sovereignty was ceded by Maori, as earlier tribunal reports make
clear. The supremacy, if not the precise nature, of the new governorship was understood. The
tino rangatiratanga retained by Maori was necessarily altered from that of olden times to allow
for the Queen's pre-eminence. Read as a whole the Treaty does not describe a continuing
relationship between sovereign states. 
<P>
It is arguable that since Maori at 1840 were unaware of the separation of powers they may
have viewed any act of the British, including actions of the land court, as acts of the Crown.
Passages in the Te Roroa report suggest this. However, the present issue must be determined
by looking to the intention of the legislature in passing the 1975 Act, not the understanding of
Treaty participants at 1840. It is significant that the 1975 Act specifically provides that the
tribunal may consider statutes, which are not normally considered acts by or on behalf of the
Crown, yet is silent about the courts. Submissions that the NZ Bill of Rights Act 1990 and
international instruments are relevant were rejected.
<P>
Agreeing with comments in the High Court in the <EM>Te Runanga o Wharekauri Rekohu
Inc v
Waitangi Tribunal</EM> (CP M8/94, 12 May 1994), the tribunal may however look at land
court
decisions to see if they are consistent with the Treaty, and where they are inconsistent,
whether
the Crown omitted to take action to remedy the situation. A finding that a decision of the
courts
is inconsistent with the Treaty in no way impugns the legality of the court decision. 
<P>
[ed: many of the arguments of counsel suggested that unless the tribunal could review land
court judgments as Crown actions no remedy would exist for claimants. The tribunal believes
that it may still provide a remedy by reviewing Crown actions pursuant to court decisions. The
tribunal decision is not surprising. In the High Court it was suggested that this would be an
appropriate finding, and a contrary approach may have carried an implication that the tribunal
itself is an agent of the Crown]
<P>
<H3>Preliminary views on the meaning of "manawhenua" for the Chatham Islands
claims</H3>
<EM>Wai 64 & others transcripts, 13 October 1994. Chief Judge Durie</EM><P>
At the recent Chatham Islands hearing the Chairperson expressed preliminary views on the
meaning of "manawhenua". The term may have 2 meanings; long term ancestral connections
with the land, or status and authority held at any particular time. Historically it seems to have
attached to persons. The operation of the land court may have distorted the concept so that it
applied to the ownership of defined land areas by groups. There may be doubt whether the
words "mana whenua" and "tangata whenua" as defined in the Resource Management Act
accord with Maori custom. "Tangata whenua" may mean the home people of a marae, those
with ancestral association with land, or those who have come into the land through
intermarriage, or even "Maori people of NZ". Words must be used carefully so they do not
develop a "tyranny" of their own, especially where the Maori thinking behind them is not
explored. It is not certain that the land court in fact determined mana whenua and tangata
whenua status or had any authority to do so. Moriori and Ngati Mutunga may both have
manawhenua in the Chathams but of a different type, and both may be tangata whenua.
<P>
<H2><HR>Other jurisdictions</H2>
<H3>Atawhai Taiaroa and others v The Minister of Justice and others</H3>
<EM>CP 99/94, 4 October 1994, McGechan J</EM><P>
The plaintiffs claimed that the "Maori Option" exercise of February to April 1994, which
permitted Maori in that period to choose between the Maori roll and General roll, was
unlawful
because it was held without adequate notice or Crown resources. Maori had in fact 3 options.
To be on the General roll identified as Maori, on the General roll and not identified as Maori,
or on the Maori roll. The option was conducted under ss76-79 Electoral Act 1993. Its
outcome
determined, by a technical calculation, the number of Maori seats. This calculation is
particularly sensitive to Maori on the General roll and identified as Maori shifting to the Maori
roll. A group of Maori making this shift would have more impact on the number of Maori
seats
than a similar sized group coming fresh on to the Maori roll (eg using present figures, 50,000
new electors on the Maori roll would result in 6 Maori seats, but 50,000 Maori switching from
the General to the Maori roll would result in 7 seats). Conversely, it was not "neutral" for
Maori to remain on the general roll identified as Maori. The option came about after
representations from pan-Maori organisations in 1993 seeking retention of the Maori seats
under the proposed MMP system. This, and the MMP proposal generally, were provided for
in
the Electoral Act passed in August 1993. In November 1993 a nationwide referendum chose
MMP as the preferred electoral system. Maori voted for MMP in a higher proportion (2/3)
than the general population. The election result required the Minister of Justice to set a date
"as
soon as practicable" for the Maori option. From September 1993 publicity about the option
had been available. The Minister set the date for the option as February 1994, but did not
consider an extensive publicity campaign, including television advertising, was required.
<P>
 Immediately prior to the option the Waitangi Tribunal reported on a claim seeking further
resources to inform Maori, and recommended further funding be made available. Cabinet
subsequently rejected a proposal t spend an additional $250,000 on publicity. The result of the
option had been an increase from 4 to 5 Maori seats.
<P>
Held: the Minister had not acted unlawfully in exercising his discretion as to the timing of the
option and its conduct. The discretion arose under the Electoral Act 1993 (the treaty itself
could not give rise to rights, nor could international law unless incorporated by statute, nor did
the NZ Bill of Rights provide especially for Maori rights). Before setting the option date the
Minister had to be satisfied that as far as reasonably achievable under all prevailing
circumstances, "target" Maori were sufficiently informed of the option implications to make a
meaningful choice. Reasonableness would take account of the importance of the issue, the
desirability in principle of fullest information to all, qualified by issues of time, expense, cost
benefit and expectations. Among reasons for rejecting the many heads of claim:
<P>
- There was no absolute duty to consult with Maori before making the decision. The Minister
was only required to be adequately self informed on these issues<BR>
 - The Minister could take account of the recent close election in setting the date for the
option
in as far as it suggested a fresh election might soon be held and the MMP system needed to be
in place as soon as possible<BR>
- There was no requirement to inform Maori not yet enroled. The option was only to those
enroled on the Maori roll, or enroled on the General roll and identifying as Maori (the 'target"
group)<BR>
- While there was a partnership obligation of good faith, it would be stretching fiduciary duty
principles to find a fiduciary duty here<BR>
 - There was no legitimate expectation that an education campaign would be undertaken. No
government statement or well established practice was in evidence. There must be more than a
"reasonable" expectation<BR>
- As to the conduct of the option, the publicity was incomplete (in particular not giving details
of the technical calculation of the number of Maori seats) but not significantly misleading
overall (but noted that it was not pointed out that the number of Maori seats could be reduced
if enough Maori chose the General roll)<BR>
- As to the rejection of Waitangi Tribunal advice, such advice was not mandatory, although
highly respected. The Crown was entitled to look at financial constraints (as it did) a matter on
which the tribunal report was weak. Rejection of the tribunal view might be wrong, but not
beyond reason<BR>
- The Minister did not have to go beyond a direct mail out of the option applications, since this
was the method provided by the legislation.
<P>
The final ground pleaded of substantive unfairness caused the most difficulty. The test was
whether in all the circumstances, the conduct of the option unfairly deprived Maori of a proper
opportunity to make an informed choice. The court considered affidavits providing anecdotal
evidence that many Maori might not have had adequate information, as well as the Waitangi
Tribunal report predicting further resources would be required. Most significant were final
figures for the option which showed that up until the beginning of the option, Maori coming
onto the rolls were not aware of the implication of choosing to go on the General as opposed
to
the Maori roll (despite publicity on MMP up to that point, which the Minister considered
made
Maori informed and ready for the option exercise). There was a sharp increase during the
option period in the Maori roll, but most of this increase came from new Maori enrolments
and
not any switch of existing enroled Maori. All this suggested a "worrying degree of ignorance
within a portion of eligible Maori" not cured by mailouts or written material. The approach of
Cooke P in <EM>Thames Valley EPB v NZFP Pulp and Paper Ltd</EM> (1994) 2 NZLR
641 was
followed. Where a procedure is marginally adequate a matter might survive review, but fail
where the decision was also marginal. In this case the Minister's decision as to resources
narrowly survived. The procedural side had tolerable strength, but the decision, while not
irrational, was to some degree wrong in hindsight. There was not therefore substantive
unfairness, but the Crown should feel "some concern" at what had occurred.
<P>
As to the Treaty, while treaty obligations are not directly enforceable by the court, the creation
of the 4 Maori seats was consistent with the Treaty (whatever the political reasons for their
creation originally). The Crown is under a Treaty obligation to protect and facilitate Maori
representation. It would not for example be consistent with the Treaty to now deny separate
Maori representation. In this light the Crown should reflect on the resource decision made,
which was based on an important underlying misconception as to the degree of Maori
understanding of the implications of the option. Maori were significantly disadvantaged. An
"extensive effort" might be considered when the option is next exercised in 1997.
<P>
[ed: the court focused on the complexity of the choice Maori had to make under the option
and
the decision to use what were described as "minimal" resources to explain it. Whether
increased resources would have brought more new Maori electors onto the rolls was
irrelevant.
As the court explained, the option, by law, was aimed only at Maori already on the rolls (Yet
the efforts of Maori groups before and during the option, and submissions by counsel, made
much of census figures showing a "lost tribe" of up to 50,000 Maori not on any roll). This was
a close decision. The appeal (now proceeding) is awaited with interest]
<P>
<H3>KM Grace v WG Grace</H3>
<EM>CA 211/93, 26 October 1994. Cooke P, Richardson J, Tipping J</EM><P>
A wife, on separating from her husband, sought a half share in his interests in Maori freehold
land claiming that, because of conduct and intentions during the marriage, there was a
resulting
trust or a constructive trust in her favour. These trusts existed quite apart from the
Matrimonial
Property Act 1976 which does not apply to interests in Maori land (s6). The wife sought to
have the trust proceedings dealt with in the High Court. The husband objected, arguing that
the
Maori Land Court had exclusive jurisdiction to consider the matter. The High Court
determined that it could consider the matter. The husband appealed.
<P>
Held: Although Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 failed to carry over a provision of the Maori
Affairs Act 1953 giving the High Court concurrent jurisdiction and therefore the ability to
exercise its inherent jurisdiction in relation to trusts (compare s18/1993 and s30/1953), that
concurrent jurisdiction nevertheless remained under the 1993 Act (although it was noted that
the 1993 Act spelt out more explicitly those areas where the MLC has exclusive jurisdiction).
<P>
Noted that the High Court, or MLC if it considered this case, would have to have regard to
the
policy and provisions of the 1993 Act designed to promote the retention of Maori freehold
land
in the hands of its owners, their whanau and hapu and restricting spousal interests to life
interests in matters of succession. Further noted that, in view of these considerations the wife
here sought only the monetary equivalent of Maori freehold interests and not a vesting order
for the interests themselves. If a question of tikanga Maori arose it could be referred by way of
case stated to the Maori Appellate Court.
<P>
[ed: a brief but important judgment. The general courts are to retain a potentially important
role
in the development of Maori land law. It also suggests that non-owning spouses, on
separation,
may sue for the monetary equivalent of part of their partner's interests in Maori freehold land]
<P>
<H3>Auckland Casino Ltd v Casino Control Authority & Others</H3>
<EM>CA 181/94, 20 October 1994. Cooke P, Hardie Boys J, McKay J</EM><P>
An appeal from a High Court decision in July 1994 (see MLR Aug 1994) dismissing an
application for review of the decision of the Casino Control Authority to grant the Auckland
casino licence to Sky Tower Casino Ltd rather than a consortium which included the Maori
Congress backed company, Aohou Ltd. The appeal raised only two grounds from the High
Court proceedings, presumptive bias and apparent bias by reason of certain shareholdings and
activities of some authority members. An argument that the authority displayed an anti-Maori
bias in certain of its actions was not pursued.
<P>
Held: there was at most a borderline case of presumptive or apparent bias but there was a
waiver by the appellants in failing to raise these matters at an earlier stage and in failing to
move quickly after the authority decision was delivered. The Maori aspect of the failed bid,
including the desire to enhance the welfare of Maori, was not to be "overlooked", but also
noted was the considerable expenditure already undertaken by the successful applicant, and
doubts the authority had had about details of the proposal of the Maori backed consortium.

<H3>Te Runanganui o Ngati Kahungunu Inc v Gemmell and others</H3>
<EM>CP 21/94, 6 October 1994. Grieg J</EM><P>
An application for variation of receivership orders, notable for the rejection by the court of an
argument that the current receivers be replaced by a senior officer from Te Puni Kokiri who, it
was argued, would bring an important "Maori dimension" to the receivership exercise.

Council</H3>
<EM>A72/94, 20 September 1994. Bollard J & commissioners Dr AH Hackett, Mr IG
McIntyre</EM><P>
The council notified a change to its transitional district plan to allow for future urban
development in an area previously zoned for rural use and the site of a river important to local
Maori and of two hapu communities with longstanding links with the area. The change
reflected an urban growth strategy developed during 1991-91. The appellants challenged the
basis of the plan change.
<P>
Held: the council had failed to adequately consult with Maori in terms of the RMA when
developing the urban growth strategy. Subsequent consultation was misconceived, being
aimed
at minimising the impact of a policy already decided. Previous cases concerning consultation
under the RMA with Maori which held that there should be no direct consultation by councils
over resource consents (Ngatiwai, Hanton et al) could be distinguished as they did not deal
with the development of plans. Comments in <EM>Wellington Airport Ltd v Air NZ</EM>
[1993] 1 NZLR
671 re consultation were quoted with approval. Consultation does not necessarily produce
consensus, but it must continue for a reasonable time so that all reasonable planning options
can be explored. Repeat consultations may be required even after plans have been approved.
Councils cannot provide guarantees of unalterability however, but must step back once plans
are notified in order to judicially consider submissions on the plan.
<P>
[ed: a significant case on consultation requirements when developing district and regional
plans.
The court noted that this council was to some extent "caught out" in the transition between
the
loose requirements under the Town and Country Planning Act 1977 and the much tighter
requirements of the RMA]

<H3>Report of the Reserved Lands Panel 1993</H3>
<EM>Te Puni Kokiri, January 1994 (released October 1994). P Trapski, G Kirby, R Cooper
</EM><P>
A report of a panel appointed by the Minister of Maori Affairs to consult on proposals to
resolve Maori reserved lands issues contained in A Framework for Negotiation - Toitu Te
Whenua 1993. The panel, after hearing submissions, broadly supported the proposals but
recommended, among other things:
<P>
- Greater emphasis on the proposal that owners and tenants reach their own solutions, with the
Crown playing a role of facilitation by providing financial and legislative assistance,
professional advice, and possibly purchasing properties as required<BR>
- Leases should terminate after 2 further 21 year renewal periods (the Framework document
recommended 3 renewal periods)<BR>
- Rents to be reviewed at market levels in 3 years, then every 3 years following (the
Framework
proposed 14 years). This rent to be assessed using benchmark values provided by Valuation
NZ that bear some relation to the "land value" approach, and not just "unimproved value"
wIn the remaining term of leases, owners to be given the first right of purchase at a market
value<BR>
- Owners be empowered to sell their interests at market value<BR>
- The Maori Trustee to be gradually phased out of the administration of reserved lands.
<P>
The proposal of the Framework document that tenants not be compensated for changed
arrangements, but merely assisted in case of hardship, was supported. Compensation should
not be payable to those who had received the benefit of an unjust contract, whose injustice
was
known in general terms before and certainly after the 1975 review of reserved lands.
<P>
[ed: the panel recommended giving power to owners to sell their interests on the basis that to
deny this would be contrary to the Treaty and, as economic benefits from the land grow, the
likelihood of sales "for survival purposes" will be minimised. Te Ture Whenua Maori 1993 is
more stringent, requiring consent from 75% of shareholders before incorporation lands can be
sold, which is difficult to obtain (the panel noted this point twice)]
<P>
<H3>Mana Tangata. Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 1993.
Background
and discussion on key issues</H3>
<EM>Te Puni Kokiri 1994</EM><P>
Seeks further views on the draft declaration, because of changes to it since 1990. Major issues
are outlined, in particular the meaning of "self-determination" (which the NZ government
takes
to mean "self-management" and not secession), and the definition of "indigenous people".
Includes also the text of the "Mataatua Declaration" on cultural and intellectual property
rights.
Submissions are due by 31 October 1994.
<P>
<H3>Native Title Re-established. Paper to International Bar Association 25 Biennial
Conference, Melbourne</H3>
<EM>Office of the Chief Judge, 13 October 1994. E T Durie</EM><P>
Deals with the nature, extent and limitations of native title. The Native Land Court simplified
Maori land tenure and ignored a complex web of overlapping use rights. Three levels of rights
existed, use rights by individuals, political rights of the tribe, and associational rights. The
actions of the land court "confiscated" political and associational rights, and, in some cases,
individual rights (eg where names were left off ownership lists). Alienation and extinguishment
of native title are also considered. In "strict terms" the Treaty seems to forbid compulsory
acquisition, and place a restriction on the sovereignty ceded by it, which is not "readily
diminished" by the balance of convenience (the Te Maunga report, which came to a contrary
opinion, is mentioned as one which "other divisions of the Tribunal may not be inclined to
follow"). Expresses surprise that the Australian Native Title Act 1993 places the onus on
Aborigines to establish their right to land while the Crown may rely on legal presumptions and
fictions, but hopes that the Act will provide a new form of title built on a customary base and
facilitate pragmatic arrangements for future management.

<H3>November 1994</H3>
<PRE>

</PRE>

<H2><HR>Who represents Maori groups?</H2>
The Government is preparing to announce new proposals for the resolution of claims, but
there
is no sign that the fundamental issue of representation has yet been considered in a
comprehensive way. According to the newspapers, Cabinet papers provide that tribes will be
required to file a "deed of mandate". This has some similarity with proposals of the Treaty of
Waitangi Fisheries Commission (<EM>Discussion Material on Allocation Models for
Consultation with Iwi Te Ohu Kai Moana</EM> August 1994) which would require iwi to
undergo a registration procedure before fishing quota would be allocated to them.
<P>
The procedure to determine representation attracting most interest is section 30(1)(b) of Te
Ture Whenua Maori 1993, which provides that any person may apply to the Chief Judge of
the
Maori Land Court for him to request the Court to determine "the most appropriate
representatives" of any group of Maori for the purposes of any consultations, negotiations or
other matter. The latest decision under that section, <EM>In Re Tararua District
Council</EM> (138 Napier MB 85, 1 November 1994, reviewed in this issue), has laid out
some important principles for considering modern representation. The court has indicated it
will not rely heavily on the disposition of iwi at 1840, or on Native Land Court determinations
in the last century, but will rather look to recent arrangements which have developed from old
principles. In addition, the court will place a premium on unity. Until now, divisiveness has
had
legal "rewards"; in claimant status before the Waitangi Tribunal, research funding, hearings
before local authorities and the like, although the ultimate result has been the present
confusion
and gridlock over representation.
<P>
However, s30 may face a conflict with the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, which allows any
Maori to bring a claim (s6). If a group secures a s30 order for negotiations over a claim and
the
right to lay future claims, what happens if another group from the same iwi lays a claim before
the tribunal? The Government is said to be considering an amendment to the 1975 Act,
allowing the tribunal to determine whether claimants before it adequately represent those on
whose behalf the claim is made. Hopefully there will be some tie up with s30 to prevent
overlap, or worse, conflicting decisions.
<P>
Ultimately, given the dynamic nature of Maori society and institutions, a policy for
determining
representation which is too rigid would be undesirable and might even be regarded as a breach
of the Treaty. There should always be an allowance for new situations to produce new models
and leaders, as the experience of the past few decades have shown.
<P>
<H2><HR>Maori Land Court and Appellate Court</H2>
<H3>In Re Tararua District Council</H3>
<EM>138 Napier MB 85, 1 November 1994. Hingston J, with H Hohepa, S Jones as
additional members</EM><P>
The district council applied under s30(1)(b)/1993 for a determination of the appropriate
representatives of Maori in the district with whom it should consult over any matters requiring
consultation, notice, negotiations etc. The request stemmed from a difficulty in determining
between two groups, Tamaki Nui a Rua (Kahungunu), and Rangitane O Tamaki Nui A Rua,
each claiming primacy in the district.
<P>  
Held: neither group could claim to exclusively represent tangata whenua in the district. Both
Rangitane and Kahungunu descended from common ancestors and had enjoyed historical
rights of occupancy and use in the area. The matter should be adjourned to allow discussion
between the groups, with the assistance of a facilitator if required, with a view to suggesting a
common list of persons to be appointed as representatives. The court laid out principles it
believed should be adopted in such proceedings:
<P>
- He ritenga ano: Maori society is not uniformly endowed with cultural resources. History has
not had a uniform effect on Maori society, language and traditions, which in some areas are
stronger than in others or have been adapted through the influence of religion. Historic
circumstances of the claimant seeking representation rights need to be assessed. <BR>
- He rourou: Representation is about obligations rather than being simply an assertion of
rights.
The Court will seek to avoid models which lead to a growth in adversarialism, instead using
those that provide scope for all parties to find that their interests have been addressed and
acted
upon.<BR>
- He au rere tonu: The court should not consider itself bound by the exact manner in which
title was determined in the 19th century. Ascertainment of tangata whenua status requires a far
more dynamic approach.<BR>
- Marae: The court should look to local marae in matters of customary authority, because it is
probably the single most enduring institution in Maoridom. Change has not seen the creation
of
new tribes, but marae have continued, and new marae have been established and flourished in
cities. The functioning of the marae can be seen as the expression of authority through
customary practices.<BR>
- Customary authority: Authority which loses a legitimate basis becomes naked power or
pokanoa, unsanctioned. Too much discussion about the future is focused on the situation of
Maori during the 1840s (ahikaroa and customary take, while important, were not and are not
definitive). The Maori politico-social structure was never static. The Maori Appellate Court in
<EM>In re Henare Rakiihia Tau & Ngai Tahu Trust Board</EM> (4 South Island ACMB
673) determined that changes in tribal boundaries could not be brought about by warfare or
force after the Treaty had been accepted, but other incidences of traditional change remained
intact. Many hapu were assimilated or integrated with other hapu and their separate identity
submerged by Crown dealings and actions of the Native Land Court. Some now seek their
former status. The court will accept this re-emergence only when there is acceptance by all,
particularly the hapu which have harboured them. In the absence of war, re-emerging hapu
should adopt a consensual process relying on customary concepts such as whanaungatanga.
There should be a deliberate process to ascertain the reasons for contemporary divisions.
Existing entities, which have provided in the past for emerging groups, need to be part of any
process leading to new groups.
<P>
Accordingly, the court found it odd that Rangitane people, claiming tangata whenua status in
the area, failed to acknowledge their whakapapa links with Kahungunu. Inclusiveness ought to
characterise strategies for iwi development such as those being pursued by the Rangitane
group. For the Kahungunu group, which relied on current land ownership and argued that
Rangitane were seeking to overturn longstanding arrangements, the court observed that
Native
Land Court determinations presented in evidence would not be seen as the sole or even major
arbiter of current tangata whenua status. Existing marae are a more important factor which
show a willingness to uphold the obligations that go with authority. Legal body corporates
created in response to the government's iwi devolution policy and accompanying transfer of
funding to iwi, do not necessarily have customary authority. Rather, authority is rooted in
institutions which continue to exist such as marae. 
<P>
Rangatiratanga should not be used as a weapon to exclude others, the emphasis should be on
duties and obligations involved in the concept. Underpinning rangatiratanga are values such as
whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga which raise the importance of reciprocity,
stewardship and cohesiveness. 
<P>
[ed: this is the first judgment to set out principles which may be followed in making s30(1)(b)
determinations. It will be interesting to watch the further development or adoption of these
principles in forthcoming judgments. The court noted that it retained the ability to appoint a
mixture of representatives in an effort to force unity if the parties fail to agree a common set of
representatives]
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Directions, memoranda on procedure, evidence and issues in the inquiry into the Ngati
Awa, Tuwharetoa, and other claims of the Eastern Bay of Plenty as at end October
1994</H3>
<EM>Wai 46 & Ors, Doc #2.59, 11 November 1994</EM><P>
A lengthy memoranda concerning procedural and research issues affecting 11 claims and 9
other parties. Matters dealt with were:
<P>
- Order of hearing: where there are conflicting claims the tribunal seeks to have each group
first appear to outline their claims on their own marae or other places of their choosing in
order
to satisfy the need to present claims in their own way and clarify issues and any conflicting
interests. The alternative procedure of seriatim presentations by rival groups at the one place
has been tried but found wanting. Statements of claim may be altered and the degree of
support for any claim sounded out by preliminary hearings. Those groups with research
completed first and otherwise ready to proceed will be the first heard. <BR>
- Procedure at hearings: extensive cross examination is discouraged, particularly in relation to
historical evidence (which can be dealt with by written questions) and kaumatua evidence. The
right to recall witnesses at a later stage after issues have been defined may be exercised. Where
"binding recommendations" are sought a higher standard of proof will be required and a more
court-like process adopted. The tribunal appears to have a power to adjourn its inquiry while
parties undertake private mediation between themselves (this is apart from the mediation
power
provided in the 2nd schedule, Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975). Attempts to secure agreements
on
boundaries by mediation have not been successful in the past, but the tribunal encourages
private mediation on selected issues and will give serious weight to agreements reached.
Compulsory settlement conferences (a court practice) are not favoured as the 1975 Act
contemplates that groups should air their grievances fully in the manner and place they choose
unless special circumstances suggest otherwise.<BR>
- Referral of a "boundaries question" to the Maori Appellate Court: the tribunal "is not entirely
convinced that iwi were [historically] arranged as state-like institutions with borders of
approximate definition fuzzed only by contestable zones." Overlaps between groups could be
extensive. The meanings of mana and mana whenua are also not certain. Loss of mana, and
not just land, may have been a key factor in the impact of confiscations. There are doubts
whether the issue for the MAC to consider under s6A/1975, which assumes the existence of
definite boundaries, is the correct one in any event.<BR>
- Other matters: past settlement precedents suggest Maori groups are not limited to seeking
reparation from Crown lands in their own area (assuming no competing claims on Crown land
elsewhere).
<P>
Prima facie claims had been made out in respect of the Rotoehu forest and Te Mahoe village
lands.
<P>
[ed: this lengthy memo is the most current and detailed statement on tribunal procedure for
dealing with complex overlapping claims. The tribunal re-iterates its preference for limited
cross-examination and a less court-like procedure generally. How far this preference can be
realised remains to be seen. As an example of the adversarial nature of the proceedings, the
memo also dealt with an allegation of bias on the part of one tribunal member (it found no real
likelihood of bias and that any right to object had been waived). For a discussion of recent
tendencies in tribunal procedure see R Boast "The Waitangi Tribunal: `Conscience of the
Nation', or Just Another Court?" <EM>Uni NSW Law Journal</EM> vol 16 1993 p223]
<P>
<H2><HR>General</H2>
<H3>Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Bill</H3>
<EM>No 48, 1994</EM><P>
This bill is intended to provide a comprehensive and consistent approach to the management
of
all hazardous substances and new organisms (including genetically modified organisms). It
proposes that the relationship of Maori and their culture and traditions with their ancestral
lands, water, sites, waahi tapu, valued flora and fauna, and other taonga, and kaitiakitanga are
matters which must be recognised and provided for by all persons exercising functions and
powers under the Act (cl5). The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi are also to be 'taken into
account' when exercising power under the proposed Act (cl6). When choosing members for
the 5 to 7 member Environmental Risk Management Authority, which will control the
manufacture or importation of new hazardous substances and new organisms, the Minister
may
consider, among other things, knowledge and experience of the Treaty of Waitangi or kaupapa
Maori to be relevant (cl10). Not only must the authority consider the impact of new and
existing substances or organisms on native organisms (which includes organisms introduced by
Maori before European settlement), but also on exotic species valued for Maori traditional
harvest or recreation (cl27).
<P>
[ed: a special select committee will hear submissions on the bill. Closing date for submissions
is
3 February 1995. The pesticide sodium fluoroacetate (also known as 1080), is covered by the
Bill. It is interesting to speculate how this proposed Act might have affected the current
debate
among Maori groups over the use of 1080 in Northland]
<P>

<H3>Deed between Her Majesty the Queen and Ngati Koata No Rangitoto Ki Te Tonga
Trust
and James Hemi Elkington</H3>
<EM>29 November 1994</EM><P>
This island, gifted by Ngati Kuia to Ngati Koata in 1824, was taken by the Crown for a
lighthouse site in 1891. Compensation was ordered to be paid to the native owners in 1895.
This deed records the settlement of a claim to the Waitangi Tribunal (Wai 95) complaining
about that taking.
<P>
Ngati Koata and the Crown agree that the protection of the island and the conservation
interests of Ngati Koata will be best achieved by declaring the island (currently a wildlife
sanctuary) a reserve under the Reserves Act 1977. The Crown undertakes to consult Ngati
Koata over management of the reserve. A remnant area of lighthouse reserve remains outside
these consultation arrangements. In exchange, Ngati Koata, in exercise of their mana over the
island and their role as kaitiaki, "as a free gift and symbol of partnership with the Crown"
agree
that their claim is satisfied by the deed and will withdraw it from the Waitangi Tribunal. The
Crown does not admit the claim, but entered the deed to protect threatened species living on
the island and to acknowledge Ngati Koata mana. 
<P>
[ed: this settlement has been represented as "in effect" the return of the island to Ngati Koata
who have gifted it to the Crown (<EM>Dominion</EM> 30 November 1994). The wording
of the deed suggests something quite different. The Crown has agreed to create a nature
reserve of what was formerly a wildlife sanctuary. The Crown will consult Ngati Koata about
management - something it would have done in any event. Under the Reserves Act 1977,
Ngati
Koata preferences for management may not, as of right, be given any greater weight than
those
of, say, the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. In addition, the deed greatly simplifies
future Crown consultation with Maori over the island. It is therefore difficult to see that Ngati
Koata have gained from the Crown any tangible legal rights to better protect their interest in
the
island in exchange for relinquishing the legal right to pursue their claim]
<P>
<H3>Appointment to Office of Treaty Settlements</H3>
<EM>Department of Justice, 14 November 1994</EM><P>
Belinda Clark, presently a policy manager at Te Puni Kokiri, has been appointed to head the
Office of Treaty Settlements, now being formed out of the Treaty of Waitangi Policy Unit.
<P>
<H3>Law Commission Annual Report 1994</H3>
<EM>NZLC R32, Parliamentary Paper E31</EM><P>
The commission has adopted a Maori name, Te Aka Matua O Te Ture, derived from the
legend of Tawhaki who was exhorted to climb to the heavens by a main vine (with its roots in
the earth) and not by the less secure tendrils. The commission has established a standing Maori
committee of Bishop Manuhuia Bennett, Judge Michael Brown, Professor Mason Durie and
Whetu Wereta to assist it in the "development of a bicultural framework for the law of New
Zealand". A consultation strategy with Maori which has been developed is outlined, which
may
include limited financial assistance to assist groups to collect and present material. Guidelines
for applications for this assistance are available on request. Two projects where Maori input
will be sought are reports on reforming the laws of succession and the law of tenure and
estates.
<P>
<H3>The Sealord Fishing Settlement. An International Perspective
</H3>
<EM>Michael Robinson. Auckland University Law Review 7(3) 1994 p557
</EM><P>
This article considers whether or not Maori who are aggrieved by the Sealords settlement
could
successfully make a complaint to the Human Rights Committee of the UN that, by passing
legislation which extinguished Maori fishing rights, the NZ Parliament acted in breach of its
international obligations as expressed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights. Article 27 of the Covenant provides that "persons belonging to ... minorities shall not
be denied the right in community with other members of their group, to enjoy their own
culture". The complaint would be made to the Human Rights Committee under the "Optional
Protocol" procedure which allows complaints from individuals where domestic remedies have
been exhausted. The article concludes that it is difficult to predict the likelihood of success of
such a complaint, but the potential for success exists. Notes that the Optional Protocol makes
individuals subjects of international law, where formerly only states were, but that indigenous
groups have yet to be recognised and presently must rely on "hybrid rights" such as those in
article 27.
<P>
<H3>The Phenomenon of Agreement: a Maori Perspective</H3>
<EM>Mina Wharepouri. Auckland University Law Review 7(3) 1994 p603
</EM><P>
Quotes Macneil (<EM>The New Social Contract</EM> 1980); "never has contract occurred
without society; ... and never can its functioning be understood isolated from its particular
society", as the background to a discussion of koha or the "gift exchange process" as
underlying transactions between Maori and early Pakeha settlers. Utu and tika (etiquette) are
important concepts underlying koha exchanges. Features of koha are; an obligation to give, an
obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay. The concept of hau, which holds that
possessions contain part of the essence of a person, underlies the obligation to repay.
Although
possession may be ceded, hau means that a portion of ownership of the good is retained.
Repayments accordingly acknowledge and strengthen links between people. Before 1840
Maori did not have a word meaning full and permanent extinguishment of all rights for
consideration amounting to a sale. This affected the understanding of early land transactions in
the Muriwhenua region. The Treaty of Waitangi can be considered as a special contract, with
Maori transferring the hau of their lands, but not the mana. 
<P>
[ed: the view that different expectations existed for early land transactions in Muriwhenua is
presently under consideration by the Waitangi Tribunal in its hearing of the claim Wai 45]
<P>
<H3>Australian National Native Title Tribunal ruling</H3>
<EM>Aboriginal Law Bulletin, October 1994</EM><P>
The tribunal has made its first decision under the Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993, ruling
that native title does not exist on 3.7 hectares of land in a proposed residential subdivision 165
km north of Brisbane. This was an unopposed non-claimant application brought by the owners
of the affected land. The decision was on the basis that Crown dealings with the land have
been wholly inconsistent with continued aboriginal title (it was designated as a roadway). The
land is in the traditional country of the Gubbi Gubbi people, whose other claims are not
affected.
<P>
<H3>Restitution of Land Rights Act (South Africa) 1994</H3>
<EM>South African Financial Mail 18 November</EM><P>
The Act allows any person or community to claim restitution for dispossession of land rights
under apartheid laws since 19 June 1913. However, restitution will not be given in cases of
"bona fide" expropriation under the Expropriation Act where "just and equitable"
compensation was paid. Claims are advanced by a 2 step process. A Commission on the
Restitution of Land Rights will investigate the merits of claims and may mediate a settlement.
Where claims remain unsettled, the commission will present evidence to a Land Claims Court
which may order the State to restore the land where this is "just and equitable". This can be
achieved by handing over land if it is in State hands or purchasing the land if it is in private
hands. Where restoration is not feasible (the interests of all parties, including any private
landowner, and present use, are considered), equivalent State-owned land or compensation
may be ordered. Ninety five rural communities and about 110,000 urban families affected by
apartheid laws are expected to have claims. Claims must be lodged within 3 years, and it is
hoped to complete the entire process within 5 years.
<P>
[ed: in South African terms, the Act affects few people and is expected to cost little to
implement, but is seen as an important symbolic gesture. Experience with claims processes
here
and in other countries suggest the estimates as to cost and time are optimistic]

<H2><HR>Tena Koutou</H2>
Welcome to the first issue of the monthly Maori Law Review. The
reasons for publishing the
review are two-fold.
<P>
First, the perennial demand among Maori land law practitioners
for a better decisions service.
The need is possibly greater now because of the recent
introduction of Te Ture Whenua Maori
(Maori Land Act) 1993.
<P>
Second, the imperative which is emerging for general
practitioners to keep abreast of
developments in what might be termed "general Maori law".
References to Maori concepts and
the Treaty of Waitangi now appear in many major statutes and
decisions of the general courts.
Consequently, practitioners face Maori law problems in a
surprising (and growing) number of
areas. 
<P>
Specifically, the review will report on:
<P>
Maori Land Court<BR>
- Land Court and Appellate Court decisions of interest<BR>
- Te Ture Whenua Maori and related law; legislative, regulatory
and rule changes
Waitangi Tribunal<BR>
- Reports<BR>
- Practice notes<BR>
- Directions/memoranda of interest<BR>
<P>
General Courts and law<BR>
- Decisions impacting on Maori land and other resources eg
Resource Management Act, Rating
Powers Act, Maori fisheries legislation<BR>
- Law changes in areas impacting on Maori land and other resource
use.
<P>
An index will also be provided annually.
<P>
The review also offers a "Stop Press" option - immediate faxed
information on important
decisions made within any month eg the forthcoming Privy Council
judgment on Maori
broadcasting.
<P>
Guest writers will provide an editorial comment each month. 
<P>
The editor is a consultant on Treaty issues. He has worked with
the Waitangi Tribunal as legal
officer for 5 years and been an adviser to the Maori Land Court,
Head Office.

<H3>Application by Public Trustee re Te Omeka Manunui </H3>
<EM>1993 CJ MB 516, 23 September 1993, McHugh Deputy CJ</EM><P>
Whether land of an intestate was General land or Maori freehold
land at the time of death. If
the
land was Maori freehold land on intestacy the widow had a life
interest only with the children
taking the remainder. Confusion had arisen because of a sale to
Europeans registered against
the
certificate of title, thrown into doubt by a subsequent
retransfer and later Court orders as to
status.
<P>
Held; that upon registration of a transfer to a European Maori
freehold land becomes General
land. No further order is necessary. Earlier orders made on the
assumption the land was Maori
freehold land should therefore be cancelled under s452. Principle
of ex abundante cautela
applied; the children of the deceased who held the remainder
under the orders made in error
were
to be given an opportunity to lodge objections before final
correcting orders made.
<P>
<H3>Rangi Kaata or Cotter Deceased </H3>
<EM>135 Gisborne MB, 28 October 1993, McHugh Deputy CJ</EM><P>
Dispute over succession. Held; that despite the kaupapa of the
1993 Act that succession be
restricted to blood-lines and preferred classes within kinship
groups, s100(2) permits no
discretion and requires that where administration is granted
prior to the commencement of the
1993 Act the prior law applies. Agreed that the applicant as a
blood descendant had a strong
moral claim but "howsoever the application of the law may run
contrary to present Kaupapa
until it is amended the Court must simply apply that law."
Section 76/1967 requiring succession
on intestacy to be determined as if the deceased were European,
was applied. 
<P>
<H3>Mana Manuera Cracknell v The Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries
Commission & A-G </H3>
<EM>Tairawhiti MB, 26 October 1993, McHugh Deputy CJ (a more
explicit statement of
reasons for oral judgment of 13 October 1993)</EM><P>
The applicants had under s30(1)(b)/1993 petitioned the Chief
Judge to request the Maori Land
Court to determine the appropriate group within Ngati Kahungunu
to receive certain quota
from
the Commission. This case concerned an interim injunction sought
under s19(1)(b)/1993 to
prevent distribution by the Commission until a MLC determination
had been made [ed: or,
presumably, a decision by the CJ declining to request an MLC
determination].
<P>
Held; that an interlocutory order under s19(1)(b) must relate to
pending proceedings for
hearing
before the MLC or CJ. Because the CJ had not yet acted on the
petition and formally
requested a
MLC determination no proceedings were pending before that Court.
The filing of the petition
was sufficient for there to be proceedings pending before the CJ.
Cases concerning meaning of
"proceedings" were considered.
<P>
Orders under s19(1)(b) must concern property. While the 1993 Act
intended property to have
a
meaning wider than land, determinations under s30(1)(b) concern
only the appointment of
persons to represent Maori and not the actual division of or
dealing with any property.
Determinations under s30(1)(b) are binding only on the CJ and do
not bind any other party. 
The
purpose of s30(1)(b) is to determine the most appropriate group
with whom the Crown, a state
enterprise or local authority might deal and avoid later claims
from disaffected groups. The
section is not intended to give the MLC jurisdiction to review
actions of the Fisheries
Commission.
<P>
Although it did not have to be decided, the balance of
convenience "leans so heavily in favour
of
the first respondent and Ngati Kahungunu that it would be harsh
and inequitable to grant the
order". The applicant group (Rongomaiwahine) would take part in
the quota distribution
anyway under the proposed distribution via taiwhenua. There was
no evidence of exclusion or
financial loss [ed: the Court noted at an early stage the
applicants assertion that this case was a
matter of mana and not money - can mana be a consideration in the
"balance of
convenience"?]
Noted that, in appropriate circumstances (recent High Court
litigation between Maori re
fisheries
referred to) the MLC might copy the High Court approach and use
s73/1993 (empowering the
MLC to attach conditions to any order) to require an undertaking
as to damages as a condition
of
granting an interim injunction.
<P>
<H3>Application re Hopuhopu and Te Rapa</H3>
<EM>1993 CJ MB 583, 10 November 1993, McHugh Deputy CJ</EM><P>
An unusual case in which, on an appeal against certain vesting
orders of the Hamilton MLC the
Registrar of that Court was directed by the Maori Appellate Court
(MAC) to apply to the Chief
Judge to exercise his special powers to cancel the orders. The
Registrar made the application
but
queried whether it was appropriate.
<P>
Held; dismissing the application, that the MAC appeared to be
acting outside jurisdiction since
the appeal against the vesting orders was out of time. While
s45/1993 provides a new ability for
the Registrar to apply for the exercise of the CJ's special
powers, this is a matter of practical
convenience to correct straightforward errors and should be
exercised sparingly. The MAC
was
mistaken in thinking the vesting orders had been wrongly made
under s437(1) & (7)/1953
(Crown lands set aside for the benefit of Maori) and should have
been made under s436 (land
formerly taken for public works). There had been no public works
taking. This was a rare
instance of the CJ reviewing an MAC decision, and such power
should be carefully exercised,
or
referred to the High Court if outside the CJ's competence. 
<P>
[ed: the case is also of interest as an illustration of a
mechanism for the return of Crown lands
to
Maori. The lands concerned had been returned in recognition of
raupatu (confiscation) related
claims and vested in an eponymous ancestor, Potatau Te
Wherowhero. The Deputy CJ also
noted an alternative mechanism s437(4)/1953 allowing for vesting
in trustees and wide powers
under s437(4A) to vary the trust on application of interested
persons.]
<P>
<H3>In re Tauranga District Council and Ohuki No 1C Section 2
Block</H3>
<EM>52 Tauranga MB 97, 11 June and 9 August, Carter J</EM><P>
The District Council sought a charging order under s186/1988 on
the block. 
<P>
Held; that there is no legislative provision conferring on the
Court jurisdiction to make the
order.
The Rating Powers Act fails to make specific provision for such
an order (the equivalent
provision of the Rating Act 1967, s153(6), was omitted from the
1988 Act). The decision
relates
to charges only, councils may still levy and collect rates on
Maori freehold land [ed: the
problems with rating Maori land continue.]
<P>
<H3>Re an application by Haana Johnson concerning Tame Rotini and
Maraeroa B3B2B and
other blocks</H3>
<EM>1993 CJ MB 525, 27 September 1993, McHugh Deputy CJ</EM><P>
The applicant sought to amend or cancel a succession order of
1936 relating to Tame Rotini's
interests, claiming a child adopted customarily in 1905 by Rotini
had been overlooked when the
order was made. 
<P>
Held; the evidence provided in support (school record and letters
of support) was "weak".
There
were no persons alive who could give direct evidence of the
alleged adoption. Stronger prima
facie evidence from the applicant requested (this was not
forthcoming and the application was
dismissed 1993 CJMB 647). Noted, in addition, after reviewing
adoption law since 1901, that
to
be relied upon in proceedings, customary adoptions must have been
registered in the MLC
before
31 March 1910. Even this evidence would be capable of rebuttal.
<P>
[ed: a case where the possibilities of the Chief Judge special
powers under s44/1993 confront
the
practical evidential difficulties]
<P>
<H2><HR>Waitangi Tribunal</H2>
<H3>Maori Development Corporation Report
</H3>
<EM>7 WTR (Wai 350), 15 October 1993, Hingston J, Morris, Young,
Ingram</EM><P>
This is a report of two claims concerning the Crown decision to
sell on the open market its
49.9% shareholding in the MDC. The MDC and associated Poutama
Trust were established in
1987 to provide development banking on a profit making basis for
large scale Maori business
ventures. Poor returns in 1989-90 resulted in a shift from
lending to "financial packaging"
services for ventures and a subsequent return to profitability.
It was claimed: the Crown
investment in MDC was Treaty based; $5 million of the Crown
investment capitalised from a
1986-7 appropriation for Maori purposes should belong to Maori;
the proposed sale would
place
the original mission of the MDC in jeopardy; a minority of iwi
might benefit from the sale;
before any sale the Crown ought to return the MDC to its original
mission of development
banking. In separate proceedings during the hearing the High
Court ordered specific
performance of a contract for sale of the Maori Trustee's
substantial MDC shareholding (37%)
to a Maori incorporation of Tainui descendants (proprietors of
Taharoa C Block), see
<EM>The
Maori Trustee v The Proprietors of Taharoa C Block</EM> CA
238/93, 1 December 1993
(reviewed below).
Found, that tribalism is an essential and dominant feature of
Maori life and identity. There is a
Treaty principle requiring the Crown to act equitably between
tribes when promoting projects
for
the benefit of Maori generally so as not to unfairly advantage
particular iwi (positive
discrimination in particular cases an exception). The Crown
purpose in establishing and
investing in MDC as a development bank for Maori was Treaty
related. The Crown had failed
(by co-operation with another major shareholder or other means)
to retain this Treaty related
objective. The present market would allow return to a lending
role without undue risk to
continued profitability. The Crown was obliged to "actively
promote" the MDC original
mission
before divesting itself of its shareholding. Five million of the
Crown shares were held on behalf
of all Maori and should be transferred without consideration to
a pan Maori body. The
Poutama
Trust was such a pan Maori body. Concentration of MDC shares in
a few iwi (as a result of
High
Court proceedings or otherwise) would affect the present
perceived "neutrality" of the MDC
operation among iwi. Recommended that 5 million shares be
transferred without charge to
Poutama Trust. Should the High Court decision stand, the Crown
should retain its MDC shares
until a pan-Maori entity acquire its interest and retain pan
Maori control of MDC. Should the
decision be successfully appealed, the Crown should use its
influence to entrench the MDC
Treaty based objectives and limit ownership by individual iwi.
The 127 page report contains
over 60 pages in 8 appendices setting out most of the detailed
evidence and argument.
<P>
[ed: the appeal was not successful, see below CA 238/93, 1
December 1993].

<P>
<H3>Taranaki claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 143 doc 2.79, 6 October 1993, Orr</EM><P>
Counsel representing "various of Te Atiawa" applied for urgent
findings and a
recommendation
in respect of local authority land ("Pukeariki Reserve") under
conditional sale to a private
developer. By memorandum of 12 August 1993 (Wai 143 doc 2.72) the
Chairperson referred
the application to an urgent conference with certain questions
to be addressed. In this memo,
following the conference, it was concluded that the phrase "the
Crown" in s6(4A) as inserted
by
the Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1993 does not include local
authorities. However,
considered in light of s6(3) (compensation) and s6(4) (scope of
recommendation), the new
subsection does not prevent the tribunal recommending that the
Crown pay compensation
sufficient to enable the purchase by Maori of land presently on
the market. The amendment
seeks to prevent pressure being placed on private owners with no
present intention to sell land.
The conditional purchase agreement in this case however had taken
the land off the market.
Leave was granted to renew the application should circumstances
alter [ed: the Chairperson's
memo of 12 August gives the history of the land].
<P>
<H3>Tainui claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 30 doc 2.12, 7 October 1993, Durie CJ</EM><P>
The Tribunal considered a request for procedural directions re
a potential application under the
Crown Forest Assets Act 1989 for return of two Crown forests
(Onewhero and Maramarua).
The
Tribunal noted that whether a formal application to the Tribunal
should be made is a decision
for
the claimants and such application "may not be essential".
Research requirements prior to the
hearing of any application were outlined. It was noted that
research could assist negotiations as
well as any Tribunal proceeding.
<P>
[ed: the Tribunal appears to be adopting a flexible approach to
the Crown Forest Assets Act
1989 to facilitate settlements].
<P>
<H3>Whanganui River claim</H3>
<EM>Wai 167 doc A18, 19 November 1993, Durie CJ, Orr,
Walker</EM><P>
The claimants had been involved in negotiations with the Crown.
These had been deferred, in
the
meantime various initiatives affecting the river, including an
application for a water
conservation
order under Part IX Resource Management Act 1991 were proceeding.
The claimants sought
various recommendations and a priority hearing of the claim.
<P>
Found; in this case the 1991 Act was inconsistent with the Treaty
in its approach to resource
issues, because it allowed rights to be determined before
outstanding Maori claims to a
resource
are investigated. Claimants were further prejudiced in being put
to a form of proceedings
whose
very propriety was in issue. There was scope under the
ministerial discretion in s202/1991
(whether to appoint a special tribunal to hear application), to
delay that decision pending a
Waitangi Tribunal report. While the discretion does not allow
consideration of river ownership,
it does encompass cultural concerns on which the Tribunal would
presumably report. 
<P>
Accordingly recommended the Minister take no steps to appoint a
special tribunal until the
Waitangi Tribunal reports. Priority hearing set down for early
1994.
<P> [ed: illustrates the difficulty of divorcing Maori claims to
the ownership of resources from
management issues, as the 1991 Act has sought to do, and the
Tribunal disquiet with this
approach].
<P>
<H3>Undoing History. Chief Judge Eddie Taihakurei Durie. Land
tenure conference, New
Caledonia</H3>
<EM>Office of the Chief Judge, MLC, October 1993</EM><P>
A wide ranging speech reflecting on the approach to the work of
the Waitangi Tribunal  and
the
MLC. The central thesis: "... custom is seen to constrain
development in some Pacific places
but
many Maori present custom and tradition as fundamental to the
action taken, as a hedge against
assimilation and as the justification for an independent
political stance and commercial
methodology. The issue for them is not whether custom and
tradition should be maintained,
but
how it can be managed to uphold Maori identity and how it can be
modified and capitalised
upon to promote the people's material advance." Lists types of
hapu grievances advanced in
claims, and the WT's task "... to assess the impact of ...
changes against customary tenure,
contemporary Maori preferences and the constraints of the time."
Issues of custom arise in the
delivery of compensation, where custom and modern management
co-mingle. This generates
debate about relative roles of hapu and iwi, where "[t]he
proponents for each claim custom on
their side, but the issue is in fact about modern political
exigencies." Speculates on possible
reversal of British and Maori philosophical approaches, with
British law now adopting broad
norms of fairness etc, while Maori are converting former broad
principles to rules. Fisheries
settlement disputes discussed. Importance of comprehending the
underlying Maori ethos, in
which ancestors and their links to the land are central, and
implications of this for early land
purchases. Notes difficulties for lawyers in handling kaumatua
evidence and the need for the
development of lego-anthropological opinions (also for MLC work).
Discusses principles
adopted by WT in its approach to claims, and by government, Maori
and the courts in seeking
settlements, including effective tribal restoration if full
compensation is impracticable, no
"final"
settlements but rather review of settlements against stated
goals, negotiations to be public where
practicable with direct dialogue between Maori and interest
groups (conservation, farming etc).
Examines the changed role of the MLC over time, it now being a
"facilitator, mediator and
impartial adjudicator". Reforms which allow the reintegration of
uneconomic interests have not
however addressed the wider Maori desire for tribal control; in
the absence of a clear policy of
tribalisation, the claims process provides the best opportunity
for this.
<P>
<H3>Ngati Paoa Whanau Trust and others</H3>
<EM>Wai 72, 16 November 1993, Durie CJ</EM><P>
In this memo concerning hearing arrangements for Auckland-Hauraki
claims the tribunal
suggests that the perennial problem of overlapping claims may be
resolved by a two step
process.
Each affected group proving substantial loss, then referral of
questions of representation not
settled consensually to the Maori Land Court. It also notes that
piece-meal claims to
compensation from Crown lands as they appear on the market is
"inefficient" in that it
promotes
inter-tribal rivalry.

<H3>The Maori Trustee v The Proprietors of Taharoa C Block</H3>
<EM>Court of Appeal, CA 238/93, 1 December 1993, Cooke P, Casey
J, Hardie Boys J
(appeal from CL 41/93, 30 September 1993)</EM><P>
In which the Maori Trustee appealed a High Court decision giving
the respondents (Taharoa
C)
a decree of specific performance of a contract whereby the Maori
Trustee would sell his
7,000,004 shares in the Maori Development Corporation (MDC) and
shares in Te Maori
Lodges
Ltd to the highest bidder. 
<P>
Taharoa C and the Tainui Maori Trust Board had formed a
consortium to buy the shares. A
conditional contract between them foundered and the Maori Trustee
outlined in a letter to both
parties a sale process by way of competing bids between the two.
Taharoa C offered money to
the Tainui Board not to bid. The Maori Trustee received a letter
from Tainui stating that it was
interested in bidding, but that the sale process had been
'contaminated' by the Taharoa action
which would not obtain the best price for the Maori Trustee. Such
action was against the
"kaupapa of Tainui". The Maori Trustee then sought to stop the
sale process.
<P>
Held; that the Trustee's letter contained no implied term that
both parties would bid
competitively. There was not proper evidence before the Court to
consider the nature and
extent
of the offence alleged against the kaupapa of Tainui Maori and
whether the Maori dimension
in
statute law now be imported into equitable remedies, but noted
that such dimension would
presumably be confined to disputes between Maori. 
<P>
<H3>Area 1 Consortium Ltd & Another v The Treaty of Waitangi
Fisheries Commission &
Others</H3>
<EM>Court of Appeal, CA 224/93, 29 September 1993, Cooke P, McKay
J, Gallen J (appeal
from M 1357/93 & others, 27 September 1993)</EM><P>
This was a challenge to the distribution of quota from the
Sealord settlement. The Commission
had decided on a temporary compromise for the 1993-94 season
allocating 50% of deepwater
quota on a mana whenua mana moana basis, and 50% on a population
basis. The former
allocation was challenged in the High Court, which required
undertakings as to liability for
damages from the challengers. That requirement was appealed.
<P>
Held; denying the appeal, that there was no evidence the
Commission had not properly
addressed
criteria it was required to, including Maori custom, economic and
social considerations and
equity, fairness and reasonableness between iwi. Since the
compromise was temporary it does
not appear to be open to a legal attack of any strength.

regarding with
Her Royal Favour the Native Chiefs and Tribes of New Zealand and anxious to protect their
just
Rights and Property and to secure to them the enjoyment of Peace and Good Order has
deemed it

settled in New Zealand and the rapid extension of Emigration both from Europe and Australia
which is still in progress to constitute and appoint a functionary properly authorised to
treat with the Aborigines of New Zealand for the recognition of Her Majesty's Sovereign
authority over the whole or any part of those islands -Her Majesty therefore being desirous to
establish a settled form of Civil Government with a view to avert the evil consequences which
must result from the absence off the necessary Laws and Institutions alike to the native
population and to Her subjects has been graciously please to empower and to authorise me
William Hobson a Captain in Her Majesty's Royal Navy Consul and Lieutenant Governor of
such
parts of New Zealand as may be or hereafter shall be ceded to Her Majesty to invite the
confederated and independent Chiefs of New Zealand to concur in the following Articles and
Conditions.

which the said Confederation or Individual Chiefs respectively exercise or possess, or may be
supposed to exercise or to possess over their respective Territories as the sole Sovereigns
thereof.<P>


<EM>ARTICLE THE SECOND</EM><P>

Her Majesty the Queen of England confirms and guarantees to the Chiefs and Tribes of New
Zealand and to the respective families and individuals thereof the full exclusive and
undisturbed possession of their Land and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which
they may collectively or individually possess so long as it is their wish and desire to retain
the same in their possession; but the Chiefs of the United Tribes and the individual Chiefs
yield to Her Majesty the exclusive right of Preemption over such lands as the proprietors
thereof may be disposed to alienate at such prices as may be agreed upon between the
respective Proprietors and persons appointed by Her Majesty to treat with them in that
behalf.<P>


<EM>ARTICLE THE THIRD
</EM><P>
In consideration thereof Her Majesty the Queen of England extends to the natives of New
Zealand Her royal protection and imparts to them all the Rights and Privileges of British
Subjects.
<P>

<P>
Now therefore We the Chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand being
assembled in Congress at Victoria in Waitangi and We the Separate and Independent Chiefs of
New
Zealand claiming authority over the Tribes and Territories which are specified after our
respective names, having been made fully to understand the Provisions of the foregoing
Treaty,
accept and enter into the same in the full spirit and meaning thereof:  in witness of which we

<H2>Garamond Macron Font</H2>
<PRE>

</PRE>
The Maori Language Commission has adopted a system for writing maori words
 which involves the use of dashes above certain vowels to indicate the vowel
 should be extended in the spoken usage. These dashes are called
 <I>macrons</I>. Some authers use double letters to indicate the same thing,
 eg <I>maaori</I>.
<P>
In order to use macrons on a personal computer you must first install a font
 which includes these macronized letters. We use a macronized Garamond font in
 the printed version of <I>The Maori Law Review</I>.
<P>
To install our Garamond macron font in your Windows based system follow these steps:

<P>
<IMG SRC="images/square.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=20 ALT="* "> &nbsp;
Download the <A HREF="garamacr.zip">zipped macron font</A>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/square.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=20 ALT="* "> &nbsp;
Unzip the file into a temporary folder/directory using PKunzip or similar utility.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/square.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=20 ALT="* "> &nbsp;
Open the Windows Control Panel, then run the Font utility to install the font.

			<P>In mid-1995, a small group of forward thinking people at
			The Clarke foresaw the tremendous potential of the emerging
			new media to contribute to patient care, education and
			research in mental health. After serious thought and
			discussion, our Senior Management Group and Board of
			Trustees committed to give this project their unqualified
			support.</P>
			
			<P>In these difficult economic times, however, it was a
			particularly challenging decision to invest in the
			development of innovative uses of internet technologies to
			distribute information and create dynamic new services for
			our patients, their caregivers and the wide range of
			professionals with whom we work.</P>
			
			<P>Fortunately, a group of dedicated volunteers and generous
			corporate patrons saw the tremendous value of our internet
			project and immediately leaped to the task of bringing it to
			life. </P>
			
			<P>We are deeply grateful to these people and organizations.
			Without their generous donations of time, money, and in-kind
			resources we simply wouldn't be here today.</P>
			
			<P>These individuals deserve particular recognition for
			their generous support and contributions:</P>

			<TD><P><B>In Celebration of the Year of the Ox</B></P>
			
			<P>Each year, The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry Foundation
			presents its annual dinner in celebration of the Chinese New
			Year. The event consists of a traditional lion dance
			followed by a multi-course Chinese dinner, door prizes and
			raffle.</P>
			
			<P>This year's dinner -- in celebration of the Year of the
			Ox -- is tentatively scheduled for February 19, 1997 at the
			Lai Wah Heen restaurant in the Metropolitan Hotel in
			Toronto. Tickets for the dinner at $138 and raffle tickets
			will be available from the Foundation office (phone:
			416-979-6909, fax: 979-6910) in December, 1996.</P>
			
			<P>With support from the community, the event seeks to raise
			about $40,000 which will benefit The Clarke's Culture,
			Community and Health Studies Program and its efforts to make
			the healthcare system more accessible for immigrants,
			refugees and others whose culture and language may reduce
			the accessibility and effectiveness of mental healthcare
			services.</P>
			
			<P>The dinner is open to all members of the community and is
			attended by people from Chinese, Asian and other
			communities, politicians, business executives, Clarke staff
			and others who support improved delivery and access to
			mental healthcare for Canadians from a variety of ethnic
			backgrounds.</P>
			
			<P><B>Goals:</B></P>
			
			<UL>
				<LI>Raise funds to support The Clarke's Culture, Community and Health Studies Program;
				<LI>Increase awareness of The Clarke and its programs to ethno-cultural groups, particularly the Chinese community;
				<LI>Destigmatize mental illness so that members of ethno-cultural communities who suffer from mental illness will be more willing to come forward for treatment.
			</UL>
			
			<P>Corporate sponsorship opportunities for the Chinese New
			Year 's Dinner are available by calling The Clarke
			Foundation at (416) 979-6909.</P>

			<TD><P><B>Mental Illness Statistics</B></P>
			
			<P>Recent survey data indicate that 20% of Canada's adult
			population suffered from a mental disorder or drug abuse
			within the past year. Schizophrenia affects over 200 000
			Canadians. Major depression and manic depression affect 36%
			of Canadians and anxiety disorders double that number. At
			least 25% of the medically ill have a treatable psychiatric
			disorder.</P>
			
			<P>The costs of mental illness are immense. For example,
			approximately one-quarter of all hospital days reported in
			Canada are for in-patient management of mental disorders.
			Furthermore, only 20-25% of the total costs of schizophrenia
			and depression to society are direct treatment costs; the
			remaining 75-80% of costs are incurred due to lost social
			and economic productivity. In the case of children, if
			effective interventions are not obtained, the mental, social
			and economic burden of suffering can continue throughout
			their lifetime. But according to the Ontario Child Health
			Study, though almost 20% of Ontario's children need care,
			only one in six is receiving it.</P>
			
			<P>Despite the enormous cost of mental illness, our society
			still spends relatively little to research its causes and
			treatments. Current research expenditures represent only a
			few dollars per patient while by contrast in many physical
			illnesses the comparable figure is over $1 000.00 per
			patient.

			<P>Upon arrival at the Institute, patients are requested to
			go to the Admitting Department on the ground floor, between
			9 am and 5 pm Please be sure to bring your health insurance
			card or private insurance information. If you are an Ontario
			resident covered by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, OHIP
			will cover all standard costs of your hospital care, as well
			as your physician's services. If you are a Canadian resident
			covered by other provincial health care plans, it is
			essential for you to seek prior approval from your home
			province health care department before receiving psychiatric
			treatment at The Clarke.</P>
			
			<P>If you are a non-resident of Canada and covered by
			private health insurance, please check with your insurance
			company to ensure that psychiatric treatment is covered by
			your insurance policy.</P>
			
			<P>The Clarke has four-bed, two or three-bed (semi-private),
			and some single (private) rooms. Assignment of rooms is made
			according to the individual needs of patients and the
			availability of beds. Accommodation costs will be charged
			for semi-private and private rooms on a daily basis. These
			charges are usually not covered by provincial health care
			plans. You, or your private health insurance company, if
			any, will be billed for those costs, unless this
			accommodation was required as part of your treatment.</P>

			<P><B>Medication</B></P>
			
			<P>Any medication you have been taking at home should be
			brought to the hospital and given to your nurse at the time
			of admission. Your physician will supervise all medications
			while in the Institute. Be sure to inform him/her of any
			medication taken prior to hospitalization, including
			over-the-counter medicines such as aspirin, vitamins, or
			herbal preparations. The medication you bring to the
			hospital will be kept for you during your stay and may be
			returned to you on discharge if your doctor feels you should
			continue with the same medication. Otherwise, a discharge
			prescription for your new medication will be provided by the
			hospital pharmacy. If you have any questions or concerns
			about medication, please feel free to ask staff. Educational
			literature is available regarding many medications.</P>

		<IMG ALT="" SRC="images/spacer.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20><BR>
		<A NAME="treatment"><IMG ALT="The Treatment Team" SRC="images/treatment.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26></A>

			<P>During your stay, a multidisciplinary team will be
			assigned to assist in your care. The team consists of
			physicians, nurses, social worker, and frequently, an
			occupational therapist, pharmacist, psychologist, or
			recreational therapist.</P>
			
			<P>Soon after your admission you will be seen by a staff
			psychiatrist or a psychiatric resident. The staff
			psychiatrist is a member of the treatment team who will
			assess your problems and will direct your treatment. The
			psychiatric resident will interview you in detail to learn
			about your illness and a treatment plan will be drawn up
			with the help of the staff psychiatrist, the rest of the
			treatment team, and with your input.</P>
			
			<P>During your inpatient admission at The Clarke, you will
			be working closely with many of the nursing staff on your
			unit on an individual basis and as participants in group
			programs. The goal of nursing staff on your unit is to
			assist you in achieving the highest possible state of
			health. You will be assigned a primary nurse who, with your
			participation, will develop a plan of nursing care with you.
			Nursing staff will work with you to help identify and
			achieve treatment goals which may be appropriate during your
			admission or following discharge. Nursing staff will ensure
			that your care by other members of your treatment team is
			provided in a coordinated fashion.</P>
			
			<P>Social workers work with patients individually and with
			their families to assist them in understanding and dealing
			with illness. Social workers are employed throughout the
			Institute and are involved in program planning, research and
			education, as well as individual, group, and family
			treatment. A patient's discharge plan is coordinated by a
			social worker. This may include follow-up treatment in the
			community, referrals for housing, employment, and income
			maintenance.</P>
			
			<P>Occupational therapists provide programming to help build
			supports and skills to improve your daily life. Individual
			treatment goals might include: returning to work, building a
			daily routine for your activities, or learning life
			skills.</P>
			
			<P>Recreation therapists provide a wide range of activities
			that offer opportunity for challenge, expression, and
			relaxation.</P>
			
			<P>All prescribed medication is supplied by the Pharmacy
			Department. Pharmacists monitor drug therapy, provide drug
			information and counsel on drug use. Pharmacists provide
			drug education groups on several Units. Specific issues
			pertaining to your drug treatment can be discussed with the
			pharmacist on request.</P>
			
			<P>The team may also include a psychologist who conducts
			tests which aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. They
			also provide individual and group therapy.</P>

			<P><B>If You Are A Relative</B></P>
			
			<P>Family members are important partners in treatment and,
			with a patient's consent, are kept informed of the patient's
			progress by Unit staff. A social worker is available to
			discuss family concerns and family group support programs
			are available. Frequent educational seminars are offered to
			help patients and families understand and deal with illness.
			Educational literature is also available on various mental
			illnesses and medications.</P>
			
			<P><B>Students &amp; Research</B></P>
			
			<P>As a teaching hospital, The Clarke provides training for
			resident psychiatrists. Residents are qualified physicians
			who are completing post-graduate training in psychiatry.
			During your stay, you may be cared for by a resident
			psychiatrist who will be supervised by a staff psychiatrist.
			As well, students in many other health disciplines receive
			training at The Clarke and are involved in the care of
			patients. Patients often find involvement with students both
			enriching and rewarding.</P>
			
			<P>Since The Clarke is a research Institute, some of our
			patients have the opportunity to participate in research
			projects. The purpose of research is to improve
			understanding, treatment and outcome of mental illness.
			Future generations will benefit from research being carried
			on now. Participation in research projects is entirely
			voluntary, and your care during treatment, or acceptance
			into treatment, is not dependent on participation. Please
			feel comfortable to ask questions so that you fully
			understand the research projects being carried out. Many
			patients appreciate the learning opportunity provided by
			participation in research. In turn, we appreciate patients'
			important contribution to this work. Again, participation is
			voluntary and choosing not to take part will not affect your
			care.</P>
			
			<P><B>Unit Programs</B></P>
			
			<P>Each Unit offers a treatment program which will likely
			include participation in a variety of ward activities such
			as support groups, life skills classes, and education
			sessions. As well, recreational activities are organized
			within the hospital and community. Please feel comfortable
			to ask staff about various therapeutic and recreational
			activities and to participate fully in the available
			activities. During your stay, you may visit the public areas
			of the hospital, go on outings and spend weekends at home,
			depending on your condition and after discussion with staff.
			Most Units have a sign-out book near the exit. It is very
			important to indicate your whereabouts in this book when
			leaving the Unit for any reason.</P>

		<IMG ALT="" SRC="images/spacer.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20><BR>
		<A NAME="patients_rights"><IMG ALT="Patients' Rights" SRC="images/patients_rights.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26></A>

			<P>The Mental Health Act of Ontario contains specific
			regulations under which mental health facilities must
			operate. These regulations are carefully formulated to
			protect the patient's legal rights and to promote the
			patient's best interests. Many individual procedures require
			a patient's written consent.</P>
			
			<P>Most patients enter The Clarke of their own accord. This
			is referred to as a voluntary admission. Sometimes, because
			of the nature of the illness, a person may not realize the
			need for psychiatric help. In such cases, a physician or
			justice of the peace may complete an application requesting
			that the patient be assessed at a psychiatric facility.
			Following assessment, the Mental Health Act specifies some
			of the obligations and responsibilities under which mental
			health professionals provide service. All efforts are made
			to inform patients of their condition, to ensure they
			participate in treatment decisions, and to protect their
			rights and interests.</P>
			
			<P>Sometimes patients will require an assessment for
			competency to manage their own financial affairs. It is
			recommended that a patient appoint a substitute
			decision-maker (personal representative) to help in
			determining and carrying out the most appropriate treatment
			plan.</P>
			
			<P>A booklet is available on each Unit "Rights and
			Responsibilities: A Guide to the Mental Health Act",
			explaining the provisions of the Mental Health Act in detail
			and patients and their families are encouraged to become
			familiar with its contents. Under the Mental Health Act,
			some patients have the right to appeal to a Review Board for
			hearings on their right to consent to their stay in
			hospital, their treatment or to manage their finances. In
			such circumstances, a Rights Advisor is available through
			the office of the Executive V.P./C.O.O., 979-4747 ext. 2429.
			Please feel free to ask staff any questions you have
			regarding legal concerns.</P>

			<P><B>Employment</B></P>
			
			<P>The Work Adjustment and Employment Support Program is a
			mental health service funded by the Ministry of Health and
			located at The Clarke to assist persons with significant
			mental health problems to enter and maintain employment and
			training.</P>
			
			<P><B>Schooling</B></P>
			
			<P>The College Street Secondary School of the Toronto Board
			of Education is located at The Clarke and is available to
			referred patients wishing to continue their education during
			or after their hospital stay. The School gives patients the
			opportunity to work on secondary school credits and to
			develop computer and artistic skills.</P>
			
			<P><B>Religious Services</B></P>
			
			<P>The Institute Chaplain is available to help address your
			spiritual concerns. You may arrange to have the chaplain
			visit you by requesting an appointment through Unit staff or
			by calling his office at extension 2355. A weekly interfaith
			Sunday service is held at 11:00 am in Room 853. The chaplain
			can also direct you, on request, to a priest, rabbi, imam,
			or other faith-group leader.</P>
			
			<P><B>Parking</B></P>
			
			<P>Patients should leave their cars at home while in
			hospital. There is limited metered parking near the
			Institute on Spadina and on municipal lots off Spadina south
			of the Institute. The underground parkade behind the
			Institute, accessible off Spadina, charges an hourly rate,
			but is generally full during the day. Toronto Transit
			Commission buses and streetcars run from the Spadina and
			Queen's Park subway stations and stop at the corner of
			Spadina and College, which is only steps away from The
			Clarke.</P>
			
			<P><B>Appointments Outside The Institute</B></P>
			
			<P>Some tests and procedures may have to be carried out in
			other facilities or clinics. Relatives may be asked to
			assist by accompanying patients to these special
			appointments.</P>
			
			<P><B>Interpreters</B></P>
			
			<P>Interpreting services can be arranged if no family member
			is available to help.</P>
			
			<P><B>Volunteers</B></P>
			
			<P>The Clarke is most grateful to our volunteers, who
			contribute so much to the care of clients. Volunteers offer
			individual and group activities that enhance the quality of
			life for clients in hospital. In addition, they run
			institute-wide social/recreational activities on weekends
			and in the evenings. Ask a member of your treatment team for
			more information about volunteer services.</P>

			<P><B>Visitors</B></P>
			
			<P>Family and friends are encouraged to visit patients as
			often as desired. Children are welcome on most Units.
			Because the patients are usually busy with tests or
			treatment activities during the weekdays, most visiting
			hours are in the late afternoon or evening. However,
			flexible arrangements can be made for out-of-town visitors
			and special circumstances. The usual visiting hours on the
			Units are listed below. It is a good idea for visitors to
			check with the Unit first by phone to confirm visiting hours
			at any given time.</P>

			<P><B>Smoking and Alcohol</B></P>
			
			<P>To protect the health of patients, the Institute has a No
			Smoking policy. There are, however, certain designated areas
			on the patient units, where smoking is permitted by
			inpatients only.</P>
			
			<P>Use of non-prescribed drugs and alcohol is not allowed in
			the Institute. During your stay, consumption of alcohol
			outside the Institute should be discussed with your
			doctor.</P>
			
			<P><B>Patient &amp; Staff Safety</B></P>
			
			<P>Every effort is made to ensure the safety of all patients
			and staff at the Institute. Violent or abusive behaviour is
			not tolerated.</P>
			
			<P><B>Fire</B></P>
			
			<P>Unit staff will inform you of procedures to follow in the
			event of fire. Fire drills are performed regularly.</P>
			
			<P><B>Inquiries</B></P>
			
			<P>Privacy and confidentiality of our patients is strictly
			respected. Inquiries regarding patient status will only be
			provided to designated persons when visiting the Units, in
			keeping with patient wishes.</P>
			
			<P><B>Discharge</B></P>
			
			<P>Your doctor and treatment team will discuss plans for
			your discharge with you well in advance, so that the most
			appropriate arrangements can be made. Your Unit Social
			Worker can help you with planning for discharge and link you
			with follow-up treatment in the community, support groups,
			and referrals for housing, employment, and income
			maintenance.</P>
			
			<P>To allow for preparations for incoming patients, we
			prefer discharged patients leave in the morning, but these
			hours vary according to the Unit. Please ensure you have all
			your personal belongings. Any articles left in the Institute
			are kept for 30 days and are then donated to a charitable
			organization. If applicable, stop at the Accounting Office
			(2nd Floor) to settle your accounts and/or pick up any
			valuable left for safekeeping. If you have a large amount of
			money deposited with the Accounting Office, it is advisable
			for you to inform Accounting in advance to make arrangements
			for withdrawal.</P>

			<P>The causes, symptoms, treatments, and long-term outcome
			of most mental illnesses are only beginning to be
			understood.  Only research will lead us to a full
			understanding of these illnesses so that improved treatments
			can be found, patient care can be improved, and
			professionals can have access to current information.</P>
			
			<P>Widely recognized as producing some of the finest
			clinical and research programs in the country, Clarke
			research across all disciplines and all levels of analysis
			has contributed significantly to the world-wide
			understanding of psychiatric disorders.</P>
			
			<P>At The Clarke, research is conducted across all clinical
			Divisions and takes many forms. Basic science research using
			state-of-the art technologies is aimed at learning about the
			body chemicals, genetic materials, or brain structures
			involved in psychiatric illnesses. Clinical research
			evaluates how specific treatments are working in practice.
			Qualitative methods are used to learn more about the
			subjective experience of clients with mental health
			problems. Community research surveys broad populations to
			provide information about the extent, nature, and severity
			of psychiatric disability, as the basis for providing
			services.</P>
			
			<P>Twelve sections within The Clarke's Research Dvision
			focus exclusively on research. These sections (described
			below) are affiliated with the University of Toronto's
			Departments of Psychiatry, Physiology, Pharmacology,
			Psychology, and Institute of Medical Sciences, and as such,
			provide a rich environment for training at the graduate and
			post-graduate levels.</P>
			
			<P>The Research Division receives major sponsorship from the
			Medical Research Council of Canada, National Institutes of
			Health, Natural Sciences &amp; Engineering Research Council,
			Ontario Mental Health Foundation, and many other granting
			bodies. In addition, The Clarke actively seeks public,
			private, industry, and government involvement.</P>

			<P>Researchers in the Biochemical Psychiatry Section
			investigate biochemical abnormalities underlying psychiatric
			disorders, with particular emphasis on mood disorders. Under
			the leadership of Dr. Jerry Warsh, researchers are currently
			focusing on the role of biochemical processes in bipolar
			affective disorder and on understanding how mood-stabilizing
			agents affect those processes to produce their beneficial
			effects.</P>
			
			<P>Work on bipolar affective disorder builds on direct
			findings from a series of landmark studies by a team from
			the Section and the Mood Disorders Clinic, showing
			disturbances in intracellular signalling. Initial findings
			of abnormally high levels of certain G-proteins in the
			brains and white blood cells of people diagnosed with
			bipolar disorder, and later evidence of alterations in other
			signal-transducing proteins, point to an array of
			disturbances in critical brain cell signalling pathways in
			the illness. These findings have important theoretical,
			diagnostic, and treatment implications. Researchers are
			seeking to determine whether these disturbances are the core
			of the disease or the result of other processes, whether
			they occur only in specific phases of the illness, and
			whether the phenomenon is unique to bipolar disorder.</P>
			
			<P>Research on mood-stabilizing medications suggests they
			improve the efficiency of the interaction between G-proteins
			and other signalling proteins. One aspect of future research
			is developing therapeutic agents targeted at these
			signalling disturbances, which are more effective and
			produce fewer side effects.</P>
			
			<P>Disturbances in intracellular signalling have also been
			found in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia,
			specifically disturbances in phospholipid-dependent
			intracellular communication which may contribute to the
			promotion or development of schizophrenia.</P>

			<P>The Biopsychology Section conducts research on the
			biological foundations of both normal and pathological
			behaviours relevant to psychiatry. Led by Dr. Paul Fletcher,
			a major focus of this work is the role various neurochemical
			systems (serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and neuropeptide Y) play
			in controlling behaviour. A clearer understanding of the
			link between neurochemical functioning and behaviour lays
			the groundwork for designing more selective drugs for
			treating psychiatric disorders.</P>
			
			<P>One major research area in the section is the
			neurochemical basis of impulsivity which is characterized by
			a loss of behavioral control, a need for immediate
			gratification, active sensation-seeking, and an exaggerated
			response to pleasurable or 'rewarding' stimuli. Impulsivity
			is associated with suicide, aggression, alcoholism,
			substance abuse, bulimia, anxiety, and depression. Because
			reduced serotonin functioning has been linked to all these
			conditions, current research is studying the relationship
			between impulsive behaviour and alterations in the highly
			complex serotonin system - in particular, identifying where
			in the brain disturbances in serotonin function lead to
			impulsive behaviour. The goal is to determine why the
			serotonin system is functioning differently and whether
			compensatory interventions could change these problematic
			behaviours. Impulsive behaviours are evident early in life;
			Dr. Fletcher is investigating how drug and environmental
			manipulations which alter the development of serotonin
			neurons affect adult behaviour.</P>
			
			<P>Dr. Fletcher is also examining the effects on behaviour
			of the interplay between serotonin systems and other
			neurotransmitter systems dopamine, GABA, and neuropeptide Y.
			This work has implications for understanding and treating
			drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and bulimia respectively.</P>
			
			<P>Other collaborative projects include the development of a
			novel model of Alzheimer's disease, and transgenic research
			investigating the role of dopamine D1 receptors in reward
			and cognitive processes.</P>

			<P>Informing and improving systems of mental health service

			Unit, the base of the Department of Psychiatry's Mental
			Health Systems Research and Development Program.</P>
			
			<P>Headed by Dr. Paula Goering, the interdisciplinary team
			draws on the experience of other progressive jurisdictions,
			reviews current literature, interviews and consults with
			local stakeholders, analyses data in existing administrative
			databases, and gathers information through epidemiological
			and program evaluation studies. To maximize the possibility
			of these findings being disseminated and translated into
			policy and practice, investigators in the Unit regularly
			assume additional roles as administrators, planners,
			consultants, and advocates, to influence decision-making in
			the education, health care and government arenas. The Clarke
			Institute Consulting Group, based in the Unit, provides a
			vehicle for transferring knowledge and for keeping the
			research staff in touch with 'front line' service delivery
			issues and problems.</P>
			
			<P>Researchers from the Unit have been actively involved in
			all phases of the mental health reform process in Ontario --
			from formulation of principles through to implementation.
			Throughout the reform process, working papers produced by
			the Health Systems Research Unit have formed the basis for
			much of the policy underscoring the implementation of mental
			health reform. To inform planning and policy for mental
			health reform, a team of psychiatric researchers from the
			Unit and McMaster University designed, conducted, and
			analysed the most comprehensive population-based study of
			mental disorder ever undertaken in Ontario as the the basis
			for future Ministry of Health planning. The study, the
			Mental Health Supplement to the Ontario Health Survey,
			gathered information from nearly 10,000 Ontarians to provide
			data about the extent, nature, and severity of psychiatric
			disability, and a picture of mental health care utilization
			in Ontario.</P>

			<P>Researchers in the Molecular Psychobiology section
			investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the cause,
			expression, and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases such
			as schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, drug addiction,
			and psychomotor diseases. Led by Dr. Chaim Niznik and Dr.
			Hubert Van Tol, current research centres on abnormal
			functioning of the dopamine system -- known to be integrally
			involved in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, cocaine
			abuse, and schizophrenia. Researchers working on
			identifying, characterizing, and assessing biochemical
			abnormalities in dopamine receptors and transporters have
			shown that receptors for dopamine exist in at least five
			genetically-determined variants, cloned four of those
			variants, and shown that receptor function is markedly
			different in schizophrenic brain.</P>
			
			<P>Dr. Niznik's current and future research is directed
			toward further investigating the two variants of the D1
			receptor gene (D1 and D5), which his team was the first to
			isolate. D1 genes and protein products are associated with
			movement disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychomotor
			events. Dr. Niznik's group is also studying the role of at
			least three more, as yet uncharacterized, variants of D1.
			His work analyzing the chemical and structural composition
			of the dopamine receptors and transporters and the
			mechanisms by which the dopamine receptors and transporter
			interact, may form the basis for the development of drugs
			for treating schizophrenia and motor disorders following
			neuroleptic treatment, and may contribute to improved
			treatments for attention deficit disorders and Parkinson's
			disease. Ultimately, this paves the way for gene replacement
			therapies. In other work, Dr. Niznik is collaboratively
			analyzing the molecular structure and function of the
			transporter to generate laboratory screening systems for
			studying the dopamine uptake process.</P>
			
			<P>Dr. Van Tol was a member of the group which first cloned
			the D2 receptor -- work which resulted in the subsequent
			cloning of four of the five known dopamine receptors (he has
			been involved in cloning all four). In contrast to the D1
			and D2 receptors, little is known about the functions of the
			novel dopamine receptors. Dr. Van Tol's group was the first
			to clone the novel variant of the D2-type receptor, D4,
			which is thought to play an important role in schizophrenia.
			His research has implicated this variant as a potentially
			important target for treating the disorder. His current
			investigations involve:</P>

			<P>PET is an imaging technology which allows scientists to
			examine chemical processes in live, conscious patients.
			Qualitatively different from other imaging technologies --
			CT or MRI scanning -- which show anatomical structure rather
			than chemical activity, PET allows researchers to examine in
			fine detail biological cellular functions in healthy and
			diseased brains. Used in psychiatric research, it allows
			researchers to determine which chemical messengers are
			malfunctioning and helps identify how the malfunction can be
			corrected. Brain studies made possible through PET improve
			the understanding of psychiatric illnesses such as
			schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, anxiety disorders,
			and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
			
			<P>PET has added immeasurably to knowledge of brain
			transmission mechanisms and to understanding how and where
			psychoactive drugs work. New areas of research are
			constantly being developed, among them speech and language
			disorders, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, and the
			possible physiological bases for addictions. In addition to
			its application to pathology, PET is being applied to
			improving understanding of normal cognitive functions --
			speech, learning, memory, vision, perception.</P>
			
			<P>The PET Centre is a University of Toronto facility,
			funded by the Ministry of Health and located at The Clarke
			to serve the teaching hospital research network. Headed by
			Dr. Sylvain Houle, the Centre is the first of its kind in
			Toronto and one of only four in Canada. The juxtaposition of
			the Centre with other research technologies employed at The
			Clarke, provides a unique environment for research across
			technologies and disciplines.</P>

			<P>Transgenics research, one of the fastest-growing new
			areas in scientific research, is a means of learning about
			the role of genes in both normal and abnormal behaviour via
			live models. By manipulating genetic makeup -- 'knocking
			out' (removing) identified genes or introducing diseased
			genes at either the embryonic or adult stage, researchers
			will mimic disorders in animals. With these models,
			researchers can use experimental approaches not possible in
			humans to directly study the relationship between genes and
			behaviour, to observe the effects of medications, learn
			about genes whose function is currently unknown, and
			differentiate developmental effects from gene-induced
			effects. Transgenics links genetics, neurochemistry, and
			behaviour in a coherent framework.</P>
			
			<P>Used for psychiatric research, investigators hope to
			pinpoint the genes responsible for such disorders as
			schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness, as the basis for
			designing more directly-targeted drugs which treat illnesses
			more effectively and with fewer side effects. Ultimately the
			goal is gene replacement therapy -- replacing disease genes
			with healthy genes that stabilize the system to eliminate
			disease.</P>
			
			<P>The new transgenics facility at The Clarke -- one of the
			few such labs in Canada exclusively focused on psychiatric
			disease -- will be a vital resource for all basic research
			sections and will stimulate linkages across sections
			allowing departments to share findings.</P>

			<P>Research led by Dr. Brenda Toner, examines psychological
			and social variables affecting women's mental health and the
			interplay between these and physiological factors in the
			onset, expression and treatment of mental illnesses. Among
			those variables being investigated are poverty, low self
			esteem, gender-role conflict, and physical, sexual and

			functional bowel disorders.</P>
			
			<P>The Women's Mental Health Program collaborates with other
			related programs on a range of research, educational, and
			clinical endeavours and actively sponsors formal linkages
			with a variety of community agencies. Dr. Toner has also
			organized a University of Toronto, city-wide Women's Mental
			Health interest group which examines such issues as gender
			biases in mental health training and practice, sexual
			harassment, sexual and physical abuse, integrating feminist
			principles into traditional therapies, expression of
			psychiatric disorders in women, and ethnicity and
			gender.</P>

			<P><B>Vision Statement:</B></P>
			
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry Foundation seeks to
			become the premier fundraising organization in North America
			for psychiatric research, education and patient care.</P>
			
			<P><B>Mission Statement:</B></P>
			
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry Foundation is a
			fundraising and granting organization dedicated to the
			betterment of the mental health of the people of Ontario and
			Canada.</P>
			
			<P>The Foundation accomplishes its task by promoting and
			enhancing The Clarke, and by raising funds to support The
			Clarke's work in research, education and patient care.</P>
			
			<P><B>Role:</B></P>
			
			<P>The role of the Foundation is to enhance The Clarke's
			public image, credibility and resources through:</P>
			
			<UL>
				<LI>Building a base of contacts and supporters in selected communities.
				<LI>Creating alliances with mental health organizations.
				<LI>Participating in public education and fundraising events.
				<LI>Organizing, planning and implementing fundraising programs.
				<LI>Investing financial resources in research and educational programs.

			<TD><P><A NAME="overview"><IMG ALT="Overview"
				SRC="../images/overview.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0></A></P>
			
			<P>The challenges facing mental health providers and
			agencies -- universal government restraint, societal
			misunderstanding of mental health issues and chronic
			underfunding of research -- are not insurmountable. Given
			these restraints, The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry aims to
			focus on the areas of greatest need to the community with
			respect to its own particular areas of expertise. It also
			aspires to maximize its effectiveness through stronger
			partnerships with other stakeholders in the mental health
			community. The Clarke's role as the primary teaching
			hospital for the University of Toronto's Department of
			Psychiatry -- a strategic hub within the healthcare system
			-- already serves this goal.</P>
			
			<P>To reach these strategic goals, The Clarke Institute of
			Psychiatry Foundation has initiated a campaign to fund
			chairs in mood disorders, schizophrenia and anxiety
			disorders and professorships in women's mental health and
			psychiatric nursing. Other priorities include the
			establishment of directorships in General Psychiatry and
			Child &amp; Family and programs which support children and
			adolescents.</P>
			
		<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
			<TD><P><A NAME="healthcare"><IMG ALT="Healthcare Challenges"
				SRC="../images/healthcare.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0></A></P>
			
			<P>The escalating cost of servicing the provincial deficit,
			flat government revenues and decreasing provincial transfer
			payments from Ottawa have all had a significant impact on
			healthcare funding. As a result, rationalization,
			integration, regionalization and restructuring are
			continuing to challenge the roles of health, research and
			educational agencies and their boards.</P>
			
			<P>Between 1992 and 1995, The Clarke's operating grants from
			the Ministry of Health decreased by 6.3%. In addition, the
			provincial government announced that funds transferred to
			Ontario hospitals will decrease by 18% during 1996 to 1999.
			Despite these cuts, The Clarke's budget for the 1996/97
			fiscal year will remain intact.</P>
			
			<P>Mental illness research has historically been underfunded
			by government and external granting agencies. (Canadians
			spend about $4 per patient per year on research into mental
			illness compared to about $1,000 to $2,000 per patient per
			year for other diseases.) Unlike other major disease groups,
			the mentally ill form a weak constituency; in fact, many of
			them are too sick to lobby for more funds or are simply
			unwilling to take their cause public as a result of
			stigma.</P>

			<TD><P><A NAME="clarkes_response"><IMG ALT="The Clarke's Response"
				SRC="../images/clarkes_response.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0></A></P>
			
			<P>The Clarke's response to these healthcare challenges is
			laid out in its five-year strategic plan. Priorities
			outlined in this plan include:</P>
			
			<UL>
				<LI>Maintaining the commitment to basic research, focussing
					on the areas of highest public need and greatest expertise
					of The Clarke;
				
				<LI>Increasing integration of research, education and
					clinical care and enhancing the multidisciplinary healthcare
					model;
				
				<LI>Strengthening partnerships with external stakeholders
					and subsequently improving the efficiency and effectiveness
					of the mental health care system;
				
				<LI>Improving technological infrastructure to enhance
					research, care and education.
			</UL>
			
			<P>The Clarke's multidisciplinary approach to care has led
			to a dramatically reduced length-of-stay median of only 16
			days, which allows mental health professionals to help more
			people in less time. Improved linkages with caregivers in
			the community have also eased the burden on
			resource-intensive hospital care. In addition, its
			complimentary commitment to research and education has
			helped The Clarke maintain a leadership position in clinical
			care.</P>
			
			<P>The research arm of The Clarke has proven itself as a
			world leader. In the last five years, for example, funding
			for research from external granting bodies has increased by
			53% from $3.8 million to $7.4 million. The Clarke has
			particular expertise in the fields of psychosomatic
			medicine, eating disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders,
			multicultural psychiatry and basic pharmacology. Other areas
			growing in importance include women's health, brain imaging,
			and mental health and the law.</P>
			
			<P>Despite the uncertainty prevailing in the healthcare
			system, The Clarke Institute has established itself as a
			strong and stable force working on behalf of the mentally
			ill and the community-at-large.</P>

				SRC="../images/priorities_2000.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0></A></P>
			
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry has embarked on a
			campaign to fund chairs in schizophrenia, mood disorders and
			anxiety disorders. These are permanent positions, funded by
			endowments of $2.2 million per chair which are designed to
			attract and retain world-class scientists.</P>
			
			<P><B>A chair is leadership.</B> Establishment of a chair lets the
			scientific community and others know that The Clarke is
			serious about reducing the pain of people who suffer from
			mental illness and discovering improved treatments and
			cures. A chair will have a galvanizing effect for many
			physicians scattered throughout the community who carry out
			research on a part-time basis. A chair is a coordinator, a
			guide, a resource, an advocate and most of all, a
			leader.</P>
			
			<P><B>A chair is an investment.</B> Research funding flows from
			several sources including government, the Medical Research
			Council, hospitals and donors. They give money to research
			that others have made a clear priority. When the Medical
			Research Council has money to disburse, for example, it will
			look to The Clarke's $2.2 million endowments and recognize
			this research as a national priority. If an advocacy group
			has money to fund a promising young scientist as a research
			fellow, they will look to the chair and recognize its
			leadership. Closer to home, if a donor wants to end the
			suffering of a family member, he or she will recognize the
			chair and the hope that comes with it. A chair is a true
			compounding investment.</P>
			
			<P><B>A chair is hope.</B> A chair is hope because an
			internationally-renowned researcher appointed to a chair is
			committed to one disease. Many medical researchers adopt a
			&quot;bottom-up&quot; approach in their work, tracing a
			particular chemical in the brain, for example, rather than
			focussing on a single disease. Chairs mean a
			&quot;top-down&quot; approach. A person holding the chair in
			schizophrenia, for example, will focus and guide diverse
			research efforts towards this disease. Moreover, an
			endowment means that this effort will continue unimpeded by
			government cutbacks. At a time when talented medical leaders
			are being lured away, an endowment will attract and retain
			the best and the brightest.</P>

					SRC="../images/other_priorities.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0></A></P>
			
			<P><B>Directorship: Child and Family Division</B></P>
			
			<P>A large proportion of children who need treatment, but do
			not get it, may experience life-long, chronic mental health
			problems. In order to improve the delivery of mental
			healthcare to children, The Clarke is planning to merge its
			Child and Family Division with its Child and Family Studies
			Centre and Family Court Clinic. This new strategic alliance
			will ensure the continuing care of children with psychiatric
			disorders and children affected by the divorce of their
			parents.</P>
			
			<P><I>Five-year term: $500,000</I></P>
			
			<P><B>Directorship: General Psychiatry Division</B></P>
			
			<P>In response to concern with the growing subspecialization
			in psychiatry at the expense of general, hospital-based
			psychiatry, The Clarke created a new General Psychiatry
			Division in 1993. It is designed to respond to any patient
			in psychiatric crisis who &quot;comes through the door&quot;
			and provide access to a high standard of multidisciplinary,
			integrated care. In addition, it is a rich training ground
			for mental health professionals. A five-year directorship
			will steer this new initiative toward
			&quot;reinventing&quot; general psychiatry.</P>
			
			<P><I>Five-year term: $500,000</I></P>
			
			<P><B>Professorship: Psychiatric Nursing</B></P>
			
			<P>Although medicine is oriented towards the treatment and
			cure of disease and nursing is focused on the individual and
			recovery, research indicates that both of these components
			are required for effective healthcare. In fact, studies
			indicate that high-quality nursing care improves quality of
			life and facilitates recovery. Despite these findings, the
			vast majority of funding is directed towards the study of
			disease and the search for cures while corresponding support
			for nursing research especially in the field of psychiatric
			nursing is virtually nonexistent. The Professorship in
			Nursing will develop structure and studies which integrate
			both behavioural and biological science into the practice of
			nursing and further improve the outcomes for patients who
			suffer from psychiatric illness.</P>
			
			<P><I>Endowment fund: $1.1 million</I></P>
			
			<P><B>Professorship: Women's Mental Health</B></P>
			
			<P>Women are diagnosed more frequently with depression,
			anxiety and eating disorders yet often encounter mental
			health services which are fragmented, difficult to access
			and unsuitable for their needs and circumstances. In
			response to this need, The Clarke seeks to establish a
			Professorship in Women's Mental Health which will help
			create a mental health system which is more responsive to
			the needs of women. In addition, this endowment will raise
			the stature of women's mental health in the field of
			psychiatry and ensure continuing education, research and
			leadership.</P>
			
			<P><I>Endowment fund: $1.1 million</I></P>
			
			<P><B>The Arson Prevention Program for Children (TAPP-C)</B></P>
			
			<P>Juvenile firesetters are responsible for at least
			one-third of intentionally set fires which cause in excess
			of $244 million in damage per year. In fact, fire-related
			injuries are second only to transportation accidents in
			causing deaths among children who are two to four times more
			likely to die in fires than are adults. In response to this
			critical need to help curb children and adolescents from
			starting fires, The Clarke established The Arson Prevention
			Program for Children (TAPP-C) in 1991. This program seeks to
			improve understanding and develop a treatment manual for
			children and adolescents who start fires. TAPP-C plans to
			share its research and treatment procedures with mental
			health professionals throughout Canada during the coming
			year.</P>
			
			<P><I>Annual treatment and educational programs: $150,000</I></P>
			
			<P><B>Baffin Island Suicide Prevention</B></P>
			
			<P>Researchers are looking at major risk factors and more
			effective methods of reducing alarmingly high rates of
			suicide among Inuit communities on Baffin Island. The
			research project will call upon the people of Baffin Island
			in an effort to develop a more community-based model of
			suicide prevention.</P>
			
			<P><I>Research support: $75,000</I></P>
			
			<P><B>For Kid's Sake</B></P>
			
			<P>The For Kid's Sake program focuses on children caught in
			the crossfire of parental conflict and violence during
			divorce. As one of the few prevention and treatment programs
			for high-risk separated families, the program aims to reduce
			court litigation over child custody issues and teach more
			adaptive, non-aggressive models of conflict resolution. The
			long-term goal of the project is to prevent mental health
			problems common among parents and children exposed to overt
			conflict. Additional funding is required to carry out a
			full-scale evaluation of this program's effectiveness as
			part of the process for wide-scale implementation.</P>
			
			<P><I>Research support and equipment: $25,000</I></P>
			
			<P><B>Institute for Antisocial Youth</B></P>
			
			<P>Since 1986, violent crime committed by youths has
			increased by 124% as compared to a 40% increase in crime
			committed by adults. To help reverse this trend, the
			Institute for Antisocial Youth provides training and
			education for mental health professionals, advocates
			continuity of care for antisocial youth and promotes
			prevention of youth crime through research and education.
			Its ultimate goal is to reduce violence in our society.</P>
			
			<P><I>Printing and mailing educational material: $39,000</I></P>

			<TD><P><A NAME="conclusion"><IMG ALT="Conclusion"
					SRC="../images/conclusion.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0></A></P>
			
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry is a national leader
			in the fight against mental illness. Its innovative research
			has opened up new pathways to better cures and treatments;
			its effective clinical care has made a dramatic difference
			in the lives of the mentally ill and their families and
			friends and its dissemination of knowledge has helped mental
			health professionals improve treatment for people who suffer
			from mental illness.</P>
			
			<P>After thirty years of development, The Clarke's ability
			to improve the quality of life for people who suffer from
			mental illness and for the community-at-large is
			unparalleled.</P>
			
			<P>However, The Clarke's potential goes far beyond its
			ability, which is based largely on government funding. It is
			up to the wider community -- families, friends, businesses,
			charitable foundations -- to realize this potential through
			financial and public support of The Clarke's leadership in
			the field of mental health.</P>

			<P>Established 30 years ago, The Clarke Institute of
			Psychiatry (The Clarke) conducts research into psychiatric
			illness, trains mental health professionals, and cares for
			people suffering from mental health problems. From the
			beginning we have enjoyed a unique academic relationship
			with the Department of Psychiatry at the University of
			Toronto and have fulfilled both a provincial and local role
			in providing care and training. Over the years, tens of
			thousands of patients and their families have received
			excellent care, while several generations of mental health
			professionals have been trained at The Clarke. This year we
			will provide assessment and treatment to more people than
			ever before and will participate in the training of over 330
			students in the mental health disciplines.</P>
			
			<P>As for research, the contributions of The Clarke
			researchers to our understanding and treatment of
			psychiatric disorders has been recognized around the world.
			Over the past five years the amount of research money
			awarded to The Clarke researchers has quadrupled -- a
			remarkable accomplishment at a time of intense competition
			for shrinking research dollars. This funding will enable The
			Clarke to continue to play a key role in understanding how
			mental illnesses develop and how to treat them cost
			effectively.</P>
			
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry is a unique
			organization with a distinguished history. We intend to
			maintain our high standards of care, research and education,
			and to work with others. Our goals are to lead in the battle
			against mental illness, and to improve the quality of life
			of those we treat and serve.</P>

			race a yacht; be a champion tennis player; play the violin
			with a group of professional musicians; teach psychiatry in
			a faculty of medicine; superintend a large hospital; write
			numerous articles for professional journals, and still have
			enough time to harass busy politicians in order to provide
			better care for the mentally ill?&quot;</I></P>

			<P>M.B.Dymond, Minister of Health, about Dr. C.K. Clarke, in
			his opening address at The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in
			1966.</P>
						
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, located in Toronto at
			250 College Street and opened in 1966, was named in honour
			of Dr. Charles Kirk Clarke. C.K Clarke, often considered the
			father of Canadian psychiatry, practiced psychiatry in the
			late 1800's and early 1900's in Ontario - a time when almost
			all psychiatric patients were kept in asylums operated by
			the government. Operation of the institutions for the insane
			was frequently affected by political changes.</P>
			
			<P>In 1880, following his training in Toronto, Clarke went
			to the Hamilton Hospital for the insane as Assistant
			Superintendent and, late in 1881, was transferred to the
			Rockwood Asylum in Kingston where he joined his
			brother-in-law, Dr. William Metcalf, who was the
			Superintendent. Together they formed the medical staff.</P>
			
			<P>In early 1885, despite his many administrative and
			clinical innovations in partnership with Dr. Metcalf, Clarke
			had decided to quit because, in his words, &quot;I love
			psychiatry but hate politics.&quot; The day after Clarke's
			resignation was in the hands of the government (August
			13,1885), he and Metcalf were making ward rounds when a
			patient rushed them and stabbed Metcalf fatally.</P>
			
			<P>At the request of the government, Clarke withdrew his
			resignation and became Superintendent at Kingston &quot;in
			order to protect several hundred defenseless creatures from
			a political hireling who might be pitch-forked into the
			position.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Two of Clarke's earliest measures to improve the
			patients' conditions were the establishment of non-restraint
			and of practical forms of occupational therapy. He set up
			shops for various industries, chiefly brush and broom
			making, where many patients were employed. Soon Kingston was
			supplying the other asylums and selling brooms and brushes
			on the open market. Business and labour complained that this
			was unfair competition; the politicians heard the complaints
			and instructions went from the Superintendent of Asylums to
			Clarke to curtail his mischievous activity. Clarke's
			eventual response was to set up other diversional activities
			including drama clubs and an orchestra.</P>
			
			<P>In 1887, Clarke began the first course in Canada
			providing formal training for nurses and attendants caring
			for the mentally ill. In 1895, he became the first professor
			of mental diseases at Queen's University, Kingston. In 1905,
			he was appointed Superintendent of the Toronto Asylum.</P>
			
			<P>In 1907, he was appointed to a Royal Commission
			established by the Provincial Government to visit major
			mental clinics in Europe. The Commission was so impressed
			with Dr. Kraepelin's Clinic in Munich that it recommended
			establishing a similar clinic in Toronto. In 1908, the
			Government announced its intention to do so at a cost of
			$500,000. However, this clinic was never built because, in
			Clarke's view, of the &quot;jealousy and malicious
			tactics&quot; of his colleagues in the mental hospitals.</P>
			
			<P>Clarke became the first professor of psychiatry at the
			University of Toronto in 1906 and Dean of the Faculty of
			Medicine in 1908 - the same year in which he became Medical
			Superintendent at the newly established Toronto General
			Hospital.</P>
			
			<P>He established the first out-patient psychiatric clinic
			in Canada in a small house which was part of the Toronto
			General Hospital at the time. Dr. Ernest Jones, later a
			colleague of Freud's and his biographer, was the outpatient
			clinic's first Medical Director.</P>
			
			<P>Clarke continued to work for his objective of a
			Psychiatric Clinic which would combine exemplary care with
			research and education.<P>
			
			<P>Writing in 1915, he stated:</P>
			
			<P><I>&quot;...such a Hospital...must be kept
			absolutely free from political control...the ideal
			arrangement would be to have it under the supervision of a
			dignified Board of Trustees of the same class as those to be
			found in the General Hospitals; men who are superior to the
			temptation of political exigency...&quot;</I></P>
			
			<P>During World War I, Dr. Clarke had to assume additional
			administrative responsibilities. As Dean he had the
			unenviable job of persuading the various hospitals to
			improve their clinical facilities in order to provide
			adequate instruction for medical students. Doing this in
			wartime, with the inevitable shortages of staff and
			equipment, must have been enormously difficult. These,
			however, were only part of Dr. Clarke's concerns. He also
			had the responsibility, in March 1995, for organizing the
			University's No. 4 Overseas Hospital consisting of 1040
			beds.</P>
			
			<P>The end of hostilities found Dr. Clarke still deeply
			involved in the complicated problems of running Toronto
			General Hospital and initiating a 6-year curriculum for
			medical students at the University of Toronto. All this was
			in addition to his work as Director of the Mental Deficiency
			Clinic, Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the
			Psychological Laboratory.</P>
			
			<P>At the height of his career, a seemingly insignificant
			meeting altered the course of Dr. Clarke's life. It also
			opened a new era in the history of the treatment of the
			mentally ill in Canada. This meeting was held in the Toronto
			home of Mrs. D A. Dunlop on 26 February 1918. The main
			speaker of the evening was a visitor from the United States,
			Clifford Beers, author of &quot;A Mind That Found
			Itself.&quot; Two months later, the Canadian National
			Committee for Mental Hygiene, now the Canadian Mental Health
			Association, was formed with Dr. C.K. Clarke as Medical
			Director.</P>
			
			<P>In 1918, pressure of work compelled Dr. Clarke to
			relinquish his position as Superintendent of the Toronto
			General Hospital. However, his position as Dean of the
			Faculty of Medicine continued to be as demanding as ever. He
			resigned his appointment as Dean of Medicine in 1920,
			intending to devote himself entirely to the leadership of
			the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. To celebrate his
			50 years of service to psychiatry, the 66-year-old Dr.
			Clarke was honoured in 1923 with an invitation from the
			Royal Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain and
			Ireland to deliver the Fourth Annual Maudsley Lecture. In
			Toronto, a distinguished Committee was formed to celebrate
			Dr. Clarke's Golden Jubilee. His portrait, which now hangs
			in The Clarke Institute, was painted by Curtis Williamson
			for this occasion but, before it could be presented to him,
			&quot;C.K. became ill and died on 20 January 1924.</P>

			<TD><P>Toronto Psychiatric Hospital possessed only 72 beds and
			its small building was inadequate to support the facilities
			envisaged by Dr. Stokes. For much of his tenure in Toronto,
			he struggled to remedy this. He brought together influential
			people from university and business interests, and by
			allying these with the provincial government, he set in
			motion those forces which ultimately resulted in the opening
			of The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in 1966.</P>
			
			<P>In the forty years between the opening of the Toronto
			Psychiatric Hospital and the opening of The Clarke on July
			1, 1966, three events occurred that helped The Clarke become
			a reality.</P>
			
			<P>First, in 1923, the government of Ontario was bequeathed
			a sum of money from the Patterson estate to be directed to
			research in the field of mental diseases. The government, at
			least partly in deference to the family's concern about
			being associated with mental disease, did nothing with this
			money other than to turn it over to the Treasury for
			management. In the mid 1950's, Dr. Stokes became aware of
			the money from the Patterson estate, which had grown to
			about $250,000. He encouraged the government to make it
			available for the purpose for which it was intended.</P>
			
			<P>In 1961, Dr. Matthew Dymond, Minister of Health, who was
			actively interested in the field of mental health and who
			wanted to see an Institute independent of the Ontario mental
			hospital system, established the Ontario Mental Health
			Foundation with Mr. Justice Arthur Kelly as its first
			chairman.</P>
			
			<P>Among its many objectives, the Foundation was to
			establish a hospital or hospitals for the diagnosis and
			treatment of mental disorders and for research and
			education. Almost immediately, Mr. Justice Kelly and Dr.
			Stokes began work on the founding of an Ontario psychiatric
			institute. In 1964, their work came to fruition with the
			creation of The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, through the
			addition of Part 2 to the Ontario Mental Health Foundation
			Act. The Clarke actually opened on July 1, 1966.</P>

			<TD><P>The Clarke's Schizophrenia Division was established
			in 1995 to serve as a regional, provincial and national
			Centre of Excellence for the study and treatment of
			schizophrenia.  The Division is committed to specialized
			research and education, as well as the provision of clinical
			care and services.</P>
			
			<P>The Division's research mission is to advance the
			understanding of the causes of schizophrenia and to develop
			treatments which will optimize outcome. Individuals
			receiving care in this division are offered the opportunity
			to participate in research studies. The research efforts of
			the Schizophrenia Division have also been greatly enhanced
			by strong collaborative efforts with our Positron Emission
			Tomography (PET) Centre. The effective collaboration of the
			PET team and the Schizophrenia Division promises to yield
			important insights into the brain abnormalities which
			underlie schizophrenia, as well as generate new approaches
			to pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia.</P>
			
			<P>In addition to supporting graduate and postgraduate
			training of health professionals, the Division is committed
			to community outreach and public education. We welcome
			invitations to speak with interested community and/or
			hospital-based programs about issues related to
			schizophrenia.</P>
			
			<P>The Division has also developed new clinical services
			available on referral from physicians, community agencies,
			families, and individuals with schizophrenia. These programs
			and how to access them are described in <A
			HREF="../about_services/schizophrenia_division.html">About
			The Clarke's Services: Schizophrenia Division</A>.</P>

			<P><B><A NAME="Battle"><IMG ALT="Leadership in the Battle Against Mental Illness"
			SRC="../images/annual_report_battle.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26></A></B></P>
				<P>"Leadership in the battle against mental illness" -- our
				new mission statement. Anyone who has ever been on a
				committee developing something like a mission statement will
				know those seven words were not arrived at readily. There
				were debates, alternatives, suggested rewordings. Some said
				"leadership" was too ambitious, too presumptuous. Some said
				"battle" was the wrong term -- politically incorrect, too
				militaristic. But, in the end, the mission stood.</P>
				
				<P>It is hard to know how far to go with the metaphor, as
				the word "battle" conjures up powerful and painful images...
				opposing forces, weapons, troops, strategies, victors,
				casualties... and memorials. Unfortunately, mental illness
				involves all of those. To us it also signifies hope, help
				and healing for people with mental illnesses.</P>
				
				<P>Our adversaries are the powerful disorders of the mind --
				schizophrenia, manic-depression, depression, antisocial
				personality, many others. But psychiatry as a discipline is
				still young. Many of the treatments we use to fight mental
				illnesses are still in the developmental stages --
				psychotherapy, medications, rehabilitation, education. Most
				of what we now know in psychiatry we have learned since I
				graduated from medical school. I feel both humble and proud
				to tell you that a part of that knowledge has emanated from
				The Clarke.</P>
				
				<P>Engaged in the struggle are the caregivers, researchers,
				fundraisers, families, counselors, self-help groups -- all
				those who lend their skill and care to the campaign. This
				report tells of some of their work together, within the
				Institute and in the community. Strategies are many --
				collaborative research, innovative projects, new therapies,
				patient and public education -- you will read about some of
				them in this report.</P>
				
				<P>The enormity of the battle is reflected in the numbers.
				The one in one hundred who have schizophrenia. The one in
				ten who have depression. The ten in a hundred who have
				obsessions or fears or anxieties that rule their lives.
				These are the people who are truly on the battlefield every
				moment of every day. For many, with the help of families,
				caregivers and therapies, the struggle is waged and won. Too
				many are still casualties -- the suicides, the lost
				potential, the failed careers, the broken families. Like a
				war zone, sometimes you see them, lying on the streets of
				Toronto.</P>
				
				<P>These lives are the reason The Clarke is dedicated to the
				other part of the mission -- "leadership." At times, The
				Clarke has been accused of too little leadership, too little
				sharing. But leadership to us means working through, and
				working with, all of those who are devoted to improving our
				understanding of mental illness. It means listening to those
				who suffer and to their families, and including them in our
				work.</P>
				
				<P>On the occasion of our anniversary, we look back to our
				origins. Although the Institute is only 30 years old, its
				founders go back to the turn of this century, founders who
				believed mental illnesses were illnesses, when everyone
				thought they were demons. If they had not been bold enough
				to lead, we might still be casting out devils. When we feel
				our progress is slow, we need only to look at the wretched
				conditions of less than a century ago to know what a
				challenge they assumed. And what a victory is being won. The
				anniversary renewal of our mission is a tribute to all of
				those who are part of our heritage.</P>
				
				<P>There are other opponents in the battle -- ignorance,
				fear and their ally, stigma. This can be your mission -- to
				understand mental illnesses; to recognize the war, not the
				personal weakness; to trade derision for compassion; to help
				advance the campaign. The mission still stands.</P>
				
				<P>I invite you to join us.</P>

			<P><B><A NAME="30_Years_On"><IMG ALT="30 Years On: An Overview"
			SRC="../images/annual_report_30_years.gif" WIDTH=302 HEIGHT=26></A></B></P>
				<P>At times over the past year, it seemed like our battle
				was not against mental illnesses, but was more a struggle to
				balance competing yet equally important priorities and to
				maintain levels of care, education and research with
				dwindling resources. At The Clarke, the pressure to maximize
				our financial and human resources, and yet improve quality
				and activity, engendered a number of initiatives.</P>
				
				<P>Some of them are briefly outlined below:</P>
				
				<P>The Hospital Restructuring Report of the Metro Toronto
				District Health Council reaffirmed The Clarke's mandate as
				an independent specialty mental health facility and its role
				as a provincial leader in psychiatric research, education,
				diagnosis and treatment. The Report recommended closer
				collaboration in psychiatry among the downtown teaching
				hospitals and this Annual Report outlines some areas where
				this is expanding. The Restructuring Report also recognized
				mental health care as a priority and emphasized augmentation
				of community-based mental health services to reduce use of
				psychiatric beds in general and specialty hospitals. The
				Clarke's response to the Hospital Restructuring Committee's
				Report stressed the need to protect the existing psychiatry
				beds, urging that without significant community input,
				further reductions would stress an already
				stretched-to-the-limit mental health system.</P>
				
				<P>The Strategic Planning Advisory Task Force, in
				consultation with Senior Management and staff, developed a
				plan to guide the Institute through the next five years. The
				Task Force members represented Board members, consumers,
				family members, community representatives and all levels of
				Clarke staff. The Task Force analysed our external and
				internal environments, and defined more explicitly our "core
				businesses." Invited presentations from government and
				community leaders gave insight into community expectations.
				The Task Force developed a new Mission Statement, which more
				clearly describes our purpose and vision; it is reprinted on
				the front of this report. Key directions for the Institute
				to the year 2000 are to maintain our focus on major mental
				disorders; increase emphasis on the integration of clinical
				care, research and education; preserve our commitment to
				basic research as the hope for the future; stress transfer
				of knowledge from research to practice; and expand
				partnerships with organizations who share our goals. New
				work in this direction is described in later pages.</P>
				
				<P>The Institute's 1995-96 Operating Plan was approved by
				the Ministry of Health and received a positive review for
				balancing the budget with minimal effect on service delivery
				and staff. Our Work Group on Diversity conducted an
				extensive survey of staff experiences of prejudice or
				discrimination in the workplace, with encouraging results.
				Nine out of ten respondents agreed that "regarding diversity
				issues, The Clarke is a good place for staff, students and
				volunteers." However, several areas for improvement were
				identified; these concerns are shared and are being
				supported with appropriate initiatives. As part of this
				thrust, diversity awareness training was held for management
				staff and new employment policies on diversity were
				adopted.</P>
				
				<P>Effective April 1995, Ms. Jean Simpson was appointed
				Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer,
				sharing the senior administrative duties of The Clarke with
				Dr. Paul Garfinkel. Dr. David Goldbloom succeeded Dr.
				Richard Swinson as Vice President Medical Affairs and Chief
				of Staff. Dr. Swinson continues as Head of the Anxiety
				Disorders Clinic.</P>
				
				<P>Dr. Gregory Brown retired as Vice President Research, but
				continues as Head of the Neuroendocrinology Research
				Section. Dr. Brown also became our Corporate Liaison
				Officer, to develop partnerships with industry in support of
				psychiatric research. Dr. Franco Vaccarino was appointed
				Vice President Research. Dr Vaccarino is Professor of
				Psychology and Psychiatry at University of Toronto, Senior
				Research Consultant in the Mood and Anxiety Division and an
				internationally-recognized researcher in the behavioural
				action of neuropeptides.</P>
				
				<P>Ms. Beverley Abosh completed her term as Vice President
				of Professional Services this year and was succeeded by Ms.
				Elizabeth Scott. Ms. Scott combines her new role with her
				position as Head of Occupational Therapy. Her training and
				interests are in epidemiology and quality-of-life research
				with persons with serious mental illness. Ms. Abosh
				continues as Head of Social Work and is developing a Family
				Institute which will promote excellence in work with
				troubled families and families of persons with mental
				illness. The Institute will provide consultation and
				training on the impact of mental illness on families and
				evaluation of family interventions.</P>
				
				<P>Consistent with our emphasis on continuing evaluation at
				all levels, program reviews were undertaken in three of our
				clinical Divisions. A program review of the Continuing Care
				Division recommended that this highly-rated model be
				extended to community sectors with a mandate for long-term
				community care. The Clarke, as a tertiary referral centre,
				will focus its resources on the provision of short-term
				multidisciplinary care to patients at all stages of
				schizophrenia, ranging from young adults experiencing their
				first episode of schizophrenia to persistently ill patients
				whose illness has been resistant to current therapies. The
				services of the reorganized Schizophrenia Division, with Dr.
				Robert Zipursky as new Head, are described in more detail in
				this report.</P>
				
				<P>The program review of our two child psychiatry Divisions
				-- Family Court Clinic and Child and Family Studies --
				recommended an integration of these Divisions' programs and
				services, offering a shared range of services to combine
				strengths and increase collaboration. More linkages with our
				adult Divisions were suggested, to increase continuity of
				care across age groups. The review recommended that our
				child psychiatry expertise could best be utilized in more
				extensive consultative and backup services to front line
				professionals, again reiterating the tertiary care
				mandate.</P>
				
				<P>An external review of the potential benefits or
				disadvantages of sharing administrative services between The
				Clarke and neighbouring Addiction Research Foundation found
				that we are providing administrative services in a highly
				effective and efficient manner and that potential cost
				savings are minimal unless major consolidations are
				undertaken. Possible actions are being carefully reviewed in
				light of impact on staff and facilities and the costs that
				may be necessary for the two organizations to work more
				closely together. In the same vein, we streamlined by
				closing our Cafeteria and revamping our ground floor Coffee
				Shop, producing a more pleasant, accessible and
				cost-effective dining area for patients, staff, and
				visitors. We opened a new and welcoming information desk to
				direct patients and visitors to our many services.</P>
				
				<P>Staff involvement and communication were heightened with
				the weekly publication of a newsletter to keep staff
				up-to-date. Open interchange is facilitated with informal
				monthly "Let's Get Acquainted" coffee sessions between the
				President and line staff and a confidential voicemail box
				direct to the President and Executive Vice President. Our
				Board undertook a series of regular tours of the facility,
				giving an opportunity for dialogue between Board and
				frontline staff. A market research survey was undertaken to
				measure knowledge of, and satisfaction with, Clarke programs
				and directions. Results indicated a good level of awareness
				of The Clarke mission and satisfaction with our services,
				and numerous constructive suggestions for future
				improvements.</P>
				
				<P>We are grateful to our funders, particularly the Ministry
				of Health, and to the charitable, corporate and individual
				partners who generously support our work. We appreciate the
				wisdom and direction of Board members who truly share the
				Institute's sense of purpose. We are, as always, indebted to
				our accomplished staff; they are a formidable force. And
				most of all we thank our patients, clients, consumers and
				their families who, by trusting us enough to share their
				struggle, thereby grant us a singular privilege.</P>

				<P><B>Notes to Statement of Revenues, Expenses<BR>
				and Operating Fund Balance</B></P>
				
				<P>1. Purpose</P>
				
				<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry [the Institute] was incorporated
				in 1965 under Bill 161, Part II, An Act to Amend The Ontario Mental 
				Health Foundation Act. The objects of the Institute are to maintain, 
				manage and operate a hospital with facilities for psychiatric research, 
				education, diagnosis and treatment.</P>
				
				<P>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</P>
				
				<P>These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
				significant accounting policies summarized as follows:</P>

			<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../images/bullet.gif"
					ALIGN=TOP WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=5 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 ALT="*">
				<TD><P>Basis of accounting: The Institute follows the accrual
				method of accounting whereby revenue is recorded when earned
				and expenses are recorded when incurred.</P>
					
			<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../images/bullet.gif"
					ALIGN=TOP WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=5 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 ALT="*">
				<TD><P>Short-term investments: Short-term investments are

				realizable value.</P>
					
			<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../images/bullet.gif"
					ALIGN=TOP WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=5 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 ALT="*">
				<TD><P>Capital assets: Capital assets and amortization are
				accounted for in the Capital Fund. Capital assets are
				recorded at cost and amortized on the straight-line basis
				over their estimated useful lives at the following annual
				rates: Equipment 5% to 20%</P>

			<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../images/bullet.gif"
					ALIGN=TOP WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=5 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 ALT="*">
				<TD><P>Contributions: Contributions to Special Purpose Funds
				are recognized when payment is received, except for External
				Research Grants which includes amounts received and

				<P><B>Auditors' Report</B></P>
				
				<P>To the Board of Trustees of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry
				and the Provincial Auditor</P>
				
				<P>Pursuant to the Ontario Mental Health Foundation Act which provides
				that the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, an agency of the Crown, shall 
				be audited by the Provincial Auditor or an auditor appointed by the
				Lieutenant Governor in Council, we have audited the balance sheet of
				the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry as at March 31, 1996 and the 
				statements of revenue, expenses and operating fund balance, capital 
				fund balance, special purpose funds balances and changes in financial 
				position for the year then ended. These financial statements are
				the responsibility of the Institute's management. Our responsibility
				is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
				We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
				standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit
				to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are
				free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test 
				basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
				statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
				used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
				evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
				In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all material 
				respects, the financial position of the Institute as at March 31, 1996 and 
				the results of its operations and the changes in its financial position for
				the year then ended in accordance with generally accepted accounting
				principles.</P>

			<P><B>Clarke Institute of Psychiatry Implements
			Computer-based Treatment for Stuttering</B></P>
			
			<P>&quot;Dr. Fluency, a ground-breaking new computer program
			being tested by the Speech Pathology Department at The
			Clarke, vastly improves treatment for stuttering,&quot; says
			Dr. Robert Kroll, Head of Speech Pathology and Assistant
			Professor of Speech Pathology and Psychiatry, U of T. The
			advent of computer treatment for stuttering has an
			interesting history.</P>
			
			<P>Ten years ago Dr. Kroll trained Israeli clinicians in the
			therapy program offered by The Clarke. One of the clients
			who took the program, Ari Friedman, was a computer expert
			and later developed this computer program for patients to
			practice at home. After the Israeli government provided
			funding to test the program worldwide, The Clarke was
			designated as a testing site.</P>
			
			<P>A powerful computer with CD ROM is needed to run the
			program, so David Caron, VP, Information Processing Services
			for Bell Sygma has loaned two computers to run the program.
			Mr. Caron is a strong proponent of the program and was
			himself a client of Speech Pathology over 20 years ago.</P>
			
			<P>Speech therapy for stuttering entails a series of speech
			exercises designed to facilitate fluency. Clients learn to
			monitor and control voice speed, vocal cord use and tooth
			and lip pressure. Previously, clients would produce sounds
			and then a therapist would provide personal feedback on
			their exercises. With the new program, the computer listens
			to and analyses speech and then gives feedback to the
			client. In addition to aural feedback, the program provides
			visual feedback through graphics on the computer monitor
			which reinforce the correct position of the tongue and teeth
			when pronouncing various sounds.</P>
			
			<P>An intensive 3 week training program with the computer is
			offered from 9:30 am - 3:30 pm five days a week. This allows
			clients to use Dr. Fluency on an individual and group basis
			and provides feedback to staff, allowing them to examine
			both the initial program and feedback to develop an improved
			treatment program.</P>
			
			<P>Bryan Lipka, a 22-year-old credit agency worker has
			struggled with stuttering since he was a toddler. He came to
			The Clarke program this year to improve his speech and was
			lucky enough to be assigned to test the new Dr. Fluency.
			Bryan says that the computer program, &quot;makes it
			(therapy) more interesting, more accurate and facilitates
			additional home practice.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>&quot;We hope this program will help more people more
			effectively. Often it's difficult for someone to recall
			exercises when they are at home but this program is
			motivating - it aims to increase practice and fluency.
			Treatment, like any other skill, is only effective with
			long-term follow-up and practice,&quot; says Dr.
			Kroll.					</P>

			<P><B>Clarke Child &amp; Family Studies Program Sharpens
			Psychiatric Skills of Pediatricians</B></P>
			
			<P>Because a significant number of visits to pediatricians
			are due to emotional and/or behavioural problems in
			children, Dr. Tatyana Barankin and a team from The Clarke
			Child and Family Studies Centre will be offering a new
			continuing education series to strengthen pediatricians'
			skills in child psychiatry. Dr. Barankin was trained both in
			pediatrics and child psychiatry. She runs the Risk Clinic at
			The Clarke and is an Assistant Professor, Department of
			Psychiatry, U of T.</P>
			
			<P>&quot;There is a real paucity of information in this
			field. On average, only 2-4 child psychiatrists are
			graduating each year in Toronto. Pediatricians and GP's are
			filling this gap, but require additional training. We need
			to educate doctors about all the child psychiatry resources
			available; when to refer and how to use these
			resources.&quot; says Dr. Barankin</P>
			
			<P>Wanting to share The Clarke's expertise, Dr. Barankin
			envisioned a series of 8-10 training sessions, each 2 hours
			in length, which would help train community pediatricians in
			child psychiatry. The training sessions will involve a
			combination of lectures and presentation of case studies and
			participants will be encouraged to use examples from their
			own practice.</P>
			
			<P>Dr. Barankin hopes the program will help pediatricians
			learn to communicate with a child and family more
			effectively and learn there are no simple tests in
			psychiatry, but there are helpful screening instruments.
			This will help simplify the diagnostic procedure.
			Pediatricians will be exposed to a variety of pragmatic
			short-term treatment techniques that could be utilized in a
			community pediatrician's office.</P>
			
			<P>Dr. Barankin says, &quot;Child psychiatry is more complex
			than adult therapy. Often the way you approach a situation
			or phrase a question makes all the difference. If a doctor
			asks, 'You haven't been sexually abused, have you?' the
			child will be inclined to answer &quot;no.&quot; But that
			may not be the truth. A child who is brought in by their
			parent may not want to talk about their feelings immediately
			with a doctor. A slower, more sophisticated approach is
			needed.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Assessment and treatment of psychiatric illness will be
			covered in the course and topics will include: interviewing
			techniques, approaches to treatment, depression and anxiety
			disorder in childhood, disruptive behavioural disorder,
			pediatric psychopharmacology, family issues (divorce, death
			etc.) and adolescent problems. The planning team consists of
			Drs. T. Barankin, J. Beitchman, D. Schacter, U. Jain, B.
			Ferguson and A. Saksznajder.</P>
			
			<P>Sessions will be open to community pediatricians in the
			greater Toronto area with a maximum of 20-30 doctors
			participating per session.</P>
			
			<P>Dr. Barankin initiated the program after discussions with
			Dr. Bob Issenman, Head of the OMA Section of Pediatrics,
			when she became aware that pediatricians in the community
			needed greater access to psychiatric resources and as well
			had some deficits in their training in this area.</P>
			
			<P>Pediatricians from the Greater Toronto Area were then
			polled regarding child psychiatry topics where they felt a
			need for more intensive training. Feedback on the planning
			process for these sessions was also provided by a community
			pediatrician. In addition, participants will be asked at a
			later point to evaluate the impact of this training on their
			practice patterns and knowledge gain.</P>
			
			<P>Pediatricians interested in participating in the sessions
			may contact the Education Office at 979-6852 or Dr. Barankin
			at 979-4747, X-2254. Sessions will commence in January and
			will run once a week for two hours. The full training
			process involves 8-10 sessions which are recognized as CME
			credits by the University of Toronto.</P>

			<P><B>Clarke Institute Program Helps Children with Learning
			Disabilities and Anxiety</B></P>
			
			<P>A new program at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry,
			Children's Anxiety, Learning and Memory study (CALM), is
			studying the separate and combined effects of anxiety and
			learning disability in children. Childhood anxiety disorders
			and learning disabilities have separately been shown to
			place a child at increased risk for academic, work, social
			and emotional difficulties. This unique study, under the
			direction of psychologist, Dr. Arlene Young, examines the
			effect of anxiety on learning in both learning disabled and
			nondisabled children. 6-8% of all children have learning
			disabilities and they are often first identified in
			childhood.</P>
			
			<P>Parents, teachers and researchers have long noticed an
			association between learning disabilities and anxiety.
			Literature also shows that these children are at risk for
			becoming depressed. Yet, very little research has focused
			specifically on these combined difficulties. Are there
			factors predicting anxiety disorders among learning disabled
			children? What effect does anxiety have on a child's ability
			to learn? Staff at the Clarke Institute's Neuropsychiatry
			Clinic plan to answer these and other questions.</P>
			
			<P>According to Dr. Young, &quot;This study will help us
			understand how two areas of difficulty known to put children
			at increased risk for social or emotional difficulties
			interrelate. We know that worries and anxiety take up
			resources that are needed for learning and remembering new
			information in adults. Much less is known about children and
			very little is known about the effects of anxiety on
			children who are already struggling academically. As a
			result of repeated failure, children often develop school
			avoidance, poor self-esteem and a feeling of &quot;loss of
			control&quot; over events in their lives.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Children suffering from anxiety and learning disabilities
			may also exhibit social withdrawal, be &quot;worriers&quot;,
			have difficulty dealing with change, or have somatic
			complaints (headaches, stomachaches etc.). Often the anxiety
			component is missed in children with poor language skills
			because they are quiet and tend to &quot;suffer in
			silence.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>The CALM program begins with a team assessment of the
			family by a psychiatrist, psychologist and social worker. It
			is important to get a clear picture of problems/issues and
			an understanding of the child's strengths and weaknesses as
			well as the situation they live in. The children then
			participate in psychological tests and a semistructured
			interview related to anxiety disorders. During this process,
			possible coexisting conditions such as, Attention Deficit
			Hyperactivity Disorder and oppositional behaviour are ruled
			identified.</P>
			
			<P>The Children's Anxiety, Learning and Memory study (CALM)
			is suitable for children 8-12 years old who have anxiety
			disorders, learning disorders or both. Children may be
			referred by parents, teachers, physicians or community
			workers.</P>
			
			<P>The assessment entails cognitive testing and academic
			testing as well as experimental tasks measuring memory,
			learning and attention. Children's interpretation of events
			and the strategies they use to cope with difficulties are
			also measured. Many children with LD and anxiety invert a
			normal view and attribute their success or failure at tasks
			to luck versus skill, thus contributing to poor
			self-esteem.</P>
			
			<P>After completing the assessment results are shared with
			the parents, and with their consent, the school. The program
			hopes to learn what these children do well and what they
			have difficulty with, and then develop a specific treatment
			program to fit this.</P>
			
			<P>Eventually, the team intends to run support groups for
			parents, providing information on learning disabilities and
			anxiety and how they work. This will help the parents change
			how they interact and communicate better with their
			children.</P>
			
			<P>Eighty children will be seen in the first year of the

			<P>Team members hope the results of this study will help
			Boards of Education reshape current programs, helping to
			identify and assist children with these difficulties earlier

			<P><B>Helping Children Cope with Anger and
			Aggression</B></P>
			
			<P>A new group treatment program at The Clarke Institute of
			Psychiatry helps children aged 8-12 cope with anger and
			aggression. The 10 week program, developed by Dr. Meagan
			Smith, Psychologist and Isabel Granic, Research Assistant,
			aims to teach children how to manage and express anger in
			non-aggressive, socially acceptable ways.</P>
			
			<P>Groups will meet once a week for 10 weeks; a session
			began in September/October 1996, and another will begin in
			January and February, 1997. Children will be placed in
			either a Cognitive Behavioural or a Social Interaction
			group.</P>
			
			<P>The Cognitive Behavioural Group melds components of
			relaxation techniques, reattribution training, enhanced
			problem solving and social skills and a psychoeducational
			element aimed at demystifying violence and aggression in the
			media. The Social Interaction Group will enhance children's
			social and interpersonal skills such as cooperation and
			effective communication through recreational activities in a
			supervised, structured setting. These two approaches will be
			compared to identify the most effective means of decreasing
			the intensity and duration of anger in children and reduce
			the incidence of aggressive behaviour.</P>
			
			<P>Children with persistent, disruptive anger and aggression
			difficulties may fight, destroy property, throw temper
			tantrums, frequently argue and/or swear, behave cruelly,
			blame others for their mistakes and manipulate
			others.Without treatment, maladaptive behaviours will
			continue, and often lead to low self-esteem, poor school
			performance and interpersonal conflicts. Children may
			eventually turn to verbal and physical assaults on
			others.</P>
			
			<P>&quot;This program is unique because it specifically
			focuses on anger and aggression in children and tries to
			integrate a variety of components to help them. Clinicians
			and researchers have not had a lot of success - long-term
			effects - with this problem. We hope this program will help
			kids cope with and control their anger, to avoid
			difficulties later in life.&quot; Dr. Meagan Smith,
			Psychologist</P>
			
			<P>A treatment manual has been developed to allow other
			professionals to conduct the program offsite in the
			community, and staff intend to develop a parent component to
			add to the manual at a later stage. The Clarke program is
			staffed by trained group leaders and supervised students and
			volunteers from various disciplines including social work,
			psychology and occupational therapy. A new brochure
			describing the program is available from Isabel Granic at
			979-4747, ext. 2425.</P>
			
			<P>There is no cost for the program and children may be
			referred by family members, teachers, or mental health
			professionals. Children and their parents and teachers will
			be asked to complete questionnaires before and after the
			program, so that treatment effects can be evaluated. Six
			months after completion, children may attend a
			&quot;booster&quot; session, allowing them to review what
			they have learned and to share any difficulties they may be
			experiencing.</P>

			<P><B>Clarke Institute Community Nursing Program Offers
			In-Home Crisis Care</B></P>
			
			<P>An innovative Community Nursing Program at The Clarke
			Institute provides psychiatric nursing for the acutely
			mentally ill, acting as an alternative to hospitalization
			and allowing people to remain in their home.</P>
			
			<P>Psychiatric nurses working in close consultation with
			physicians and other appropriate professionals, provide
			time-limited, in-home support to patients who are
			experiencing a short-term psychiatric crisis.  Eligible
			participants can be referred by any professional (nurse,
			social worker, doctor), must be under the care of a
			physician at The Clarke and must voluntarily agree to
			participate in the program.  The average period of support
			is 21 visits.</P>
			
			<P>Deborah, a client of the Community Nursing Program, has
			suffered with manic depressive illness for nearly 20 years. 
			Originally enrolled in University, she was unable to
			complete her studies, in part due to her illness. 
			Difficulty in diagnosing her illness prolonged impaired
			functioning with both work and family life.  Because of the
			nature of manic depression (it is cyclical), clients may be
			in the program more than once.  The first time Deborah
			received home visits was 14 months ago; this time it will be
			for nine visits.</P>
			
			<P>Visits occur on a flexible schedule, beginning with up to
			seven days a week and decreasing over time.  They can range
			from one and a half hours to a half-day in length, depending
			on the client's needs.  Janice Harris, a nurse with the
			program who visits Deborah, has six clients at present. 
			Some she sees twice a week, others daily.</P>
			
			<P>Janice assists Deborah with a variety of tasks during a
			visit ranging from medication issues, registering for
			university, talking about relationship problems, nutrition
			counseling or even shopping.  Deborah feels comfortable
			discussing both physical as well as emotional problems with
			Janice and Janice has also helped Deborah get into various
			community programs.  Deborah is now continuing her education
			at York University.</P>
			
			<P>Advantages of the program are that clients feel more
			comfortable at home, have a longer time commitment of
			follow-up and receive assistance with medication and other
			issues.  Deborah says, &quot;There is a real difference in
			care.  A more personal relationship offers support and
			consistency  and clients have more control.&quot;  Janice
			says, &quot;You develop a more holistic view of the whole
			person rather than focusing on the illness.  I am amazed at
			how much more I know about my clients -- how many strengths
			they have.  You pick up on things you see rather than solely
			relying on what they say.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Because of the stigma surrounding mental illness,
			families find it easier to stay close and feel more
			comfortable with this program than visiting clients in
			hospital.  Most family members feel the program has a
			positive impact on their relatives and they are able to ask
			questions more readily.</P>
			
			<P>To date, results indicate positive clinical outcomes for
			many patients, reduced subsequent hospital stays, and high
			levels of consumer and nursing satisfaction.  Vice-President
			of Nursing, Nancy Johnston, says this initiative provides an
			expanded role for psychiatric nurses as highly-skilled
			professionals, and believes the program could well form the
			basis for a model for consumers and health care providers in
			the 90's.</P>

			<P><B>Clarke Bridging Psychiatry &amp; Alternative
			Medicine</B></P>
			
			<P>A two-day symposium beginning on November 1, 1996 -
			Psychiatry &amp; Alternative Medicine: Building Bridges -
			will explore alternative approaches ranging from Chinese
			herbs to Shamanism for treating acute and chronic mental
			illnesses. Sponsored jointly by The Clarke Institute of
			Psychiatry and the Department of Psychiatry at the
			University of Toronto, the goal of the symposium is to
			introduce alternative and complementary approaches to
			psychiatric illness to mainstream mental health
			professionals, and to promote collaboration and research
			between mental health practitioners and practitioners of
			alternative medicine.</P>
			
			<P>Attendees will be introduced to some of the basic
			principles of homeopathy, Chinese traditional medicine,
			Ayurvedic medicine, Shamanism, meditation, and spiritual
			methods. The symposium is open to health care professionals
			across the spectrum.</P>
			
			<P>Dr Jacques Bradwejn who is hosting the program, said the
			impetus for the symposium was twofold: to build bridges
			between alternative and orthodox modes of treatment, and to
			encourage medical practitioners to adopt a more holistic
			approach to the treatment of mental illness.</P>
			
			<P>&quot;We don't talk the same language. In the
			conventional medical model, we define illness by
			symptomology - we make diagnoses and design treatments to
			eliminate symptoms. Alternative approaches tend to be less
			categorical and far more global and preventative. They talk
			about health and illness in terms of balance and energy.
			Their treatment approach is to restore health and mental
			states within the context of a defined philosophical and
			spiritual system.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Dr Bradwejn, who is Professor of Psychiatry at U of T and
			heads the Psychobiology and Clinical Trials Unit in Anxiety
			at The Clarke, believes that psychiatry, and medicine in
			general, has focused on the biological aspects of illness to
			the exclusion of &quot;the spirit and the even to some
			extent, the mind&quot;. He believes alternative medicine has
			much to offer; he advocates a more integrated approach.</P>
			
			<P>&quot;We need to evolve an integrated model of wellness
			in which people are healed by removing blocks to wellness.
			By definition, that must incorporate the spiritual as well
			as the physical.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Earlier this year, Dr Bradwejn was instrumental in
			bringing Dr Yue-Ping Zhou, an expert in Chinese herbal
			remedies, to The Clarke to participate in a major group
			study of the biology of anxiety. Dr Zhou is investigating
			specific herbal remedies as possible alternative or
			complementary therapies for anxiety disorders. Dr Zhou was
			brought in after investigators observed that herbs used in
			Chinese, Indian, and Korean traditional medicine, were
			effective in treating symptoms of anxiety. Research suggests
			that the herbs act on the neurotransmitter cholecystokinin
			(CCK) - which plays a key role in panic and other anxiety
			disorders.</P>

			Catherine Moravac, phone: (416) 979-4747 ext 2643 or fax:
			(416) 979-4970.</P>
			
			<P><B>Keynote Speakers:</B></P>
			
			<P>Dr John Kabat-Zinn is founder and director of the Stress
			Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical
			Centre (UMMC), Associate Professor of Medicine in the
			Division of Preventive and Behavorial Medicine, and
			Executive Director of the newly established UMMC Centre for
			Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society. His major
			research interests are in mind/body interactions for healing
			and in the clinical applications of mindfulness meditation
			for chronic pain and stress-related disorders.</P>
			
			<P>Dr Jerry Cott has a Ph.D in pharmacology and expertise in
			drug development - both in western and Ayurvedic herbal
			medicines. Dr Cott has spent six years in the pharmaceutical
			industry in the U.S. including four years as a reviewer of
			new drug applications to the Food and Drug Administration.
			Currently he is Chief of the Pharmacological Treatment
			Research Program for the National Institute of Mental
			Health. Dr Cott hopes to promote medicinal plant research
			among the mainstream scientific community. He believes that
			studying botanical remedies will both lead to useful
			treatments and increase understanding of the biology of
			mental disorders.</P>
			
			<P>Psychotherapist, Dr Kenneth Wapnick, has a Ph.D. in
			clinical psychology has been working with a Course in
			Miracles since 1973 - a self-initiated method of healing. He
			has written and lectured extensively on the Course as well
			as conducting a practice in psychotherapy. He is President
			and co-founder with his wife of the Foundation for A Course
			in Miracles, the teaching organization of the Foundation for
			Inner Peace. Dr Wapnick has travelled nationally and
			internationally giving workshops on the course.</P>
			
			<P>Dr Jacques Bradwejn, Head of the Psychobiology &amp;
			Clinical Trials Research Unit in Anxiety, has recently
			returned from a lecture tour of France where he spoke about
			the trend toward integrating research across disciplines and
			across all levels of analysis - an approach being
			spearheaded at The Clarke. He was invited to speak by the
			European Community organization, Erasmus, which trains young
			researchers. He gave presentations at Universities in Paris,
			Nantes, and Bordeaux.</P>
			
			<P>This integrated approach is currently being employed in a
			$1.6 million multi-site, group study of the biology of
			anxiety disorder, being led by Drs Franco Vaccarino,
			Bradwejn, and Sid Kennedy of The Clarke's Mood &amp; Anxiety
			Division. Worldwide, this is possibly the only group to
			methodically target the brain mechanisms and genetics of
			anxiety across all levels of analysis - from basic to
			clinical studies - across several levels of expertise -
			biochemical, pharmacological, technological, and clinical
			researchers from several disciplines.</P>
			
			<P>Dr Yue-Ping Zhou, an expert in Chinese herbal remedies,
			has joined The Clarke as a research fellow in a major group
			study of the biology of anxiety. Dr Zhou, (not to be
			confused with Dr Qun-Yong Zhou who is heading the new
			Transgenic research Facility), is investigating traditional
			herbal remedies as possible alternative or complementary
			therapies for anxiety disorders. He was hired after
			researchers in the project discovered that particular herbs
			used in Chinese, Indian, and Korean traditional medicine,
			were effective in treating symptoms of anxiety. Research
			suggests that the herbs act on the neurotransmitter
			cholecystokinin (CCK) which plays a key role in panic and
			other anxiety disorders. While at The Clarke, Dr Zhou will
			be working under the co-supervision of the Dr Franco
			Vaccarino and Dr Jacques Bradwejn.</P>
			
			<P>As an extension of this renewed interest in alternative
			medical approaches to mental illness, a two-day symposium
			and public forum on Psychiatry and Alternative Medicine is
			being planned for ..... this year. The purposes of the
			symposium are twofold: to introduce alternative and
			complementary approaches to psychiatric illness to mental
			health professionals and family physicians, and to establish
			working relationships with specialists in these areas as the
			basis for future research. In addition to alternative
			physical modes of treatment (herbs, acupuncture, massage),
			the symposium will address spiritual approaches including
			Buddhist and Christian-based spiritual/psychiatric
			systems.</P>

			<P><B>Creativity &amp; Psychosis: Schizophrenia Art Exhibit
			Huge Success</B></P>
			
			<P>&quot;Mental illness has made my life a desert, where art
			is a cooling respite from the intense sun which is
			death.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Art as oasis; Alan Parker reflects on his art in the
			context of his twenty-year struggle with schizophrenia,
			manic depression, and thoughts of suicide.</P>
			
			<P>The funding, the forum, the support, the recognition, the
			chance to show that schizophrenia is a many-faceted
			phenomenon - these were the goals of the Clarke Institute of
			Psychiatry's Schizophrenia Art Exhibit on June 26. Fifteen
			clients of The Clarke's Schizophrenia Division showed their
			work - sculpture, painting, and drawing, ranging from mixed
			media to oil, abstract to figurative. Art Show organizer Dr.
			Mary Seeman, Head of the University of Toronto Schizophrenia
			Program, says:</P>
			
			<P>&quot;We had several goals in staging the art show. The
			first was to support these artists financially. The second
			to provide a forum for mounting and selling their work - The
			Clarke itself purchased a number of pieces. Thirdly, to help
			them achieve the public recognition they deserve. And
			finally - and very importantly - to make mental health
			professionals and the public aware that these clients are
			much more than 'just chronic patients'; they are highly
			creative. Many, many clients in the Schizophrenia Division
			are extremely talented, but had neither the money for art
			supplies nor the venue to show their work. We very
			specifically invited a large number of young doctors
			training in psychiatry so that they could see that this
			illness has many faces. Our hope is to encourage some to
			work in the schizophrenia area when they graduate.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>For many of the exhibitors, their illness has both
			informed and shaped their art. Michael's pencil drawings are
			uncompromisingly, almost eerily realistic. But in a future
			project he plans to draw on the delusions, obsessions,
			suspicions, and pervading sense of alienation that have
			dogged him throughout phases of his illness, and turned
			these dark themes into elements in an illustrated science
			fantasy. Now that Michael is able to step back from this
			thinking, he is able to reconstruct his delusions and
			experiences as a rich reservoir of ideas. Now his interest
			in the &quot;bizarre and the weird&quot; is in how it serves
			his art. &quot;It has turned into a form of reality
			testing,&quot; he says, allowing him to separate the real
			from the unreal.</P>
			
			<P>Miron Semec, who studied art in a program for
			artistically gifted children in his native Czechoslovakia,
			says his art has soothed him during crises in his illness,
			allowing him to distance himself from his disease and retain
			a broader outlook. He imbues his paintings - largely
			figurative works of landscapes and people - with the smells,
			colours, and sensations of a happy childhood. His goal: to
			make viewers of his work &quot;feel good, to free them of
			their burdens,&quot; and create for them, like himself,
			&quot;a sense of normalcy&quot;. Fulfilling his long-time
			hope to be both artist and teacher, today he teaches art to
			children in a community program.</P>
			
			<P>As part of the Exhibition, Dr. Vivian Rakoff, Professor
			Emeritus and former Clarke Psychiatrist -in- Chief ,
			presented a lecture on &quot;Creativity and Psychosis&quot;.
			Dr. Rakoff spoke on creativity as a means to connect with
			fellow human beings and psychosis as an illness that breaks
			down that connection.</P>
			
			<P>The pharmaceutical company, Hoescht Marion Roussel,
			donated funds for the lecture and costs associated with
			mounting the exhibition - framing, easels, transportation of
			art - costs that would normally have been insurmountable

			<P><B>New Study Improves Treatment &amp; Saves Drug &amp;
			Hospital Costs: Shows Schizophrenic Patients Do Better On
			Fraction Of Usual Dose</B></P>
			
			<P>&quot;The problem with many antipsychotic drugs, is that
			the side-effects can be so awful that patients become
			convinced the drug is the enemy, and stop taking it. When
			that happens they often lapse into psychosis and have to be
			hospitalized. Since these drugs are the best available
			treatment for schizophrenia, and the cost and side effects
			of these drugs are considerable, it is imperative that we
			find the lowest effective dose.&quot; Dr Shitij Kapur,
			Clarke Institute of Psychiatry Schizophrenia Division &amp;
			the University of Toronto Schizophrenia Program</P>
			
			<P>A team of Clarke Institute of Psychiatry researchers have
			found that patients with schizophrenia improve on far lower
			doses of antipsychotic medication than traditionally
			prescribed, and with far fewer of the debilitating side
			effects. Their finding could improve the life of individuals
			with schizophrenia and save millions in drug and hospital
			costs. On the basis of this work, Dr Kapur who led the
			research, encourages clinicians initiating treatment for
			schizophrenia to use low doses of typical antipsychotics -
			particularly for patients experiencing their first episode
			of psychosis. The findings have been published in the July
			issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry.</P>
			
			<P>Despite 30 years of using antipsychotics, there is still
			no consensus regarding the right dose. Until recently, the
			standard dose of the most-conventionally prescribed
			antipsychotic, haloperidol, was 20 milligrams per day.
			However, clinical experience with patients in The Clarke's
			First Episode Psychosis Program who could not tolerate
			standard doses, has shown that many patients improve with
			much lower doses of medication - some as low as 2
			milligrams. To develop a more objective approach to dosing,
			Dr Shitij Kapur (Deputy Head for Research, Schizophrenia
			Division, Clarke Institute; Fellow, U of T), Dr Robert
			Zipursky (Head, Schizophrenia Division, Clarke Institue;
			Associate Professor, U of T), Dr Gary Remington (Deputy
			Head, Postgraduate Education, Schizophrenia Division, Clarke
			Institute; Associate Professor, U of T), and Dr Philip
			Seeman (Professor, Pharmacology, U of T) have been
			conducting clinical trials in conjunction with positron
			emission tomography (PET) brain-imaging studies. The PET
			scans show the precise effect of the drug in different
			regions of the brain.</P>
			
			<P>Most scientists believe that psychosis in schizophrenia
			is caused by excessive activity of the chemical
			(neurotransmitter) dopamine which transmits messages between
			brain cells, and that antipsychotics
															....2 work
			by zeroing in on and binding with the tiny receptors which
			'stick out' from neurons and cling to dopamine molecules.
			The binding action of the drug blocks transmission between
			cells and results in controlling psychosis. Working with a
			group of patients from The Clarke First Episode Clinic, Dr
			Kapur has led PET studies to examine what is happening at
			the receptor level with low doses of medication. They found
			that doses of about 2 milligrams a day blocked an average of
			67% of the dopamine receptor; this is sufficient to produce
			good response in patients.					</P>
			
			<P>&quot;There is considerable variability in individual
			response to antipsychotics. That some patients may require
			higher doses does not mean that all patients should be
			started on high doses.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>Headed by Dr Robert Zipursky, the multidisciplinary team
			in the First Episode Psychosis Program provides rapid and
			comprehensive treatment to patients experiencing their first
			episode or first break of psychosis. Their approach is based
			on evidence that early intervention minimizes further
			deterioration and improves long-term prognosis.</P>
			
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry is a research
			institute fully affiliated with the University of
			Toronto.</P>
			
			<P><B>Schizophrenia</B></P>
			
			<P>Schizophrenia, once thought to be a reaction to stress
			and family influences during childhood, is now recognized as
			a brain disease of unknown cause. Afflicting 1% of the
			general population - at least 250,000 Canadians,160 million
			worldwide - schizophrenia occurs at equal rates in males and
			females and cuts across all levels of education and
			intelligence, all cultures, all social classes. Described as
			'youth's greatest disabler', schizophrenia runs a chronic
			course. After the initial onset, usually in late
			adolescence, symptoms abate and reappear in cycles for many
			years. The first decade of illness is the most severe. Ten
			years after a first psychotic episode, 25% of patients will
			have have recovered completely; 25% will have improved
			moderately; 25% will have improved but still require
			significant ongoing medical, financial, occupational,
			social, residential, and psychological support; 15% will be
			hospitalized intermittently; 10% will have committed
			suicide.</P>
			
			<P>Current treatment for schizophrenia consists of
			antipsychotic medications supported by intensive
			psychosocial rehabilitation therapies. However, while
			existing medications control certain symptoms - albeit
			imperfectly - they can produce serious side effects ranging
			from involuntary muscle movements and spasms, to a number of
			hormonal, allergic, neurological, and psychological
			problems. Newer antipsychotic drugs are being actively
			tested and may hold the key for safer and more effective
			treatment. Cures are still years away.</P>
			
			<P>The costs are enormous. Schizophrenia accounts for 2.5%
			of total health care expenditures in any province - far more
			than any other serious illness. In Canada, people with
			chronic schizophrenia occupy 8% of all hospital beds - more
			beds than people suffering from cancer, heart disease,
			diabetes, and arthritis combined. It is estimated that
			schizophrenia costs Canadian society more than $4 billion
			per year - $2.3 billion in direct health care costs and $2
			billion in indirect costs such as welfare and support
			payments. The emotional cost to the individuals and their
			families is incalculable.</P>

			<P><B>Serotonin-Dopamine Interaction Holds Key For Improved
			Treatment Of Schizophrenia</B></P>
			
			<P>Combining typical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin
			treatment may provide more effective treatment for
			schizophrenia. This theory stems from research on the latest
			generation of neuroleptics - clozapine and risperidone -
			which act on both the serotonin and dopamine
			neurotransmitter systems. Clarke Institute of Psychiatry
			investigators, Dr Shitij Kapur and Dr Gary Remington,
			believe that the serotonin-dopamine interaction holds the
			key for treating a wider array of symptoms and reducing
			movement disorders* which are common side effects of typical
			neuroleptic treatment. Their findings - Serotonin-Dopamine
			Interaction and Its Relevance to Schizophrenia - were
			published as a special article in the April 1996 Issue of
			the American Journal of Psychiatry. This research builds on
			their own clinical and PET brain imaging research examining
			newer neuroleptics - their action, clinical outcome, and
			correlation with movement disorders.</P>
			
			<P>The therapeutic success of clozapine and risperidone has
			focused attention on the interaction between the serotonin
			and dopamine systems - both of which have long-been
			implicated in the cause of schizophrenia. Convincing
			evidence now suggests that the serotonin system inhibits
			dopaminergic function at two levels - the midbrain and
			forebrain - and that this inhibition may help in alleviating
			neuroleptic-induced side effects and treating negative
			symptoms**.</P>
			
			<P>Drs Kapur and Remington, both of the University of
			Toronto's Department of Psychiatry Schizophrenia Program
			based at The Clarke, theorize that these drugs achieve their
			effects by manipulating the serotonin system so as to reduce
			its inhibiting effect on the dopamine system. However, the
			researchers point out that the effects of the
			serotonin-dopamine interaction are different in different
			brain regions. They also caution that the benefits of the
			serotonin-dopamine interaction should only be expected
			within a narrow dose range and may be lost with higher
			dosage levels. 			</P>
			
			<P>Given the difficulty of producing the optimal
			serotonin-dopamine interaction in a one drug, Drs Kapur and
			Remington raise the possiblity of using serotonergic
			treatments as adjuncts to typical neuroleptics rather than a
			single drug with a combined action. Since all individuals
			respond differently, they suggest that controling
			serotonergic and dopaminergic function independently may
			allow physicians to determine the most beneficial levels for
			each individual. &quot;The crucial element is not the
			balance of serotonin and dopamine affinities of a given drug
			in a test tube, but the relevant levels it produces in a
			patient.&quot;</P>
			
			<P>The paper also points to ongoing research using PET
			brain-imaging technology to determine the right dosage for
			these medications</P>
			
			<P><B>Appendix</B></P>
			
			<P>* Movement disorders are side effects of antipsychotics
			and may be seen in up to 75% of patients. The occur as a
			result of the effects of antipsychotics on the dopamine
			system and cause patients to experience stiffness and
			tremors, much like Parkinson's disease; as a result,
			patients often stop taking their medication. It is believed
			that serontonin-dopamine interaction may alleviate movement
			disorders.</P>
			
			<P>** Negative symptoms in schizophrenia refer to a loss of
			normal function which includes restricted range and
			intensity of emotional expression, loss of fluency and
			productivity of thought and speech, and loss of motivation.
			Typical antipsychotics address positive symptoms -
			delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and grossly
			disorganized or catatonic behaviour - but have limited
			impact on negative symptoms. So despite being freed from
			their delusions and halluciations, many patients remain
			emotionally withdrawn, alienated, estranged, and therefore,
			unable to resume productive lives. It is hoped that
			treatments using the serotonin-dopamine interaction will
			have special effects on negative symptoms.</P>

			working in partnership with the Consumer Facilitator at the
			Clarke, in the new Consumer Facilitator and Information
			Centre on the ground floor of the Institute in Room G46A,
			ext 2729. Clients and staff of the Clarke are invited to
			drop in for an introduction to the services.  Chris
			Whittaker, the coordinator, is already known to some of us
			at The Clarke as he attends the discharge planning meeting
			in GPU and a similar meeting on the CIU. Chris will be open
			for business in October and will take the rest of this month

			<TD><P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry is located in the
			heart of downtown Toronto, Ontario at 250 College Street,
			just a little east of Spadina Avenue. If you are coming by
			public transit (the easiest way) the TTC's Spadina #77 bus
			or the Carlton #506 Streetcar both stop only steps away from
			our front door. If you're coming by car, be aware that
			parking is very limited. There is a parking garage we share
			with the <A HREF="http://www.arf.org/">Addiction Research
			Foundation</A>; the entrance is off Spadina just north of
			College. The garage is often full during the day, but you
			can usually find a spot in the evening. There is some
			metered parking on Spadina and there is the Kensington
			Municipal Parking lot south off Spadina. If you're coming by
			bike, there are bike racks by the Spadina entrance.</P>
			
			<P>There are 2 entrances, the main entrance on College
			Street and the Spadina entrance at the bottom of the
			driveway off Spadina, just north of College (best spot for
			drop-off.)</P>
			
			<P>Here's a <A HREF="map.html">map of the area</A>.

			<TD><P>This drug is used to treat symptoms of depression.
			Depression is a disorder which goes beyond feelings of
			sadness or unhappiness. The symptoms which go to make up
			this disorder include sleeping and eating difficulties, low
			sex drive, poor concentration, trouble with self esteem and
			a sense of hopelessness. The duration is usually more than
			one week.</P>
			
			<P>One of the treatment methods for depression is the use of
			medications called antidepressants. The antidepressants act
			by changing levels of certain chemicals in the brain. They
			are not &quot;uppers&quot; nor do they stimulate the
			individual. The drugs may take from a few days to four weeks
			to be really effective, so patience is needed to give the
			drug a chance to work. Early signs of improvement are
			increased appetite, better sleep and increased energy. Even
			though they take a while to work there is a high likelihood
			of success. It is very important that the therapy program is
			not discontinued, interrupted or changed in any way without
			consulting your doctor. Usually, it is necessary to continue
			the medication for six months to a year to be sure the
			depression will not return. If a patient continually
			relapses into depression, he/she may need to continue to
			take the medication in maintenance doses for several years.
			If any change in medication or alteration in dose is
			required, this should be done at the discretion of your
			doctor.</P>

			<TD><P><B>Side Effects</B></P>
			
			<P>As with any other effective medication, unwanted side
			effects may develop. In most cases, these respond to
			treatment or disappear as therapy is continued. Occasionally
			the dose may be reduced by your doctor. Side effects may
			sometimes occur before beneficial effects are noticed.
			Although annoying, it is important that you do not stop your
			medication without checking first with your doctor, since
			this is an indication that the drug is being absorbed into
			the body and is beginning to work.</P>
			
			<P>Side effects are usually not serious or troublesome. They
			will respond to appropriate treatment, and will decrease or
			disappear with time.</P>

			<P>If you take your total dose of antidepressant in the
			morning (e.g. fluoxetine), and you miss a dose by more than

			missed dose when you remember, then continue with your
			regular schedule. If you miss more than one dose, contact

			<TD><P>This drug is used to treat symptoms of depression.
			Depression is a disorder which goes beyond feelings of
			sadness or unhappiness. The symptoms which go to make up
			this disorder include sleeping and eating difficulties, low
			sex drive, poor concentration, trouble with self esteem and
			a sense of hopelessness. The duration is usually more than
			one week.</P>
			
			<P>One of the treatment methods for depression is the use of
			medications called antidepressants. The antidepressants act
			by changing levels of certain chemicals in the brain. They
			are not &quot;uppers&quot; nor do they stimulate the
			individual. The drugs may take from a few days to four weeks
			to be really effective, so patience is needed to give the
			drug a chance to work. Early signs of improvement are
			increased appetite, better sleep and increased energy. Even
			though they take a while to work there is a high likelihood
			of success. It is very important that the therapy program is
			not discontinued, interrupted or changed in any way without
			consulting your doctor. Usually, it is necessary to continue
			the medication for six months to a year to be sure the
			depression will not return. If a patient continually
			relapses into depression, he/she may need to continue to
			take the medication in maintenance doses for several years.
			If any change in medication or alteration in dose is
			required, this should be done at the discretion of your
			doctor.</P>

			<P>As with any other effective medication, unwanted side
			effects may develop. In most cases, these respond to
			treatment or disappear as therapy is continued. Occasionally
			the dose may be reduced by your doctor. Side effects may
			sometimes occur before beneficial effects are noticed.
			Although annoying, it is important that you do not stop your
			medication without checking first with your doctor, since
			this is an indication that the drug is being absorbed into
			the body and is beginning to work.</P>
			
			<P>Side effects are usually not serious or troublesome. They
			will respond to appropriate treatment, and will decrease or
			disappear with time.</P>

			<TD><P>Neuroleptics are also called antipsychotics or major
			tranquilizers. This medication is used to treat symptoms of
			acute or chronic psychosis including schizophrenia, mania
			and organic disorders. Schizophrenia is believed to be
			caused by an overabundance of brain chemicals called
			dopamine, and Neuroleptics are thought to work by blocking
			the dopamine effect. A major part of effective therapy is
			the use of medication and the chance for recovery is
			good.</P>
			
			<P>The drug relieves anxiety in about 1 week, helps control
			mood changes in about 2 weeks, and difficulties in thinking
			and awareness in 6 to 8 weeks. As can be seen, patience is
			needed in order to give the drug a chance to work, and it is
			very important that the therapy program is not discontinued,
			interrupted, or changed in any way without consulting your
			doctor, since this may result in the recurrence of the basic
			disease symptoms and rehospitalizaton within 3 to 12 months.
			If any change in medication or alteration in dose is
			required, this should be done at the discretion of your
			doctor.</P>

			<TD><P><B>Side Effects</B></P>
		
			<P>As with any other effective medication, unwanted side
			effects may develop. In most cases, these respond to
			treatment or disappear as therapy is continued. Side effects
			may sometimes occur before beneficial effects are noticed.
			Although these side effects may be annoying, it is important
			that you do not stop your medication without checking first
			with your doctor, since this is an indication that the drug
			is being absorbed into the body and is beginning to
			work.</P>
			
			<P>MILD SIDE EFFECTS which should be reported to your doctor
			at the NEXT APPOINTMENT include:</P>

			tardive dyskinesia improves the chance that this adverse

				<LI>Antacids (e.g. Gelusil, Maalox, Amphogel, etc) interfere with absorption of these drugs and therefore may decrease their effect. To avoid this, if you are taking antacids, take the antacid at least 2 hours before or 1 hour after taking your other medication.
				<LI>Avoid exposure to extreme heat and humidity, since this drug may affect your body's ability to regulate temperature.
				<LI>Some patients may get a serious sunburn with little exposure to sunlight. Avoid direct sun, and use a sunscreen preparation (containing PABA -- e.g. Eclipse) on exposed areas.
				<LI>Check with your doctor before taking other drugs including over-the-counter medications such as cold remedies, etc.

			<TD><P>This drug is used to treat symptoms of depression.
			Depression is a disorder which goes beyond feelings of
			sadness or unhappiness. The symptoms which go to make up
			this disorder include sleeping and eating difficulties, low
			sex drive, poor concentration, trouble with self-esteem and
			a sense of hopelessness. The duration is usually more than
			one week.</P>
			
			<P>One of the treatment methods for depression is the use of
			medication called antidepressants. One group of
			antidepressants are the Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (e.g.
			Nardil and Parnate). The antidepressants act by changing
			levels of certain chemicals in the brain. They are not
			&quot;uppers&quot; nor do they stimulate the individual. The
			drugs may take from a few days to several weeks to be really
			effective, so patience is needed to give the drug a chance
			to work. Early signs of improvement are increased appetite,
			better sleep and increased energy. Even though they may take
			a while to work there is a high likelihood of success. It is
			very important that the program is not discontinued,
			interrupted or changed in any way without consulting your
			doctor. Because of the risk of depression returning, it is
			necessary to continue the medication for six months to a
			year. If a patient continually relapses into depression, he
			may need to continue to take the medication in small
			maintenance doses for several years. If any change in
			medication or alteration in dose is required, this should be
			done at the discretion of your doctor.</P>

			<TD><P><B>Side Effects</B></P>
		
			<P>As with any other effective medication, unwanted side
			effects may develop. In most cases these lessen as therapy
			is continued. Occasionally the dose may be reduced by your
			doctor. Side effects may sometimes occur before beneficial
			effects are noticed. Although side effects are annoying, it
			is important that you do not stop your medication without
			first checking with your doctor. Side effects are an
			indication that the drug is being absorbed into the body and
			is beginning to work.</P>

			<TD><P>The medication you are taking is called Lithium
			Carbonate. Lithium has been found useful in the treatment of
			mood disorders, where a person's mood changes from a
			depressed feeling to a high feeling, or vice versa. Some
			people suffer from recurrent mood swings, others from
			depression only.</P>
			
			<P>Lithium has been found to prevent further episodes or
			lessen the severity of the illness in the majority of people
			treated.</P>
			
			<P>Lithium has no sedative properties and does not interfere
			with intellectual productivity or normal emotions. Lithium
			acts as a mood stabilizer; however, you may still have to
			adjust to some of the problems of living, such as being a
			member of a family, or working, or enjoying your leisure
			time.</P>
			
			<P>Lithium is a simple element in the same family as sodium
			(table salt). It is found in nature in some mineral waters
			and is also present in small amounts in the human body. In
			medical treatment, it is prescribed as a lithium salt,
			usually as Lithium Carbonate.</P>
			
			<P>The dose of lithium is different for every patient based
			on how much lithium is in the blood and the response to
			treatment. Blood samples are taken regularly to be sure the
			dose is neither too high nor too low.</P>

			<OL>
				<LI>Take your lithium exactly as prescribed. Do not change the daily dosage or schedule without consulting your doctor, even if there is a change in the way you feel. Taking less lithium may not be effective, and taking more can make you sick. Only your doctor can tell if a change in dose may be beneficial.
				<LI>Take your medication with food or milk unless otherwise directed; this will help prevent nausea.
				<LI>It is important to drink 8-12 cups of fluid per day. (e.g. water, juice, milk, broth, etc.)
				<LI>Do not change your salt intake during your course of treatment (avoid low, or no-salt diets) 
				<LI>On the morning of your lithium blood test, take the morning dose of lithium after the test to avoid inaccurate results.
				<LI>Should you accidently miss taking your lithium, do not try to make up for it by taking more the next time. Just stick to the recommended dosage, and your proper lithium level will be reached again shortly.
				<LI>If you have the flu or a fever, check with your doctor regarding your lithium.
				<LI>Use extra care in hot weather and during activities that cause you to sweat heavily, such as hot baths, saunas, or exercising. The loss of too much water and salt from your body may lead to changes in the level of lithium in your body.
				<LI>Be patient when taking lithium. Some people feel better as soon as they begin taking it, others improve after several months. Do not cut down on your medication once you begin feeling better, without talking with your doctor.
				<LI>Inform your nearest relative or friend that you are being treated with lithium and read over these instructions together.
				<LI>Tablets or capsules of lithium should be swallowed whole. Do not crush.
				<LI>This drug may delay reaction time. Use caution when driving a car or operating other machinery.
			</OL>
		
			<P>If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact
			either your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.</P>

			<TD><P>This medication has been found useful in treating
			schizophrenia and other psychiatric problems. Its advantage
			over oral medication is that the effects of one injection
			usually last from 1 to _ weeks, thus eliminating the need to
			remember to take medication daily by mouth. Some patients do
			not absorb drugs well when taken by mouth, so an injection
			may be prescribed for them.</P>
			
			<P>The injection is usually given into a muscle, is
			generally painless and does not usually cause a local
			reaction. The site of injection is rotated since these
			injections may be given for several years.</P>
			
			<P>A positive response is usually noticed in most patients
			in 1 to 3 days after the first injection. Generally your
			doctor will start with a low dose and increase the amount
			over a period of weeks until the effective dose is reached.
			This is done to decrease the possibility of unwanted side
			effects.</P>

			<TD><P><B>Side Effects</B></P>

			<P>As with other effective medication, unwanted side effects
			may develop. If side effects occur, they do so usually
			within the first 12 to 24 hours after the initial injection
			and decrease or disappear within 3 to 7 days. Of course,
			both the nature and timing of side effects varies with
			individual patients. Mild side effects which should be
			reported to your doctor at the next appointment include:</P>

			<TD><P>The medication you are taking is called Divalproex,
			Valproic acid or Valproate.</P>
			
			<P>Divalproex has traditionally been used to treat epilepsy.
			It has been found useful in the treatment of mood disorders,
			where a patient's mood changes from a depressed feeling to a
			high feeling, or vice versa. When taken regularly as
			prescribed, divalproex helps control these mood swings and
			may prevent further episodes. It has been found helpful in
			patients whose mood swings occur frequently, and in those
			patients who do not respond to lithium carbonate.</P>
			
			<P>The dose of divalproex depends on the amount of drug in
			the blood. Blood samples are taken regularly to check
			whether your dose is too high or too low.</P>

			<TD><P>This drug is used to treat symptoms of depression.
			Depression is a disorder which goes beyond feelings of
			sadness or unhappiness. The symptoms which go to make up
			this disorder include sleeping and eating difficulties, low
			sex drive, poor concentration, trouble with self esteem and
			a sense of hopelessness. The duration is usually more than
			one week.</P>
			
			<P>One of the treatment methods for depression is the use of
			medications called antidepressants. The antidepressants act
			by changing levels of certain chemicals in the brain. They
			are not "uppers" nor do they stimulate the individual. The
			drugs may take from a few days to four weeks to be really
			effective, so patience is needed to give the drug a chance
			to work. Early signs of improvement are increased appetite,
			better sleep and increased energy. Even though they take a
			while to work there is a high likelihood of success. It is
			very important that the therapy program is not discontinued,
			interrupted or changed in any way without consulting your
			doctor. Usually, it is necessary to continue the medication
			for six months to a year to be sure the depression will not
			return. If a patient continually relapses into depression,
			he/she may need to continue to take the medication in small
			maintenance doses for several years. If any change in
			medication or alteration in dose is required, this should be
			done at the discretion of your doctor.</P>

			<P>As with any other effective medication, unwanted side
			effects may develop. In most cases, these respond to
			treatment or disappear as therapy is continued. Occasionally
			the dose may be reduced by your doctor. Side effects may
			sometimes occur before beneficial effects are noticed.
			Although annoying, it is important that you do not stop your
			medication without checking first with your doctor, since
			this is an indication that the drug is being absorbed into
			the body and is beginning to work.</P>
			
			<P>Side effects are usually not serious or troublesome. They
			will respond to appropriate treatment, and will decrease or
			disappear with time.</P>

			<TD><P>Clozapine belongs to the group of drugs called
			neuroleptics, (antipsychotics or major tranquilizers). This
			medication is used to treat symptoms of acute or chronic
			schizophrenia, in patients who have not had an adequate
			response to other neuroleptic drugs.</P>
			
			<P>The dose of clozapine is usually increased gradually over
			a number of weeks until a beneficial level is reached. It
			may take up to 8 weeks before you will notice a change in
			mood, awareness, or difficulties in thinking. Therefore
			patience is needed in order to give the drug a chance to
			work. It is important that the therapy program is not
			discontinued, interrupted or changed in any way without
			consulting your doctor, since this may result in recurrence
			of the basic disease symptoms. If any change in medication
			or alteration in dose is required this should be done at the
			discretion of your doctor.</P>
			
			<P>Prescriptions for clozapine are written for a week at a
			time and a blood test, to check the white blood count, is
			required every week. Your doctor can keep you informed as to
			the results of your tests. You will be asked to sign a form
			consenting to the terms of the treatment.</P>

			<TD><P>The medication you are taking is called Carbamazepine.
			Carbamazepine has traditionally been used to treat epilepsy
			and trigeminal neuralgia. It has also been found useful in
			the treatment of mood disorders, where a person's mood
			changes from a depressed feeling to a high feeling, or vice
			versa. When taken regularly as prescribed, carbamazepine
			helps control these mood swings and usually helps prevent
			further episodes, in the majority of patients. It has been
			found helpful in patients whose mood swings occur frequently
			and in those patients who do not respond to lithium
			carbonate.</P>
			
			<P>The dose of carbamazepine is different for every patient
			based on the amount of drug in the blood. Blood samples are
			regularly taken to make sure that the dose is neither too
			high nor too low.</P>

			<TD><P>This medication is used to treat symptoms of anxiety.
			Anxiety is a universal human response to stress and is
			necessary for effective functioning and coping with the
			daily activities of living. It may, however, be a symptom of
			many other disorders both medical and psychiatric. There are
			many different types of anxiety and there are many different
			approaches to treating anxiety.</P>
			
			<P>The anxiolytic agents used today are mainly in the Valium
			group and are also called minor tranquilizers. Examples are
			Valium, Librium, Tranxene, Serax, Ativan, Loftran and Xanax
			(called benzo-diazepines) as well as Buspar.</P>
			
			<P>An anxiolytic agent helps to calm the patient and relieve
			anxiety without causing excessive sedation or motor
			incoordination. However, in high doses these drugs can be
			used to induce sleep. Anxiolytics will alleviate the
			symptoms of anxiety but will not alter the cause of the
			anxiety. Anxiety is usually self-limiting and so it is
			treated with short-term drug use. Anxiolytics are usually
			prescribed for a limited period of time because the effect
			of the drugs can be lost (tolerance). Tolerance usually
			develops after four months of continuous treatment.
			Psychological dependence (craving, habituation) and/or
			physical dependence may occur, however, the risk of
			dependence with anxiolytics is considered low. Withdrawal
			symptoms are likely to occur between 1 and 10 days after
			treatment is stopped, usually after higher doses have been
			given for a long time.</P>

			<TD><P>This medication is used to treat muscle side effects that
			some patients experience when they are being treated with
			neuroleptics (antipsychotics or major tranquilizers).</P>
			
			<P>Some of the muscle side effects which may be relieved by
			antiparkinsonian agents include:</P>
			
			<P><OL>
				<LI>Muscle spasms or contractions (e.g. in the neck or the eyes);
				<LI>Muscle rigidity, tremor or shuffling gait;
				<LI>Restlessness or 'nervous pacing';
				<LI>Muscle weakness, or a decrease or slowing of movement.
			</OL></P>
			
			<P>Most of the above side effects can be treated
			successfully with antiparkinsonian agents. Sometimes these
			drugs have to be given by injection for a quicker effect.
			Symptoms generally disappear within a few days. After 2 to 3
			weeks of treatment, the antiparkinsonian agent can be
			stopped to see if the muscle symptoms recur. If they do not,
			then the antiparkinsonian agent can be discontinued.</P>
			
			<P>Examples of antiparkinsonian agents include Cogentin,
			Kemadrin, Artane, Disipal, Symmetrel, Parsitan and
			Benadryl.</P>

			<TD><P>The Forensic Division provides assessment and consultation
			for individuals referred by the courts, as well as treatment
			of patients involved with the law, either currently or in
			the past. However, treatment is not provided to individuals
			with outstanding charges. Our multi-disciplinary team
			includes nurses, occupational therapists, psychiatrists,
			psychologists, psychometrists, recreational therapists, and
			social workers, as well as researchers from a variety of
			disciplines. Services are provided at two sites, the
			Forensic Outpatient Service, located on the fourth floor of
			the Clarke Institute, and the Metropolitan Toronto Forensic
			Services (METFORS), located nearby on the grounds of the
			Queen Street Mental Health Centre, a regional psychiatric
			facility.</P>

			<P>The Forensic Outpatient Service deals with a variety of
			patients currently or previously involved with the law, but
			focuses on sex offenders through the
			<A HREF="../about_services/forensic_division.html#sexual_behaviour_clinic">Sexual Behaviour Clinic</A>,
			and physically aggressive individuals through the
			<A HREF="../about_services/forensic_division.html#anger_management_clinic">Anger Management Clinic</A>.

			<A HREF="../about_services/forensic_division.html#law_and_mental_health">Law and Mental Health Program</A>.
			Many staff members work in more than one program or clinic.</P>

			<P>Division staff are involved in a wide variety of research
			and education activities, sponsoring conferences and
			lectures on forensic topics, receiving research grants or
			contracts from major funding agencies in Canada, and
			publishing work in professional journals and books. Some
			staff members are cross-appointed to the University of
			Toronto, and are involved in the supervision and teaching of
			students in nursing, occupational therapy, psychiatry,
			psychology, and social work.</P>

			<P><A NAME="metfors">METFORS</A> is a medium security
			facility consisting of an Inpatient Unit with 23 beds and a
			Brief Assessment Unit. Patients are remanded to the
			inpatient unit for a term of up to 30 days. METFORS responds
			to a variety of provisions within the Criminal Code of
			Canada relating to psychiatric assessment and consultation,
			including determination of fitness to stand trial and
			criminal responsibility. Referrals are made through the
			courts (mainly from Metropolitan Toronto, but sometimes from
			other parts of Ontario which may have few or no forensic
			services available to them). The Brief Assessment Unit
			operates three days a week. Although the majority of
			individuals seen in this unit are in custody, assessments
			may also be conducted for individuals who are not in
			custody.</P>

			<TD><P><B>Overview of the Program</B></P>
			
			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry was named after Dr. C.
			K. Clarke, a pioneer in Canadian psychiatry and the first
			professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto. It
			opened in 1966 and operates as a public hospital under the
			legislative auspices of the Ontario Mental Health
			Foundation. The Institute has its own board of trustees and
			is affiliated with the University of Toronto as a teaching
			hospital. It is an active treatment facility fully
			accredited by the Canadian Council on Health Facilities
			Accreditation and is a centre for education and research in
			the mental health field.</P>
			
			<P>The Institute is responsible for conducting clinical
			research, offering clinical service, and teaching mental
			health workers and others. It is a training centre for all
			mental health disciplines. Interns have access to a wide
			variety of lectures, seminars, and symposia, provided by
			faculty from The Clarke, as well as frequent visiting
			lecturers from around the world. The internship is
			especially interested in applicants who are bound for
			academic careers in university psychology departments,
			teaching hospitals, and other academic settings. Interns may
			choose to participate in research during the internship
			year. The library is well stocked and computer and
			audio-visual resources are excellent.</P>

			<P>In contrast to other internship programs in which
			rotations occur sequentially, psychology Interns at The
			Clarke Institute of Psychiatry are assigned to two major
			rotations that occur concurrently throughout the year. In
			addition, interns may seek additional training opportunities
			through informal, minor rotations with other supervisors in
			the institute. Our aim is to help interns to build upon
			their existing strengths as well as to gain expertise in
			areas with which they have had little experience. Therefore,
			at least one of the primary rotations is typically in an
			area with which the intern has some familiarity and
			expertise. In addition to the major and minor rotations,
			interns participate in two separate weekly seminar series.
			Finally, interns receive approximately a half day to conduct
			independent research or other activities of the intern's
			choice.</P>
			
			<P>Three interns are accepted each year. Typically, interns
			are assigned to major rotations within the adult (two
			interns) or child (one intern) tracks, although occasionally
			an intern may do major rotations from both tracks.
			Regardless of which track an intern chooses, he or she may
			do minor rotations with supervisors from other areas. For
			example, an intern who is working on two major rotations in
			the child track, may choose to see one or two adult clients
			under the supervision of a third faculty member.</P>
			
			<P>The Internship runs from September 1 to August 31, with
			three weeks for  vacation, various statutory holidays, and
			time to attend conferences. Stipend (based on 1996-1997
			year): Approximately $30 000 (including benefits).</P>

			<P><B><I>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy: Depression</I></B></P>
			
			<P><I>Primary Supervisors:</I><BR>
			Zindel V. Segal, Ph.D.<BR>
			Mark A. Lau, Ph.D.</P>

			<P>This rotation is conducted in the Cognitive Behaviour
			Therapy (CBT) Unit of the Mood and Anxiety Division of The
			Clarke Institute. The CBT Unit is a clinical/research
			out-patient treatment clinic that offers specialized
			training in short-term cognitive therapy for depressive
			based disorders (patients are seen over 20-weeks).
			Assessment of suitability for cognitive therapy is conducted
			as part of an initial evaluation procedure. The goals of the
			CBT Unit involve the provision of highly refined and
			well-researched clinical services. Investigations are
			conducted to evaluate treatment methods and to investigate
			vulnerability to psychological disorders. Given the clinical
			research role of this unit, patients are often concurrently
			participating in research trials which have a focus on the
			investigation of relapse and recovery following treatment. A
			current orientation of this unit is towards the study of
			vulnerability to major depressive disorder and the
			identification of cognitive markers. This unit also serves
			an important academic and teaching function for continued
			training of psychiatric residents and other mental health
			professionals who are interested in learning about the
			cognitive model of emotional disorders.</P>
			
			<P>Training opportunities on the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy
			Unit involve developing familiarity with diagnosis of:</P>
			
			<OL>
				<LI>Axis I affective disorder;
				<LI>Cognitive assessment of these disorders;
				<LI>Familiarity with administration of a short-term cognitive therapy protocol; and
				<LI>The selection interview for determination of suitability for cognitive treatment.
			</OL>

			<P>In addition, an emphasis on case formulation using a
			cognitive model of emotional disorders is stressed.</P>
			
			<P>There is also an emphasis on understanding the
			interaction between pharmacotherapy and psychological
			treatment of the disorder, the role of interpersonal factors
			in depression, and considerations relevant to treatment
			format selection (i.e., short-term or long-term in nature).
			Opportunities for participation in research are also
			available, yet may be limited by the interns' caseload and
			demands related to clinical service.</P>

			<P><B><I>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy: Anxiety Disorders</I></B></P>
			
			<P><I>Primary Supervisor:</I><BR>
			Martin M. Antony, Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>This rotation is conducted in the Anxiety Disorders
			Clinic (ADC), located in the Mood and Anxiety Division of
			The Clarke Institute. The ADC is a clinical and research
			unit headed by Dr. Richard Swinson and staffed by
			individuals from a wide range of disciplines including
			psychology, psychiatry, social work, and nursing. The clinic
			sees about 500 new referrals per year, many of whom are
			treated in cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological
			treatment programs. The principal disorders seen in the
			clinic include panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia,
			and obsessive compulsive disorder, although opportunities to
			work with individuals with other anxiety-related
			difficulties exist. Training of psychology interns includes
			opportunities to develop skills in clinical assessment,
			diagnostic interviewing, and cognitive-behavioural treatment
			(individual and group) of anxiety disorders. Although most
			clients seen are outpatients, inpatient experience may be
			available as well, especially with obsessive compulsive
			disorder. Also, interns are expected to become familiar with
			the relevant research literature.</P>
			
			<P>In addition to offering clinical services, the Anxiety
			Disorders Clinic is among the most active anxiety research
			centres in Canada. Research interests of clinic staff
			members include the development of short-term, cost
			effective assessments and treatments for anxiety as well as
			the role of cognitive-behavioural factors, biological
			factors, and their interaction in the etiology and treatment
			of anxiety disorders. Depending on the intern's interests
			and experience, opportunities to participate in clinical
			research projects or to develop new projects are available
			as time permits.</P>
			
			<P>Supervision includes weekly individual meetings as well
			as less frequent case conferences that include all clinic
			staff.</P>

			<P><B><I>Adult Forensic Outpatient Service</I></B></P>
			
			<P><I>Primary Supervisors:</I><BR>
			Howard Barbaree, Ph.D.<BR>
			John Arrowood, Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>The Adult Forensic Service is a clinical and research
			outpatient unit staffed by individuals from all the major
			mental health disciplines, including four full-time
			psychologists and one full-time psychometrist. The Clarke
			Forensic Service was one of the first forensic centres
			established in the country and continues to be at the
			forefront of research and treatment innovations. The
			Forensic Service specializes in the assessment and treatment
			of individuals who have been involved with some aspect of
			the legal system. Specialized clinical activities in which
			interns may be involved include the assessment and
			prediction of dangerousness, psycholegal assessment for the
			courts (including the assessment of psychopathic personality
			and posttraumatic stress), and the provision of expert
			testimony. Interns will become familiar with the psycholegal
			standards involved in forensic assessment and reporting to
			lawyers and the courts. Interns will also have the
			opportunity to take on individual psychotherapy clients and
			to take part in the sex offender and/or anger management
			group treatment programs. Supervision is provided on an
			individual basis. Additionally, interns will have the
			opportunity to attend the Forensic Division seminar series.
			Possibilities also exist for participation in clinical
			research efforts as time permits.</P>
			
			<P><B><I>Clinical Sexology Programme (Phallometric Laboratory)</I></B></P>
			
			<P><I>Primary Supervisor:</I><BR>
			Ray Blanchard, Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>Phallometric testing is a psychophysiological method for
			the assessment of erotic preferences in human males. In this
			procedure, a man's penile blood volume changes are monitored
			as he experiences a standard, prerecorded set of potentially
			erotic stimuli. The Clarke Phallometric Laboratory was
			established by Kurt Freund, MD, DSc., the first clinical
			sexologist to use penile plethysmography to assess erotic
			preferences in men. It is the oldest laboratory in North
			America for the phallometric assessment of sex offenders and
			paraphilics, and its instrumentation for the collection and
			processing of phallometric data is still the most
			sophisticated in North America, or indeed, in the world.</P>
			
			<P>Most men referred to the Laboratory have been charged
			with, or convicted of, sexual interaction with minors or
			sexual coercion of adult women; the differential diagnosis
			usually involves a determination of paraphilia versus sexual
			misconduct motivated by some other factor. The central goal
			of this internship position is to train the intern to
			administer phallometric tests and to interpret their output.
			Because phallometric testing is highly technical and
			involves the mastery of complex instrumentation, we will
			only consider applicants who will spend half of each work
			week in the Phallometric Laboratory for the entire year of
			their internship. The highly accurate but elaborate
			equipment used in The Clarke Laboratory often requires the
			examiner to supervise the subject while he places the penile
			transducer on his genital or to verify the placement of the
			apparatus in locating he source of equipment problems. For
			this reason, only males can be hired to work in the
			Phallometric Laboratory (Ontario Human Rights Commission
			Exemption File #257).</P>
			
			<P><B><I>Metropolitan Forensic Service (METFORS)</I></B></P>
			
			<P><I>Primary Supervisors:</I><BR>
			David Nussbaum, Ph.D.<BR>
			Percy Wright, Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>Metropolitan Forensic Service (METFORS) is one of two
			services in the Division of Forensic Psychiatry. METFORS
			provides assessments and consultations to the courts on
			far-ranging pre-trial and pre-sentence issues. In addition,
			the service maintains an important academic role in research
			and the advanced training of psychiatrists and
			psychologists.</P>
			
			<P>The primary training offered at METFORS in the assessment
			of complex clinical and psycholegal cases. Many patients
			have co-occurring Axis I and Axis II disorders, many of
			which are superimposed on substance abuse disorders. These
			patients provide a rich opportunity for diagnostic and
			personality assessments. In addition, interns become
			conversant in the application of psycholegal standards to
			in-patients referred by the courts. Interns must become
			knowledgeable regarding the literature on competency to
			stand trial, insanity, dangerous offender and
			treatability.</P>

			<P><B><I>General Adult Clinical Psychology</I></B></P>
			
			<P><I>Primary Supervisors:</I><BR>
			To be announced<BR>
			Laurie Gillies, Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>The General Adult Clinical Psychology Rotation includes
			opportunities to see outpatients in the Assessment Clinic,
			Interpersonal Therapy Clinic, Mood Disorders Program and
			Clinic, Psychotherapy Centre, Vocational Services, and
			Emergency Services. In addition, inpatient experience is
			available in the General Psychiatry Division and the
			Schizophrenia Research Program. Interns may be linked to one
			or more of these programs during this rotation.</P>
			
			<P>Experience is gained in both assessment and intervention.
			The specific nature or focus of the assessment training
			varies, dependent on the particular program. Patients are
			referred directly to the Psychology Department for
			psychotherapy so interns can receive training in supportive
			psychotherapy, case management procedures with chronic
			psychiatric disorders, psychodynamically-oriented
			psychotherapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Supervision
			of therapy is primarily on an individual basis via
			audiotapes of psychotherapy sessions. Long term cases may be
			carried through the year. Training in group therapy is also
			available.</P>
			
			<P>Assessment training is offered in psychodiagnostic work
			and includes instruction in such tests as the Rorschach,
			TAT, MMPI, MMPI-2, MCMI,-II, and WAIS-R. We also provide
			training in neuropsychological assessment using such tests
			as the Wechsler Memory, Bender-Gestalt, Benton
			Visual-Retention, the Halsted-Reitan battery, and the Luria
			Method. Training is available, as well, in specialized areas
			such as vocational aptitude and interest tests, and
			assessment via self-report measures for suitability for
			cognitive therapy. Interns may also receive training in
			diagnostic interviewing, history taking, and emergency
			evaluation. It is the intention of the training program
			committee that the intern function as much as possible as a
			staff member in a multi-disciplinary context. Interns are
			expected to attend and participate in appropriate unit
			meetings, rounds, and the like.</P>

			<P><B><I>Child and Family Studies Centre</I></B></P>

			<P><I>Primary Supervisors:</I><BR>
			Lynn Oldershaw, Ph.D.<BR>
			Meagan Smith, Ph.D.<BR>
			Arlene Young, Ph.D.<BR>
			Ken Zucker, Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>Psychology staff in the Child and Family Studies Centre
			currently includes 4 full-time psychologists, and 1
			part-time psychometrist.</P>
			
			<P>Interns will receive training in assessment, diagnosis,
			psychological testing, and therapeutic interventions.
			Interns can gain experience in a broad range of child
			psychopathologies, including the internalizing and
			externalizing disorders, learning and neuropsychological
			disabilities, affective disorders, pervasive developmental
			disorders, and gender identity disorders. Interns can also
			gain experience working with children from "at risk"
			backgrounds, including parents with affective disorder.
			Out-patient and day treatment settings constitute the core
			of the Department.</P>
			
			<P>Supervision is on an individual basis. There are also
			bi-weekly psychology meetings that are didactic in nature.
			The service itself also provides a range of educational
			opportunities.</P>

			<P><B><I>Family Court Clinic</I></B></P>
			
			<P><I>Primary Supervisors:</I><BR>
			Stephen Butler, Ph.D.<BR>
			Helen Radovanovic, Ph.D.</P>
			
			<P>The Family Court Clinic conducts clinical assessments of
			families and youth before the courts in the Toronto area.
			There are currently three specialized programs: 1) the
			Family Program, which deals with custody/visitation, and
			child welfare matters; 2) the Young Offender Program; 3) and
			the Arson Prevention Program for children. These assessments
			incorporate both clinical interviews and psychometric
			testing within the context of a multidisciplinary team
			model. In addition, the Family Court Clinic also provides
			individual and family treatment.</P>
			
			<P>The family program provides comprehensive assessment of
			parents and children involved in custody and visitation
			disputes. These families are characterized by high incidence
			of parental psychopathology, parental substance abuse,
			interparental aggression, and children's behavioural and
			emotional disturbance. The assessment focus on an evaluation
			of the child's needs, parenting ability, parent-child
			relationships, and the interparental relationship.
			Unstructured and structured clinical interviews,
			parent-child observations, and psychometric testing are
			typically used for the assessment. Therapeutic resolution of
			the parental disputes or mediation is provided, where
			applicable.</P>
			
			<P>The Adolescent Team primarily conducts court ordered
			assessments under the Young Offenders Act. Referrals are
			also accepted from community agencies such as probation,
			Children's Aid Societies and schools. The clinical issues
			involved in these assessments include the risk for
			recidivism and continued antisocial behaviour, the
			adolescent's general emotional and behavioural functioning,
			family functioning and the adolescent's and families ability
			to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The assessments
			are comprehensive and include individual and family
			interviews, psychological testing and/or psychiatric
			consultation where appropriate, and review of report from
			community agencies. The goal of the assessment is to assist
			the judge in making a disposition on the youth by providing
			a comprehensive understanding of the youth's clinical needs
			and making specific treatment recommendations. In addition,
			individual and family therapy for adolescents and their
			families are also part of the Adolescent Team.</P>
			
			<P>The Family Court Clinic has recently initiated The Arson
			Prevention Program for Children (TAPP-C). The program is
			designed to develop and test an assessment and intervention
			program for juvenile fire setters that will be implemented
			later on a province wide basis. Juvenile fire setters (ages
			2-16 years) and their families are assessed at the clinic.
			Structured interviews are used to examine the duration,
			breadth, and intensity of the child's fire setting
			behaviours and history. Standardized observations,
			interviews, and questionnaires are used to evaluate child
			and family psychopathology. An estimate of the child's risk
			for future fire setting is derived. Children are channelled
			into fire safety and education programs or mental-health
			treatment programs, as appropriate to their needs.</P>
			
			<P><B>Educational Seminars</B></P>
			
			<P>In addition to direct clinical experience, the internship
			requires the intern participate in a number of didactic
			educational experiences including the Clinical Seminar
			Series and the Continuing Case Conference. In addition,
			interns are encouraged to take advantage of other
			professional development activities including lectures,
			workshops, seminars and professional conferences, both
			within and outside the Institute.</P>
			
			<P><B>Clinical Seminar Series</B></P>
			
			<P>Seminars are provided every week by psychology staff at
			The Clarke Institute. Lectures are typically held at the
			site where each psychologist provides his or her direct
			treatment or assessment functions, so that interns can gain
			familiarity with the various practising sub-sections of The
			Clarke Institute's Department of Psychology even if they are
			not in contact during their ordinary rotations. The seminars
			are structured to provide information relevant to assessment
			and treatment issues as well as to enhance the professional
			functioning of interns vis a vis the independent practice of
			psychology.</P>
			
			<P>Topics in this year's seminar series include finding a
			job in clinical psychology, assessment of young offenders,
			determination of child custody and access, cognitive therapy
			of depression, ethics for psychologists, anxiety disorders,
			assessment using the MMPI, and Rorschach, risk factors for
			mental illness in children, gender identity disturbances in
			children, hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder,
			cultural issues in assessment, child neuropsychology, sexual
			aggression, assessment of sexual arousal through
			phallometric diagnosis, the therapeutic alliance in
			psychotherapy, self-abusive psychiatric patients,
			personality disorders and cognitive behavioural treatment
			for irritable bowel syndrome.</P>
			
			<P><B>Continuing Case Conference</B></P>
			
			<P>This conference provides an opportunity for interns to
			consolidate their psychotherapy skills and to interact with
			members of the Department of Psychology in a mutually
			trusting environment. Three psychology staff members meet on
			a weekly basis with the three interns. They play audiotapes
			of psychotherapy sessions, and listen to tapes of either the
			interns or the psychologists with the goal being to examine
			specific clinical phenomena related to the practice of
			psychotherapy. This case conference serves as a continuing
			forum for the discussion and exploration of personal issues
			relevant to psychotherapy process and outcome as well as
			serving to model for the interns a variety of approaches to
			conceptualization and amelioration of emotional disorders.
			The psychology staff members participating in the case
			conference represent divergent perspectives and provide an
			important atmosphere relevant to disclosure and honest
			discussion of obstacles and successes in therapy.</P>

			research, education, diagnosis and treatment.&quot; Read
			about The Clarke's background in <A HREF="history.html">A
			History of The Clarke</A>.</P>
			
			<P>The Institute operates as a fully-accredited public
			hospital with its own Board of Trustees. Members of the
			Board are appointed by provincial Order-in-Council, with one
			member elected by the medical staff (pursuant to the Public
			Hospitals Act), and two trustees nominated by the Ontario
			Mental Health Foundation. The Institute offers highly
			regarded inpatient and outpatient clinical programs in

			<P>The Clarke has close ties with the University of Toronto.
			The Chairman of the University's Department of Psychiatry is
			also the President and Psychiatrist in Chief of the
			Institute. An agreement with the University recognizes the
			Institute as a fully accredited teaching hospital,
			permitting it to provide undergraduate and graduate medical
			education under the auspices of the faculty of Medicine. The
			Institute trains one quarter of the psychiatrists in Canada
			and half of those in Ontario. Formal training is also
			provided to students in nursing, psychology, social work,
			occupational therapy, pharmacy and child care work. Read

			seven clinical divisions and a research division. The
			clinical divisions are described briefly in this section.
			All our clinical services, clinical research and training of

			research sections, reflecting both basic neuroscience and
			psychosocial approaches to understanding and treating mental
			illnesses.</P>
			
			<P>A relatively unique aspect of The Clarke's organization
			is that professional departments of child care work,
			nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy, psychiatry,
			psychology, social work and speech therapy are maintained
			across the clinical divisions. This results in &quot;matrix
			organizational structure&quot; that allows us to deliver the
			best clinical care in the context of research and
			training.</P>

			<TD><P>Child Care Work is a highly specialized mental health
			profession aimed at the prevention and treatment of mental
			and emotional disorders in children and adolescents. 
			Treatment promotes intellectual, social, emotional, familial
			and general developmental areas of functioning.  While the
			child and adolescent are often the primary focus of Child
			Care Work, assessment and treatment activities are directed
			at the individual in the context of the family and the
			larger social system in which they live.</P>
			
			<P>The Child Care Work Department consists of
			fully-qualified and experienced professional child care
			workers who provide assessment and direct clinical services.
			 Children and families are referred to our department
			through the various multi-disciplinary teams assigned to the
			existing programs and clinics in the Child and Family
			Studies Centre.</P>
			
			<P>Specific treatment services provided by our department
			include: individual, group, play, family, activity and
			milieu therapy using a wide range of traditional and new
			evidence-based treatment approaches.  Other services include
			consultations to both internal and community professionals
			on: gifted children selective mutism management of
			aggressive behaviour child management parenting family
			support day treatment program designs professional team
			functioning critical incident stress debriefing.</P>
			
			<P>The Clarke's commitment to the education of mental health
			professionals is fulfilled in part by our department
			through: the annual training of child care work students
			from Ontario Community Colleges the clinical supervision and
			training of  other mental health professionals participation
			in community agencies college advisory committees direct
			teaching in college courses.</P>
			
			<P>Research activities are an important part of Child Care
			Work.  Many staff participate in on-going research in
			conjunction with other investigators in the Child and Family
			Studies Centre.  These include studies in defiant disorders,
			children at risk for mood disorders, attention deficit
			disorders and selective mutism.</P>

			<TD><P><B>1996 Campaign</B></P>
			
			<P>Each year, The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry
			Foundation holds its &quot;Courage to Come Back&quot;
			campaign under Honourary Co-chairs Paul Molitor and Silken
			Laumann. The campaign honours people throughout Ontario who
			have shown extraordinary courage in their recovery from
			illness, injury or addiction and helped the community.
			Proceeds from the campaign benefit The Clarke Institute of
			Psychiatry.</P>
			
			<P>The &quot;Courage To Come Back&quot; campaign provides
			dignity and recognition to people who have fought back
			against seemingly insurmountable odds and now serve as role
			models for those who are facing similar challenges. It
			allows the community to share in the lives of people who
			have overcome incredible challenges and in the process,
			helps us all appreciate what each of our own lives has to
			offer.</P>
			
			<P>The &quot;Courage&quot; campaign is unique in that it
			presents awards in seven different categories including:
			physical injury, general medical illness, chemical
			dependency, mental illness, youth, seniors and
			celebrity.</P>
			
			<P>The campaign relies totally upon the public who nominate
			friends, family members or colleagues for
			&quot;Courage&quot; awards. (Nominees must be residents of
			Ontario.) Nomination forms are available at all IDA Drug
			Stores and Printing House branches in Ontario or by calling
			The Clarke Foundation at (416) 979-6909. Deadline for
			nominations is October 4th, 1996.</P>
			
			<P>&quot;Courage&quot; awards are presented to seven
			courageous individuals during the awards dinner at the Inn
			on the Park in Toronto on November 21st. Seven hundred
			people including Paul Molitor and Silken Laumann are
			expected to attend.</P>
			
			<P>Tickets to the dinner at $125 are available by calling
			The Clarke Foundation at (416) 979-6909.</P>

			<TD><P>Social workers are assigned to each program or service,
			reflecting the Institute's multi-disciplinary approach to
			health care. While specific responsibilities vary from one
			area to another, in general, social workers are responsible
			for a psychosocial assessment of the patient and his family.
			Ongoing treatment may be provided either to the individual,
			the family, or in a group context. The re-integration of the
			patient in the community is accomplished by post-discharge
			follow-up or referral to an appropriate community

			<P>The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, affiliated with the
			University of Toronto, carries a major responsibility for
			teaching. The Department of Social Work is involved in the
			education of social work students in both the field and
			classroom. As a teaching centre in mental health, the
			Department provides a practicum for a number of students
			specializing in Health. Members of staff are also involved
			in teaching at the Faculty of Social Work, University of
			Toronto.</P>
			
			<P>Social work staff are involved in the ongoing educational
			programs for trainees in other disciplines throughout The
			Clarke and in the wider social work community and mental
			health network. The department's Public Education Program

			<TD><P>At The Clarke, research is conducted across all
			clinical Divisions and takes many forms. Basic science
			research using state-of-the art technologies is aimed at
			learning about the body chemicals, genetic materials, or
			brain structures involved in psychiatric illnesses. Clinical
			research evaluates how specific treatments are working in
			practice. Qualitative methods are used to learn more about
			the subjective experience of clients with mental health
			problems. Community research surveys broad populations to
			provide information about the extent, nature, and severity
			of psychiatric disability, as the basis for providing
			services.</P>
			
			<P>Twelve sections within The Clarke's Research Division
			focus exclusively on research in the following areas:

			<P>The twelve sections are affiliated with the University of
			Toronto's Departments of Psychiatry, Physiology,
			Pharmacology, Psychology, and Institute of Medical Sciences.
			This affiliation creates a rich environment for training at
			the graduate and post-graduate levels. The Research Division
			receives major sponsorship from the Medical Research Council
			of Canada, National Institutes of Health, Natural Sciences
			&amp; Engineering Research Council, Ontario Mental Health
			Foundation, and many other granting bodies. In addition, The

			<TD><P>The Pharmacy Department provides comprehensive drug
			services and assists in promoting safe and appropriate drug
			therapy to all patients of the Institute. The Department
			consists of 5.5 pharmacists and 4.5 pharmacy assistants;
			secretarial support is provided through a part-time
			secretary.</P>
			
			<P>Pharmacists are involved with specific in-patient units
			within the Institute as members of multidisciplinary patient
			care teams. Their role includes evaluating medications
			ordered by physicians, monitoring drug dosage and drug
			interactions, and maintaining drug profiles on each patient.
			This monitoring identifies potential drug-related problems
			and helps in the resolution of issues that may be
			drug-related. The pharmacist attends multidisciplinary
			patient rounds to advise on drug therapy and acts as a
			resource for any drug-related concerns. A medication
			education group is offered weekly on each in-patient unit,
			to educate patients on their psychotropic medication and
			permit discussion of drug-related issues.</P>
			
			<P>The Out-patient Pharmacy evaluates, monitors and
			dispenses medication to eligible patients of the Institute.
			Education is provided on medication through individual
			counselling and provision of information pamphlets on
			specific drugs.</P>
			
			<P>Under the supervision of a pharmacist, pharmacy
			assistants are involved in all the purchasing and
			distributive functions of the Department. They order,
			control, prepare and dispense all medications distributed by
			the Pharmacy to in-patients, utilizing the unit-dose
			distribution system, and to out-patients.</P>
			
			<P>The Pharmacy acts as a resource in all drug-related
			research done at the Institute; pharmacists maintain,
			control and dispense investigational drugs. Audits and
			projects that evaluate the use of specific drugs are
			performed under the direction of the Pharmacy and
			Therapeutics Committee.</P>
			
			<P>Pharmacists provide drug information and education to
			staff, patients, outside professionals and the community
			through direct drug information requests and through the
			publication Pharmacy News, a bi-monthly newsletter that
			reviews current topics in psychotropic drug therapy.
			Pharmacists give presentations to professional and community
			audiences, on request.</P>
			
			<P>Three pharmacists are cross-appointed as tutors in the
			Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto and are
			involved in teaching clinical psychiatry to undergraduate
			students in the final year of the pharmacy program. The
			Pharmacy is a site for the elective rotation in psychiatry
			for postgraduate pharmacy students in the second year of the
			PharmD program at the University. A psychiatry rotation is
			also provided to pharmacists from other institutions, and to
			students from Ontario and from other provinces, on request.
			Students from various Pharmacy Assistant programs in the
			city are offered a training rotation in the Pharmacy.</P>
