<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Economic factors affecting a nations choice to encourage the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel are discussed.  A policy of government support for such a project has been found to greatly enhance the chances of success for an NGV program, as can
be seen in New Zealand.  The major factors affecting an NGV program's success are vehicle performance, and having a sufficient number of refuelling stations to enable drivers the freedom of movement they have with gasoline powered vehicles

This study models the economic effects of using alternate fuels in the Army Directorate of Engineering and Housing fleet of light trucks.  A background investigation identified current government and industry use of CNG and LNG/propane.  Using this invest
igation, an economic model was proposed which included:  refueling station costs, vehicle conversion costs, fuel costs, and changes in operation and maintenance costs.  (author abstract

The author suggests the safety aspects of NGV's has not been adequately promoted.  He feels there is an opportunity to focus on the issue, and to link it with the environmental issue, to accelerate the acceptance of NGV's. Lack of data, and outdated data
are a problem; it is recommended new data be compiled.  It is also suggested that the implementation of safet regulations needs to be unified and simplified.  More use of quantified risk assessment modelling might be used to improve the standardization pr
ocess currently in place

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is using flexible-fuel vehicle (FFV), designed to operate on any combination of 15-100% gasoline and the rest methanol fuel, to obtain emissions data at 21%, 23% and 25% oxygen levels in the combustion air.  Emissions dat
a are collected by following the federal test procedure (FTP) cycle and employing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) recommended "off-cycle" test (EPA REP05).  Data collected include complete hydrocarbon speciation and "second-by-second" c
oncentrations of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted in the exhaust.  With indolene fuel, baseline data suggest that oxygen-enrichment dramatically reduces overall FTP emissions of HC, CO, and air toxics, but increase
s emissions of NOx.  However, during the first 25 s of the cold-phase, both CO and HC emissions are reduced without any increase in NOx emissions.  Potential application of this technology is to use an oxygen-enriching membrane for the first 30 to 60 seco
nds of cold-start.

Australian Gas Utilities have made a strategic decision to develop a new market for natural gas as a transport fuel, NGV.  This decision has been made against the background of declining national oil self-sufficiency and therefore, good government support
for the use of indigenous fuels as a replacment for increasing oil imports.  The short term NGV target market, in Victoria, has been identified as the replacement of ADO in road transport and immediately in depot based applications.  The major specific b
arriers to the short term market development have been identified: infrastructure, economics, technology, and attitudes.  The strategies implemented to overcome these form the basis of this paper (Author abstract Includes brief author biography 2 refs

Theoretical limits of performance and economy of methanol, ethanol, benzene, iso-octane, ethane and methane in the ideal Otto cycle, spark-ignition engine were determined.  The ideal Otto cycle used represents the theoretical limits of efficiency and perf
ormance for a fast-burn adiabatic engine.  The results indicated that less than two per cent variations in thermodynamic cycle efficiency exist among the various fuels.  The thermodynamic properties of th fuel/air mixtures themselves accounted for these v
ariations

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A mathematical model is presented to simulate the evolution with time of a spark channel into a combustion wave.  The model considers the phenomena associated with electrical breakdown and arc phases, the plasma conductivity and realistic transport coeffi
cients at high temperatures, and a detailed chemical reaction scheme.  The growth of the initial flame radius is calculated by a numerical integration of the model equations and compared with the experimental observation of Tagalian and Heywood.  The time
needed for the establishment of a flame propagation in the "like- laminar" regime was found to be strongly dependent on the breakdown energy and on the spark duration, and to a small extent on the initial pressure temperature, and residual gas fraction.
The model was used also to examine quantitatively the effect of some relevant parameters on the cycle-to-cycle variation in the steady-state burning velocity and it was concluded that the cycle-to-cycle variation is attributed mainly either to the inhomo
geneity of the trapped mixture and/or to the cycle-to-cycle variation in trapped conditions; a variation of 5% of the volumetric efficiency affects the burning velocity by some plus or minus 13%.  (Author abstract

ty it should be understood no new technology has ever been successfully moved into the marketplace without favorable economics to all the participating parties.  An overview of the economics, engine conversion, fuel storage and supply system as well as so
me of the experience to date is put forth in this paper. (Author Abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

At present, Quebec's major source of energy is hydroelectric power which can be an important instrument for economic development. It is a challenge to use this resource to achieve the maximum in economic multiplier effects. Among the possible options are
those which encourage the development of industries which are large consumers of electricity and which are generally situated at the early stages of the economic cycle. Within this context, hydrogen is expected to play an ever-increasing proportion in the
liquid form. Both its production and its liquefication require large amounts of energy and processes exist whereby these operations can be carried out using electricity. It is thus appropriate that analysis should be directed to evaluation of the competi
tivity of a liquid hydrogen production plant in Quebec. This evaluation examined the possibility of deriving economic benefit for Quebec from its hydroelectric resources from (i) state-of-art technology for production, storage and distribution of liquid h
ydrogen. (ii) New-generation water electrolysis technology for large-scale production of hydrogen (in contrast to the current practice of reforming natural gas).

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

At present approximately 1,700 EVs have been put to use in Japan, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has a plan to have 200,000 EVs be deployed by 2000.  As for infrastructure for charging, as of March 1994, quick charging stands
have been installed at 38 locations, and 15 of which make use of daytime power for charging, while remainning 23 make use of nightime power for charging storage batteries and then use the charged power for daytime charging.  There is a plan, by year 2000,
of establishing fueling stands for low-emission type vehicles under the Eco Station 2000 Project of MITI at 2,000 locations.  Of these, about one half is expected to be dedicated for EV use.The electric utilities, from the standpoint of power supplie
rs, have been jointly investigating the impacts of EV charging to the power supply systems, in particular, on the following topics:  -Forecast and comparison of impacts of various charging systems to the power load curve;  -Forecast and comparison  of imp
acts of higher harmonics generated in various types of chargers to the power supply systems.  In this paper, we will report the study of impacts of various charging systems to the power load curve.

The economic feasibility of cogeneration depends on a number of parameters beyond just fuel and electric power cost, including first cost, maintenance cost, electric and overall efficiency, and site load factor.  Many of these parameters are solely or sub
stantially dependent on the characeteristics of the engine employed.  Although combustion turbines are frequently the engine of choice for industrial cogeneration, the rapidly developing market for cogeneration in commercial sector applications is largely
being met by spark-ignited, reciprocating gas engines due to the higher efficiency and lower cost of these engines in the 1 kW to 2000 kW size range.  This paper discusses desired features of gas engines for cogeneration and their relative importance, an

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This study was undertaken in an attempt to produce a composite absorbent material which would have good adsorption properties and also be resistant to mechanical abrasion from constant vibration.  In a previous study Amoco GX-33, a carbon, was found to ha
ve a significantly higher absorbency rate for methane over other absorbents tested.  The Amoco GX- and PX-series are not however, in their present form, suitable for use as absorbents in moving vehicles.  Tests are performed to examine combining the Amoco
superactivated carbon with a polymer derived carbon to possibly produce a material with the needed properties.  Conclusions indicate that composite carbons can be made with Amoco GX-32 and polyvinylidene chloride carbon or polyvinylidene fluoride carbon.
Further improvements on storage densities for methane are thought likely and possibilities are suggested

Development results show that U.S. 1994 emissions standards can be comfortably met without the use of electronic air-fuel ratio control or an oxidation catalyst.  Transient cycle emissions of 1.7 g/bhph NOx + NMH have been obtained from de-rated engines t
o be use in field demonstration vehicles.  Electronic control will allow 2.5 g/bhph NOx + NMHC to be achieved without de-rating.  Further emissions reductions without after-treatment will depend on after-cooling, which also offers the potential for an inc
reased rating. (Authors' abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The U.S. transportation system is currently experiencing the early stages of a historically common, but very difficult, predicament.  As in the past, the U.S. depends excessively on a single transportation fuel whose domestic reserves are being exhausted.
Previously, abrupt and unmanaged transitions from animal power to wood, from wood to coal, and from coal to petroleum have caused steep declines in the sales of the old technology, which have contributed causally to U.S. depressions.  A transition from
petroleum to an alternative fuel must come about soon.  Currently, there are few immediate economic substitutes for the oil-based fuels now used by U.S. vehicles.  If alternative fuels are not developed, this situation -- which is exacerbated by projected
increases in the gap between domestic production and consumption of oil -- will lead to severe economic problems that could threaten our national security.  (Author Abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A numerical optimization technique has been applied in order to obtain the optimum level of some design variables of the diesel fuel injection nozzle. A description of the optimization procedure is provided together with a discussion of the physical and m
athematical flow model used.  Sample applications of the optimization procedure addressing design of a fuel injection nozzle consideration along with comparisons among three different fuels are presented The analysis indicated the possibility of significa
nt reduction in the diameter of the injection cavity and the diameter of the injection orifices.  It was evident that the physical properties of fuels have significant influence on the selected design variables.  The necessary changes in design of the inj
ection nozzle are recommended before long term operation on the fuels with different physical properties.  (From author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Esso Petroleum Canada (EPC) has successfully road tested an LPG conversion system developed by TNO Research Institue.  In this system, LPG vapour is introduced into the intake air manifold just before the turbocharger.  The gas supply is controlled by the
engine speed and load.  The TNO conversion kts were installed on two trucks, one adjusted for 40% by volume (vol) propane and the second for 20% vol propane.  The two trucks were operated out of EPC's marketing terminal in Sarnia from May, 1983 to April,
1985 along with a similar truck as a reference vehicle.  Fuel economy data from the test indicate essentially no difference between diesel fuel and dual-fuel operaton on a total energy basis.  Engine durability is reduced with LPG but at 20% vol propane,
the effect is minimal.  For higher levels of LPG substitution, improvements may be necessary to valve and upper cylinder metallurgy.  This paper also describes the bench test development of a CNG/diesel conversion kit using a similar approach.  (From aut

In order to reduce the diesel idle knock, the effects of EGR on the idling characteristics were investigated on a passenger car equipped with an EGR Idle Knock Reduction System developed for practical use It was found that EGR was effective not only for r
educing idle knock but also for exhaust emissions and engine vibration Moreover, the practical range and possibility of the EGR Idle Knock Reduction System were found by clarifying the relationship between EGR, injection timing, cooling water temperature,
noise level and fuel consumption

Although the use of liquefied natural gas as a vehicular fuel has many merits, there are also certain problems associated with its use.  This paper discusses a primary problem, the distribution and vehicular storage of the fuel.  In an effort to explore t
he combined effects of various heat leakage rates and fuel use rates on fuel tank temperature and pressure, a simple thermodynamic analysis was made of the tank.  Results indicate there are sufficient thermodynamic bases to seriously consider the use of L
NG, particularly as a fuel for long range commercial vehicles

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Two induction motor (IM) control concepts will be presented: a concept based on DC link current measurement only (voltage control scheme) and a sophisticated current control scheme.  The first one is aimed for smaller low cost drives.  The control algorit
hm is relatively simple and can be implemented with inexpensive microntrollers.  The second one is based on a discretized current controller.  Motor torque is directly proportional to its current and therefore a very good current control is preferable.  R
equirements of the vehicle drive controllers are different from other drive control requiements.  Smooth acceleration is as important as very good speed reference following for the conventional drives.  Some other important control and protection function
s will also be presented.  Several prototypes have been built and tested in various electric vehicles.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In February 1991 a report on the "Current Status of Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Development and Deployment in Japan" by the Executive Director was forwarded to members of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA). Through its affiliation in
the World Electric Vehicle Association (WEVA), EVAA continues to exchange information with the Japan Electric Vehicle Association (JEVA). In addition, there has been the exchange of information with visitors from Japan to the EVAA Washington, D.C. office
by representatives of the Institute of Applied Energy, Honda, Toyota, and Nissan. A number of publications of the current and future electric vehicle activities by these organizations were presented to the Executive Director during these visits. In ad
dition, the recent publications by the Japan Electric Vehicle Association in connection with the 1991 Tokyo Motor Show from October 26 to November 8, 1991 have been received. JEVA has also provided the latest "Outlines of the EV Extension Program" prepare
d by the EV Coucil of Japan for the Machinery and Information Division, Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).This report will be a compilation and summary of the latest information from these sources as well as Press Releases and newspa
per articles on the Japanese electric and hybrid vehicle activities since the February 1991 EVAA Report.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A probabilistic risk assessment was conducted to estimate the risk of accidental ignition (and subsequent fire/explosion) from indoor refueling and servicing of CNG fueled mass transit buses.  Five scenarios were considered.  Risks associated with each sc
enario for the refueling equipment, bus system, refueling/servicing facility and refueling process were evaluated using event and fault tree analysis.  The study considered the initiating events to be gas leakage and the presence of ignition sources, resu
lting in ignition.  Using component reliability data, the probability of incident was estimated.  A publicly available database of safety-related information on NGVs was developed to support the assessment. The results using U.S. data suggest a probabilit
y of incident per refueling between 3.27E-9 and 6.87E-9.  The variation depends on certain characteristics of the refueling/servicing station, the refueling mode, and other factors.  (author abstract

This is the second interim report on tests done on a commercial natural gas vehicle (NGV) fleet located in Kamloops, B.C.  Vehicles tested were only those previously chosen for the test, though an increasing number of commercial and private vehicles are u
sing the test refueling station.  Problems monitored on the compression equipment of the fueling station, as well as sales and marketing information are presented.  A major part of the report involves data completed by drivers of the vehicles on a "Perfor
manc Test Log", and dynamometer testing done by Cariboo College and B.C. Research.  Also included is a section on attitudes and safety concerns of drivers of converted vehicles

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The thermal efficiency that could occur in the future for a variety of automotive engine candidates operating on conventional and alternate fuels is projected based on current automotive engine development trends and the special characteristics of the var
ious alternate fuels.  The multi-fuel engine candidates include mixture cycle and direct injection reciprocating engines, as well as adiabatic turbocompound engines and advanced gas turbine and Stirling engines.  The alternate fuels considered are propane
, methanol, ethanol, diesel and methane

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Interest in permanent magnet motor drive systems for electric vehicles has continued due to the high efficiency and power density associated with this class of motors.  Resources at Unique Mobility have been devoted to designing the characteristics of the
se motors to be well suited for electric vehicle applications.  The desired characteristics for a vehicle drive system include light weight, use of a single-speed transmission, capability of achieving a wide speed range, and a constant power profile from
mid to high speed with suitable acceleration torque at lower speeds.  Conventional permanent magnet motor technology is not well suited for meeting all of these characteristics; the constant power profile in particular.  Permanent magnet motors are tradit
ionally  considered to be constant torque devices due to the presence of the permanent magnets as the fixed-amplitude magnetic field source.  In order to achieve the desired constant power profile, electronic phase advance is employed.  While phase advanc
e is typically described in terms of field weakening, it can also have a different effect on the motor depending upon the system configuration.  This additional effect is described as "impedance-based".  In order to determine which of these two effects is
present and which to design for, certain motor parameters and the control scheme must be evaluated.  When a select combination of system choices are made, a potentially inexpensive vehicle drive system which is well suited for an automotive environment c
an be achieved.

There is growing interest in using natural gas in vehicles in the U.S. and worldwide.  Factors driving this development include desire for domestic energy use and diversification, reduced emissions, and fuel cost savings.  As an engine and vehicle fuel, n
atural gas has many favorable characteristics as well as attributes that present technical and market challenges.  A primary element of addressing these challenges is understanding the chemical and physical properties of natural gas and knowledge of the p
ossible ramifications associated with gas composition variations.  (author abstract)  This is the fifth paper in "Gaseous Fuels for Engines"

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Discussion is made of some of the main performance features of diesel engines operating on gaseous fuels as dual fuel engines.  It is shown that the energy release rate of such engines can be viewed to be made up of three separate components.  Such a view
may be helpful in predicting such diagrams and hence pressure development and power output.  Then, by considering the chemical kinetics of the reaction of the gaseous fuel in air and accounting for the contribution of the diesel pilot, the knock limited
power output of a dual fuel engine can be predicted (Author abstract

This report provides information on the environmental, health and safety effects of transportation fuels used in the Canadian highway transportation system. The report focuses on the experience in Canada and the United States, and on recent developments i
n environmental legislation and technology.The health effects of air and water pollution are well documented. Many of the world's major urban centres experience moderate to extremely poor air quality. Recognizing the public's desire for improved air qua
lity, natural and local government in several countries are pressing producers of fuel and automobile manufacturers to develop cleaner alternatives to current gasoline and diesel-fuelled vehicles. These efforts have stimulated the development of vehicle e
missions regulations and have produced notable advances in emission control technology applied in both the United States and Canada.Current model automobiles, for example, emit only 5 - 10 % of the air pollutants emitted by their predecessors of 20 year
s ago in the precontrol era. Although the use of lead in gasoline has been phased out in Canada, refiners have met the octane demand and maintained the quality of their gasolines by making substantial changes in the way fuel is produced. Canada is now pre
paring a new level of vehicle emission controls to ensure that new vehicles in this country meet the same technology-forcing emission standards as those that will apply in the U.S. with the implementation of standards set there by the Clean Air Act Amendm
ents of 1990 and by California. In addition to these advances, Canada has been in the forefront of the alternative transportation fuel (ATF) field with incentive programs that have developed a market for 140000 propane and 32000 or so natural gas vehicles
(NGVs). Canada is also establishing markets for methanol and ethanol-fuelled vehicles. The major potential for alternative fuel vehicles (ATVs) now lies in their ability to provide lower tailpipe and evaporative emissions than may be achievable by reform
ulation of gasoline or changes in the chemistry of diesel fuel. This report examines the latest emission control technologies and air quality legislation for fuels and vehicles.Another area of concern for future and current policy debate is the global i
mpact of further increase in ambient global temperatures as a result of increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases generated by combustion of fossil fuels. The potential for slowing the global warming trend by use of ATFs
is examined. The report also examines the fuel exposure health risk and fire risk of the major contending ATFs--NGV, propane, methanol and ethanol -- compared to gasoline. (author summary)Limited availability contact Kelly Darby of Gas Technology Ca

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper presents results of a study investigating the burning rates in diesel engines and the factors affecting rate-control.  The burning rate of fuel is important in all reciprocating engines because it controls directly the cycle efficiency, the noi
se emitted from the engine and the peak pressure to which the engine components are subjected.  It was found that major factors affecting burning rate were injection rate, engine speed and combustion chamber design, all of which directly affect mixing

The GM/D.O.E. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell Development Program is specifically structured to develop a methanol reformer type system capable of generating 30 kW. This program is being done in concert with the Partnership for New Generation of
Vehicles (PNGV) and the Clean Car Initiative.  The PEM Technology is considered to be the closest to a manufacturable product by the major Auto makers of the world.  As with all new technologies, the PEM Fuel Cell Program is not without its development is
sues.  These development issues are what the GM Phase 2 program will be addressing.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper describes the engine performance and exhaust emissions of an engine development for CNG use based upon a HONDA Accord gasoline engine. A compression ratio is raised to 12.5 to increase a power output and fuel economy of CNG dedicated engine. Th
e engine output power is substantially the same as the output power of the gasoline engine. High pressure of natural gas from a tank is reduced 2 stages through a primary regulator and a secondary regulator. Such pressure reduced CNG is then injected into
intake ports through multi point injectors developed by HONDA. Fuel injection is controlled by ECU with high accuracy. Exhaust gas emissions are reduced by the three way catalyst and no EGR is applied. The catalyst is developed for CNG use.

This paper, presented at the 1991 Windsor Workshop on Alternative Fuels (Toronto, Ontario; June 24-26, 1991), contains materials for overhead projection and discussion notes associated with them on the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments which were signed into
law on November 15, 1990.  Among the provisions of the act is a requirement that standards be established for fuels as well natural gas vehicles.  The Clean Air Act removes barriers to development that had been established by regulatory agencies.   An ove
rview of the current situation and new developments that are likely in the future are discussed

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Natural gas, due to its abundance in certain parts of the world, is being used as a fuel for motor vehicles.  The advantages of using natural gas (methane) as a motor fuel is summarized in reference 1.  One of the disadvantages, however, with using natura
l gas in conventional spark ignited internal combustion engines is the reduction in power caused by the methane's slow burning velocity.  In an attempt to solve this problem work was done to study the influence of ignition on the laminar burning character
istics of methane in a bomb under low pressures (around 1 atm).  The objective was to see if the combustion duration of a stoichiometric methane-air mixture could be reduced by using a more efficient ignition source.  The results showed the combustion dur
ation could be shortened when the "proper" ignition source was used.  The "proper" ignition source was one that had a long arc and high power electrical discharge.  This combination decreased the ignition delay significantly, and hence, reduce the overall
combustion time.  The present research goal is to install these ignition systems on a 4 cylinder engine to determine what effects they have on the engine.  Can the "proper" ignition system improve the performance of methane-fuelled engines

The 1990's appear to be the decade in which the long-sought dream of practical, economical electric vehicles will begin to be realized.  As the first commercial vehicles hit the road in niche markets, and as designs for more-advanced vehicles take shape o
n design boards, the major U.S. automakers have agreed to unprecedented cooperation in bringing advanced EV batteries to commercial development through the recently formed U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium.  (from author abstract

The possibility of using waste heat generated by the traction batteries inside a hybrid or electric vehicle to provide heating to the cab area of the vehicle has been studied.Various charge and discharge tests were performed on a lead acid Genesis G12V3
8Ah10VP battery module manufactured by Hawker Energy Inc.. The temperature on the surface of the battery was monitored during testing. For a 5A charge rate, it was found that the surface of the battery was monitored during testing. For a 30 A discharge ra
te, it was found that the average temperature rose a maximum of 5_C; while, for a 30A discharge rate, if was found that the average temperature rose a maximum of 4_C. This is consistent with expected results based on thermal data published by Hawker Energ
y. In general, very little difference was noted between the temperatures on the top, bottom sides, or ends of the module (<4_C for all tests).

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The focus of this project is address specific issues related to compressed natural gas (NGV) vehicle fueling. One component of the CNG fueling station that needs further development is the CNG dispenser. The specific areas where improvements in the existi
ng dispensers are desired include: reducing the dispenser cost, improving the dispensed gas flow measurement accuracy,reducing the time required to fill the vehicle, and maximizing the level of fill provided by the dispenser control system. This document
summarizes the efforts to establish reasonable development goals for each of these topics.In order to determine development goals for CNG dispensers, a review of the technical literature on CNG dispensing was performed and ten CNG dispenser manufactur
ers were interviewed. The review efforts focused on determining the performance of the present generation of CNG dispensers with respect to fill time, fill level, and measurement accuracy. The cost of CNG dispensers was determined. In addition, the perfor
mance of gasoline dispensers was investigated to provide a comparison with CNG dispensers. (author summary)

This study is an update of a previous report (CNG 0479) which assessed the production capability, for conventional and supplemental sources, of gas energy to the year 2000.  There has been a downward revision of earlier estimates as a result of changes oc
curring in the national energy focus.  There is currently a focus on relying on conventional natural gas and oil supplies, and a decline in projections of future energy demand due to increasing conservation and more efficient energy utilization.  A supply
capability forecast was performed which included two major elements:  lower-48 state natural gas production, and other sources of gas supply.  The major conclusions of the study indicate that a very positive potential  for gas supply exists over the next
20 years

If NGV is to be promoted successfully for fleet operations, comprehensive information on the performance and economics of existing fleets using natural gas must be available to prospective customers.  Detailed information is required for both dual-fuel an
d spark ignition conversions; the availability of such information is very limited.  In this paper some technical aspects of spark ignition and dual-fuel conversion options are described.  A simple economic analysis of a bus and a haulage operation is the
n undertaken, a panel to be set up to undertake the collection of information on a collaborative basis (Author abstract

Report on the propane conversion program undertaken in 1982 by the Petal Municipal Separate School District in Forrest County, Mississippi. At th start of the program the decision was made to convert only the newer buse but based on their experiences they
have said they would not hesitate t install propane carburetion equipment on an older engine.  Of the 24 buses in the fleet, 13 operate on propane.  The program was considered very successful and Petal Separate were able to completely pay off their loan
after only two years because of their savings in fuel and maintenance costs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of LNG as a vehicle fuel, to determine market niches, and to identify needed technology improvements.  This white paper is being issued when the work is approximately 30 percent complete to preview
the study direction, draw preliminary conclusions, and make initial recommendations.  Interim findings relative to LNG vehicle technology, economics and safety are presented.  It is important to decide if heavier hydrocarbons should be allowed in LNG vehi
cle fuel.  Development of suitable refueling couplings and vehicle fuel supply pressure systems are recommended.  Initial economics analyses considered transit buses and pickup and delivery trucks fueled via onsite liquefiers and imported LNG.  Net user c
osts were more than (but in some cases, close to) those for diesel fuel and gasoline.  Lowering the cost of small-scale liquefiers would significantly improve the economics of LNG vehicles.  New emissions regulations may introduce considerations beyond si
mple cost comparisons.  LNG vehicle safety and available accident data are reviewed.  Consistent codes for LNG vehicles and refueling facilities are needed.  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper deals with the outlook for conventional automotive engines in the face of continuing competition from a variety of alternative powerplants. The primary areas considered are technological attributes, entry barriers, and cost.  A brief review of
the technological improvements of the recent past is presented and the overall results in powerplant attributes are reviewed, together with forecasts for the immediate future. The specific entry barriers presented by capital investment, the current infras
tructure and public acceptance are also discussed.  Finally, a breakdown of typical costs of todays conventional engine is presented.  Promising development which may support the projected future improvements are briefly summarized (From Author Abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

With more and more fleet vehicles being converted to compressed natural gas operation, concerns have arisen about the safety of their fuel systems and the need for regulations to ensure safe operation.  The potential for widespread operation of vehicles u
sing compressed natural gas adds urgency to these concerns Most of the safety concerns revolve around the high-pressure storage and fuel lines present in existing systems.  Specific items in question are:  the need for high-pressure automatic fuel cutoff
switches, vehicle disablement during refueling, the need for methane sensors, cylinder specifications and venting requirements, location of refueling points, and system crash-worthiness.  This paper examines these concerns.

Arias Research Associates (ARA) has been developing a new, extremely high-powered electric vehicle (EV) battery called the Sealed Bipolar Lead-Acid (SBLA).  The technology was originally demonstrated at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the "S
tar Wars" program.  After five years of development, the battery is through the laboratory stage and independent laboratory testing, and full-size EV batteries are being fabricated with sponsorship from the Exide Corporation.  Compared to conventional lea
d-acid technology, the laboratory results and vehicle test simulations demonstrate dramatic advances in power, energy, and life, which rival the performance of "advanced" battery technologies.  The importance of a low-cost, high-power battery to the succe
ssful commercialization of EVs is quantified and discussed.

Roadable vehicles using natural gas as a fuel are now common in some countries and being tried in others on an experimental basis.  In some countries compressed gas in the fuel tanks of vehicles is perceived as an extra hazard and liquefied natural gas in
bulk has been banned from some communities.  It is conceivable then, that if the gas were immobilized in some way, such as adsorption on a solid or dissolution in a liquid, greater safety would be perceived and, in the case of solution in a liquid, an ac
tual increase in safety would result.  That is, if all but the filling tube were filled with the solution, a tank rupture from whatever cause would produce a frothing liquid rather than a gas expanding with a velocity perhaps about the speed of sound Besi
des the safety feature, it seemed possible from previous experiments and from calculations, that it should be possible to dissolve more natural gas in a suitable hydrocarbon liquid filled tank than could be contained in the empty (empty of liquid) tank at
the same temperature and pressure (From author introduction Includes brief author biography

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Some of the characteristics of biogas as a fuel for internal combustion (IC) engines were studied.  The objectives were to determine a) the compression ratio at which an engine operates most efficiently while usin methane as a fuel, b) the effects of carb
on dioxide dilution of methane o the performance of the engine through the operational range of air/fuel ratios, and c) the limits of flammability of methane-carbon dioxide mixtures and air as the IC engine fuel.  The results indicate that for the biogas
operated IC engine the best performance was obtained at compression ratios ranging from 11.1 to 16.1.  The specific power output peaked at a compression ratio of 15.1 which is the ratio recommended.  In addition, the results indicate a significant decreas
e in engine efficiency and range of flammability of the ga as carbon dioxide dilution is increased

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Gaseous fuels (natural gas, synthetic natural gas and LP-Gases) used in transportation vehicles are assessed.  The fuels' physical properties require larger storage volumes than liquid fuels, posing unique environmental and safety problems.  Gaseous fuels
provide a significant portion of the U.S. energy supply but increased uses will probably increase imports; production resources will not prevent imports due to increased demand.  Gaseous fuels can allow increased efficiency of spark-ignition Otto Cycle i
nternal combustion engines during warmup at the expense of reduced specific power output.  Heat methanol allows increased fuel efficiency and specific power output and is easier to incorporate into a transportation vehicle.  Gaseous fuels are best suited
to stationary combustion systems served by pipelines.  Liquid fuels are better suited to use in transportation; alternative liquid fuels should be developed with transportation use in mind

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Scandinavian countries are about to start their way into using natural gas as a vehicle fuel.  There are large resources available in the area which makes NG useful.  The high public request for clean air in Sweden and the Scandinavian countries gives
NG a unique possibility to prove itself, being the best alternative to the standard fuels and other alternative fuels.  Technical and financial prestudies have been done and some hardware projects have taken place.  Both types of studies indicate a good
potential and a possibility of reaching what has been defined as 'significantly reduced exhaust emission levels' and an economy as good as for diesel fuel heavy vehicles over ten years.  Three projects have been carried out in Denmark, one is to be carrie
d out in Finland, and a report has been writte in Sweden that might be accepted as the Nordic/Scandinavian project.  This report presents ways to fulfill the above mentioned requests. (Author Abstract)

Southern California Edison Company (SCE) is developing practical tools for forecasting and assessing the load impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on electric utility destribution systems.  The project utilizes a micro-simulation based vehicle penetration fo
recasting system for household and fleet vehicles.  The forecasting model, designed for California, includes alternative fuel vehicles and is based on pre-specified attributes of future vehicles, producing annual forecasts of new and used alternative fuel
vehicle penetration.  The system also forecasts of annual vehicle miles traveled for all vehicles and charging demand for EVs.  This forecasting model will be incorporated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) based simulation and planning tool that
will identify and display the spatial distribution of forecasted electrical load on the SCE system.  Enhancements to the GIS model may include tools to evaluate EV charging equipment impact (from generated harmonics and inherent power factor) on utility-
system power quality.  In the past, utility load-forecasting methods have incorporated aggregate modeling of a service territory to estimate demand for use in electrical distribution planning.  The GIS application now being developed will enable utility e
ngineers and planners to view EV spatial distribution and load estimates at regional substation, and circuit levels.  Sensitivity to EV and charger characteristics, electric rate options, pricing incentives, etc. , can be fed into the simulation model to
determine what impact they might have on the load forecasts.

The possibility of using vegetable oils as a substitute, replacement or extender for hydrocarbon fuels used in compression ignition engines has interested researchers for years.  In this study, which is Canadian based, the oils being studied come from rap
eseed and canola.  The first part of the study involved a literature review, fuel analysis and economic study and preliminary engine testing.  The second part involved more exhaustive engines testing to study factors such as combustion chamber deposits, l
ubricating oil deterioration and exhaust emissions.  Overall, the oils tested were not found to be particularly satisfactory as automotive fuels

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The objective of this work is to develop a modern fast burn low emission spark ignited engine for cogeneration application below 500kW.  The basis for the work is a previously developed larger engine that was used as the prototype for scaling.  For cogene
ration application certain enhancements were required beyond the original prototype and these were included in th scaled design.  To minimize the amount of laboratory testing in the program, maximum use of the existing prototype databse knowledge was inco
rporated in the analysis and simulation work carried out in the concept and preliminary design phases.  To achieve the desired optimization, the methods of Taguchi were used in both the preliminary design work and the full scale laboratory experimentation

This seminar was held to address concerns and complaints, as well as distribute updated information, in regards to the Federal Propane Vehicle Program.  The major problems with propane in particular were found to be the lack of sufficient propane distribu
tion points, safety of the fuel, difficulties in obtaining program funds and the feeling that regional managers were lacking sufficient knowledge of the program.  Other discussions involved new provincial regulations, training and certification of mechani
cs, certification and enforcement of installations, operating problems and mechanisms to improve the present program.  It was determined that a series of seminars should be held targetting regional managers responsible for fleet decision making in an effo
rt to awaken them to the advantages of propane and CNG vehicles

This report summarizes the results of a written survey of fueling station engineers at natural gas companies nationwide.  The survey is designed to isolate problematic components in order to make recommendations for the improved performance and reduced co
st of fueling stations.  The components are assessed as a part of fourteen major items.  The ratings range fro 4.2 to 2.9 on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 meaning "very problematic" and  meaning "virtually trouble-free".  The most trouble-free ratings were gi
ven to : drive systems, storage facilities and temperature compensation.  The lowest, most troublesome ratings were given to ancillary, card-lock, and sequential/priority systems.

The Toyota lean combustion system methanol is a lean burn methanol combustion system designed to maximize fuel economy and driving performance while minimizing pollutant emissions.  Testing at the EPA Motor Vehicle Emissions Laboratory indicates that this
system allows relatively low emissions of regulated pollutants and aldehydes when operated on either M100 or M85 methanol fuels under transient driving and evaporative emissions test conditions.  Total vehicle hydrocarbon emissions appear lower when the
vehicle is operated on M100 rather than M85 fuel.  Fuel economy is slightly improved when the system is operated on M85 rather than M100 fuel.  (Author Abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The concept of using alcohol fuel as alternatives to diesel fuel in diesel engines is a recent one.  The scarcity of transportation petroleum fuels which developed in the early 1970's spurred many efforts to find alternatives.  Alcohols were quickly recog
nized as prime candidates to displace or replace high octane petroleum fuels.  However, alternatives to the large demand for diesel fuel in many countries were not as evident.  Innovative thinking led to various techniques by which alcohol fuels can parti
ally or completely displace diesel fuel in diesel transportation vehicles The methods of using alcohol fuels in diesel engines (in order of increasing diesel fuel displacement) include solutions, emulsions, fumigation, dual injection, spark ignition, and
ignition improvers.  Power output, thermal efficiency and exhaust emissions can change significantly depending on the techniques employed.  Reliability and durability still need to be demonstrated for most of these techniques Work in the future will deter
mine which of these techniques are best.  Testing will evolve to include more on-road, in-use type tests.  Additional techniques such as "hot-spot" ignition will be researched

The rapid price increases for crude petroleum and its derivatives in the 1970s have had a major direct impact on industrialized countries through the price of motor fuels.  These fuels usually represent a very large portion of total energy demand and thei
r cost has become a significant fraction of household expenditures.  The responses of vehicle owners to such changes can take many forms, including reduced automobile usage, purchase of more energy efficient vehicles, and the substitution of less expensiv
e fuels for gasoline.  Some of these responses have been studied by other authors.  In this paper, the analysis will focus on some of the possibilities for inter-fuel substitution

To assist the NGV industry in understanding the actual variation in dispenser meter performance characteristics the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) has constructed a multi-purpose meter testing facility capable of testing metering technologies for high
flow rate (up to 48 Nm3/min ) and high pressure (20 Mpa) applications. This paper provides a description of the meter test setup and procedure as well as test results using Micro Motion Coriolis flow meters (Model DH025S and DH038S).

Until recently, there have been relatively wide applications of the induction motor to the electric vehicle among various motors.  The permanent magnet motor, featuring high efficiency and high output power density, has sometimes been used.  Considering t
hese desirable features, more attention should be paid to its potential.  In order to achieve high efficiency and high output power density, the flux density of each of the magnetic substances inside the motor must be increased.  High flux density causes
a higher possibility of magnetostriction.  Consequently, the stator teeth vibrate, which in turn leads to motor vibration.  The focus of this report is the vibration at the stator teeth and investigated the root causes of vibration, such as magnetostricti
on, through the use of magnetic field analysis.  Furthermore, based on the results of this analysis, a vibration analysis was performed (a combined analysis which couples both magnetic field analysis and vibration analysis).

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Gas turbines are able to burn fuels of low calorific value (produced by gasification of coal or heavy fuel oils) as well as fuels of high calorific value (mineral oil or natural gas).  This article discusses the thermal efficiency with two typical layouts
(atmospheric and pressure gasification) and describes the necessary modifications of certain components of the gas turbine

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of natural gas in Canada has doubled in the last twenty years.  As the search continues for replacements for petroleum based fuels within Canada, natural gas comes to the forefront.  This is in part because of large reserves of the fuel available
within the country.  As well as conventional reservoirs of gas there is a growing interest in the potential of unconventional sources such as shale, coal and peat gasification, hydrates, and others.  The fact that there is a sufficient supply of natural g
as at hand has led to new marketing areas opening up.  Natural gas can be used as utility and industrial boiler fuels, in cogeneration and transportation.  In addition to being abundant natural gas is a clean safe fuel which can be used in many sectors of
the economy.  A move to replace oil with natural gas could make Canada self-sufficient in energy

This paper, presented at the conference on Commercializing Clean Fuels for Transportation (April 12-14, 1992, Ottawa, Ontario), reviews possible resources for natural gas.  Proven world reserves have been increasing steadily.  Most current proven resource
s are in conventional sandstone or carbonate reservoirs but there is potential for recoverable reserves from unconventional sources, such as tight formations and coal seams.  Fourteen figures containing statistics on natural gas resources and related subj
ects are included.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Recent United States regulatory standards will require the reduction of emissions in new heavy-duty vehicles in 1988 and 1991.  In the meantime, existing vehicles will also have to lower their emissions levels.  Five promising methods are diesel fuel modi
fications (reducing sulfur and aromatics), trap-oxidizers (which are expensive but efficient), methanol engines (which have low emissions and resist self-ignition), particle agglomerators (these do not change the mass emissions rate but change the particu
late material into a less noxious form) and LPG fumigation (which reduces visible smoke emissions but may not have as much effect on particulate emissions)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The air pollution in Mexico City has reached dangerous levels, so experimental research was carried on for the preliminary reduction of smoke emission in operating buses of the urban transportation system.  The units are equipped with a diesel engine type
VB-504-210, locally manufactured under license from Cummins by Diesel Nacional, S.A. (DINA) The objective of reducing smoke emissions was experimentally achieved after a series of tests.  Values obtained were compared with the original ones, thus leading
to an optimization of the settings in the engine variables to reduce visible smoke (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Nitrogen oxides play a major role in the formation of photochemical smog and in acid rain production.  Described here is a new chemical process capable of completely removing NOx from the products of combustion.  The effectiveness of this process is estab
lished in flow tube experiments.  Further, a demonstration of the practical feasibility of this method is illustrated by eliminating NOx from a portion of the exhaust from a single-cylinder diesel engine.  Based on these results it is concluded that this
process for rapid reduction of nitrogen oxides could play a major role in controlling NOx emission from most combustion devices. (From the author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper describes fracture mechanics criteria employed in the development of fracture safe, 155-175 ksi strength level steel cylinders. A new steel composition was developed to obtain the toughness required to satisfy leak before break and plastic frac
ture mode criteria. Cylinders were fabricated from the new steel, and tests were conducted to characterize their flaw tolerance capability. Leak before break and plastic fracture mode performance was verified. Flawed cylinder tests were also conducted on
conventional 3AA 4130X steel cylinders (105-125 ksi strength level) to characterize their flaw tolerance capability. The flaw tolerance capability of the high strength cylinders was found to be equal to that of the conventional low strength steel cylinder
s at respective service stresses.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of solid and gaseous fuels is promoted by the author.  These fuels are much more prevelant than the depeleting oil reserves and the renewable biomass resources offer a potentially unending source of energy.  The natural gas reserves are seen as a
stepping stone between oil-based fuels and renewable biomass.  The efficient use of energy stored in natural gas is also discussed in terms of its use as CNG, Octane, Fuel, and GTG.  Mention is made of biomass/biogas programs taking place or under conside
ration in New Zealand, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of diesel-powered mine vehicles is growing due to advantages in cost and mobility.  Concern over the impact of diesel exhaust emissions, particularly in the underground mine environment, has recently arisen.  A literature search revealed a relativ
ely small amount of work has been done on the subject and results obtained were highly dependent on engine type and operating conditions.  More information is required in regard to the reduction of emissions, especially particulates and NO2.  It is recomm
ended further engine studies using typical mine diesel be conducted

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Estimates of turbulent burning speed, burning zone thickness, and randomness of ignition delay have been incorporated in a model of spark- ignited engine combustion.  The estimates have been made on the assumption that turbulence during combustion is homo
genous, isotropic and has Tennekes' small-scale structure with integral length scale proportional to chamber height.  Flame propagation rate has been assumed to depend on turbulence intensity in accord with Chomiak's vortex-bursting hypothesis.  The resul
ting method of calculating combustion has been tested with cylinder pressure data from a Ricardo single-cylinder engine over a wide range of RPM and equivalence ratio and operating with natural gas fuel.  Hot wire measurements of turbulence intensity were
made in the motored engine, but window-averaged estimates of intensity were a factor of two lower than ensemble-averaged estimates.  Given a factor of two uncertainty in the turbulence intensity measurement it can be said that estimates of combustion dur
ation and pressure agreed well with experimental data over the range of speed and equivalence ratio.  The sensitivity of the calculation method to alterations in assumed parameters has been tested.  The most important uncertainty appears to be the turbule
nce intensity.  (Author abstract NOTE:  Also published in Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, v. 109(4):410-418, Oct. 1987

or domestic hot water, and a photovoltaic generator in conjuction with a hydrogen/oxygen  storage system, energetic self-sufficiency is achievable. Planning of the Self-Sufficient Solar House (SSSH) began in 1988, the start of the construction was in June
1991 and completion was in October 1992. A three year period of measurements in the occupied building with 145 m2 living area will operate without emitting any pollution. The intention of the project is to show the technical potential of solar energy to
replace all enviromentally damaging energy carriers in a dwelling. The demonstration of the technical potential is the basis for clarifying the economic potential. Many of the technologies and components to be applied in the SSSH will find their way into
commercial application under the aspect of sustainable development in the future. This paper concentrates on the PV/Hydrogen-System of the SSSH. A detailed description of the building with all components will be published in (3).

The 7,500 ton ship Accolade II, a natural gas fueled ship, is now in routine service hauling limestone over a 80 mile route between Port Adelaide, Australia and a quarry across St. Vincent's Gulf.  The ships' four stroke diesel engines can operate on 100
percent diesel fuel but when operating in the pilot oil/natural gas mode, diesel fuel is cut to about 7% of the full load fuel requirement.  Though costing considerably more than a conventional carrier, fuel savings are expected to be cut by about $275,00
0 (U.S.) per year

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of compressed natural gas (CNG) as a fuel for heavy transport engines is still in the development stage, however, experience has shown promising results in certain applications.  While most of the recent work done in New Zealand on CNG use has bee
n centered around non-turbocharged, high speed, spark ignition (SI) conversions, there is still likely to be a role for dual fuel engines in some applications.  This paper presents a review of New Zealand experiences with the use of CNG as a fuel in heavy
transport diesel engines.  Both dual fuel and 100% CNG fueling (dedicated spark ignition conversions) are discussed.  The advantages and disadvantages of each are reviewed in terms of vehicle performance, fuel costs and operational experiences.  Brief re
views of experimental results and discussions of technical aspects of conversions, experience in fleet use, economic and operational aspects, current research and computer modelling of fleet performance are also included.  (author abstract)  This is the s

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The sulphide stress cracking of steel is essentially a hydrogen embrittlement phenomenon caused by contact with environments containing hydrogen sulphide. Among other factors, the prosperity for sulphide stress cracking tends to increase with increasing m
aterial strength (hardness) and hydrogen sulphide content. Steel cylinders used in compressed natural gas service are potentially susceptible to sulphide stress cracking due to the small amount of hydrogen sulphide usually found in processed natural gas.
In Canada, research has determined that the high strength steel natural gas vehicle cylinders currently in use are resistant to sulphide stress cracking under the maximum hydrogen sulphide levels allowed in "pipeline quality" natural gas. It was found t
hat low alloy steels (AISI 41XX and its modifications) are acceptable for NGV service in pipeline quality gas (maximum H2S of 23 mg/m3) at a maximum average hardness of HRC 33 in the quenched and tempered condition.Available: Price $40 contact Kelly

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

AirCare is an inspection and maintenance program intended to identify vehicles with excess emissions. Of an overall vehicle fleet inspected from December 1993 through May 1994, only a small portion represented alternative transportation fuel vehicles. Alm
ost all propane and natural gas powered vehicles are created by converting a gasoline vehicle.In the AirCare inspections, ATF vehicles fail at a rate well above comparable gasoline models. A statistical analysis about failing the test as well as test re
sults are included in this copy of the presentation. One of the listed solutions for an effective conversion is the deesign of an ideal conversion kit whose use reaches emissions at least as good as the gasoline version prior to conversion.OEM natural g
as vehicles tested at the AirCare Research have shown impressive emissions performance - surpassing an equivalent gasoline unit. Compared to a conversion, an OEM vehicle has assurance of compliance of the engine/fuel system with emission standards plus du
rability and warranty but may cost more.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The energy efficiency of various piston engine options for series hybrid automobile are compared with conventional, battery powered electric, and proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell hybrid automobiles.  Gasoline, compressed natural gas (CNG), and hyd
rogen are considered for these hybrids.  The enigne and fuel comparisons are done on a basis of equal weight, drag and rolling resistance.  The relative emissions of these various fueled vehicle options are also presented.  It is concluded that a highly o
ptimized, hydrogen fueled, piston engine, series electric hybrid automobile will have efficiency comparible to a similar fuel cell hybrid automobile and will have fewer total emissions than the battery vehicle, even without a catalyst. (from Author's abst
ract)

This paper, presented at the 1991 Windsor Workshop on Alternative Fuels (Toronto, Ontario; June 24 - 26, 1991), reports on two recent developments in auto propane that will allow propane to enter the mass-scale motor vehicle market.  The developments disc
ussed here are in the areas of supply and environmental performance.  Relating to supply, there is an overview given of increased production from natural gas, increased refinery production of LPG and LPG delivery.  The paper also reviews environmental per
formance, relating to regulated emissions and greenhouse gas emissions

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This study assesses the performance, economy and emissions of a representative spark-ignition engine converted to natural gas through accepted techniques using commercially available carburation systems.  The tests were performed on an engine dynamometer,
at fixed points of load and speed.  Results were calculated to be accurate in the order of +/- 2% of readings.  A warning is given that results of real driving tests may vary as numerous transient regimes of load and speed are encountered.  Some of the r
esults encountered included:  1) a significant decrease in engine performance at wide-open throttle, 2) a significant increase in brake specific energy consumption and, 3) optimization of spark-timing and air-fuel ratio has the potential of enhancing part
-load efficiency by 2-8% (Phase II C 0688

Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) made a firm committment to the NGV program in 1981.  From a mere 10 vehicles to be converted the utility now runs 650 vehicles on natural gas, and has another 150 slated for conversion by the end of the yea
r.  NIPSCO currently has 16 refuelling stations in operation.  They estimate annual savings amount to $500,000 due to reduced fuel and maintenance costs.  NIPSCO is also involved in marketing the NGV program throughout its service area

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Utilities that use propane-air peakshaving plants to meet cold weather distribution system demands may need to be more concerned about meeting gas composition requirements for new engines which are more "fuel sensitive". This report identifies various alt
ernatives for meeting composition limits. Evaluation criteria included fueling station equipment, real estate requirements and costs, distribution system peakshaving and reinforcement costs, potential for station equipment and vehicle engine damage and cu
stomer satisfaction. The results of the evaluation indicate that for Minnegasco to meet natural gas composition requirements, CNG produced from LNG appears to be a viable cost effective alternative for certain site locations and sized ocations.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

One problem facing every company active in the growing electric vehicle market is compatibility of systems and vehicle integration.  For every vehcle, there is a unique set of requirements and configurations.  This problem is especially evident in the ele
ctric power train design with the various vehicle sizes, drive configurations, and system voltages.  The solution is to design an electric drive system with a flexible architecture.  Westinghouse has designed and built a family of systems that are based o
n the original 100 horsepower design.  This single motor and controller configuration has been installed in vehicles ranging in size from small cars to large transit and school buses.  The design can produce units with varying power outputs for use in bot
h front and rear wheel drive vehicles.  The motor controller electronics can also be replicated to control the complex power flow of electric hybrid vehicles.  The system is tailorable to the various input voltages to meet the desired vehicle performance.

Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been used successfully in New Zealand since 1979 as an alternative fuel for dual fuelled motor vehicles.  CNG is stored in vehicles at high pressure (200 bar) in gas cylinders.  These cylinders are designed to be as light
as possible.  As a result of potential problems that have been investigated it has been necessary for a New Zealand code specifically for lightweight cylinders to be written and put into use. The major difference between the New Zealand Specification DZ54
54 code fo lightweight CNG steel automotive compressed natural gas cylinders for use in New Zealand and other gas cylinder specifications, designed for industrial gas, are outlined in the paper.   The paper suggests that an international standard for ligh
tweight CNG cylinders should be adopted and points out the areas where the NZ code is not applicable as an international standard (From author abstract Includes brief author biography 13 refs

This paper discusses quantitatively the environmental advantages of NGV's, gives an economic evaluation of the introduction of NGV's, including the role of automobile manufactures in producing the vehicles and fuel resellers in operating refuelling facili
ties, and discusses the rational for amended legislation. Specific incentives in the form of government subsidies and taxation relief are also discussed and the current status of measures to promote the popularization of NGV's is presented.

This paper, presented at the conference on Commercializing Clean Fuels for Transportation (April 12-14, 1992, Ottawa, ON) outlines the approach taken i the United States to helping establish a role for alternative fuels i controlling air pollution.  There
is particular focus on California as th author is most familiar with California's programs, which are generally mor completely developed than those of the federal or other state governments.  Th paper covers a brief review of air quality problems, and ov
erview of regulatio concerning the quality of existing motor fuels , emission standards for ne vehicles and the use of alternative fuels in those vehicles.  Demonstratio programs showing the feasibility of cleaner vehicles are described, as well as recent
amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.  Technological considerations regarding methanol and natural gas as motor fuels are discussed.  (from author introduction

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The paper analyses the basic aspects of spark assisted direct injection (SADI) engines of the type with the start of combustion close to the beginning of fuel injection, and with no special arrangements for fuel vaporization on the combustion chamber wall
s. The analysis refers to the fuel sensitivity of the engine, the correlation between air motion and fuel injection, and the combustion development in this engine.  The analysis evidentiates the high sensitivity of this engine to certain characteristics o
f the fuel, and explains some particularities of the engine operation like the stabilized flame front, the necessity of spark assistance during the entire fuel injection, and the unstable operation in certain conditions.  Also the influence of SADI engine
characteristics on its performance is investigated.  Solutions for improving the operation of this engine, as well as the engine perspectives are discussed.  (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The feasibility of dual-fuel operation with natural gas in a prechamber diesel engine was studied with special emphasis on fuel consumption and cylinder pressure development.  The effects of air restriction, pilot diesel flow rate and injection timing wer
e also studied.  Dual-fuel operation showed poor part-load fuel consumption; near full load the fuel consumption was close to that of straight diesel operation.  In the absence of injection timing adjustment the maximum power output of dual-fuel operation
was severely limited by the maximum cylinder pressure.  Retarding the injection timing was effective in reducing the maximum cylinder pressure to a safe level.  The analysis of apparent energy release indicates the differences in combustion mechanism bet
ween auto-ignition of diesel fuel in straight diesel operation and propagation of flame fronts in dual-fuel operation

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

For most countries of the world natural gas exists or can be produced in great abundance for generations into the future.  Once a nation realizes this potential and the relative ease of using natural gas in place of other traditional fuels, then important
opportunities unfold such as improvement in environment, national economic health, safety and energy independence.  Individuals can benefit from a more economical fuel.  Before individuals, business or government institutions can seriously consider conve
rting to natural gas they must be convinced of intermediate and long term supply.  It must be understood that in most countries conventional proven reserves of natural gas are only the tip of the iceberg.  Beneath that tip are enormous resources of unprov
en conventional and unconventional sources (such as tight sands, coals, peat, shales, hydropressured and geopressured waters, hydrates and biomass conversions.  These resources will provide energy far into the future.  The rate at which they will be tappe
d will be primarily controlled by technology and economics.  Although mass conversion of vehicles to gaseous fuels will be limited by conversion costs, price differences between alternate and conventional fuels, the infrastructure of refueling and nationa
l incentives, it should not be limited by concern for long term supply.  It is estimated that conversion to natural gas of about 10% of the vehicles in Canada and the U.S.A. would essentially eliminate the need to import crude.  Other countries that have
abundant amounts of gas and many vehicles could also significantly reduce their imports.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Processing problems with natural gas hydrates are known to relate to phase equilibria therefore the following hydrate formation prediction methods for the two and three phase regions are compared for relative accuracies.  Three methods of prediction, the
gas gravity method, the equilibrium constant method, and the van der Waals and Platteeuw method are examined in the three phase condition.  The gas gravity method was the least accurate and required the least time and resources.  The equilibrium method wa
s more time consuming and more accurate than the first method while the van der Waals procedure yielded the most accurate results and was the most complex. Two methods (Hammerschmidt's and Menton, Parrish and Sloan's) of predicting hydrate inhibition are
also compared.  There is very little information on prediction methods for two phase equilibria however one process connected to the van der Waals method is in the literature.  Discoveries of signifi cant hydrate reserves in the environment mean that a go
od understanding of measuring and predicting hydrate phase equilibria will enhance future recovery of natural gas from these sources

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Increasing awareness of environmental issues and new legislation in California has led to broadened interest in new battery systems for electric vehicles.  Some of the most promising candidates for the future are based on alkali metal anodes (Lithium or S
odium) and Polymer electrolytes and are still in the experimental stages.  Research on Lithium/Polymer batteries has been underway for about fifteen years, but work on Sodium/Polymer analogs has begun only recently.  The Sodium devices are expected to ret
ain the safety and design advantages of a solid state system, but at a lower price (A 35 kWh Lithium Polymer laminate battery is expected to cost about $2400; the Sodium analog only $1400).  Our laboratory is now in the process of developing these new bat
teries for electric vehicle use.  Because the choice of cathode is more limited for Sodium than for Lithium, an early goal was to identify suitable materials for positive electrodes.  The use of Cobalt Oxides in Sodium/Polymer cells increased performance
levels to those seen with typical Lithium Polymer cells.  While these results were encouraging, Cobalt Oxides did not meet additional requirements of low cost, wide availability and low toxicity necessary for the EV market.  In order to meet these criteri
a, it is necessary to use Manganese Oxides in the cathodes.  We now discuss our recent results with Sodium/Polymer/Manganese Oxide cell in terms of the chemistry of the positive electrode as well as performance and cost.  A Sodium/Polymer/Manganese Oxide
battery may well be the least expensive system now being considered for electric vehicle use.

The observed lean ignition limits of homogenous methane-air mixtures in a spark ignition engine over a wide range of compression ratios and intake temperatures are amenable to correlation on the basis of the mean mixture temperature at the time of passing
the spark.  The corresponding rich limits could also be correlated in terms of the rise in the mean mixture temperature during compression.  Attention to the reduction of heat losses during compression would aid in extending the limits.  (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The paper presents three-dimensional simulations of the in-cylinder processes in Direct Injection (DI) Diesel Engines.  First, mathematical formulation is described with emphasis on physical models used for turbulence, interphase friction, evaporation and
chemical reaction.  Then, the results of 3D transient calculations of the two-phase fuel-air mixing and evaporation processes are presented.  Four test cases have been considered to demonstrate the effects of changes in:  a) fuel injector, b) computation
al gird, and c) initial air swirl velocity.  Computed results show that each of these parameters has significant effect on the spread and evaporation of liquid fuel spray.  The results of low and high air swirl cases are in qualitative agreement with publ
ished experimental observations.  Finally, a test calculation of 3D, two-phase flow with evaporation and combustion is presented for demonstration purposes.  The calculated temperature distributions and the cylinder pressure history show realistic trends.
Improvements in physical models, particularly for evaporation and chemical reaction, and fine grid distributions are needed for further refinements

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

An examination of the interactions of petroleum supply and demand patterns suggests the depletion of U.S. oil reserves and the increasing importance of oil consumption in U.S. transportation are causes for greater attention to the development of alternati
ve (not-oil based) transportation fuels.  Absent such development, and historical lessons suggest that another period of rising oil prices, erratic oil market behavior, and subsequent economic difficulty is probable within the next two decades.  Methanol
is argued to be the most likely and most desirable substitute transportation fuel, because it can be produced more economically and used more efficiently than gasoline when derived from the rapidly expanding worldwide supplies of natural gas. (Author abst

A two-stage Delphi study was conducted to collect information that would enable a technical and economic assessment of electric (EV) and hybrid electric (HEV) vehicles. The first-stage worldwide survey was completed in fall 1994, while the second-stage wa
s completed by summer 1995.  The paper reports results from the second round of the survey and the major differences between the two rounds.  This second-stage international survey obtained information from 93 expert respondents from the automotive techno
logy field.  The second-stage response provided the following key results:

Within the framework of its development strategy in automotive applications, THOMSON-CSF, has decided to regard an engagement in the area of alternative transportation means as very promising.  It has thus initiated the development of various components f
or electric vehicles.  This article will concentrate on the presentation of a drive unit, which has been designed and developed by AUXILEC, a subsidiary of THOMSON-CSF.The drive unit consists of a separate excited synchronous machine with related powe
r electronics and control electronics.  Motor and electronics have been developed as an integrated unit for application in small and medium sized personal cars.  The drive unit has remarkable performance characteristics such as high efficiency, a large fi
eld weakening range and maximum protection against dust and water.  In comparison to other solutions such as induction drives or permanent magnet drives it offers advantages concerning requirements for power electronics and computation capacity.  The
article will also describe other component developed by THOMSON-CSF such as an on-board charger, a static converter and a battery monitoring system.  A demonstration vehicle has been equipped with the drive unit and with some of these comnponents. Its cha
racteristics and performance will be resumed at the end of this paper.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The cause of failure of Inconel 751 material exhaust valves operated in an ebulient-cooled natural gas engine was investigated.  The severe corrosive attack in the neck area of the valves was identified as sulfidation attack initiated by the presence of d
eposits on the valve consisting of calcium sulfate from oil additives and carbon from the combustion process.  The results indicated that carbon must be present to obtain localized reducing conditions for the sulfidation attack by calcium sulfate to take
place.  Sulfate reduction leads to a high sulfur chemical potential at the surface of the alloy resulting in sulfur transport into the substrate.  It was also found that aluminizing the Inconel 751 materia significantly improved the resistance to sulfidat
ion attack

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

As natural gas (methane) has become of interest as an automotive fuel, certain problems associated with it (its high minimum ignition energy, long ignition delay, and low flame speed relative to gasoline) have had to be addressed.  This paper looks at the
possibility of solving these problems by using a more efficient ignition source to reduce ignition delay and to enhance the initial burning rate.  The relative merits of the plasma-jet igniter, multiple electrode spark plug and conventional spark plug we
re investigated by comparing the time taken to burn the first 10% of a stochiometric methane-air mixture in a constant volume bomb.  The multiple electrode spark plug, using only the energy of a conventional ignition system reduced this time by 12% compar
ed to a conventional spark plug.  Larger reductions (up to 45%) were found for the multiple electrode spark plug and plasma jet igniter when additional energy (up to 4.5J) was supplied to the discharge

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A principal impediment at present to the growth of the compressed natural gas fueled vehicle (NGFV) fraction of the privately-owned vehicle fleet is the lack of adequate and widespread refueling facilities.  Many of the vehicles on the road today could pr
ofitably convert to dual fuel operation if refueling facilities existed For the longer-term, however, the incentive toward conversion may disappear.  The emergence of more fuel-efficient gasoline vehicles, the replacement of needed large vehicles with die
sel-powered units, and the general trend toward pricing fuels on Btu content, all minimize the economic benefit realizable today by operating a converted dual fuel vehicle Dedicated vehicles specifically designed to operated on compressed natural gas, whi
ch take advantage of the properties of this fuel, can help to alleviate some of the vanishing economic incentives, although the refueling-point availability problem must be solved before such vehicles are competitive in the marketplace This paper examines
the above factors and estimates the potential market penetration of retrofit and OEM NGFVs

Each market in which compressed natural gas (CNG) has grown significantly has enjoyed an abundance of natural gas and a considerable price spread between gasoline and compressed natural gas.  Canada has very favorable economics for CNG utilization and a m
arket based on publicly available CNG is rapidly emerging.  Based on current economics, CNG is expected to penetrate a substantial percentage of the vehicle market in Canada, and represents a potential 30% increase in natural gas usage. (From author abstr

The paper discusses the design of a 45 kW motor commissioned for a small family hatchback- the Rover Metro Hermes.  The motor was designed to give rated power from 3600 - 12000 rpm at a terminal voltage of 150 VAC.  The unit has been tested on a dynamomet
er over the full envelope of performance and methods for improving the accuracy of measurement are discussed.  The testing done on a lightweight Brushless DC machine can be operated constant power over a 3.5:1 speed range with excellent high power eff
iciency.  The part load high speed efficiency is impaired by poor iron loss figures.

The goal of the Department of Energy (DOE) Electric and Hybrid Vehicle (EHV) Program is to support industry in developing technologies that will lead to the successful commercialization of electric and hybrid vehicles.  DOE believes that electric transpor
tation options will contribute significantly toward achieving national goals of substituting more abundant non-petroleum energy sources for petroleum and improvbing air quality in our cities.  An aggressive battery research and development (R&D) program i
s critical to achieving the goals of the EHV Program.  DOE's Advanced Battery Systems Program, a key component of the EHV Program, supports research to identify and develop the most promising rechargeable battery technologies for EHV applications.  The Ba
ttery Program is being largely implemented through a cooperative R&D agreement with the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC).  In addition, an Exploratory Technology Research Program supports these activities by developing the electrochemistr
y and eletrochemial engineering technology base and exploring new and promnising long term options for batteries and high power storage devices such as ultra-capacitors.  This paper provides an overview of the DOE Advanced Battery Systems Program (includi
ng cooperative efforts with the USABC) as well as a brief summary of the DOE Exploratory Technology Research Program.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper discusses the need for a universal fuelling system for gaseous fuels -- a kit which will work on all vehicles.  A universal gaseous fuel injection system is currently under development for NGV powered gasoline type engines. However, the system
is applicable to, and funding is being sought for, propane (LPG) applications and for application of the system to diesel-type engines operated as Otto cycle engines.  Two problem areas which have been identified in the potential of this GFI system are th
at the acceptance of the system by the gasoline computer's diagnostics and adaptive memory system is marginal

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Tougher regulations on the maximum sulfur and aromatics content of diesel fuels could force U.S. refineries to accomodate another round of environmental issues, requiring costly investments.  New rules, under investigation by the EPA and the U.S. Congress
, would limit the sulfur content to 0.05 wt% and total aromatics content to 20 vol %.  The rule are seen as a way to reduce acid rain concerns in the U.S. as well a particulate emissions from diesel fueled vehicles.  In order to accomodate these regulatio
ns additional investment may be needed in distillate hydrotreating capacity, hydrogen producing capacity, and sulfur recovery capacity, as well as changes in the blends of components normally used in diesel, and in the crude slate normally charged to the
refinery.  It is estimated that the cost to the U.S. refining industry could be as high as $3-4 billion dollars.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Long Island Bus (LIB) in Garden City, New York, has been operating ten Orion CNG buses powered by Cummins L10 natural gas engines. Five of these engines were updated to low NOx emissions specification. This paper compares the low NOx specification buses t
o the original calibration and to diesel control buses using Detroit Diesel Allison 6V-92TA engines. The results indicate that the fuel economy of the CNG buses was approximately 14 percent lower that of the control buses. The low NOx buses had fuel econo
my approximately 16 percent lower that of the control buses. Both types of CNG bus showed significant decrease in NMHC, CO, and NOx when compared to the diesel buses. The buses using the low NOx calibration had lower NOx, CO, and fuel efficiency than the
other CNG buses. However, the methane and NMHC emissions were higher.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report describes the development of non linear finite element models of natural gas vehicle (NGV) cylinders and mounting systems using ABACUS code. The specific cylinders modelled were:- Type CNG-1 - all aluminum (7000 series alloy) 9.8'' O.D. x 52
'' long- Type CNG-4 - full composite 16.3'' O.D. x 32'' long- Type CNG-3 - composite overwrap of aluminium liner 12'' O.D. x 36'' longNon linear finite element analysis was needed to analyze the contact behavior between the cylinder and the compon
ents of the mounting system, the behavior of fibre wound cylinder walls, and yield and relaxation behavior in the all-metal cylinder.The models of the more complex cylinders and recommended mounting straps were validated by testing instumented systems
at Powertech Labs in Surrey, B.C..The work showed that the mounting systems, provided that the gasketing material used between the mount and tank is suitable, do not have a significant effect on stresses in the cylinder. However, it has been identifi
ed that the current code for installation of cylinders is inadequate because it allows for strap designs that could yield on installation.The models were used to identify specific strap end designs that would reduce stresses in the straps.It is re
commended that the installation code (CAN/CGA-B149.4-M91) be rewritten to recognize these issues. The models themselves have the inbuilt capability to be used for other purposes. They can be used to examine impact loading and can also be used to look at h
eat transfer along the length to further aid the understanding of the transfer along the length to further aid the understanding of the transfer of heat to pressure relief devices.To order a copy of this report at cost of $30 contact Kelly Darby of

This paper, based on a presentation for a conference, provides examples of the successful application of natural gas conversion of diesel vehicles which have taken place in British Columbia over the last few years.  Examples discussed include:  a 72-seat
B.C. Transit bus; the ferry M.V. Klatawa; a heavy-duty line haul truck; and, an off-highway truck at Sparwood Mine.  Also discussed is the John F. Adams Demonstration Project, a commercial station which dispenses natural gas, converts diesel vehicles to d
ual-fuel natural gas/diesel operation, and monitors the results of the conversion and operation

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper discusses the failure of the gas industry to penetrate the natural gas vehicle fuel market.  It is suggested that a realistic estimate of the U.S. marketplace reveals a market at least 3 l/3 times greater than most current market evaluations.
The author feels the utilities are the ones who have to overcome the "chicken or the egg" dilemma and make a decision to take a risk.  An important element of the industries present dilemma is that they have accepted conventional compressor technology and
have attempted to force it on an unwilling marketplace.  One of the first steps they must take is to develop a compressor which can be safely operated by a non-technical individual and which needs much less maintenance than the current technology

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A new process under development at the Brookhaven National Laboratory departs significantly from current commercial practice for synthesizing methanol from natural gas.  The significant innovations in this process are described and the consequences of the
changes are outlined.  A process flow sheet for the new synthesis is described and a cost estimate, based on the equipment and flow sheet, is presented and compared with cost estimates for conventional, low pressure methanol synthesis.  In addition, cost
estimates for shipping natural gas values to distant markets as synthesized methanol, or as liquefied natural gas, are compared.  The economic advantages of the Brookhaven methanol process indicate that methanol shipping can deliver natural gas values at
lower cost than can LNG for the same energy delivery, while decreasing capital investment requirements significantly.  (Author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper reports on the effect of position and timing of gas admission on the performance of a spark-ignition engine using methane.  The investigation was aimed at exploring the effect of design limitations experienced with turbocharged medium-speed eng
ines Performance was judged on the criteria of optimum specific fuel consumption combined with minimum cyclic dispersion Results were obtained at a fixed fuel consumption and mostly at fixed air/gas ratios and are not, therefore, necessarily directly appl
icable to commercial engines.  For near stoichiometric air/gas ratios, optimum performance was obtained most easily by early and prolonged gas admission.  Better thermal efficiency was obtained with weak mixtures, about 80 percent of stoichiometric, and o
ptimum gas admission was generally less obvious.  Performance patterns did not vary consistently with gas admission timing; they improved or deteriorated with late gas admission, depending on the type of air inlet valve-presumably owing to air motion and
gas/air mixing in the cylinder From the results obtained, it seems probable that cyclic dispersion was minimal when the mixture around the spark was at, or near, stoichiometric and was most easily achieved by perfect mixing when the overall mixture was ne
ar stoichiometric

The current state-of-the art of electric vehicles will be represented with examples of recently developed prototype vehicles--GM Griffon and G Vans, Ford ETX-I and ETX-II and Eaton's DSEP.  The acceleration, top speed, and vehicle handling of these electr
ic vehicles will be delineated to demonstrate their positive comparability with conventional vehicles.  the immediate prospects for the commercialization of the elctric G-Van based on the GM Vandura and teh TEVan based on the Chrysler minivan will be reve
aled.  The progress being made in teh development of a fuel cell/battery hybrid bus and advanced electric vehicle batteries will be described.  The potential benefits of electric vehicles in the reduction of oil consumption, reduction of air pollution and
load management will be postulated. (from Author's abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

LPG demand for vehicles amounts to 1.8 MM tons annually, equivalent to about 11% of the total LPG consumption in Japan.  The feature which dominates the demand of LPG as a vehicle fuel in Japan is the high penetration of LPG powered vehicles into taxi fle
ets.  This has been made possible following the rationalization in the taxi business in the early 1960s.  Today, three quarters of LPG vehicles, numbering some 235,000 while representing only about 1% or the total number of vehicles, account for nearly 93
% of all taxicabs.  (Author Abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Two heavy duty turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engines have been converted to spark ignition (SI) for natural gas fuelling.  One engine features two valves per cylinder, high primary swirl and a compact combustion chamber.  The other engine has four v
alves per cylinder and a more open combustion chamber shape.  Both engines were characterized on a dynamometer and subsequently put into service where one of the engines has been monitored extensively. The conversion process, dynamometer testing and optim
ization required to bring these engines into reliable fleet service are presented in this paper.  (from author abstract) This is the seventh paper in "Gaseous Fuels: Technology, Performance and Emissions"

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Dwindling petroleum resources call for alternative fuels to be substituted in the field of transport.  Alcohol fuels are therefore attracting wide attention.  Efforts should be directed at using alcohol with the best possible efficiency, that is, in the D
iesel engine.  The difficulty is in the markedly low ignition quality of alcohol which might be overcome by the use of relatively expensive additives or complex dual fuel systems Another approach is offered by the MAN-FM combustion system which is derived
from a direct injection Diesel engine with ignition assisted by a spark plug.  The features which make the FM-engine specially suited for burning alcohol are:  Diesel-type compression ratio, direct injection, wall deposition of the fuel in the combustion
chamber and a largely conventional ignition system

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Stirling engine represents an alternative power plant with superior efficiency and multifuel capability over existing engines, but success in applying the Stirling to automotive use has remained elusive.  Its potential has been realized through the de
velopment of an automotive Stirling engine, designated the Mod II.  The Mod II engine represents the culmination of the Automotive Stirling Engine Development Program begun in 1978.  The program was managed by the Department of Energy and administered by
the NASA-Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.  The goals of the program were to develop an automotive Stirling engine and to transfer Stirling technology to the U.S.  The Mod II Stirling engine demonstrates the achievement of these two goals.  Instal
led in a General Motors 1985 Chevrolet Celebrity car, this engine has a predicted combined fuel economy on unleaded gasoline of 17.t km/l (41 mi/gal) -- a value 50% above the fleet average.  The Mod II Stirling engine is a four-cylinder V-drive design wit
h a single crankshaft.  The engine is also equipped with all the controls and auxiliaries necessary for automotive operation.  (Author Abstract)

The ultimate purpose for this document is that it constitute the performance standard for North America regarding fueling station reciprocating compressors Applicable to dispensing natural gas to vehicles. Prior to that promulgation, however there is to b
e an interim 12 month period of use of this document as the industry's Guidelines. During this interim phase interested parties and manufacturers of relevant products are encouraged to submit their comments to the Secretariat (address below) as to the sui
tability of the text to become a certification standard applicable to the fabrication of standardization reciprocating  compressors (i.e. excepting short-run custom orders).This proposed standard requires the purchaser to specify certain details. A bull
et in the margin indicates that a decision by the purchaser is required. This proposed standard is developed from the Specification for Packaged Reciprocating Compressors for Oil and Gas Production Services, API Specification 11P (SPEC 11P), Second Edit
ion, November, 1989 and used with permission of American Petroleum Institute, 1220 L Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. 2005. Address submissions to C.J. Barrigar, Standards Engineer, International Approval Services, 55 Scarsdale Road, Toronto (Don Mills

An experimental investigation of the effects of squish motion on turbulence generation, burn-rate and engine performance has been undertaken in a Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder research engine.  An experimental combustion chamber design incorporating a num
ber of squish generated jets was used to enhance the turbulent motion in the chamber during combustion.  A single squish generated jet motion directed towards the spark plug resulted in the highest thermal efficiency during high speed lean operation, whil
e burn-rate analysis indicated that squish action was most effective during the main burn period.  (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The potential for increasing the on-vehicle fuel storage capacity of natural gas vehicles by adsorption of methane on high-surface-area materials, especially zeolites, is discussed.  Room temperature adsorption capacities of a number of high-surface-area
materials are determined using gravimetric methods at up to 1000 psig.  The initial adsorption rates of almost all of the zeolites tested, which represents more than 80 percent of the total adsorption, are fast.  After investigation of two techniques for
correcting crude high-pressure adsorption isotherms for nonadsorbed gas, it appears better to estimate the free volume using a fluid which cannot penetrate the pores of the zeolite

This paper reviews British gas business strategy for the UK road vehicle market. It reports the progress made with conversion, on board storage and refuelling technologies, paying particular attention to the key issue of tail pipe emissions. The roles of
the recently formed British and European NGV association are also considered in the context of their impact on British gas activities. The paper demonstrates that a business and technical basis exists for the continued expansion of the NGV market in the U
nited Kingdom.

An analysis of the natural gas industry as it stands today from the viewpoint of the customers, the equipment suppliers, and the gas utilities is presented.  The suggestion is then made that there is a need to encourage the acceptance of natural gas as a
vehicular fuel which is not currently being met.  It is felt that the solution to this problem is an aggresive, well-planned strategic marketing effort and that the natural gas industry is in the position to provide the needed leadership for such a progra

Over the next eight years, world oil prices will be extremely volatile, experiencing possibly significant price downturns but reflecting a longterm price upturn.  Short term oil price changes will depend on, among other things, OPECs resolve to restrain p
roduction during the remainder of 1987, the oil export policy of the USSR, the health of the world economy, the level of global inventories as 1988 approaches, and the level of demand response to lower oil prices in Europe and Japan

Experimental measurements of water content of methane gas in equilibrium with hydrate are presented at 1000 and 1500 psia for temperatures greater than -10 degress F.  A new chromatographic technique for determining water concentration of gas in equilibri
um with hydrate was used to eliminate some of the errors inherent in previous investigations. A method is suggested for calculating the water content of methane in equilibrium with its hydrate above 32 degrees F at any pressure up to 1500 psia.  The exper
imental data indicate that methane should be significantly drier than indicated by existing water content charts in order to prevent hydrate formation.  The data reported herein should be strictly interpreted as applying only to methane, rather than natur
al gases, due to the fact that methane forms a different hydrate structure from that normally formed by natural gases.  (Author abstract

Vacuum insulation and phase-change thermal storage have been used to enhance the heat retention of a prototype catalytic converter. Storing heat in the converter between more trips allows exhaust gases to be converted more quickly, significantly reducing
cold-start emissions. Using a small metal hybride, the thermal conductance of the vacuum insulation can be varied continuously between 0.49 and 27 W/m2 K (R-12 to 0.2 insulation) to prevent overheating of the catalyst. A prototype was installed in a Dodge
Neon with a 2.0 - liter engine. Following a standard preconditioning and a 23 hour cold soak, an FTP (Federal Test Procedure) emissions test was performed. Although exhaust temperatures during preconditioning were not hot enough to melt the phase-change
material, the vacuum insulation performed well, resulting in a converter temperature of 146 *C after the 23-hour soak, at 27*C. Compared to the same conveter at ambient conditions, overall emissions of CO and HC were reduced by 52% and 29%, 0.27 and 0.37
g/mile, respectively. The maximum converter temperature during the FTP cycle was 720*C. This limited testing was performed with a nearly-fresh palladium-only catalyst, but demonstrates the potential of this vacuum insulation approach for emissions reducti
on and thermal control. Further testing is ongoing. An initial assessment of several production issues is made, including high-volume fabrication challenges, durability, and cost. (author)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In the arrangement of ZEV drive system, the direct coupling of the electrical motor to the wheel results in a significant reduction of the vehicle weight, as well as it allows an improvement of the propulsion system efficiency.  For such low-speed and hig
h-torque applications, the newly conceived slotless axial-flux permanent magnet motors exhibit great advantages, since they can be designed for an extremely high torque-to-weight ratio, and the resulting machine campactness and lightness allow housing of
the motor into the wheel rim.  This paper deals with the development of an electrical scooter prototype, which has been designed for application in the urban mobility.  The scooter propulsion drive uses an axial-flux PM motor which is coupled directly to
the vehicle rear wheel and fed by means of an IGBT bi-directional power converter.  The paper discusses the scooter drive configuration and reports experimental results taken from the axial-flux PM motor drive prototype.

The contents of Volume II deal primarily with the technology and economics of vehicle conversion, refuelling equipment design, etc. for using gaseous fuels in transportation vehicles. Other issues explored include safety considerations, vehicle exhaust em
issions when using gaseous fuels, sensitivity analyses of the economic parameters of fleet vehicle conversions, identification of the best fleets for conversion, new developments in gaseous fuel storage and compressor design plus research and development
needs. Volume I is the executive summary; Volume III reports the institutional barriers and a market assessment of gas-fueled vehicles (GFVs) in New York State. The basics of vehicle conversion and refueling station design are explained in detail for comp
ressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), and liquefied petroleum gases or propane (LNG). CNG is typically stored at 2400 pounds per square inch (psi) in the vehicle while LNG is stored in cryogenic storage tanks at low pressure (60 psi or le
ss) LPG pressure during storage range as high as 200 psi

The California Clean Air Act requires the Air Resources Board (ARB) to reduce emissions from motor vehicles and other mobile sources to the maximum degree possible.  In response to this and other legislative mandates the ARB recently adopted "Low Emission
Vehicle" (LEV) regulations designed to promote the development and use of vehicle/fuel combinations that would lead to reductions in air contaminants.  This paper discusses the regulations, and describes other ARB activities in support of the new legisla

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) design and operation, no parameter plays a more important role than efficiency.  Unlike conventional vehicles, HEVs are generally energy and power limited by the battery bank and auxiliary power unit.  As a result, the ove
rall system efficiency in the conversion of chemical or stored energy into kinetic energy of the vehicle is the key paramenter that drives the overall system design.We have undertaken a sensitivity analysis of HEVs to understand in detail the various fa
ctors and their respective weights that affect the overall system efficiency.  Our goal is to identify the parameters that most significantly influence vehicle efficiency.  The results of this study may be used as a guide to focus work on the areas of mos
t benefit for HEVs as well as aiding in sizing vehicle components for maximum efficiency.  The simulation tool used is SIMPLEV 3.1, developed by the DOE Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, which runs a time-based simulation on a set of parameter files
for an (hybrid) elecrtric vehicle.  To accomplish this sensitivity analysis we have written a set of programs that conduct a parametric analysis of the vehicle parameters by creating the necessary sets of SIMPLEV input files.  It then runs these SIMPLEV f
iles on a standard test cycle and extracts out the results of the simulation.Using the data this generated, we were able to establish the relative importance of each system parameter.   This paper discusses the assumptions within the SIMPLEV model, the
development of input files and  the parametric programs, and the test cycle chosen. The results of this sensitivity analysis are also presented and analyzed.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The feasibility of converting the Bangkok bus fleet from diesel to compressed natural gas was examined.  Five buses were converted to CNG operation.  No major technical problems were encountered, and no major problems with CNG equipment had been reported
since the buses began operation.  Part of the program involved the building of a CNG refuelling station.  The site chosen was near the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand South Bangkok Power Station.  Although over an hours drive from central Ban
gkok, the site was confirmed as the most suitable for the test program.  The station has operated well, and presented no maintenance problems.  The final part of the program involved a training program for those involved in converting vehicles, for those
who would have to operate and maintain the buses, and for those who would have to operate and maintain the refuelling station.  It was concluded that a successful CNG program could be operated successfully in Thailand.  There is some question however, as
to the economic feasibility of the program, as no work has been done in this area

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The linear programming energy systems analysis model, MARKAL, was used to examine the impact on the Australian energy system of a Mobil process, gas-to-gasoline plant producing up to 100 PJ/a of high octane gasoline from the year 2000.   The total capital
cost of the plant was estimated to be 4100 M$A (1982).  The costs and benefits of introducing this technology were calculated for high, medium, and low assumptions on indigenous oil discovery rates, imported oil prices, and national energy demand levels.
Under the model assumptions, a sufficient requirement for a gas-to-gasoline plant to offer a net benefit to the overall energy system is for the real price of crude oil to increase from a 1995 level of around $A 30/bbl to about $A 45/bbl by the year 202
5.  Even so, if the plant were introduced in the year 2000, it could not achieve the minimum desired return on investment.  If the introduction date were delayed five years the prospect would improve considerably but there would still be less than 30% cha
nce of exceeding a 7.5% real return on capital invested.  Considerable government guarantees would be necessary to underpin what would appear to be a fairly risky investment proposition. Australia faces the certainty of an increasingly costly dependence o
n imported oil after the turn of the century.  Consequently the cost of such guarantees may not be an excessive premium to pay for added security of supply.  (From author abstract

Significant fuel cost reductions are being achieved using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in lieu of gasoline as a vehicular fuel in Postal delivery vehicles.  A total of 98 operational vehicles have been converted for dual fuel operation.  In a twelve month
period the vehicles traveled 446,815 miles on CNG vs. 109,649 miles on gasoline.  CNG usage has increased from 29% in the first month of operation to 89% in the twelfth.  Fuel costs were 9.9 cents per mile for CNG as compared to 14.9 cents per mile for g
asoline

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A Ford 2.3-liter engine was operated using the throttleless Otto-cycle natural gas engine (TONE) concept, first using an electrical heater and then direct exhaust gas recirculation as a source of heating the inlet mixture.  Although the TONE concept using
the electrical heater showed improved brake thermal efficiency during mid- to full-load operation, the less favorable combustion characteristics of the very lean mixtures necessary for no-load operation in the absence of throttling led to smaller than es
timated performance gains at the lowest loads.  A decrease in brake thermal efficiency was observed when direct EGR was used as heat source.  Test data are included.  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The EV fleet of Electricit_ de France (EDF) is composed of 500 vehicles, mainly powered by VRLA (Valve Regulated Lead-Acid) batteries. Reliability and cycle life of the batteries are the major concern that drivers encounter on field.  Quite early, an on-b
oard battery management was pointed out as necessary.  The main functions to be covered are given as follows: battery life recording, charge monitoring, battery management during driving, help in battery maintenance, gauge (state of charge indicator).  To
investigate this concept, an on-board EV battery management device was developed.  Informations on the operating battery and cell behavior are given to the driver.  Overdischarge can be avoided.  Fast charging of VRLA batteries is monitored.  After havin
g tested this device on a small scale, we have started a field experiment on 20 EVs of our fleet.  The aim of this trial is:  firstly to show to users the benefit they can get by adding an on-board battery management device on their present vehicles, seco
ndly to highlight the necessity to include such a system during the EV manufacturing.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Ovonic Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) electric vehicle batteries have progressed to full-sized battery packs powering a variety of electric vehicles.  Under real driving conditions, 70-80 Wh/kg has been delivered to the wheels.  More significantly, Ovonic ba
tteries have the highest volumetric energy density available extendidng the practical range for electric vehicles from under 100 miles to 200 miles and beyond.  Their high power capability has provided 0-60 mph acceleration in under 10 seconds and a top s
peed of approaching 90 mph.  Successful operation has been demonstrated over ambient temperature conditions ranging from -20 deg. F to +105 deg. F.  Ovonic electric vehicle batteries have achieved over 500 charge-discharge cycles under simulated driving c
onditions.  Durability testing of these maintenance-free batteries is now underway in vehicles on the road.  Manufacturing processes have been developed to produce cost-competitive Ovonic batteries.  Consequently, a commercialization program has been init
iated to produce Ovonic NiMH electric vehicle batteries at volume.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Lawrence Livermore, Sandia Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories have a joint project to develop an optmized hydrogen fueled engine for series hybrid automobiles. The major division of responsibility are: system analysis engine design, and kineti
cs modeling by LLNL; performance and emission testing, and friction reduction by SNL; Computational fluid mechanics and combustion modeling by LANL. This project is a component of the Department of Energy, Office of Utility Technology, National Hydrogen P
rogram. We report here on the progress on the system analysis and preliminary testing. We have done system studies of series hybrid automobiles that approach the PNGV design goal of 34 km/liter (80 mpg), for 384 km (240 miles) and 608 km (380 mi) ranges.
Our results indicate that such a vehicle appears feasible using an optimized hydrogen engine. The impact of various on-board storage options on fuel economy are evaluated.  Initial experiments with neat hydrogen and an available engine at Sandia Combust
ion Research Facility demonstrated NOx emissions of 10 to 20 ppm for an equivalent ratio of 0.4 and about 500 ppm for an equivalent ratio of 0.5. Hybrid vehicle simulation studies indicate that exhaust NOx concentrations must be less than 180 ppm to meet
the 0.2 g/mile California Air Resources Board ULEV or Federal Tier II emissions regulations. Current experiments involve a first generation optimized hydrogen engine consisting of an in-house designed and fabricated cylinder head and an Onan single cyli
nder diesel block. This head currently features 14.8:1 compression ratio, dual ignition, water cooling, two valves and open quiescent combustion chamber to minimize heat transfer losses. Initial testing shows promise of achieving an indicated efficiency o
f 42 to 46% and emissions of less than 100 ppm NOx. Hydrocarbons and CO are to be measured, but are expected to be very low since their only source is engine lubricating oil. A successful friction reduction program on the Onan engine should result in ther
mal efficiency in excess of 40% compared to today's gasoline engine of 32 %. Specific engine data on indicated efficiency, MBT timing and burn duration are reported. Based on system studies requirements, the next generation engine will have a displacement
of about 2 liters and is projected to achieve 46 % brake thermal efficiency with outputs of 15 kW for cruise and 40 kW for hill climb. The concept of the series hybrid includes on-off engine operation mode with all operation taking place at wide open thr
ottle to minimize pumping losses.

This report describes the adaptation of the gaseous fuel injection (GFI) system for natural gas to a heavy duty engine, namely the Cummins L10 240 horsepower engine. The aim of this program was to develop a production worthy, state of the art natural gas
engine control system and to optimize the L10 natural gas engine's performance for low NOx. Two further additional aims of the program were to collect and report methane fraction of total hydrocarbon emissions from the engine over a steady state range of
loads and speeds and collect, analyse and report methane fraction of total hydrocarbons and aldehyde emissions from the engine over the EPA transient cycle. The program was comprised of six tasks or sub-sections (i) GFI Hardware (ii) Theory and Software (

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Wheel motor are widely used in electrical vehicle, because it is a simple structure.  In order to prevent mass (including dust, drip, mud and so on) entering from outside into the electrical motor, the enclosed structure is often used which leads to diffi
culty in cooling.  The merits and demerits of different cooling methods in electrical wheel motor is discussed in this article.  It can be considered that the cooling method with heat pipe has a simple structure, remarkable effect on transferring heat and
no loss of energy in the process of heat transmitting.  This article shows the experiment curves of the wheel motor model with heat pipes for heat transferring.  The experimental results shows that the structure with heat pipes have a good effect on tran
smitting heat in wheel motor.  It can be widely applied in electrical vehicle.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The South Australian energy system was modelled using the MENSA/MARKAL energy model.  Investigations into the energy system as a whole were carried out for the period 1980 to 2010.  Special attention was paid to the natural gas sector since it is the lead
ing indigenous fuel.  The study showed that if plentiful supplies were found then the model would allocate a substantial proportion of natural gas to electricity generation. Also there could be a swing to the use of compressed natural gas for transportati
on in well-populated areas.  In the transportation sector, natural gas could compete with LPG produced from the indigenous gas and oil wells and from the operation of the South Australlian oil refinery system.  (Author abstract

The principle objective of this project was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using hydrous ethanol as a diesel fuel for large trucks, tractors, city buses and machinery used in confined areas and, also, to assess the possible merits of using an
ethanol based diesel fuel in applications as indicated.  The technical program included extensive field testing of 4 city buses, 2 large lorries and 1 agricultural tractor.  The vehicles were equipped with engines featuring either dual injection or use o
f an ignition improver fuel in, basically unchanged, conventional diesel engines.  Field testing began in 1985 and is expected to continue through 1988.  Extensive analysis and characterization of the engine exhaust emissions consistitutes a highly priori
tized task within the technical program. (From author abstract)

A comprehensive examination of the research needed to accelerate the acceptance of compressed natural gas as a vehicle fuel has been conducted.  The technical problems which have limited acceptance but which may be alleviated through research are poorer e
ngine performance and reduced driving range as compared to vehicles using liquid fuels.  A public perception that CNG is not as safe as gasoline for public use has been a problem.  The identified research needs include specific projects which will reduce
or eliminate these problems

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of LPG in transportation within Europe is discussed.  Most European countries depend heavily on outside sources for fuel derived from crude oil.  There is an increased desire within these countries to reduce this dependence by developing alternati
ve sources of automotive fuels.  LPG has become a viable option in some of these countries, i.e. Italy and The Netherlands, and its use is expected to increase.  The rapid development of LPG technology including ease of vehicular conversion and estimation
s of increased LPG availability suggest LPG will soon be recognized as a premium automotive fuel

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report presents a comprehensive set of activities and energy demand projections for each of the major transportation modes and submodes. Prediction are based on the assumption of a continuation of current trends and no new energy conserving programs
beyond currently mandated standards.  Each mode (passenger and freight) and submode is projected independently.  The total transportation energy demand is developed as an aggregate of all the modal and submodal projections.  Some key conclusions reached a
re (a) up to the present time, transportation energy growth has followed Gross National Product growth but this trend will not continue due to the improved efficiency of personal vehicles (b) expected diesel price increases will retard dieselization of th
e medium and heavy truck fleet (c) the stocks of various newly popular personal vehicles (RVs, moped, motorcycles) will grow quickly resulting in increased energy consumption by these modes (d) efficiency improvements in the passenger mode are primarily t
echnological, and on the freight side, primarily based on operational changes

Design and manufacturing of electric cars faces a significant growth all over the world.  More than 200 electric and hybrid vehicle projects are currently under evaluation by 125 companies around the world.  Performance testing was conducted for the estim
ation of the dynamic characteristics of two electric cars with different power trains.  The first car is a prototype mini electric car with a constant drive ratio, and the second is a Fiat Panda Elettra with a manual four-speed gearbox belonging to the Gr
eek Center for Renewable Energy Sources (CRES).  The cars are powered by Lead-Acid batteries and DC series field motors.  Two similar on-board data acquisition systems developed by CRES were used to provide useful insight into the performance characterist
ics of these electric vehicles.

A constant volume bomb was used to determine basic combustion characteristics of iso-octane, n-heptane, methanol, propane and methane.  Results show that the laminar flame velocity of a quiescent homogenous air/fuel mixture can be derived from pressure-ti
me data in the bomb.  The effects of pressure, temperature, and charge dilution on flame velocity  and ignition are presented.  A thermo-chemical kinetic model accurately predicted concentrations of nitric oxide during combustion and in the burned gas. (A
uthor abstract).

New catalytic systems for the purification of automotive exhaust gases and emissions from stationary engines have been developed on pelletized carriers as well as on honeycomb substrates.  The main objective of this research work was to increase the durab
ility of the catalyst and to lower the precious metal loading The crush strength and the attrition resistance of automotive pellet-type catalysts could be increased by 70% or 60% for the fresh catalyst respectively.  These results did not change significa
ntly for the aged catalyst (24 hours, 980 C).  Due to the introduction of a new washcoat technology, the total precious metal loading of honeycomb type catalysts could be lowered by 70% without sacrificing decisive catalytic properties For stationary appl
ications on large diesel engines, the long-term durability of a combination of a DPF (Deisel Particulate filter) with an SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) catalyst was proven.  After 2300 hours   of operation, a particulate reduction of 75% and a NOx re
duction of approximately 85% was achieved (author abstract 5 refs

Three types of rupture discs with fusible plugs were destructively tested. A total of 75 disc assemblies were pressurized to failure at various temperatures between 20C and 250C.  The test procedures are described, and the results are discussed.  Two fail
ure morphologies were observed, with one mode occurring at significantly less pressure than the rated value.  The proportion of acceptable burst pressures varied significantly (16, 58, 100%) between the three types tested

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The objective of this study was to review some of the research done to date on propane substitution's applicability to highway log hauling and to evaluate its potential for reducing logging-truck operating costs.  The economics of propane boosting were al
so examined.  The conclusions of this study indicate that additional laboratory work is required on the TNO propane regulator prior to field testing on a highway logging truck.  Research indicates that there is little potential for reducing logging-truck
operating costs through propane substitution at current propane and diesel prices.  With regard to propane boosting, it is not an economically attractive method for improving engine performance on a new truck.  (From author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A microprocessor engine control system has been developed for a Caterpillar 3208 naturally aspirated engine to allow it to operate on natural gas using diesel pilot injection.  The design criteria used for the control system included maintaining comparabl
e peak pressure and rate of pressure rise when operating on dual-fuel.  The inputs used for the control system include engine speed, load and inlet air temperature.  The maximum diesel substitution level attained was approximately 85%.  The conversion sys
tem consists of three main component groups, a positioning device to control the amount of diesel fuel, a natural gas control valve and a computer control module.  Following completion of the system, the engine was put through a series of performance, tra
nsient and stability tests and the dual-fuel strategy was adjusted to optimize performance.  (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

During the years 1992 and 1993, the number of electric vehicles registered has increased to about 4000 - compared to about 40 M conventional cars.  There are 22 different types offered, mainly small cars from small companies.  The dc motor is still prefer
red, ac motors are offered increasingly.  Mainly Lead-Acid and Lead gel batteries are installed, apart from the big test with modern high performance batteries on the island Rngen in northern Germany.  Battery management systems will be included increasin
gly due to the higher lifetime of the battery as most manufacturers noticed.  There are 102 public charging stations, most of them connected to solar arrays and free of charge for the energy supplied.  12 manufacturers of charging stations offer their pro
ducts on the German market.  On the political side governmental and city institutions hesitate in helping to bring electric vehicles even with slight pushes into the market.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The current and future markets for NGVs, and indeed all non-petroleum fuel alternatives, are being driven by a number of important economic and environmental factors including air pollution, dependence on foreign oil, dependence on gasoline and diesel fue
ls by the transportation sector, and increasingly strict standards for vehicle emissions.  There are five key factors which will influence the nature and speed of NGV commercialization, these are discussed briefly:  technology development, potential emiss
ion reductions, government support for alternate fuels, utility support for NGVs, and policy/standards development.  It is suggested that the nature of natural gas, as both a pollution solution and economically competitive alternate fuel, should make it t
he alternate fuel of choice.  (author summary

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In the 1970's LPG and CNG did not 'take off' in Canada because the level of technology in Canada at the time was primitive, we had little experience with the fuels, an infrastructure did not exist, and good conversion kits were not readily available.  Thi
s paper outlines how R & D development in Canada's NGV industry changed all this, and suggests that if R & D effort stops, Canada will quickly lose touch with the industry again

Large numbers of private vehicles powered by Natural Gas could become a reality, with the development of a small, relatively inexpensive compressor capable of refuelling the family car overnight at home The Natural Gas Vehicle, NGV, has been used by comme
rcial fleet operators for some time.  The general public, however, is largely unaware of this application of Natural Gas.  The domestic use of NGV gas been delayed until now by the absence of suitable refuelling facilities In 1986, research by AGL Sydney
and other gas companies around the world revealed a high level of public interest in NGV, and more importantly, acceptance of NGV and the home refuelling concept The Swiss company SULZER has responded to this market need by developing a relatively inexpen
sive Home Refuelling Appliance especially designed for overnight filling of natural gas storage cylinders fitted to a private car (From author paper

The use of natural gas as a transit bus fuel is being demonstrated by The Hamilton Street Railway Company.  The H.S.R. is a public transit system operating two hundred diesel buses and fifty electric trolley buses.  Six transit buses operating in daily se
rvice using a spark ignited engine dedicated to natural gas fuel.  The buses are used primarily for peak period extra service because of insufficient fuel tank capacity.  The buses have performed well in service and have exhibited few serious fuel related
problems.  The fuel consumption however has been considerably higher than anticipated and a series of valve keeper failures occurred in the latter stages of the project.  (author abstract)  This is the eighth paper in "Gaseous Fuels: Technology, Performa

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

An investigation into the maximum practical use of alcohol with minimum modification in conventional diesel engines has been conducted Two major approaches have been studied; ethanol/diesel fuel blend and forced ignition by pilot injection of diesel fuel.
The diesel engines with three different chambers were used; prechamber, swirl chamber, and open chamber In using blended fuel it is shown that increased ethanol percentage results in increased HC emission and decreased thermal efficiency especially at l
ow load In order to study the optimization of the combustion chamber design for dual fuel injection engine, in-cylinder Schlieren observation was conducted using a swirl chamber head with quartz windows.  A series of engines with this optimized chamber de
sign currently under study is achieving a good efficiency and low pollutant emissions For small percentage substitutions it is estimated that the use of alcohol/diesel fuel blend would be feasible For large percentage substitutions dual fuel injection sys
tem is a promising technology although alcohol fuel prices and material developments remain as obstacles

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The on-board storage capacity of natural gas vehicle (NGVs) is a critical issue to the wide spread marketing of these alternate fueled vehicles. Underfilling of NGV cylinders during fast fill (<5 min) charging operations, can occur at fueling stations, at
ambient temperatures greater than 50 *F or 60 *F. The resulting reduced driving range of the vehicle is a serious obstacle which the gas industry is striving to overcome, without resorting to unnecessarily high fueling station pressures, or by applying e
xtensive overpressurization of the cylinder during the fueling operation. Undercharged storage cylinders are a result of elevated temperature which occurs in the NGV storage cylinder , due to compression and other processes which have not, to the author's
knowledge, been analyzed and documented to date. This paper presents a model and solution methodology which quantifies the cylinder undercharging phenomena which occurs during rapid (<5 min.) fueling. The effects of heat transfer from the cylinder gas
to its constraining walls and ambient are considered in the model analysis. The ramifications of the results on the fueling station and cylinder designs are discussed. Suggestions are made for controlled experimental programs to verify the theoretical res
ults, and fueling station design studies which could minimize or eliminate cylinder underfilling

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The possibility of using natural gas to replace a significant portion of diesel fuel currently being used by railway locomotives in Canada was studied.  An R & D plan was designed as a result of a series of interviews with railways, engine manufacturers,
natural gas conversion and supply organizations and relevant government departments.  An outline of specific research projects which would likely have to be done in order to address the technical, operational, economic and regulatory issues of such a proj
ect is presented

Tightening of the U.S. pollutant emission standards may encourage the development of a dual fuel (natural gas/diesel) market for heavy duty trucks.  Aside from cleaner emissions, a mix of natural gas and diesel fuel will also reduce noise levels in diesel
engines -- another factor facing tougher regulation.  Dual fuel systems currently available for heavy duty trucks are identified and discussed.  The need for improved marketing of alternative fuels such as natural gas is emphasized

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Review is being made of the problems associated with the use of natural gas, notably methane in dual-fuel engines of the compression ignition diesel type.  It is shown that such applications represent a very attractive mode for the utilization of the fuel
for the production of power generally at relatively high efficiencies and outputs with superior emissions characteristics.  Some of the problems associated with such applications are discussed and some relevant solutions outlined

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report discusses a gravimetric method used on solid adsorbents to determine surface excess isotherms of compressed gases.  Compensating the volume of the adsorbent and using a symmetric-beam microbalance will minimize the buoyancy corrections.  Isoth
erms up to 150 bar at -20, 0, 25, and 50 C, which corresponds to bulk densities for methane up to the critical density and for argon more than half the critical density are determined for adsorption of argon and methane onto graphon.  The maximum values o
f surface excess isotherms are about 0.4 to 0.5 of the critical density.  Also mentioned is simple isotherm equations range of applicability for higher gas pressures

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Much of today's work in the battery field is directed toward developing a suitable traction battery for Electric Vehicles.  The primary focus is to develop a battery with a very high specific energy.  However the introduction of Hybrid Electric Vehicles,
which are not limited in range, would need a different type of battery than traditionally used in EVs.  In this paper we will discuss the meaning of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle.  We will specially distinguish between three main classes of series hybrids, th
e Diesel-Electric, the Ping-Pong and the Range Extender type.  The requirements on the battery in those three applications will be discussed and compared with battery technologies of today, for example NiCd and NiMH.  We will find that there is a need to
develop batteries that are specially devoted to the more severe application of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle.  The batteries will have to be improved in power capability, charge acceptance at higher temperatures, be insensitive to incomplete discharge and cha
rge cycles and there is a need of bipolar constructions.

This paper describes the design and testing of a fuel system which vaporizes and dissociates methanol and delivers hydrogen-rich gases to the engine to be burned.  The vaporization and dissociation of methanol absorb heat from the engine exhaust and incre
ase the lower heating value of the fuel by approximately 22%.  Raising the compression ratio and burning with excess air also increases engine thermal efficiency.  Dynamometer tests with dissociated methanol indicate improvements in brake thermal efficien
cy compared to gasoline of up to 50% depending on engine speed and torque.  Potential technical and economic advantages of applying this concept to combustion turbines are discussed.  An outline of experimental programs recently initiated verify the resul

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In this paper the history and current status of the Canadian market for compressed natural gas as a vehicle fuel is reviewed, and key problems and opportunities in the current marketplace are discussed.  The CNG industry in Canada today is based predomina
ntly on public refuelling from an expanded network of stations.  Conversion sales are the key to continued market growth.  The viability of strong and technically capable suppliers, continued growth in the network of fuelling stations, continued and stabl
e government support, commercialization of new product developments, and overall market growth are current issues in the Canadian market.  (From author summary)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A novel, one-step process selectively removes hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from sour gases and converts dissolved H2S directly to sulfur in a bubble tower filled with a sweetener solution.  Oxidation of the H2S to sulfur is achieved by a liquid-phase oxidation
technique.  Benefits of the one-step process include good cost-efficiency, simplicity of operation and low toxicity of the slurry generated by the H2S reaction.  This process is being used successfully in 12 states in the United States and several units a
re under construction for use in Canada

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Electric vehicles represent a complete different technology compared with internal combustion engines.  This means that new safety hazards, mainly related to the characteristics of high-power electric equipment, may be present. The electric vehicle sy
stem shall be designed to operate safely in all conditions; a number of specific problems will be treated  concentrating on aspects of vehicle behaviour which are typical for electric vehicles.  At this moment the standard and offical regulations concerni
ng electric road vehicles are not very clearly defined.  The existing documents and standards are far from harmonised, and they cover a vehicle in full technological evolution.  Another aspect is the psychological awareness of these "new" risks: the prese
nce of high voltages or of battery chemicals may used as an argument against electric vehicles; the fact that internal-combustion-engined vehicles present large risks too is often overlooked, people having get used to the danger.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The engine performance, fuel economy and emissions of an AVL research engine using natural gas, hydrogen-supplemented natural gas and hydrogen are analyzed This evaluation was undertaken because of the future requirement for hydrogen supplementation and e
ventual replacement of a rapidly diminishing natural gas resource for stationary type combustion engines.  The differences in the combustion properties, knock rating, engine performance and emissions of methane (the chief constituent of natural gas) and h
ydrogen are significant In addition to the performance results it was determined that problems of preignition, flashback and high nitric oxide emissions for a hydrogen fueled engine can be solved by water induction into the intake manifold

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper will discuss the VRA's advantages verses larger compressors, its complementary role in the overall NGV refuelling infrastructure, its use as a system and key end user applications.  The predominant end user benefits are emphasized in a comparis
on of the VRA to large, traditional natural gas compressors: low cost, convenience and installation flexibility. An overview of the FuelMaker VRA demonstrates how refuelling can be accomplished both outdoors and indoors and can facilitate multi vehicle, t
ime fill and fast applications. The VRA's product positioning is discussed as well as its market segments and the factors which affect end user buying decisions.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Findings of an earlier study indicate that interior surfaces of propane cylinders have an apparent bearing on odorant fade.   This paper briefly examines causes and solutions to this problem.  Conventional heat treating in the manufacturing of cylinders o
ften results in a thick porous iron-oxide film being deposited on the inside surface of the cylinder which causes rapid odorant fade. Tests indicate that minimizing the length of time that the cylinder is heated and minimizing the oxygen in the cylinde du
ring the heating process will result in a non-reactive surface.  By usin alternative processes, i.e. by using an induction furnace that is blankete with inert gas or employing other simple, inexpensive tricks, it is possibl to make cylinders that do not c
ause odorant fade.  Aluminum cylinders woul be ideal for the purpose, however they continue to be too expensive.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (EMR) has identified methanol as a potential component of the transportation fuel pool in Canada. Methanol is an alternative fuel to gasoline and diesel which can be produced from Canada's vast natural gas res
ources or alternatively, from coal or biomass.In late 1983, the Transportation Energy Division of Energy, Mines and Resources retained the Bureau of Management Consulting (BMC) to provide energy policy makers with an analysis of the various factors whic
h must be considered when developing and introducing policies related to the introduction of methanol into Canada's road transportation sector. In September 1984, BMC produced the first phase report "The possible Use of Methanol Blends For Canada's Road's
Vehicles, A Policy Oriented Analysis". That report addressed the issues and policy options associated with the near-term blended fuels market. This report "The Status of Neat Methanol Fuel For Canada's Road Vehicles" presents the findings of the findin
gs of the second phase and provides a "state-of-art" review of the neat methanol fuel option. This analysis is based upon an extensive survey/critical review of the relevant literature, and discussions with the key governmental and relevant literature, an
d discussions with the key governmental and private sector personnel in the transportation and fuels industry.

This report covers the measurement of piston temperature in a natural gas-fueled 7.4 liter engine.  The project was funded as part of GRI's Gas Fueled Internal Combustion Engine Advancements.  A test engine purchased from TECOGEN was turbocharged to provi
de 300 horsepower at 3600 rpm.  Piston temperature data was obtained at various engine conditions at seven locations on one piston.  A short test with oil spray piston cooling showed little benefit from piston cooling at low oil flow rates.  (author abstr

Lithium Battery Energy Storage Technology Research Association (LIBES) has been conducting the research and development on "Dispersed Battery Energy Storage Technology" of the national New Sun-Shine Project of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technolo
gy (AIST), Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) since FY-1992.   Main target is the research and development of 20-30 kWh class high performance ambient temperature Lithium secondary batteries of long-life type and high energy density type.
The Lithium batteries of long life type is to be applied to small scale load-leveling system for home use, and high energy density type is to be applied to electric vehicle.  For these usage, it is necessary to improve energy density up to 1.5-2.0 times
of the performance of existing commercial-base Lithium-ion battery.Therefore, the basic research to improve the performance of cathode materials, anode materials, electrolyte materials and others is conducted by ten companies assigning to LIBES.  10 Wh
-class cells using LiCoO2, LiNiO2, LiMn2O4 is going to be fabricated and tested at the first interim evaluation test in FY-1995.This paper describes the ouline of national project and current research results.

SEMT PIELSTICK developed since 1971 a range of medium speed dual fuel engines with relatively high air fuel ratios which enables ratings similar to the diesel engines The PC 2.3 DF.C of 1971 was developed up to 535 hp/cyl. and was followed by the PC 2.5 D
F.C of 600 hp/cyl.  This later engine was applied in the West German cogeneration plan of a textile factory giving more than 82% use of primary energy.  This engine is equally used as pollution abating machine because it sniffs toxic solvent vapors which
are burned in the engine, reducing furthermore the apparent (paid) energy consumption.  Thanks to the lean air-gas mixture, the very severe West German limits on pollution could be fulfilled without any extra depolluting device The newest development is t
he PA 5 DF engine of the same philosophy which will cover the 1000 to 3600 kw range (author abstract 4 refs

As natural gas becomes more accepted as a vehicle fuel, and technology for utilizing the gas as a direct substitute for gasoline becomes better and more available, there is growing interest among natural gas marketers to become involved in this growing in
dustry.  This paper discusses the natural gas industry, particularly as it exists in Canada.  It explores the role of the natural gas distribution utility in the present environment.  The findings indicate a substantial opportunity for gas sales, investme
nt, and revenue growth which with government encouragement, and effort on the part of the utility, should provide a strong market for natural gas distributors

Solid-state electrochemical technology, embodied in the IGR deNOx process is used to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen, and thereby control NOx emissions from natural gas powered engines.  The IGR deNOx process is based on solid-state, flow th
rough, high surface area, oxygen ion conductive ceramic electroyltes.  The technical feasibility of the IGR deNOx control technology has been demonstrated by scaling up the amount of NO decomposition 100 fold over precontract work.  Ceramic reactor elemen
ts made of fully stabilized zirconia (yttria stabilized) have been coated with porous silver electrodes, and tested with NO gas mixtures including a mixture containing CO2, H20, and N2 using both electrical and gas chromatographic analysis.  The reactor e
lements were tested over a range of 0 and 1.2 volts at temperatures of up to 650 degrees C.  Reaction rates of up to 10 mg/min of NO per reactor element have been measured.  The process economics compare favorably with other post combustion flue gas treat
ments such as selective catalytic reduction and nonselective catalyti reduction.  (Author Abstract)

The Ontario Research Foundation (ORF) was contracted by the Canadian Gas Association (CGA) to perform durability testing of a Chrysler 5.2 L engine. The object was to determine if natural gas (NG) is a suitable automotive fuel from the standpoint of engin
e wear. Testing involved 200 hours of operation on propane to provide baseline wear measurements, followed by 200 hours of similar operation on natural gas for a direct wear comparison. Chrysler Canada participated in the program through supply of a dedic
ated propane engine, extra cylinder heads and engineering support.Limited availability contact Kelly Darby of Gas Technology CanadaTel. (416) 449 4311 Fax (416) 449 4999

The New Zealand compressed natural gas (CNG) industry has developed from almost zero in 1979 to where almost 100,000 vehicles are using the fuel. This has been accomplished by a diverse range of businesses with hitherto no common interests and with very s
ubstantial government support.  The paper will trace the development of the CNG programme with particular emphasis on how the programme evolved in response to market and industry needs and expectations.  The changing roles and perceptions of the programme
participants will also be explored.  (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Prompted by the ruptures of two fully-wrapped Comdyne cylinders in NGV service, several issues concerning the long-term integrity of composite-wrapped designs were investigated. A performance test for use in cylinder standards was developed for determinin
g the resistance of cylinder designs to the stress rupture phenomenon. The ability of acoustic emission testing to detect damage in the composite wrap of fully-wrapped glass-fibre cylinders was demonstrated. The accelerated pressure cycle testing of all-c
omposite (plastic-lined) cylinders using compressed natural gas was investigated. The ability of various protective coating systems to perform under NGV service conditions and protect glass-fibre wrapped cylinders from environmental attack was reviewed. F
inally, research activities initiated in North America as a result of the Comdyne failures were summarized.To order a copy of this report at cost of $25 contact Kelly Darby of Gas Technology Canada Tel. (416) 449-4311Fax (416) 449-4999

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Argonne National Laboratory has completed three full years of operation of 19 vehicles in the Federal Methanol Fleet Project; ten of the vehicles are fueled with M85 (85% methanol; 15% unleaded gasoline).  Nearly 675,000 miles have been accumulated on the
fleet vehicles so far, and comparisons of energy efficiency continue to show nearly equal performance between the methanol and gasoline vehicles.  Emissions tests have revealed evidence of degradation of emission control systems for both the methanol and
gasoline vehicles.  Methanol vehicles continued to require more maintenance than the gasoline vehicles, and maintenance labor intensity increased for all the vehicle types being monitored.  Metal accumulation rates in lubricating oil of the methanol vehi
cles continued to be elevated compared to that of the gasoline vehicles.  Driver satisfaction in the third year was unchanged, with the gasoline vehicles generally being rated slightly higher than the methanol vehicles.  (author abstract

To project and enhance air quality in the Lower Frazer Valley area, the Province of British Columbia has established the AirCare program, an annual registration-enforced motor vehicle emissions inspection and maintainance (I/M) program for light-and mediu
m-duty vehicles. Heavy -duty gasoline vehicles (HDGVs) and heavy-duty Diesel-powered vehicles (HDDVs) were not initially included in the AirCare program because of differences in the facilities needed to test them and because many heavy duty vehicles oper
ating in the area were believed to be registered in other provinces or the United States, and would, therefore, not be inspected under a registration-based program.

This report covers a visit to Burma by ESCAP consultants J. Stephenson and W. Shiells to hold a CNG workshop and to study and advise on local CNG activities.  The Myanma Oil Corporation in Burma provided the base facilities and organised the workshop, whi
ch ran from 10-14 February.  On 14 February, Shiells returned to New Zealand, while Stephenson was taken on a tour in the Mandalay - Pagan area arranged by Myanma Oil.  This lasted from 15-18 February and was followed by further discussions and advisory a
ctivities in Chauk and Rangoon.  Stephenson left Rangoon to return to New Zealand via Bangkok on 21 February.  A debriefing session was held at ESCAP on 23 February (author introduction 3 appends

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Nitric oxide concentrations in a portion of the exhaust of a diesel engine operated with equivalence ratios between 0.25 and 0.75 were reduced by up to 98% by the addition of cyanuric acid.  The cyanuric acid was combined with the exhaust gas in an electr
ically heated quartz flow reactor.  The effects of the key process parameters (temperature, exhaust gas composition and residence time and the overall engine equivalence ratio) on NO reduction by cyanuric acid were investigated Nitric oxide reduction was
evident at flow reactor temperatures above 700K. The maximum nitric oxide reduction varied from 80% for a reactor temperature of 1180 K and an engine equivalence ratio of 0.25 to 98% for a temperture of 1120 K and an equivalence ratio of 0.75.  The temper
ature range over which 60% or greater nitric oxide reduction was obtained was 1100 to 1340 K.  Increasing the exhaust gas carbon monoxide concentration lowered the required reactor temperature and increased the temperature range for significant nitric oxi
de reduction.  (author abstract 12 refs

Without accurate pressure regulation it is difficult, and costly, to obtain low emissions and good performance benefits from NGV. This paper discusses; a unique pressure regulator family intended to cover most NGV applications,. Critical features needed f
or fuel injection and carburetor systems, and durability. Test results are given for standard NGV regulators and Sherex/OPW's two and three stage pressure regulators. This paper concludes that precision pressure regulation is a cost effective method for b
oth NGV converters and the OEM to obtain low emissions and good performance.

This paper deals with Indian experience in the field of NGV operations. A wide variety of topics are introduced: natural gas distributing activities, diversification into NGV projects, regulatory authorities, certification tests, retrofitted fitted vehicl
es, conversion kit safety and performance, refuelling station networks, and promotion of the CNG industry in India. The paper concludes that the NGV program in India is a small success story so far. However, NGV's are here to stay in India and will occupy
a pivotal role in the transportation scene.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper discusses the research, development and implementation of compressed natural gas (CNG), a wholly indigenous alternative transport fuel, in New Zealand.  The New Zealand Energy Research and Development Committee launched an 18-month assessment p
rogram in late 1977 to determine the suitability of CNG as an automotive fuel for fleet vehicles.  Significant average power losses of about 10 to 30 percent were experienced with CNG operation.  It was found that exhaust emissions were reduced while incr
easing engine efficiency and fuel economy.  Also discussed is limited vehicle range which is a major obstacle to widespread CNG use, safety aspects of CNG, applicability of CNG to New Zealand, fleets that are suitable for conversion, and potential gasolin
e savings

This paper explores the future of natural gas as a major source of energy. The need for an adequate resource base is of major importance, but its existence can be threatened by price restraints, over-regulation and excessive taxation.  An attempt is made
to identify the potential for recoverable natural gas.  In addition to conventional resources, the unconventional, i.e., coal, peat gasification, biomass and wastes, and other sources of natural gas are identified and explained.  Finally, there is an intr
oduction to new markets for natural gas and developments which have taken place in the last few years, particularly the use of NG as a vehicular fuel

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Natural gas is a valuable commodity produced as a by-product of oil drilling in many parts of the world.  Using this commodity essentially requires that problems associated with its low specific gravity be overcome.  One possible application is for vehicu
lar propulsion in localities close to the gas deposit.  This paper reviews the major advantages and disadvantages of this course of action

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper, presented at the 1991 Windsor Workshop on Alternative Fuels (Toronto, Ontario; June 24 - 26, 1991), presents results from Phase I of the Auto/Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program.  The material presented is for overhead projection and
reviews results showing the effects of gasoline aromatic, olefin, oxygenate (MTBE) and sulfur contents, and ninety percent distillation temperature on exhaust mass emissions of regulated (HC, CO, NOx) emissions from current (1989) and older (1983-85) mode
l vehicles.  The effects of these fuel factors (except sulfur) on mass emissions of air toxics (benzene, 1,3 butadiene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde) are also described.  Initial air quality modeling results, showing the impacts of reformulated gasoline
s on ozone in Los Angeles, New York and Dallas-Fort Worth in the years 2005 and 2010, will be discussed.  The presentation concludes with a brief review of what remains to be done in Phase I, and what is planned for Phase II.  (from author abstract

In 1987, at a meeting of the Australian Minerals and Energy Council held in Canberra, Ministers discussed the issue of the impending decline in Australian liquid fuel self-sufficiency and the need to review and evaluate alternative fuel systems.  A workin
g group was established to review the implications of this decline and the relative costs and benefits of alternative fuel options.  This paper represents the findings of the working group

Markets for natural gas vehicles in the U.S. will only grow if research and development of technologies are supported by both the federal government and the gas industry.  With prices currently depressed gasoline ranges from only 25 to 45 cents more than
natural gas, which does not encourage the general public to undergo the expense of having their vehicles converted.  Emphasis is needed on marketing to those with large fleets and high gas consumption, and conversions of vehicles owned by the government a
nd large utilities would promote this

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

An interview was conducted among commercial fleet managers regarding vehicle conversion; their awareness levels, experience with conversion, and attitudes of both the converted and non-converted manager.  It was discovered that converted managers are quit
e knowledgeable on the subject as a whole and tend to be sold on its benefits.  The knowledge of the non-converted manager however, varies from complete unawareness to a very detailed awareness.  The majority of managers with conversion experience are ple
ased with the switch to CNG or propane.  There is some resistance to further conversions in some areas however.  Some of the reasons for this include fears that gasoline prices will fall and propane prices will rise, the economic downturn has caught many
in a cash flow sqeeze, and in Quebec a provincial tax on propane and falling gas prices eliminated incentive for further conversions.  The lack of alternative fuel stations is also considered a problem.  This survey covers concerns and attitudes held by f
leet managers on the subject of vehicle conversion

In Osaka, a community system was constructed and it has been studied from 1993 to 1994.  This system was set up for the promotion of electric vehicle, and was made up of 10 Quick-Recharging Stations and 126 electric vehicles.  These Quick-Recharging Stati
ons have an ability to recover 50 percent of a battery capacity in approximate 30 minutes, and are set for the co-operative use.  These electric vehicles have been lent to various enterprises in urban area.  This time, we introduce the results of "Electri
c Vehicle community System Activity" in Osaka.

A center for environmental technique and healthy living is being created at a location about 7 km from the center of Goteburg. S:t Jorgen hospital, a psychiatric hospital surrounded by a large park, run by the County Council was shutting down and a consor
tium consisting of three building firms, two housing firms (one of them owned by the City of Goteborg) and the County Council acquisited the area and its buildings. The idea was to develop the area to a "center for environmental technique and health care"
called S:t Jorgen Park. Fully developed the area will have 644 dwellings and 72000 m2 of other premises. About 2000 persons will live or work in the area. The starting point in the project is a society in ecological balance where cycling of energy and re
sources is central. The S:t Jorgen environmental project aims at creating possibilities for complex environmental research in a wide perspective. Houses and activities within the area should use as little of the stored natural resources as possible and ha
ve a minimal environmental effect. To achieve this broad coorperation is needed between the City of Goteborg, trade and industry, universities, and national research councils working towards a common objective. The aim is to make S:t Jorgen into a nationa
l and international pilot project in urban environmental planning.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A compressed natural gas (CNG) truck based on the Isuzu "Flf" 2 ton model NKR58 has been developed in a joint effort by Isuzu Motors Limited and Tokyo Gas Company Limited. Using the diesel truck as the base vehicle, optimization and modification has been
made for using natural gas. This paper reports the results of the engine bench test in the stage development. Three test engines with the same bore and stroke were compared with diesel, CNG and gasoline fuels. Engine dynamometer tests have revealed that t
he CNG engine has a potential for leaner air fuel ratio, higher EGR rate and lower NOx emissions. Another test indicates that because of natural gas's high anti knocking potential its power output is greater than that of a comparable IDI diesel engine at
the same level of full load fuel consumption.

This is the final report of a project undertaken by Inland Gas to report on their experiences with a CNG fueling station, and a mixed vehicle fleet, over a two year period.  Inland undertook the active promotion and marketing of natural gas as a vehicle f
uel, and provided the technical support for both fueling and vehicle conversions in the Kamloops area.  This report details problems and experiences they had while building and operating the fueling station, and while converting and maintaining the test v
ehicle fleet.  Inland plans to continue its involvement in retail fueling both at Kamloops, and in other areas in which they have identified potential markets.  They also intend to expand their marketing efforts to attract other major fleet vehicle owners
in their area

This paper presents the fundamentals of dual fuel engine technology.   The dual fuel engine was developed in the early 1900's.  It was used in areas with abundant supplies of gaseous fuel to reduce the fuel costs below that of diesel alone.  The increase
in availability of diesel fuel, plus improved engine technology, decreased the popularity of the dual-fuel engine until now, when the present petroleum situation once again makes it a viable alterative

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Electronically controlled direct injection of gaseous fuels -- natural gas and hydrogen, is proposed for diesel engines.  This results in several new concepts:  semicryogenic tanks for gas storage, gas conditioning chamber for gas preheating, gas injectio
n systems with solenoid operated injectors interfaced with a metering valve operated by a digital actuator and the gas ignition supporting devices based on resonance tube, gas preheating, etc.  Feasibility of some of the proposed concepts has already been
experimentally confirmed.  The development of the complete system should lead to more efficient use of gaseous fuels in the combustion engine.  (Author abstract)

Although compressed natural gas has proven itself on ecological, economic, and strategic advantages as an automotive fuel, there have been difficulties with providing easy-to-use equipment for public refueling stations.  This paper discusses some of the p
roblems involved with current dispensing equipment and suggests possible solutions.  The Cubogas packaged modular station is identified as an example of the most up-to-date technology in this area

The World Bank Energy Division has developed a handbook which evaluates the feasibility of natural gas use for transportation in various developing countries.  Even with falling oil prices the economic benefits of CNG or LNG use are still attractive.  Cou
ntries that would be most likely to have successful NGV markets should have a low-cost local supply of natural gas, the gas must be utilized in all possible markets and the vehicle fleet must be large and localized

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In 1991/1992, the Federal Office of Energy launched the Promotion Programme "Lightweight Electric Vehicles" to further programme is the replacement of 8% of all ICEVs in Switzerland by EVs by the year 2010.  For the requirement of the project, the communi
ties must have 5,000 - 20,000 inhabitants.  Out of 34 communities applied for the programme, five were chosen for further considerations.  One of these five communities was chosen for the full support of the programme which covered up to 50% of the EV cos
t.  The total budget of this programme is estimated at more than 20 M US$.  All the producers of the Lightweight  electric vehicles in this programme will be involved as the Danish City-Com and Kewet, the French manufacturers as Ligier, Jeanneau Microcar,
Erad, SEER, the German Hotzenblitz etc.  The Swiss fleet testing programme will convey the use of EVs and supercars to a wide public.  It is a platform for studies concerning the application and spreading of EVs, lightweight EVs and supercars in the
future.  The detailed project and the selected communities will be presented in December 1994.

This report presents the size of the existing (1985) target market, using the latest deails available on the North Island vehicle fleet (December 1985), the latest available data on conversion numbers (August 1985), and information from the 1984 CNG marke
t survey In 1984, 85% of all vehicles in the North Island were in the major and secondary urban areas.  The market survey results and the North Island vehicle fleet statistics indicated at that time 67% private vehicles and 65% of business vehicles were n
ear CNG (i.e. within 5km).  Updated fleet figures indicate total North Island vehicle numbers have increased by 3.2% (1,082,545 cars in 1984 to 1,117,173 cars in 1985).  The number of vehicles within 5km of CNG has risen by 15% (704,420 cars within 5km of
CNG in 1984 to 812,500 in December 1985) (Author introduction

This technical memorandum is part of a series of the Alternative Fuels Development plan sponsored by Energy, Mines and Resources Canada.  This project deals primarily on the processing of coal to provide a synthetic crude hydrocarbon liquid which can be u
pgraded and refined to produce gasoline, diesel fuel and other finished hydrocarbon products.  Areas discussed concern the main steps in the production processes, including issues involved in processing the feedstock.  The prospects for synthetic hydrocar
bon liquids and future developments are also covered

This paper contains the results of a study to evaluate propane as a low-pollution fuel and to provide information on engine adjustment for improving exhaust emissions.  A single cylinder CFR engine was used to study the influence of air-fuel ratio on exha
ust emissions.  A production model automobile engine and three production vehicles were used to study the potential of propane as a low-emission vehicle.  Results in this study showed that engines using propane as compared with gasoline can operate over a
wider range of A/F with minimum carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Propane and natural gas emission levels were similar.  No significant difference in nitrogen oxides was found for the three fuels.  In simulated typical city driving using propane
as a fuel, emissions were markedly reduced by retarding ignition timing with A/F increased to approach the lean misfire limit.  However, serious power loss accompanies engine adjustment for minimum emissions

This paper focuses on vehicles especially designed to operate on a fuel containing at least 85 volume percent methanol.  Some of the issues covered include health effects, toxicity, safety, emissions and economics of using methanol as a vehicular fuel.  I
t is believed that methanol has considerable potential as a motor vehicle fuel but that research is required to resolve problems which might arise from its use

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Methanol has been examined as an alternative fuel for diesel engines in order to reduce particulate emissions.  To reduce the need for adaptation of the diesel engine, ignition-promoting additives for methanol have been studied for the last year.  A Ricar
do single-cylinder diesel engine was operated successfully on methanol with both corn cob- and lignin-derived ignition promotors.  Costs of the full additive process were estimated, on a preliminary basis, to add up to as little as $0.05/gallon of finishe
d product

A new frame structure for an EV named "the battery builtin frame (BBF)" is proposed and tested.  The BBF utilizes the vacant space under the flower where a muffler and a propeller shaft is located in an ICE car.  The BBF is composed of hollow beams made o
f Aluminum extrusions.  Special shape batteries are inserted in the hollow beams.  The  90 mm height, 2600 mm wheel base and 1540 mm with BBF whose Aluminum thickness is 2mm can bear the 6000 kg localized load.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The ignition delay period in dual fuel engines is examined, while employing the gaseous fuels methane, propane, ethylene and hydrogen.  It is shown that the changes due to gaseous fuel admissions in the temperature and pressure levels durring the delay pe
riod, the extent of energy releases due to preignition reaction processes, variations in the parameters of external transfer to the surroundings and the contribution of residual gases are the most inportant factors that determine the ignition delay charac
teristics of dual fuel engines.  The consequences of these factors on the observed values of the ignition delay were evaluated while using detailed reaction kinetics for the xidation of the gaseous fuel and employing an experimentally based formula for th
e ignition of the liquid pilot.  It is then suggested that the ignition delay in dual fuel engine operation, in principle can be correlated in terms of the type of gaseous fuel employed, its concentration and other operating conditions.  (from Author's ab

Hybrid fuels, which are derived from combinations of different energy sources, are generally formulated as solutions, emulsions, or slurries.  A number of hybrid fuels have been developed and tested in a direct injection single-cylinder diesel engine to d
etermine the possibility of reducing the use of petroleum derived fuels and/or to minimize the processing requirements of the finished hybrid products.  The hybrid formations tested included solutions of ethanol and methanol and vegetable oils in diesel f
uel; emulsions of methanol and of ethanol in diesel fuel; and slurries of starch, cellulose and carbon in diesel fuel.  The solutions and emulsions could prove to be viable diesel engine fuels if a number of criteria are met.  Slurries however, are not ye
t to the same point of development

The Ontario Research Foundation was contracted by the Canadian Gas Association to perform durability testing of a Chrysler 5.2 L engine.  The object was to determine if natural gas is a suitable automotive fuel from the standpoint of engine wear.  Testing
involved 200 hours of operation on propane to provide baseline wear measurements, followed by 200 hours of similar operation on natural gas for a direct wear comparison.  Chrysler Canada participated in the program through supply of a dedicated propane e
ngine, extra cylinder heads and engineering support.  (Author Abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A fully electronic dual fuel natural gas/diesel conversion system has been developed for the Catterpillar 3406 diesel engine with PEEC eletronic engine control. This system is microprocessor based, and interfaces with the Caterpillar PEEC system to allow
control of diesel injection timing as well as fuel quantity. Control of injection timing allows pilot fuel levels as low as 3 % at full load, however, to ensure good transient response, minimum pilot level is about 10 %. The completed system has similar p
erformance to the diesel engine, with comparable efficiency at full load. Furthermore, the engine's governing characteristics are similar on dual fuel or diesel only operation. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon exhaust emissions are higher than on diesel, p
articularly at light load, while oxides of nitrogen emissions are lower.Limited availability contact Kelly Darby of Gas Technology Canada Tel.(416) 449 4311   Fax (416) 449 4999

The objects of this paper were to determine how much of the power loss associated with dual fuel operation of a spark ignition engine could be recovered using natural gas a a dedicated fuel; what improvements in thermal efficiency could be obtained; and,
by how much the limited range obtained with gaseous storage might be alleviated.  Tests were conducted on a 6 cylinder 3.3 litre engine coupled to a Heenan and Froude DPX3 dynamometer.  It was concluded that it is possible to optimize a gaseous fuel burni
ng engine, by raising the compression ratio, application of a correctly designed and calibrated Venturi gas/air mixer with an appropriate control system, and optimum spark schedule employed

Modern agriculture relies essentially on a safe and reasonably priced energy supply.  In some cases, the waste of agricultural production may be upgraded to apropriate fuels so that they can provide the energy needs of the industry as well as commercial f
uels to be integrated into the regional or national energy policy.  One such instance appears in the sisal fibre industry, a major export crop in several developing countries.  The study aiming at the conversion of sisal waste to fuels started in 1981 and
the priority was first given to the production of alcohol fuels.  Modification in the economy of fibre production, efficiency and chemical considerations and the perspectives of a market for the product allowed a reconsideration of the production of biog
as on a larger scale.  Biogas may also be economically utilized as a sisal processing and as a transportation fuel.  The paper surveys the technology of gas production from sisal waste and the biogas potential as transportation and process fuel in the sis
al producing regions of Tanzania.  The geographical pattern of the distribution and the size of the demand are taken into consideration. Comparison with the alcohol alternative is performed and gross criteria are set up for the characterization of alterna
tive fuels in terms of their application.  (From author abstract

Recent interest in alternative fuels for light-duty highway vehicles is based on their potential to address three important societal problems:  unhealthy levels of ozone in major urban areas; growing U.S. dependence on imported petroleum; and rising emiss
ions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  This report examines the following alternative fuels:  methanol, ethanol, natural gas, electricity, hydrogen and reformulated gasoline.  It discusses cost/benefits associated with the use of each (from s

Road trials in New Zealand and elsewhere have proved the technical feasibility of running existing diesel engines on methanol or ethanol plus Avocet.  It is expected that the road trials being undertaken in the USA will confirm the reductions in particula
te and NOX emissions which have been achieved in bench tests.  Widespread replacement of diesel by Avocet/Methanol on purely economic grounds requires an increase in oil prices or the development of new methanol production technology.  Until one of these
happens a case can be made for replacement of diesel by Avocet/Methanol in situations where the environmental benefits can be maximized, i.e. urban fleet vehicles. (From author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper provides an overview of a trip taken by Bernard James, Energy, Mines and Resources Canada, and Malcolm Smith, B.C. Research, to New Zealand (and to a smaller extent Australia) to meet with individuals, companies and agencies involved in natural
gas vehicle (NGV) markets.  The objectives of the trip included:  the setting up of formal informational exchanges between the R&D Groups in both countries; an examination of their work on the operation of diesel engines using natural gas; an investigati
on on the interaction between industry and government; and, an evaluation of the reported changes in the rate of new vehicle conversions following the introduction of less attractive government assistance programs in 1985

A new process for North America, with a proven performance track record in Europe since 1983 - the CER-NOx Process.  The CER-NOx Process for the selective catalytic reduction of (SCR) of NOx has been developed through a joint effort of Mobil Chemical Comp
any, Chemical Products Division and Steuler Industriewerke GmbH, West Germany using ceramic molecular sieve (SCR) catalyst modules.  The CER-NOx process is overcoming many of the field problems encountered with heavy/noble metal type catalysts introduced
approximately 10 years ago in Japan and the USA and can be combined with volatile organic compound (VOC) and sulfur oxide abatement systems This paper presents the urgent need for NOx reduction based on European reearch on cause and effect of dying forest
s, wild life, lakes and coastal areas.  Also, presented is the CER-NOx (SCR) NOx abatement process, including cost data and co-generation applications (author abstract 6 refs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Testbed trials of the Sulzer RTA84 dual-fuel engine were successfully completed at the IHI Aioi engine works (Japan) in April 1986.  This newly developed engine-type, output range 15 to 40 MW, can be operated with both diesel or heavy oil and methane gas
at comparable thermal efficiency and unchanged output.  The RTA dual-fuel engine was developed in close collaboration between Sulzer Brothers Ltd., Switzerland, and its Japanese licensees, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. (IHI).  Intended for the
propulsion of LNG carriers, which the boil-off gas from the ships cargo is exploited or for the generation of electricity in stationary plants, the RTA dual-fuel engine is an economic and reliable alternative to the steam or gas turbine. (Author abstract.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The crashworthiness of CNG storage tank mounts was evaluated.  Three bracket designs were tested statically, and results were compared to forces which would be experienced in 50 km/hr vehicular impacts.  Also tested, were floor panels from six common dome
stic trucks, vans and passenger vehicles.  These were evaluated to determine their ability to structurally support the tank brackets when the vehicle is involved in 50 km/hr impacts All of the brackets tested were adequately strong.  Some deformed signifi
cantly before developing a sufficiently large resisting force.  To avoid severing of the fuel line in these situations it is recommended that the flexibility of the fuel line routing should match the designed impact flexibility of the tank.  It was also f
ound that the vehicle floors were adequately strong if backed with large (7.5 cm square) washers at each hold-down bolt

Work has been carried out by a team at the Royal Military College, Kingston, Ontario, under a programme directed by the Ontario Provincial government.  New types of charcoal materials have been developed to store compressed natural gas by adsorption at mo
derate pressure.  The materials are made using polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) which is shaped into blocks and pyrolysed in a controlled heating process which retains the shape of the blocks. The shaped blocks fill the cylinder with a minimum of wasted voi
d space, unlike powdered or granular charcoals, and have a high micropore volume suited to retaining the small methane molecule. It is hoped that storage of gas at moderate pressures (e.g. 500 psi) will eventually make home refuelling possible with lighte
r and less expensive compressors than are now needed for full pressure storage at 3000 psi.  (From author abstract

Stabilized fuels containing methanol or ethanol, contamination water, and chemical stabilizer were evaluated in an ASTM cetane rating engine and commercial Direct (DI) and Indirect (IDI) injection engines.  Engine speed and load conditions were selected t
o provide adequate smoke and particulate emissions for accurate measurements.  All fuels were tested at equal energy input rates for the given engine The cetane engine results were quite variable compared to those from the other engines.  For operation wi
th the stabilized fuels:  All three engines demonstrated only minor changes in HC, CO, and NOx emissions and engine efficiency.  The cetane engine demonstrated very little change in the smoke and particulate emissions; the DI engine showed substantial red
uction in smoke and particulates; and the IDI engine showed a consistent but smaller reduction in smoke and particulates.  The Soluble Organic Fraction of the particulate emissions increased significantly for the stabilized fuels operating in the DI engin
e.  This increase was not as pronounced for the IDI engine.  Fuel related operational problems are also described

H Power Corporation and its contractor team have developed a methanol-fueled, phosphoric acid fuel cell powered transit bus under a cost-shared U.S. Department of Energy contract.  This bus is energy efficient and produces virtually no noxious emissions.
The first of three 30-foot test-bed buses to be produced under this contract was successfully rolled-out and extensively demonstrated during 1994.  It has been undergoing a rigorous engineering test program at a U.S. Army facility, and results (e.g. acce
leration performance) have been encouraging with respect to project objectives.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report quantifies potential regional and seasonal variations in the composition and physical properties of natural gas particularly as they might impact stationary engines and natural gas vehicles. Over 6800 gas analyses were obtained from 26 major u
rban areas located in 19 states and each of the major geographical regions of the U.S.. The report also includes two related studies: A study of peakshaving practices indicated that the composition of send out gases can be significantly affected by the ad
dition of propane air mixtures or vaporized liquefied natural gas. A study of hydrocarbon dew points indicated that the gaseous fuels with higher concentrations of heavier hydrocarbons have a greater likelihood of condensing those heavy hydrocarbons under
certain conditions of temperature and pressure.

The Province of B.C., with its wide variety of energy resources and expertise, has a real opportunity to play a significant role in the development of these resources in a way that will spin off new technologies and marketable expertise.  There are severa
l specific opportunities where more planning, effort and financial support would yield considerable benefits.  The basic thrust of the committee's recommendations deals with both the resources and the expertise, namely l)  Significant planning and funding
should be put in place to pursue the research into the natural gas vehicle and engine 2)  More money and coherent support should be available for the curiosity driven scientific research into energy.  Herein lies the basic training ground for the next ge
neration of experts.  A Centre of Excellence for Energy Studies would address many of the present deficiencies in R&D in the province

Results are presented of performance tests on 7 CNG conversion kits available in Canada during late 1983 and early 1984.  These kits are representative of state-of-the-art for current commercial kits.  Three test vehicles were used, providing 4, 6 and 8 c
ylinder engines.  Performance degradation was apparent in all cases; the reasons for this are discussed and indication is given of the probable best operating strategy for new kit designs

The use of propane as a vehicle fuel has been growing rapidly in Canada. It is the first of the alternative fuels to benefit from major federal and provincial incentives, it is a safe, efficient and clean burning fuel, and in most parts of the country it
costs appreciably less than gasoline.  This report reviews key aspects of this new propane carburetion market, focussing specifically on market growth, consumer characteristics and reactions, industry activity and growth and finally propane supply and pri
cing.  These last two items were found to be the most significant factors affecting market growth.  During a period from 1982 to 1983 the number of conversion centres and fueling outlets appear to have doubled and the amount of propane sold for vehicle us
e increased by 55%

An electronic dual fuel natural gas/diesel conversion system has been developed for the Caterpillar 3406 diesel engine with the Programmable Electronic Control system.  This system is microprocessor based, and interfaces with the Caterpillar PEEC system t
o allow control of diesel injection time as well as fuel quantity.  Control of injection timing allows pilot fuel levels as low as 3% at full load, however, to ensure good transient response, minimum pilot is about 10%.  The completed system has similar p
erformance to the diesel engine, with comparable efficiency at full load.  (from author abstract

This paper describes the propulsion system of the AC Delco Systems (ACD)/Allison Transmission Division (ATD) 22 foot shuttle bus.  The series hybrid electric drive bus was a technology demonstrator vehicle using a lightweight, low-floor chassis and body.
The program was structured around three main objectives: demonstration of feasibility, performance, and durability.  A transit bus was selected to demonstrate the technology because of its contribution to air pollution, and its predictable nature of opera
tion such as duty cycle, start/stop operation, and low average speed.

A computational model has been developed to examine two-dimensional flow and heat transfer in a combustion chamber with emphasis on the interaction between the combustion space and the load.  The load is considered semi-transparent to thermal radiation.
Therefore, conduction and radiatio through the load has been considered in the model.  The heat flux incident on the load surface is caluculated from the temperature field resulting from combustion and heat transfer simulation.  Compressible flow and comb
ustion phenomena, along with radiative and convective heat transfer, are simulated in a natual gas-fired combustion chamber. The results provide the temperature distribution and heat flux along the load surface.  The study predicts the local peak heat flu
x to the load from the combustion space (author abstract 2 tabs., 5 figs., 26 refs

Some test results of CNG fueled vehicle have already been reported by gas companies, but they have say little about the qualification of CNG for automotive fuel This paper reports on the combustion characteristics of CNG and establishes its qualification
for alternative fuel and for clean fuel. CNG has many advantages when used in automotive engines. Since it comes as a gas, it has a higher octane number and allows a leaner burning than gasoline. Under designs specially created to take advantage of CNG, a
n unique engine system was achieved which would not have been realized with gasoline fuel CNG has some demerits, however, such as decrease in power, poor component durability, and short driving range by one tankful. Thus its study should be continued to e
stablish CNG as automotive fuel. (author abstract

A pilot fuel regulating system includes a pilot fuel governor for supplying varying amounts of pilot fuel to an engine.  A piston housed within an elongated bore moves longitudinally therein in response to changing engine speeds to regulate the flow of fu
el through the governor.  A minor diameter portion and chamber portion of the piston allow the passage of varying amounts of fuel through the bore.  In preferred embodiments, the minor diameter portion is elongated to define a moving reservoir within the
bore for dampening fuel pressure oscillations (Author abstract)

This test method is an accelerated test for evaluating the resistance of metals to cracking failure in aqueous environments containing hydrogen sulphide.  The object of developing this standard was to facilitate conformity in testing, so that data compile
d from a number of sources could be compared on an equal basis.  The fact that this is a severe, accelerated test can result in several undesirable side effects, i.e. hydrogen blistering, and necessitates a warning that it should not be used alone in dete
rmining criterion for an alloy for use in this type of environment

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Based on models in the literature, for the ignition of hydrocarbons and hydrogen, a mathematical model has been developed to simulate the chemical interactions of the fuels.  The model has the capability to simulate engine-like variations of temperature,
pressure, and volume in order to compute ignition delays of dual fuel engines.  For experimental validation of the model, tests have also been conducted on a special compressio ignition research engine. (From author abstract)

The author sees the future of alternate fuels as dependent on the price and availability of petroleum and petroleum products.  He discusses the world oil market, and then briefly examines alternative fuels for transportation.  Methanol from natural gas is
discussed as the probable future fuel of choice, as it is economically and environmentally most acceptable.  Advantages and disadvantages of methanol fuels are outlined.  Finally, transition from a petroleum based transportation system to that of an alte
rnative fuel is discussed in terms of economic and government mandated transitions

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The objective of the test was to assess the feasibility of propane as an automotive fuel in Manitoba, by comparing the overall performance and operating costs of a fleet operating on propane with of a control fleet operating on unleaded gasoline. The test
and control fleets each consisted of 25 vehicles taken from the existing Manitoba Telephone System fleet of service vehicles.  Each fleet was composed of a selection of a similar vehicle pairs ranging from subcompact automobiles with a mass of 1160 kg to
bulk tankers with a mass of 12700 kg. Engine displacement varied from 1.57 to 6.55 L. During the two year test period, the propane fleet travelled about 750000 km while the gasoline control fleet travelled about 1 000 000 km. The performance of gasoline
and propane was compared by using two specific types: General driveability and relative fleet fuel consumption were determined by driver surveys and gross fuel data from normal urban and rural vehicle operation. Specific fuel consumption was determined by
controlled chassis dynamometer tests on a series of selected vehicles utilizing representative driving cycles.

This paper provides an overview of on-farm demonstrations of compressed natural gas use in Saskatchewan.  The first part of the paper describes the following:  the initial project on the Fahlman farm; the expansion of the CNG demonstrations to five other
farms; and the interaction of several provincial government departments, a provincial utility, and the federal government in developing the expanded program.  The second part of the paper presents the status of the program and reviews some of the majo fin
dings to date, such as the availability of fuelling station equipment and the suitability of conversion equipment for both gasoline and diesel engines.  (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Assured availability of fuel during future crises and the increasing prices of petroleum based fuels have become major concerns of fleet operators ever since the Arab Embargo of 1978-1979.  These concerns are causing fleet operators to consider using alte
rnative fuels, the most popular being compressed natural gas.  This paper focuses on the capital, operating, and maintenance costs associated with the conversion of several different types of fleets as compared to the costs of operating the same fleets on
gasoline.  Two methods of analyzing potential savings realized by the conversion are presented for each fleet; the methods are a Simple Payback Analysis and a computerized Equipment Economic Cost Study Analysis (return on investment)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of an oxygen sensor to monitor exhaust gas composition is the only accurate method of calibrating a first generation NGV fuelling system. Current techniques for installing an oxygen sensor are unacceptable due to their cost, difficulty and reliabi
lity.  This project was used to develop a more effective method of installing the sensor and then sealing the hole upon completion of the calibration procedure.  A special tool was developed, along with new procedures and materials, to provide a simple, f
oolproof method of installation.  This method is applicable to most engines and vehicles and should make calibration using an oxygen sensor a routine procedure

This thesis describes the development of equipment used to test vehicles under varied driving conditions either on the road or a chassis dynamometer.  The principal requirement for the equipment was that it would be suited to the testing of vehicles in ac
cordance with the recently introduced Passenger Vehicle Fuel Consumption Procedure set out in the New Zealand Standard 5420:1980.  The equipment has subsequently been used to obtain fuel consumption figures over an open road and urban drive cycle for a la
rge range of vehicles.  The main interest lay in investigating the differences between road and dynamometer fuel consumption results and considerable emphasis was placed on developing procedures to reduce these differences.  Finally, it was also sought to
determine and isolate those parameters which affect the accuracy of fuel consumption results of a standard passenger vehicle to the requirements of the NZA 5420:1980.  (Author abstract)

These speech notes provide an overview of the role of Energy, Mines and Resources Canada in relation to the alternative fuels industry in Canada.  There is discussion of the ministry's role as a catalyst to provide policies that will encourage progress by
updating federal regulations, and promote the value of partnerships between government, academic institutions and industry.  Regional and sector-specific strategies are likely to be the most effective in this large country.  Reviews of the ministry's sup
port for research and development projects, and of regulatory and tax initiatives by governments are given.  The importance of cooperation between the private sector and government is emphasized.

The Moomba-to Sydney, Australian natural gas pipeline ruptured July 25, 1982 at a point 4.2 km (2.6 miles) from the plant at Moomba.  Laboratory analyses of the failed section predicted the probability of more failures due to stress-corrosion cracking (SC
C) outside the initially replaced first 10 km of line.  As a result, another 20 km of pipeline were replaced and changes made in the line's operating procedures to reduce the risk of further failures due to SCC. This first of three articles discussing the
analyses following the failure focuses on the pipeline's design and tests of steel specimens from original and replacement joints.  Various tests including a flame ionization leak-detection survey, a Pearson survey, a soil resistivity survey and an acous
tic emission test indicate that significant SCC existed in the first 10 km of pipeline and only where the coating was disbonded but not in all cases of disbonding.  No cracking occurre in locations having a high soil resistivity.  Crack measurements were
taken, tapered tensile-specimen stress-corrosion tests conducted and pressure records examined to obtain a clearer picture of conditions for crack growth.  (See als citation #1067-part 2 and #1068-conclusion

A review is made of some of the main problems associated with the use of natural gas, notably methane, in dual fuel engines of the compression ignition diesel type.  It is shown that such applications represent in principle a very attractive mode for the
utilization of the fuel for the production of power generally at relatively high efficiencies and outputs with good exhaust emissions characteristics.  Some relevant solutions to the problems outlined are then discussed.  Moreover, some further research a
nd development needed in this general area is also outlined

The objective of this study was to determine the relative roles of the intake and compression strokes in generating turbulence in the combustion chamber and to examine the effects of turbulence on combustion duration.  A Rapid Intake and Compression Machi
ne was designed and built, which can simulate the piston motion of a reciprocating internal combustion engine at 1000 rpm.  Comparative data was obtained for the turbulence intensity and combustion duration for the intake and compression stroke and for th
e compression stroke itself in a one-cylinder spark-ignited rapid intake and compression machine with a flat-disk combustion chamber, running on a methane-air mixture under defined operating conditions.  It was concluded that under the present engine cond
itions the compression stroke generates practically no turbulence, which limits the contribution of the compression stroke to the flow conditions around ignition time

There is a strong interest around the world in natural gas as an alternative fuel. This paper is concerned with the option of converting diesel engines to spark ignition operation.  Although this may appear to be an outrageous thermodynamic action, it is
preferable to using natural gas in a low compression gasoline engine conversion.  An investigation is described in which engine maps were produced for a 5.6 litre direct injection diesel engine converted to CNG.  The diesel operating characteristics have
been compared with those of the spark ignition conversion at compression ratios of 18:1 (the original diesel value), 15:1 and 13:1.  Detailed data are presented for the 15:1 compression ratio.  These test results are supplemented by results for other dies
el conversions.  The use of these engines in bus fleet operations is also discussed (author abstract 9 figs., 2 tabs., 7 refs

A single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine having a 17.1:1 compression ratio was converted to operate on hydrogen.  Hydrogen gas at 1500 psig pressure was admitted into the engine combustion chamber through a hydraulically-actuated injection valve w
hich allowed control of the injection timing and duration.  This paper briefly reviews performance characteristics, including ignition, timing, efficiency and emissions

Experiments were conducted to investigate the fundamental characteristics of combustion (blowout limits, pollutant CO emissions) for low heating value gaseous fuels.  Additionally, the conversion properties of ammonia to NOx were investigated for a simula
ted coal-derived gaseous fuel The results were: the blowout limit and carbon monoxide emission are very sensitive to the fuel compostion; staged, rich-lean combustion has the ability to decrease the yield of NOx from ammonia without producing incomplete c
ombustion if the primary excess air ratio is adjusted to a proper value (author abstract 5 refs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Ontario initiated the first major natural gas bus development and demonstration program in North America during 1988. Today, 80 compressed natural gas (CNG) powered buses are in operation in and around Toronto and over 150 additional units are on order. I
n this program considerable experience was generated on the performance, economics, reliability, safety, and exhaust emissions of state of the art CNG buses and the infrastructure. This paper provides an overview of the Ontario CNG bus development and dem
onstration program and discusses in some detail the experience gained over the last two years of the program. The primary conclusion reached to date is that natural gas provides significant environmental and economic benefits relative to diesel fuel in ty
pical transit.

This report assesses the potential durability of the L10 engine converted to operate on Natural Gas (NG). The engine conversion technology was originally developed at ORTECH International under the sponsorship of MTO, CEC and Consumers' Gas. The objective
s of such development work include diversification leading to reduced dependence on diesel fuel, and improved air quality through reduced engine emissions.The Cummins L10 engine was considered an excellent candidate for conversion to Otto cycle NG combust
ion. The original development program resulted in an engine that has the potential to match the diesel output in terms of performance, and also to meet future emissions standards. (summary)Limited availability contact Kelly Darby of Gas Technology Can

Adsorption isotherms were measured for various high-pressure gases (Ar, N2, CH4, CO, CO2, C2H6, C2H4, and N2O) using Linde 5A and 13X zeolite adsorbents.  The tests take place at 25, 50 and 75 C, 1-~180 atm for N2 and 1-~100 atm for the other gases.  A ne
w procedure has been developed for generalizing the adsorption equation by analyzing the relationship betwen the quadrupole of the adsorbate molecule and th electrostatic field in the zeolite cavity.  By using the high-pressure adsorption data obtained in
the present work and in the preceding work it is shown that this new procedure has a broader applicability than the previous method

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A number of alternative natural gas storage concepts are examined to determine if lower storage pressures can be used without decreasing on-board storage or if on-board storage can be increased without increasing pressure.  Techniques studied include:  lo
w temperature and cryogenic (LNG) storage; enhanced storage on solid and liquid adsorbents; storage enhancement using other gases; and storage of methane as a solid crystal.  With the technology presently available conventional storage techniques (CNG and
LNG) provide the best storage characteristics.  At this time only storage as a solid crystal (clathrate) appears to have a future as a storage enhancement tool

This paper compares the emissions of a bus engine before and after its conversion to dual fuel (CNG/Diesel Oil).  The measurements show that natural gas is a very interesting alternate fuel for public transportation as it reduces air pollution while not a
ltering significantly the performance of the engine.  (Author abstract)

In 1984 twenty seven Ford Ranger pickup trucks were delivered to 25 major utility and natural gas related companies in the U.S. and Canada.  The result of years of research, these vehicles represented America's first factory built vehicles which were desi
gned to be dedicated compressed natural gas powered.  This paper describes the engine modifications and their effects on performance, fuel economy and exhaust emissions.  Also included are information on problems encountered with the test vehicles, and co
st differences between the CNG and gas powered Rangers

This presentation, from the conference on Commercializing Clean Fuels for Transportation (April 12-14, 1992, Ottawa, Ontario), outlines how the Canadian General Standards Board establishes national guidelines for fuels, their impact on the industry, the p
rovinces and the environment.  The national standardization of fuels and related matters is an essential element in eliminating interprovincial barriers to trade, in harmonising provincial efforts on environmental considerations and in bringing order into
a complex situation.  (from author introduction

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The heightened interest in monitoring is being driven by operating and regulatory pressures. Monitoring has traditionally been used to keep compressor units operating efficiently and prevent expensive breakdowns . Currently, this function is being enhance
d. In some environmental non-compliance areas, "enhanced monitoring" is required to provide a continuous record of emissions from stationary pollution sources such as engine- or turbine-driven compressor units.

This Energy Update provides a summary of the findings of a research project examining the potential use of methanol as a transportation fuel in Australia.  It was determined that methanol would have to be able to replace a significant proportion of gasoli
ne and diesel currently used to be economically feasible.  Crude oil prices would have to double in rea terms while the price of natural gas feedstock remained constant for ther to be any cost savings associated with changing to methanol; and, crude oi pr
ices would have to go up further to justify the additional costs o manufacturing vehicles for methanol use. (from author abstract

In the so-called Start Project within the Program 1000 (program presented at EVS-11 with target of 1000 electric or hybrid vehicles), the first part of a new fleet of EVs are now running.  There are some essential points to be made and they are as follows
:  -  The project is led by a systems approach, including the traffic system, cars, service, energy supply and charging, people and corporations with transport needs.-  The cars in the Start Project, ten light vans,are all equipped with high perform
ance batteries, and is the largest fleet of its kind in Sweden so far.-  The EVs mainly serve commercial users and run on a leasing basis.-  The users take part in an evaluation program.-  The first charging station of its kind is introduced in the
Gteborg city centre.  The charging station is able to deliver normal, medium and fast charging.-  A service organisation is established.-  Co-operation, new relations and a development process are underway with different and important parties involve
d, such as the city, car manufacturers, energy companies, car users and national authorities.The new phase 1994/95 will include more EVs, mainly passenger cars.  The user perspective and infrastructure related topics remain very important.  The projec
t will be an important part of a new national four year demonstration program for EVs and hybrid vehicles.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The operating range with respect to power output and speed of the electrical machine in a hybrid car can be very large.  It is mostly used under part load condition.  A substantial degradation of the efficiency in the electrical machine will take place if
a normal constant flux control scheme is used.  In the literature various solutions to optimise the operational behaviour have been given, based on a given supply system (constant voltage as source to an idealized inverter).  The paper discusses the appl
ication of these control schemes in the hybrid scheme in details, resulting in the conclusion that not all of them can fulfil the requirements if the influence of the inverter and the battery on the overall efficiency of the drive system is considered.  A
suitable control sheme for battery based drive systems with induction motors will be presented and discussed in details, supported by calculations and measurements.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The combustion noise generated by DI diesel engines can be clearly reduced during both steady-state and transient operation in applying a pilot injection.  After optimization, a slight increase in fuel consumption is found in the upper load range.  The pi
lot injection also tends to reduce the NOx emissions.  An increase in black smoke emissions is considered to be the main drawback with pilot injection.  High speed Schlieren photographs of injection and combustion phenomena within a pressurized chamber sh
ow that the higher black smoke emissions may be due to the combustion of the main injection quantitiy that occurs in a mixture which is insufficiently prepared and with nearly no delay due to the pilot injection.  On the basis of these findings, it is con
cluded that a high degree of atomization and rapid vaporization of the main injection quantity must be accomplished To better achieve these goals, a separate injection nozzle for the pilot quantity is preferred to an injection system with a single injecti
on nozzle, providing both the pilot and the main quantity.  Therefore, separate pilot injector can be developed which can provide a constant pilot quantity and controlled pilot injection time over the entire engine map (author abstract 12 refs

The process of filling vehicle cylinders with natural gas has been analyzed, and factors such as cylinder temperature, ambient temperature, cylinder specifications, starting pressure, and temperature rise during filling have been evaluated. The temperatur
e change of the gas during filling has been modelled theoretically, and some experimental tests have been carried out to verify the validity of the model. These results have been used to develop a draft test procedure for electronic natural gas dispensers
, to ensure that the dispensers compensate properly for temperature and will operate over the required range of ambient conditions. The draft test procedure will serve as a guide for the design of a testing standard for electronic natural gas dispensers.

Conventional four-stroke diesel conversion kits cannot be used successfully on two-stroke engines because of excessive gas blow by and low efficiency.  DSMA Acton Ltd. have developed a conversion system for two-stroke engines which they feel will solve th
ese basic problems.  This paper reviews briefly a two phase program carried out by DSMA for Energy, Mines and Resources Canada and the Toronto Transit Authority.  Tests of the system demonstrate the technical feasibility of DSMA's conceptual design howeve
r they recommend a laboratory and field test program be conducted to provide further information

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Fuel cells with solid polymer electrolytes using hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants were developed in the beginning of the sixties for use in the American Gemini space project. Organic ion exchange membranes as solid electrolytes and separators were fir
st described for use in fuel cells by Grubb. Starting in the mid eighties interest has been growing in development of the solid polyelectrolyte fuel cell, due to the growing awareness of energy and enviromental problems. The solid polyelectrolyte fuel cel
l has many specific advantages in comparison with other fuel cell types, low operating temperature, high energy efficiency with respect to volume and mass, stationary electrolyte and hence no corrosive liquids, self starting at ambient temperature, and re
versible systems (fuel cell and electrolysis). Efficiency achieved in single cells is 2 W cm-2, (50 cm2, 80*C, H2 and O2 344 kPa each), At a current density of 0.5 A cm-2 cells were operated over more than 2000 hrs. Cells with active areas of more than 10
00 cm2 and 10 kW have been constructed. (author)

A presentation was made showing results of a study comparing natural gas pilot ignition to standard diesel.  This paper gives an overview of and data from the presentation.  The problem addressed is that typically 25% of natural gas is lost in the scaveng
ing process of dual fuel natural gas two-stroke engines.  The proposed solution is through the timed injection of natural gas in the second half of the scavenging process, ideally no natural gas will be lost to the exhaust

Single cylinder and multicylinder direct injection engines from the same engine family were used to evalute the performance of stabilized diesel fuels containing methanol, ethanol, water, and chemical stabilizer.  Engine speed and load conditions were sel
ected to provide sufficient smoke and particulate emissions for accurate measurement.  All fuels were operated at equal energy input rates for the engine being tested The stabilized fuels containing alcohols had relatively minor effects on the HC, CO, and
NOx emissions and engine brake efficiency for either the single or multicylinder engine.  The water microemulsion fuel demonstrated a tendancy for increased HC and CO emissions, and minor changes in the NOx and brake efficiency for both engines.  Both en
gines demonstrated reduced smoke and particulate emissions for the stabilized alcohol and water microemulsion fuels.  These reductions ranged from only a few percent to over 50% and were accompanied by significant increases in the Soluble Organic Fraction
of the particulate

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A method of reducing the oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust gas emissions of an internal combustion engine is described.  Using natural gas as a fuel and operating with an equivalence ratio from about 1.25 to about 1.35 measurements are made on a standard
7-mode driving cycle.  The equivalence ratio of 1.25 corresponds to the greatest amounts of nitrogen permissable as measured in parts per million.  The ratio of 1.35 corresponds to the value where unacceptable power loss would result if exceeded.  A gas-a
ir mixer is employed that has a modified metering pin in order to operate with natural gas inlet pressures between -0.5 inches to +0.5 inches of H2O and within the specified range of equivalence ratios.  A modulator is used to obtain a fuel-rich condition
at full throttle to increase power

The objective of the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell - Core Research Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory is to conduct the basic and applied research necessary to bring PEM fuel cell technology to the performance and cost levels require
d for widespread use in transportation.  The program has focused until recently on H2/air and reformate/air fuel cells.  The specific goals have been to reduce the intrinsic costs, to increase the power density, to optimize the system for operation on ref
ormed organic fuels and air, and to achieve stable, efficient long-term operation.  A central direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), demonstrating performances which bring this technology closer to a competitive edge vs. the methanol reformer + reformate/air f
uel cell system.

This paper describes the successful operation of a research single cylinder direct injection dual fuel engine on excessively rich mixtures of methane and oxygen enriched air.  This is done with the view that the partial oxidation of methane would produce
significant concentrations of hydrogen in the exhaust gas while producing simultaneously mechanical power.  Various features of engine performance and exhaust hydrogen production under such unconventional operation are presented and discussed. (author abs

The use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a high octane gasoline component has significantly increased during the last decade.  The reasons for this increase are MTBE's high octane quality, relatively low vapour pressure and compatibility with gaso
line hydrocarbons.  Recent developments suggest that MTBE and other ethers may help control some of the environmental problems associated with gasoline volatility and aromatics content MTBE-gasoline blends when compared to gasoline generally reduce the ca
rbon monoxide emissions and increase the aldehyde from automobile exhausts.  The extent of CO reductions depends on the fuel metering system and though higher when compared to those from gasoline, are significantly reduced by three-way catalytic converter
s which are now fitted on all post 1987 model automobiles in Canada (from executive summary

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

From 1991 up to 1993, a field trial with 20 Volkswagen type Golf II hybrid (parallel) vehicles was conducted in the town of Zurich and its surroundings.  The internal combustion engine was of the diesel type with swirl chamber, turbocharged and further eq
uipped with an oxidizing catalyst.  The results are predominantly positive.  Emissions and fuel consumption were roughly halved using the FTP 75-, the European ECE-R15- and a city-cycle defined for the town of Zurich.  Emissions results, therfore, are wel
l below the limits in Switzerland (corresponding to USA 87).  Electricity consumption ranged from 9 up to 19 kWh/100 km - measured at the electricity outlet (socket).  The electric part of the drive train was jointly developed between Volkswagen AG and Bo
sch BmbH, and functioned amazingly well.  The drivers with very different backgounds could quite easily adjust to the somewhat different operating conditions.  One of the emerging trouble spots were the batteries.  The relatively heavy vehicle (empty mass
between 1200 and 1280 kg) should have a minimum electric power of some 10kW instead of the presen 7 kW.  With 10 kW the Swiss regulations regarding electric power relative to vehicle weight would be fulfilled.  If one wants to drive with locally zero emi
ssions the present hybrid concept is a very valid candidate for consideration; weighing the pros and contras, it is the preferred version to the purely electric vehicle.  If one does not have a severe local air quality problem, the overall (considering to
tal emissions and primary energyconsumption ) best solution quite likely is the one with IC-engine in a light and safe vehicle meeting the ULEV-standards.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Methanol-fueled SI engines have proven to be difficult to start at ambient temperatures below approximately 10 degrees C.  The use of dimethyl ether (DME) is proposed to improve the cold starting performance of methanol-fueled SI engines. Tests to evaluat
e this idea were carried out with a modified single-cylinder CFR research engine having a compression ratio of 12:1.  The engine was fueled with combinations of gaseous dimethyl ether and liquid methanol having DME mass fractions of 30%, 40%, 60% and 70%.
For comparison, tests were also carried out with 100% methanol and with winter grade premium unleaded gasoline.  Overall stoichiometric mixtures were used in all tests.  (Author abstract)

This report examines the economics of converting mainline railways from diesel fuel to natural gas.  To provide a focus for the economic analysis, CP Rail operations between Calgary and Sparwood and the West Coast were examined.  An analysis was conducted
to determine the sensitivity of the economics to changes in all variables.  However, the variables with the greatest influence on the economics are diesel fuel and the natural gas prices and the locomotive power losses incurred with the conversion to gas
. To assess the impact of simultaneous variation in key parameters and to provide an assessment of the degree of risk associated with conversion to natural gas, a scenario analysis was undertaken.  (Author Abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Although natural gas appears to be a politically promising energy alternative for the Nordic countries, it is felt that it is important that all aspects of fuel application in motor vehicles be understood.  The objective of this study was to investigate w
hether or not using natural gas driven buses would 'significantly' reduce exhaust emissions from bus traffic.  The demonstration projects suggested include comparing the environmental effects of natural gas/biogas drive relative to currently applied and p
roven technology.  A number of technologies are examined and potential for future developments discussed.  This report presents a prestudy and outline of a program for implementing a demonstration project on bus conversion in Sweden

A Burnett type of apparatus for the study of the volumetric behavior of gases at low temperatures and high pressures was constructed.  The apparatus was used to study the volumetric behavior of methane and four mixtures of hydrogen and methane from +50 de
grees to -200 degrees F. and pressures as high as 7,000 lb./sq.in.  The experimental data were used to obtain the second virial coefficients for pure methane and for the mixtures.  The results of approximately 600 experimental points were used to obtain a
table of compressibility factors for methane and the mixtures at even increments of pressure and temperature

The objective of the investigation is to provide a risk assessment analysis of a newly commercial natural gas appliance designed to compress natural gas at residential distribution system pressures (2900-3000 psi pressures), which is delivered to the stor
age cylinders in compressed natural gas vehicles (NGV's). The report provides (i) background information on the use of natural gas as a motor vehicle fuel and the experience from previous reports on NGV safety investigations. (ii) An assessment of the saf
ety of the VRA/NGV system, and a comparison of the risks to the user using the appliance relative to other risks taken by society. (iii) An appendix section which provides two risk assessment reports for the VRA undertaken independently for this investiga
tion by a group in the Netherlands (the TNO Institute of Environmental and Energy Technology), and in the U.S./Canada (Primatech Inc.). Available: Price $50, contact Kelly Darby of Gas Technology CanadaTel.(416) 449 0040 Fax (416) 449 4999

Manufacturers of motor vehicles and engines may face substantial compliance challenges because of existing or proposed environmental regulations.  Among the challenges due to existing regulations is the need for improved control of evaporative emissions f
rom gasoline vehicles and emissions of particulate matter from heavy-duty diesel trucks.  Potential future challenges could arise from the need to control refueling emissions  and from more stringent emission standards for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitro
gen.  Virtually all of these regulations require technological changes to vehicles and engines, assuming that gasoline and diesel fuel remain as the operating fuels.  However, recent speculation has centered on the possibility of meeting some or all of th
ese regulatory challenges with alternative fuels such as natural gas or methanol.  This study addresses that possibility by examining current and potential standards, characterizing vehicles that use alternative fuels, and assessing, via an informal canva
ss of manufacturers, the likelihood of meeting the regulations with both conventional and alternative fuels A selective literature review compares emissions, energy use, and costs associated with both types of fuels.  Finally, a plausible scenario of intr
oducing methanol-fueled autos and light trucks by the early 1990's is defined as the basis for examining changes in emission levels nationally.  While the overall reduction, from all transportation sources, of reactive hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen
due to these vehicles is less than 1% by 1997, the potential remains for greater levels of reduction within urbanized areas, especially if tax-based incentives and other measures are used to encourage the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels (auth

As part of its Alternative Fuels Assessment, the U.S. Department of Energy is studying the use of compressed natural gas (CNG), methanol, and other derivatives of natural gas as alternative transportation fuels.  One part of this study is determining the
cost and most likely sources of new, uncommitted natural gas supply.  The largest sources of natural gas are outside the United States.  Remaining reserves of natural gas in the US, excluding about 25 trillion cubic feet (tcf) on the North slope of Alask
a, are about 166 tcf (Oil and Gas Journal Worldwide Report 1990), which represents approximately 4% of the world's proved reserves.  A section of the report gives a country-by-country description of reserves and cost, followed by a brief discussion of the
gas reserves in Angola, Bolivia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Tunisia

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Due to differences in combustion speeds between CNG and petrol the idle speed of a bi-fuel CNG/petrol engine can change significantly when switching between the two fuels.  This can cause driveability, stalling and run-on problems.  A technique has been d
eveloped which reduces the speed change to acceptable levels.  Five vehicles have been tested and idle speed differences of more than 400 rev/min. were reduced to less than 80 rev/min. CNG consumption rates were reduced and vehicle driveability was improv
ed.  The technique could be applied to a large proportion of the New Zealand CNG fleet at relatively little cost to the consumer. (Author Abstract)

This paper summarizes the results of a number of Canadian research studies into the effects of distillate fuels on performance, combustion, and durability for diesel engines.  This research focused on relating the effects of reducing fuel ignition quality
(cetane number) on engine performance.  The studies involved engine test programs where a number of experimental fuels were blended to represent the future Canadian fuel scenario.  The experimental fuels contained varying percentages of tar sands derived
components, light cycle oils, components derived from conventional sources, and in some cases residual fuels.  (From author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Industrialized agriculture is highly dependent on liquid fuels. Many farmers have been concerned at the cost and availability of conventional fuels to power their tractors, other vehicles and field machinery.  This paper attempts to discuss the limitation
s to the supply and utilisation of gaseous fuels by the rural sectors. Compression ignition engine conversions must be both technically and economically viable for farmers to utilise cng or lpg fuels which is unlikely to be the case in the short term.  An
infrastructure to deliver these fuels to the farms must also be developed.  Small scale production of lng currently being demonstrated in the UK is discussed but the costs appear prohibitive.  Producing their own energy supply has been the objective of m
any farmers.  Matching the supply of gas with the variable on-farm demand is difficult.  Production costs are high and reduced tractor power and range between refills are major deterrents to a general acceptance by the farming industry of this technology.
In New Zealand, the use of inedible animal fat processed into liquid esters using methanol produced from natural gas is showing real promise when blended with diesel.  Having reached the demonstration stage of the programme it currently appears to be th
e most feasible method of utilising natural gas as a substitute for conventional fuels on the farm.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The design considerations and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of high efficiency, low emissions, hydrogen-fueled engine for use as the prime mover of a series hybrid automobile is described. The series hybrid automobile uses the engine to gene
rate electrical energy via a lightweight generator, the electrical energy is stored in a power peaking device (like a flywheel or ultracapacitor) and used as required to meet the tractive drive requirements (plus accessory loads) through an electrical mot
or. The engine/generator is stopped whenever the energy storage device is fully charged. Engine power output required was determined with a vehicle simulation code to be 15 to 20 kW steady state with peak output of 40 to 50 kW for hill climb. Combustion c
hamber and engine geometry were determined from a critical review of the hydrogen engine experiments in the literature combined with a simplified global engine model. Hydrogen's high effective octane number and high flame speed permits high compression ra
tio and very lean operation to simultaneously achieve high efficiency and low NOx emissions. The baseline design has dual-ignition, 15:1 compression ratio and operates in the 0.4 to 0.5 equivalent ratio range using homogeneous charge. The engine is curren
tly envisioned as naturally aspirated with tuned intake and exhaust at the 15 to 20 kW level and supercharged to achieve the 40 to 45 kW power level. The engine is projected to operate in the 1800 to 3600 RPM range to minimize friction losses. Two differe
nt engine models are employed to guide engine design. The models are simplified global engine performance model that relies strongly on correlations with literature data for heat transfer and friction losses, and state-of-the-art CFD combustion model, KIV
A-3, to elucidate fluid mechanics and combustion details through full three-dimensional modeling. Both intake and exhaust processes as well as hydrogen combustion chemistry and thermal NOx production are simulated. Ultimately, a comparison between the sim
ulation and experimental results will lead to improved modeling and will give guidance to changes required in the next generation engine to achieve our goal of 45 % brake thermal efficiency.

The report summarizes the results of the second year of a three year research program aimed at fundamental investigations of catalytic methane activation.  The catalyst included supported and unsupported molybdenum and tungsten oxides.  The blank activity
of various oxide supports has been studied.  Also, the effect of traces of ethane in the feedstream and of passivating the supports or reactor walls with boric acid has been investigated.  Modification of catalytically active oxides by adding a second co
mponent allowed adjustment of the oxygen transfer capability of th surfaces and thus influenced the selectivity towards partial oxidation products, such as formaldehyde (author abstract 2 tabs., 2 figs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This study was undertaken to determine how the composition of natural gas varies.  Factors which determine the quality of gas supplied to customers are examined and measures of the gas quality at important points in the system are then analyzed to show th
e nature and extent of the variations in practice.  Designers of NGV engines need to know how variable a fuel it is and how its methane level and energy content may vary.  This analysis suggests the NGV industry has a choice:  design systems to handle the
extremes of gas quality occuring in the system; or, restrict the location of refuelling stations to locations served by flows sufficiently commingled that less onerous standards can be supplied

This report describes the results of dual fuel tests performed on a Nissan PD6T 265 hp six cylinder turbocharged direct injection diesel engine.  To date only small or medium size higher speed engines (6.3 litre or less) have been characterized in this co
untry.  This engine comes into the category of medium speed large engines of the type found in "line haul" type trucks.  The report covers the effect of changes in CNG substitution on thermal efficiency, emissions and exhaust temperature for a range of sp
eeds and loads.  The trends in the results recorded here are very similar to those recorded on the smaller high speed engines (from author introduction 18 figs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

There are many ways of using methanol to reduce the current dependence on petrol and diesel fuels; directly by blending with, or substituting for, conventional fuels and adapting the engines accordingly, or by using the methanol as a chemical intermediate
for the production of a fuel more suited to standard engines.  In this paper the former case is considered, i.e. the direct use of methanol as a fuel.  This represents the longer term goal, with the evolution of new engines specifically designed to take
advantage of the fuel properties of methanol. (From author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The recovery of hydrogen from such metal hydrides as LiH, MgH2, TiH2, CaH2 and FeTiH compounds is studied, with the aim of evaluating the viability of the technique for the storage of hydrogen fuel. The pressure temperature dependence of the reactions, en
thalpies of formation, the kinetics of the hydrogen absorption and description, and the mechanical and chemical stability of the metal hydrides are taken into account in the evaluation. Economic aspects are considered and the development of portable metal
hydride hydrogen storage reservoirs is also mentioned.

This report describes how those characteristics of the electric vehicles differ from those of gasoline powered vehicles.  Recently, Nissan has developed and began marketing two electric vehicles; a 4-passenger sedan, the CEDRIC EV, which is suited for bot
h general and commercial use, and a 2-passenger commerical car, the AVENIR EV.  Accelerations, noise, driving range, power control, and braking are some of the factors that were tested at various conditions and compared to give the performance difference
between the electric vehicle and the gasoline powered vehicle.  Although the driving range of an EV is sensitive to external air temperature, air conditioner, and battery operating conditions,  most other aspects of the EVs were comparable to the gasoline
powered vehicle, if not better.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

During this project, Sierra Research, Inc. and Charles River Associates have analyzed a wide range of mobile source emissions control measures required by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations.  Sierra and
CRA have been involved in the followings during the course of this project:+ developed a cost estimation methodology for wide variety of control measures;+ developed an effectiveness estimation methodology that ignores emission reductions occurring
at times and locations where violations of air quality standards do not occur;+ developed a cost effectiveness methodology that reasonably accounts for the time value of money and the greater benefits associated with near-term emission reductions and t
hat consistently and reasonably allocates costs across simultaneous reductions in more than one pollutant.The above methodologies were used to a broad range of control measures including second generation on-board diagnostic system requirements (OBD I
I), refueling emissions control (on-board and Stage II), enhanced evaporative emissions controls, California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) standards, etc. This report discusses the net effects of the emission control on the electric and conventional vehi
cle marketplace.  Various methods of reducing the emissions and its respective cost-effectiveness ($/tons) are outlined in this report.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Information is presented, largely in table and graph form, on supply and demand aspects of propane in the U.S., particularly as relates to its use as a transportation fuel.  Economic factors which influence both supply and demand are discussed.  It is fel
t that in the U.S. it is refinery economics which will set the price of propane in the future.  Though the market price for propane has traditionally been set by natural gas processing costs, causing refinery propane to be sold below cost, it has been pre
dicted that by 1990 the production cost of refinery propane will rise from 58 cents/gallon in 1980 to $1.33/gallon

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Moomba-to-Sydney, Australian natural gas pipeline ruptured July 25, 1982 at a point 4.2 km (2.6 miles) from the plant at Moomba.  Laboratory analyses of the failed section predicted the probability of more failures due to stress-corrosion cracking (SC
C) outside the initially replaced first 10 km of line.  As a result, another 20 km of pipeline were replaced and changes made in the line's operating procedure to reduce the risk of further failures due to SCC.  This second of three articles concentrates
on evaluating the integrity of the remaining parts of the line during its continued operation.  Laboratory tests were undertaken involving temperatures and stressing the conditions similar to existing conditions on the line to ascertain the extent to whic
h existing cracks could propagate and new cracks initiate.  From the tests conducted, it appeared unlikely that new stress-corrosion cracks were likely to initiate and propagate to a size that would result in a service failure.  Although laboratory tests
were not comprehensive, available data also point to the deleterious effects of large pressure excursions.  (See also citation #1066-part 1 and #1068-conclusion

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The operation of an Isuzu 6 cylinder diesel engine with partial CNG substitution using the dieselgas bypass system for reducing diesel delivery to the engine has been investigated.  Engine dynamometer test work established that engine performance using th
e dieselgas system in manual operation closely resembles that obtained and recorded in Auckland University Report ARO/1796.  It is shown that when in automatic operation the system is able to provide control of the level of CNG substitution across the loa
d range at 2000 rpm

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report documents a workshop held by the Gas Research Institute (GRI) ro identify the potential basic research opportunities in methane activation chemistry. Researchers in key disciplines described the state-of-art of methane chemistry and suggested
directions for future investigations. Conclusions from the workshop were used by GRI to develop its priorities for basic research in methane activation chemistry. As a result of these efforts, GRI will concentrate on these areas: organometallic chemistry,
heterogeneous catalysis/ surface science, and theoretical calculations. Methane chemistry is a fertile area, with significant potential for the discovery of novel reaction pathways. Appropriate research could lead to a plethora of possible new uses for m
ethane within the next five to ten years.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report presents final results of a project which evaluated small reciprocating natural gas-fueled engines for potential use in cogeneration applications which require 20,000-hour engine life, 4,000-hour service intervals, and high thermal efficiency.
Six small engines, ranging in size from 6 to 35 kW electrical output and modified for operation on natural gas fuel were evaluated for performance, durability, reliability, and serviceability through extensive engine testing.  Results indicate small gas
-fueled engines can achieve the life and service initial goals.  Engine life and reliability are largely dependent on engine design.  (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The bus authority of Ankara Municipality has converted 60 of its old M.A.N. busses to natural gas. In this study the performance and exhaust emissions of the new patented dual fuel system used in this conversion project has been evaluated. The results sho
w that the overall performance of the diesel engines increased with dual fuel operation. The brake specific fuel consumption decreased by approximately 10 percent for the 13 Mode test with respect to diesel fuel operation. The carbon monoxide and nitric o
xide emissions were higher than diesel fuel operation. However, they were below the ECE 1990 limit. The only drawback was the increase in unburnt total hydrocarbons.

The result of the relatively little attention given to propane as an alternative fuel in the past decade has produced limited developmental work on the conversion equipment.  This contrasts the advancements that have occurred in automotive engine control
technology Discussion will focus on the impact of installing dated propane carburetion on state-of-the-art gasoline technology vehicles by investigating 1.  a "paper" survey of propane carburetion equipment 2.  three programs testing propane vehicles for:
emissions, fue     consumption and performance; and 3.  cost analysis of the two fuel To improve vehicle operating efficiency, it was found that better matching of the carburetion to the air-flow requirements of the engine was required

This study has demonstrated that ultra low emissions can be attained with a Stirling-engine-driven electric generator configured to burn natural gas. Combustion parameters were optimized to produce the lowest possible exhaust emissions for a flame-type co
mbustor without compromising overall engine thermal efficiency.  A market application survey and manufacturing cost analysis indicate that a market opportunity potentially exists in the volumes needed to economically manufacture a newly designed Stirling
engine (Mod III) for stationary applications and hybrid vehicles.  (from author abstract

The intent of this communication is to make know the results of a semiotic analysis of communication concerning electric vehicle.  The messages emanating from the principal source have been studied in order to highlight the arguments developed to promote
or discredit the electric vehicle and to identify the sources's position.  The result of the analysis reveals that ,in France ,the argument centres around four common axes (environment, performance, economy and behaviour).  The positions of the various so
urces are very close to one another ,but there are some differences.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The combustion noise generated by DI diesel engines can be clearly reduced during both steady-state and transient operation through the application of pilot injection.  After optimization, a slight increase in fuel consumption is found in the upper load r
ange.  The pilot injection also tends to reduce the NOx emissions.  An increase in black smoke emissions is considered to be the main drawback with pilot injection.  High speed Schlieren photographs of injection and combustion phenomena within a pressuriz
ed chamber show that the higher black smoke emissions may be due to the combustion of the main injection quantity which occurs in a mixture which is insufficiently prepared and with nearly no delay due to the pilot injection.  On the basis of these findin
gs, it is concluded that a high degree of atomization and rapid vaporization of the main injection quantity must be accomplished To better achieve these goals, a separate injection nozzle for the pilot quantity is preferred over an injection system with a
single injection nozzle, providing both the pilot and main injection.  The quality of the pilot mixture formation is less important than that of the main quantity.  Therefore, rather simple injection systems with a separate pilot injection time over the
entire engine map (Author abstract

Methods are proposed for calculating rates of heat release from experimentally obtained engine pressure diagrams.  The equations for equilibrium thermodynamic properties, as calculated by Newhall and Starkman, are combined with thermodynamic analysis.  Th
e models and computer methods used for these computations for both compression and SI engines and some results obtained are discussed.  The various assumptions incorporated in the models are discussed in relation to the actual physical processes and to th
e use of the calculations in cycle simulation programs

A distribution system for the sale of compressed natural gas as a vehicular fuel has operated in Italy for forty years, and now more than 250,000 two fuel cars (CNG/gasoline) are served by 220 CNG refueling stations scattered in the north and the centre o
f the country.  This report describes the CNG distribution network and analyzes the problems connected with station design, operation, safety, metering and billing.  The economics of station operators, of the car owners, and the pros and cons of car conve
rsion to CNG are also discussed.  (Author abstract)

This paper, presented at the conference on Commercializing Clean Fuels for Transportation (April 12-14, 1992, Ottawa, Ontario), describes a demonstration project in Hamilton, Ontario.  Twenty-five transit buses of the Hamilton Street Railway Company are p
owered by natural gas as a dedicated fuel.  Ten of the natural gas buses were conversions of existing diesel buses and the remaining fifteen were purchased new in 1991 as natural gas buses.  All twenty-five use a spark-ignited engine dedicated to natural
gas fuel which is stored on-board in the compressed state.  Results and statistics of this successful demonstration program are cited.  (from author abstract

The intent of this report is to review the key aspects of the natural gas carburetion market, focussing specifically on market growth, consumer characteristics, industry activity, consumer reaction to natural gas, an factors affecting natural gas pricing
and supply.  Information for this report came from Natural Gas Vehicle Program data, telephone interviews with about 60 natural gas conversion companies and information provided by the Oil Pricing and Marketing Division of Energy, Mines and Resources Cana
da.  By the end of January 1987, the Natural Gas Vehicle Program and the CNG Demonstration Program figures indicated a total of 11,404 converted vehicles as compared to 3,309 vehicles by May 1985 with private use vehicles making up a substantial portion o
f those converted vehicles.  Current and future factors affecting natural gas prices in Canada include export prices and U.S. prices

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A microwave heating system is being developed from a ceramic fibre based particulate trap.  Direct microwave coupling to a silicon carbide coating has been shown to heat the carbon particulate to the temperatures required to burn the collected carbon.  Mi
crowave regeneration is expected to result in more uniform carbon combustion compared to burner system or electrical resistance heating.  Regeneration controls are expected to be simplified, power consumption may be lower, and the thermal stresses may be
reduced.

The objective of this research was to develop criteria for the combustion of methane.  Catalytic combustion is an attractive technology for utilizing the energy content of natural gas however, there are no active catalysts which can sustain operation in a
combustion chamber for acceptable periods of time.  New support materials are needed which can maintain these metals in an active state during combustor operation.  This research investigates methods of stabilizing supported metal catalysts at temperatur
es up to 1000 degrees C. (from author summary

A study of 32 cities around the world ranks Australian cities among the heaviest transport energy consumers.   Patterns of gasoline use per capita were found to be closely related to land-use intensity and to the relative provision made in cities for cars
or for alternative forms of transport.  The findings indicate that greater efficency in transport energy use could be achieved through improvements in both transport and physical planning of cities (author introduction

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Hydrogen is excellent for use as a cold starting aid for methanol vehicles at low ambient temperatures. Hydrogen can be produced by partial decomposition of methanol at the moment of start. This enables the spark ignition engine to utilize only one fuel a
nd there is no need for fuel additives or a separate starting fuel. An experimental investigation indicates that it is possible to start a neat methanol engine down to at least -30 degrees Celsius using the product gas from the cold start reactor describe
d in this paper. The engine ignited on the mixture, but additional methanol was needed to establish proper idling. The drivability was good directly after cold start by the addition of the hydrogen rich gas. At room temperature it was possible to both sta
rt the engine and reach an acceptable engine speed at idling with the use of only the gas from the cold start reactor.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Tests have been completed on an electrically powered city bus driven by a three phase AC motor. The possibility of extending the range of the bus and life of the batteries by use of an on board engine driven generator was examined. Compressed natural gas
was chosen as the fuel. A 30 kW three phase alternator driven by a 3.4 litre Toyota V-8 engine was selected and converted to natural gas fuelling. The results show that the modified bus had a shorter operating range and lower performance than the original
bus both in battery and hybrid modes.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The first experience and research work in the area of utilization of compressed natural gas in the transportation sector in Iran goes back to mid-1974 when the author converted a van in Tehran University Automechanics Laboratory.  Tests were carried out o
n this dual fuel (CNG or gasoline) car and results obtained from the same engine were compared.  The results of this work indicated a drastic reduction of exhaust emission in NGV.  Iran's first low pollution vehicle attracted the views of authorities and
NIGC opened an international tender to convert 1000 taxis to dual fuel.  This project was commissioned 1976 in the city of Shiraz and was subsequently terminated a year lated due to certain technical problems In 1984 this project was reconstructed, and pr
esently 1200 NGVs exist in Shiraz.  The successful reconstruction of NGV and its driverability and acceptability in Shiraz, caused the NIGC to develop further NGV plans particularly in the North-eastern part of the country.  Presently NIGC is engaged in t
he construction of four large compressed natural gas refueling stations in Mashhad.  The capacity of first stage of this project is 2000 NGVs.  The ultimate regional marketing capacity calls for 100,000 NGVs.  NGV marketing in Iran is not limited to the a
bove mentioned regions; this important project will develop in all urban areas adjacent to the natural gas trunkline (From author abstract Includes brief author biography

Composite Reinforced Aluminum CNG vehicle fuel cylinders, fabricated from precision extruded aluminum tube, with hemispherical heads formed on each end and the sidewall reinforced with high-strength composite, offers a weight reduction of up to 50% in con
tainment vessels for storage of CNG as a vehicle fuel.  In addition to weight reduction, the basic nature of the aluminum alloy used in CNG cylinders offers a container with high resistance to external corrosion and internal corrosion caused by contaminan
ts in natural gas.  The cylinders are manufactured in 10" and 13" diameters and up to lengths of 72", allowing the efficient conversion of small, medium and heavy duty vehicles to CNG

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Methane and oxygen-enriched air, are supplied to a standard single-cylinder high-speed engine of the open combustion chamber type, with considerable excess of fuel so that the incomplete combustion of methane will result in its conversion mainly to synthe
sis gas, namely CO and H2, with the simultaneous production of power.  Ignition of the gaseous mixture is provided by the ignition of a small quantity of diesel fuel towards the end of the compression stroke.  The reported work describes the apparatus and
working technique adopted for this investigation and discusses the combustion processes involved together with the mechanism of synthesis gas production.  Power outputs observed were at levels higher than those obtained conventionally yet the effective t
hermal efficiency over the whole operating range was at a level comparable with that obtained in the diesel engine.  Synthesis gas was produced at rates that appear promising for the range considered.  However, the dependence of the temperature at the end
of compression on the partial pressure of methane imposes a limitation on satisfactory operation when unmodified engines are used.  Carbon, acetylene or any other higher hydrocarbons were absent from the exhaust for the range of conditions investigated

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Polymer electrolyte fuel cell systems for propulsion applications were analyzed for hydrogen, methanol, and natural gas fuels.  Several options were considered for on-board hydrogen storage, including compressed gas, hydrides, glass microspheres, and spon
ge iron.  Both steam-reformed and partial-oxidation-reformed systems were analyzed for methanol and natural gas.  Two atmospheric pressure systems were also analyzed, one with compressed hydrogen and the other with partial oxidation reformed methanol.  Th
e calculated system efficiencies were 32 to 53% for hydrogen, 40 to 45% for methanol, and 41% for natural gas fuels.  The atmospheric pressure systems had efficiencies of 47% for hydrogen and 38% for methanol.

This report summarizes the interim results from the second phase of the methanol fleet test, covering the period August 1984 to January 1985.  The objective of the project was to test and demonstrate the use of methanol as a vehicle fuel by comparing the
overall performance of a fleet operating on regular unleaded gasoline with that of a fleet operating on a low methanol (test) blend The test blend consisted of 4.75% methanol, 4.75% isobutanol and 90.5% regular unleaded gasoline.  The fuel was bulk blende
d and conformed to the Canadian General Standards Board draft specifications for "unleaded oxygenated automotive gasoline".  Experience to date shows that the CGSB fuel can be formulated to give similar driveability to seasonally adjusted gasoline.  As on
ly one winter of operation has been completed, further testing is required. (from executive summary

This document presents the more important physical and chemical characteristics of compressed natural gas vehicle fuel and describes pertinent test methods for defining or evaluating these properties. The provisions contained in this SAE Recommended Pract
ice are intended to protect the interior surfaces of the fuel container and other vehicle fuel system components such as fuel injector and exhaust catalyst elements from the onset of corrosion, poisoning, the decomposition of liquids or large dust particl
es, or the formation of water, ice particles, frost or hydrates. The provisions in this document are not intended to address the composition of natural gas as delivered to a fuelling station, but rather at the outlet of the fuelling station as delivered t
o the containers on the vehicle. The two primary areas discussed relate to (1) compressed storage of natural gas and (2) vehicle fuel system and engine performance issues.

The increasing energy effectivity of hybrid drives is the most important problem of development of these types of EV propulsions.  Electrochemical battery is critical part of EV drives.  Decreasing battery current during acceleration and recover braking o
f EV has notable influence on energetic optimization of drive.  The proper cooperation of battery and flywheel results in a possibility of battery current limitation and minimization, thus saving primary energy.  Minimization of electrical and mechanical
losses in a properly adjusted drive structures should be the result of optimization process.  The purpose of this paper is just to present most important criteria in drive adjustment, illustrated by some simulation study examples.  These problems are stil
l considered in common with CRF-FIAT Research Center.

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has completed over one full year of operation of ten vehicles for the Federal Methanol Fleet Project.  Five of the vehicles are fueled with methanol.   Nearly 100,000 miles were accumulated on the vehicles in a nearly tro
uble-free operation during the first year.  Energy consumption for the methanol cars was slightly higher than for the gasoline cars, most likely as a result of shorter average trip lengths for the methanol cars.  Iron and lead have accumulated at a greate
r rate in the lubricating oil of the methanol cars.  Drivers ratings of vehicles reflect some dissatisfaction with the cold-weather performance of the methanol cars, but the cars have no special provisions for cold weather.  Otherwise, drivers' ratings ha
ve been very similar between methanol and gasoline cars (author abstract 4 figs., 5 tabs., 2 appends., 10 refs Results from the Second Year of Operation of the Federal Methanol Fleet at Argonne National Laboratory: Citation number 163

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Hydrogen has been successfully and safely handled in the industry for many years.  The safety aspects of hydrogen are intimately related to the specific applications.  New processes and new uses of hydrogen may pose new safety hazards that must be dealt w
ith as they arise.  This document outlines the general areas where the unique properties of hydrogen combine to create potential hazards, and the various techniques and methods commonly practised in industry for the identification, analysis, assessment an
d avoidance of hazards. (Author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

From the well-known problems that have beset the price and supply of crude oil in the last decade have arison many attempts to find alternative energy sources.  In the case of the transportation secto there are a number of feasible fuel alternatives to th
ose which ar petroleum-based, some of which may also prove to be more desirable Current conventional wisdom for Canada has it that there are tw short term alternative fuels, LPG and NG (particularly CNG) and tha there are two additional medium term option
s, methanol and liquid from coal.  Ethanol appears likely to remain too costly and th economics of hydrogen are presently too uncertain to make reasonabl predictions about its use in the transportation sector

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In Denmark there exists some experience and know-how in handling hydrogen especially concerning metal hydride systems. During the 1980s research was carried out at Riso National Laboratory concerning the reaction between hydrogen and different metals. The
work has been as well as own separate projects in collaboration especially with Norsk Hydro and the Institute of Energy Technology in Kjeller, Norway. The experimental work stopped in 1988, as no further financial support was possible. The metal hydrid
e work in Denmark was mainly concentrated on pure magnesium (Mg) and the alloy FeTi, making the stoichoimetric connection FeTiH2. Most of the work was concentrated on Mg, as the material is light and cheap. Magnesium is one of the most common materials in
the earth's crust. The experiments made at Riso showed that magnesium is a material qualified for storage of hydrogen, because the necessary reactions pass off sufficiently fast. Some cycle experiments were made repeating the storage process on the sam
e amount of metal, but with a new amount of hydrogen in each cycle. This was done to see, if the process could be repeated without changing characteristics. Experiments of about thousand cycles showed that the storage capacity decreased as little, but the
velocity for filling and emptying the system was unaffected. Practically this means that the storage material needs to be changed after 1000-1500 storage cycles. (author)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A brief summary is given of two of a series of seminars conducted by the New Zealand Alternative Fuels Association on the testing of natural gas fueled vehicles.  One of the reports discusses the use of infra-red emission analyzers to trouble-shoot NGV op
erating problems.  Changes in exhaust gas composition can be a signpost to identifying possible trouble spots.  The second report discusses work done at the University of Auckland on identifying essentials for maximized power -- unrestricted airflow, matc
hed fuel supply, and optimum ignition timing.  Failures to meet the criteria identified can result in poor vehicle performance

"Its made of mud and plastic and it delivers electricity and water" says David McLeod the "marketing guy" for Ballard Power Systems.  The 'mud' is graphite, layered between a special membrane that splits hydrogen out of methanol fuel to create pollution-f
ree electricity -- lots of electricity.  No fuss, no polluting fumes, no moving parts to wear out; little wonder the VP of Marketing (Government & Military) is exited about what's possibl long-awaited "alternative to the internal combustion engine".  (aut

The objective of this study was to investigate the lube oil requirements for natural gas fueled engines.  This included developing bench test methodology for evaluating and classifying natural gas engine oil performance in key areas such as oxidation, nit
ration, antiwear and deposition.  Used oil degradation patterns were investigated to provide a technology base from which used oil condemnation limits could be established.  Finally, natural gas engine users were surveyed to determine industry practices w
ith regard to maintenance, lubricants used, and oil drain intervals.  (author abstract

Dresser Industries' Waukesha Engine Division is using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to lower NOx emissions from its VHP line of natural gas fueled engines EGR lowers combustion temperature by bleeding off 10% of the exhaust gas and recirculating it thro
ugh a cooler and control valve to the engine's intake, which reduces the amount of NOx formed at any operating point.  The EGR system does not change the engine's performance characteristics and can be applied as a retrofit.  On turbocharged engines, addi
tional NOx reduction is obtained by operating lean where the effect of EGR is more pronounced.  The turbocharger is then rematched to regain the loss of load capability due to lean operation

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Americans drive more now than they ever have.  Although their vehicles are far less polluting than even ten years ago, cities in North America remain polluted from the exhaust of these vehicles.  As a result, cities like New York have considered measures
to reduce the number of vehicles entering the city.  But it is evident from past attempts to restrict traffic that such measures are difficult to put in place.  A more politically palatable solution could be to substitute alternative fuels for gasoline.
This study focuses on the three alternative fuels readily available in New York City: compressed natural gas, methanol, and electricity This report examines financing methods that do not involve government subsidies. This report explores ways to spread th
e high cost of alternative fuels among a number of parties within the private sector.  The emphasis is on structuring partnerships that suit methanol, electric, or natura gas vehicle fleets.  Through these partnerships, alternative fuels may ultimately co
mpete effectively against conventional vehicle fuels.  (from Abstract

Gasoline and natural gas are compared in terms of advantages and disadvantages.  It is felt that many previous studies have given the impression gaseous fuels cannot compete with gasoline, particularly in such areas as emission control, but that this conc
lusion will likely be proved erroneous when all data is available.  Disadvantages such as limited distribution of gaseous fuels, limited fuel-carrying capacity, some regulatory limitations and a need for more highly developed hardware are also identified.
In conclusion however, it is felt that there is a market where conversion will be profitable and that as technological advances are made it should continue to grow

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Propane has been used as an automotive fuel in North America for over three decades.  Growth in its use has tended to come in waves, swelling when L-P Gas, as it is often called, has been in abundant supply and relatively cheap.  Its use has receded in ot
her periods as engines completed their useful lives.  However, the volume consumed as engine fuel has remained significant in spite of more wide-spread use of diesel power, growing petrochemical demand or higher prices.  With greater interest in alternati
ve fuels in recent years, propane continues to be the most widely used gaseous or "alternative" fuel on this continent.  Its future in vehicles is very much a function of its availability and relative price.  The author will outline the supply-demand fact
ors having greatest bearing on its production and use in a free-market environment.  Some comments will be made on the government based initiative to stimulate automotive use in Canada.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper, presented at the 1991 Windsor Workshop on Alternative Fuels (Toronto, Ontario; June 24 - 26, 1991), gives an overview of future transit issues, future propulsion options, OBI natural gas/electric hybrids, and fuel cells.  The material containe
d is for overhead projection.  The conclusions drawn are: transit buses will evolve to meet environmental and social demands, bus propulsion systems will become more complex, capital and operating costs will rise, and transit systems will need new technic
al skills.  (from author introduction and conclusions

This paper provides information on the safety of propane and natural gas fuelled vehicles in Canada. Information is provided on vehicle tests conducted for regulatory-development purposes and also on tests conducted to dermine the compliance of production
vehicles with government safety standards. Data are provided on accidents involving gaseous-fuelled vehicles and judgements on safety are made based on these data. A general conclusion is that if proper attention is paid to the handling of these fuels th
ey are as safe as gasoline.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Policies and programs designed to accelerate adoption of alternative fuel vehicles that were implemented in the 1970s and early 1980s in New Zealand, Brazil and Canada.  The evolution of government and industry programs, the degree of market adoption of a
lternative fuels, and the interaction between the government, industry, and consumers are discussed.  The experience in these countries, demonstrates that it is possible to develop a market for alternative fuels within a reasonable time period if there is
a favorable financial environment and efforts are undertaken to overcome uncertaintly on the part of industry and consumers.  Substantial market penetration requires a strong commitment of effort and resources by the government, particularly in the early
stages of market development, when fuel suppliers, the vehicle conversion industry, and automakers are wary of investing in new technology for which the market is uncertain.  Consumers are reluctant to invest in vehicle conversion, even when the return o
n investment is quite favorable.  Assurance of fuel availability and technical quality of vehicles are also important factors for investors.  (from author abstract

This paper addreses problems related to Canadian utilization of methanol/gasoline blends.  Of particular concern are cold weather operation, water sensitivity to phase separation in winter, and vehicle compatibility -- air-fuel ration control, flexibility
for vehicle movement outside of areas where methanol might be available.  Two vehicles were used for the purposes of this project, a fuel injected Volvo 244DL and a carburetted Chevrolet Monza.  Results of the tests are discussed.  (from author abstract

The report covers the effect of changes in CNG substitution on thermal efficiency, emissions and exhaust temperature for a range of speeds and loads.  Some additional work was performed at light load, high gas substitution to collect more information on p
roposed means of improving the thermal efficiency The trends in the results recorded here are very similar to those recorded on engines previously tested.  There was typically a fall in thermal efficiency as diesel was replaced by natural gas.  The lower
the engine load, the greater the decline in thermal efficiency.  However, work on the light load performance indicated that air intake throttling did not realise the same benefits achieved on the Isuzu 6BDT (reported in the Addendum "Report on Throttling
Tests" ARO/1796 July 1984 (from author introduction 2 appends

This document is the final report of an Energy, Mines and Resources Canada project to document the operating experiences of Black Top Cabs of Vancouver, B.C., and their 128 car fleet which they converted from gasoline to dual fuel NG/gasoline.  Informatio
n on vehicle conversions, the NGV fueling system and long term comparative information on performance from the two fuels is included.  In addition to monitoring performance, driver attitudes were surveyed during the course of the project.  A decided impro
vement in satisfaction was seen between the initial survey two months after the conversion and the final survey after twenty months.  Economic benefits have also resulted from the fleet conversion, and it is estimated (cost of an equivalent volume of gaso
line minus the cost of natural gas, compressor electricity and compressor maintenance) that approximately $75,000 per month is saved.  In addition to this public sale of natural gas provides a valuable addition to revenue

an overall effective gaseous hydrogen fuel supply system for an engine test cell. Various safety measures adopted to combat the systems of undesirable combustion phenomena have been discussed. The paper concludes that hydrogen can be used as a safe fuel.
However, the hydrogen automobile need not be hastily introduced in a large scale without adequately demonstrating its safe operation.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Argonne National Laboratory has completed two full years of operation of 19 vehicles in the Federal Methanol Fleet Project; ten of the vehicles are fueled with methanol.  Over one-half million miles have been accumulated on the fleet vehicles so far, and
comparisons of efficiency continue to show nearly equal performance between the methanol and gasoline vehicles.  Emissions tests of some of the vehicles during the second year revealed degradation of emissions control systems for both the methanol and gas
oline vehicle types, although emissions were still within legal limits.  Methanol vehicles continued to require more maintenance, and the maintenance labor intensity (hours per 1000 miles) increased for all the vehicle types being monitored.  Accumulation
of metals in the lubricating oil of the methanol vehicles continued to be elevated compared to that of the gasoline vehicles although not at alarming levels.  Drivers indicated less satisfaction with vehicles in the test during the second year, both for
methanol as well as gasoline vehicles. (author abstract Results of the First Year of Operation of the Federal Methanol Fleet at Argonne National Laboratory: Citation number 160

The economics of CNG use are importantly determined by type of vehicle and vehicle use.  For example, use for dedicated bus fleets is much more attractive than for passenger cars.  Construction of CNG-dedicated vehicles substantially enhances the economic
s of CNG use.  In general the set of assumptions regarding the context in which CNG is used affects any set of overall conclusions.  Based on a relatively low-cost environment in a developing country, with an existing gas network and CNG distribution faci
lities assumed added to existing stations near an existing pipeline system, the economics of CNG conversion appear attractive for dedicated fleets with crude at current prices or higher, and, in some uses, quite attractive.  For such uses as passenger veh
icles, economic breakeven would not occur unless crude prices are at least twice present levels.  (Author abstract

Motivated by both energy supply and air quality considerations, a substantial technical effort is now being directed towards alternative light vehicle technologies.  This report provides a preliminary assessment of the current and expected role of natural
gas (whose primary component is methane) as an alternate light vehicle fuel, particularly as it compares to gasoline, diesel, and electrical vehicles.  Primary attention in this analysis has been given to passenger automobile applications.  In this summa
ry, the major conclusions of the assessment are first presented.  Following are summaries of the history of gas-fueled engines; brief tehcnical comparisons of natural gas (i.e., methane), gasoline, diesel, and electric engine technologies; performance and
cost comparisons, and a forklift truck case study

Compressed natural gas for vehicles and natural gas conversion to synthetic gasoline are prime targets for New Zealands plans for greater natural gas reserves usage in order to reduce its dependence on imported oil.  Methane produced from green crops coul
d supplement and eventually replace the known natural gas resource which is not expected to last far beyond the end of the century.  Three hectares of crops are converted each year into biogas in a 45 m(3) anaerobic digester at the New Zealand Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries Invermay Research Centre to determine the feasibility of this idea.  The biogas is scrubbed to remove carbon dioxide and the methane is compressed for use in fuelling some of the Centre's vehicles.  After all energy inputs from
planting the crop to compressing the methane have been taken into account, the net energy yield equivalent to 3600 litres of gasoline per hectare per year is produced.  For this energy yield only 4% of New Zealand's land area would be required to complete
ly replace existing natural gas resources from conversion of crops.  Also 5.4% of the land must be cropped in order t replace the annual imports of oil

The Swedish National Board for Industrial and Technical Development (NUTEK) and the Swedish Transport and Communication Research Board (KFB) have recently initiated three interacting and complementary EV and HEV programs: Research on Vehicles and Componen
ts, Demonstration, and Technology Procurement.  The main focus is on HEVs because of their long-term potential for replacing the majority of the total number of conventional vehicles.The research program promoted by NUTEK has the overall aim of develo
ping environmentally acceptable and energy efficient EVs/HEVs.  The activities are mainly directed toward propulsion systems, auxiliary systems, electric current sources and infrastructure.  It is a long-term program involving collaboration between indust
ry and universities/institutes of technology.  The demonstration program was planned by KFB with the purpose gaining experience of EVs and HEVs so as to make it possible to assess their future use and related environmental and infrastructural issues.
The program is planned to be effectuated by municipal bodies/large fleet operators with partial government funding.The technology procurement program initiated by NUTEK acts as third step in the promotion of EVs and HEVs.  The prerequisites for techn
ology procurement of EVs are investigated and preparatory measures for implementation are taken as an introductory step in this program.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Results of a General Motors study of the tailpipe emissions from a variable-fuel Corsica are discussed.  The Corsica Variable Fuel System includes a stainless steel fuel tank, methanol tolerant, high-flow fuel pump, and injectors.  The GM Capacitative fue
l sensor is the key component of the control system.  It measures the dielectric properties of the alcohol-gasoline blends and allows the on-board computer to automatically compensate the fuel quantity based on the energy content of the fuel blend The sli
de presentation made at the Workshop, including a brief paragraph describing each slide, is provided. (from author abstract

This paper, presented at the 1992 Windsor Workshop on Alternative Fuels (Toronto, Ontario; June 15 - 17, 1992), reviews the areas of concern which will effect the future growth of the propane sector.  It is important that prospective clients be identified
, and that established clients must b offered a quality product at an attractive price.  Opportunities exist to expand the number of vehicle types that can use propane and to improve the already good propane vehicle emission performance.  Eight "key oppor
tunities" to become a major player in supplying vehicles for the third largest volume, currently available, automotive fuel in North America are listed.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

As the potential for natural gas vehicles grows in the U.S. a need for more information on environmental concerns such as emissions and safety has emerged.  This study was conducted to document these concerns.  Some of the more significant conclusions rea
ched include:  no nationally recognized safety regulations or standards exist for NG vehicles; compared to gasoline fueled vehicles, the NG vehicles emit less CO, more total HC and less nonmethane HC; NOx emissions can be higher or lower; and, whereas in
some cases NG fueled vehicles have been found to have increased safety risks in comparison to gasoline vehicles, in other cases they have been found to be relatively safe

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Natural gas provides a current, low-cost alternative to the use of gasoline and diesel fuel for highway transportation vehicles.  However, due to the capital costs required to use natural gas as a transportation fuel in either compressed (CNG) or liquefie
d (LNG) forms, some applications are more advantageous than others.  Generally, fleets provide the best opportunity for conversion because of the sheer volume of fuel required and because most vehicles return to a single location each day.  The advent of
small compressors may make conversion to natural gas feasible for private individuals Presently, the most popular conversions are to CNG due to the limited availability of liquefiers to produce LNG.  The available conversion kits favor vehicles with certa
in characteristics:  vehicles should have spark-ignition engines, be large enough to support the weight of the CNG fuel cylinders, consume at least 5 gallons of gasoline each day on average and have sufficient storage volume so that the fuel cylinders do
not infringe on required load-carrying volume.  The ease of conversion depends greatly on the vehicle.  Pickup trucks are usually easy to convert while subcompact cars can present formidable challenges due to space requirements and load-carrying capacity
In this paper, conversion, refueling, and operating and maintenance cost are explained and compiled for the conversion kits and refueling equipmen presently available.  Also discussed is an overview of CNG safety aspects especially as related to road and
operating restrictions that may exist i some local jurisdictions

The Moomba-to-Sydney Australian natural gas pipeline ruptured July 25, 1982 at a point 4.2 km (2.6 miles) from the plant at Moomba.  Laboratory analyses of the failed section predicted the probability of more failures due to stress-corrosion cracking (SCC
) outside the initially replaced first 1 km of line.  As a result, another 20 km of pipeline were replaced and changes made in the line's operating procedures to reduce the risk of further failures due to SCC.  This final part of a three part series concl
udes a discussion of analyses following the pipeline failure.  A failure prediction formula is formulated and the critical role that crack joining plays in a failure is recognized.  (See also citation #1066-part 1 and #1067-part 2

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Maryland Mass Transit Administration (MTA) and Houston transit properties were the first in the U.S. to use liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel. The objectives of the MTA LNG demonstration were to compare LNG to CNG and to clean diesel fuel. The res
ults have shown that the LNG buses have fuel economies of 2.5 to 2.9 miles per diesel gallon equivalent compared to approximately 3.5 mpg for similar diesel buses using diesel fuel. The problems of most concern have been refuelling nozzle freeze on and le
aks.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Vehicle conversion to propane contributes to the national goal of reducing dependence on petroleum.  However most heavy-duty and an increasing number of medium and light duty vehicles are powered by diesel engines for which no propane conversion equipment
is available yet.  Fumigation of propane is limited to relatively low ratios of propane to diesel fuel by high rates of pressure rise.  Total substitution is possible by introducing the propane into the combustion chamber as a liquid spray, however propa
ne has a very low cetane number and will not ignite.  This paper reports on experiments carried out with a single-cylinder Waukesha CRF cetane rating engine (prechamber diesel) fuelled by injected liquid propane.  Fuel injection system modifications neces
sary for handling propane are described.  Performance and emissions data are presented for tests carried out with glow plug ignition.  (From author abstract

The paper will assess the current status of natural gas vehicles, methanol vehicles, ethanol vehicles, and fuels that are blends of petroleum products with alcohols as well as the question of the octane gap in the United States gasoline pool.  This analys
is will be done in the light of strategic as well as economic considerations when analyzing the potential these fuels have to penetrate the market during the remainder of the century.  The main dilemma in the introduction of new fuels is the so-called chi
cken and egg problem.  Main emphasis will be given to the evaluation of the introduction of a new infrastructure with foresight that natural gas can in effect be the forerunner for other future gaseous fuels as well as methanol an ethanol that are based o
n a large array of resources ranging from coal to biomass.  (From author abstract

The initial research efforts focused on durability issues such as ring/liner wear, valve recession, and lubricant oil life relevant to stationary gas engine applications.  Following input from the Gas Engine Technology Advisory Committee, the focus was ch
anged and research was initiated to understand the effect of natural gas fuel composition on engine performance and emissions, engine controls/sensors/actuators and catalyst evaluations.  The durability research was reduced in scope for 1990.  Project acc
omplishments to date are reported.  (from author abstract

Tests were undertaken with a Renault Express 1.4 litre converted to natural gas operation.  The effect of cold starts at cold temperatures and vehicle weight on tail pipe emissions were investigated with petrol and natural gas operation over the FTP75 and
91/441/EEC drive cycles.  The results show that the emissions with natural gas are unaffected by cold temperature, unlike petrol emissions which re several times higher at -15C than at 25C.A crude simulation, accounting for the actual temperature, show
s that the conversion of a significant quantity of light duty vehicles to natural gas operation could reduce the emissions of CO and HC by more than 90% in Switzerland.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Use of natural gas and methanol as transportation fuels has an outstanding potential to reduce urban air pollution in the United States and to promote oil conservation.  Environmental concern is currently the driving force propelling interest in alternati
ve transportation fuels.  Close to one-third of the population lives in areas violating the ozone (smog) or carbon monoxide standards, despite a two-decade long national pollution control effort.  The burning of natural gas and methanol in vehicle engines
emits one-third less, and in some cases up to 90% less, of the key automotive pollutants compared to conventional fuel burning.  Use of alternative fuels can also diversify energy supplies for the transportation sector, which currrently depends on oil to
meet 95% of its demand.  Oil use in transportation has grown since the 1973 oil embargo, erasing much of the decline in oil demand achieved in other economic sectors.  There are only about 500,000 natural gas vehicles operating in the world today and abo
ut 1,000 methanol vehicles, compared to a world population of 386 million cars.  The technology to burn natural gas and methanol in vehicles has been successfully demonstrated, yet it is embryonic and significant obstacles impede widespread commercializat
ion.  As a result, several cities suffering severe pollution problems have recently enacted oxygenated fuels programs which reqire use of ethanol or MTBE fuel blends as a short-term strategy to reduce vehicular air pollution, although fuel blends offer le
ss pollution reduction per vehicle than natural gas or methanol vehicles (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Natural gas is a good fuel for internal combustion engines, but its low energy density is a significant drawback.  The energy density can be increased by adsorption on a high surface area activated carbon.  But with usage, some of the constituents in the
natural gas composition accumulate on the carbon and reduce its adsorptivity.  The adsorption-desorption of natural gas on 9LXC activated carbon was investigated to 100 cycles at 21 C and pressures of up to 12 MPa.  The decrease in the capacity, G, as a f
unction of the number of cycles, N, was found to follow the empirical correlation:  G/G = 1 - 0.085Log(N).  Analysis of the activated carbon after 100 cycles showed accumulation of C4 and higher hydrocarbons but not of C2 and C3.  For automotive applicati
ons, activated carbon appears practical in a narrow pressure range, centering around 7 MPa (1000 psig).  The preferred storage is at a pressure of 17 MPa or higher, without the use of activated carbons

This Nordic Symposium is sponsored by the Nordic Energy Research Programme, which was initiated by the Nordic Council of Ministers (NMR) in 1986. The objective of this programme is to strengthen the scientific base, in Nordic universities and research est
ablishments, within selected areas of energy technology. The programme is not projected-oriented, but supports education and scientific studies in the relevant areas. Its intention is to stimulate Nordic coorperation and the establishment of networks of N
ordic scientists. It is a long term programme, and can be regarded as an investiment in our common (energy) future.

An electronic dual fuel natural gas/diesel conversion system has been developed for the Caterpillar 3406 diesel engine with the Programmable Electronic Engine Control (PEEC) system.  This system is microprocessor based, and interfaces with the Caterpillar
PEEC system to allow control of diesel injection timing as well as fuel quality.  Control of injection timing allows pilot fuel levels as low as 3% at full load, however, to ensure good transient response, minimum pilot level is about 10%.  The completed
system has similar performance to the diesel engine, with comparable efficiency at full load.  Furthermore, the engine's governing characteristics are similar on dual fuel or diesel only operation.  Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon exhaust emissions are h
igher than on diesel, particularly at light load, however, oxides of nitrogen emissions are lower.  Paper no. 911663 in "Alternative Fuels in the Nineties"  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

To facilitate the goal of decreasing oil imports by 10 percent by the year 2000 and 30 percent by 2010, two sections of the Energy Policy Act encourage and mandate alternative fuel vehicles in the acquisition of fleet vehicles.  The first step in estimati
ng the contribution of these mandates toward meeting the aforementioned goal entails identifying affected fleets.  This paper presents a preliminary assessment of potential vehicle fleet coverage.  Only a limited number of companies in the methanol, ethan
ol, and hydrogen industries are likely to qualify for this mandate.  Whereas, many of the oil producers, petroleum refiners,and electricity companies are likely to be regulated.

The author discusses the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and laws applicable to anyone who alters a vehicle which has been certified to applicable FMVSS's.  Any equipment which is changed or added to a vehicle must be certified or the perso
nal responsible is liable for a civil penalty.  The paper discusses sections of the Act which are broken if, for example, the original gasoline tank is removed, or if a gasoline fuel system is converted to a propane fuel system.  The responsibility of the
alterer for safety defects in the equipment or in the method or location of installation is also covered.  Whether or not the alterer is liable under the Act, it is suggested a lawyer be consulted regarding liability in tort

Advanced battery technology evaluations are performed under simulated electric vehicle operating conditions at the Argonne Analysis & Diagnostic Laboratory.  The ADL provides a common basis for both performance characterization and life evaluation with un
biased application of tests and analyses.  This paper summarizes the performance characterizations and life evaluations conducted in 1990 on nine single cells and fifteen 3- to 360-cell modules that encompass six technologies (Na/S, Zn/Br, Ni/Fe, Ni/Cd, N
i-metal hydride, and lead-acid).  This information provides an interim measure of the progress being made in battery R&D programs, a comparison of battery technologies, and a source of basic data for modeling and continuing R&D.  Paper no. 911634 in "Alte

From the outset of CNG utilization in New Zealand, trunk-piston compressors have been considered as an alternate to crosshead-type or hydraulic machines.  The excellent results achieved have given this design a leading position in various countries includ
ing Canada.  The presentation covers the design of the machine, its characteristics and features.  The evolution of the technology from air compressors through industrial gas to the present state-of-the-art pressure-tight unit is followed.  A comparison w
ith the other compressor designs presently utilized in CNG service is made, outlining what these machines have in common and their differences, from a technical, economical or maintenance stand-point.  The selection criterias for such a unit are reviewed
as well as the results from field experience.  (Author abstract

The public information program created by Section 405 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) assists the attainment of goals of other EPACT alternative fuel and alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) programs.  During FY 1994, the Section 405 Program establishe
d a two-tiered structure to review materials produced, and provided three deliverables.  If public information is viewed as following a standard product life cycle, then available promotional tools can be integrated with program themes to produce approach
es tailored to future phases of the program.

vehicle (ULEV), the lowest emitting internal-combustion-engine (ICE)-powered vehicle required by the ARB in the future.  When compared to a conventional vehicle on the road today, EVs provide substantially greater emission benefits.  Furthermore, unlike
a conventional vehicle, an EV will maintain very low emission rates over the entire life of the vehicle. In addition to the extremely low emissions associated with an EV, the overall efficiency of an EV is better than the overall efficiency of a gasoline-
powered vehicle.  Thus, the use of an EV rather than a conventional vehicle results in the use of less energy, decreasing the production of pollutants and providing greater environmental benefit.  By 2010, the ARB's analysis indicates that the existing ze
ro-emission vehicle mandate will results in a five percent decrease in the ozone-forming pollutant emissions from the light-futy fleet.  In future years, as the fleet turns over, the emission reductions from the existing zero-emission vehicle requirements
will approach ten percent.  Should EVs become even more popular, resulting in an increase in the number of EVs sold, the emission reductions could meet or exceed ten percent by 2010 and beyond.

Low-emissioin city route buses with Hino's Diesel-Electric Hybrid system (HIMR system) have been extensively monitored since December 1991.  Various tests were carried out which show favorable results in achieving low emission, including a reduction of su
ch pollutants as NOx and black smoke and impovements in fuel consumption and brake lining wear.  This paper gives the results of the monitor tests.

This report summarizes the results of the neat methanol (M90) fleet test conducted from April 1983 to March 1985 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  The objective of the demonstration was to test and demonstrate the use of neat methanol as an automotive fuel by compa
ring the overall performance of a fleet operating on M90 and one operating on regular unleaded gasoline (RUG).  The M90 fuel consisted of 90% methanol and 10% seasonally adjusted hydrocarbons Six tests were employed in comparing the two fuels: fleet drive
ability, controlled driveability, fleet fuel consumption, chassis dynamometer, oil analysis, and maintenance and failure analysis.  In general, the performance of the methanol optimized Cressidas was comparable to th performance of similar gasoline fueled
vehicles.  The performance of the other fleet vehicles was not as good compared to gasoline fueled vehicles under typical Manitoba climatic conditions. (from executive summary

The current cylinder management arrangements in many countries do not keep track of vehicle or cylinder ownership and the geographic location of vehicles and cylinders. This makes it very difficult to effect a checkup or recall of defective cylinders, mon
itor cylinder safety performance, establish their safety history and enforce timely periodic retesting and disposal at the end of their design service life. In this paper the discussion will be limited to the example of on board cylinders in Australia mak
ing reference to present cylinder management and possible management mechanisms.

In 1983 the Danish Ministry of Energy initiated a project on investigating the feasibility of using CNG as a transport fuel.  The project evaluated the experiences of other countries and used that information as a basis for importing or transferring the n
ecessary technology.  Two demonstration projects using a dual fuel system are running and two more projects are planned for Denmark.  Two problems identified from the experiments were the heaviness of the storage cylinders and the inefficiency of the air
fuel ratio.  The author concludes that  (a) major fleets in urban areas should be targeted for gaseous fuel use and  (b) a clear set of regulations regarding equipment, education of installers and certification of garages etc. be established before consid
eration should be given to the improvement of the technical components

This paper discusses the development of CNG refuelling stations in Canada. From a mere four in 1982 public stations are expected to number over sixty by the end of 1985.  The fact that Canada has a good supply of natural gas domestically and has developed
an excellent distribution network throughout the country are major factors in the growth of its public fuelling stations.  As well, financial incentives by federal and provincial governments, and some gas utilities, have contributed greatly to the number
of CNG vehicules and the need for the stations

fired end-use technologies and a customer for gas in power generation, changes in the electric industry are monitored as part of GRI's strategic planning. With the restructuring of the industry increasing momentum, the potential for fundamental change in
all aspects of the electric  power industry is clear. The uncertainty surrounding the resulting form of specific industry structures and practices makes the development of scenarios a particularly useful approach to R&D planning.Three scenarios were d
eveloped: an accelerated road to intense competition; a slower path to competition involving a more deliberated resolution of key issues; and a third road rejecting competition and taking the industy to a new form of regulation. Key implications for the n
atural gas industry and for GRI are included for each scenario.

A survey was undertaken to access performance and level of public satisfaction with CNG powered vehicles.  The 65 vehicles surveyed were based in the Auckland area of New Zealand.  Approximately 75% or the people surveyed found the power output of their v
ehicle to be satisfactory.  Of the 25% who were dissatisfied, difficult cold starting and loss of power in comparison to gasoline, were the major complaints.  A significant portion of those experiencing power differences were the result of CNG equipment d
eficiencies, the majority of which could be rectified fairly easily

Crossman Propane Co. of San Pedro, Calif., has tested a new Septum system for diesel boosting with propane.  Preliminary road and chasis dynamometer tests demonstrate the system is capable of significant reductions in diesel fuel consumption and smoke emi
ssions.  Improvements were also seen in vehicle driveability and engine noise level.  Results indicate this is a potentially economically sound system

Transcom has an eight year history developing microcomputer control systems that use sequential gas injection to allow the conversion of turbocharged diesel engines to operate on 100 percent natural gas. This paper provides technical details on the Transc
om NGV's installed in a Renault PR100.3 turbocharged under floor bus engine. Variables such as engine speed, throttle position, gas pressure and gas temperature are measured by the engine control unit. Sequential gas injection replaces the use of the carb
uretor. This produces accurate control in the delivery of gas mass, leading to fuel efficiency, and no under or overpowering of the engine.

This overview of the Canadian Federal Hydrogen and Energy Storage program is essentially a review document covering the period from 1979 to 1985 during which the technical management of the program was the responsibility of the National Research Council o
f Canada.The document presents various starting parameters which defined the program scope and the context within which the program was initiated. The mandates of the involved government departments and the data base, energy resource base, intellectual
resource base available at that time are discussed. A major factor determining the program content was the prediction that future availability of oil would decrease and that an increasing fraction of future Canadian energy supply would be produced in the
form of electricity.The overall objective was to ensure Canadian capability in the designated subject areas, and specific objectives were defined in four sub-program areas covering hydrogen production, hydrogen utilization, energy storage, and electroch
emistry research. Strategies for attaining program objectives were tailored to specific circumstances with major influences being resource availability and known levels of research in other countries. A brief summary of the content and context of activiti
es is included.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Natural gas is generally accepted as a promising alternative to petroleum however, conversion kits presently used in diesel fuel systems are outdated and many problems have been encountered in the field especially in cold weather environments.  Conversion
kits were studied and experiments wer carried out at Ecole Polytechnique which led researchers to question the behaviour of the pressure regulator under wide temperature and pressure variations.  In normal operation natural gas undergoes a significant te
mperature drop when it is reduced from storage pressure to atmospheric pressure for admission to the engine.  A computer simulation was carried out of the behaviour of the air/fuel ratio admitted to the engine for a typical conversion kit when ambient tem
perature was varied from -40 C to 35 C and the storage pressure from 1.36 MPa to 20.4 MPa.  The results of the simulation showed that the temperature and pressure variations affect the densities of both fluids and the air/fuel ration can depart widely fro
m stoichiometric.  Due to the narrow range of flammability of natural gas, this can lead to a loss of performance, misfiring and worse driveability.  Thus, it was concluded that air/fuel ratio should be proportioned on a mass basis rather than on the volu
metric basis presently used.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The results of a technical and economic feasibility study of converting vehicles to alternative fuels are presented.  The fleet of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California consists of 47 vans,
22 sedans and 1 pickup truck.  The alternative fuels considered were compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and methanol The vehicles were to operate in a hybrid gasoline/alternative fuel mode. Factor effe
cting fuel choice was generally price, but cost of service factors, i.e. conversion costs, were also considered.  In this study the LPG conversions were found to yield the greatest monetary return and energy conservation

A pumpless four cycle internal combustion engine for lighter-than-air gaseous fuels such as natural gas.  The gas at a controlled low pressure is admitted to a gas chamber adjoining the engine combustion chamber by a check valve during the intake stroke w
hile unthrottled air enters the combustion chamber and is given a swirling motion by suitable means at the air intake valve.  During the compression stroke, the swirling air draws the gaseous fuel from the gas chamber and, due to the lower specific wieght
of the fuel, swirls the fuel spirally toward a centrally located glow plug.  At the end of the compression stroke, the fuel charge is stratified around the glow plug in a concentric pattern whereupon ignition occurs

This paper discusses world gas reserves and the possibility of developing them.  Presently natural gas is predominantly a local fuel.  In 1983, less than 7% of marketed production ever crossed international boundaries and only 0.7% was traded as LNG.  Tho
ugh the resource base, proved reserves, and producing capacity may be known, the economics of getting gas to export markets and using it there continues to be a problem

Four different makes of  Indian cars have been converted to run on compressed natural gas .  The cars also retain the dual fuel option of running on gasoline.  This paper highlights the basis for the design and choice of the CNG conversion system.  The  r
esults  show that with CNG fuel a reduction in engine power of about 15% and a slightly improved fuel efficiency on energy basis.  Reduction in government taxes and suitable encouragement for setting up dispensing facilities will be crucial for making fur
ther progress.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The use of alcohols as octane improvers is increasing as the lead is removed from fuels.  Associated with the use of alcohols is a knock problem, expecially at high engine speeds of 3000 r/min and over.  This is especially dangerous because knock may be i
naudible above the other noises from the vehicle, so there is no warning of the impending danger.  The aim of Octane Requirement (OR) tests is to determine whether an engine can operate free from knock.  This is different from being able to operate satisf
actorily without damage on a gasoline of lesser octane number.  There is no advantage to be gained from using a gasoline of octane number greater than the minimum that an engine can run on satisfactorily.  Octane requirement surveys are carried out in Eur
ope, in the USA, in Japan, and in Australia.  There is no similar program in the Republic at present. (Author abstract)

Forecasts of supply/demand for conventional uses of natural gas through the year 2010 were made as well as an assessment of the potential of several alternative fuel systems and competitive fuels.  Three scenarios were established that addressed probable
environments for the gas supply/demand through 2010.  In all cases, the bulk of natural gas used in U.S. will still be produced in the Lower 48 states.  Significant results of the evaluation to 2010 include: gas will be available and reliable, 25% of gas
produced could come from nonconventional sources, gas-fired cooling, cogeneration and fuel cells may make an impact on gas demand, CNG vehicles are economicially viable but will have limited impact on demand unless much stricter legislation is passed (aut

The high temperature adiabatic diesel emerges as a possible contender for future automotive powerplants.  The powerplant under consideration is the insulated diesel type engine without a cooling system.  A waste heat recovery system is considered for furt
her improvement.  Considerable progress has been made in this technology by many organizations.  Currently the theromdynamics, high temperature tribology, materials, design emissions and performance aspects of the adiabatic engine are being investigated w
orldwide.  The possible role of the adiabatic engine in future automotive type engines, and the rotary Wankel type engine are also presented.  Its potential performance improvement is discussed.  The advantages of the adiabatic engine concept for multi-fu
el capability in direct-fired coal combustion and other degraded fuels are covered.  Finally, the technical problem areas holding back its commercialization are presented. (Author Abstract)

The development and use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel in Sichuan is discussed.  Little research had been undertaken until 1986 when the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Committee set up an NGV research group.  Since its inception this group ha
s been involved in developing NGVs and encouraging the spread of CNG technology.  The Sichuan NGV Group hopes to cooperate with other countries in promoting the use of natural gas as a vehicular fuel

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper provides information on the safety of propane and natural gas fuelled vehicles in Canada. Information is provided on vehicle tests conducted for regulatory-development purposes and also on test conducted to determine the complicance of producti
on vehicles with government safety standards. Data are provided on accidents involving gaseous-fuelled vehicles and judgements on safety are made on these data. A general conclusion is that if proper attention is paid to the handling of these fuels they a
re as safe as gasoline.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report examines the present costs and prices of electric vehicles (EVs) relative to conventional vehicles (CVs), and forecasts future EV costs and prices in the context of domestic regulations and the international marketplace.  The electric vehicle
market survey and production cost analysis performed in this study conclude that by 1998, production costs will drop substantially due to economies of scale, and life-cycle costs of some electric vehicles will be at parity with conventional vehicle.  This
will be a large factor in the succession of the EVs in the future automotive industry.  Expanded market demand for electric vehicles and associated economies of scale are likely to occur not only because of the California, New York and Massachusetts mand
ates, but also because of the Energy Policy Act fleet vehicle requirement, growth in overseas domestic markets, and added consumer interest as prices fall and performance improves.  In addition to the major United States auto manufacturers, smaller domest
ic electric vehicle companies and foreign competitors are prepared to supply electric vehicles to the US market by 1998.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In the spring 1980, Senior Management decided to position Detroit Edison as a major participant in the electric vehicle industry.  Subsequently, a contract was signed in February 1981, initiating a three-year cost-sharing electric car demonstration progra
m between Detroit Edison and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).The objective of this program are (i) develop local and national markets for electric cars (ii) encourage continued improvement in electric car technology (iii) promote Detroit as the cent
er for electric car development (iv) position Detroit Edison as a leader in the electric car industry.Early market research revealed that the "current state of apathy" toward electric vehicles should be disturbed. Consequently, Detroit Edison's program
took a unique position by emphasizing communications while operating a fleet of 24 electric cars, driven by everyday families for everyday activities. The program seeks to position the electric car as "intermediate-range passenger car" and a companion to
an internal combustion engine.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The development of compressed natural gas (CNG) as a vehicular fuel is leading toward new markets for natural gas It takes two things to develop a new market successfully.  One is product suitability--your product must be able to do the thing you are clai
ming it can do.  The second is market acceptability--people have to be convinced that they want, and can obtain, that product.  The development of CNG as a vehicular fuel will depend on the successful combination of these two elements

The object of this study was to investigate the technical and economic feasibility of developing a dual fuel gas/diesel conversion system for two-stroke diesel engines.  The study was divided into 3 basic areas; market analysis, economic analysis and desi
gn of the conversion system The results of the market analysis indicate that urban transit bus fleets would be very well suited to such a conversion and that in Canada there are over 10,000 of these buses, almost all of which use the DDA 6V-71N two-stroke
diesel engine.  Analysis of the engine cycle shows that 70-80% of the diesel fuel used can be replaced with natural gas, providing substantial fuel savings.  As a result, the payback period for the conversion, including installing a refuelling station, r
anges from 1.6 to 2.3 years, depending upon the size of the fleet and the bus duty cycle.  The design study has led to a "timed injection" system where natural gas is mixed with the inlet air as it enters the cylinder through the inlet ports.  Control of
the system is through the normal governor mechanism Based upon the findings, it is concluded that it is both technically feasible and economically desirable to convert two-stroke diesel engines to natural gas with pilot injection and it is recommended to
proceed with Phase II of the program

According to the approved regulations for the Low Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels in 1990, the light and medium duty vehicles will be classified in four new classes.  These classes are as follows:+ transitional low-emission vehicle (TLEV)+ low-emissi
on vehicle (LEV)+ ultra low-emission vehicle (ULEV)+ zero-emission vehicle (ZEV).This report disscusses cost, technology applied, and benefits of the two types of environmentally friendly vehicle;  low-emission vehicle and zero-emission vehicle we
re the two disscussed.  Few aspects of the disscussion are cost methodology, cost effectiveness, future technologies, emission control technology, and environmental benefits.

This paper presents results of tests undertaken on two vehicles converted to propane fuel.  The focus of the paper was to determine the impact of decreasing temperatures on exhaust emissions.  It was determined that at normal temperatures propane could on
ly meet gasoline exhaust emission standards.  At cool/cold start conditions however, propane showed significant improvement over gasoline

Stimulated by environmental regulations affecting new vehicle emission control guidelines, as well as national plans to comply with standards set by the Clean Air Act, the gas industry through the Gas Research Institute, is developing and implementing a R
&D program that will ensure the viability of natural gas as a competitive option as a transportation fuel.  This paper discusses how and why the program was undertaken, and describes briefly various areas in which work will be undertaken.  To date, the GR
I R&D program has targeted heavy-duty vehicle applications for initial study, specifically the development of a high performance, spark ignited, dedicated NG engine for buses.  Other major program areas identified include:  medium/heavy duty fleet vehicle
s, light duty vehicles, on-board NG storage systems, and vehicle refueling systems

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A bi-fuel engine capable of operating either on compressed natural gas (CNG) or gasoline is being developed for the transition to alternative fuel usage.  A Saturn 1.9 liter 4-cylinder engine was selected as a base powerplant.  A control system that allow
s closed-loop optimization of both fuel delivery and spark timing was developed. Stock performance and emissions of the engine as well as performance and emissions with the new controller on gasoline and CNG, have been documented.  It is the goal of this
research to use the knock resistance of CNG to recover the associated power loss.  A turbocharger was installed to increase the density of the intake charge and thereby regain the volumetric efficiency lost with CNG.  A wastegate was electronically contro
lled to allow precise control of the engine performance.  Equivalent power to gasoline operation with CNG was achieved with the turbocharger. It was necessary to bypass the turbocharger during gasoline operation, on both the inlet and exhaust sides, to av
oid knock.  Reductions from baseline in hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were achieved at power levels equivalent to and slightly higher than the baseline.  Brake thermal efficiency values were not significantly different in any case.

The turboexpander process is replacing the oil absorption process as the main process used for extracting ethane or ethylene and heavier hydrocarbons from gas streams.  Because of its simplicity, which makes skid-mounting and modular design very attractiv
e, and its minimal power requirements, the turboexpander process is ideally suited to plants located at remote, isolated sites.  This article deals primarily with how the turboexpander process works and its many applications to date. (From Author Abstract

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), under the auspices of the Alternative Fuels Utilization Program has been managing the Federal Methanol Fleet Project since its beginning in fiscal year 1985.  This congressionally mandated project directed the Dep
t. of Energy to introduce methanol-fueled vehicles into civilian government fleet operations.  This interim report describes the second year's operation of the methanol fleet at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California.  The fleet consists of
5 1984 methanol-fueled Chevrolet Citation sedans paired with 5 gasoline-fueled Citations for comparison.  Data has been collected and tabulated on fuel consumption, maintenance records, oil sample analyses, and driver perceptions of vehicle operability.
Fuel efficiency was slightly improved as compared to the first year for both methanol and gasoline vehicles, which may be due partially to a greater sensitivity of the part of users about methanol vehicle problems.  Oil sample analyses revealed that engin
e wear rates are lower for the second year as compared to the first year and are probably not cause for great alarm.  Drivers still rate all of the vehicles quite highly, but the methanol vehicles were rated not as highly during the second year of operati
on as in the first year (author abstract 1 fig., 16 tabs., 5 refs

This paper, presented at the 1992 Windsor Workshop on Alternative Fuels (Toronto, Ontario; June 15 - 17, 1992), outlines the supply and demand picture for propane in North America.  Propane is the most used alternative fuel in the world, with a distributi
on network in place across North America and a well established market.  Only CNG has a better supply than propane and no other alternative fuel has a well developed infrastructure or the high level of supply.  Detailed here are the supply and demand stat
istics for propane for Canada, the United States and the world.  Projections for the future situation are also included.  (from author introduction

This paper summarizes the results of lobbying efforts to secure a bioethanol program in the European Economic Community.  In 1987-88 two events were the focus of attention in this endeavor, 1) the publication of a feasibility study of a bioethanol program
and the EEC, and 2) the debate on the reform of the Agricultural Policy which entailed alternative solutions with which the costs of a bioethanol program can be favorably compared.  Overall it is believed the European Council has recognized the potential
of using renewable raw materials rather than finite ones as fuels

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Natural gas can be used as a vehicular fuel, but its low energy density is a significant drawback.  The energy density can be increased by adsorption of the natural gas on high surface area sorbents.  The adsorption of methane on activated carbons and mol
ecular sieves was investigated at pressures up to 16 MPa (2300 psig).  The improvement in methane storage capacity over empty cylinders is appreciable at low pressures but diminishes as the pressure increases.  When adsorbed, for example, on 9LXC activate
d carbon at 3, 7, and 14 MPa the energy density increased by 245%, 100%, and 53%, respectively.  Less improvement was observed with molecular sieves

Reported are the latest advances in portable and electric vehicle batteries, with particular emphasis on breakthroughs in specific energy. In this regard, we also provide comparison to other systems such as primary alkaline, reusable alkaline, and lithium
-ion. The focus is on increasing energy even further and reducing cost. By combining advanced metal hydride alloys and improved nickel hydroxide materials, next generation Ovonic NiMH will exceed 120 Wh/kg. At a production volume of 20,000 electric vehicl
es per year, 120 Wh/kg specific energy will equate with a selling price of $150/kWh.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Dimethyl ether has high vapor pressure and wide flammability limits, which make it an excellent fuel for cold starting methanol engines. We have investigated the catalytic dehydration of methanol to produce dimethyl ether on board methanol fueled vehicles
. We tested four methanol dehydration catalysts in a microcatalytic plug flow reactor and found that a flourinated gamma alumina was active and selective for methanol dehydration in the 250-350 deg C (482-662 deg F) temperature range. We also tested the f
luorinated gamma alumina catalyst with a 15 % gasoline /85 % methanol mixture (M85) and found that the catalyst activity decreased in proportion to the gasoline content but that no catalyst deactivation occurred. Data from the catalyst testing were used t
o design an electrically - heated methanol dehydration reactor that could be used on board a methanol fueled vehicle. (author)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This project was undertaken to study the effect that alternative fuels, in particular natural gas, can have on national energy security in the U.S.  The threat of severe oil supply disruption as predicted by analysts for as early as the 1990's, could rava
ge the U.S. economy.  This study examines the alternatives as affected by the energy resources located nationally.  At present approximately 95% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. is from U.S. sources, and 99.8% is from North American sources.  With
such a great resource potential recommendations are made that many federal government and domestic military base vehicle fleets be converted to natural gas fuel.  Large demonstration projects are recommended in order to achieve prompt progress

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The purpose of the paper is to address potential convertors' concerns about the future availability and pricing of this fuel.  To this end, reference will be made to its supply, demand and pricing at present and over the forecast period.  The current situ
ation will be described in terms of the logistics of the supply, transportation and distribution systems as well as existing pricing and demand patterns and institutional anomalies.  The projections will rely on forecasts done by government agencies such
as the National Energy Board and Energy, Mines and Resources.  In order to give adequate context to these projections, references will be made to international supply, demand and prices and the transfer mechanisms by which they are expected to impact on t
he Canadian market.  The anticipated forecast period wil be 1986-2005. On to this background will be superimposed the anticipated transportation demand for energy with emphasis on the markets that show most promise for these fuels and the reaons why.  The
estimated market penetration will be a function of the relative prices of this fuel, compared to conventiona fuels, technology, possible perceptual and institutional constraints and government energy and taxation policies. (Author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The hydrogen supply for motor vehicles is not necessarily connected with the development of its own infrastructure in the form of hydrogen pipeline networks. It can be shown that the existing infrastructures for electricity, gas and water for centralized
and decentralized generation of hydrogen can be utilized practically in terms of energy. The technical possibilities for decentralized generation of hydrogen and its use as an auxiliary fuel to extend the gasoline suppliers are described and discussed.

By December 1, 1990 the sale of leaded gasoline will, for the most part, be discontinued in Canada.  In some older vehicles and motor-powered equipment designed for leaded gasoline, the use of unleaded fuel could result in valve seat recession.  This repo
rt examines valve seat recession and discusses various solutions. (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Rupture discs are membranes designed to burst at some pre-determined pressure which are widely used to relieve overpressure in chemical processing equipment.  The original experimental work on rupture discs by Bonyun in 1935 demonstrated that a rupture di
sc burst point can be predicted using the equation x = cy-1 where x is the disc diameter, and y is the pressure.  Values of c for various materials and material thicknesses were reported based on experimental data.  This is the basis for today's common pr
actice of bursting one disc per manufactured lot, and then assigning that pressure rating, with a tolerance, to the discs in the lot.  Bonyun's work also reported data which confirmed earlier National Bureau of Standards finding that the hold-down flange
on a rupture disc must have a curved shoulder at the disc if the disc is to fragment rather than shear break at its edge

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A 260 kilowatt (Kw) propane engine suitable for installation in a Class 8 highway tractor has been developed.  The engine is based on a 14 litre Cummins "Big Cam" propane engine used for stationary applications.  Modifications to the ignition, fuel and go
vernor system were introduced allowing transient operation of this engine over its entire speed and load range.  Combustion chamber pressures are significantly lower on propane compared to diesel.  Fuel consumption data were collected with a diesel and pr
opane engine, on a computer controlled dynamometer, over a defined duty cycle.  The increased volumetric fuel requirement on propane is due to a lower heating value of propane and lower thermodynamic efficiency.  The engine was installed in a Class 8 truc
k with a maximum GVW rating of 59,000 Kg.  During 1985 and 1986, a consumption and maintenance activity were recorded and compared to a similar diesel powered truck.  Suggestions for possible improveents n this first generation propane engine will be made

The characteristics of an engine which is ideally suited for methane-fuel operation are discussed.  After a brief discussion of the history of methane fuel, a summary of its advantages and disadvantages is presented.  Factors covered include emissions, ec
onomy, range and driveability.  Various developments in the design of automotive engines are then analyzed in terms of their correlation with an ideal methane-fueled engine.  Engine developments considered include: knock control strategies; designs to enh
ance the lean-burn and fast-burn characteristics of an engine; pre-chamber or torch-ignition engines; direct-injection stratified-charge engines; and, diesel engines

A surfactant has been found that is effective in preventing phase separation of alcohol-petroleum fuel mixtures.  It is described herein, along with the test procedures used to determine its effectivenss.  These methods included exposing samples to the at
mosphere until phase separation occurred; adding water to prepared samples maintained at a fixed temperature to induce phase separation; and cooling samples to achieve phase separation.  Differences between "cloud point" and "phase separation point" are n
oted.  Differences in performance between gasoline-alcohol mixtures and diesel fuel-alcohol mixtures are also examined and reported

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The minimum spark ignition energy in methane-air mixtures was measured for pressures between 0.1 and 0.4 atm and methane concentrations near the lean ignition limits.  Spark gap sizes between 2 and 10 mm and spark durations between 70 and 120 us and a max
imum spark energy of 600 mJ were used to identify lowest ignited methane concentrations.  These concentrations were found in good agreement with previous measured lower limits of flammability using similar apparatus. (Author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Existing natural gas vehicle engines are fuelled through the intake manifold, in a way similar to the gasoline engines. As the result, such engines are essentially less powerful than their gasoline counterparts. To obtain higher engine power and efficienc
y, direct gas injection could be used. The described research shows the recent progress in the development of particular components for direct gas injection: thermocontrolled compressed gas tank, solenoid operated injectors and ignition chamber installed
in the cylinder head.

The author discusses the application of spark-ignited gas engines to such services as gas transmission, gas gathering and chemical processing with integral angle engine-compressors as well as directly coupled units.  The author also treats such performanc
e aspects of two- and four-stroke cycle spark-ignited gas engines as:  fuel consumption, cyclic dispersion in combustion, accommodation of ambient temperature variation, load variation and altitude.  There is an extended discussion of pulse and constant p
ressure turbocharger characteristics and their influence on engine performance.  Important hardware considerations are given, such as design of valves and valve inserts, cylinder heads and pistons

To discuss the development and application of non-lubricated, horizon- tally balanced/opposed compressors for CNG refuelling.  It will review experience gained in North America and New Zealand.  It will detail the engineering differences in the design and
operation of non-lubricated cylinders compared to fully lubricated cylinders.  When considering the options available today for CNG compressors, time needs to be spent taking into account the differences in operation and maintenance.  This paper reviews
the short and long term economics, plus the practical advantages for the CNG refuelling system in using non-lubricated compressors.  (Author abstract

This paper discusses the need for a home-rechargeable natural gas commuter car and the obstacles involved.  Compressed natural gas (CNG) provides insufficient range and inadequate recharging time when used as  fuel for automobiles, therefore a solution pr
oposed would be to add a completely compatible standby or reserve fuel in LP gas that would allow for emergency use to extend the vehicle range and would be easily refillable for use during extended trips.  The production and distribution system for the f
uel used in the proposed home-fueled compressed natural gas commuter vehicle already exists and the only missing elements are a home compressor and a mass produced vehicle which is specifically designed with  high compression engine to take advantage of t
he high octane of the gaseous fuels

One of the factors impeding the introduction of new transportation fuels is the absence of retail outlets selling those fuels.  Surveys of gasoline and diesel car drivers were conducted to explore several hypotheses regarding refueling attitutes and motiv
ational concerns of motorists, and the importance of fuel availability in the decision to purchase nonpetroleum vehicles.  Insights and findings resulting from this survey are discussed (From author abstract)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Progress of the development and validation of a CFD model for diesel engine combustion and flow is described.  A modified version of the KIVA code is used for the computations, with improved submodels for liquid break-up, drop distortion and drag, spray/w
all impingement with rebounding, sliding and breaking-up drops, wall heat transfer with unsteadiness and compressibility, multistep kinetics ignition and laminar-turbulent characteristic time combustion models, Zeldovich NOx formation, and soot formation
with Nagle Strickland-Constable oxidation.  Model validation experiments have been performed using a single-cylinder heavy duty truck engine that features state-of-the-art high pressure electronic fuel injection and emissions instrumentation.  In addition
to cylinder pressure, heat release, and emissions measurements, combustion visualization experiments have also been performed using an endoscope system that takes the place of one of the exhaust valves.  Experiments have also been conducted to study the
effect of injection characteristics, including injection pressure and rate, nozzle inlet condition and multiple injections on engine performance and emissions.The intake flow CFD modeling results show that the details of the intake flow process influe
nce the engine performance.  Comparisons with the measured engine cylinder pressure, heat release, soot and NOx emission data, and the combustion visualization flame images show that the CFD model results are generally in good agreement with the experimen
ts.  However, further work is needed in order to improve the accuracy of predictions of combustion with late injection, and to assess the effect of intake flows on emissions.

The performance of an SI engine with ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) as a blending component was investigated in comparison with other blending components: ethanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).  With oxygenated fuel blends of 2.0 and 3.5 wt %
oxygen content, parametric studies were carried out on emission levels and the overall performance with a General Motors Quad-4 engine.  The results of the experiments and the numerical simulation with a computer program, show that the new blending compon
ent ETBE, can be compared favorably with the performance and emissions of the base gasoline, ethanol and MTBE. (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Results of work done by the Volkswagon Research Division in Germany on pure-alcohol engines are presented.  A series of tests were conducted to study the behavior of various fuels in specially tuned engine concepts.  Work was carried out on a 1.6 liter, 4
-cylinder engine with:  compression ratio 8.2:1 (production), with gasoline and methanol, carburetor operation; and, compression ratio 12.5:1, with ethanol and methanol, carburetor and fuel injection system.  A summary of results includes: alcohol-gasolin
e blends permit higher engine efficiencies and lower exhaust emissions than gasoline fueled engines; the cylinder pressure indicating provides information on the advantageous behavior of alcohol fuels; and, alcohol fuels that attain the necessary characte
ristics by the addition of other components with higher volatility realize the most economically favorable fuel-engine concept

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The smoke point has been shown to be quantitatively related to the molecular structure of hydrocarbon fuels.  A fast technique of determining molecular composition of commercial and experimental fuels, in terms of carbon type structure, by using a proton
nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry has been described.  By measuring the smoke point soot yields of laminar diffusion flame with a group of fuels all having a constant hydrogen to carbon ratio, it has been shown that neither the smoke point nor hydro
gen to carbon ratio alone can describe the sooting propensities of turbine fuels.  This has been further tested using the available data in literature obtained from gas turbine combustors and diffusion flames. (Author Abstract)

A research program was conducted to determine the effects of thermal barriers in the combustion chamber on emissions and combustion of a direct-injection diesel engine operated on selected alternate fuels.  Steady-state exhaust emissions, cranking charact

Natural gas engines have seen rapid growth in the last ten years due to the ease of fuel access and also because of a competitive price advantage.  With the increase in use it has become imperative that lubrication issues be addressed.  The oil industry h
as tried to address some of the problems with the use of additives.  Viscosity increase has been counteracted with the addition of Zinc Dithiophosphates and ashless oxidation inhibitors.  Engine wear has resulted in the addition of wear inhibitors, metall
ic detergents, and Zinc Dithiophosphates, while engine deposits reduction requires the minimization of ashless dispersants and metallic detergents.  Other issues such as catalyst phosphate contamination from engine oil are also areas of concern.  Presenta
tion is in outline format.  (author abstract

An engine simulation model has been developed to describe turbulent combustion of gas-air mixtures in a spark-ignition engine.   The model incorporates a turbulent entrainment combustion theory proposed by Daneshyer and Hill which is based on Tennekes' mo
del of turbulence and the vortex bursting principle of Chomiak.  Flame propagation was based on turbulent entrainment.  The flame was modelled as a thick spherical shell composed of burned and unburned gases.  To compare the model to experimental data, tu
rbulence levels were measured in a motored Ricardo Hydra engine using hot wire anemometry.  Results indicate that the model is successful in predicting trends in overall combustion rates when the engine speed and air-fuel ratio are varied

This paper reviews the literature for methods of increasing fuel flexibility in diesel engines over a range of fuel properties representing alcohols to high viscosity diesels.  It was conceived that the details of fuel-charge within the engine cylinder wo
uld help evaluate the requirements for multi-fuel engine design.  It is therefore, attempted to model in-cylinder flows, fuel-air mixing and fuel property effects.  The preliminary results of these calculations are presented

During the past ten years natural gas for motor vehicles in New Zealand has moved from being an experimental fuel in gas undertaking vehicles to one that is widely available form over 350 public refuelling stations, supplying approximately 120,000 vehicle
s This transition was achieved during a period of rapid increases in petrol prices, and with the financial support of central government.  Extensive early planning and market evaluation identified the factors which had to be coordinated and controlled to
move from the initial developmental phase into the phase of market growth The present phase is now one of comsolidation for NGV petrol vehicles with the additional phase of growth in NGV diesel vehicles envisaged as being superimposed in the near future t
o give further overall growth in NGV sales Many of the factors being considered as necessary for this NGV petrol consolidation and NGV  diesel growth are also relevant to the future of NGV development programmes in other countries (Author summary 7 refs.,

A study was undertaken to understand the effects of certain operating parameters on piston ring wear in a natural gas engine.  Engine speed, oil type (by percent zinc content), coolant temperature, and peak cylinder pressure were defined as the operating
parameters to be characterized.  The radioactive tracer technique allowed in situ wear measurement and was the method of choice.  Using this approach, irradiated ring wear debris were monitored on a real-time basis via measurement of radioactivity increas
e in the lubricating oil.  Though several tests were promising, this technique was not successful.  Troubleshooting steps indicated that the single-cylinder LABECO engine caused radioactive wear debris to fall out of suspension and subsequently avoid dete
ction by the wear measurement equipment.  SwRI is funding its own internal investigation into this theory and will supply GRI with the results

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A regulator in the fuel system of a vehicle's internal combustion engine regulates the fuel pressure of a gaseous fuel, such as natural gas, to a fuel-air mixer.  The regulator maintains a predetermined fuel pressure for idle and cruise conditions and inc
reases fuel pressure to effect an enriching of the air-fuel ratio for full throttle conditions.  The degree of enriching is sufficient to pass through a region where there is a threat of exhaust valve burning and where the maximum amount of the oxides of
nitrogen are produced.  The change in air-fuel ratio is extremely rapid to avoid operation for any material amount of time in this region.  The regulator also effects a change from a rich air-fuel ratio to a lean one at a predetermined point in throttle s
etting below the point at which enriching occurs

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

By looking at NGV projects today, an attempt is made to draw guidelines for countries' attitudes and choices which may accelerate NGV development.  Efforts have focused on improving CNG technologies, equipment, and craftmanship in engine retrofitting.  Fo
ur points are made.  First, there will not be an international market until gas dedication is here.  Secondly, it must be realized that CNG, and its cylinders, is not the only way to bring gas to vehicles.  Third, performance will increase and cost decrea
se from mass production by a number of competing manufacturers.  Last, however technologically advanced NGVs become, there will always remain some gas-inherent inconveniences and extra costs

A unilateral action by B.C. Hydro to reduce fleet exhaust emissions to the minimum practical level would not, in itself, result in a significant improvement in air quality.  This is because B.C. Hydro operates fewer than 0.1% of the vehicles in the Lower
Mainland.  However, an opportunity exists to 'lead by example', and to provide technical assistance to other fleet owners This report describes the options currently available to B.C. Hydro for reducing emissions from its vehicle fleet.  It has been summm
arized from a group of eight technical studies completed in September 1989 for B.C. Hydro's Environmental Resources Division.  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

We report findings from a recent survey of California households who buy new cars.  This study is designed to predict and explore the potential market for alternative fueled vehicles with special emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs).  Based on preliminary
results from the first 175 returned surveys, we find a much larger market for EVs than have many previous surveys.  This findings is attributed to the sophisticated survey design based upon two years of preliminary research into understanding EV market ba
rriers.  The most important of these barriers is consumers' lack of understanding of the impact of limited range and home recharging on their lifestyles.  If our final results are borne out by the initial findings presented here, then enough new car-buyin
g households in California would choose to buy EVs to meet the 1998 ZEV sales mandates.  We expect 450 completed returns and will update and expand our results at the time of the conference in December 1994.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A series of TONE (Throttleless Otto-cycle Natural-gas engine) performance tests were carried out at Princeton using a modified 2.5 liter, 4 cylinder GM engine with an electrical heater to heat the intake air.  Additional experiments were carried out at So
uthwest Research Institute (SwRI) using a 2.3 liter Ford engine.  TONE uses preheating and leaning out of charge mixture to substitute for the conventional method of throttling to lower the brake output at partial load, thus eliminating the throttling los
s in the intake cycle and improving the overall fuel consumption.  TONE can improve brake efficiency by as much as 15% over the conventional throttle-controlled engines at 30% of maximum load.  Substantial improvements in NOx performance were also found.
For example, NOx emissions were lower by a factor of nearly 30 at 30% of maximum load.  Tests using EGR rather than intake air preheat were also performed but the performance was markedly inferior to that of TONE. (from author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

One of the major safety features of LNG facilities is the impounding system, which consists of drainage and collection areas for accidental LNG releases.  If LNG is spilled and ignited in an impoundement system however, a trench fire will occur.  The purp
ose of this study was to develop and verify a model which accurately predicts thermal radiation flux which might result from such a fire, and to determine the adequacy of the thermal radiation model in 49 CFR 193 for specifying the thermal exclusion zone
for LNG trench fires

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This is a report on the success of the Southern California Gas Co. CNG conversion program.  It is reported that conversion to a dual fuel natural gas system can be accomplished with minimum change in administrative maintenance practices.  Vehicle maintena
nce costs remain essentially the same as with straight gasoline operation, but it is thought that engine life may be prolonged.  Benefits such as reduced fuel costs are significant.  Southern California Gas has also found driver acceptance has increased a
nd that in times of gasoline shortage operational flexibility was increased due to their dual fuel capacity which allowed them to continue to serve their customers without disruption

The environmental and economic aspects of the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel in Italy are discussed in this paper.  Nuovo Pignone has proposed a methane fuel modification of one of Florence's city transport system buses, an idea which has bee
n met with interest.  A discussion of how this proposal would be carried out, experimentation which has taken place and conclusions reached are included.  This paper also covers fueling of fleet vehicles, particularly a station developed by Nuovo Pignone
called 'Cubogas'

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The total number of vehicles fuelled with compressed natural gas, CNG, is relatively very small in comparison to gasoline fuelled vehicles. Accordingly, because of the lack of statistics of accidents involving CNG fuelled vehicles, their safety aspects ar
e evaluated in comparison to automobiles fuelled with gasoline or some other alternative fuels such as propane, hydrogen, LNG or LH2. It is suggested that methane, CNG, has some excellent physical, chemical, and combustion characteristics that make it a s
afe automotive fuel. These characteristics are reviewed and the superior relative safety of methane in automative applications in comparison to applications involving the other fuels is demonstrated where well designed conversion systems and operations ar
e employed.

Concerns about air pollution and energy security have stimulated interest in alternative automotive fuels and in vehicles that can use multiple fuels and combinations of fuels.  Consumer behavior in the choice of motor fuel for flexible-fuel vehicles is l
ikely to be a key factor in the creation and stability of markets for new fuels.  Price, legal restrictions, and fuel quality are identified as key factors in consumer selection and use of fuels.  (from author abstract

The Puget Sound's second largest city Tacoma, has become a trend setter for a change.  In the mid-1980's when Seattle's transit agency decided to try a demonstration project using methanol, Tacoma's Pierce Transit started a diesel/compressed natural gas p
roject.  In a major role reversal Seattle got the headaches, while Tacoma became a national NGV pioneer.  Pierce Transit is creating the nations largest fleet of natural gas buses -- they expect to have 50 buses on the streets of Tacoma by 1992. (from aut

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This study assesses the power, fuel consumption, emissions and other engine parameters of a representative heavy-duty engine (Ford 6.lL LIMA) when converted to natural gas fuel.  Three available designs of carburetion systems were selected -- CNG, DFC, an
d Garretson.  When compared to baseline values on gasoline the maximum power developed using NG is 6 to 15% lower than for gasoline.  Emissions are generally lower with NG.  Though some improvements in power and fuel economy were seen through timing and a
ir-fuel ratio optimization, this low compression ratio engine is not particularly sensitive to these parameters.  It is recommended that to see the full potential of natural gas as an automotive fuel, drastic changes are needed in engine construction and
calibration.  (Phase I - C 0324

The first part of this paper is an overview of the natural gas vehicle market and industry throughout the world.  The paper is based on information which has been collected from a variety of sources, especially members of the International Association for
Natural Gas Vehicles.  The paper commences with a review of the numbers of vehicles which have been converted in various countries Numbers and types of vehicles are discussed, plus ownership and the source of equipment for vehicle conversion.  The number
s of refuelling stations in those countries is given and the source of equipment.  The balance of the first part of the paper deals with the price of fuel, the attitude of vehicle manufacturers, and the attitude of governments The second part of the paper
deals with the global situation with regard to the potential market for NGV and some important factors which affect the realisation of that potential (Author introduction Includes brief author biography

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A number of 1981 reports and news items are reviewed and correlated in this paper in order to link the life-cycle costs of the electric vehicle (EV) with its potential marketability. Recent test data show that the EV is currently more expensive to operate
than the internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). The assessment of future markets will be modified by these results. Significant improvements are needed in battery performance and cost to enable the electric vehicle to reach a competitive level with i
nternal combustion engine vehicles. The progress achieved in near-term battery developments is reviewed and assessed. Some governments appear to be de-emphasizing their financial support of electric passenger cars.

Extensive tests were carried out between 1952 and 1956 at Ingersoll-Rand Co. to compare the performance of a spark ignition 4-cycle engine using a number of different fuels.  Methane, propane, iso-butane, normal-butane, hydrogen and various mixtures of th
ese fuels were tested.  Some of these test results are described, as well as field experiences with unusual fuels in larger engines, both naturally aspirated and supercharged

New Zealand has been actively involved with a program to develop self-sufficiency in liquid fuels for the last decade.  A number of indigenous fuels have been developed and, for the most part, used in the place of petrol rather than diesel.  This paper di
scusses the need for a balanced scenario for the substitution of both petrol and diesel fuel.  It also examines the merits and possible future options for fuels such as natural gas, LPG, methanol and naturally occurring fats and oils

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The price differential between natural gas and gasoline as well as safety, environmental and national oil independence benefits create a substantial incentive to use natural gas as a vehicular fuel.  For the most part natural gas is being used in a dual-f
uel mode to fuel vehicles which currently use either gasoline or diesel fuel.  It is also more attractive to high mileage fleet vehicles operating with a base station for refuelling. The vehicle conversion costs and performance penalties of converted vehi
cles may be reduced through research and development.  The Gas Research Institute (GRI) is initiating a research and development programme on compressed natural gas (CNG) applications in 1986.  Five key areas of research have been defined:  (1) CNG techno
logy base development (2) advanced CNG fuelling system developments (3) enhanced CNG storage systems (4) natural gas compressor advancements (5) dedicated natural gas vehicle development.  (From author abstract

S.E.A. in Murzzuschlag Austria, the company which is developing the EXXON-based Zinc-Flow-Battery since 1983, has been acquired by Powercell-Corporation, Boston with the goal to erect a yearly production facility for about 150,000 kWhs within 1995.  After
the description of the principle and of the battery components battery data and advantages of the system is shown.  The potential to be a serious candidate for a EV-battery is demonstrated on full size batteries with capacities of up to 45 kWh as well as
through comparisons achieved with competitive battery-systems tested in the same cars.  Results and consequences for the Zinc-Flow-Systems are discussed.

Texas is home to four of the nation's 22 metropolitan areas with the most unhealthy air. As the state struggles to meet the standards mandated under the federal clean air act amendments of 1990, the Texas general land office is working to encourage the us
e of clean burning, domestic alternative vehicle fuels. This paper describes the attempt to improve the air quality of Texas via the use of alternative fuels. Various topics are discussed: historical perspective, Texas's plan for clean air, economic advan
tages, environmental advantages, federal legislation, and complaints about alternative fuels.

This newspaper article discusses the Government of New Zealands committment to endorsing CNG as the preferred alternative to gasoline as an automotive fuel.  It includes information on the economic basis for the Governments stand, as well as statistics on
conversions, fueling stations and costs and benefits.  The Author suggests the successful program initiated by the New Zealand Government could be applied to both less developed countries such as Columbia, Equador and Pakistan, as well as industrialized
countries such as Canada, if the natural resources are ther and the Government is willing to make a committment

This paper, presented at the 1992 Windsor Workshop on Alternative Fuels (Toronto, Ontario; June 15 - 17, 1992), reviews the effect of transport fuel consumption on the environment.  Transport fuel consumption is the prime cause of greenhouse and non-green
house gas emissions arising from the sector.  Atmospheric emissions from transport sector fuel consumption include direct greenhouse gases (i.e. those which are radiatively active - CO2, N2O, CH4, CFCs) as well as greenhouse gas precursors.  GHG emission
reduction options are discussed here on a least-cost basis and prioritized in terms of short-term and long-term development opportunities. (from author introduction

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Province of BC requires all light duty vehicles in the lower mainland to pass or conditionally pass an emissions inspection as a condition of license and insurance renewal.  Vehicles converted to natural gas and propane fail emissions tests at higher
rates than comparable vehicles run on gasoline.Work is described to investigate the emissions performance of vehicles fitted with after-market conversions.  FTP 75, Hot 505 and BC AirCare test cycles (total 74) were performed on a variety of vehicles (t
otal 20) which were split between dual-fuel and mono-fuel using propane or natural gas along with gasoline.  All but three vehicles were supplied by the manufacturer to run on gasoline with closed-loop air/fuel ratio feedback.  The after market conversion
s consisted of both open-loop and closed-loop feedback systems for the gaseous fuel systems.  The emissions performance of current gaseous fuel control technology against pre-1993 technology and the operation of dual-fuel vehicles on both fuels against or
iginal gasoline performance or against the vehicle's emissions standards were assessed.  The open-loop control systems on two vehicles were upgraded to closed-loop systems and the improvements in emission performance were demonstrated.

The use of micron size, hollow, glass spheres as a container for high pressure hydrogen was proposed by Robert J. Teitel Associates in 1977. Hydrogen is admitted and dispensed from the spheres by permeation through the glass walls of the microsphere. The
rate of hydrogen transfer depends upon the hydrogen pressure gradient across the microsphere wall, the temperature, the glass composition and the microsphere dimension. This report summarizes the accomplishments on microsphere bed preparation, screen test
s and optimization tests. Recommendations for future studies were derived from a review of all the Department Of Energy funded experimental information accumulated thus far.

Combustion Duration is one of the key parameters affecting performance of an internal combustion engine.  In considering the performance of alternative fuels such as methane and propane, the turbulent burning velocity is an important characteristic in det
ermining the combustion duration and ignition advance required for best torque.  The turbulent burning velocity in turn depends on the laminar burning velocity and turbulence levels in the engine.  The laminar burning velocity as a function of pressure an
d temperature is quite different, however, for methane, propane and octane, three fuels of great interest for the spark-ignition engine.  This paper presents the results of constant volume combustion calculations for the three fuels in order to estimate t
he relative combustion durations.  These calculations predict the pressure rise, flame speed and combustion duration of the three fuels in a closed volume

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

An Engine Simulation Model was used to study the effect of changing the maximum intake valve lift to control in-cylinder turbulence intensity and burn rate.  Experimental measurements of burn rate for two different valve lift profiles were obtained and co
mpared with predictions.  The standard K-e turbulence model was found to be inadequate for predicting the proper behaviour of turbulence level during compression and expansion.  Further investigation showed that the dissipation of turbulence calculated by
the standard K-e model was inadequate, thus causing the turbulence levels and burn rates to be approximately independent of the intake valve lift A new turbulent dissipation model is proposed which uses the eddy angular momentum to scale the dissipation
constant.  Turbulent intensity predictions from this model resulted in acceptable agreement between the measured and predicted burn rates as the intake valve lift was changed.  The effect of throttling the engine using intake valve lift was investigated a
nd predictions made of turbulence intensity, burn rate, combustion efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) as a function of air-fuel ratio and load.  Results showed a significant reduction in BSFC at 13 BMEP, 1500 RPM when conventional throt
tling was compared with intake valve throttling at equal burn rates.  In addition, the effect of B/S ratio on turbulence intensity, burn rate and ISFC was investigated and results showed the independent effects of engine geometry and turbulence on burn ra
te when the engine was stroked holding the cylinder bore constant.

NO2/NOx (v/v) fractions and NO2 exhaust emission rates were determined for diesel- and gasoline-powered passenger cars and a diesel truck, at several conditions of constant engine load and speed.  Vehicles with various kinds of emission control equipment
were investigated.  Also, integrations of NO2/NOx percentages during Federal Test Procedure driving cycles were made for six types of passenger car.  High NO2 fractions were measured for gasoline cars with air injection, and for diesel vehicles.  A passen
ger diesel with particle trap yielded suprisingly small NO2 fractions at moderate speeds.  The results have implications for NO2 concentration in the atmosphere of northern cities during wintertime inversions, in view of the increasing use of air injectio
n systems for passenger cars to meet legal restrictions on vehicle emissions of hydrocarbons and CO.  (Author abstract)

In response to a growing domestic and export demand, Bombardier has commenced research work on natural gas fuelled engine versions of their ALCO 251 and B2400 diesel engine families.  This paper reviews the earl experience of the ALCO 251 dual-fuel engine
which was mainly for pipeline and the power generation service.  The capture of this market by the manufacturers of large spark ignited engines brought an end to production of this engine variant.  Bombardier initiated work to develop a spark ignited eng
ine and to develop a state-of-the-art dual fuel version.  The evolution of these engine variants will be covered.  In addition, the "Tri-Power" engine design concept will be discussed along with the current status of the prototype spark ignited gas engine
.  Also, locomotive, marine and stationary applications will be exemplified.  (From author abstract

Natural gas fuel in a lean mixture with 25% excess air operates satisfactorily in an otherwise normal automotive engine.  All exhaust emissions known to contribute to air pollution are reduced to levels meeting or bettering currently proposed standards.
Dual-fuel operation with gasoline as a standby fuel permits immediate use of natural gas prior to the establishment of a widespread fueling network

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The aim of this work was to determine the highest possible propylene content of C3-LPG, if the fuel has to be equivalent to premium quality gasoline in a dual-fuel application.  The propylene contents (mole %) of the test fuels were 5, 20, 35 and 50%.  Kn
ock tests were made both with a CFR test engine and an ordinary four-cylinder Talbot engine.  The CFR tests showed that the level of premium gasoline quality can be reached at a propylene content of 20%, whereas the multicylinder test showed that the prop
ylene content should be about 10%.  Carbon build-up was investigated in a single-cylinder Petter W1 test engine and no differences appeared between the various gas qualities.  When propylene content varies from 0 to 50%, the theoretical air-fuel ratio var
ies from 15.8 to 15.3.  The effects of the air-fuel ratio were studied with an engine installed on a dynamometer.  The influence of the air-fuel ratio on engine performance is small at low load level and increases as does the influence of spark timing, at
higher loads.  Means of adjusting a LPG car properly were also studied.  (From author abstract

The rotary engine, invented by Dr. Felix Wankel, has been developed by the Mazda Motor Corp. over the last 25 years.  The development can be classified into three technical areas:  the gas seals and a sliding surface lubrication system necessary to reduce
friction and wear of seals and housings; combustion and emission control technologies to improve fuel economy under emission standards; and high performance technologies to intensify the inherent features of the rotary engine.  This paper discusses the a
utomotive rotary engine, and explains existing and future technologies

This paper examines factors influencing the combustion of lean mixtures of fuels and air so as to eventually improve energy utilization and reduc emissions.  Specifically some of the chemical processes that control the combustion of lean mixtures of metha
ne, representing natural gas in air, are analyzed over a wide range of temperatures (l200K to 2200K) and equivalence ratios (from 0.20 to the stoichiometric value).  Finally, som guidelines are suggested for making changes in combustion devices which will
enable them to work in a more efficient and a cleaner manner

Tests were made on the use of Saran carbon as an adsorbent for methane at pressures up to 10.34 MPa (l500 psia).  It was first necessary to produce Saran carbon in appropriately shaped pieces to fill a 1 L storage vessel with as little void volume as poss
ible.  When this was accomplished methane storage was measured and the carbon sample subjected to repeated fill-empty cycles at varying pressures and ambient temperature.  A study was then made to examine the possibility of increasing the Saran carbon ads
orption capacity for methane through activation carried out by steam and heat treatment

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper evaluates emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the use of liquefied and compressed methane in highway vehicles, considering natural gas and biomass feedstocks.  We find that the use of natural gas as a feedstock would result in slight to moderat
e reductions in emissions of greeenhouse gases, relative to a 1985 petroleum fuel base case.  With NGVs, significant reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases can be attained by greatly increasing vehicle efficiency or by using biomass feedstock (Author

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A fuel metering model was developed to analyze the impact of fuel composition on carbureted, fuel injected, and direct injected engine configurations. The change in physical properties of the fuel was found to have a profound effect on the fuel metering c
haracteristics. Fuel composition also effects the lean flammability limit of the mixture which, when combined with fuel metering variations can cause a lean burn engine to misfire. Fuel temperature variations affect fuel metering and must also be consider
ed. Results indicate that closed loop mixture control is essential for stoichiometric engines and very beneficial for lean burn engines. A closed loop feedback system based on exhaust oxygen concentration is the preferred approach.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The planning implications of New Zealand's current CNG programme and the desirability and achievability of longer term alternatives is examined here.  Consideration must be given to the future of CNG for those who have already converted their vehicles or
are thinking of converting in the near future.  Planning-related issues include the question of whether the CNG conversions implied in the 1981 Energy Plan are in the national interest, and whether it would be possible and worthwhile from  national viewpo
int, to achieve a more ambitious rate and ultimate level of CNG implementation.  To answer these questions consideration must be given to the suitability of vehicles for conversion, the availability of gas for CNG and its opportunity cost, and the value o
f CNG as a petrol substitute.  Concern also centres around the practicality of achieving either the present  government target of 150,000 CNG vehicles by the end of 1985, or of any enhanced programme which may be theoretically preferrable

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The thermoelastic response to deformation of carbonfibre/epoxy-resin composite laminates has been considered theoretically, and compared with experimental results. It is found that the surface temperature is strongly dependent on the near-surface lay-up.
The total thermal response to tensile testing to failure is also reported. The results indicate that a simple, but accurate, estimation of the yield strength in composites is possible by measure the thermoelastic limit strength, and that microstructural '
events' are detectable by measuring the surface temperature with sufficiently high resoution.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Hydrogen is excellent for use as a cold starting aid for methanol vehicles at low ambient temperatures.  Hydrogen can be produced by partial decomposition of methanol at the moment of start.  This enables the spark ignition engine to utilize only one fuel
and there is no need for fuel additives or a separate starting fuel.  An experimental investigation indicates that it is possible to start a neat methanol engine down to at least -30 degrees C using the product gas from the cold start reactor described i
n this paper.  The engine ignited on the mixture, but additional methanol was needed to establish proper idling.  The driveability was good directly after cold start by the addition of the hydrogen-rich gas.  At room temperature it was possible to both st
art the engine and reach an acceptable engine speed at idling, with the use of only the gas from the cold start reactor.  (author abstract

Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory has completed a fourth year of operation of five methanol vehicles for the Federal Methanol Fleet Project.  Five comparable gasoline vehicles were involved in the project for the first three years, but were retired at the end
of the third year.  Approximately 25,000 miles were accumulated on the five methanol vehicles during the fourth year bringing the ten car total for all four years to nearly 310,000 miles.  Fuel economy of the methanol vehicles was about the same as in pre
vious years, while drivers' ratings of ease of starting and driveability declined.  The cars required more frequent maintenance than in previous years, and the accumulation rates of wear metals in the engine oil continued to decline.  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This report examines the use of Australian natural gas (under local conditions) in vehicles, through the stages of compression, storage and vehicle use to establish the most energy efficient methods.  Vehicle fill pressure and its energy 'cost of compress
ion' is equated to vehicle range and existing NGV cylinder technology and experimental results are discussed.  Technologies and alternatives for some equipment are examined.  (from author abstract

This paper discusses the stategic and technical problems faced by manufacturers in the usage of natural gas as an automotive fuel Insufficient substitution levels, poor driving performance and unsatisfactory factors in urban runs have driven Transperth to
abandon the "Dual-Fuel" version and to choose a controlled ignition system which allows for total substitution whatever the engine load.  To cater for this demand Renault developped for Transperth a 10 litre turbocharged intercooled 6 cylinder diesel eng
ine, which has been fitted with controlled ignition and whose horsepower and performance remains unchanged.  Furthermore, increased ratios configurations have been developed, and these could be specially set if required After preliminary tests, the testin
g of buses in service has commenced

This paper is directed to individuals concerned with the impact of diesel emissions on the quality of the ambient air and the resulting effects on human health.  The study was designed to chemically characterize and bioassay heavy-duty diesel engine exhau
st as it exists in the ambient atmosphere.  Diesel emission aerosol was collected inside and outside a large NYC bus terminal in which 1400 buses operated daily.  Organics were extracted from inside and outside particulate matter and were fractionated int
o chemical classes.  Total extractable organics and each chemical class fraction for both sites were tested for mutagenicity. (Author abstract)

A 1992 GEO Metro was converted to operate on natural gas using fuel injection technology. The broad objective of the project was to develop a practical, low cost, environmentally friendly vehicle that runs on natural gas and that has an excellent driving
range. The results showed approximately the same fuel economy on natural gas (48.1 U.S. mpg) as on gasoline, resulting in a combined cycle driving range of 500 km. In addition, the vehicle showed excellent potential as a low emissions vehicle.

To aid the development of the natural gas transportation market, British Columbia Hydro designed and installed five natural gas fuelling stations for Shell Oil Canada.  This paper examines all aspects of getting the stations "up and running" in a safe and
cost effective manner including evaluating alternative station designs, compressor and storage sizing, equipment selection, capital and operating costs and installation and commissioning procedures.  This programme allowed B.C. Hydro to gain experience w
ith regard to station design, equipment supply, installation practices, and commissioning procedures.  B.C. Hydro's objective in participating in fuelling station design and installation is to promote the use of natural gas for transportation fuel.  Sales
objectives can only be met if stations prove to be safe and reliable.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Three options for on-board storage and home refueling of natural gas vehicles are presented and discussed.  Storage of natural gas at 2.2 MP (300 psig) in activated carbon-filled cylinders, and 7.0 MPa(1000 psig) and 16.7 MPa (2400 psig) in hollow cylinde
rs is considered.  Comparison information of 2.2, 7.0 and 16.7 MPa home refueling compressors is presented. Density and energy density data for natural gas and methane at pressures up to 22 MPa are also shown.  The data indicates that a 12.7 km/L (30 mpg)
vehicle requires 232, 170 and 62 litres (8.2, 6.0 and 2.2 ft(3)), respectively, of natural gas storage volume at the corresponding three pressures of 2.2, 7.0, and 16.7 MPa, to achieve a driving range of 160 km (100 miles).  Analyzing the preliminary nat
ure of the results it is suggested that natural gas storage at or above 7.0 MPa is preferred

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The wear mechanisms of polycrystalline ceramics have been studied using wear map methodology.  Wear of ceramic materials was examined under a wide range of speed and load to identify different wear regimes, and to establish the critical operating limits.
The methdology also facilitates comparison among different materials under various system parameters such as dry sliding, non reactive fluids and reactive fluids.  This study compares the wear mechanisms of alumina, silicon nitride, partially stabilized
zirconia, and silicon carbide whisker reinforced alumina.  Attention is given to the location of the transition zone from mild plastic deformation to rapid fracture controlled wear and the concomitant increase in wear rate.  The presentation is in outline
format.  (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Since 1992, the EVs are supported in Austria by lowering the VAT to 10%, abolishing motor vehicle tax and insurance tax and an additional promotion of 10,000 ATS (about 800 US$) by the government for 200 EVs.  Accompanied with these incentives a monitorin
g program was carried out.  Questionnaires including:  + the reasons for buying  + the social surroundings of the owner  + the typical usage  + the acceptance by the usersand a logbook for all journeys and charges to evaluate  + the tech
nical performance  + the every day energy demand splitted in summer - winter and times with high      range/day and low range/day and  + the costswere given to the owners.This program was finished by the end of the March, 1994.  The EVs in thi
s program were mainly used for daily shopping and commuting with nearly the same trip length distribution as conventional cars.  The results of the energy consumption was mostly higher than what the EV-sellers were predicting due to the cheap (inefficient
) battery chargers used.  Unfortunately the prsent running costs (especially battery renewing and other repair) are too high, to achieve a bigger market share.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The diesel engine is one of the most widely used prime movers in the world in both its stationary and transportation applications.  With the more stringent guidelines on exhaust emissions being enforced, and as it becomes more difficult to obtain fuels of
the right quality, increased attention is being paid to the use of alternate fuels.  This paper examines the use of dual fuel engines in some detail, including the conversion process, performance, and emissions testing.  Areas in which further research i
s required are identified

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A study was conducted by the Bureau of Mines to evaluate natural gas as an automotive fuel and to provide guidelines for optimum engine adjustments for low exhaust emissions.  The study was conducted using a single-cylinder engine, a multicylinder engine,
and a total of eight vehicles Result from the single-cylinder engine tests showed that the light-load, lean-limit misfire region for natural gas begins at an air-fuel ratio between 150 and 160 pct of stoichiometric.  Changes in ignition timing significan
tly influenced emissions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, but had little effect on carbon monoxide emission.  Low emissions can be achieved with current-design engines by adjustment of engine parameters, but only with heavy penalty to engine performan
ce.  Emissions from vehicles fueled with natural gas are virtually unaffected by ambient temperature change within the range 20 to 100 F The organic emissions from engines fueled with natural gas were estimated to be 22 to 25 pct as reactive as the emissi
ons produced using gasoline Levels of exhaust emissions from vehicles fueled with natural gas were unchanged over 10,000 miles of normal driving

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Cannery wastes are the most economical feedstock for producing fuel-grade ethanol based on the criteria of: 1) cost of collections; 2) content of fermentable substances; 3) value of other uses; 4) cost of present disposal methods; 5) perishability; 6) len
gth of season available; and 7) byproduct value.  The quantities of wet waste and dry waste available in California are estimated.  Economic analyses based on investment rate of return are developed for four alternate process schemes, varying in compexity
from a simple pretreatment, fermentation, and distillation process to a process involving pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, concentration, aerobic ethanol fermentation, aerobic cellobiose fermentation and distillation.  The hypthesized schemes use toma
to and peach cannery wastes and/or rice straw as feedstocks.  The economic sensitivity to plant size, ethanol market price, and waste treatment credit is shown.  Annual investment rates of return from 7 to l2 percent are calculated.  Quantitative studies
are recommended to determine the actual amount of waste feedstock available, and details of process conditions. (Author Abstract)

The rising costs of gasoline have resulted in public demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles.  Though this is desirable in that it aids the government's efforts to reduce fuel imports to the U.S., it is at the same time hitting the U.S. automobile ind
ustry quite hard.  The foreign car market is taking a large percentage of business away from this industry which accounts for a large percentage of the nations gross national product as well as approximately 25% of the U.S. retail sales.  Economically fue
l efficient vehicles are discussed in terms of body weight, engine performance, safety and efficiency.  It is suggested that the government should set long term goals for improving automobile economy, and methods by which this might be accomplished are in

Uni Diesel, the Paris-based subsidiary of the SACM Diesel Group has been established to promote and market the products of two manufacturing organizations: the Societe Alsacienne de Constructions Mecaniques de Mulhouse; and the Societe Surgerienne de Cons
tructions Mecaniques.  Uni Diesel has offered seven different diesel engine families from the two manufacturers and changed the well known engine names of AGO, MGO and POYAUD t UD.  Uni Diesel has decided to market four types of gas and dual-fuel engines
derived from the UD 18, UD 25, UD 30 and UD 45 diesel engine series. As rated for natural gas, these engines cover the 90 to 2100 kW power range in naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions.  Each of the manufacturing companies maintains its own engin
eering research and production facilities, yet the merger under the Uni Diesel trade name has brought about inter-connection between their various departments which will eventually contribute to making the engines more competitive on the international mar
ket

The infrastructure established by the Electrochemical Science and Technology Centre at the University of Ottawa (ESTCO) to support a research and demonstration fleet of electric vehicles (EV) includes specialized service, research, and training facilities
.  Based in the national capital, Ottawa, the program includes municipalities, utilities and government agencies throughout Canada.  The performance of the electric vans is being monitored and analyzed to determine energy and environmental impacts of EV o
peration under Canadian climatic conditions.  Research on EV power systems now in use and those still experimental is being conducted including Lead-Acid, Zinc, and Nickel systems, as well as advanced battery and fuel cell concepts.  Both fast-charge and
conventional charging are being tested.  Research on thermal management of EV batteries is being undertaken to enable the vans to operate over the wide range of temperature conditions found in Canada.  The research facilities available in Ottawa include c
old climate chambers, emission testing, and dynamometer facilities where controlled EV power train and auxiliaries (e.g. heaters) performance tests can be conducted.

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

A conversion system has been developed for a John Deere JD6466T agricultural engine enabling it to operate on a combination of natural gas and diesel fuel.  The system employs the dual-fuel principle and features microprocessor control.  It was found that
to maximize the diesel substitution., it was necessary to vary the pilot diesel quantity in response to both engine load and speed.  This allowed a diesel substitution of between 40 and 90 percent to be achieved depending on the engine condition.  The co
nversion system developed consists of three main component groups, a rack positioning device to control the diesel quantity, a natural gas control valve, and an on-board computer control unit.  A field prototype has been designed, built and installed in a
John Deere 4450 farm tractor which is undergoing field testing

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has completed its second year of operation of ten vehicles for the Federal Methanol Fleet Project; five of the vehicles are fueled with methanol.  Over 56,000 miles were accumulated on the vehicles in the second year brin
ging the total to over 152,000 miles.  Energy consumption for the methanol cars was slightly higher than that of the gasoline cars again this year, most likely as a result of shorter average trip lengths for the methanol cars.  Iron and lead have accumula
ted at greater rates in the lubricating oil of the methanol cars.  Drivers' ratings of vehicles reflected some dissatisfaction with the cold-weather performance of the methanol cars, but the cars have no special provisions for cold weather starting, and t
he fuel vapor pressure has not been tailored to the season as at other test sites.  Otherwise, drivers' opinions of the methanol cars have been favorable. (author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This paper describes a project which the author conceived and tested in the dynamometer room but which at this time has never been installed in a vessel There are several advantages in using Diesel/NG in river ferries as distinct from vehicles.  One is th
at there is a limited range of load once the vessel stops accelerating and is in a steady state condition.  Two, due to the properties of propellor demand, for any given steady state engine speed there is a similarly limited range of load combined with hi
gh engine speed.  Thirdly, the vehicle take-off load does not arise.  Lastly, a vessel can cope with the added weight of CNG cylinders more easily than a vehicle The vessels this system was developed to suit are seventy foot catamarans of light aluminium
construction for operation at speeds in excess of twenty knots in smooth waters.  The concept of using NG in conjuction with Diesel to propel river ferries is based on the principle that the variable speed governor on a diesel engine will reduce the amoun
t of diesel fuel injected if the engine speed increases due to the introduction of gas into the engine (From author abstract

This paper presents the durability study of eight catalytic converters specifically developed for natural gas engines. The converters were aged for 300 hours on a natural gas fuelled 7.0L Chevrolet engine operated at net stoichiometry. Catalyst performanc
e was evaluated using both air/fuel traverse engine tests and FTP vehicle tests. Durability cycle severity and a comparison of results for engine and vehicle tests are discussed. An analysis of the vehicle exhaust gas environment and its influence on cata
lyst performance is made.

Concerns over air quality and greenhouse gas emissions have prompted discussion as well as action on alternative fuels and energy efficiency.  Natural gas and natural gas derived fuels and additives are prime alternative fuel candidates for the transporta
tion sector.  It has been suggested that natural gas will be the next dominant world fuel.  If this prediction turns out to be true, natural gas will be the feedstock for much transport fuel.  This paper examines what the natural gas based fuel might beco
me.  This study reviews and adds to past work on energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions of natural gas fuels for transportation. Also examined are MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether from natural gas and the butane component of natural gas), alkylat
e (from natural gas butanes), gasoline from natural gas, CNG, LPG, LNG, and methanol. Vehicle efficiency potential is compared with results using nonoxygenated gasoline.  (From introduction

A Caterpillar 3406 engine with an electronic controll system to allow dual fuel operation with diesel and natural gas has been endurance tested for 250 hours on an engine dynamometer at B.C. Research.  The endurance test program was designed with assistan
ce from Caterpillar, to allow comparison with their data base on standard diesel engines.  Critical wear parts examined after the test included fuel injectors, pistons, piston rings, and cylinder liners.  Measurements on these parts showed normal wear aft
er the test. (author abstract

ines.  Fuel consumption, power output, exhaust gas composition and temperature were measured under steady-state conditions over the load and speed ranges of the engines both on gasoline and on natural gas.  With one of the conversion systems, the dependen
ce of peak power and part-load efficiency on carburetion, ignition, exhaust emissions control and engine cooling system parameters was measured and optimized.  This work indicates that, as a result of conversion to natural gas, maximum power and specific
energy consumption decline under some conditions.  Two of the conversion systems were assessed on a pickup truck with a 4.9 L engine using chassis dynamometer tests.  Fuel consumption and exhaust emissions were measured on gasoline, before and after conve
rsion, and on natural gas over the urban and highway driving cycles according to Transport Canada and US EPA guidelines.  The dynamometer results indicate that conversion is accompanied by only a modest increase in average energy consumption, a significan
t deterioration in acceleration performance, and some improvement in exhaust emission levels.  (From author abstract

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

This project was undertaken to develop a dual fuel natural gas/diesel conversion system for two-stroke diesel engines.  A prototype system was developed which uses a pair of rotary valves to time and meter the injection of natural gas into the cylinders.
Control is achieved by varying the supply pressure to the valves through a throttle mechanism which controls the flow of gas.  The diesel fuel injectors are set in the idle position to provide a pilot ignition source for the natural gas.  It is felt that
although a number of major hurdles in the development of a natural gas system for 2-stroke diesels have been overcome, additional work is necessary before the system is commercially viable

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Considering the accuracy limitations of the conventional petrol carburettor it was decided by Landi Hartog to develop a new generation of control and regulating equipment for gaseous fuels using electronic techniques.  Further development of the mechanica
l pressure regulator would create limitations in flow control accuracy, unless there was a significant increase in unit dimensions which would result in reaction time delays.  It was therefore necessary to separate the function of the pressure measuring c
arried out by the membrane and the subsequent operation of the delivery valve by the same membrane.  The method chosen to achieve this was to develop a proportional flow valve and a separate very sensitive pressure transducer and to link the two functions
electronically

The impact on electric vehicle range caused by the thermal load of the passenger compartment is examined in the context of Canadian winters.  The thermal capacity of warm batteries after charging represents a low grade heat source that could substitute fo
r the direct consumption of electric power for heating.  In addition, an effective thermal management system can increase battery life by regulating differences in battery temperature during charge and discharge cycles.  An active heat exchanger system us
ing a low cost aluminum Roll-Bond panel heat exchanger is examined to determine the feasibility of using the batteries' heat as a thermal source for a heat pump or direct source of heat for the passenger compartment.

Government interest in the use of natural gas and methanol as alternative transportation fuels has increased markedly during the past few years in the United States.  Nevertheless, U.S. government involvement is still far less than the participation by na
tional governments in a number of other countries, including New Zealand and Canada, when they embarked on major alternative fuels programs earlier this decade.  Recognition of the shortfalls the country has experienced in attaining national environmental
and energy objectives has prompted recent U.S. government's efforts in alternative fuels research, development, and commercialization This article reviews the statutory and regulatory framework guiding national programs affecting the use of natural gas a
nd methanol in the transportation sector.  It also examines pending legislation and governmen programs which promise to have a major effect on future alternative fuels use (Author introduction

This paper discusses the results from standard emissions test procedures and driving cycles for various alternative fuels.  The alternative fuels used in these experiments are CNG (compressed natural gas), LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), M85 (methanol 85%,
gasoline 15%), and E85 (fuel grade ethanol 85%, gasoline 15%).  The alternative fuels has the potential for significant reduction of automotive emissions.  Also, the photochemical reactivity of the exhaust from alternative fuel vehicles is typically much
lower than that of conventional fuel vehicle.  The results showed that, when compared to the reformulated gasoline, all of the alternative fuels showed some benefits with respect to emissions of organics, in mass emissions and in photochemical reactivity

A CNG fire involving a police car in the City of Englewood is reported. The fire occurred during refueling and could be the result of 1) vehicle operator not following procedures, or 2) fill probe, o-ring problem.  In the attempt to stop this particular p
roblem from repeating itself some changes were made to the equipment.  They changed to Hansen Quick Connect fueling componentry on the vehicle, and also placed two l/4 turn Master shut off valves on board the vehicle to allow two points of access for shut
ting off the flow of natural gas

Development work has been carried out on a turbocharged direct injection diesel engine with methanol, ethanol and gasoline.  Using additives to increase the cetane number, emulsion with diesel fuel, forced ignition with diesel injected prior to the altern
ative fuel, by a separate injection system and carburation are the methods which have been investigated.  Spark ignited diesel has been studied and is commented on to complete the picture.  The intention of the paper is to evaluate these methods

The throttleless Otto-cycle natural gas engine (TONE) control concept can potentially improve the part-load fuel economy of gas-fueled homogeneous-charge internal combustion engines by reducing the impact of throttle losses.  The experimental apparatus an
d test procedure are described; original data and preliminary test results are included.  Results with a Ford LSG423 engine show that for the inlet temperatures of 675 degrees F and above with lean fuel mixtures, the exhaust gas temperature was below the
heated inlet air temperature.  An external heat source would be required for operation in this region of the TONE map (author abstract

Recent data and interpretations of the comparative supply, performance and cost of propane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) relative to other transportation fuels support the view that propane is a practical alternative transportation fuel (ATF) option.
Data is provided on new sources of LPG engine technologies including flexible fuel, liquid injection and emission control systems; new equipment to facilitate self-service retailing and to improve propane safety.  The thesis is advanced that the long ran
ge goals for air quality and energy security established by recent U.S. legislation can best be achieved by large scale use of a triad of gaseous fuels - natural gas, propane and hydrogen.  Paper no. 911667 in "Alternative Fuels in the Nineties"  (from au

Lesser developed countries are emerging as prime targets for NGV development.  While they have a surplus of low cost natural gas they also lack sufficient capital to convert and maintain vehicles.  These countries must therefore rely on multi-lateral aid
sources such as the World Bank.  The Bank's Energy Department NGV specialists have conducted an extensive study to evaluate the economic rate of return of NGV use in 10 applications (table included(.  Factors affecting economic benefits include the cost o
natural gas, gasoline and diesel fuel, the type of vehicle converted and the investment in fuelling station and conversion equipment per vehicle.  Rates of return ranged from less than 0% to 50% and are expected to rise with oil prices

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

In 1976 the Waipa County Council began a liquid petroleum gas (LPG) conversion programme.  While a technology base for LPG in light vehicles was already available overseas, a great economic incentive caused the inclusion of heavy vehicles in the conversio
n programme.  The first conversions of large petrol engines powering twelve-tonne dump trucks encouraged confidence in the use for this application.  In 1981 four heavy truck combinations with gross laden weights in excess of thirty tonnes were converted
to dedicated LPG.  These conversions allowed close analysis of all operating costs and identified the benefits and penalties of using this fuel.  In-house dynamometer testing has complemented the field application and has contributed to a thorough underst
anding of combustion characteristics of LPG in large commercial engines.  Continuing developments have enabled the latest generation of diesel-powered trucks now entering the fleet.  Ten years of testing has confirmed full confidence in the use of this fu
el in terms of performance, reliability and safety.  (From author abstract

The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical and economic potential for use of natural gas vehicles (NGV) on prairie farms in Alberta and Saskatchewan.  Though worldwide there are several hundred thousand vehicles which run on natural gas, f
ew of these are in the agricultural sector.  Through use of statistical information available on factors such as levels and patterns of liquid fuel use, and fuel prices and availability, economic analysis are presented.  Various configurations of systems
to allow the use of NGV are discussed along with the merits and disadvantages of each.  Finally, using material developed throughout the study, there is an assessment of the potential for use of NGV on prairie farms, and identification of developments nee
ded to stimulate NGV's introduction to the Canadian agricultural community

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

B.C. Hydro tested a small hydraulic natural gas compressor for 5 months in 1986.  This prototype compressor was on loan from the Italian manufacturer SAFE through ECO Fuel System of Abbotsford, B.C.  The compressor performed satisfatorily for 974 hours du
ring the test period with occasional problems to be expected with a prototype.  The SAFE compressor appears to be a well conceived and well built unit and should provide reliable and durable performance in NGV applications.  Although the compressor itself
is expected to be relatively expensive the savings allowed by the novel fast fill capability should allow the compressor to be competitive in a fleet application.  A larger unit of similar construction may have a cost advantage in a retail service statio
n NGV application. (From author summary)

<B>Abstract: </B><BR>

Volkswagen Golfs and Jettas were modified for dual-fuel operation on compressed natural gas (CNG) and gasoline, and for dual-fuel operation on liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline.  The engines were optimized to meet United States EPA emission requirem
ents and the secondary goal was to optimize fuel consumption.  When the cars' exhaust emission control system (Catalytic convertor and air/fuel ratio control system) is left in place during gasoline operation, the exhaust emissions remain unchanged.  Howe
ver, when the emission control system is removed from the car, not only an optimization has to be found for the CNG and for the LNG carburetors, but also the gasoline injection system has to be reoptimized since it is no longer controlled by the oxygen se
nsor.  We chose to use 12.5:1 compression ratio engines for the CNG/gasoline conversions, and the series 10:1 engine for the Jetta and 11:1 compression ratio engine for the Golf operating on LPG/gasoline.  The paper contains only the abstract and diagrams

Utilization of gaseous fuel in Otto cycle and diesel engines has been included in Brazilian research into alternative non-petroleum fuels.  This automotive research included studies on the use of biogas, natural gas and industrial residue gas.  Research w
as undertaken by universities, research institutes, public service companies and industries.  It embraces both production and use of these gaseous fuels.  This paper presents the basic characteristics and results of the Brazilian experiments.  Brazil has
a significant experimental fleet which includes many vehicles that have accumulated about 100,00 kilometres.  This research work has improved the technology and the economic viability of gaseous fuels.  Because of this work, programmes for using gaseous f
uels have been developed in: captive fleets public service companies, alcohol plants and agricultural units.  (From author abstract)
