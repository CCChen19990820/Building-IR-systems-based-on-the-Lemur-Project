 AUTO TRADE SHOW

 AUTO TRADE SHOW

1.  About the show:  The Canadian International Automotive Show
(CIAS) to be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, April 14-16, 1996,
is expected to attract over 30,000 automotive aftermarket
professionals from all regions of Canada and the United States.
All segments of the automotive aftermarket industry will be
represented, including warehouse distributors, buying groups,
wholesalers, mass merchandisers, national accounts, sales agents,
national distributors, government buyers, fleet owners, car
dealers, owners of body/paint and specialty shops, as well as
garage/service station personnel.  The show will feature 900
booths, showcasing the products of more than 300 suppliers of
parts, equipment, accessories, products and services available
for sale to Canadian, as well as international aftermarket
retailers and automotive service companies. The Automotive
Industries Association of Canada (AIA) is the organizer of  CIAS,
a biennial show that alternates between Canada s two major
metropolises, Toronto and Montreal. CIAS  is Canada s largest
automotive aftermarket show.  The show will host a delegation of
300 foreign buyers from more than 40 countries in 1996.  In
addition to the USA Pavilion, CIAS will also present in Montreal
the  Future Store : the jobber store of the future featuring
three distinct areas: over-the-counter sales (retail),
professional sales,  and, warehousing, shipping and receiving
operations -- each highlighting the future of its area.

2.  About the market:  There are several favorable market
indicators that should convince U.S. firms to benefit from the
USA pavilion program and take part in Canada s largest automotive
aftermarket event.  Over the past four years, a fast-growing
Canadian demand for automotive aftermarket products in the
categories of glass and mirrors, light trucks and trailer parts,
instrumentation, garage equipment and supplies and aftermarket
accessories has been successfully satisfied by an increasing
number of U.S. suppliers.  U.S. exporters have nearly doubled
their Canadian business in these categories of products and
equipment. There is room for many more U.S.-made automotive
aftermarket products in Canada because a sustained,  strong
demand is anticipated over the next three years.  The vehicle-age
and vehicle-type composition of the Canadian fleet is now
transformed, thus creating a demand for an increasing variety of
technologically advanced, reliable and quality automotive
products and equipment.  Over the past five years, the Canadian
fleet of light trucks, including pick-up trucks, vans and sport
utility vehicles, jumped  from 3.9 million to 4.6 million, while
passenger cars slightly declined from 11.2 million to 11.0
million.  The Canadian automotive aftermarket largely depends on
imports which are valued at US$3.1 billion (point of entry), of
which nearly US$2.3 billion or 70 percent come from the United
States.  The USA Pavilion program is an ideal way to enter the
Canadian market, as well as an excellent way to increase your
sales to Canadian customers with whom you already do business.

3.  About the pavilion:  The USA Pavilion presented at CIAS  96
will offer a complete program for first-class access to the
Canadian automotive aftermarket.  Highly successful at CIAS 94 in
Toronto, the USA Pavilion will now move to CIAS 96 in Montreal,
again hosting U.S. firms ready to start on their way to
successfully penetrating the Canadian marketplace.  USA Pavilion
participants will benefit from: professionally designed and
fully-furnished  booth spaces located near the show entrance; a
promotional program which includes advanced industry-wide
publicity and on-site promotions; a direct mailing campaign
promoting participants  products and services -- targeted
exclusively to buyers, agents, dealers, wholesalers/distributors
and government agencies; a detailed exhibitor briefing featuring
experts on local market conditions and competitive practices;
personal on-site assistance provided by our fully bilingual CS
staff; and, a by-invitation-only cocktail reception to meet with
key Canadian Industry executives.

4.  The complete USA Pavilion Program is available to U.S. firms
on a first-come first-serve basis for a fee of US$2,595.
Participation is limited.  To receive registration forms and
complete details, call Pierre Richer, Commercial Service, U.S.
Department of Commerce,  Montreal: tel: 514-398-0673; fax: 514-
398-0711.

 PULP, PAPER INDUSTRY TRENDS

 PULP, PAPER INDUSTRY TRENDS

1.  Summary: After four straight years of losses, Eastern Canada-
based pulp and paper producers led Canada s forestry sector to a
brilliant recovery in 1995.  Primarily newsprint producers,
eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers have developed new
products to diversify their production over the past few years.
Spread in four of the five eastern provinces, the 116 mills in
operation  are generating combined profits that will exceed
US$1.5 billion in 1995, a return to profit levels only
experienced in the mid and late 80 s.   Eastern Canadian pulp and
paper producers are highly motivated to maintain their world
competitiveness through cost-efficiency and productivity, taking
into account the achievement of high levels of quality for their
products and compliance to environmental and international
standards.   U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paper
producers achieve their goals will find excellent export business
opportunities in the Canadian market place. The Commercial
Service (CS) in Canada offers a direct and cost-efficient
assistance service to U.S. firms ready to explore Canada's pulp
and paper industry market.  (End summary)

 2.  Prices and exports are up in 1995 and the forest industry
will have spent, by year-end, close to US$1 billion in new
products development, environmental initiatives and  advanced
technology in Canada.  The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association
estimates that Canadian forest products companies have suffered
losses of over US$4 billion between 1991 and 1994.   Now, the
forestry industry sector is back in the leading group of Canada s
goods-producing industries with a forecast of combined profits of
U$$2.3 billion for 1995.  Much of this outstanding  recovery is
linked to the successes of eastern Canadian-based pulp and paper
products producers located in the provinces of New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec.  In the first two
quarters of 1995, eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers have
reported profits nearing three quarters of a billion US dollars,
and they expect to more than double these profits to US$1.7
billion by year s end.

3.  Eastern Canada s  pulp and paper industry is favored by a
substantial forest base, deep water ports and a well-established
transportation network.  Composed of some 116 pulp and paper
mills, with more than half of those located in Quebec, eastern
Canadian mills vary quite significantly in size and increasingly
in product specialty, ranging from 100 to 1,300 tpd in capacity
and producing a variety of products from molded pulp egg trays to
lightweight coated printing papers. This mix of mill capacity and
product specialty is more noticeable in Quebec and Ontario than
in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.   However, eastern Canada is
primarily a newsprint producing region. Quebec and Ontario are,
respectively,  the first and second newsprint producing provinces
in Canada with production of 4.1 and 1.8 million tons per year.
Newfoundland s three mills are newsprint operations as well.

4.  Newsprint is not eastern Canada pulp and paper industry s
only strength.  Exports of printing and writing papers, for
example, now account for more than 14 percent of the total
industry s exports.  Over the years, an appreciable
diversification in the making of value-added products is also
worth mentioning for products like corrugating mediums, liner
board, chemic-thermomecanical pulp (CTMP) and bleached hardwood
and softwood kraft pulp, as well as lightweight coated papers.

5.  Current pulp and paper price improvements have pushed the
industry back to almost full production capacity levels. Profits
are definitely back and while the paying off of long-term debts
comes first on the agenda, pollution control and quality control
upgrades,  personnel training and machine automation and speedups
appear equally important to remain competitive and preserve the
industry s world market share.  Since the majority of eastern
Canadian mills export to the United States and other countries,
compliance with the International Standards Organization (ISO)
standards through a certification process has become necessary to
continue doing business.  These quality standards along with
environmental standards have rapidly gained  recognition within
the industry as being  instrumental to improving quality,
acquiring environmental acceptance and, as a result, maintaining
the industry s world market share.

6.  Canadian paper products have always enjoyed a reputation for
high quality which will only be maintained by producing
increasingly higher value paper grades and maintaining strict
adherence to internationally accepted standards, such as ISO
standards.  In addition, only large-scale investment in
computerized process control and other automation technologies
will help Canadian mills live up to their reputation.  Recent
Canadian statistics reveal that paper companies using at least
one type of advanced technology in their operations, such as
CAD/CAE systems, programmable controllers, manufacturing
information systems, for example, accounted for 86 percent of the
industry s shipments in 1993.  Those using at least 10
technologies already accounted for 23 percent of the shipments.
Canadian pulp and paper makers have presently achieved a
sufficient level of technological advancement to be well-
positioned in the international market place. To maintain that
advantage they are committed to constant up-grades to meet the
new challenges of the global economy.  This presents U.S.
manufacturers of goods and services for this industry with future
opportunities,  as it has with past ones in 1995.



7.  U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paper makers
improve their production cost efficiency, quality and
environmental standards and their specialized employees  skills
will find excellent export business opportunities in the Canadian
market place. The Commercial Service  in Canada offers a direct
and cost-efficient assistance service to U.S. firms ready to
explore Canada's pulp and paper industry market with its  new
opportunities.  CS s Gold Key service is delivered by trade
specialists who arrange pre-screened appointments for each Gold
Key client.  This customized business service allows visiting
U.S. company representatives to develop an understanding of the
market in eastern Canada,  as well as in the rest of the country.

 CONSUMER TRENDS

 CONSUMER TRENDS

1. Summary:  A survey conducted by the Standards Council of
Canada (SCC) with more than 2000 Canadians provides, from a
unique angle, consumer profile information expressed through
consumers attitudes and expectations regarding standards
affecting the environment, health and other services, as well as
a number of consumer products.  An amazingly high 62 percent of
completed and returned survey questionnaires indicates that
Canadians express a high degree of interest for standards. The
survey concludes that Canadian consumers are most familiar with
products' safety and performance standards but lack familiarity
with standards affecting products  quality, environmental impact,
as well as with national and international standards in such
areas.  U.S. firms which market or intend to market consumer
products and services in Canada will want to learn more from this
survey by contacting SCC or any of the accredited standards
development organizations in Canada. (End summary)

2. Environment: The SCC survey indicates there is a clear and
significant priority attached to standards for drinking water
purity, waste disposal methods and air quality in buildings. In
addition to responding to the survey's environmental
standardization questions, 40 percent of respondents volunteered
comments on the subject. Many expressed concerns for insufficient
or inadequate standards in relation to forestry, outside air
quality, and motor vehicle emissions.

3. Health: The top three health-related standard priorities for
respondents were water safety and purity, food quality and
safety, particularly standards for levels of bacteria in food.
Most senior respondents gave high priority to presentation and
content of information standards concerning prescription and non-
prescription drugs. Other priorities identified in the survey's
section entitled "over 65" were standards for personal healthcare
equipment, personal monitoring or alarm systems for people living
alone, and standards regulating  print size on package labels.

4. Services: The SCC survey's under age 60 respondents showed a
strong interest in standards for education,  while day care
standards were a priority for more females than males in the
under 40 age category of respondents.  A priority regularly cited
by all age groups combined was that of the necessity of standards
for warranties and guaranties attached to products and services.

5. Products: In the SCC survey, Canadian consumers were asked to
indicate the level of importance they attach to standards for a
list of 23 products. Heat, smoke, and fire detection systems and
burglar alarms standards attracted the greatest frequency of
response. Following closely were concerns regarding proper
standards for child-resistant containers, tamper proof closures,
products for the physically handicapped, motorized vehicles and
equipment, circuit breakers and water treatment devices.

6. SCC concludes that the survey draws a portrait of a Canadian
population for which the level of knowledge about standards is
limited, even in areas of traditional consumer interest. Even if
respectively 70 and 57 percent of respondents claim  familiarity
with safety and performance standards, survey results indicate
that respondents are minimally familiar with quality,
environmental management, national, and international standards.
For example, 71 percent acknowledge their unfamiliarity with
international standards.

7. U.S. firms which intend to market their products and services
in Canada will learn more by contacting SCC or any of the
accredited standards development organizations in Canada. U.S.
firms may also decide to familiarize themselves with the Canadian
market through the help of the Commercial Service (CS) of the
U.S. Department of Commerce which operates offices across Canada.
The Gold Key Service, for example, is one of CS's many services
which offers a cost-effective and efficient way of initiating
business contacts in Canada. This customized business service
allows U.S. firms to develop an understanding of the Canadian
consumers market by having CS trade specialists in Canada arrange
pre-screened appointments and make potentially lucrative contacts
for company representatives.  The Gold key Service is offered in
Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Halifax.

 MOBILE TELECOM SERVICE EXPANDS
 FRANCE TELECOM'S MOBILE ACCOUNTS ARE IN THE RED

1.  FRANCE TELECOM'S MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES HAVE LOST
MORE THAN FF5 BILLION (USD 1 BILLION).  THIS IS PARTICULARLY
SURPRISING SINCE MOST PRIVATE MOBILE PHONE OPERATORS IN EUROPE
HAVE BEEN PROFITABLE.

2.  IN 1994, FRANCE TELECOM MOBILES RADIO TELEPHONE AND FRANCE
TELECOM MOBILES POINTEL LOST FF870 MILLION AND FF215 MILLION,
RESPECTIVELY.  THIS IS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO 1993,
WHERE FIGURES SHOWED A TOTAL LOSS OF FF1.36 BILLION.  THE RADIO
TELEPHONE UNIT COMPRISES RADIOCOM 2000 AND ITINERIS, THE
OPERATOR'S ANALOG AND DIGITAL CELLULAR NETWORKS; POINTEL'S ONLY
BUSINESS IS THE BI-BOP TELEPOINT SYSTEM.  IN 1994, THE REVENUE IN
RADIO TELEPHONE AMOUNTED TO FF3.80 BILLION, WHILE THAT OF BI-BOP
TO FF120 MILLION.


3.  FRANCE TELECOM WAS CRITICIZED FOR NOT CREATING TWO SEPARATE
SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS MOBILE ACTIVITIES.  THE COUR DES COMPTES,
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BODY THAT MONITORS THE FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE OF STATE-OWNED COMPANIES REPORTED THAT FRANCE TELECOM
HAS NOT MET THE TWO CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR MOBILE OPERATORS BY
FRENCH REGULATORS - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY, AND
FAIR COMPETITION BETWEEN COMPETITORS.  FURTHERMORE, THE REPORT
SHOWED THAT PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBTS ARE UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE
THE SAME RATIOS USED FOR FIXED NETWORK CUSTOMERS ARE USED FOR
MOBILE, A SECTOR WITH LESS CUSTOMER FIDELITY.

4.  FOR THE TIME BEING, FRANCE TELECOM RADIO TELEPHONE UNIT HAS
NO ALTERNATIVE THAN TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE RADIOCOM 2000
BUSINESS UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY DECREASES BY ATTRITION AND CLOSES
DOWN.  WITH THE INCREASE IN COMPETITION AND A DESIRE TO SIGN UP
SUBSCRIBERS 'AT ALL COSTS', ADVERTISING EXPENSES (WHICH
REPRESENTED 11 PERCENT OF RADIO TELEPHONE'S REVENUE AND 150
PERCENT OF POINTEL'S IN 1993) WILL CONTINUE TO GROW.  THEREFORE,
FRANCE TELECOM'S FORECAST THAT THE MOBILE BUSINESS WILL BREAK
EVEN IN 1996 OR 1997 MAY BE UNREALISTIC.

5.  DESPITE THIS SITUATION, THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FRANCE
TELECOM'S MOBILE OPERATIONS ASSERTS THAT THE RADIO TELEPHONE UNIT
WILL BREAK EVEN NEXT YEAR WHILE THE BI-BOP WILL NEVER BE
PROFITABLE.  HOWEVER, FRANCE TELECOM CONTINUES TO PROMOTE BI-BOP
BECAUSE IT HOPES TO MIGRATE MANY TELEPOINT USERS TO THE MORE
EXPENSIVE CELLULAR SERVICES.

6.  FORMER FRANCE TELECOM PRESIDENT, MARCEL ROULET, BLAMED
EQUIPMENT VENDORS FOR THE OPERATOR'S FAILURE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT
MEET THE DEADLINES SET FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLATION.

7.  THE PENETRATION RATE OF RADIOTELEPHONE IN EUROPE, AS OF
AUGUST 31, 1995:  FRANCE: 1,86%, BELGIUM 1,89%, SPAIN 1,81%,
PORTUGAL 2,50%, NETHERLANDS 2,87%, GERMANY 3,97%, GREECE 2,38%,
ITALY 5,60%, SWITZERLAND 5,94%, UNITED KINGDOM 8,18%, DENMARK
11,45%, FINLAND 17,66%, SWEDEN 21,44%, NORWAY 22,19% .

 CALCUTTA PORT PROFILE
IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF CALCUTTA AND HALDIA
PORTS, WEST BENGAL

1.  SUMMARY.  OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, CARGO HANDLED
BY THE PORTS AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA (BOTH RIVER PORTS TO
THE BAY OF BENGAL) HAS INCREASED BY ALMOST 35 PERCENT.
THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES CALLING AT CALCUTTA HAS
GONE UP FROM 20 IN 1988 TO 69 AT PRESENT AND THE NUMBER
OF CONTAINERS HANDLED HAS INCREASED 120 PERCENT.  THE
COMMISSIONING OF THREE NEW CONTAINER FREIGHT STATIONS AT
CALCUTTA PORT HAS REDUCED CONGESTION AND CONTAINER
HANDLING CHARGES.  LABOR RELATIONS THAT WERE EXTREMELY
TURBULENT DURING THE 1980'S, RESULTING IN FREQUENT
STRIKES, NOW ARE COOPERATIVE.  THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHING
DETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTA IS LESS THAN A DAY, ONE
OF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.  PORT FACILITIES ARE
BEING PRIVATIZED, AND PORT AUTHORITIES ARE SEEKING
PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO AUGMENT FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
WITH INCREASING INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY IN EASTERN INDIA,
CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS ARE LIKELY TO HANDLE 30
MILLION TONS OF CARGO BY THE YEAR 2000.  END SUMMARY

2.  BACKGROUND.  CALCUTTA, INDIA'S OLDEST MAJOR PORT
(AND ONE OF TWO RIVERINE ONES), IS CURRENTLY CELEBRATING
ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY.  OVER THE YEARS THE DRAUGHT OF
THE PORT HAS DECLINED DUE TO SILTATION OF THE HOOGLY
RIVER (A BRANCH OF THE GANGES), AND LARGE SHIPS ARE
UNABLE TO REACH CALCUTTA.  HOWEVER, THE ADVENT OF
"FEEDER" VESSELS HAS BEEN A BOON, AND BOTH CONTAINERIZED
AND OTHER CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA HAS INCREASED
CONSTANTLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  TO OVERCOME THE
PROBLEMS OF LOW DRAUGHT AT CALCUTTA, IN 1977 A NEW PORT
WAS COMMISSIONED AT HALDIA, 83 KM. DOWNSTREAM FROM
CALCUTTA.  THE CALCUTTA PORT TRUST (CPT), A PARASTATAL
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, ADMINISTERS BOTH THE
CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS.

3.  CALCUTTA PORT.  CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA PORT
INCREASED FROM 4.34 MILLION TONS IN IFY (APRIL 1 THRU
MARCH 31) 1988-89 TO OVER 5.17 MILLION TONS IN IFY
1993-94.  THE HANDLING OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO HAS
INCREASED EVEN MORE RAPIDLY.  AT PRESENT AN AVERAGE 70
PERCENT OF CARGO IS CONTAINERIZED, COMPARED WITH THE
ALL-INDIA AVERAGE OF 35 PERCENT.  THE NUMBER OF
CONTAINERS HANDLED BY CALCUTTA INCREASED BY OVER 120
PERCENT, FROM 50,815 TWENTY-FOOT EQUIVALENT UNITS (TEUS)
IN IFY 1988-89 TO 112,032 IN IFY 1994-95.  CONTAINER
TRAFFIC INCREASED BY ALMOST 17 PERCENT, FROM 96,007 TEUS
IN 1993-94 TO 112,032 TEUS IN IFY 1994-95.  DURING
APRIL-SEPTEMBER 1995, CALCUTTA PORT HANDLED 60,053 TEUS,
AND PORT OFFICIALS EXPECT THAT 130,000 TEUS WILL BE
HANDLED IN 1995-96.

4.  WHILE THE NUMBER OF SHIPS CALLING AT CALCUTTA
DECLINED FROM 840 IN IFY 1988-89 TO 780 IN IFY 1992-93,
THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES OPERATING AT CALCUTTA HAS
INCREASED FROM ABOUT 20 IN 1988-89 TO 69 AT PRESENT.
THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHING DETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTA
IS LESS THAN A DAY, ONE OF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.

5.  IN SEPTEMBER, CALCUTTA PORT COMMISSIONED A NEW, RS.
250 MILLION, COMPUTERIZED CONTAINER FREIGHT STATION
(CFS), WHICH CAN HANDLE 75,000 TEUS ANNUALLY.  WITH
THIS, CONTAINER HANDLING FACILITIES HAVE EXPANDED BY
OVER 20 PERCENT AND CONTAINER HANDLING COSTS HAVE
DECLINED CONSIDERABLY.  OPERATION OF TWO ADDITIONAL
FREIGHT STATIONS (ONE PRIVATELY OWNED AND THE OTHER
OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA) HAS ALSO HELPED TO
REDUCE CONGESTION AT THE PORT.  AN OFFICIAL OF THE
AMERICAN PRESIDENT LINE TOLD US THAT OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF YEARS, EFFICIENCY AT CALCUTTA PORT HAS
IMPROVED.  HE COMPLAINED, HOWEVER, ABOUT INADEQUATE AND
POORLY MAINTAINED PORT EQUIPMENT THAT OFTEN RESULTS IN
DELAYS.

6.  LABOR.  THE WORKFORCE AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS
HAS DECLINED FROM 26,000 IN 1990 TO 21,000 AT PRESENT
(16,000 AT CALCUTTA AND 5000 AT HALDIA).  IT IS
ESTIMATED THAT THIS LABOR FORCE STILL CONTAINS SOME
11,000 UNNECESSARY WORKERS.  AS NATURAL ATTRITION
ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOSS OF 1500 WORKERS ANNUALLY, THE
SURPLUS IS COULD BE ELIMINATED BY THE YEAR 2002.
TRADITIONALLY, CALCUTTA PORT WAS BEDEVILED BY TURBULENT
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LONG STRIKES.  FOR THE PAST
SEVERAL YEARS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN CORDIAL AND
PRODUCTIVITY HAS IMPROVED.  HOWEVER, SPORADIC AGITATIONS
BY THE STAFFS OF CLEARING AGENTS, STEVEDORES,
TRANSPORTERS AND CONTRACTORS CONTINUE TO HAMPER PORT
OPERATIONS AT CALCUTTA.
7.  HALDIA.  HALDIA'S FORTE IS THE HANDLING OF CRUDE,
OIL AND LUBRICANTS (POL), PETROLEUM DISTILLATES, AND
BULK CARGO, INCLUDING FERTILIZERS AND COAL.  PRE-
BERTHING DETENTION AT HALDIA IS ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE
COUNTRY.  CARGO HANDLED BY HALDIA INCREASED FROM 9.88
MILLION TONS IN IFY 1988-89 TO 13.29 MILLION TONS
(INCLUDING 7.69 MILLION TONS OF CRUDE AND POL) IN IFY
1994-95.  ALTHOUGH CONTAINER HANDLING IS CHEAPER AT
HALDIA THAN CALCUTTA, THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS HANDLED
AT THE FORMER DURING THIS PERIOD DECREASED FROM 15,901
TO 5,745.

8.  NEW FACILITIES AT HALDIA.  A NEW BULK LIQUID
TERMINAL IS PLANNED AT HALDIA TO AUGMENT FACILITIES TO
COPE WITH THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN THE TRAFFIC OF CRUDE,
POL AND NAPTHA.  (NAPTHA WILL BE THE BASIC INPUT OF A
LARGE PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX BEING PLANNED NEARBY.)  WITH
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PIPELINE LINKING THE EXISTING
REFINERIES AT HALDIA AND BARAUNI (IN THE STATE OF
BIHAR), THE CRUDE HANDLED BY HALDIA (3.28 MILLION TONS
IN IFY 1994-95) IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ALMOST ONE
HUNDRED PERCENT IN IFY 1998-99.  TWO MULTIPURPOSE BERTHS
ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND A SECOND "ARM" AT THE DOCK HAS
BEEN EXCAVATED.  ON COMPLETION OF THE NEW FACILITIES,
HALDIA'S CARGO HANDLING CAPACITY WILL INCREASE TO AN
ESTIMATED 35 MILLION TONS PER YEAR.

10.  SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  A STUDY BY THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK HAS RECOMMENDED THAT A SHIP REPAIR YARD
WITH FACILITIES FOR UNDERWATER HULL REPAIR BE SET UP AT
HALDIA.  (HALDIA, BEING A RIVERINE PORT, HAS THE
ADVANTAGE OF BEING RELATIVELY INSULATED FROM CYCLONES.)
FOLLOWING THIS, THE CPT COMPLETED NEGOTIATIONS FOR A
PRIVATELY-OWNED SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  THE YARD
WILL HAVE TWO DRY DOCKS WITH FACILITIES CAPABLE OF
SERVICING SHIPS UP TO 80,000 DWT AND A LAY-BY WET BERTH
WITH SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE.  SEMBAWANG SHIPYARD OF
SINGAPORE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.  THE
PROJECT IS AWAITING A GREEN SIGNAL FROM THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT.

11.  PRIVATIZATION.  IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC REFORM,
CALCUTTA PORT TRUST HAS BEEN PRIVATIZING AGGRESSIVELY.
AT CALCUTTA CPT HAS LEASED OUT TWO DRY DOCKS TO A
PRIVATE, BOMBAY-BASED COMPANY AND TWO BERTHS TO TWO
OTHER PRIVATE COMPANIES.  CPT HAS HANDED OVER
MAINTENANCE OF CONTAINER HANDLING EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING
TRACTOR-TRAILERS AND RUBBER-TIRE-GANTRY CRANES, TO THEIR
MANUFACTURERS.  AT HALDIA, CPT HAS LEASED OUT TWO BERTHS
AND PLANS TO LEASE OUT MORE.

12.  CPT IS KEEN TO CONTRACT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR
CONSTRUCTION OF 15 MORE BERTHS AT HALDIA ON
BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER TERMS.  UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE
OFFERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE TAKEOVER OF EXISTING
PORT FACILITIES SUCH AS BERTHS, SHEDS, WAREHOUSES AND
EQUIPMENT, THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED INTEREST IN BUILDING
NEW PORT FACILITIES.

13.  LONG TERM PLANS.  FOR THE PERIOD 1992-97, THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOCATED RS. 1.8 BILLION
(APPROXIMATELY USD 51 MILLION) FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CALCUTTA PORT AND RS. 1.7 BILLION (USD 49 MILLION) FOR
THE DEVELOPMENT OF HALDIA PORT.  THE FUNDS WILL BE USED
TO ACQUIRE CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT, PILOT VESSELS, TUGS
AND RIVER LAUNCHES.  IN ADDITION TO THE TWO
MULTI-PURPOSE BERTHS AT HALDIA AN ADDITIONAL ONE WILL BE
CONSTRUCTED AT CALCUTTA.  AT HALDIA MODERNIZATION OF
COAL HANDLING FACILITIES AND INSTALLATION OF MECHANICAL
LOADERS, CONVEYOR BELTS AND AN EXTENSION OF THE STORAGE
AREA ARE PLANNED.

14.  COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO THE RS. 3 BILLION (USD 86
MILLION) HALDIA PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX, A REFINERY AND A
POWER PLANT ARE LIKELY TO BE BUILT AT HALDIA.  SEVERAL
PIG IRON AND STEEL PLANTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE SET UP
IN WEST BENGAL WILL REQUIRE IMPORTS OF COKING COAL AND
COKE.  THE PIG IRON AND STEEL PRODUCED BY THESE NEW
PLANTS ARE LIKELY TO BE EXPORTED TO CHINA AND SOUTHEAST
ASIA.  INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY IN EASTERN INDIA IS GAINING
MOMENTUM.  DUE TO THESE FACTORS, CALCUTTA AND HALDIA
PORTS ARE EXPECTED TO HANDLE 25 MILLION TONS OF CARGO IN
IFY 1996-97 AND 30 MILLION TONS BY THE TURN OF THE
CENTURY.

 NEW CUSTOMS LAW
 New Customs Law for Indonesia

A new customs law for Indonesia has been enacted which is
expected to take effect on April 1, 1996, after implementing
regulations are issued.

The new law provides for a self-assessment system enforced
through random inspections.  Importers and exporters will provide
the customs office with information on the type, quality,
quantity, and cutoms value of the goods being transported, and
any applicable tariffs or export taxes.  The calculations and
payment of duties will similarly be left to the companies
themselves.  Customs officials and excise officers will carry out
post-clearance audits, checking the veracity of the information
provided.

The new customs law also allows the government to impose
countervailing duties and antidumping tariffs to protect domestic
industry from unfair foreign competition.  It is not yet clear
how these elements of the new law will be applied.

The new law will replace current customs rules based on pre-
shipment rather than on-arrival inspection.

1994:
     Guard services       $460 billion
     Burglar alarms       $110 million
     Fire alarms          $125 million
     Locks                $150 million

At PROTECTION '96, the following products and services will be on
display:

     - Rescue Services
     - Environmental Protection

 RETAIL TRENDS
 Japan -- The Big Store Law leads to Structural
Change in the Retail Sector

1. In Japan, the Big Store Law (Daitenho) has changed the face of
retailing. The law has encouraged a reduction in the numbers of
high cost, privately owned, small retail stores.  In contrast,
there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of low cost,
publicly owned shopping center-type operations.  The process of
modernizing Japan's retail sector, however, is only half
finished.  Expected liberalization of the Daitenho in 1996 and
1997 will further accelerate the transition process.  End Summary

2. Statistics recently compiled by the Japan Development Bank
clearly indicate the inefficiencies of the Japanese distribution
system relative to its U.S. counterpart.

- From 1980 to 1993, the number of people engaged in wholesale
and retail trade in Japan increased only 1.43 million compared to
an increase of 5.05 million in the U.S. during the same period.

- Japan's wholesale/retail share of GDP was reduced from 14.3 to
14.1 percent compared to an increase in the U.S. from 13.5
percent to 16.6 percent, during the same period.

- Japan's wholesale/retail ratio is 2.1/1, compared to 1.1/1 in
the U.S.

- In the U.S., 60 percent of all retail stores were privately
owned in 1972.  This percentage fell to 36 percent by 1988.  In
Japan, 61 percent of total retail stores were privately owned in
1994.

3. According to 1994 MITI statistics, there are 1.59 million
retailers in Japan, of which small retailers with 1 to 4 workers
comprised 1.13 million or 71 percent of the total.  These small
stores have been disappearing at a rate of 47,000 stores per year
since a partial relaxation of the Daitenho in 1990.

4. At the same time, the number of large stores has been
increasing rapidly.  In 1989, before the implementation of the
relaxation of the Daitenho, the number of annual applications for
the establishment of large stores was 794.  In 1990, the number
of applications increased to 1,667.  In 1995, more than 1,900
applications to open large stores have thus far been submitted.

5. Since 1990, partial relaxation of the Daitenho has taken place
three times, as follows:

1990 --   Maximum length of the application processing became 18
          months.  (Implemented through an extended
          interpretation of the law.)

1992 --   Maximum length of application processing became 12
          months.  Adoption of procedural transparency
          (Implemented through partial amendment of the law.)

1994 --   Basic liberalization of stores with floor space less
          than 1,000 square meters.  Relaxation of store hours,
          number of holidays in a year, etc. (Implemented
          through an extended interpretation of the law.)

6. In the not too distant future, we expect incremental reform of
the Daitenho to continue.  Specifically, we expect that the
application process will be simplified.  Moreover, the time
required for approval will fall from the present 9 month period.
In 1997, it is likely that the government will announce further
liberalization of store operating parameters, including floor
space, business hours and number of vacation days.

7. At the same time, one should remember that there are many
forces working against the relaxation of the Big Store Law.  The
following associations have lined up in support of the present
highly restrictive legislation:
a)  Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry
b)  Federation of National Commerce and Industry
c)  Central Organization for National Small/Medium Sized Business
d)  Federation of National Shopping District Promotion
    Association, and
e)  8 other small/medium size business organizations.

Organizations that favor reform or abolition of the law are:
a)  Foreign Governments
b)  Large store corporations
c)  Japan Chain Store Association
d)  Federation of Economic Organization in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

8. Industry sources say that the restrictions of the Daitenho
have led to rapid development of a large number of suburban,
roadside stripmalls.  These stripmalls do not have any large
store tenants.  Rather, they contain a large number of small
retail outlets and therefore do not fall under the purview of the
Daitenho.  At the same time, these stripmalls do not enjoy the
same economies of scale, or low prices, as large shopping centers
with one or more large scale tenants.

9. As of now, while there are as many as 40,000 shopping centers
in the U.S., there are only 2,225 shopping centers with large
scale tenants in Japan.  An industry source estimates that the
number of Japanese shopping centers will increase by 20,000 over
the next ten years.

10. At the same time, there are 15,000 shop-lined streets in
Japan.  Almost all of the outlets along the "shopping streets"
are privately owned and managed as single store outlets.  They
are high cost operations and are the most likely to fall victim
to further liberalization of the Daitenho.  For example,
according to a recent article in "Distribution Service News," 7
of 33 three stores in Kamuma City's shop-lined street are closed.
This case is considered to be typical of many Japanese towns and
small cities.

11. The success of "Toys R Us" has is inspired similar large
scale, single category formats in other segments: electronics,
appliances, tools, men's wear and sporting goods.  The trend is
accelerating as Japanese companies anticipate further relaxation,
and ultimate abolition, of the Daitenho in the near future.

12. The structural shift in the retail industry in Japan is
taking place at a time when the "barriers to entry" for foreign
retailers are much reduced.  Land prices have dropped on the
average by 50 percent and rental is down by 40 percent.  This is
due to record levels of real estate vacancies (15 percent in
major cities).  In addition, companies that wish to build their
own properties will find that construction costs have also
declined up to 40 percent in some cases.  Most importantly, the
low value of the dollar gives companies that source abroad a
competitive advantage over Japanese competitors.  Now is a good
time for foreign retailers to re-consider entry into the Japanese
market.

 WATER QUALITY PLAN

1. SUMMARY: The results of a recent study, "Quality of Water in
Spain: Summary Report", published by the Ministry of Health and
Consumer Affairs, indicate that the quality of Spanish coastal
waters is good, whereas there are still problems with continental
waters, especially in Spain's central regions. The control
network established to measure the quality of water in Spain is
managed by Hydrographic Confederacies, which feed data to the
Ministry in Madrid through an automatic station network. This
network officially began working in March 1995 under the name
SAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacion de Calidad de las Aguas,
Water Quality Information Automatic Network). This report
provides background information on the SAICA program and a list
of the Hydrographic Confederacies and Spanish firms that supply
equipment or services to SAICA, which is considered one of the
most sophisticated water quality information systems in the
world.

2.  The network established to control and measure the quality of
water in Spain is managed by the Hydrographic Confederacies,
which are independent governmental bodies located throughout the
country with responsibilities for monitoring and managing Spain's
water resources. These Confederacies have implemented a remote
system for measuring the quality of water (automatic stations
network) under the name SAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacion
de Calidad de las Aguas). These stations can transmit monitored
data via satellite to the headquarters of each Hydrographic
Confederacy and to a central unit located in the Ministry of
Public Works, Transportation and Environment in Madrid. The data
transmitted through this network gives information on turbidity,
ph, carbon and metal content, oxygen content, phosphates and
ammonia. Each Confederacy has its own analytical laboratory, or
has special agreements with officially approved private
laboratories.

3. The SAICA system is considered one of the most sophisticated
systems of its kind in the world, and official Spanish sources
proudly say that it is the only system in the world established
on a country-wide basis. It covers all of the main river basins
in Spain and uses state-of-the-art technology. Total investment
in the SAICA system was Pts 10,000 million (USD 80 million) which
includes installation of 1,000 manual water quality control
stations and 200 automatic control stations. Investment was
partially funded through European Union Cohesion Funds (85% of
total investment).

For further information on the Spanish water quality control

 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS
 New Internet Provider in Indonesia

On November 30, 1995 a new Internet provider was launched. It is
the fifth Internet provider in Indonesia to date.
The provider is called CBNnet, established by P.T. Cyberindo
Aditama in cooperation with YPTI, Foundation of Technical
Education in Indonesia, a foundation under the Department of
Tourism, Post and Telecommunication.
Mr. Dani Sumarsono, president of P.T. Cyberindo Aditama,
informed U.S. Commercial Service Jakarta that Internet business
in Indonesia will grow steadily and competition will be based on
services, tariff rates, reliability and accessibility. Tariff
levels have been set by the government, so that each Internet
provider only has a narrow band within which to compete in price.
CBNnet has a maximum modem speed of 28.8 Kbps for individual
accounts (IP dial up) and 33.6 Kbps for corporate accounts (LAN
dial up). At this stage, its target market is the professionals
in the Jakarta area. With improving infrastructures, CBNnet is
optimist it could get at least 2,000 individual accounts in the
first year of operation. Mr. Sumarsono revealed that there has
already been a big jump in the number of Internet users in
Jakarta. In June this year, there were 8,000 users, but by
September there were 15,000 users. He expects it will take
several more years for the industry to become fully mature.
There are currently four other Internet providers : IndoInternet
(P.T. IndoInternet), Idola (P.T. Aplikanusa Lintasartha), Radnet
(P.T. Rahajasa Media Internet) and IBM Internet Connection (P.T.
Sistelindo Mitralintas).

         CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NEWS

         CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NEWS

1. Summary: Eastern Germany's large chemicals industry, which
accounted for 20 percent of total industrial output for the
nation before reunification, continues to confront the problems
of restructuring its large inefficient chemical concerns,
adapting to new markets, finding buyers, and cleaning up massive
pollution.

2. Background:  in the former GDR (Eastern Germany), 230 chemical
companies, encompassing petrochemicals, plastics, rubber, and
potash mining, were grouped into 14 huge conglomerates.  By 1994
over 200 of these companies had been privatized.  However, the
size of these privatized companies averaged under 300 employees.
The remaining chemicals firms had the overwhelming share of the
total employees in the industry.  The large companies also
suffered from antiquated equipment and continue to operate in the
midst of massive environmental damage. The most publicized
privatization case covered the three chemical production sites in
eastern Germany which Dow Chemical (Midland, Michigan) agreed to
buy in November.  This is the Buna Sow Leuna (BSL) conglomerate.

3. Interim Market Dynamics:  the output trend for inorganic and
organic chemicals clearly reflects changes in the eastern German
chemicals market.  The primary change is aimed at reducing
lignite processing and building up a petrochemicals base.  Since
the middle of 1990 over 150 antiquated production facilities in
the chemical industry have been shut down in eastern Germany.  In
Leuna, plants for ammonia, methanol high-pressure, and phenol
synthesis were shut down, and in the Buna facility, carbide-
acetylene production.  Until production of basic chemicals can be
restarted on a petrochemical basis, organic chemicals for further
processing are purchased from elsewhere.

4. Environmental Consequences: environmental cleanup is a high
priority for the Germans, accounting for one-third of total
investments in the eastern German chemicals industry.  The
Treuhand (federal privatization agency) originally provided Buna
with DM 300 million for the construction of an oxychlorinating
plant for pvc production and for an air separation plant.  For
Leuna the Treuhand provided DM 250 million for a hydrogen
production plant, a refinery water cleaning plant, a
desulphurization plant, and a tanker filling station.  For many
chemical companies, funds are being provided for disposing of
polluted waste dumps.

5. Dow Chemical: In November, 1995 the European Commission
reached a final decision to approve the privatization of the Buna
Sow Leuna (BSL) Olefin chemicals conglomerate in the eastern
German state of Saxony-Anhalt. To that end the EC Commission has
decided to allow up to 5.5 billion dollars of investment
subsidies to support the privatisation plan laid out by Dow
Chemical. Dow will own 80 percent of the BSL conglomerate with
the remaining 20 percent owned by BVS (the successor agency to
the Treuhand).  So far, ten companies have signed letters of
intent to join Dow at BSL, including the American plastics
molder, Ampacet Corp., Spanish-owned Grupo Coexpan, the Belgian
Ravago, Italy's ILPA, Manuli Group and Deribok.

6. Modernisation: Dow has plans to upgrade a number of existing
facilities.  The existing chlorine plant will be upgraded from
the current mercury-based process to a membrane process,
eliminating the use of mercury in these plants.  The ethylene
dichloride (EDC)  and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plant at Buna
will be upgraded along with an increase of VCM capacity to
330,000 tons per year.  The existing rubber production facilities
will be retrofitted and upgraded.  The low-density polyethylene
plants at the Leuna site will be upgraded to increase plant
safety.  And a general upgrade of the process instrumentation and
control systems is planned.  The Boehlen steam cracker which
produces the main building blocks for derivative plants at all
three sites will be upgraded and expanded to make the cracker
globally cost-competitive in technology and feedstock
flexibility.  Total capacity by the end of 1997 will be 450,000
tons per year.  The upgrade will include plant modifications such
as four new cracking furnaces, on-stream analyzers and
computerized process control.

7. New Equipment: new facilities are also planned.  A 210,000
ton-per-year plant for the production of DOWLEX(r) linear low-
density polyethylene at the Buna site will come on stream in late
1997, in coordination with the expanded production of the steam
cracker at Boehlen.  A 200,000 ton-per-year polypropylene plant
will be built at the Buna site and will come on stream during the
second quarter of 1998.  A 130,000 ton-per-year aniline plant
will come on stream in late 1998.  A 90,000 ton-per-year acrylic
acid and a 93,000 ton-per-year acrylic ester unit will be built
to obtain viable economics through scale and technology.  Several
facilities for the compounding and recycling of polymers will be
added to the Buna site.

8. Feedstock Pipeline: a new pipeline is also planned.  A 16-inch
multi-feedstock liquid pipeline from the deep-sea port of Rostock
to the Boehlen site has already been started by the Saechsische
Olefinwerke GmbH.  Planning and construction of this pipeline
will include the construction of required facilities such as
harbor facilities, terminals and pump stations.

9. Chemicals Industry Supplier Mission:  FCS Berlin is planning
for the Spring of 1996 a trade mission to eastern Germany, which
will include a stop at the Buna Sow Leuna facilities.  Those U.S.
firms that can benefit from new contacts in the chemicals
industry in eastern Germany are encouraged to participate.  The
mission will be coordinated with German authorities to insure
that the best contacts are made for the U.S. participants.  For
follow-up information and costs on the trade mission, contact:

OF THE DEMAND UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO.  THE DEMAND WAS FOR
LOW QUALITY LOW PRICED BICYCLES.  LOCAL PRODUCTION
ADAPTED ITSELF TO THIS MARKET TREND FOR A LONG TIME.  THE
TREND HAS CHANGED ONLY RECENTLY WHEN IMPORTERS CAME INTO
THE PICTURE.  IMPORTS OF DIVERSE RANGE AND QUALITY OF
BICYCLES WHICH STARTED TO DRIVE THE MARKET, PROMPTED THE
LOCAL MANUFACTURERS TO FOLLOW SUIT.  SOME OF THEM SIGNED
LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH LEADING BRANDS, WHILE OTHERS
DIRECTED THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY.  IN 1995,
LOCAL PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REACH 900,000 UNITS AND
$175 MILLION.  LOCAL BISAN TAKES 50% SHARE FROM THE
MARKET. MARKET SHARE FOR OTHER COMPETITORS ARE BELDESAN
(25%), BIANCHI(25%), AND OZBELGE(10%).  BICYCLE PRICES
VARY BETWEEN $250-400 FOR STANDARD BICYCLES, WHERE THEY
CAN BE AS HIGH AS $2,500 FOR SPECIAL ONES.

3.  IMPORTS: BICYCLE IMPORTS DECREASED TO 58,487 UNITS
($2.8 MILLION) IN 1994 FROM 1993'S FIGURE OF 100,258
($5.2 MILLION) DUE TO A MAJOR ECONOMIC CRISIS IN TURKEY.
TAIWAN AND PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) TAKE THE
LION'S SHARE OF THE IMPORT MARKET.  BREAKDOWN OF IMPORTS
ACCORDING TO COUNTRIES IS AS FOLLOWS:

               1993                     1994
COUNTRY   QUANTITY  VALUE          QUANTITY  VALUE

TAIWAN    70,880    3,744,078      38,718    2,014,312
PRC       15,151      986,070      14,169      355,936
ITALY      1,514      141,182       4,865      353,061
U.S.          20        8,050         172       32,313
TOTAL    100,258    5,249,994      58,487    2,785,329

DESPITE THE DECREASE IN THE OVERALL BICYCLE IMPORTS IN
1994, IT IS OBSERVED THAT IMPORT FIGURES HAVE GROWN FOR
ITALY AND U.S.  ALTHOUGH RESPECTIVE QUANTITIES ARE QUITE
LOWER THAN THE FIRST TWO COUNTRIES, IMPORT VALUE PER
BICYCLE IS MUCH HIGHER.  THESE FIGURES IMPLY THAT THE
U.S. EXPORTERS SHOULD AIM FOR THE HIGH-END OF THE MARKET
DRIVEN BY HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND QUALITY.  MOUNTAIN BIKES,
FOR EXAMPLE, CONSTITUTE A GOOD MARKET FOR U.S. SUPPLIERS.

IMPORT TAX IS 3.8% FOR EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND 17%
FOR OTHERS.  IT WILL BE ZEROED FOR EU COUNTRIES WITH THE
CUSTOMS UNION WHICH WILL START IN 1996.  SOME DECREASE IS
EXPECTED FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL.

4.  EXPORTS: BICYCLE EXPORTS FROM TURKEY OVER THE LAST
TWO YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS:

1993: 36,497 UNITS ($2.4 MILLION)

1994: 82,628 UNITS ($4.8 MILLION)

MAJOR EXPORT MARKETS IN 1994 WERE: ITALY: 19,405,
GERMANY: 17,056, CZECH REPUBLIC: 11,990, POLAND: 7,676,
GREECE: 6,525.

Business:   CIBC is a broadly based Canadian financial services  company
operating  on  a global basis.  In terms of assets, it is one  of  North
America's   largest   financial  institutions.   CIBC's   Personal   and
Commercial Bank provides a full range of financial services to 6,000,000
individuals,  farmers  and  businesses across Canada.   It  also  serves
retail  customers through one of the largest financial networks  in  the
West Indies and through private banking centers around the world.   CIBC
Wood  Gundy  offers  a  wide spectrum  of  credit  and  capital  markets
capabilities  to  several thousand corporate clients  and  institutional
investors  worldwide.   In  addition,  it  provides  a  wide  range   of
investment  services to individuals.  Employees throughout the group  of
companies  are  dedicated to building long-term relationships  with  all
CIBC  customers.   CIBC helps individuals and businesses  achieve  their
visions by anticipating and meeting their changing needs, and delivering
integrated  solutions.  This is how CIBC ultimately enhances  value  for
its shareholders.

News:   CIBC  became  stronger  in almost every  respect  in  1994.   It
generated  higher revenue growth and record earnings, and  significantly
improved  the  quality of its balance sheet.  CIBC  also  developed  and
refined its business strategies to ensure long-term growth and drive  it
toward its goal of becoming the pre-eminent Canadian financial  services
company.

Revenues  grew across the organization, reflecting gains in  traditional
product  lines as well as efforts to diversify sources of  income.   Net
income increased to $890 million, up from $730 million last year.   CIBC
achieved  record  net income of $255 million for the 1st  quarter  ended
January 31, 1995, an increase of $41 million or 19% from the same period
a  year ago and $19 million or 8% from the previous  quarter.   Earnings
per  share  increased to $3.52 from $2.99 last year.  Return  on  equity
climbed  to  11.7%  compared with 10.6% in fiscal 1993.   At  year  end,
CIBC's balance sheet and capital ratios were the strongest they've  been
in  many  years.   It  strengthened  the  balance  sheet  by  increasing
liquidity and improving the quality of the lending portfolio.  The level
of net non-performing loans decreased to $1.5 billion from $2.4  billion
the   previous   year.   In  the  last  year,   CIBC   accelerated   its
transformation into a broadly-based financial services company.

It  strengthened  the  core  franchise  and  moved  ahead  with  planned
expansions into new businesses and markets.  With the acquisition of The
Personal  Insurance Company of Canada, CIBC gained critical mass in  the
group  insurance  market.   And  the  merger  of  the  CIBC   Investment
Management  Corporation subsidiary with T.A.L. Investment  Counsel  Ltd.
provides  CIBC  with  a majority stake in what is now  one  of  Canada's
largest  institutional  investment managers.  Over the year,  CIBC  also
expanded its trust operations to 26 offices across Canada,  consolidated
a  leading  position in the Canadian credit card market,  added  to  the
volume  of  residential  mortgages and  consumer  loans,  and  increased
lending to small and medium-sized businesses.

OKI ELECTRIC INDUSTRY CO. LTD.
Mr. Minoru Tsukahara
7-12 Toronomon 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105
Japan
tel.: (81) 3 3501 3111; fax: (81) 3 3581 5522.

Exchange(s):  Tokyo; Osaka.

Business:    Oki   Electric  Industry  Company  Limited  is   a   global
manufacturer  and marketer of leading-edge  telecommunications  systems,
information processing systems and electronic devices.

Spanning  more  than 11 decades, Oki Electric has imbued  a  progressive
spirit  of  enterprise into market-winning products and  services.   The
Company's  integrating  concept is People to  People  Technology,  which
embraces  multimedia, human interface systems and electronic devices  to
enhance communications worldwide.

Oki Electric is a responsible corporate citizen that contributes to  the
well-being of its host communities around the world.

The  Company  was founded in January 1881 and  established  in  November
1949.

News:   August  1995  Message from the  President  and  Chief  Executive
Officer, Mr. Jun Jinguji:

"Oki  Electric  attained consolidated net sales of yen657.0  billion  in
fiscal  1994, ended March 31, 1995.  Up 0.8% from a year  earlier,  this
result reflected increased demand for telecommunications  infrastructure
and  for semiconductors used in personal computers (PCs).   However,  we
improved our bottom line dramatically, recording a net income of yen32.3
billion,  or  yen52.70  per share, compared with a net  loss  of  yen1.8
billion, or yen2.85 per share, the previous period.  In fiscal 1995,  we
expect once again to achieve net sales on the order of yen650.0  billion
despite the strong yen and moderate outlook for economic growth.

"We  have  rebounded  from  our  fiscal  1992  low  by  implementing   a
restructuring plan from April 1993 that reorganized production,  sharply
reduced fixed costs and converted the operations for select  high-volume
products into separate entities.  Our printer and facsimile  operations,
for  example,  were established as an independent subsidiary,  Oki  Data
Corp.,  on October 1, 1994.  Our firm results for this year are  largely
attributable to the success of these restructuring measures.  To sustain
momentum and stabilize profitability, we are starting a second phase  of
the plan in fiscal 1995, aimed at further refining operating efficiency,
consolidating resources and focusing on select businesses.  We intend to
mobilize  Oki Electric's progressive spirit and corporate  strengths  to
realize the virtually unlimited opportunities of the emerging multimedia
era.

"Multimedia  systems  offer  robust  growth  potential  and  utilize Oki
Electric's  strengths,  making  them  a prime  focus  for  the  Company.
Advancing  in  this direction, we became an equity  partner  in  General
Magic,  Inc., a leading communications alliance, in December  1994.   We
are  using  its platform technologies to develop  innovative  multimedia
communications terminal systems.  We also launched sales of asynchronous
transfer mode switching systems and related products.  By  participating
in  numerous  service  trials,  we are  striving  to  commercialize  new
applications that will help determine the future shape of the multimedia
society.

"In recent years, demand for large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs)  has
grown with the expansion of the markets for PCs, peripherals and  mobile
communications equipment.  To respond to this demand, we completed Phase
1  construction  of  manufacturing facilities for  LSIs  at  Miyagi  Oki
Electric Co., in fiscal 1994 and scheduled production to commence in the
first quarter of 1996.

"The approaching 21st century is often described as the Age of Asia.  In
recognition  of the region's potential, we plan to expand  our  regional
production  and  marketing presence.  We have started  this  process  by
reinforcing our marketing and service network throughout Asia.

"Oki Electric has undergone a successful revitalization in the past  two
fiscal  years.   Our  task over fiscal 1995  is  to  further  streamline
operations, focus on key business segments and develop new  capabilities
to create a secure foundation for growth well into the 21st Century."

           liabilities 101,001,800      (group: 104,031,500)

News:  Postipankki has 5,761 employees; was established in 1886  and  is
the  third  largest  commercial bank in Finland.   In  addition  to  its
extensive domestic network and advanced payment systems, the Bank has an
international  network with branches in London, New York  and  Singapore
and  representative offices in Stockholm, Moscow and Tokyo.  Moreover  a
worldwide   network  of  correspondent  banks  in  the  most   important
industrial  and  business  centers ensures the speedy  handling  of  the
bank's  international business.  After suffering a prolonged  recession,
the Finnish economy took a turn for the better in 1993.  Though domestic
demand  continued to decline, exports embarked on an energetic  upswing.
The value of the markka weakened early in the year, but the unexpectedly
fast  decrease  in the current account deficit, mainly  due  to  Finnish
companies'  success  on  export markets,  gradually  began  to  generate
expectations  of  a revaluation.  The Postipankki Group  performed  much
better in 1993 than in 1992, but still showed a loss.  The  consolidated
operating  loss was FIM 354 million, i.e., FIM 287 million less than  in
1992.    Postipankki   Ltd's  operating  loss  was  FIM   372   million.
Consolidated net income from financial operations rose 12% to FIM  3,032
million,  against a mere 2% rise in 1992.  Net interest income stood  at
FIM 2,567 million, up 17% compared with the previous year's 4%.

           liabilities  175,345,000     liabilities   175,491,000

News:    Net  income  nearly tripled between 1993  and  1994  to  $1,169
million.   A significant factor behind the improved 1994 earnings was  a
$930  million, or more than 50%, reduction in the provision  for  credit
losses  and a 36% reduction in net non-accrual loans from  1993  levels.
Cost  control  initiatives  included  the  reduction  of  complement  by
approximately  3,500  employees and the closure of  130  branches.   The
integration  of  Royal  Trust which was acquired  in  1993  was  largely
completed on schedule and on budget.  Assets under administration in the
bank's  mutual fund business grew 25% from 1993, making Royal  Bank  the
second  largest  provider of retail mutual funds in  Canada.   The  bank
helped   create   a   new   world  class   venture   fund   to   support
commercialization  of  drug  products and devices  to  treat  brain  and
central  nervous system disorders.  As well, $125 million was  committed
to a risk capital fund created to finance the growth of small and medium
size  businesses.   Plans were announced for a telephone  banking  Super
Centre  that will provide customers with faster, more  flexible  service
from  anywhere in the country, 24 hours a day.  During 1994, the  bank's
brokerage  subsidiary, RBC Dominion Securities, recorded net  income  of
$133 million.  Effective November 1, 1994, John Cleghorn was named Chief
Executive  Officer  of Royal Bank, succeeding Mr. Allan  R.  Taylor  who
remains Chairman of the Board until the bank's annual meeting on January
26, 1995.

NEWS: GRANADA SET FOR FINAL TILT AT FORTE

Granada enters the closing stages of its campaign to buy Forte this
week with a harder job on its hands than many observers thought
probable when the hostile bid was launched.

In the face of Forte's skillfully marshalled defence, Granada must
decide by Tuesday whether to increase its cash offer of 321p per Forte
share - the City thinks at least 380p is needed - or to stick to its
guns. That means trying to convince investors that its brand of
management is what underperforming Forte needs. Unless the television-
to-motorway services group comes up with something eye-catching, what
started out with a bang risks ending with a whimper.

Forte surprised many this week by the robustness of its final offer,
according to stockbrokers' analysts. There is now a growing band which
reckons Granada must both increase its price and improve the quality
and detail of its argument.

It is not just the fact that Forte has found enough cash, thanks to the
proposed sale of its roadside cafes to Whitbread for pounds 1.05bn, to
launch a share buy-back worth pounds 800m (including the associated tax
credit). The pledge to distribute its stake in Savoy Hotels, worth 23p
a share, also increases shareholder value. After years of static
dividends, this week's promise to raise the payout 20 per cent a year
until the end of the decade was unexpected.

Forte claimed that to match the income provided under its latest
defence plan, Granada would have to raise its own dividend by 43 per
cent a year over the period. The bidder responded with its own estimate
of how easily Forte could live up to its promises. 'To cover the
dividend pledge Forte will have to double its profits over the next
three years,' said Granada finance director Henry Staunton. 'Given its
past record and the volatile nature of the business this is risky.'

Mr Staunton, questioning Forte's debt levels and highlighting the poor
returns it had made on its upmarket hotels, this week sounded
increasingly like a man preparing to tough it out, fighting on
Granada's skills and solid past record. This may be because increasing
the bid could push the bidder's debts to levels it would be
uncomfortable with. A cash bid of 380p would call for another pounds
500m, with pro-forma gearing already more than 200 per cent. Mr
Staunton and his chief executive Gerry Robinson may nevertheless regard
such debt levels as sustainable, with the cash-generating power of
Granada's ITV franchises (Granada and London Weekend) and interest
payments still covered roughly three times, as they would be at Forte.

This week Forte and its advisers stole their adversaries' rhetoric.
Whereas Granada's opening shot dwelt on the gulf in management
expertise and strategic focus between the companies, it's now Forte
which boasts that after its programme of disposals it will be the more
focused, growth-orientated company. Granada still has the option of
pledging to implement much of what Forte's management has agreed to do.
If it couples this approach with a higher offer, the argument as to
which of the two managements deserves support would be back on.

NEWS: MONEYBROKING - CITY CLUB LOSES ELITE STATUS

The New Year heralded a challenging new era for the hitherto exclusive
club of gilt market moneybrokers. Companies affected include Cater Allen -
owner of Sheppards, the largest moneybroking firm - Gerrard & National,
King & Shaxson and Union.

To help nourish the new market in gilt repos - agreements to sell and
repurchase gilts at a fixed price and on a fixed date - the Bank of
England has liberalised Stock Exchange moneybroking across the board,
with effect from 2 January, when repo trading got off to the gentlest
of starts. The Bank is keen for repos to thrive, as the ability to
issue them at will would help it fine-tune interest rate movements. In
the US, by comparison, the Federal Reserve intervenes daily in Treasury
bond repo markets.

Up to now, just eight firms have possessed a Stock Exchange
moneybroking license, allowing them to arrange for shares or gilts to
be borrowed or loaned on a short-term basis, principally by market-
makers wanting to balance their books at the end of each day's trading.
Now, any Stock Exchange member can act as a broker, and anyone can lend
or borrow. Merrill Lynch analyst Martin Green believes that, over time,
huge growth in the repo market should compensate the established
moneybrokers for a gradual loss of market share and erosion of profit
margins.

Among the quoted companies which must cope with the loss of their
'closed-shop' privileges, Cater Allen makes the most significant
proportion of its earnings from this market. In the year to last April,
43 per cent of the pounds 23.9m group profit before tax and exceptional
items came from Sheppards. Merrill Lynch forecasts pounds 20.8m this
year and a dividend of 30p, giving a PE ratio of 9 and a yield of 8.8
per cent; last year's 29p total dividend was almost twice covered.
Sheppards could be a business with appeal to an overseas buyer wanting
to move early and quickly into London's repo and related markets. Next
most exposed is Gerrard & National. It made 15 per cent of pre-
exceptional profits last year from its moneybroking franchise.

NEWS: LOOKING FOR CLUES ON THE TAKEOVER TRAIL

Industry leaders may moan about short-termism in the City, but the
plain fact is that investors love takeovers. And it's no wonder when
you look at what a determined bidder can do for the price of shares in
the target company. Last year, as ever, some of the happiest investors
were those who held shares in companies on the receiving end of
takeover bids.

Internet access provider Unipalm saw its shares rise more than four-
fold before US counterpart UUNet gained control. And shareholders in
more widely held stocks, such as Eastern Group (bought by Hanson) and
VSEL (GEC), saw bids lead to bumper profits.

Anyone who gets in ahead of the takeover action in 1996 will seriously
increase their chances of a prosperous new year. Here, then, are
Investors Chronicle's five companies most likely to attract a bid in
the coming months.

Kwik Save (500p) Dismal recent trading and a share price which has
lagged the market by almost a quarter over the past year make this a
prime takeover candidate. The group is being squeezed both by food
giants such as Sainsbury and Tesco and by foreign-owned discounters
like Netto and Aldi. Lead shareholder Dairy Farm (part of Hong Kong's
Jardine Matheson) is no longer bound by an agreement not to raise its
30 per cent stake. Even if it has tired of its poorly performing
investment, a suitor could pick up Kwik-Save at anything between 700p
and 800p.

Vosper Thornycroft (824p) The Southampton-based warship builder could
provide a tasty morsel for high- flying British Aerospace. BAe was
thwarted in its attempt to buy VSEL, and could be looking for another
catch to take it further into naval contracting. Vosper provides the
only challenge in this arena since VSEL and Yarrow are both part of
GEC. Although BAe is no longer desperate for cash, Vosper had a healthy
pounds 109m surplus at the last count. The shipbuilder also has a
healthy order book and is winning work away from shipbuilding too.

British Gas (256p) The shares plumbed new lows in 1995 as the market
digested the implications of its fixed-price take-or-pay contract
liabilities and fears over the new pricing regime for TransCo, the gas
transportation arm. Rumours of a predator surfaced late last year. At
pounds 11bn British Gas would be a mouthful for anyone. But TransCo
could be worth pounds 18bn, there is a valuable exploration division
and the company remains in a very strong position in the UK gas market.
Management would also have a hard job to defend its recent performance.

Crest Packaging (64p) It is increasingly difficult for smaller
packaging companies to compete. Without sufficient buying power and
economies of scale they need to grow significantly or be swallowed up.
Parkside and Ferry Pickering have already gone, and little Crest could
be next. It makes flexible packaging and cartons for consumer markets
and discussed a merger with Parkside last year. It has found it
difficult to pass on input price increases, and trading conditions
'remain tough'. Managing director Rodney Webb owns two-thirds of the
shares, so a buyer would need his consent.

Allied Domecq (537p) Vultures have reportedly been circling over Allied
for some time. Major restructuring and a number of changes in direction
have not produced significantly better performance either for the
business or the shares. Unless that changes soon, a buyer which fancies
its chances of running Allied's portfolio of spirit brands, pubs and
brewing activities could be hard to resist. Sir Christopher Hogg takes
over as chairman in April. He has to put some zip into Allied quickly
or it may be a short term of office.

NEWS: AMSTRAD - RESIGNATION HITS SHARES

Amstrad shares crashed almost 13 per cent in the quiet trading period
between Christmas and New Year as the consumer and business electronics
group belatedly revealed that its chief executive had quit. David
Rogers had served just 16 months of his three-year contract, which paid
him a salary of pounds 225,000.

The departure fuelled fears that Amstrad founder and chairman Alan
Sugar was once more taking hands-on control. Analysts also believe Mr
Sugar's thwarted plan of three years ago to take the company private
may be revived.

The City has never been convinced of Mr Sugar's commitment to serving
the interests of all Amstrad shareholders. 'No doubt he would be
happier if he was running Amstrad and owned it himself,' an analyst
commented. Mr Sugar's buy-back offer was worth the equivalent of 150p a
share. Now at 192p, the shares are worth 28 per cent more than Mr Sugar
offered - about the rate of growth achieved by the London market as a
whole. Mr Sugar's attempt to take Amstrad private ran aground because
shareholders felt their chairman was trying to get the company on the
cheap.

Mr Rogers was Amstrad's first chief executive. His decision to go
follows a crisis board meeting last month at which directors decided to
scale down Ace, the its ailing consumer electronics business, in order
'to reduce its cost base in line with its sales potential'. Ace brings
in about a fifth of Amstrad's turnover but has incurred losses for the
past three years. However since Mr Rogers joined Amstrad, Ace had been
brought to within a whisker of breaking even. Whether it could do
better than that is debatable given the intense competition in the
audio, video and satellite TV markets.

Almost a year ago, Mr Rogers told Investors Chronicle he would quit
Amstrad if he didn't get his way in the restructuring of the company -
but made it clear that he couldn't foresee such a situation arising.
'Alan Sugar is no different from any other entrepreneur,' said Mr
Rogers. 'All need great business acumen to get where they have. But
when it comes to running a business on a day-to-day basis all
entrepreneurs need help.'

NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BLOW TO BID HOPES

Takeover bids for water companies could be stopped in their tracks if
regulator Ian Byatt succeeds in preventing full mergers between buyers
and their water subsidiaries. Mr Byatt is conducting a campaign to
ensure that future buyers of companies under his supervision retain a
separate stock market listing for the water business. The prospect
could put would-be predators off, analysts said this week.

A separate listing would involve making at least 25 per cent of water
shares available for trading. The water arm would have to maintain an
independent board, diluting the control of the acquiring company over
matters such as dividends paid.

Corporate activity in the water industry has been relatively meagre in
comparison to the frenzied electricity sector, with just Northumbrian
Water losing its independence (to French utility Lyonnaise des Eaux).
While this combined group has informally agreed to retain a separate
quotation for the UK water utility, North West Water and Welsh Water,
which are taking over electricity companies, have so far resisted
pressure to follow suit.

Mr Byatt maintains that separate share price information is needed to
provide the regulator with an adequate basis for performance
comparisons. Some analysts find Ofwat's stance baffling, however. 'To
try and change the rules halfway through the game is ludicrous and
raises questions about Ian Byatt's credibility,' said one of them.

Companies which buy water distributors but resist separate listings
could face changes in their licence, said Ofwat. Failure to agree would
mean a referral to the monopolies commission - a prospect which is
often enough to derail takeover bids.

NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BURST PIPES BRING MORE BUSINESS

Ofwat this week called on water companies to explain why the loss of
water supplies to some weather-affected parts of the UK had lasted so
long. So far, though, the cost to water companies of the spate of burst
pipes looks likely to be slight. And the problem is even bringing extra
business to the hard-pressed building supplies sector. 'It's a nice
short-term boost but the overall impact is marginal,' said Steve
Webster, finance director of plumbing parts distributor Wolseley. 'The
rest of the market remains depressed.'

NEWS: SCHRODERS - MANAGER QUITS

Shares in the pounds 104m Schroder Japan Growth investment trust fell
by almost 5 per cent this week as fund manager Ed Merner announced his
resignation from Schroders for 'personal reasons'. A Schroders
spokeswoman denied there would be much effect on its funds, but Charles
Cade, an investment trust analyst at Merrill Lynch, warned: 'Ed Merner
is a big name and that supported the rating of the trust.' Mr Merner
also managed Schroders' pounds 229m Japanese Smaller Companies unit
trust.

The Japan Growth trust has performed well since its launch in July
1994. In the year to 1 November 1995 it was second-best of 12 funds in
the sector according to Micropal. The Smaller Companies unit trust has
been less successful, its performance in the five years to November
earning it 56th place among 73 funds.

Schroders appointed Andrew Rose, an institutional fund manager, to run
the unit trust and Jonathan Bolton, who currently manages another
Japanese unit trust, to run the Japan Growth Fund.

NEWS: FINANCE BILL - WRECKING CREW

Labour will attempt to derail the government's reforms of executive
share options and taxation as it tries to capitalise on John Major's
dwindling majority and amend the Finance Bill.

Labour believes the bill could be the key to its campaign to undermine
the government, which has a majority of five after the defection of
Devon MP Emma Nicholson to the Liberal Democrats.

Chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced in November's Budget speech that
profits on share options worth up to pounds 20,000 and granted to
employees since 17 July 1995 would be subject to capital gains tax
rather than income tax. The chancellor also said that share options
granted under a scheme approved by the taxman would escape income tax.
A spokeswoman for Andrew Smith, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,
said the government was watering down its support for recommendations
made in the Greenbury Report.

Labour will also use Finance Bill debates to try to delay the
introduction of the new system of self-assessment for tax. The new
system, due to begin in April, will cost business and the self-employed
an extra pounds 850m in the 1998-99 tax year, Labour claims.

IF Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's forecast of 3 per cent growth in GDP
comes through in 1996 something nice should happen to profits from
Airtours, the UK's second-biggest holiday operator after Thomson
Travel. Profits could recover strongly anyway from the level of 1994-95
when Airtours had its first profits fall since getting its listing in
1987.

The key will be how well Airtours manages to protect its profit
margins. The nature of the package-tour business is that too often it
is just too easy for operators to sacrifice margins in the pursuit of
extra volumes. When demand then fails to materialise - as was the case
in the UK last year - profits fall out of bed as they are still faced
with the sticky overheads of chartered air seats and booked hotel
rooms. The imperative of covering those overheads can turn into an
unseemly scramble and wipe out profits. Indeed, ABN Amro Hoare Govett,
stockbroker to Airtours, estimates that its profits per holidaymaker
from UK tour operating alone - stripping out the contribution from
Airtours' in-house airline - dropped from pounds 13 in 1991 to pounds 7
in 1994 and a loss last year.

However, just as operational gearing can take away, so it can also
give. On Hoare Govett's sensitivity analysis, pre-interest profits from
UK tour operating can swing from zero to pounds 37m depending in
particular on demand in the crucial holiday decision time in May and
June.

With this in mind, operators have cut capacity for the coming summer;
total market capacity is probably down by about 14 per cent.
Additionally, prices in the Airtours catalogues are up 8-10 per cent.
The first test will come this month, as January is the biggest booking
period of the year (though not the most important). A dull response
could mean that Airtours and others will go for a combination of
further capacity cuts plus some discounting. Such a scenario would not
be disastrous, but would result in the sort of outcome forecast in the
table opposite. A more optimistic view of demand would imply pre-tax
profits of pounds 75m or more.

Besides, Airtours has other things going for it: airlines and hotels
operations which, so long as they confine themselves to serving the
tour-operating side, keep extra profit in-house; a travel agency that
is to some extent contracyclical and an excellent Scandinavian tour
operator, which in its first full year as part of the Airtours group
contributed pounds 25m pre-tax against an pounds 80m acquisition cost.

As to how to play the opportunity, Airtours has an inviting convertible
which yields 7.1 per cent and trades at a mere 4 per cent premium to
the ordinary. It has marginally less gearing (pounds 1 of convertible
buys 96p of equity), but the income difference must mean it is the one
for income seekers. That said, either stock is worth buying.

RADIO advertising revenues continue to grow rapidly. Even if the pace
slows, radio will still grow faster than other advertising media. The
Advertising Association recently downgraded its forecast for total
advertising growth for 1996 from 11 to 8 per cent, but kept its
prediction for radio advertising at 17 per cent; that compares with an
estimated 25 per cent rise in 1995. One of the beneficiaries will be
Capital Radio. It is cash-rich and in a good position to grow. There is
also the added spice that relaxation of cross-media ownership rules
could make it a bid target.

At the start of the 1990s radio's share of display advertising was
under 3 per cent. It is now well on the way to achieving 6 per cent by
the end of the decade. Part of this growth has come from the launch of
national radio stations, but much is due to existing stations selling
the advantages of radio advertising. London has become particularly
competitive in recent years with new stations starting up. While
Capital has inevitably lost market share, it continues to dominate. In
the third quarter of 1995 38 per cent of radio listeners tuned in to
Capital Gold on AM or Capital FM each week. As the market leader,
advertisers still make a beeline for it. Last year, underlying revenues
for all the company's radio stations grew by 21 per cent. This was
partly due to better performances from its Midlands and Southern
stations.

Capital only has around 10 per cent of the available percentage points
used to guage market share in the industry. It can hold up to 15 per
cent, so there is plenty of scope for expansion with cash in the
coffers to finance it. It is looking at new regional licences that are
coming up for grabs.

Under proposed media ownership rules, any media company with less than
20 per cent of its own market can buy itself up to 15 per cent of
another sector. That makes Capital an ideal target for an acquisitive
company operating in another branch of the media.

Stockbroker Merrill Lynch calculates that every extra 1 per cent on
revenues is worth around pounds 370,000 in extra profit. Buy for
continued growth plus the takeover possibilities.

DE LA RUE has few friends. Two profits warnings last year led to a
slump in its shares and their subsequent demotion from the FT-SE 100
index. It is time to reassess prospects. De La Rue's ability to
generate cash and its strong market positions are not doubted while
National Lottery organiser Camelot is starting to make a contribution
to profits.

Acquiring paper maker Portals a year ago looked like management taking
its eye off the ball. Yet Portals already contributes strongly to
profits and peripheral activities, such as making tea bags, have been
sold.

The banknote market is growing at 4 per cent per annum. Taking a longer-
term perspective, the integration of banknote printing and paper-making
should help De La Rue gain business through improved anti-
counterfeiting technology. The current order book has improved although
this is at lower margins.

Payment and transaction systems were supposed to take up the running
from banknotes, but they have had problems. Garny is having to cope
with stiff competition in Germany and US bank mergers hit demand for
cash machines. The trend towards increasing automation of banking is
unchanged, though. Therefore demand for the company's cash-handling
equipment should continue to grow for the foreseeable future.

Management needs to convince cynical investors that it won't slip up
again. This will take time, but we expect it to achieve this by the end
of the year. Buy.

HOW will Greenalls exploit its augmented buying power in 1996?
Skilfully, suggests the management's record. The pounds 527m purchase
of Boddington in October adds 454 outlets to the pub estate, bringing
it to 2,300, of which 1,100 are managed in-house. Though this is only 4
per cent of the UK total, the group's pubs are much higher volume than
average. Given the 20 per cent overcapacity in UK brewing, Greenalls'
enhanced position as the largest chain among the independents (those
not owned by brewers) means it is better placed than ever to buy beer
cheaply.

Greenalls' main supplier is Carlsberg/Tetley, Boddington's is
Whitbread. There are long-term supply agreements in place, till 1998
with Carlsberg/Tetley, and till 2000 with Whitbread. There is, however,
plenty of room to vary contract terms which cover only part of the
retailer's needs. Assuming it can push Whitbread product through former
Boddington pubs, and do likewise with Carlsberg/Tetley brands in
Boddington outlets, the group is in a strong position to buy cheaper
liquid, especially as the brewers always face the temptation to sell
extra volume at a very low price to get that last drop of profit.

Greenalls' finance director, Alan Rothwell, points out that the group
does virtually no business with Scottish Courage, adding that the
regional brewers are a loose cannon in capacity terms. The fact that
brewers need to renew their contracts well ahead of expiry date gives a
retailer, like Greenalls, scope to secure good buying terms for the
present as well. Boddington was bought for 21.5 times its 1994
earnings, which is why the forecast numbers in the table below are so
tame. But the beer supply/demand picture suggest that growth will
rapidly become apparent.

Elsewhere, the hotels division continues to grow nicely. The off-
licence and wholesaling businesses fit with pubs, the 500 off-licences
giving the group buying power in spirits and wines, while the pubs give
the off-licences leverage in beer. Tavern, the wholesale operation
being combined with Boddington's Liquid Assets, also benefits from the
group's extra buying power. Though not as big as Matthew Clarke,
wholesaling could be better positioned as far as price is concerned.

The stock, No. 104 by stock market capitalisation, is tapping at the
door of the FT-SE 100 club. If Greenalls gets in, index-tracking funds

IT IS all coming together for Wescol, the Halifax-based structural
steelmaker. One of only two quoted structural steelmakers to survive
the last recession, Wescol is making the most of a strong market. It
has improved efficiency and will benefit from the growing success of
its patented cellular steel beam.

Demand for structural steelwork - used in football grounds and large
buildings such as factories and shopping centres - is expected to grow
almost 5 per cent in 1996. The growth in sales now follows a near-
catastrophic collapse in the market after a 1989 sales peak of 1.4m
tonnes. About 250 fabricators vanished from the industry. Wescol is one
of seven key survivors. The rest include the other quoted structural
steel company, Severfield-Reeve, the privately owned William Hare and
subsidiaries of Rugby and Amec.

Structural steelwork has escaped the worst of the problems affecting
the rest of the construction industry and prospects look good for the
next 18 months. Wescol is also working hard to build exports, which
should buffer the company from any collapse in UK demand. Exports
should chip in 15 per cent of sales in 1995-96. A joint venture with a
Singapore contractor gives Wescol a way into Asian-Pacific construction
contracts, particularly in China, and Wescol is considering further
joint ventures of this type.

In the UK the company has just quadrupled the space available in its
Halifax factory. However, Wescol will continue to sub-contract some of
its work. Sub-contracted work earns a lower margin, but it also
transfers some of the risk from the repeated delays common in
construction contracts.

Westok, the group's cellular beam maker, is 'going like a train' the
company says. Wescol invented the cellular beam - a steel beam with
holes that offers increased strength without increased weight. For now
Westok remains a relatively small part of the business, 8 per cent of
turnover, but the cellular beam is growing in popularity with engineers
and architects.

Marbank, the last bit of the group, is a niche contractor specialising
in work worth about pounds 500,000. It is doing well, against the
contracting trend in the UK, but is not a key part of the group.

Wescol had a gruelling time in the early 1990s. Its mistakes on bad
debts and rampaging gearing mean it has taken longer to recover than
Severfield-Reeve and the Yorkshire rival still tends to overshadow
Wescol's potential. But it has learnt its lesson and 1996 should be the
year Wescol proves its point. Buy the shares.

BETWEEN May 1993 and December 1995, Conrad Ritblat's net assets grew
from pounds 1m to pounds 34m. Chaired by property guru John Ritblat,
the company has in recent months paid Allied Domecq pounds 10.6m for
109 pubs that are let to Burtonwood Brewery, bought a portfolio of nine
properties from the Royal Bank of Scotland for pounds 9.9m and more
than doubled the size of its property consultancy operation with the
pounds 400,000 acquisition of rival Colliers Erdman Lewis (CEL).

Conrad Ritblat is a hybrid in the property sector in that its
activities include chartered surveying as well as property ownership
and rental. Not well understood, its shares fail to discount prospects
for rising profits in conjunction with asset growth.

Executive director Philip Lewis describes the CEL acquisition as a
'real coup'. Conrad Ritblat has managed CEL since a receiver was
appointed in October. Since then, it has downsized operations by
shedding staff and closing or rationalising regional offices. At a
budgeted pounds 12m, CEL's fee income will be sharply down in 1995. It
peaked at pounds 25m. But even at the reduced level, it will double the
turnover of Conrad Ritblat's estate agency business.

Having expanded this side of its operations, the company hopes to
funnel more business through it. It initiated both the Allied Domecq
and Royal Bank of Scotland deals and they were structured so that
Conrad Ritblat has been promised more of these companies' traditional
property consultancy work. As well as pounds 5.5m cash, Royal Bank of
Scotland received 16m Conrad Ritblat shares in exchange for its
properties. They were issued at 27.5p against a then market price of
23p. It will own 11.8 per cent of the enlarged equity.

Conrad Ritblat's existing properties in the City and West End are both
pretty much fully let. About 15,000 square feet of its premises at 9
Marylebone Lane are let to M&C Saatchi, the Saatchi brothers' new
advertising agency. It also owns properties in Glasgow and Leeds.

Ahead of February's interims, no forecasts were available for 1995-96.
In any event, the full impact of recent deals won't be felt until 1996-
97 when profits of between pounds 3m and pounds 4m are possible. Conrad
Ritblat looks a strong growth story; buy.

ELECTRONICS giant GEC's managing director Lord Weinstock, 72 in the
summer, is retiring this year, which should add some spice to the share
price. The shares will soar if a high-calibre recruit, preferably from
outside, is appointed to fill the void. GEC has some superb, if
underperforming assets. Its cash mountain, even after splashing out
pounds 800m on submarine builder VSEL last year, totals over pounds
1bn. Another pounds 1.3bn cash is in joint ventures. Some of this could
- and arguably should - be handed back to shareholders.

Trading-wise GEC is not in bad shape either. Its order book stands at a
record pounds 13.7bn while profits are expected to lift off a six-year
plateau this year. Marconi, its defence and aerospace electronics arm,
is going into the production phase on a number of key projects. Cost
overrun problems of the past seem to be resolved. Recovery prospects
from aerospace look good. Defence faces the challenge of slimmer
government budgets. But a major joint venture followed by restructuring
could bring beneficial effects. Its telecommunications and power
systems arms are already within joint ventures. Review of GEC's fourth
leg - a mixed bag of industrial operations - is long overdue.

The appointment of a worthy successor to Lord Weinstock could make a
big difference to sentiment. Buy ahead of the announcement.

Cairn's share price this year will be made or broken by what happens in
bangladesh. cairn has 100 per cent interests in two potentially
enormous gas fields there. drilling started in december and if the
results are good, industry analysts estimate the upside in cairn's
asset value at 100p per share plus.

Cairn's recent record suggests it has a better-than-even chance of
unlocking that potential. Since 1992 the company has transformed
itself, helped by its US subsidiary, CEUSA, hitting a massive gas field
in the Gulf of Mexico. CEUSA has since been sold for about pounds 32m
and the money used to build a portfolio of cash-generating assets in
the UK and Netherlands. These will fund the development in Bangladesh,
and other blue sky prospects in Thailand, Vietnam and China.

Ignoring anything that may happen in Bangladesh, house broker Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull estimates that Cairn's net assets are worth
95p per share anyway. Results of the first Bangladeshi well, offshore
on Block 16, are expected at the end of this month. The most optimistic
brokers' estimates suggest there is 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas in
both of Cairn's prospects. That could be worth up to pounds 160m or
pounds 2 per share to Cairn. Therefore there is the potential that
realisable net assets of almost pounds 3 will play a share price of
115p. By any criteria of buying assets for less than their face value,
that makes for an attractive prospect.

Admittedly the risks are big, too. Cairn has first to find the gas and
establish that it's feasible to extract it economically; then it must
negotiate a deal to build a power station to burn it and agree terms
with the government. But if the drilling news is good, the share price
will reflect the possibilities well in advance. The shares are a gamble
but also a buy.

PILKINGTON has been transformed from a sleepy family-run business prone
to strategic blunders to a fast-growing global glass maker. It has
untangled itself from its disastrous foray into contact lenses,
stripped out pounds 200m of overheads and expanded into developing
markets.

In the short term, recovery in the mature European and US glass markets
will power profits. Volumes should rise by 3 per cent next year and
prices have begun to harden. With its cost-cutting programme in full
swing, margins could increase from 8 per cent to 10 per cent over the
next two years.

Acquisitions will also fuel growth. The proceeds of a recent pounds
303m rights issue has been put to good use. Pilkington paid pounds 120m
to buy the remaining 50 per cent of Italian car glass manufacturer SIV.
The pounds 55m purchase of glass merchants Interpane also gives it a
foothold in the Swiss and Scandinavian markets.

Glass making remains a cyclical business and demand will peak by 1998.
But Pilkington's rapid expansion abroad leaves it well placed to ride
out any downturn. Developing countries currently account for a third of
profits, but earnings should rocket over the next few years. South
America is the fastest-growing market in the world and Pilks is already
the leading glass maker in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. There is also
huge potential in China and to build on its presence in Eastern Europe
from its stronghold in Poland.

Pilkington's resurgence is being helped by a range of new high-margin
products. Sales of insulating K-glass have soared and EZ-Kool, which
reflects infra-red rays, has proved popular with motor manufacturers.
Stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull forecasts that recovery
will push Pilkington's profits to pounds 310m in 1997, meaning that the
shares are only 10 times that year's expected earnings. Buy.

ABACUS is making all the right moves in the booming electronic
components market. Demand for non-computer electronics should increase
by at least 12 per cent in 1996. Although this is a slight slowdown on
last year, with UK inflation at under 3 per cent electrocomponents
remains one of industry's fastest-growing markets.

On past performance, Abacus is odds-on to outstrip that growth. Over
the last few years the group has been steadily winning market share.
Abacus aims to forge links with customers via regional sales offices
which look after just a handful of accounts. Abacus is the only large
distributor that sources components from both franchised manufacturers -
 Abacus has 34, including household names Siemens, Toshiba and
Panasonic - and overseas. This gives it an enviable spread of products
and the flexibility to offer dedicated stocks and just-in-time
supplies. In a market where customers are cutting back their number of
suppliers, Abacus's focus on service is spot-on.

November's pounds 36m acquisition of Polar looks a good fit. The two
have only one franchised supplier and just 10 per cent of their top 300
customers in common. Polar brings another 26 franchised suppliers and
doubles the number of customers to over 4,000, establishing Abacus as
the UK's fifth-largest distributor. With scope to increase
productivity, Abacus is looking to push Polar's 7 per cent margins
closer to its own 12 per cent in the UK. And Polar's technical strength
in component design adds a new element to Abacus's portfolio.

With minimal borrowings, even after Polar, expansion in Europe is next.
Last year's Scandinavian acquisition, Promax, is performing excellently
and Abacus has just opened an office in the key German market.

The share rating does not reflect Abacus-cum-Polar's strong UK market
position nor the benefits of expansion abroad. Buy.

MARKET STRATEGY: NOT A TIME TO JUNK THE LESSONS OF HISTORY

At year-end 1994, with the FT-SE 100 limping along near 3000, most
forecasters were quite restrained in their expectations for the year
ahead. This was despite the fact that a number of historical trends,
some running for most of this century, flagged a rise to 3700
(accurately, as it turned out) over the next 12 months.

Many of the same long-term trends are now warning of possible
disappointment to UK equity investors in 1996. Here are three worth
watching.

The dividend yield of the FT-SE-A All-Share index currently stands
below 4 per cent. From a historical perspective, this is quite ominous.

Since the All-Share was initiated in 1962, the dividend yield has ended
the year below 4 per cent on just five occasions. On four of these
occasions, share prices fell in the following year. The usual pattern
was for the bottom to be reached in mid-year, followed by a mild
recovery.

The year-end 1971 signal was a short-lived exception. Prices rose by 17
per cent in the next few months, despite the historical experience. But
the April peak turned out to be the start of the UK's worst-ever bear
market. Although shares held on to some of these profits at yearend,
the down-trend continued for two more years, ultimately dropping prices
by a mind-numbing 69 per cent.

Another important signal is provided by the cyclical indicators,
published each month by the Central Statistical Office to help
interested organisations and individuals to monitor the state of the UK
economy. Although the indices were not designed for this purpose, they
make an excellent tool for forecasting stock market ebbs and flows.

Two cyclical indices worth monitoring are the Shorter Leading Index,
which flags turning points in the economy six months ahead of time, and
the Coincident Index, designed to rise and fall in lock step with
actual economic growth.

Since 1959, when the series was first published, a late-in-the-cycle
rise on the Shorter Leading Index above the preceding month's score and
a reading above average on the Coincident Index has consistently been
associated with bull market peaks.

The signal sometimes flashes very early, as much as one year in
advance, so we can only use it as a rough timing guide even though it
is a powerful bear market signal. At present the message from the
cyclical indicators is quite clear. This stock market upturn will end
no later than April 1996.

The third signal - the most important of all - is the length of time
this rally has run. After a sharp price drop in the first half of 1994,
prices bottomed out in June and have been rising ever since, six
quarters in a row.

No-one knows when this upturn will end, but continuous rises for more
than four quarters are very rare. There have been just 12 in the UK
this century. No recent upward move has run longer than seven quarters
in a row. Using history as a guide, the odds are very low that the
current upturn will continue for much longer.

What will happen once the upturn ends? Here, too, history provides a
valuable clue. After continuous quarterly upward moves run their
course, shares usually decline, often for just three to six months,
followed by a recovery that lifts prices back towards the starting
point. When the smoke clears, generally nine to 12 months after the
uptrend is first broken, prices are, at best, close to their starting
point.

Putting it all together, history suggests a disappointing 1996 with the
path to the year-end more like a roller-coaster ride than a stroll
along a sleepy country lane. When the smoke clears 12 months from now,
look for a FT-SE 100 at around the 3700 level.

In the US, 1996 is a presidential election year. Politically, then, it
is a time of great excitement and uncertainty. But the stock market
will take no notice of this, following the same old patterns that have
applied in the past.

Since 1928, there have been 12 presidential election years that were
preceded with a share price increase of at least 10 per cent the year
before. 1995 is number 13 in the series. Wall Street rose each and
every time in the election year that followed. The average election
year price increase was 16 per cent, suggesting a rise to near 6000 on
the Dow Jones by December 1996.

The Tokyo stock market has been in free fall since 1990. History
provides two precedents for a stock market decline of such magnitude
and duration: the 86 per cent smash on Wall Street in 1929-32 and the
69 per cent London fall in 1972-74. Both recoveries began with very
sharp price increases, 38 per cent in each of two successive months in
New York, and a 51 per cent single month rise in London.

Tokyo is not following the norm despite the fact that it is a much more
volatile stock market than London or New York. So far, the recovery
from its mid-year low has been comparatively mild (the Nikkei 225 is up
by 37 per cent from the early July low). This raises the suspicion that
the bottom may not yet been reached.

For 1996, there are two possible scenarios for Tokyo. The market will
either continue to drift up as it has done in the second half of 1995,
or drop sharply in a bloody finale to the bear market that has consumed
most of the 1990s.

If it does drop sharply, the recovery will be equally breathtaking.
Either way, I forecast that the Nikkei will rest near 22,000 at year-
end 1996.

MARKET STRATEGY: JAPAN - WAITING ON THE LOCALS

THE Japanese stock market ended the year with a flourish. After briefly
hitting the 20,000 level for the first time in 14 months, the Nikkei
225 index finally finished at 19,868.

Although this was less than 1 per cent higher than the previous
December's close, it nonetheless represented a remarkable 37 per cent
gain on the year's low of 14,485 recorded in early July, when fears of
a re-run of the panic which prevailed in the summer of 1992 were at
their height.

Key factors in the second half's optimism included a sustained fall in
the yen against the dollar, a continued decline in short- and long-term
interest rates, further recovery in corporate earnings, and yet greater
fiscal stimulation by the government (the recently published draft
budget for 1996-97 does, moreover, propose the sharpest rise in public
spending for five years).

To add icing to the cake, worries about a banking crisis have receded
because of the government's involvement in the rescue package for
stricken housing loan companies.

Despite increasing confidence that, this time, Japan's economic
recovery will prove to be for real, it is nonethless striking that
domestic institutions continue to remain firmly on the stock market
sidelines. In 1995, as in 1994, locals were heavy sellers of equities.
If the market's latest rally is not to fizzle out, domestic
institutions will soon need to pick up the buying baton from
foreigners.

MARKET STRATEGY: THE BURSTING OF THE ASIAN BUBBLE

Having lost pounds 800,000 on his holdings of Thai stocks, Vivat
Srisammacheep walked onto the floor of the Bangkok Stock Exchange in
November and shot himself in the chin. His consternation, if not his
aiming, was understandable. Usually, when US stocks rise, Thai stocks
rise by more. Not in 1995, however. That was the first year since 1980
that the Thai market had fallen while the US had risen.

As goes Thailand, so go south east Asian equities generally. Their
falls last year mean that they are now back to the lows of 1992-93 when
compared with US stocks.

So why did these markets become decoupled from the US? The principal
reason lies in the fears of 'overheating' that struck the region. Rapid
economic growth has caused rising inflation (although in Malaysia and
Thailand this has been held down by stiffer price controls) and huge
trade deficits. Ng Bok Eng of Morgan Grenfell foresees the Malaysian
deficit rising to 9.3 per cent of GDP, and the Thai gap rising to 7.5
per cent. These are huge numbers; when the UK had its last balance of
payments crisis in 1989, the deficit was a mere 4.3 per cent of GDP. To
curb this overheating, interest rates have risen.

In itself, this need not have had disastrous effects upon the markets.
After all, the trade deficits were largely the result of purchases of
capital goods by Japanese companies which had set up in the area, so
the borrowing from overseas would be expected to pay for itself in due
course. And anyway, Malaysian stocks rose in 1991, when interest rates
rose by more than they did this year, as did Indonesian stocks in 1990.

Unfortunately, after the collapse of the Mexican peso last December,
overseas investors became particularly jumpy about trade imbalances.
Hence they sold the Indonesian, Thai and Malaysian markets even though
their deficits were no worse this year than in 1990 or 1991.

Once this selling had depressed the markets, other problems exacerbated
the decline. In Thailand, private investors like the hapless Mr
Srisammacheep, who had bought with borrowed money, were forced to sell
stock to meet margin payments. In Indonesia, investors feared that
looming privatisations would depress prices - fears which were borne
out by the unsuccessful sell-off of Tambang Timah. And in Malaysia the
circulation of forged share certificates and the drop in the price of
palm oil hit stocks.

With these markets now at two- or three-year lows relative to the US,
isn't it time to buy? Maybe not. Most expect further rises in interest
rates, and warn that the huge trade gaps may weaken the currencies.
Equally worrying, if not more so, last year's decoupling from Wall
Street may not be a permanent structural change. It could be the result
of temporary factors, such as the aftermath of the Mexican crisis and
overheating in the region. If so, then these markets would be
vulnerable to any weakness on Wall Street. Traditionally, when it has
sneezed, Asian markets have caught colds; in the two months after the
1987 crash, when US stocks fell 20 per cent, the Thai and Malaysian
markets halved.

Nevertheless, some predict good returns later in 1996. Alan Butler-
Henderson at Barings believes that overheating problems will fade next
year as capital spending slows down (particularly in Malaysia) whilst
growth outside the region picks up. Once this happens, he says,
'markets in South East Asia should enjoy a much better year' and we
should 'be prepared for an impressive run' in Malaysian stocks in the
second half of 1996. By the spring, the region's markets may appear a
lot more attractive than Mr Srisammacheep.

MARKET STRATEGY: UK SECTORS - PLACE YOUR BETS

Polarisation was the name of the sector game in 1995. At one extreme
were the beneficiaries of the favoured themes of international growth,
interest-rate sensitivity, and corporate activity. Pharmaceuticals and
financials (life assurance, banks and to a lesser extent insurance)
found themselves dominating the sector league table because they could
satisfy not merely one, but two, of these thematic requirements.

At the other extreme were the victims of the dread 'cyclicality'. The
worst-performing sector, gas distribution, was admittedly an exception
to this rule and owed its dunce's cap to the specific problems of
British Gas. Elsewhere amongst the laggards, however, so-called
'cyclicals' such as paper, packaging and printing, textiles, building
materials and the catch-all diversified industrials proved unable to
resist the mounting pressure of profit downgrades stemming from the low-
growth, low-inflation environment.

In the middle ground, with performances grouped around the All-Share's
19 per cent rise over the 12 months, tended to be the more defensive
consumer/services areas.

According to Goldman Sachs, the expected weakness in the UK economy in
the first half of 1996 means that investors should continue to follow
the sectoral lead already given - in a similar low-growth situation -
by the US.

On Wall Street, sector outperformance has been determined by what
Goldman describes as the holy trinity of technology, financial services
and growth. On its reading of US equities, these should still determine
outperformance in the UK. Banks, insurances, growth stocks in media and
drugs, and the smaller tech stocks are consequently on their buying
list, together with bid stocks.

Cyclicals, especially those which are price 'takers' as opposed to
price determiners (chemicals, packaging, components) are forecast to
remain out of favour.

In contrast, BZW believes it is time to look for opportunities within
the cyclicals, rather than dwell on past disappointments, because GDP
and earnings growth should be recovering in 1996, especially during the
second half as consumer spending becomes the major driving force.

After juggling with the three elements of inventories and costs (which
determine the margin outlook), and geographic exposure (the likely
source of volume growth) BZW selects building materials, diversified
industrials, and electronics as its top three industrial picks. For
exposure to the domestic consumer theme, general retailers, leisure and
wines/spirits are identified, at the expense of more defensive areas of
spending such as food retailing, food manufacturing or brewing.

Although 'international growth', epitomised by media and
pharmaceuticals stocks, should not be ignored, says BZW, they could
take a temporary back seat in favour of cheaper growth alternatives.
The hitherto high-performing banks sector is viewed with concern, on
the grounds that the banks are vulnerable to rising real interest
rates.

MARKET STRATEGY: WALL STREET - ADDING VALUE?

Most US-market watchers agree that in 1996 there will be low inflation
and modest growth. But if the value of goods and services produced
grows only slowly, how can the value of the companies making them rise
quickly? There are several reasons, all of which have combined in the
1990s to send equity prices rising far above money GDP. The share of
output going to profits has risen, thanks to strong productivity growth
and low wage growth. Lower bond yields and greater economic stability
mean these higher profits are discounted less heavily. And recently,
merger activity has - it is hoped - raised the efficiency with which
growth is delivered.

But it is doubtful whether these forces can persist. Stephen S Roach at
Morgan Stanley warns that, with unemployment now low, 'the days of
asking labour to keep sacrificing appear to be largely over'. A 'worker
backlash' would either squeeze profits or raise inflation, and hence
bond yields. Mr Roach expects the latter. 'Everything good is just
about priced into the market,' he says. 'As inflation fails to conform
to consensus prognostications, the next big move in yields is back
towards 7 per cent.'

But Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber says corporate restructuring is far
from complete. A theme of 1996, he says, will be 'disaggregation', as
peripheral businesses are sold off. 'Such deals,' he says, 'are often a
win-win proposition for shareholders. Spun-off businesses tend to
outperform the market and many companies initiating disaggregation also
tend to be strong performers; recent examples include AT&T and ITT.'

Unfortunately, if Mr Kerschner is right, the winners will be specific
stocks, whilst if Mr Roach is right, the losers will be the entire
market. Investors' best hope lies in the low inflation, low interest
rate consensus proving correct - even if this destroys earnings growth.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: UK STRATEGY - THEMES FOR '96

The accepted orthodoxies of the Christmas season can all too soon
become the Aunt Sallies of the new year, according to BZW. This is a
particular risk at present, given how hard the stock market is buying
the low-growth, low-interest-rate argument.

With very much a 12-month view in mind, BZW chooses instead to stress
the following themes.

First, the 'pause' interpretation of the economy seems most tenable.
Growth is expected to recover sharply in the second half of the year,
led by consumers. Growth of 2.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent is expected
in 1996 and 1997, respectively. On this reading, base rate rises late
this year are on the cards.

Admittedly, there will be limited political appetite to raise rates
with a general election looming. However, BZW sees no benefit for the
financial markets if politics is clearly seen to prevail over
economics. Short-term interest rates may not rise, but in such
circumstances long-term rates surely would.

Moreover, the risks on the currency increase as the election gets
nearer. BZW anticipates a sterling/dollar rate of dollars 1.44 in 1996,
but a rally in the pound to DM2.30 when the US dollar strengthens.

As far as gilts are concerned, stronger nominal GDP growth is rarely
the friend of the market. Ten-year yields are forecast to move back to
8.25 per cent.

BZW's view of growth signals that the current weight of profit
downgrades may not be long-lasting. However, equities could remain
driven more by interest rates than earnings, with cash-financed
takeover activity less of a positive factor. A dull 1996 is
anticipated, with 3750 as the year-end FT-SE 100 forecast. Preferred
sectors are building materials, electronics and general retailers.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: GLOBAL STRATEGY - MORE DIFFICULT

For 1996, Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley thinks that the crucial asset
allocation is to be underweight in US equities, pondering the sale of
US bonds, and overweight in Asia.

Although 1996 is likely to be a less happy year than 1995, a
synchronised bear market is not anticipated. At this point cash is
unattractive because the indicators of the liquidity cycle continue to
be very favourable, central banks are easing and interest rates are
falling.

At the same time it is evident that economic growth in Europe, Japan
and North America is at best sluggish. In Europe, the sluggishness is
spreading from the D-Mark bloc to the weak-currency countries on
Europe's periphery. In Japan, the latest Tankan report was only
superficially encouraging. In the rest of Asia, high real interest
rates are slowing growth.

Meanwhile, inflation in the developed world is very low, and the loss
of pricing power is becoming a serious problem for many companies.
However, Mr Biggs doesn't buy the story that the world is on the brink
of a deflationary episode that would be bullish for high-grade bonds
but bearish for equities.

Sometime next year, probably in the second half, the big-locomotive
economies of the industrial world - the US, Japan, and Germany - will
begin to revive. This will be good news for politicians and working
people, but bad news for investors, who will begin worrying about a
pick-up in inflation and higher interest rates. The best guess is that
the recovery won't be sufficiently synchronised, and that while it may
cause a cyclical bear market in the US, there will only be a correction
in what will by then be bull markets in Japan, emerging Asia and the
other emerging markets.

The other risk is that the excess liquidity currently being created
causes a bubble in financial markets that pops at the first indication
of Fed tightening, as happened in late 1993. The mania over technology
stocks and the high degree of bond-buyer bullishness gives some basis
for this worry, as does the fact that valuations are filthy rich,
particularly in the US. Nonetheless, the individual bubbles can
probably be pricked without precipitating a global bear market.

As far as currencies are concerned, the dominant force will be yen
weakness, as the Bank of Japan prints paper and Japan's trade surplus
falls rapidly. The dollar will have an upward bias, as will many
countries in emerging Asia.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: SPAIN - STILL TIME TO BUY

Despite its recent outperformance relative to Europe (ex UK), Spain
will continue to outperform well into the first quarter of 1996,
according to Merrill Lynch.

The key factors are a continued rally in the bond market, falling
interest rates and the prospect of political change. Spanish earnings
momentum has been remarkably stable yet the stock market is still
trading at a 15 per cent discount to its historical average prospective
PE ratio of 13. As a result, the potential upside clearly outweighs any
downside risk.

The Spanish-German bond yield differential has narrowed sharply over
the past three months, and should narrow further. Although part of the
improvement in Spanish bonds has come from external factors, such as
the continuing strength of US bonds and the recent cut in German
interest rates, the rest will come domestically from the improving
inflation outlook and a reduced political risk premium.

Perhaps the biggest change in 1996 will be on the political front,
where early general elections are expected to be called for the second
half of March. The most recent poll shows the Partido Popular (PP) has
built up a 16-point lead over the Socialists. Although it will probably
be a minority government, the big issue is what policy changes the PP
would actually make and how far they would go in resolving Spain's
inflation, unemployment and budget-deficit problems. In reality it is
still too early to make an informed judgment.

While Spain would obviously be affected by a collapse in the US bond
markets and renewed concerns over European monetary union - or rather,
the lack of budgetary discipline that convergence criteria currently
provide - short-term performance will be most sensitive to the current
test case in France.

Nevertheless Merrill believes the market will run up between now and
the election, followed by a period of profit-taking.

After that, it depends on the market's belief in the political change
argument. One thing is certain: it won't be right to be neutral over
the longer term.

119m in July 1994 and immediately invested half that money - the trust
was 'in a hurry to get the money in' with much going into an overweight
position in smaller companies and banks. This made a deleterious impact
on asset value. The trust has recently geared up via a pounds 20m loan,
much of which has been invested in consumer-related and smaller company
shares. The trust has never hedged its currency exposure.

This Henderson-managed trust turned in a 'disappointing performance'
last year. partly because smaller Japanese companies underperformed but
also because, on the assumption that Japan was on the verge of
recovery, it hedged the currency and increased its gearing. But those
two factors could boost performance this year provided smaller company
shares start to perform: at end-July more than 90 per cent of the fund
was invested in companies with a market value below pounds 710m.

Last year the trust restructured into growth and income annuity shares.
But it is not classified as a split capital trust because there is no
wind-up date; instead income shares convert into growth shares in 2001
on a 1000-to-1 basis.

In 1995 the trust reduced its cash and fixed-interest holdings from 38
to 29 per cent. It then reinvested most of the money in ordinary
investment trust shares. For all that, its largest holding remains M&G
shares which, at end-August, were valued at pounds 7.9m and accounted
for almost 13 per cent of the portfolio.

There's a new-look team managing the trust following Marc Gordon's

'almost frenzied corporate activity'. At end-September half the
portfolio was invested in FT-SE Mid 250 shares and the balance in
smaller companies.

INVESTMENT SOFTWARE: A PACKAGE FOR LAID-BACK INVESTORS

INVESTORS are a varied bunch. From the bustle of the day trader to the
comparative inactivity of the long-term buy- and-hold strategist. The
last two reviews have examined sub-pounds 250 software packages
suitable for the investor who falls in the middle of this range. Both
programs (Windows on Wall Street and Metastock for Windows) assume that
the investor has access to daily data and a bias towards technical
analysis. Pricetrack, by contrast, is a small DOS-based program more
suited to the less active investor. Although certainly not as
sophisticated or visually attractive as the other two programs, the
software includes some practical features and includes a data service
in the price.

Although the program will run under a DOS extension from Windows,
installation takes place from the DOS prompt. The manual does, however,
recommend running the memory optimisation utility included with later
versions of DOS (Memmaker) before attempting to run Pricetrack. This is
because the software uses a lot of expanded memory and will run like a
snail if it is not available. In virtually every case, running Memmaker
and following the instructions provided will ensure smooth operation.
Pricetrack does offer mouse support, so you don't have to learn an
irritating selection of multiple keyboard commands in order to operate
it.

The program is structured around a set of Lotus spreadsheets and has
three main modules: the weekly share price system that allows database
manipulation and graphing; a reports section that collates fundamental
data on equities; and portfolio management. The largest module is the
weekly share price system which has four main menu sections (general,
sort, update and gain) and a separate set of charting commands. The
general menu allows switching into other menus and covers basic default
settings. Users can select whether they want keyboard or mouse control.
Pricetrack displays 'setpoint markers' on graphs that show year-ends.
These are quite obtrusive and can be disabled if required.

The gain menu uses the spreadsheet base of the program to best
advantage and allows ranking of shares according to a number of
criteria. The entire database (some 580 equities and indices) can be
sorted in order of gains made in the last one, four or 52 weeks,
obviously handy when checking the consistency of an equity's
performance. For those looking to balance a portfolio, it is also
possible to rank the equities within their individual FT sectors over
the same periods as well. The individual sectors are listed first in
the spreadsheet followed by the shares in each sector in performance
ranking for the period.

As with most sorting functions on a computer, the speed of this
operation will depend on your processor - on a 486DX66 it was virtually
instantaneous. The sort menu provides similar functions to the gain
menu but for different criteria. The entire database can be placed in
descending order for market capitalisation or dividend yield over the
last one, four or 52 weeks. The database can also be set in sector
order following the usual financial times groupings.

The update menu processes the data supplied by Pricetrack Ltd and adds
it to the database. As the full database is large, users can extract a
selection of equities for monitoring. This extract function is carried
out by marking shares in the main database with a number. Users can use
codes to classify equities. For example, shares already owned could be
marked with '2', those under consideration for purchase with '4' and so
on. When extracted, shares in each category will then be grouped
together.

The reports database module supplies fundamental equity data (where
available) for both the current and previous year. Data includes last
dividend payments, net profit, earnings per share, total dividend,
turnover and net asset value. There is a sort facility available, but
it is only available for alphabetical listing or date of last company
report. It would be helpful if this facility could be extended to some
of the other data fields. As the database is large, a 'find' utility is
included which will search for an equity based on the first few letters
of the name. This is something of a godsend.

The portfolio valuation system allows multiple portfolio files to be
created that can be updated from the weekly system disk or a manually
updated extract file. For professional advisers handling a large number
of portfolios, a separate price file can be created from the weekly
system that will dramatically speed up valuation or printing. A total
portfolio valuation is displayed at the top of the worksheet, while
next to each equity is a figure for individual gain in both cash and
percentage terms since purchase. Entries can also be made for dealing
costs and cash on deposit.

The charting facilities of Pricetrack are fairly basic, with a low
resolution graphic display, but still perfectly comprehensible.
Investors with a technical bias are unlikely to get very excited. The
software offers a certain amount of flexibility to the investor keen on
comparing a number of equities for relative performance. Equities can
also be plotted against the FT-SE-A All-Share index, FT-SE 100 or any
relevant sector index.

For those accustomed to the more intuitive atmosphere of Windows-based
software, Pricetrack will take a while to get used to. Although there
are on-screen help files, a comprehensive manual would be an enormous
help as some of the program's features take quite a bit of finding. It
would also be good if basic functions such as Quit could be assigned
the same F key in all modules. The cost of Pricetrack ranges from
pounds 40 per annum for 12 monthly updates to pounds 150 for 50 weekly
ones. In all cases the data supplied is the Friday closing price.

Technical analysts and more active experienced investors will probably
want to look elsewhere, but for the beginner or someone who only uses
fundamental valuation techniques on a long-term basis, Pricetrack is
ideal.

Pricetrack is available from: Pricetrack Ltd, Bicknell Farm, Near
Nempnett Thrubwell, Blagdon, Avon, BS18 6XG. Phone: 01275 472306

POPULAR SHARES: BP GUSHES GOOD NEWS

British Petroleum is one of the great recovery stories of the past
three years. From dire straits in 1992 as worries over debt and
strategy mounted, the company is now firmly established as the top
explorer among the Seven Sisters - the giant European and US integrated
oil companies. All of the brokers we consulted were impressed with BP's
progress: the basic difference between the bulls and the bears is how
much further the recovery process can go.

At 537p, Morgan Stanley is a strong buyer. The strong exploration and
production portfolio (in Colombia, west of Shetlands, Gulf of Mexico
and Vietnam), and possible earnings enhancement from a restructuring of
the refining operations and continued cost reductions, mean BP is
undervalued relative to its peers. Earnings should grow by 42 per cent
to 38.5p for 1995 with a jump in the dividend to 15p (10.5p). EPS of
40.1p and 43.4p are forecast for 1996 and 1997. The chances of a
special dividend are good as cash flow improves, and the broker expects
the share price to go up to 580p.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett is another buyer. It reckons the shares are cheap
compared with the sector as a whole. Finds like the recently announced
Algerian gas deposits also reinforce the company's position in other
markets.

Natwest Securities is also keen. It's more optimistic than most on oil
prices and expects overcapacity in the refining market to sort itself
out. BP will lead the way in solving it with refinery closures in the
new year.

Kleinwort Benson is more cautious. It says the outlook on oil prices
and the chemicals cycle is not in the company's favour. The shares are
a hold.

Panmure Gordon expresses a similar view. The recovery story has nearly
worked its way through the system. If there is no additional news it
will be hard for the shares to outperform. Shell looks the better bet
as its cost-cutting programme is at a much earlier stage.

Charles Stanley is the only outright seller. It expects chemicals
earnings to be significantly lower this year and dividend growth to
slow after that.

Howden's spread of international businesses has been the key to its
success. Expansion into the developing markets of South Africa and the
Pacific Basin made up for problems in Germany and North America. Almost
two-thirds of its business comes from supplying fans to power-
generation and industrial markets. It found European demand going from
strength to strength and won two contracts to supply power stations in
China. Raw material price rises pushed its North American offshoot into
the red. Tunnelling profits were flat and German tunnelling equipment
maker Wirth is still struggling to break even with margins flattened by
competition and a demand downturn. But an order for offshore drills
from De Beers is good news.

Overall orders are healthy, at pounds 243 up 26 per cent on last year.
Howden's recent fall from the FT-SE Mid 250 index has wiped 25 per cent
off its share price over the last three months as index-tracking funds
have sold up. The slump in the price has left it looking good value
compared with its peers. Broker Bell Lawrie White forecasts full-year
profits rising to pounds 33m giving an inexpensive forward PE ratio of
eight. Good value.

(pounds 3.76m). Burndene is still reorganising BK Bluebird, the caravan
holiday homes manufacturer it bought last June. The benefits from this
won't show through for several months. Burndene's Willerby Caravan
operation managed to boost exports by 11 per cent, taking overseas
sales to 40 per cent of the total. Pretty Legs Hosiery did well in
spite of hot weather, although second-half profits were slightly lower.
Same-again profits of pounds 3.7m put the shares on a prospective PE
ratio of 13. With the support of a forward yield of 7 per cent the
shares are fairly priced.

Eurotherm has enjoyed 18 months of excellent trading following
recession. Capital investment in the process and paper industries has
returned. Continental European markets are better, and there's been
steady improvement in investment in the plastics industries, fuelling
Eurotherm's product sales. Turnover growth accelerated during the year
under review. First-half sales were up 11 per cent, second-half ones up
20 per cent. But there's been little impact yet from new products. A
new temperature controller was launched in September. More recently
there've been new devices for controlling electric motors and gauges
for use by packaging makers. More products are in the pipeline, the
result of pounds 8.6m (pounds 7.4m) spent on development last year.
That looks set to rise again this year. Eurotherm can well afford it.
It's been criticised for maintaining a large cash pile. But it's
answered this by pushing up its dividend. It's also added a US-based
drives business for pounds 4.4m. Profits are heading for pounds 40m
this year. The shares, on a forward PE ratio of 18, are up with events.

These are the last results from Polar, following an agreed pounds 36m
takeover by rival Abacus, creating the UK's fifth-largest concern in
the trade. The two have complementary products and little customer
overlap. Polar gets the chance to expand into Europe and lends strength
in component design, now generating over a third of sales. The group
has a lead in display components and microcontrollers. With Abacus at
270p, the offer of 159.6 Abacus shares for 100 Polar values Polar at
431p. The partial cash alternative - pounds 60.08 plus 135.66 Abacus
for 100 - is worth 427p. Accept the partial cash alternative.

Like rival Airtours, First Choice suffered in its main UK market,
largely because of the hot summer, which encouraged more people to
holiday at home. It also signalled a cut in capacity for next year,
which will mean the industry as a whole will shave the number of
packages by 15 per cent. That still means that almost 9m holidays will
be on offer.

The past 12 months perfectly examplify what happens when overcapacity
and a hot summer combine to hit First Choice's largest operation,
holidays in UK and Irish Republic. Despite turnover rising 4 per cent
to pounds 702m, profits dived from pounds 15m in 1994 to a loss of
pounds 12m.

First Choice's pounds 44m October rights issue to fund acquisitions,
which will help shift the balance away from summer to winter, will have
relatively little effect on the overall picture at the moment. Even its
market-leading Canadian tour operator, where profits more than doubled
to nearly pounds 8m, provides little in the way of comfort.

The problem is that the year revolves around a couple of months in
summer. If the company gets it right it has no need to shift an
inordinate number of holidays at cut price and margins look healthy. If
not, margins are slaughtered as it's forced to sell holidays at
unacceptable rates. Merrill Lynch expects 1995-96 profits to rebound to
pounds 22m, giving a forward PE ratio of 14. The shares are fairly
priced.

Months after flagging his intention to turn former marquee hirer Black
& Edgington into a pharmaceuticals company, chairman Ian Gowrie-Smith
has announced a massive share issue to fund its first major deal. Mr
Gowrie-Smith will inject Gibraltar-based drug development group Krypton
- majority-owned by his family's trust - into B&E, whose name will be
changed to SkyePharma. Krypton specialises in developing generic drugs,
and is working on anti-diabetic and heart treatments. With no trading
record, SkyePharma is transferring from the USM to Aim, where trading
should begin on 9 January.

The deal more than doubles B&E's ordinary equity to 1.1bn shares. The
group is funding the pounds 12m cost of Krypton by issuing 300m shares.
A one-for-four rights issue plus a 75m share placing at 4p will raise
pounds 9.3m. There are also 10 free warrants for every placing and
rights share. The group now has pounds 3.4m debt, but negative net
assets. After clearing the debt it'll have pounds 6m cash. Investors
also face a future share issue at 4p to raise a pounds 15m deferred
consideration for Krypton. B&E's shares were suspended in November when
it sold its marquee business. The latest loss reflects a pounds 3.8m
provision relating to the disposal and a pounds 5.9m operating loss on
continuing operations. Fairly priced.

The near-pounds 7m acquisition of Clan Asset Management, and of
Baronsmead for about pounds 3m in shares, helped increase funds under
management by pounds 340m. This and injections of investment capital
from two of I&S's institutions helped raise total funds under
management from pounds 3.1bn to pounds 3.7bn. After the pounds 700m
fall in funds in I&S's last full year it's heartening to see the
improved investment performance reflected in greater confidence from
existing clients. Coupled with cost-cutting, which reduced fees paid to
agents steering funds its way by pounds 1m, the gloom of the past year
is lifting. But the more stable base it seeks is another 12 months
away. And replacing lost clients is proving hard to do. Bell Lawrie
White expects full-year profits of pounds 6m, for a forward PE ratio of
18. High enough.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: HOBSON/HILLSDOWN - FOLLOW YOUR LEADER

Hillsdown Holdings' 31p per share cash offer should be enough for the
acquisitive conglomerate to snaffle up small food manufacturer Hobson.
The pounds 121m offer is recommended by Hobson's management. It seems
unlikely now that a third party will intervene.

The price looks fair, but not generous. And there must be a tinge of
disappointment amongst those who backed Hobson's audacious pounds 111m
acquisition of the Co-op's food distribution arm FE Barber in May 1994.

That deal was engineered by Hobson's (then) 28-year-old boss Andrew
Regan. FE Barber was worth five times more than Hobson at the time of
the deal and great things were expected from Mr Regan. Supporters say
he has done everything he promised. Three businesses have been sold,
others closed and overheads slashed. Brokers expect Hobson to make
profits of about pounds 17m in 1995 compared with Barber's pounds 10m
in 1993.

But rumoured deals with Geest and Albert Fisher never materialised. The
shares also remained stuck beneath the 27p price of the pounds 73m
rights issue that funded the Barber purchase.

Talks with Hillsdown apparently have been under way for some time. Mr
Regan's stake in Hobson is worth 'between pounds 2.5m and pounds 3m'.
His recommendation to jump ship now is probably a pretty good
indication that the really hard work still lies ahead. Follow his lead.
Accept.

Sir Ron Brierley's investment vehicle Guinness Peat has finally sold

slump in stock market volumes hit earnings in the first half of 1995.
Guinness Peat bought BSS for only pounds 5.6m two-and-a-half years ago
and since then has netted pounds 2.7m from the sale of its unit trust
and asset management businesses.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: FIRST HYDRO - FOURTH FORCE

There is a new force in UK electricity generation. US-based Mission
Energy is paying pounds 652.5m for First Hydro, the National Grid's
former pumped storage business. The bid beat others, including one from
Scottish Hydro-Electric. At the time of the National Grid flotation
last December First Hydro was valued at pounds 443m.

First Hydro operates two pumped storage stations in North Wales which
provide electricity in periods of peak demand. They pump water into a
reservoir at night and release it to generate power during the day. It
has 2,088MW of generating capacity and in the year to March 1995
profits rose from pounds 45.2m to pounds 74.7m.

Mission has the backing of its parent California-based SCECorp which is
worth nearly pounds 4bn. It already has investments in two gas-powered
generation stations in the UK and is one of four bidders in the running
for the 4,000MW generation capacity being sold by National Power. If it
is successful Mission will become the fourth-largest generator in the
UK and be a major competitor for National Power and PowerGen.

Regional electricity distributors will receive the cash in proportion
to their pre-flotation stakes in the National Grid. The windfall will
total pounds 680m.

NEW ISSUES: CLUBHAUS - WATCH THE BIRDIE

The chance of investing in golf clubs presents itself later this month.
Clubhaus, a golf club operator, is coming to the stock market via a
placing and open offer. Investors still have the chance to climb
aboard. They have until 26 January to buy shares in Ex-Lands, which is
demerging Clubhaus. In exchange for an existing Ex-Lands share, holders
will gain one new share in Ex-Lands plus one in Clubhaus. Dealings in
both new shares will start trading on 12 February.

Currently Ex-Lands' shares are changing hands at 20.5p, leaving some
scope for a first-day premium. Basic assets per share in Ex-Lands
according to the listing particulars is 26.8p.

Ex-Lands new shares should settle around 21.2p if its shares mirror
valuations of other property groups where the average discount to NAV
is around 20 per cent.

The new Clubhaus shares come virtually for free. Shareholders may wish
to top up holdings in this new company. A placing price around 7.5p is
expected. But doing so would inevitably expose investors to greater
risk. The placing should raise around pounds 5m. Even so Clubhaus will
still be nearly 90 per cent geared after taking account of Ex-Lands'
loans.

Clubhaus' golf clubs are mainly in Europe. Of its six clubs, three are
operational - Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart - but none were before
June 1994, so the trading record means little.

Former golf champion Jack Nicklaus designed the Hamburg and Brussels
courses. Golf is still in its infancy, relatively speaking, in Germany
and France.

Further expenditure of at least pounds 22.8m is planned, more than pro-
forma net assets post demerger. The other clubs, or clubs in waiting,
are at Vichy, Brussels and Duke's Dene near London.

Membership revenues come in large blocks, making it difficult to spot
any pattern of recurring fees. As such an investment in Clubhaus
remains speculative.

NEW ISSUES: FIRST MEDIA INVESTMENT TRUST - PLUGGING INTO MULTIMEDIA

Raphael Zorn Hemsley is launching an investment trust specialising in
the media sector. First Media Investment Trust will invest in both
listed and unlisted companies involved in the 'content' side of the
industry. This includes multimedia, computer games, TV broadcasters and
programme producers, music, radio and on-line services.

The trust intends to keep away from direct investment in hardware
makers, although its investments will, of course, use new hardware and
technology. Around 40 per cent of the fund will be invested in the US
with the rest being placed in the UK and Europe.

First Media plans to hold up to 30 per cent of its portfolio in
unlisted shares. The initial intention was to hold half of the assets
in unlisted investments but potential investors were happier with the
lower figure, at least for the time being. The trust will take stakes
of up to 49 per cent in these businesses which are likely to be based
in the UK or Europe. This is where it can really make its money by
getting in early in the life of a business. Much of the uplift in the
value of this kind of business can already have happened before the
shares are floated.

The key, of course, will be picking the right businesses and paying the
right price for a holding. John Scaife, who will be responsible for
identifying investments, has more than a decade of experience of media
investments in corporate finance roles and through his own media
consultancy. His experience should reduce the chances of the fund
making the wrong investment although the greater risk involved in
unlisted investment, especially start-ups and young companies, means
that not all investments will go as planned. First Media needs to make
sure that the successes outweigh any failures.

The aim is to raise up to pounds 100m via a placing at 100p per share -
there will be one warrant for every 10 shares. The minimum subscription
level is set at pounds 40m. The stock exchange has insisted that as the
investment manager, Raphael Zorn Hemsley cannot also be the trust's
sponsor. A sponsor is being sought and the placing should take place by
the end of January.

SMALLER COMPANIES: HARTONS' FLEXIBLE FRIEND

Hartons, the debt-laden Sheffield plastics distributor, has missed its
preference dividend for the last three years, is heavily exposed to the
building trade and, even after a refinancing, faces a long haul to
better trading. So why was its pounds 3m open offer over-subscribed?
The answer is that shareholders had the right to subscribe for all the
shares on offer. And Schuttersveld, the Dutch plastics group backing
Hartons' refinancing, did just that. But even after scaling back to
give other investors a chance, Schuttersveld ended up with 96 per cent
of the new shares. Suter, the industrial conglomerate which owns 30 per
cent of Hartons' preference shares and blocked Hartons' earlier attempt
at a refinancing, did not take up its rights. The result is that the
Dutch company, now with almost half the voting shares, has launched a
mandatory bid for Hartons at 8.5p for each ordinary share. It is
offering a measly 17.71p for each convertible preference share. That is
based on the existing conversion rights and makes no allowance for the
unpaid preference dividends. The offer document, still to go out, will
fill in the details. But even if ordinary shareholders grab their money
with thanks, preference shareholders will be slower to accept the bid.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ENNEMIX ON THE SLAB

Ennemix, the troubled Nottinghamshire aggregates group, is on the
shopping list of building materials giant Redland. The larger company
has bought a 29.99 per cent stake in Ennemix from venture capitalist
Nash Sells & Partners, one of the original shareholders, at 32p a
share. That is almost half the 63p placing price of September 1994 and
a third less than its 48p net asset value. Since flotation the company
has tripped up on acquisitions, seen former employees set up in
competition, faced an unfair dismissal claim from one of its senior
managers, and lost a key planning appeal. The growing dominance of the
big aggregates groups has also raised problems. But at the last count
Ennemix had about 14m tonnes of unconsented reserves. It has told
shareholders to sit tight, although the share price recovery to 36p
from its 20p doldrums must be tempting. Redland has yet to confirm
whether it will bid.

SMALLER COMPANIES: DOMESTIC BLISS

Shareholders in Residential Property Trust lobbed the company's
advisers a chunky cash Christmas present. Over 40 per cent, or pounds
500,000, of the pounds 1.4m raised by the property management company
in its December placing and open offer will go to the professional
advisers. The lucky few include merchant bank Hill Samuel, stockbroker
Credit Lyonnais, auditor Arthur Andersen and lawyer Morgan Bruce. The
cash will help pay for the pounds 2.75m acquisition of property
management company PKL. Finance director Chris Eales says: 'The costs
were certainly at the high end and obviously were something we tried to
lessen as much as possible. But in effect this was a reversal and means
a relisting of the shares. We were relaunching the company.' The shares
are suspended at 105p until the deal is done.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ENVIROMED STALKED?

EN plc is tightening its grip on healthcare group Enviromed. Associated
with former Enviromed director Ron Zwanziger, EN has recently increased
its interest to an 18 per cent stake. Mr Zwanziger is believed to be
acting in concert with other former Enviromed directors. Enviromed
chairman Sir Geoffrey Allen has had discussions with EN though its
intentions are still not clear. Enviromed, which suffered a pre-tax
loss of pounds 4.9m in the six months ended March, last month sold a
big chunk of its Cambridge Veterinary Sciences (CVS) business for
pounds 510,000. CVS was acquired for pounds 1.1m a year ago. Enviromed
retains CVS's fluoroimmunoassay technology, whose acquisition was a
principal reason for the original deal. Enviromed managing director Tom
Murphy wants the company to focus on diagnostics businesses in specific
areas.

SMALLER COMPANIES: NO AU REVOIR FOR LEP

Lep, the heavily indebted transport group, has gone. The shares,
suspended at 3p since June 1994, were cancelled on 29 December after
the company sold Lep International, its last business, to management.
Lep has been in trouble since the early 1990s. It fell into loss in
1991. Company doctor David James stepped in and an emergency rescue
plan left banks with 85 per cent of the company. But the remaining debt
still proved too much to handle.

SMALLER COMPANIES: OIS BID

OIS, the pipeline testing company fighting off an pounds 8.25m bid from
Abbot, the Scottish oil and gas drilling contractor, is likely to
publish its defence document today. OIS has rebuffed Abbot's overtures
on the grounds it fails to recognise OIS's market position, its skills
base and recovery in trading. Given OIS's poor track record, it's
likely to have an uphill battle to convince investors not to accept the
Abbot offer.

SMALLER COMPANIES: WATER HALL - DISSENTING VOICES

EDWARD Weiss, chairman of quarry services group Water Hall, is fighting
for his job. Fellow director Raschid Abdullah has called an EGM for 25
January to remove Mr Weiss and replace him with Anthony Smith, formerly
with Wagon Industrial. Given the chairman has a casting vote, Mr
Abdullah and Mr Smith could then effectively take control of Water
Hall's four-man board.

Mr Abdullah has fallen out with Mr Weiss and Water Hall's other
directors about the future direction of the company. Whereas Mr Weiss
would prefer to see Water Hall stick with its existing businesses, as
was the intention at the time of a rescue refinancing a year ago, Mr
Abdullah wants to turn it into a cash shell ahead of a move into the
industrial or distribution sectors.

The contest is likely to be close. Including the interests of his
brothers Ahmed and Osman, the latter was previously the company's chief
executive, Mr Abdullah already has the support of shareholders owning
10.37 per cent of the company. Arab investors control about 45 per cent
of the shares though it's unclear how these investors will vote.
Another potential stumbling block is that Water Hall is supposed to
roll over its banking facilities in about a fortnight. Whether bankers
are prepared to continue their support following a board share-up isn't
known.

SMALLER COMPANIES: MIGHTY WEETABIX

Despite the pressures on supermarket shelf space from own-label
cereals, fed in part by fierce price competition among the multiples,
full-year figures from Weetabix were excellent. Pre-tax profits rose a
tenth to pounds 31.3m on sales up a similar amount at pounds 240m.
Weetabix also had to contend with high world wheat prices and with a
proliferation of new products in the market. Despite continuing high
levels of advertising spend to support its range of brands, net cash
rose by pounds 8.8m over the year. Alpen increased its sales nicely
thanks to the introduction of Alpen Nutty Crunch, while Frosted Chex
and Honey Nut Chex, launched in 1994, have both achieved good
distribution. Overall, Weetabix is clearly managing to balance the
tricky equation between selling its own brands and having to supply
supermarkets with own-label products. Weetabix Limited was awarded the
Gold Medal of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors for 1995, a
credit to the company but also a reflection of just how hard it has to
work to keep profits moving forward. The businesses in North America
performed strongly; the investment programme there has led to a
considerable improvement in the gross margin. Until Ofex started, the
shares were traded under 4.2(a). A year ago they were at pounds 18.60,
so have done better than the market. Weetabix may not be able to buck
the pressure the own-label trend is putting on its brands indefinitely.
At pounds 26.25, high enough.

SMALLER COMPANIES: IRG'S MAIDEN BUY

Independent Radio Group, which raised pounds 10m in its Aim flotation
last October, has made its first acquisition and a further two deals
should be announced in the next month or so. It has spent pounds
920,000 on acquiring control of radio station Q96 FM, which is based in
Paisley, Scotland. When it mops up the minority interests, the total
cost will be around pounds 1.1m. Q96 FM plays 'classic hits' and is
currently losing a small amount of money. IRG sales director Neil Jones
says it is a case of getting the station's format right and then
'promoting it like mad'.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ONE-OFFS HIT NPC

Hot summer weather reduced demand for city-centre parking spaces
according to National Parking Corporation (NPC), the owner of National
Car Parks and Green Flag, the vehicle breakdown recoverer and repairer.
NPC is the largest company whose shares are traded on Ofex. The costs
of the increased borrowings taken on as a result of last year's 155p
special dividend also hit its figures for the 28 weeks to mid-October
1995. A change in accounting policy which means NPC now charges
depreciation on its buildings lopped another pounds 3.5m off profits.
Pre-tax profits slipped from pounds 27.4m to pounds 21m on turnover up
7 per cent to pounds 168m. Stripping out these costs, though, the
underlying performance of the businesses improved despite the summer
heatwave. Operating profits were 4 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period last year. England football team sponsor Green
Flag continues to rise. Recognition of the Green Flag name is growing
and the company intends to utilise this by launching new services under
this brand. NPC is a strong cash generator and this will enable it to
pay off the borrowings incurred to pay the special dividend. Following
the breakdown of buyout talks last year, NPC plans to obtain a full
listing in 1999. The shares are currently 465p valuing the company at
pounds 547m. About right.

JUST, the character licensing group traded on Ofex, expects 1996 to be
an exciting year. It hopes to announce some major deals and talks are
in progress with a number of big companies. At this stage, Just is coy
about releasing details.

About half of Just's sales are currently generated from its successful
In My Pocket range. It owns the rights to this range. Beginning with
Puppy In My Pocket in 1994, the concept has been extended to cover
Kitty, Pony and more recently Teddy In My Pocket figures. Over 60
million of these figures have been sold to British children, impressive
market penetration. Last month, it signed a new three-year deal with
toy maker Vivid Imaginations. Royalties from the deal could be worth
around pounds 2m. The In My Pocket range is also being expanded
internationally with distribution in 35 new territories this year. And
Just is considering the potential of an animation series.

In addition, Just acts on behalf of brand owners, licencing out rights
to third parties. Licences include BMG's The Wind in the Willows
Collection, Cadbury's parrot, Bertie Bassett and Jelly Babies. It also
handles corporate brand merchandising for Cadbury's, Raleigh and
Matchbox.

The next leg to Just's expansion could be funded by a mixture of debt
and equity. Alternatively it could consider joint ventures to ease its
shares of the financial burden. In 1995, it is likely to generate pre-
tax profits of about pounds 300,000 on turnover of pounds 2m, which
puts the shares on a PE ratio of less than 7.

Just is in the early stages of its development. The shares have
speculative appeal; good value.

ANALYSIS: POLYMASC'S MEDICAL SOAP OPERA

Polymasc Pharm'l - PEGylation technology developer

POLYMASC is a spin-off from London's Royal Free Hospital School of
Medicine. The medical school and the founding scientists, who own over
half the company, stand to become biotechnology millionaires if the
company's technologies, used to make it easier to treat conditions
ranging from kidney failure to cancer, reach their intended market.

The science boils down to a technique - called molecule altering
structural chemistry or MASC - for attaching a polymer, polyethylene
glycol (PEG), to some types of drug, specifically proteins, peptides
and liposomes. The PEG disguises the drugs from the body, allowing them
stay in the body longer. The result is happier patients because they
need lower doses and fewer injections.

The company argues that other types of PEGylation all have drawbacks.
So far the technique has watered down the benefit from the drug itself
or has needed a potentially toxic coupling agent to tie up the drug.
The gains from beating these problems and applying the result in
oncology, haematology, gene therapy and the treatment of genetic and
enzyme deficiencies make a compelling story.

But it will take time to develop. The first market will be in replacing
existing drugs with its own PEGylation technologies. Polymasc will not
disclose what it is developing, but it has three development contracts
under way. It does say that it has already applied its technologies to
two drugs - erythropoietin (Epo) and GM-CSF, used in treating anaemia
and white blood cell deficiency respectively.

Shares in Polymasc, placed at 100p, started trading at 127p just before
Christmas. Polymasc is using pounds 750,000 of the pounds 4.47m raised
in the placing to buy assets from the medical school. In theory,
Polymasc should have enough money to keep going until it hits breakeven
in 1997, but the risk remains that losses will continue for longer than
expected and the company will need to raise more money. One US company,
Enzon, already works in a similar field and Polymasc must show that its
technologies go one step further along. Even if all goes to plan, the
first products should only reach the market in 2001. But for investors
who understand the enormous risks of the biotechnology game and the
long wait for results, Polymasc is good value.

SMALLER COMPANIES: J&S STRENGTHENS

Abrasive machine tool designer and maker Jones & Shipman is building on
the recovery experienced in the second half of 1994-95. In the six
months ended September, it generated pre-tax profits of pounds 619,000
(pounds 897,000 loss) on sales up by nearly half to pounds 8.9m. J&S
generates more than three-fifths of sales overseas and reports strong
levels of business in North America, more than a quarter of group
sales, and France. But on a more cautious note, the company says there
has been a slowdown in the rate of growth in its order book in recent
months. That's hardly surprising given its strong rise over the last 12
months or so. And although November was a little disappointing,
December was J&S's best month in around seven years. House broker
Albert E Sharp is sticking with its full-year profits forecast of
pounds 1.3m. With the shares off the boil at 46p, the forward PE ratio
is 13 assuming a full tax charge. Good value.

SMALLER COMPANIES: TOTAL DISAPPOINTS

Life is proving difficult for software writer and supplier Total
Systems. In the six months ended September, it made a pounds 55,000
loss (pounds 7,000 profit). Sales rose 16 per cent to pounds 1.3m, a
smaller increase than Total would have liked. Another drag on profits
was investments Total has made in new software products. Just over a
third of sales go to the insurance market and chairman Terry Bourne
says Total has developed new software products in general insurance
systems that are 'state-of-the-art'. Even so, he complains of too much
resistance to change among information technology specialists. Total
hopes to return to the days when it was considered a high flyer. But
that won't happen in 1995-96 when it will be lucky to break even. At
21p, high enough.

There's been a bust-up at Quayle Munro after which co-founder Michael
Munro has left suddenly, leaving behind chief executive Ian Jones. The
company, though, has got steadily busier since March. That can be seen
in better second- half results for 1994-95 following a 10 per cent fall
in interim profits. Boosting this year's figures will be a gain on the
sale of shares in Parkside following its recent takeover by British
Polythene.

Last year Rangers won its seventh consecutive Scottish Premier League
Championship with an unbeaten run from November to January. That
success, coupled with capacity crowds at most home games, gave a big
boost to turnover and made up for an early exit from European
competition. Profits also benefited from a fall in the net cost of
players' registrations. But four recent transfer deals, including Paul
Gascoigne, suggest a return to losses this year.

Transense's non-contact torque sensors aim to make it economical to put
power steering into small cars with engines below 1,600 cc. But short
term the motor industry has switched to the cheaper hybrid technology,
electrohydraulic power steering, which may speed up the use of
Transense's sensors in the production of volume cars. It's produced a
number of EHPS prototypes and road tests have been completed on a
Renault Clio.

In April, Southern Vectis acquired a two-thirds interest in Vikoma, a
manufacturer of pollution-control equipment, for an initial pounds 2.5m
cash. It didn't contribute to profits last year but had a dramatic
effect on the balance sheet, where debtors soared from pounds 1.4m to
pounds 5.5m. That, and capital spending on buses, has pushed up gearing
significantly, although it could decline from now on.

Anglesey's new-look board is keen to reactivate mining on Parys
Mountain in north Anglesey. But first it has to agree a new share
structure, as its main shareholder, a Bermudan company, owns 29 per
cent of its shares and is also by far its largest creditor (for pounds
1.79m at end-March) - fees due to professional advisers come next.
Parys Mountain has been mined since Roman times and has significant
reserves of base metals.

The pounds 499,000 exceptional cost (pounds 200,000 over budget) of
reorganising its sweets division put a brake on Armour's profits in
1994-95. At the same time both air fresheners and the new Bluecol car

The jump in sales and increased house completions from 172 to 292 shows
how hard Bellwinch tried to increase profits in 1994-95. But weak
demand and margins squeezed by higher land costs and rising raw
material prices largely thwarted it and led to results much below early
1995 expectations. Bellwinch reports a poor first quarter this year.

Services for Industry, for pounds 8.2m in shares. That deal reduces the
company's 80 per cent reliance on motor industry customers and
increases market share for manufacturing and distribution software. On

Greenspan Sneezes, IPO's Catch Cold

Once again the Federal Reserve is proving it writes the script for Wall Street.
In a Thursday night speech to the American Enterprise Institute, Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan sent warnings that stock prices could be overvalued and the Feds
might take steps to cool the market off. The words weren't lost on anybody.
Money managers don't sell in the face of soaring stock prices, and all were
looking for a reason to run for the exits. The Fed Chairman has just given them
their excuse, sparking the fuse worldwide for investors to cash out and take
profits.

The choppy waters of the IPO market swam in a different undercurrent this past
week. What got priced were several small-cap issues underwritten by
little-known investment bank whose names are difficult to find in Wall Street's
directories. Not too surprising, given small underwriters' historically proven
ability to push small deals, the aftermarket performance was spectacular.

Such underwriters as Coburn & Meredith and Werbel-Roth led the way as Wall
Street's giants stepped to the sidelines. Nine IPOs were priced from Friday,
November 29 to Thursday, December 5, and seven were winners. There were no
losers and the two IPOs that were unchanged (see Launching Pad - page 2) were
underwritten by the well know and respected Oppenheimer & Co.

The biggest moonshot of the week came from the syndicate desks of Werbel-Roth
and co-manager Millennium Securities. On Tuesday, the underwriters offered
700,000 shares of Translation Group (NASDAQ:THEO), a deal that had been on the
IPO calendar for several weeks, at $6 a share and 1.3 million warrants at $0.20
a warrant. The first day's trading was curious. The stock opened at $7 and then
exploded to the day's high and closing price of $14, up 133%. The warrants
followed a similar path in opening at $1, then zooming to $7.25 before closing
at $6, up 2,900%. And the company? It is located in Pennsauken, N.J., and is
engaged in the translation of documents and software.

On December 5, Coburn & Meredith with its co-manager, Shamrock Partners, priced
1.0 million shares and warrants of Websecure (NASDAQ:WEBS and WEBSW,
respectively) at $8 a share and $0.20 a warrant. Both soared. The common stock
opened at $14.50 share, traded between a range of $15.25 and $12.50, and closed
at $14.75, up 84.4%. The warrants opened at $4, sold low at $3 and closed on
their high of $5.88, up 2,837.5%. The development-stage company, based in
Saugus, Mass., offers Internet access and support services for secure
commercial transactions.

In a not-too-shabby third place finish was the Advanced Aerodynamics &
Structures (NASDAQ:AASIU) offering of DH Blair. On Thursday, 6.0 million units
consisting of one common share, one class A warrant and one class B warrant
were priced at $5 a unit. The securities were traded three ways: as units, as
common stock and as warrants. The units opened at $7.75, sold to a high of
$9.50 and closed at $8.50, up a nifty 70%. The company, located in Long Beach,
Calif., is engaged in the design and manufacture of prop and jet aircraft.

Normally, when a hot IPO market become dominated by the small fries, it is a
sign of a top. However, the new issue market is not frothy. Despite the
record-setting volume figures this year, the IPO market is far from sizzling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average have soared over 25% this year to a November
top of 6,547 while the new issue market (see ranking charts page 13) squeaked
out a modest gain of 13.6% in the 12 months ending November 29.

Now that the Fed has spoken and profit taking hit the market, a new and
stronger securities market will emerge. It always has, and the Fed Chairman
doesn't want to go down in history as the father of another 1929-type stock
market crash that led to the Depression of the 1930s. The stock market is here
to stay, and so are IPOs.John E.Fitzgibbon,Jr.

Oakmont Flue Shut As Shapiro Delivers

Mary Shapiro, regulations president of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, began handing early Christmas presents last week.

Her first stop, Lake Success, N.Y., where she left bad brokerage firm Stratton
Oakmont a lump of coal and an expulsion from the securities industry.

Over the past seven years, Stratton Oakmont has been repeatedly disciplined,
fined, sued and reprimanded by securities regulators and customers.

Charges to the company have included excessive mark-ups on stock offerings,
illicit sales practices, fraud and business ethics abuses.

An unaudited accounting of the total amount of fines owed by the firm could
exceed $25 million, sources familiar with the situation said.

This latest action centers on allegations that the firm instituted essesively
large mark-ups in the securities of pink-sheeted Master Glazier's Karate
International, and charged buyers over and above standard transaction costs to
do trades.

Besides closing the firm's doors, at least for the holidays, the expulsion
specifically bars Stratton's president Daniel Porush and Steven Saunders, its
head trader, from any securities dealings.

Neither Porush or Saunders could be reached for comment at presstime.

The expulsion also affects the trading of two initial public offerings that the
firm managed to underwrite this year and the proposed launch of one other.

In January Stratton Oakmont, offered stock and warrants totaling $10.15 million
in proceeds for Paramount Financial (NASDAQ:PARA) at $3.50 per unit. At press
time the shares closed at $1 on a volume of 82. The warrants, trading
separately, closed at 7/32 on volume of 105. Paramount is a consumer and
business financial services firm.

In May, the firm offered stock and warrants totaling $6.5 million in proceeds
for n-Vision (NASDAQ:NVSN) at $5 per unit. At press time the stock closed at 1
5/16 and the warrants at 3/8.

n-Vision makes and markets proprietary virtual reality applications for a
variety of applications including medicine, simulation, and industrial design

Trading, such as it is, in these stocks will continue through clearing agent
J.B. Oxford., which has had no charges leveled against it

Another proposed issue has been filed with SEC but has been in a state of
perpetual postponement, which now is more unlikely than ever to be lifted.

In April, e-Net, an Internet service provider, filed for an IPO calculated to
generate $14 million in proceeds. Based in Gaithersburg, Md., e-Net executives
did not return telephone calls.

Inside sources at the NASD say that the move against Stratton Oakmont is

Shapiro's first significant crackdown on brokerage abuses since she took office
earlier this year. More are expected.

12-Month Rankings Have Bear Tracks

Bear, Stearns (NYSE:BSC) is hoping the underwriting of First Virtual Holdings
(Proposed NASDAQ:FVHI) this week performs as well as the 14 other deals the
firm has done over the 12 months ended November 30.

According to statistics from Securities Data Co., Bear, Stearns is the number
one manager of positive performing initial public offerings during the rolling
12-months began in December 1995.

During the period, Bear, Stearns brought a total of 14 IPOs to market. As of
the close on Nov. 29, they averaged a hefty 49.9% increase over their offer
prices. This compares impressively to the mediocre 16.91% average increase
notched by all IPOs priced in the time frame.

No doubt the success of several high profile issues, such as Planet Hollywood
(NASDAQ:PHII), Guangshen Railway (NYSE:GSH), Sabratek (NASDAQ:SBTK) and Suiza
Foods (NASDAQ:SWZA) helped lift Bear, Stearns from fifth place in the October
to October rankings ran last month to first place for the 12 months ended
November 30.

In New York, staffers at Planet Hollywood are still cordoning off the sidewalk
for tourists to gape at the  film industry's eatery/media memorabilia shop.

Offered at $18 ($2 above the high end of the filing range), PHII has closed as
high as $32.125 since its April IPO. The Class A shares posted a recent close
of $23.

Guangshen, China's in-country railroad, offered more than 11 million American
Depository Shares at $19 in May. The ADSs  hit an all-time high of $21.50, and
landed a recent close near offer price of $19.75. Not great, but tight and
consistent.

Sabratek, the electromedical equipment manufacturer, came to market in June at
$10. The IPO price was $1 below the original $11 to $13 filing range, and yet
investors snapped up the all 2.5 million shares and have booted the share price
as high as $16.75. A recent close lists the shares about $2 off that high but
still $4 above the offer price.

Suiza, the Puerto Rican milk products and fruit drinks producer, was offered at
$14 (smack dab in the middle of its filing range) posted a recent close of
$18.625. That isn't far from its all-time high of $19.25.

Price spreads among these issues may be tight compared to some other issues
offered this year, but, as one BSC staffer said, "they're tight but they're
right for the market."

Indeed, the IPO Managers Aftermarket chart shows on average, BSC has priced its
IPOs more than 3 1/2% below the stated filing range, only to have the shares
soar nearly 10% at the end of their first day of trading.

Unlike number three ranked Hambrecht & Quist (NYSE:HMQ), BSC has stayed away
from any industry-based underwriting niche.

Where Hambrecht has carved out a solid place among technology issues, BSC's
equity participations are an eclectic mix of transportation, food, and even
consumer financial services such as United Payors & United Providers
(NASDAQ:UPUP). Offered in July at $11, the shares have been as high as $15,
although a recent close of $12 has wiped out those gains.

The "one from column A and one from column B" approach is classic conservatism
for investors. It is also vintage Bear among deal makers on Wall Street.

BSC's, mix of industry sectors has allowed it to take advantage of the stars in
a range of niches.

As the IPO Industry Aftermarket chart shows, credit institutions have turned in
a surprising 73% increase over offer price.

BSC managed the underwriting of RAC Financial Group  (NASDAQ:RACF) in February
at $17. While the shares have dipped as low as $8.75, they have also been as
high as $30.75, with a recent close of $23.125.

Again, issues in this sector have been priced an average 4 1/2% below the
stated filing range, but closed the first day of trading up more than 14%.

For individual investors, the scenario where an issue comes to market cheaper
that expected and then spirals higher than could have been hoped for is better
than the converse.

Consider specialty investors of application  software products over the last 12
months.

With their sexy Internet intros and promises to make life on the PC easier and
more exciting, these issues come to market priced at a premium.

According to Securities Data, software applications that target home users have
been priced on a steep average of 15% higher than the stated filing range.

While there is heavy, almost too-good-to-be-true activity for about a month
after offer, these stock have settled at or below offer price and show no
tangible sign of returning  to former short-lived glory.

Volatility in this sector is not only a matter of broken promises. A quick and
informal pol of industry analysts reveals that a good story might get some
venture capitalists interested, but for long-term investors the company has to
have a product that has the potential to become an industry standard.

"As computer usage becomes more commonplace among individuals," said one
analyst. "Users are finding out that they do not have to have ever single new
software package that comes out, as soon as it comes out."

The same quick rise and quicker fall is true for software applications that
target business customers (see chart).

"These issues don't represent the games or a lot of the educational mark," said
one industry analyst. "They do represent a lot of the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
wannabe's who ultimately can't compete with the established leaders in
spreadsheet, word processing, etc. . Unfortunately, the market is a bit
gullible about what a company or product promises it can do." By Gracian Mack

* Many institutions have creative names for these accounts, i.e.,
statement savings, performance fund, liquid asset savings, and so on.
There often are "tiers" whereby a higher yield will be paid on
progressively higher balances.  Finally, it is important to point out
that these are federally insured bank offered accounts, and are not to
be confused with "money funds," which are broker issued mutual funds
and NOT federally insured.  The top money funds (taxable and tax free)
for the week can be found by selecting item 4 on RateGram's main menu.

SEC Proposes New Disclosures
About Derivatives

The SEC has proposed for comment amendments to require disclosure
of the accounting policies used for derivatives (Rel. Nos. 33-7250,
34-36643, IC-21625, December 28, 1995).  Comment also is sought on
proposed amendments to require qualitative and quantitative
disclosure outside the financial statements about the market risk
associated with derivatives.

The SEC conducted a review of about 500 registrants in 1994 and
1995 to assess disclosure practices with respect to market risk
sensitive instruments.  The disclosures reviewed in 1995 were more
informative than 1994, largely due to improved guidance by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the staff concluded.
However, three significant disclosure issues remain.   The release
addresses those issues.

The proposed amendments would require enhanced descriptions in the
footnotes to financial statements of accounting policies used for
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity
instruments.  The materiality of such disclosure would be
determined by the fair values of the instruments at the end of each
reporting period and during each reporting period.

The SEC proposed a new Item 305 under Regulation S-K to require
disclosure outside the financial statements of qualitative and
quantitative information about derivatives and other financial
instruments.  In complying with the proposed amendments requiring
disclosure of quantitative information about market risk,
registrants could select from three alternatives.  One option is to
use a tabular presentation of expected future cash flow amounts and
related contract terms categorized by expected maturity dates.

A second option is to use a sensitivity analysis expressing the
possible loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market
risk sensitive instruments from selected hypothetical changes in
market rates and prices.  The final option is to use value at risk
disclosures expressing the potential loss in earnings, fair values,
or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from market
movements over a selected period of time with a selected likelihood
of occurrence.

The proposed qualitative information about market risk would
include a narrative discussion of primary market risk exposures and
how they are managed.  Registrants are reminded to include
information about derivatives that directly or indirectly affect
reported items to the extent such information is material and
necessary to prevent the disclosure about a reported item from
being misleading.

The SEC reported its intention that forward looking disclosures
under new Item 305 and Item 9A of Form 20-F be subject to an
appropriate safe harbor.  The staff is considering how to craft an
appropriate safe harbor in light of the recently passed Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act.  The Act amends the 1933 and 1934
Acts to include a safe harbor for forward looking information.  The
SEC will issue a release in the near future to propose that dis-
closures to be required by Items 305 and 9A be made subject to safe
harbor provisions.

The SEC noted that it recognizes the evolving nature of market risk
sensitive instruments and will continue to monitor disclosure
related issues.  If the proposals are adopted, the SEC expects to
reconsider the effectiveness of the rules and the need for
additional proposals in about five years.  The comment period for
the proposed amendments is 120 days.

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS

JAMES MCCURRY, FORMER COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND OPERATIONS MANAGER
OF BIEDENHARN INVESTMENT GROUP, INC., BARRED

On December 29 the Commission issued an Order Instituting
Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
against James McCurry (McCurry), formerly the compliance officer
and operations manager of Biedenharn Investment Group, Inc.
(Biedenharn), a now defunct broker-dealer formerly registered
with the Commission.  McCurry consented to the entry of the
Order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings,
except the entry of a permanent injunction against him which was
admitted.

The Order makes findings that McCurry participated in the offer
and sale to investors of over $36 million of note securities
issued by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial
Corporation (Towers) by means of a general public solicitation
through mailings of form letters, which made materially
misleading statements to investors concerning the relative
safety of an investment in Towers notes; the risks associated
with the investment; the ratings on the securities offered by
Towers; and the collateralization for and/or insurance for the
Towers obligations.  The Order makes further findings that
McCurry was permanently enjoined by consent in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (Shreveport
Division, SEC v. James McCurry and William E. Powdrill, III)
from violations of the securities registration and antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the
offer and sale of note securities offered and issued by Towers.
The Order bars McCurry from association with any broker, dealer,
investment adviser, investment company or municipal securities
dealer.  (Rel. 34-36654)

WILLIAM POWDRILL, FORMER REGISTERED SALES REPRESENTATIVE OF
BIEDENHARN INVESTMENT GROUP, INC., BARRED

On December 29 the Commission issued an Order Instituting
Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
against William E.  Powdrill, III (Powdrill), formerly a
registered sales representative of Biedenharn Investment Group,
Inc. (Biedenharn), a now defunct broker-dealer formerly
registered with the Commission.  Powdrill consented to the entry
of the Order without admitting or denying the Commission's
findings, except the entry of a permanent injunction against him
which was admitted.

The Order makes findings that McCurry participated in the offer
and sale to investors of over $36 million of note securities
issued by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial
Corporation (Towers) by means of a general public solicitation
through mailings of form letters, which made materially
misleading statements to investors concerning the relative
safety of an investment in Towers notes; the risks associated
with the investment; the ratings on the securities offered by
Towers; and the collateralization for and/or insurance for the
Towers obligations.  The Order makes further findings that
McCurry was permanently enjoined by consent in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (Shreveport
Division, SEC v. James McCurry and William E. Powdrill, III)
from violations of the securities registration and antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the
offer and sale of note securities offered and issued by Towers.
The Order bars Powdrill from association with any broker,
dealer, investment adviser, investment company or municipal
securities dealer.  (Rel. 34-36655)

EDWARD DUFFY AND MICHAEL KARP SANCTIONED FOR ROLES IN SARIVOLA
FRAUD

The Commission announced the institution and settlement of
administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Rules
of practice against Edward F. Duffy and Michael N. Karp.  Duffy
and Karp were previously named as defendants in SEC v. Anthony
Sarivola, et al., a civil injunctive action filed by the
Commission on October 31, 1995 in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York.  The Commission's complaint
alleged that Duffy and Karp participated in a fraudulent scheme
masterminded by Anthony Sarivola while they served as counsel
for and directors of certain companies controlled by Sarivola.
On November 17, 1995, the court permanently enjoined Duffy and
Karp, on consent, from future violations of certain antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws.

Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Duffy
consented to be permanently denied the privilege of appearing or
practicing before the Commission, and Karp consented to be
denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the
Commission with a right to apply to resume appearing or
practicing after two years.  (Rel. 34-36664)

FINAL JUDGMENT OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED AGAINST JAMES
MCCURRY AND WILLIAM POWDRILL

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the entry
of Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction on December 19, 1995
in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana
against James McCurry (McCurry) and William E. Powdrill, III
(Powdrill) which permanently enjoined Powdrill and McCurry from
violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the
federal securities laws.  Based upon the defendants' inability
to pay, disgorgement and prejudgment interest was waived as to
Powdrill and civil penalties were not imposed against either
defendant.  McCurry and Powdrill consented to the entry of the
Final Judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in
the Commission's complaint.

The Commission alleged that McCurry and Powdrill violated the
antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal
securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, from
at least April 1988 until September 1992, McCurry and Powdrill
raised $12.8 million through the offer and sale of notes issued
by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial Corporation
(Towers), of which $5.2 million subsequently defaulted.  The
Commission also alleged that McCurry and Powdrill misrepresented
the safety of the notes, which were speculative and subject to
numerous risks and that they falsely claimed that certain of the
notes were covered by insurance or were fully collateralized.

In a related action on February 8, 1993, the Commission filed a
civil action against Towers and certain of its principals
alleging antifraud and registration violations of the federal
securities laws.  See LR-13514.  [SEC v. James McCurry and
William E. Powdrill, III, USDC/WD, LA/Shreveport Div, Civil
Action No. CA-95-0552-S] (LR-14768)

DAVID SCHWARTZ SETTLES INSIDER TRADING CASE CONCERNING
SECURITIES OF DESOTO, INC.

The Commission announced today that the Honorable John G. Koeltl
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York signed a final judgment against defendant David P.
Schwartz permanently enjoining him from future violations of
Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
14e-3 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $3,063.83 in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and $14,833.00 as a civil
penalty under the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud
Enforcement Act of 1988.  The judgment was entered on December
14, 1995.  Defendant Schwartz consented to the entry of the
final judgment without admitting of denying the allegations in
the complaint.

In this action the Commission alleges that on November 9, 1989,
while in possession of material, nonpublic information relating
to the tender offer for DeSoto, Inc. announced later that day,
defendant Schwartz, at the time an employee of Morgan Stanley &
Co. Inc., tipped defendant Edward A. Cantor, who then purchased
35,000 shares of DeSoto, Inc. for a total cost of about
$1,443,750.  Defendant Cantor previously settled with the
Commission without admitting or denying the allegations.

Disgorgement and prejudgment interest paid by defendants Cantor
and Schwartz is being held by the Court for the benefit of
persons who submit valid claims within one year after the date
of entry of the final judgments.  The Commission intends to
petition the Court to appoint a special claims master to develop
a distribution plan.  The litigation is pending against
defendant Michael Levine.  For further information, see LR-14329
(November 9, 1994) and LR-14678 (October 4, 1995).  [SEC v.
Cantor, et al., 94 Civ. 8079,JGK, U.S.D.C. S.D.N.Y.  filed
November 8, 1994] (LR-14769)

Balancing The Deal

By Frederic Rubinstein, Kelley Drye & Warren, 
New York, NY; and Marc Morgenstern, 
Kahn Kleinman et al., Cleveland, OH
Business Law Today
November/December 1995, Pgs. 26-31

Overview:  Airs the unavoidable tension between the private placement issuer
and the investors it hopes to attract.  Highlights alternatives in structuring
private placements, which balance investors' risk/reward incentives and the
company's managerial concerns.

Choose financing vehicle.  The first issue a company must consider when
structuring a private placement is whether to sell debt or equity.  Proceeds
of an equity offering increase the company's net worth, thereby improving its
borrowing capacity and ov erall financial strength.  Although debt expands the
company's capital base, it does not increase the net worth and it must be
repaid.  Debt subordinated to the company's primary lending institution may be
viewed as equity by the lender (i.e., to satisfy the lender's
debt-to-equity-ratio requirements), but trade creditors may not share that
view.  While interest accruing on debt is booked as an expense, thereby
increasing liabilities and decreasing profit and net worth, accrued but unpaid
dividends on equity securities do not reduce income and have no impact on net
worth until paid.

Ascertain investors' goals.  To ensure liquidity for their investment,
investors in a private placement need an exit strategy.  As compensation for
the increased risk and longer holding periods of a private placement,
investors generally seek a high rate of return (an anticipated compounded
internal rate of 30 to 45 percent) as well as the ability to maximize their
probability of achieving a return of capital.  Therefore the investment is
often structured as preferred stock, convertible debt, or subordinated debt
with an equity feature.  To maintain control over their investment, private
placement investors often negotiate seats on or control of the company's board
of directors, limits on executive compensation, antidilution provisions, and
the ability to control certain transactions outside of the ordinary course of
business.

Consider the alternatives.  Before purchasing preferred stock, investors
should focus on the following negotiable features:  a liquidation preference;
a dividend preference, preferably cumulative; a conversion right into common
stock; a forced redemption feature; voting rights equal to the number of
common shares into which the preferred stock can convert; demand or piggyback
registration rights; a right of first refusal allowing pro rata participation
in any future offering; a "come-along" right to ensure the preferred investor
receives whatever the inside stockholders get for their shares; a "take-along"
that forces the inside shareholders to go along if the investor wants to sell
the entire company; and negative covenants restricting actions that diminish
the preferred stock's value without the investor's consent.

Compare rates of return.  The form of the security issued in a private
placement can have a dramatic effect on the investor's return, should the
company fall short of its stated performance goals or greatly exceed them.
For example, an investor purchasing $100,000 of common stock that represents
one-third of the company would receive $83,333 if the company were sold five
years later for $250,000 - a loss of $16,333.  On the other hand, an investor
purchasing 8 percent cumulative convertible preferred stock with a $100,000
liquidation preference, convertible into one-third of the company's common
stock, would receive $140,000 ($40,000 of accumulated dividends and the
$100,000 liquidation preference) if the company were sold five years later for
$250,000 - a gain of $40,000.

Going Public: Implications For The Question Of Minimizing 
Discrimination In The Residential Real Estate Industry

By Richard Bennett
Capcar Enterprises, Ltd., Bermuda
Real Estate Law Journal
Vol. 24, No. 2, Pgs. 122-145

Overview:  Describes several ways by which real estate developers can raise
equity.  Worries that the securities laws may not deter developers from
discriminating when making construction decisions.  Discouraging
discrimination.  If funding comes from a federally insured or funded
institution, such as a bank, developers cannot use it for discriminatory
purposes and the lender retains an interest in and control over the use of
funds.  Federal antidiscrimination laws do not, however, apply to funds raised
in the equity markets.  The shareholders, through the market, exercise control
by selling, which drives down the stock price.  Therefore, equity-funded
developers may feel pressured to focus on the bottom line and build only
higher-cost housing.  Although the SEC scrutinizes the financial disclosures
of a public company, it does not prohibit these discriminatory building
practices.

The MBS dilemma.  Real estate developers are increasingly accessing the
securities markets - through MBSs and REITs - rather than seeking traditional
bank loans to provide their working capital.  Mortgage-backed securities are
instruments that bundle mortgages together and create a security backed by the
cash flow from the mortgage payments.  A notable problem is the unevenness of
the cash flow.  Similar to bonds with a call feature, the underlying mortgages
may be (and often are) prepaid when interest rates fall, but investors cannot
ascertain the exact conditions that will prompt prepayment and cannot plan for
its occurrence.  Investors might value the MBS investment higher if they had
detailed disclosures about the underlying mortgages, including information
about the borrowers.  Unfortunately, the same information that would allow
them to calculate the probabilities of prepayment would also permit
discrimination against certain borrowers and certain neighborhoods.

With few strings attached.  Many developers use a real estate investment trust
to issue stock.  To qualify as a REIT, the trust cannot be closely held and
must attract at least 100 investors.  The REIT must derive its income from and
hold its assets only in defined areas, and it must pay a preset dividend.  A
typical REIT provides large amounts of cash to the developer, with few strings
attached.  The REIT's main advantage is that it is not subject to federal
income tax for the portion of its capital gains distributed to shareholders,
thus avoiding the double taxation of the corporate form.  The developer that
finances solely with debt runs a constant risk of financial difficulty; adding
REIT equity decreases the risk and may increase the developer's value.

Developers' decisionmaking.  Equity funding ideally would free a developer to
make decisions based purely on economics.  Theoretically the developer's ideal
portfolio contains a mixture of high, moderate, and low-income housing.
Affordable housing stock provides a steady stream of rental income, which will
look good on quarterly disclosure statements, ensures working capital, and
allows for the payment of regular dividends.  The fear is that developers
might not make decisions based purely on economic considerations, but rather
may shun low-income housing that does not increase profits for public
shareholders.  A statutory gap exists, one that allows developers to
discriminate when building residential housing.  The government should fill
this vacuum by extending the reach of the fair-housing laws to cover the gap
or adding new features to the securities laws.

How To Draft Financial Representations And Indemnity Provisions 
In Acquisition Agreements

By Leigh Walton
Bass Berry & Sims, Nashville, TN
ALI-ABA Course Materials Journal
Vol. 20, No. 2, Pgs. 39-48

Overview:  Outlines the representations of financial condition and the
indemnification clauses commonly used in acquisition agreements, including
draft model provisions prepared by an ABA committee.  Provides guidelines for
negotiating and drafting them.  Contrasts the arguments each side might use in
negotiations.  Basic representations.  The seller's representations about its
financial condition are critical elements in an acquisition agreement.
Representations are generally based on financial statements.  As early in the
process as possible, a buyer should review the audit report to see if the
seller's financial statements conform to GAAP.  Sellers are wise to represent
only that the financials "fairly present" the company's financial condition
"in accordance with GAAP" and not that they are "complete and correct."  A
seller's representation that interim financials conform to GAAP should include
proper qualifications, for example, that they are subject to "normal recurring
year-end adjustments."  In turn, the purchaser should require a further
representation that the effect of any qualifications will not "individually or
in the aggregate, be materially adverse."

Tailoring representations.  Sellers can resist or modify a buyer's requests
for additional financial representations.  A common request is a
representation that the target's records are complete, correct, and in
conformance with valid business practice.  The seller may respond that GAAP
financials alone are sufficient; however, if it does agree to give that
representation, it should add a materiality qualification.  Frequently buyers
request representations on specific line items in financial statements,
perhaps to avoid the seller's qualifications (such as materiality).  For
example, the buyer may seek assurance that the accounts receivable are
collectible.  The seller should object because doing so would constitute
giving a guarantee.  Other common line item representations involve inventory
and undisclosed liabilities.

Carving out indemnification.  Multiple sellers might agree on
joint-and-several liability, with or without an allocation agreement.
Alternatively, each seller's degree of liability could depend on its
proportionate share of the sale price, its role in the business (i.e., active
or passive), or the specific representation or covenant involved.  A seller
should indemnify beyond the representations' scope only on a known problem for
which a clean representation seems impossible.  Careful drafting can resolve
in advance any questions of whether tax benefits, insurance proceeds, and
found assets will offset losses.  Any clause setting an indemnification
deductible should indicate whether reaching it entitles the purchaser to every
dollar of loss or only every dollar over the deductible.  Parties should also
clarify how the clause intersects with materiality limitations in specific
representations.  A buyer should not consent to the seller's typical request
for an indemnification maximum equal to the purchase price unless it can carve
out appropriate exceptions (e.g., taxes and intentional conduct, such as
fraud).

Ancillary aspects of indemnity.  Sellers should not agree to indemnify against
breaches of representations and covenants from documents other than the
acquisition agreement and its schedules.  A buyer concerned about the seller's
creditworthiness could negotiate an escrow as a nonexclusive remedy, a letter
of credit, or a right of set-off against postclosing payments it owes the
seller.  An indemnification's time limit depends on the nature of the business
and the sufficiency of the financial statements provided, but the buyer should
demand at least enough time for one postclosing audit.  A seller should insist
that the indemnity is the exclusive means of asserting claims; in turn, the
buyer should demand that any exclusivity clause apply only to money damages.
Because this clause would not bar recourse under Rule 10b-5 (or other fraud
laws), a seller could counter the scienter element of a possible 10b-5 claim
by documenting the buyer's opportunity to perform due diligence.

An Argument For Invalidating Change Of Control Covenants

By Thomas Marko
University of Iowa College of Law
Journal of Corporation Law
Vol. 20, No. 3, Pgs. 475-496

Overview:  Analyzes change-of-control debt covenants, focusing on their
defensive use as a tactic to entrench current management.  Argues that these
covenants fail to satisfy the test for determining the validity of management
defensive tactics and therefore are illegal.

Protection or defense.  Courts traditionally refuse to recognize a fiduciary
relationship between management and bondholders and are generally unwilling to
find a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under
bond contracts.  Accordingly, bondholders often require bond instruments to
include a change-of-control covenant, which typically will give the bondholder
the right to put the bond back to the company or receive a higher interest
rate, should a designated takeover-related event occur.  The
change-of-con-trol covenant is usually triggered by a hostile attempt such as
a tender offer or successful proxy contest.  Because the triggers apply only
to transactions not approved by management and do not necessarily take into
account whether bond values will be adversely affected by the change of
control, these covenants are used most often by incumbent management as a
defensive entrenchment tool.

Unocal test applies.  The Delaware Supreme Court in Unocal Corp.  v.  Mesa
Petroleum Co.  established a two-pronged inquiry for determining the validity
of management defensive tactics:  1) the directors must have reasonable
grounds to believe that another entity's ownership would pose a danger to
corporate policy and effectiveness; and 2) the defensive measure is reasonable
in relation to the purported threat.  Although it has never been judicially
applied to determine the validity of change-of-control covenants in bond
instruments, the Unocal test seems the appropriate standard to apply.

Threatening corporate policy.  Delaware courts assessing management's
responses to hostile tender offers have recognized three potential threats to
corporate policy and effectiveness:  (i) opportunity loss (the tender offer
may deprive shareholders of the opportunity to select a better alternative);
(ii) structural coercion (the risk that fear of disparate treatment of
shareholders not accepting the tender offer may affect shareholders'
decisionmaking); and (iii) substantive coercion (the risk that shareholders
who disbelieve management's good-faith predictions about future value may be
led to accept the tender offer).  A change-of-control bond covenant triggered
by a hostile tender offer survives the first prong of the Unocal test.
However, only a proxy contest joined with a tender offer presents a legitimate
risk to shareholder interests.  Thus, a change-of-control bond covenant
triggered by a proxy contest alone would not survive the first Unocal prong.

Matching remedy to threat.  Even if a change-of-control covenant could survive
the first prong, the second prong requires that the covenant must be
reasonable in relation to the alleged threat.  By giving bondholders a put or
an increased interest rate, a change-of-control covenant benefits only the
bondholders and not the shareholders, who would be deprived of the opportunity
to choose between competing offers.  In proxy contests, dissidents would find
it much more difficult convincing shareholders to vote in their favor.  Thus,
a change-of-control bond covenant triggered by either a hostile tender offer
or a proxy contest fails the second prong of the Unocal test and should be
invalidated.

Dealing With State Securities Regulators

By Michael Missal, Stephen Topetzes, and Marc Bryant
Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, Washington, DC
Review of Securities & Commodities Regulation
Vol. 28, No. 20, Pgs. 203-213

Overview:  Explores recent trends in state securities law enforcement.
Explains the scope of state enforcement, focusing on actions against
securities professionals.  Contrasts state and federal powers and
investigative strategies, and suggests response tactics for targets.

State enforcement.  State securities regulators possess a wide panoply of
enforcement powers and remedies (including several not available to or used by
the SEC).  They often issue cease-and-desist orders in settling disputed
antifraud cases or other alleged registration infractions.  Most states permit
public (as well as discreet or secretive) investigation of securities
violations.  This public process can seriously injure a securities firm's
reputation, even absent any eventual finding of wrongdoing.  Because state
agencies have small staffs and frequent personnel turnover, they often resort
to processes that are informal, not fully documented, and not procedurally
safeguarded (compared with SEC investigations).

Collateral damage and coordinated enforcement.  State regulators often issue
stop orders revoking the effectiveness of registration statements they find
misleading or otherwise in violation of the registration or prospectus
requirements.  Given the cooperation between regulators in multiple states and
the nearly universal presence of "bad boy" provisions in blue sky laws,
sanctions in one state will generate sanctions in other states for a
multistate offering or one involving a regional or national securities firm.
Counsel for regulatory targets must therefore be sensitive to collateral
consequences when attempting to settle proceedings in the initial state and
are wise to maintain a more national viewpoint and strategy.

Strategize to prevent runaway liability.  When defending or settling state
enforcement actions, counsel should attempt as soon as possible to establish
cordial, cooperative relations with the regulators, who often serve
simultaneously as investigator, prosecutor, judge, and executioner.  During
the informal period, counsel should push to create ground rules for producing
documents and exchanging information, while keeping other states' regulators
at bay pending resolution of the initial action.  Losing in the "court of
public opinion" before succeeding with a legal defense can be a costly error.
The issuer should develop a broad-scale plan for making whatever corrective
action might be necessary in multiple states.  Because of the state agency's
high public profile, the regulators often demand that settlements include
restitution and administrative costs, fines, strengthening of internal
policies and procedures, further reporting, management changes, and other
supervisory requirements.

Current issues in state enforcement.  Many state securities administrators
have adopted a more aggressive posture in cases that combine a securities
firm's failure to disclose significant risks - notably of derivatives
investments - with allegations of its failure to make suitable recommendations
or to supervise.  State regulators demonstrate an increasing interest in
cooperative ventures with other states to attack regional or national
securities firms on matters at the cutting edge of securities liability,
without waiting for definitive SEC guidance.  In registration cases, the
states now often insist that issuers produce "stickered" prospectuses and add
special legends to sales literature to highlight, beyond SEC requirements, any
enhanced investment risks that the regulators perceive in the investment.

Regulation Of Canadian Capital Markets In The 1990s: The United States 
In The Driver's Seat

By Prof. Cally Jordan
McGill University Faculty of Law
Pacific Rim Law & Policy Journal
Vol. 4, No. 3, Pgs. 577-632

Overview:  Summarizes the Canadian system of securities regulation and
contrasts it with the US system.  Explores the development of US/Canadian
multijurisdictional regulation, and evaluates its impact on the Canadian
system.  Appends two detailed narratives summarizing Canada's regulatory
systems and enforcement provisions applicable to domestic and foreign issuers.

Subtle differences underlie.  Canadian securities regulation, constitutionally
relegated to provincial rather than federal control, resembles US federal
regulation, but it adds subtle adaptations and differs slightly in its
emphasis.  The legislation, especially in Ontario (the de facto
standard-setter), is drafted in a simpler, more modern style, while Canada's
regulatory structures have developed largely outside the formal statutory
provisions, on a more consensual, nearly ad hoc basis.  The extrastatutory
regulatory system in Ontario fell to a legal challenge in 1993, resulting in
the 1994 adoption of legislation authorizing SEC-type rulemaking.  A notable
contrast in the countries' emphasis appears in Canada's treatment of
registration exemptions:  unlike the subjective tests of investment intent
that SEC rules impose, Canada favors clear, bright-line rules.  For example,
no prospectus is required under the Ontario private placement rules for a
single purchase of securities worth over Cdn $150,000.

Multijurisdiction's disadvantages.  The 1991 implementation of the US/Canadian
Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) significantly impacted Canadian
securities regulation.  Under the MJDS, an issuer can rely on disclosure
documents filed in its home country to satisfy the other country's
requirements.  Canadians find the system more complex than they had hoped,
because the US did not ease its liability rules for the prospectus.  Thus, a
Canadian prospectus used in the US under the MJDS still looks very much like a
US prospectus.  The chief Canadian beneficiaries of the system so far have
been issuers of high-grade debt securities, whose primary disclosures consist
of third-party ratings.  The MJDS's greatest impact to date is seen in
Canada's harmonizing adoption of US practices such as shelf registration.

Ontario's aggressive recognition policy.  The Ontario Securities Commission
has forged new ground in applying MJDS principles on a unilateral basis.  In
its draft National Policy No.  53, the OSC has proposed permitting a
substantial foreign issuer of global offerings to use its domestic filings
from any country to comply with Ontario requirements.  The policy would have
permitted even exempt transactions such as Rule 144A offerings to use only
offering memoranda in Ontario, but under pressure the OSC has now retreated
from this policy extension.  The OSC also issued a ruling allowing limited use
of US and UK private offering memoranda in Ontario private offerings.  This
private placement ruling may pose a problem because of the common-law
mechanisms by which persons claim damages for misrepresentation, at least
until the Ontario legislature enacts a statutory remedy.

Editor's Note:  The full text as well as a summary analysis of the current
securities laws and regulations for Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec are
included in the International Securities Laws Handbook, a three-volume
publication available from Bowne.  Updated quarterly, the Handbook also

The Duties And Liabilities Of Lead Managers In Syndicated Loans

By Gautam Bhattacharyya
Denton Hall, London, England
Company Lawyer
Vol. 16, No. 9, Pgs. 259-263

Overview:  Considers the common-law and statutory liabilities of loan
syndication managers in the UK.  Reviews recent cases on misleading
informational memoranda in the UK and elsewhere.  Addresses the use and
effectiveness of exculpatory clauses in underwriting agreements and
information memoranda.

Liability of syndication managers.  The lead lender in a syndicated commercial
loan usually undertakes the preparation of an informational memorandum to
solicit interest from other potential lenders.  This prospectus-like document
draws its content largely from the borrower, but by preparing it, the lead
manager can become liable for common-law negligence or deceit and, under
special statutory provisions in the UK, for any misrepresentations.  A person
ordinarily is liable only for negligent misrepresentations made to those in
contractual proximity; for example, in the UK, auditors are not liable to the
general public for misstatements in a company's financial statements.  Lead
managers, however, have the requisite proximity to the other members of the
loan syndication.  Their special relationship permits recovery for negligent
misrepresentations in the information memorandum on which the other members
relied.  Under the UK's Misrepresentations Act of 1967, a syndicate member
that made a loan based on an erroneous memorandum merely needs to allege a
misstatement; this shifts the burden of proof onto the lead manager, which
must then show the absence of negligence.

Harder cases:  deceit and fiduciary duty.  In contrast to proving common-law
negligence and statutory liability for contractual misrepresentations,
syndicate members would have a more difficult time proving a lead manager's
liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.  The plaintiff in a case of deceit
must show scienter or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
misstatement.  Despite occasional court dictum to the contrary, British and
other Commonwealth courts have declined to find a fiduciary relationship
between a lead manager and the syndicate members.  Courts tend to view
commercial banks in these transactions as sophisticated parties, acting at
arm's length, well able to protect themselves without the benefit of the
special relationships of trust imposed in the absence of particular
contractual clauses.

Exclusionary clauses to limit liabilities.  Lead managers commonly seek to
avoid negligence liability by disclaiming it in syndication agreements and in
the information memorandum itself.  Such clauses generally fail to protect
against liability for fraud.  Their effectiveness against liability for
negligence depends on their status under the Unfair Contract Terms Act of 1977
(the "UCTA").  The UCTA states that the disclaimer must be reasonable and the
affected party must receive advance notice of the liability disclaimer,
thereby raising doubt over the effectiveness of disclaimers that exist only in
the memorandum.

In a 1993 Australian Supreme Court case, NatWest Australia Bank Ltd.  v.
Tricontinental Corp.  Ltd., the court found such a clause ineffective where a
syndicate member had specifically inquired about certain borrower accounts and
had received specific assurances from the lead lender.  Other British cases
that refused to enforce liability disclaimers rest on the parties' unequal
bargaining power, suggesting that ordinary syndication situations will not run
afoul of the UCTA.  As an agent for the other lenders, the lead manager may
owe some duty of due care and skill when preparing the loan documentation, but
recent decisions have characterized the problem as "poor draftsmanship" and
too remote to permit recovery.

London Market Starts Up

By Derham O'Neill
Clifford Chance, London, England
National Law Journal
December 4, 1995, Pgs. C1-C4

Overview:  Describes the advent of a new, second-tier securities market in the
United Kingdom.  Compares its listing and reporting criteria to those of
earlier "unlisted" markets and the NASDAQ.  Analyzes the new market's
potential impact on issuers and investors.

Europe needs a NASDAQ.  Because other European efforts to emulate the success
of the US's floorless exchange - NASDAQ - have not succeeded.  the London
Stock Exchange is replacing its Unlisted Securities Market with the
Alternative Investment Market (AIM).  AIM is the first of several second-tier
markets planned for Europe; one in Paris and a Europe-wide market known as
EASDAQ are under development.  The objective of these markets is to create an
environment for newer, small-cap companies that offers regulatory and
disclosure standards adequate to reassure investors but not so complex or
expensive that issuers will forgo the benefits of public listing.  The
Exchange intends for AIM eventually to supplant not only the Unlisted
Securities Market but also the quasi-unregulated "Rule 4.2" market, although
currently the latter continues in existence.

Listing criteria favor new issues.  Since the AIM primarily wants to serve
newly public companies, its listing requirements do not cover trading history,
past public float, or minimum public share holdings.  This contrasts with the
major exchanges and even NASDAQ, whose "small-cap" listing requires $1 million
in publicly held shares.  To list on AIM, a company must have freely tradable
shares, publish financial statements in compliance with US, UK, or
International GAAP, and designate an exchange-approved "nominated advisor" and
a "nominated broker."  A nominated advisor verifies compliance with the entry
requirements, advises the issuer on the listing and reporting rules, and
confirms the issuer's internal due diligence program, but need not certify the
issuer's working capital.  A nominated broker (which must be an Exchange
member) is not a marketmaker but must use its best efforts to find trade
matches if no marketmaker exists.

Reporting and notification obligations.  AIM-listed companies must publish
prospectuses complying with the European Union's Public Offering Prospectus
Directive of 1989, but AIM does not review the prospectuses in advance of
publication.  AIM companies must disclose certain acquisitions and
related-party transactions, but at higher thresholds than regularly listed
companies must observe and without obtaining prior shareholder approval.
Because of the prevalence of newly public companies on AIM, directors and
employees must agree not to sell their shares for one year following admission
to listing.  The UK's new insider-trading regulations apply to AIM companies,
which must adopt codes of conduct that prohibit insider trading at least for
specified key periods during the year and must report transgressions to the
new exchange.

Prospects for success mixed.  The key investors in Europe remain institutions,
which historically have resisted illiquid investments.  It may turn out that
AIM's lack of capitalization threshold, compared to the relatively small
thresholds on more established markets, will raise resistance in these
investors.  AIM shows promise as a "nursery" for newly public companies, which
may later avail themselves of the LSE's upgrade privilege to list on the main
exchange after two years on AIM without having to issue new listing
particulars.  The development of additional second-tier markets in Europe
indicates that many securities professionals believe Europe is ready for a
NASDAQ-like opportunity for public trading of smaller and newer companies.

Joint Ventures And Opportunity Doctrine Problems

By Stephen Glover
Fried Frank et al., Washington, DC
Insights: Corporate & Securities Law Advisor
Vol. 9, No. 11, Pgs. 9-17

Overview:  Speculates on how joint ventures will test the opportunity
doctrine's limits.  Discusses the factors that courts consider when evaluating
the doctrine.  Suggests ways that joint venturers can tackle the problem when
establishing an enterprise.

Testing the limits.  The corporate opportunity doctrine, an element of the
duty of loyalty, protects an enterprise from self-dealing by its fiduciaries.
The increasing use of joint venturing between well-established companies will
test the parameters of the doctrine.  Directors, officers, and significant
shareholders (or the partners in a partnership) cannot divert business
opportunities to themselves that "belong" to the company.  This doctrine can
create problems for venturers when their own businesses are closely related to
that of the joint venture.  For example, a telecommunications company and a
software company might form a joint venture to develop products for
interactive television.  The telecom company might want to use the technology
created by the joint venture in the telecom field generally, but the corporate
opportunity doctrine seems to bar it from doing so.  A similar problem arises
if an officer of the telecom company who sits on the joint venture's board
learns of an opportunity that could be exploited by either the company or the
joint venture; that person faces a conflict of fiduciary duties.

The doctrine's parameters.  Several courts have articulated tests for the
doctrine.  Delaware calls its analysis the "line of business" test.
Fiduciaries cannot pursue opportunities that fall within the corporation's
line of business and that the corporation financially could develop.
Regardless of how they describe the doctrine, most courts consider six factors
in deciding whether a fiduciary may pursue an opportunity:  1) whether the
opportunity falls within the company's present or planned line of business; 2)
whether the company values the opportunity; 3) if corporate assets developed
the opportunity; 4) if the fiduciaries learned of the opportunity while acting
in their corporate capacities; 5) whether the company possesses the financial
wherewithal to exploit the opportunity; and 6) if the parties had any
agreement, express or tacit, on using such opportunities.  Cases applying the
factors tend to be fact-specific and provide only limited guidance for others.
Courts have, however, followed one clear rule:  Fiduciaries may pursue
something when they disclose the opportunity to the company and it expressly
allows the fiduciary to proceed, or if the corporation knew of the fiduciary's
activities and did not take steps to halt them.

Tackle the problem in advance.  Companies forming joint ventures should
address opportunity conflicts at the outset.  Carefully define the business
that the joint venture will address.  Consider including a precise description
of the venture's purpose in its corporate charter (this will render ultra
vires any activities outside the prescribed purpose and thus will settle
conflicts by requiring a charter amendment before the venture can proceed).
As a corollary, participants might enter into covenants not to compete with
the joint venture in its prescribed business.  Identify and allocate, in
advance, specific opportunities that might arise.  Determine in advance what
use each participant can make of technology developed by the joint venture,
perhaps through licensing and royalty arrangements.  Design a consent
procedure to be followed when opportunity problems arise.  Clarify how
fiduciaries of both parent and venture will disclose opportunities, and
exculpate them for disclosures made in accordance with the procedure.

Partnerships and LLCs.  Partners owe a duty of loyalty to one another.  Courts
consider factors similar to those considered for the corporate setting, but
they give particular weight to the partnership document itself.  Because
partnerships are contractual in nature, partners have more latitude to
establish the boundaries of their duties to one another than the corporate
setting allows.  The opportunity doctrine also applies to limited liability
companies.  Because this structure is relatively new, the parameters of the
doctrine's application to LLCs have not been defined and almost no case law
exists.  LLC venturers are well-advised to proceed under the assumption that
LLC members owe one another a duty of loyalty, similar to that in the
corporate and partnership settings.

LOMAR/ILFM Survey Offers Latest Data on Staff Pay

     Last month law firm staff probably received a welcome
surprise after their year-end salary reviews. With firms
seeing the first real economic gains since the start of the
decade at least according to most of the key industry
benchmarks it stands to reason that administrators and
managing partners were less apprehensive about approving
larger pay hikes for support staff in 1996.

     As LOMAR previously reported, salary increases for 1996
were generally expected to stand in the range of 4%, with
firms of fewer than 500 employees likely to award 4.24%, and
those with 500 to 1,499 granting raises of about 4.04%. But as
all law firm administrators and managing partners know, staff
salary increases don't always follow predictions. 

     Sharing the wealth. In 1995, for the most part,
compensation increases for law firm support staff exceeded,
and in many cases handsomely exceeded, cost-of-living hikes,
according to the just-released 1995 Law Office Management &
Administration Report (LOMAR)/Institute on Law Firm Management
(ILFM) Compensation and Hourly Billing Survey. Across the
board, support staff, secretaries, and word processors fared
better in the smaller firms than they did in the larger ones.
In fact, secretaries and word processors fared least well in
the largest (75-plus attorney) firms (see partial Table 1
below--complete version in printed newsletter only).

     LOMAR's analysis of the data relating to a number of key
law firm positions, including secretaries, word processors,
and other support staff, reveals some interesting trends which
are described below:

     Secretaries. In this category 1995 pay ranged from a low
of $19,000 to a high of $33,000, depending on firm size, years
of experience, and reporting duties.

     o Legal secretaries with less than three years'
experience were hit the hardest in all size firms, with three
sizes cutting their total compensation by as much as 17.4% and
others holding steady at 1994 pay levels.

     o Those with more than three years of experience fared
better, with three sizes of firms reporting increases (one by
as much as 20%) and the other two holding steady.

     o Across the board, secretaries who work for two
associates earned less than those shared by a partner and an
associate, but the dual-associate secretaries reported a
higher percentage pay increase than did any other category of
secretary.

     o Secretaries who report to partners were paid the most
in large firms ($33,000), but were ompensated at nearly the
same level ($32,000) by firms with only two to eight
attorneys.

     Word processors. Pay for this position ranged from a low
of $22,000 at firms with two to eight attorneys to a high of
$31,000 at firms with 75-plus lawyers. Firms that gave this
position the largest hikes in 1995 were those with nine to 20
lawyers (a 9.1% increase) and those with 41 to 74 attorneys
(6.1%).

     o Average salaries for word processors in the smallest
size firms, however, dropped substantially in 1995.

     Other support staff. LOMAR's analysis of a few of the
many positions reveals that accounting managers/controllers,
for the most part, failed even to keep up with cost-of-living
increases in 1995. The largest salary hike, given at firms
with 41 to 74 attorneys, was 6.3%. But other than that,
increases hovered around 1% to 2%. In the case of firms with
two to eight attorneys, the average salary dropped
substantially.

     o Pay hikes for switchboard operators/receptionists
ranged from 0% to 25% (the latter, once again, in firms with
41 to 74 attorneys). Pay levels for 1995 ranged from $18,000
in firms with two to eight attorneys to $25,000 in firms with
41 to 74 lawyers.


     o Personnel director pay scales hovered in the
$37,000-to-$40,000 area for smaller firms. However, those with
41 or more attorneys earned $48,000 to $60,000. The LOMAR/ILFM
survey did no year-to-year comparisons on this title, computer
positions, and several others because the sample size was not
large enough (see Table 2 for positions with counts of less
than 75--table available in print version only). Therefore, no
percentage differences are listed on Table 1. 

     Nonetheless, the size of the salary paid to those in the
personnel administrator position does reveal that more law
firms are recognizing the importance of this position for both
controlling costs and keeping the firm in compliance with this
increasingly complex area of administration.

     o As for automation personnel, in firms large enough to
support a local area network (LAN) coordinator, pay ranged
from $39,000 to $47,000.

     In-house computer trainers were paid less than
receptionists at the smaller firms, reflecting the fact that
many of these posts now work part-time. Firms reported MIS
director pay scales from $30,000 to $65,000, with levels
largely tied to firm size.

     Regional variations. The Pacific and South Atlantic
regions generally paid their secretaries the most. Pacific
firms took top honors except for secretaries who are shared by
two associates and those who serve a partner/associate/legal
assistant team. In those instances, firms in the South
Atlantic states paid the most.

     Billing coordinators fared best in the Middle Atlantic
states, where firms paid$34,000. This contrasts sharply with
the Central and Plains states where they were more commonly
paid $22,000.

Could This Be It: A Partner Compensation Plan That Really
Works? 

     Few issues in today's law firm can spark as much raw 
emotion or portend real damage to the spirit of the
organization as partner compensation. While a few firms may
have managed to devise systems that equitably reward all
partners, most are still struggling to strike that delicate
balance.

     The Cyber Chapter members who took part in a recent
Association of Legal Administrators' online forum via
CompuServe seemed all too aware of the many subtle pitfalls
associated with partner compensation. "Rewarding fee
generation alone tends to be divisive, works contrary to
collegiality, and doesn't properly reflect the contributions
that are essential to the continuation and growth of the
firm," one participant asserted.

     True, indeed. Just ask anyone who's followed the accounts
leading up to the demise of Mudge Rose, which just months ago
voted to dissolve after 126 years of existence. Surely most
observers were surprised--to say the least--when The Wall
Street Journal reported that the firm's demise was
precipitated, in part, by an inability to reach consensus on
whether to retain "unproductive" partners and how best to
compensate "productive" members of the firm. 

     If Mudge Rose--which up until last year had earned enough
in gross revenues to regularly assume a spot on The American
Lawyer's annual ranking of the nation's richest firms--
couldn't hold it together, what does it mean to others coping
with similar issues relating to partner compensation?  

     "Giving and awarding credit for attorney origination is
not as easy as you would think," another administrator noted
online. "It is clear that when you bring in a client you
should get some credit for the origination, but how about the
additional tasks from that client that are created by the good
work of another attorney?" 

     The same administrator continued: "Also, when you bring
in a transactional client who has lots of small files, how
long does the originating attorney receive credit for the
ongoing shipment of small files, how do you factor credits....
Does an attorney whose major role is origination [need] a
different compensation plan? If you have advice, I'd love to
see it." 

     Exploring alternatives. Administrators and managing
partners are fully cognizant that no generic compensation
system is perfect for every law firm. Partners will always
perceive inequities and partner compensation schemes are, for
the most part, driven by intangibles, like firm culture and
personality. But, since some system is obviously necessary,
examining the so-called model plans is a logical first step. 

     Outlined below is part of a compensation plan devised by
John Iezzi, consultant and president of Richmond, Va.'s Iezzi
Management Group and a LOMAR contributor. While the sampling
embodies the basics of Iezzi's plan, readers can receive a
free copy of the complete Compensation Plan for Owners of
Professional Service Firms and all applicable exhibits by
contacting the IOMA Fax Retrieval System at 212-244-0360 #250.
Request Document #2 and it will be faxed to you immediately.
Questions and comments on the specifics of the plan should be
directed to John Iezzi at P.O. Box 1711, Richmond, VA 23214-
1711; 804-342-1206; Fax: 804-342-1209.

     Iezzi's compensation plan is based on both objective and
subjective criteria. In addition to rewarding individual
achievements based on attorney productivity and business
development, the plan also takes into account the activities
and contributions that a partner makes to the good of the firm
which may not be so easily quantifiable.

     Since firm data can change regularly, it is suggested
that once the plan is in effect, the information used in the
formula should be based on a three-year moving average. Thus,
until the three-year period can be determined, certain
adjustments may have to be made to account for significant
events which occur during the year being reviewed. Adjustments
will also need to be made for those owners who do not have a
three-year history of activity on which to draw. 

     At the end of a 12-month period, (not necessarily
corresponding to the firm's accounting year), information
would be generated on the total amount of working attorney and
originating attorney credits assignable to each partner. 

     Iezzi's plan is based on three major criteria:

     1. Working attorney credits. These are receipts (not
billable hours or billings) from work performed by the
individual partner. Working attorney points would be created
by determining the percentage that each partner's working
attorney credits bore to the working attorney credits of all
the other partners. Using an example of a firm with $2 million
in revenues, $933,500 came from the five partners. Partner A
had $210,000 of the total, so received 22.5 compensation
points.

     2. Originating attorney credits. These are receipts
(again not billable hours or billings) from work performed on
all files that can be identified as having been originated by
a particular partner. Figuring originating attorney points,
again using the example of the $2 million firm: $1.9 million
could be identified as having been originated by the current
group of five partners. In this case, Partner A was credited
for $496,000 of the total, or 26.1 compensation points.

     ln the above two situations, the points can be "weighted"
based on the value that the firm perceives is attributable to
these factors. In this case, both the working credits and the
originating credits have been given a factor of 1.0. There is
no magic to this; they can be whatever the firm's partners
decide. Thus, under this scenario, Partner A received 26.1
originating attorney points.

     3. Subjective criteria. This last group of factors is
developed to reward a partner's contributions to the firm
outside of the objective data. Elements to be considered
include firm management, associate training/mentoring,
cooperativeness with staff and firm procedures, bar
activities, community/civic activities, speaking and
publishing, financial management effectiveness (i.e., billings
management), and technical skills. 

     Each partner submits a self-evaluation report which is
reviewed by all the other partners or the compensation
committee. The partners or the committee then grade their
other partners on these criteria, based on a 100-point total.

     The criteria are individually weighted. The averages of
the ratings are then used to determine the points attributable
to this category. In the event the firm finds it difficult to
allocate the 100 points to each partner for the subjective
criteria, it could instead assign a value which could then be
easily translated into a percentage.

     These values would then be weighted, totaled, and a
percentage developed to establish the subjective element of
the compensation plan, along with the working-attorney and
originating-attorney components. The total points, after
application of the weighting factors, are then determined.
     Special considerations. There are certain problems that
occur with this type of system (all of which are also
described in the full report). While none is insurmountable,
each does need to be considered. 

     For instance, at some point, particularly for the larger,
general practice firms, this type of plan may be inapplicable-
-specifically as it relates to the issue of origination
credits. Larger firms owe many of their new clients not to any
person but to the firm as an institution which has built a
reputation that attracts clients. In addition, marketing
programs have changed to the point where teams rather than
individuals are often responsible for obtaining new clients. 

     But no compensation plan is perfect nor can any respond
to the totality of the compensation requirements in a firm.
Iezzi's plan has been designed to recognize as many of the
issues as possible, with the understanding that certain
modifications will need to be made before the final
percentages can be developed.

Nine More Ways to Reduce Firm Costs in the New Year

     Law firm administrators and managing partners are
constantly looking for new cost-control ideas, or at least
ways to continue improving existing programs in the coming
year. Here are nine cost-control areas in which firms tell
LOMAR they've had success:

     1. Temporary staff. To get temps up and running as
quickly as possible, one firm has developed a brief "Temporary
Employee's Procedure Manual." It includes a simple office
layout, showing whose office is where; a brief style manual
for letters and other simple documents; details about how the
firm wants the phone answered; where supplies are located; the
firm's break policy; and several things that the firm does not
want the temp to do.

     2. Health care costs. All firms have taken steps to
control these expenses in recent years. But it's interesting
to note that a survey of human resource executives by Ernst &
Young ranked the popularity of cost-cutting options as
follows: First, increasing employee contributions (26%);
second, introducing a PPO (preferred provider organization)
arrangement (17%); three options tied for third--adding a
flexible benefits program, changing the insurance
carrier/administrator, and introducing POS (point-of-service)
arrangements (9% each); sixth, adding an HMO (7%); and
seventh, reducing benefits coverage (6%).

     3. Faxes. Pitney Bowes suggests curbing high fax-related
phone costs by buying a faster modem. About 70% of fax
machines are equipped with a 9.5 Kbp modem. A switch to a
14.4-units (or faster, though reception times may interfere
with the improvements) model would reduce the average
transmission time of a five-page document by 64%. This could
cut phone costs by up to $1,450 per year per fax machine.

     4. Firm brochures. Beware of too-low bids when looking
for a typesetter and printer. Some typesetters will quote a
break-even price, and then charge for each correction, knowing
full well that they will profit enormously on the many changes
that law firms typically make. Printers may give you an
extremely low quote, and then pull a "switcheroo" on the paper
you've selected, replacing it with a lower-quality stock
that's less expensive. 

     5. Cellular phones. Keith Fetridge of Aronson Fetridge &
Weigle (Bethesda, Md.) suggests negotiating the cost of your
monthly fee and the add-on services. Some providers will
eliminate these fees for large users. It also pays to audit
your monthly phone bills. Research concludes that up to 30%
contain at least one error.

     6. Online services. To control costs, limit the number of
staff and attorneys who are given online access. And write and
distribute a policy that specifies that online services must
be used only for purposes that benefit the firm or its
clients. 

     7. Staff management. Surprisingly, a quick staff meeting
may be less expensive than writing a memo. Studies show that
routine memos are written once and then rewritten 4.2 times.
And it typically takes 54 minutes to plan, compose, and edit
the first draft alone.

     8. Copiers. Saving money by purchasing less-expensive
paper can backfire by causing chronic paper jams. Most copiers
are designed to handle 20-lb. bond paper that is uniform. The
cheaper the paper, the greater the variation (in stiffness,
density, size, and so on) from sheet to sheet. And
inconsistencies lead to paper jams.

     9. Lawyers' offices. Today's standard offices are smaller
than ever. According to architects, the optimum office for
senior partners is now 150 to 225 sq. ft. For partners, it's
150 to 180 sq. ft. And for associates, it's just 100 to 150
sq. ft.

What Can Law Firms Learn From Others About Marketing?

     Chances are your firm's marketing staff is fully aware of
the benefits of benchmarking and is already informally engaged
in the process. Many are members of the National Law Firm
Marketing Association or the Association of Legal
Administrators and have ample opportunity to share tactics at
national and local meetings.

     Those firms that want to enhance their "casual"
benchmarking efforts, however, must begin the ever-expanding
quest to identify "best-in-class" organizations that have
achieved excellence in areas in which the firm too would like
to excel. And these don't have to be law firms. Other
professional service firms, corporations, even clients may be
helpful in helping your firm's marketers and attorneys to
develop so-called external benchmarks.

     Why are external benchmarks important? For starters,
consider that without them, your firm's internally focused
marketing team has access to few new ideas that can lead to
creative solutions. Without knowing what is outside, the focus
of the team is limited and the results can be average at best.

     Recognizing that external benchmarks can be useful to law
firms trying to educate themselves about alternatives, a
recent study, Benchmarking the Best Practices in Client
Development, set out to compare the most effective initiatives
used by law, accounting/management consulting, and other
professional services firms. The study's legal component--
spearheaded by Julie Savarino, attorney and director of
Detroit's Business Development, Inc., was based on
questionnaires completed by 1,200 leading firms of all sizes
in the U.S., Canada, England, and Australia. Follow-up phone
calls and focus groups were then conducted to identify some of
the best practices used.

     Key findings. The information is outlined below:

     o Best practices. Participants reported that 10 types of
marketing efforts yield positive results. They are:
newsletters/bulletins; individual marketing plans; seminars;
one-to-one communications; consulting services;
industry/target/niche efforts; referrals; community
involvement; responding to proposals; and brochures. Most of
the law firms queried, however, still rely on what Savarino
terms "first-generation" marketing efforts which include the
use of tools such as seminars, newsletters, and publicity.

     Although accounting/management consulting and other
professional services firms gave industry/target/niche
marketing high marks, law firm respondents remained
unconvinced. According to the report, however, many law firms
plan to add industry-defined practice areas or groups to their
firms' organizational structure (see Figures 1 and 2 on page
3--bar charts available in printed version only).

     o Marketing departments. Only half of the law firms that
responded had dedicated marketing staff or an in-house
marketing department. By comparison, 70% of
accounting/management consulting firms and more than 80% of
other professional services firms had in-house marketers.

     And those law firms that do have marketers use them to
support a larger number of professionals than do
accounting/management consulting and other professional
services firms. Overall, the average marketing staff to
professional ratio is 45 to 1; in law firms the average ratio
is 65 to 1, the highest (see Figure 3 on page 3--printed
version only).

     But half of all responding firms plan to increase the
size of their marketing departments in coming years, with most
adding coordinator/support staff-level professionals. Almost
one-third of responding law firms plan to add sales/client
development professionals to their departments. About 45% of
responding firms plan to maintain the size of their marketing
departments.

     Impediments to effective marketing. In law firms, the
lack of commitment by attorneys was cited as an obstacle twice
as often as the corresponding professionals' level of
commitment in accounting/management consulting and other
professional service firms. Asked what it would take to
overcome marketing barriers, the respondents listed: greater
involvement of firm leadership; marketing training and
education; monetary incentives; time management; use of
marketing plans; creating marketing department efficiencies;
and using marketing budgeting tools.

Records and Files: The 'Status Quo' Can Be Expensive

     Law firm administrators and managing partners putting the
finishing touches on their organizations' agendas for the New
Year will probably overlook one issue that's generally taken
for granted: records retention. But the hidden costs
associated with time wasted by staff searching for hard to
find files (not to mention the obvious legal implications and
their potential costs) should prompt those firms that have
been gathering client records and files for storage, moving
records from partners' desks to the file cabinets, or keeping
documents off-site indefinitely to make more frequent reviews
of their record-retention policies.

     Where to begin? Statutes of limitations and state and
governmental agency requirements vary from state to state, of
course, and firms must determine what requirements hold for
the states in which they practice--for client as well as firm
records. In addition, the Association of Legal Administrators'
minimum document retention guidelines provided in the sidebar
on page 4 should prove useful as a starting point for firms
assessing their current policy.  

     Other considerations. While few firms employ full-time
records-management personnel, most find it efficient to assign
one person this additional responsibility, often within
practice areas. 

     Although new records-management technology, e.g., optical
disk imaging, may seem expensive, firms that have used it
report lower labor costs. 

     When it's time to move records off-site, firm
administrators can contact the Association of Commercial
Record Centers (ACRC), a nonprofit trade association for off
site information management companies. For a list of members
in your area, call 800-336-9793.

Mastering Powerful Leadership Without Uttering a Word (Or 
Becoming a Dictator)

     For managing partners and administrators, failing to
strike a balance between wielding power and providing
effective leadership can prove disastrous. As most will
readily attest, few in the law firm environment respect
authority simply because one demands it. On the contrary, many
of the "difficult" lawyers LOMAR knows respect those leaders
who consider their input before taking action.

     Although there are no management courses entitled "Law
Firm Listening 101," perhaps there should be. A recent study
by the American Management Association confirms that listening
is number one among the top 10 management activities. And
eight of the 10 activities involve attending to what others
say. Providing a vision, giving direction, training others,
conducting meetings, and communicating decisions, for example,
all require a keen ear. Another management study found that
listening takes up 53% of a typical executive's day, followed
by reading (17%), speaking (26%), and writing (14%).

     What issues have an adverse impact on communication in
law firms? Managing partners and administrators queried by
LOMAR indicate some common obstacles:

     o "As a lawyer, my tendency is to do the same thing [in
managing the firm] that I do when I'm trying a case, which is
to reinforce a position," the managing partner of a midsize
firm confided. "We're all trained to do a kind of active
listening with witnesses which makes it difficult to
communicate effectively at other times."

     o A managing partner with a New York City-based firm, who
admits that he is determined to build his listening skills,
offered this observation: "When you're feeling stretched in
all directions, taking the time to stop and listen can be
extremely difficult. I do everything possible to put aside my
practice problems and talk, but still it's hard to do. I work
at it, quite frankly, because that's my role as managing
partner."

     Listening is an active art that involves two functions:
Finding out what people know and finding out what they don't
know. Although the latter is the more important skill, it is
difficult to cultivate. The key, say a majority of the
administrators and managing partners LOMAR interviewed, lies
in listening between the lines--and above the cacophony of
other demands and practice-related stresses. (See the sidebar
below for tips on enhancing others' perceptions of these firm
leaders' power and authority.)

     The consensus of those interviewed is that the strong,
silent types who can lead their firms "through burning
buildings--and worse" tend to share the following
characteristics:

     1. They find areas of common interest. This is not the
same as being a consensus-builder. As one lawyer in a
Southeast firm says, "Our managing partner asks a lot of
questions, but he can process responses with incredible speed.
He sifts through it all and assists us in identifying the
chaff and the wheat."

     2. They judge the content and overlook style. They don't
tune out the dull, laconic, or loquacious messengers or the
dry, seemingly tedious topics of discussion. Instead, they
seek out whatever is of value to the group or the firm as a
whole, no matter where it may originate.

     "Our managing partner is quick to defend others who are
summarily shot down or ignored because of lack of presence,"
one practitioner remarks. "He restates the good ideas from
their comments and enables us to focus on them in a way the
original speaker couldn't."

     3. They hold their fire--even under attack. They don't
argue or respond until they fully understand the objections
that have been made. And they never answer a question until it
is fully asked. Confrontations are met with calm and reason
and followed up with rational points. 

     4. They look for and address breakdowns in communication.
"In my firm, probably like most, we had an unwritten policy
that the administrator would handle staff problems and I would
look after the lawyers," the New York-based managing partner
explains. "I know now that [the policy] actually worsened our
communications problem. You don't turn people away that
readily. Now I ask, 'Why did you come to me instead of our
administrator or your practice group leader, and what can I do
to facilitate matters?'" 

     5. They don't fake attention. "We had one managing
partner who wanted to be 'powerful' but just came off as phony
and insincere with his overly solicitous manner," one
practitioner told LOMAR. "People know from your tone, body
language, and so forth whether your interest is genuine."

     6. They are open-minded and inquisitive. People tend to
construct reality, so paying careful attention to the
perceptions of others takes on added importance. The New York
partner recounts the case, which he admits he could have
handled better, of a partner taken aback when a move to a
branch office left him temporarily in an office without a
window.

     "When you're dealing with lawyers, you know that if
you're not careful an argument is always possible," he quips.
"I explained the mistake, but what I was saying was completely
misinterpreted, and I lost my temper." What could he have done
to defuse the problem? In the managing partner's mind, the
issue was frivolous and he dismissed it summarily when active
listening, asking questions, and being more sensitive to the
situation  might have averted the confrontation.

     In the end, if there's a benefit to being a "strong,
silent type," it's that sooner or later, people start to pay
attention. Or, as many of the administrators and managing
partners that LOMAR interviewed concluded about their most
influential peers: When they speak, others listen.

[-Five Communication Enhancers for Managing Partners and
Administrators-]

     1. Identify your communications style. Some managing
partners and administrators communicate more effectively
through conversation and others through written communication.
And some respond better to one form than the other. It all
depends on the individual. It's important to identify and
understand how you are most effective.

     2. Recognize varying styles. Everyone has a different way
of communicating. In addition to understanding your style,
make an attempt to identify the recipients' without making
snap judgments based on intangibles such as personality and
appearance. Remember that law firms have a myriad of
personality types--from the silent ones and belligerent
tyrants to the apple polishers and sensitive soldiers. You
can't effectively communicate with each in the same manner.

      3. Be consistent. Once you identify your style of
communicating, it will confuse your messages if you stray from
it. If you routinely go to others to discuss issues in person,
don't start calling meetings in your office when minor matters
are involved. Use "unusual" communications techniques only
when all else fails.

     4. Limit technological exchanges. With the proliferation
of voice mail, e-mail, and telecommunications, many managing
partners and administrators have little incentive to
communicate face-to-face. Try to strike a balance between
personal contact and "impersonal" electronic conversations
that may limit your ability to get information across
effectively. Routine communications--along the line of 'I
thought you might like to know'--might be made via phone or e
mail, but crucial discussions should be conducted face-to-face
and in the listeners' environment. 

     5. Say it in person. It may be easier to give someone bad
news or to criticize in writing, but such serious
communications must be issued in person. Follow up with
written confirmation of what was said to avoid
misunderstandings. Written communication is most useful when
the same message must be given to more than one person.

LOMAR Law Office Cost Index

     Each month LOMAR updates its Law Office Cost Index for
major cities nationwide. This exclusive LOMAR monthly feature
is aimed at helping accounting firm managing partners and
administrators monitor relevant office cost changes within
their area and compare them with other regions.

     This index excludes lawyers' salaries, benefits, and
profit shares.

     The index covers all other major cost factors in the
accounting office including: rent and other space expenses,
equipment, support personnel, stationery, insurance, phone,
etc.

     The index is derived from data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the American Chamber of Commerce, and Statistics
Canada. The base of 100 is for the national average in the
first quarter of 1992. Current figures follow actuals by 90
days.

LOMAR News Briefs

       o Three suggestions for law firm administrators
awaiting long overdue performance evaluations.
Managing partners who overlooked such appraisals
should also take note of the comments gleaned from
the Association of Legal Administrators' (ALA; 708-
816-1212) online forum via CompuServe and, if
necessary, start the ball rolling as soon as
possible. 
  
       1. Pursue the matter. "Only once in my five
  years with this firm have I received a review
  [though] every year I prepare the form and send it
  out. Last year the managing member walked into my
  office, handed back the review, [and] said 'You want
  a review, you're here aren't you? That's your
  review,'" one administrator lamented. "I gave up.
  After five years they finally got to me."
  
       2. Apply gentle pressure. "At the same time as
  everyone else's review and salary decisions, I would
  provide partners with a document that detailed all
  the things they said they wanted to accomplish over
  the year and what was the result. The list was
  primarily from the prior year's review and included
  items that came up at partner meetings," explained
  one administrator. "Also added to the list were
  things that were by my own initiation.... I felt the
  document worked for both the partners and myself
  because they also had a list of things that I had
  accomplished."
  
       3. Put the process in motion_quickly. "I passed
  out an evaluation form from the ALA and had all the
  partners fill it out. It took me 90 days to get it
  done," offered another law firm administrator who
  had gone almost two years without an official
  evaluation. "We did the basic accomplishments and
  goals...they even interviewed staff to get their
  opinion and gave me a great raise. The only thing
  [the firm] didn't do was make the raise retroactive
  back to my anniversary date like everyone else. What
  I learned was to start 90 days in advance."
  
       o Time to honor exceptional effort. The ABA's
  Standing Committee on Lawyers' Public Service
  Responsibilities is seeking nominations for its 1996
  Pro Bono Publico Awards. Five awards will be
  presented at the ABA's annual meeting in Orlando,
  July 31-Aug. 4. For details on the nominating
  process, contact Dorothy Jackson at 312-988-5766.
  West Publishing (Eagan, Minn.) is also accepting
  nominations for its Excellence in Private Law
  Librarianship Award. Librarians who have
  distinguished themselves in managing and providing
  effective access to information are eligible for
  consideration. For more information contact Todd
  Daubenberger at 612-687-5638.
  
       o Kudos to LOMAR's publisher. The Institute on
  Management and Administration's (IOMA) Web site was
  recently described by Inc. magazine as "by far the
  best business-resource site we've ever seen," and
  was cited by PC Week for its "comprehensive listing
  of business information." For access, point to
  http//www.ioma/com/ioma or e-mail Kathy Fitzgerald
  at Kathie@ ingress.com for help. 
  
       o Remember client confidentiality when
  outsourcing. Firms must make a reasonable effort to
  ensure that the outside companies they retain know
  when confidential material is involved, cautions a
  recent opinion by the ABA's Standing Committee on
  Ethics and Professional Responsibility. Formal
  Opinion 95-398, issued in response to a request to
  consider the implications of a firm's arrangement
  with a maintenance company which had been given
  access to client files on its local area network,
  recommends setting up written agreements to prohibit
  outside service providers from disclosing client
  information they might see. 
  
       o Free help with new ERISA guidelines. The 1995
  Guide to ERISA Reporting and Disclosure is being
  offered by the Human Resource Advisory Group of
  Coopers & Lybrand LLP to help those in search of the
  latest information on ERISA's new reporting and
  disclosure requirements. Copies are available free
  of charge by contacting Coopers & Lybrand
  Publications at 212-536-3257.
  
       o Partners specializing in administrative law
  command top dollar. And with their average annual
  compensation of $237,714, these practitioners
  outpaced their peers in other practice areas,
  according to Altman Weil Pensa's 1995 Survey of Law
  Firm Economics (Newtown Square, Pa.; 610-359-9900).
  
       o New alternatives for NALFMA membership. In
  response to recommendations that it review its
  membership qualifications, benefits, and costs, the
  National Law Firm Marketing Association (NALFMA;
  Chicago, 312-245-1592) has added new "firm" and
  "individual" membership categories. Firm membership
  has its advantages. With this latest option, if a
  marketer leaves a firm, his or her rights of NALFMA
  membership are transferrable to the new
  firm_assuming it continues to pay annual dues and
  provides the association with written notice. In
  addition, members of the same firm, regardless of
  geographic location, may also join at a reduced
  rate. Cost: $275 per year for the firm's member
  representative and $150 for additional members. A
  $50 initiation fee is assessed for each new member.  
  
       o LOMAR online. Subscribers in need of, say,
  that LOMAR article on partner billing rates that ran
  back in December can now access it on their
  computers. Two months of back issues are currently
  available through NEWSNET and new issues will be
  added soon after they are published. For information
  on this online service, which also offers a number
  of other legal publications, contact: NEWSNET, 945
  Haverford Rd., Bryn Mawr, PA 19010; 800-334-0329.
  Coming soon: A LOMAR archive on WESTLAW. Users will
  also be able to access back issues of LOMAR's sister
  publications: Compensation and Benefits for Law
  Offices and Partner's Report for Law Firm Owners.

NICOTINE PATCH CLASS SUIT ALLEGES PERSONAL INJURY, SD CA RULES

     U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez of the Southern
District of California on Sept. 22 dismissed the RICO-based class
complaint lodged by nicotine patch users against the major
American tobacco concerns, finding their nicotine addiction
claims to be, at bottom, for personal injury, and therefore
incompensable under the statute (Allman et al. v. Philip Morris
Inc. et al., SD CA, No. 94-0504-IEG (CM).

     The plaintiffs had argued that they were not seeking
recovery for injury to their person, such as for pain and
suffering, emotional distress or increased risk of cancer, but
rather only for the money they were forced to spend to break
their addiction to cigarettes -- an addiction, they added, that
the defendant tobacco companies caused.  They asserted that these
damages constituted statutory injury to property.

     "Although theoretically it is not always easy to distinguish
a personal injury from an injury to property," Judge Gonzalez
wrote, "for the purposes of bringing an action under RICO the
courts have been clear that even the economic consequences of
personal injuries are not compensable under RICO....

     "[A]lthough plaintiffs characterize the injury as pecuniary
and thus an injury to their property," she continued, "the Court
is unable to ignore that the core injury alleged in the complaint
is addiction to nicotine."  The judge noted that all courts faced
with the issue have recognized that expenses stemming from
personal injury are not recoverable under RICO.  "Had Congress
intended to create a federal treble damages remedy for cases
involving such claims, it could have enacted a statute referring
to injury generally, without any restrictive language," she
wrote.

     The judge found that the plaintiffs had cited to no cases
that allow recovery of medical expenses under RICO.  She also
rejected the claimants' argument that money is considered
"property" under California law, and that expenditures for
nicotine patches therefore constituted injury to property.
"[T]he Court will not adopt a state interpretation of 'property'
that will contravene Congress' intent in enacting RICO," Judge
Gonzalez stated.
               The defendant tobacco companies' July 15 dismissal motion
had also asserted that the plaintiffs failed to allege that they
were injured by the use or investment of the money the companies
supposedly received from alleged racketeering conduct, as
required under RICO Section 1962(a).  The plaintiffs had rejoined
in their Aug. 15 response that they adequately alleged injury
under Section 1962(a) by asserting that the defendants'
investment of the proceeds of their cigarettes sales, which
occurred due to defendants' racketeering activity, caused injury
to the class.

     The plaintiffs are represented by William S. Lerach, Patrick
J. Coughlin and Randi D. Weinberger of Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes & Lerach in San Diego and by Melvyn I. Weiss and Patricia
Hynes in the firm's New York office.

     Counsel for the defendants include Maurice A. Leiter, Andrew
C. Callari and Richard A. Ward of Arnold & Porter in Washington,
D.C.; Christopher Norgaard of the Los Angeles office of Mudge

9TH CIR.: PATIENTS CAN'T SHOW INJURY FROM OVERBILLING SCHEME

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 19 affirmed
a Nevada district court's dismissal of RICO claims lodged by a
group of hospital patients against a doctor and hospital for
conspiring to overbill their health insurers, finding that the
plaintiffs failed to demonstrate concrete financial loss (Steele
et al. v. Hospital Corp. of America. et al., 9th Cir., No. 92-
17035).

     Dr. Stuart Wyckoff, director of the adolescent psychiatric
care unit at Truckee Meadows Hospital, was among the parties sued
by four former patients and their parents.  The plaintiffs
alleged that Wyckoff and the hospital conspired to bill their
health care carriers for services that went unprovided, or were
inappropriate.

     The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada granted
summary judgment to the defense, determining that the plaintiffs
lacked standing.  The lower court reasoned that the insurers, and
not the plaintiffs themselves, were injured by the fraudulent
billing.  The trial court further found that the plaintiffs
failed to show that they paid out any money of their own as a
result of the scheme.

     In affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs'
assertions of injury due to depletion of insurance benefits.  One
parent asserted that he could have used some of the benefits for
himself; the panel rejoined that he had "not described a concrete
financial loss, but rather a speculative injury, contingent on
actually seeking medical care for himself....  [S]peculative
injuries to not serve to confer standing under RICO, unless they
become concrete and actual."

     Another parent claImed that he had to cover the entire bill
when his son was admitted to another facility because of
exhausted coverage.  "[P]roof of this payment would be
insufficient to confer RICO standing," the Ninth Circuit replied,
"because it alone does not show that the payment was caused by
the alleged billing scheme..., as distinguished from some other
cause."

     While the record revealed direct payments made by two of the
patients to the hospital, the panel found that the record "does
not reveal what these payments were for and there is no
explanation of how those charges were related to the allegedly
fraudulent overbilling scheme."

     The Ninth Circuit also affirmed the lower court's
application of the same reasoning in granting summary judgment on
the Nevada state RICO allegations.

     C. Frederick Pinkerton, Reno, NV, represents the appellants.

     Mark H. Lynch of Covington & Burling, Washington, DC, and
Theodore D. Gamboa of Osborne & Gamboa, Reno, represent the
appellees.

CO. TO HIGH CT.: CUSTOMER BILLING SCHEME DIDN'T INJURE COMPETITOR

     The telecommunications company whose summary judgment on a
competitor's RICO claims was overturned by the Fourth Circuit
last March on Aug. 19 filed a petition for writ of certiorari
with the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate panel
improperly found a causal link between the petitioner's alleged
fraud on its customers and the injury claimed by the respondent
(Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. et al. v. Mid Atlantic
Telecom Inc., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-319).

     The petitioner Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. (nee
Long Distance Services Inc.) and respondent Mid Atlantic Telecom
Inc. make wholesale purchases of time on the transmission lines
of common carriers and resell them to their customers.  After a
1986 systems error caused the loss of a weekend's worth of data
concerning customer use, LDS President Richard J. Rice
commissioned the drafting of a computer program that would
randomly pad the length of its customers' billable calls.

     Mid Atlantic sued LDS and Rice in the District of Maryland
in 1992, arguing that LDS continued to utilize the program even
after its losses had been recouped.  Mid Atlantic asserted that
the program enabled LDS to offer artificially lower rates, and
thereby entice away Mid Atlantic's customers, when in fact it was
overbilling said customers.  The plaintiff alleged to have lost
revenues from engaging in a pricing war, as well as customers.

     The trial court granted summary judgment to LDS, finding no
proximate cause linking the alleged conduct could not have
proximately caused the claimed injuries per the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1992 ruling in Holmes v. SIPC.  In reversing and
remanding for further discovery, the Fourth Circuit noted that
the complaint alleged Mid Atlantic's elimination as a competitor
as an end goal of the alleged scheme.  The appellate panel stated
that its findings were consistent with Holmes, noting that Mid
Atlantic was not seeking to vindicate the rights of its ex-
customers, and that Mid Atlantic's claimed injuries were not
derivative of its ex-customers.

     In its certiorari petition, LDS asserted that the underlying
predicate acts alleged "are the use of the mails and wires to
commit a fraud....  These allegations, plainly, are directed
exclusively toward the users of long distance service, the
customers.  There are no allegations that LDS intended to deceive
Mid Atlantic or that Mid Atlantic was defrauded by the fraudulent
billing practice."

     Regardless of whether it intended this alleged fraud on the
customers to also harm the respondent competitively, argued the
petitioner, Mid Atlantic's injury was not directly caused by the
fraud.  "Mid Atlantic's injury is a byproduct, whether intended
or not, of the injury to the customers," LDS argued.

     "RICO, as construed by this court, requires a cognizable
connection between the offending acts and the claimed injury,"
the petitioner contended.  The respondent alleged that one of the
purposes of the scheme was to steal Mid Atlantic's customers; the
petitioner rejoined that "unfair competition of that nature,
however unacceptable it is deemed under state law, is not
prohibited by the federal mail fraud statute."
               The petitioner asserted that "RICO does not, and was
never intended to, prohibit anticompetitive conduct, even in its more
virulent forms, without more.  RICO was aimed at a different
evil."

     Edgar N. James and Martha Walfoort of Guerrieri, Edmond &
James, Washington, DC, submitted the certiorari petition on
behalf of Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. and Richard J.
Rice.

     Harry Martin Rifkin and Franklin T. Caudill of Semmes, Bowen
& Semmes, Baltimore, represent Mid Atlantic Telecom Inc.

ND IL REFUSES TO DISMISS FORCED-PLACED INSURANCE CAR LOAN CLAIMS

     U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo of the Northern District
of Illinois on Aug. 11 refused to dismiss the RICO claims of
three car loan borrowers against First of America Bank Champion
N.A., sustaining the plaintiffs' allegations that the lender
obtained unnecessary forced-placed insurance on their vehicles
for the purpose of imposing additional loan obligations (Bermudez
et al. v.  First of America Bank Champion N.A., ND IL, No. 93 C
3653).

     The three plaintiffs had each purchased an auto financed via
a motor vehicle retail installment sales contract.  Each sales
contract was immediately assigned to Champion.  The sales
contracts' terms required the borrowers to keep the vehicles
insured against loss or damage, and authorized Champion to obtain
loss/damage insurance if the borrower failed to do so.  The cost
of any such "forced-placed" insurance would be charged to the
borrowers' loan balance.

     In their cases, the plaintiffs urged, Champion, without
authorization, procured insurance that would also cover any
default on their loan obligations.  All three of the plaintiffs
here refused to pay the extra premiums that were added to their
balances due and all had their cars repossessed by the lender.
Their claimed injuries included loss of their vehicles, injury to
their credit and the creation of fictitious indebtedness.

     Champion never provided the borrowers with copies of the
forced-placed policies, and nothing in the "certificate of
insurance" transmitted to each plaintiff suggested that the
insurance also covered default.  The policies also covered
imposition of mechanic's liens on the collateral, and against the
borrower absconding with or secreting the collateral.

     The plaintiffs' complaint was grounded in RICO, the Truth in
Lending Act and numerous state counts.  Champion made multiple
arguments in its bid to dismiss the RICO claim, including lack of
RICO "injury," lack of proximate causation, running of the
statute of limitations, failure to adequately plead fraud,
failure to allege pattern, and immunity under the McCarran-
Ferguson Act.

     Judge Castillo disposed of the McCarran-Ferguson argument
first, concluding that the defendant's unauthorized procurement
of coverage (and passing such costs along) was not part of the
"business of insurance."  The judge found that this practice does
not involve the transferring or spreading of Champion's risk, nor
is it an integral part of the policy relationship between carrier
and policyholder.  Nor were the challenged practices limited to
entities in the insurance industry, the court noted.

     In addressing Champion's RICO standing arguments, the court
noted that the lender "does not dispute that repossession of
plaintiffs' vehicles and payment of money for unauthorized
premiums constitute compensable injuries under RICO."  The judge
rejected Champion's contentions that the plaintiffs suffered no
injury because they did not pay the additional premiums.

     He further rejected the lender's assertion that the car
repossessions were not proximately caused by its conduct.  One
plaintiff had not paid any insurance premiums, much less the
added charges, Champion argued; another was in default for an
amount beyond the premiums.  Judge Castillo found that the
present record "does not permit a parcelling of charges [into]
authorized and unauthorized components," and that the other
plaintiff could possibly "establish facts proving that Champion
would not have repossessed his vehicle if not for the fact that
his outstanding balance was so great."

     The judge rejected the lenders' contentions that the
borrowers in fact benefited from the additional coverage, or that
the coverage would not have been forced-placed but for the
plaintiffs' failure to obtain their own insurance.  The
borrowers, the judge noted, did not complain about the
defendant's procurement of authorized insurance.

     In turning to the time-bar argument, the court noted the
plaintiffs' contentions that their claims accrued in February
1993, when they obtained documents showing that Champion had
procured the unauthorized insurance.  Champion asserted that the
claims began to run in 1988-1989, when the borrowers received
their "certificates of insurance."

     Judge Castillo refused to find that the certificates put the
plaintiffs on notice.  "The statement that the certificate is a
condensed version of the policy and that there are additional
terms and conditions does not suggest to the ordinary consumer
that there is coverage beyond that described in the certificate,"
he wrote.

     He also found that the plaintiffs' authorization in the
contracts did not void their ability to allege fraud.  After
reviewing the documents, the judge refused to hold as a matter of
law that they "authorized Champion to purchase insurance in
addition to that for damage or loss to the vehicles."

     The court also found the pleadings to sufficiently allege
pattern.  The allegations, noted the judge, satisfied the
relatedness inquiry by claiming a course of conduct running at
least five years; the possibility of thousands of victims;
similar injuries (repossession, overpayments); and multiple
fraudulent uses of the mails.

     Continuity was also demonstrated, found the judge, by the
allegations that these were the lender's "normal ongoing
practices" and that such practices had occurred for several
years.

     The judge refused to dismiss the TILA claims as time-barred
under the statute's one-year limitations period, finding the
plaintiffs to have sufficiently averred fraudulent concealment.
The court also rejected the substantive TILA challenge.  Judge
Castillo found that if the default coverage was unauthorized,
then the charges for the coverage would not constitute a charge
for actual unanticipated default, but a finance charge subject to
the statute.

     The judge ordered the submission of a motion for class
certification by Sept. 1 and a defense response by Sept. 29.

11TH CIR. ADOPTS PERSON/ENTERPRISE DISTINCTION IN REVISED OPINION

     The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 modified
its April 1994 ruling that permitted members of the United
Steelworkers of America to bring RICO claims against their union
and USX Corp. over a swap of labor concessions for perks to union
negotiators.

     While the modification did not invalidate the claims of the
plaintiffs here, the 11th Circuit has ostensibly voided its 1982
ruling in U.S. v. Hartley, which had rejected the commonly-held
requirement that a defendant entity cannot be both a RICO
"person" and "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) (Cox et
al. v. Administrator United States Steel & Carnegie et al., 11th
Cir., Nos. 91-7215, 92-6218).

     The litigation, which was brought in the Northern District
of Alabama by 38 former union employees of USX's Fairfield mill,
stemmed from a 1983 collective bargaining agreement between USX
and the union.  Leading the negotiations for the Steelworkers
were District 36 director Thermon Phillips and district sub-
director E.B. Rich, both former USX employees.  As alleged,
Phillips and Rich sought to have USX grant them (and other ex-USX
employee/union reps) retroactive leaves of absence, in order to
become eligible for USX pensions.  The negotiators purportedly
made any labor concessions contingent on their receiving
pensions.

     The CBA that was struck contained considerable concessions,
including the elimination of 500 jobs, the abolition of local
working conditions rules, and the dismissal of all pending
grievances and complaints.  USX subsequently amended corporate
policy to grant indefinite retroactive leaves of absence for
employees who had left to work for the union.

     While Phillips, Rich and four other union reps (the
"Fairfield Six") began receiving pension payments, no other
potential beneficiaries under the policy change did.  After
rumors of the Fairfield Six's arrangement surfaced, potential
beneficiaries made demand on USX's pension fund.  USX, Rich and
Phillips were ultimately convicted under 29 U.S.C. Section 186
for their bargaining activities.

     The Northern District of Alabama had granted summary
judgment to the defense on the plaintiffs' RICO and Labor
Management Relations Act claims.  The trial court determined that
the employees did not demonstrate any causal link between the
negotiations that led to the pension grandfathering and their
claimed injuries.

     The 11th Circuit reversed last April 5.  The panel
determined the plaintiffs' RICO claims valid after exhaustive
review, finding that the employees had properly alleged pattern
and that a jury issue could be made that Rich and Phillips'
pursuit of their self-interests resulted in some dollar amount of
concessions in the CBA.  The appellate court also found that the
plaintiffs could pursue arguments under theories of respondeat
superior and aiding/abetting to establish the union's RICO
liability for the negotiators' acts.  The defense sought
rehearing and rehearing en banc from the 11th Circuit.

     While the panel rejected the defense petitions in all other
respects, it altered the text of Section II.B.1.b.  In its
earlier ruling, the court had rejected USX's argument that it
could not be both a 1962(c) "person" and "enterprise" by simply
citing back to Hartley.  The revised portions of the opinion
removed all citations to Hartley.

     The revised opinion found that the plaintiffs' claims did in
fact make a person/enterprise distinction.  "[T]he plaintiffs
have alleged only that USX conducted the affairs of the Fairfield
Works, the Union, District 36 and the Fund through a pattern of
racketeering activity -- not that USX conducted its own affairs
through a pattern of such activity."

     The panel also determined that the pension fund was an
enterprise distinct from USX.  "The pension fund has a separate
corporate existence; it is a nonprofit membership corporation.
Its existence is not dependent upon USX....  Although both USX
and its employees have a role in the pension fund, the role of
each is distinct from the respective role each has in the
corporation itself."

     The amendments also eliminated all reference to Hartley from
the context of its vicarious liability overview at
Section II.B.3.a.

7TH CIR.: POWER TOOL DISPARAGEMENT CLAIMS FAIL TO PLEAD FRAUD

     The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 13
affirmed the dismissal of the RICO-based trade disparagement
claims brought by a Taiwanese power tool maker and its American
distributor against Makita Corp. and its subsidiaries, agreeing
that the averments of fraud fail to meet the particularity
requirements of FRCP 9(b) (Jepson Inc. et al. v. Makita Corp. et
al., 7th Cir., No. 93-1606).

     The action is rooted in an April 1988 complaint to the
International Trade Commission by the defendants (collectively,
"Makita") alleging that the distributor Jepson Inc. and some 30
other parties had engaged in unfair trade practices with respect
to the importation and marketing of Taiwan-made power tools.
That August, the ITC began an investigation into possible
breaches of the Tariff Act of 1930.

     While the investigation ensued, Makita allegedly contacted
Jepson customers, apprising them of the ITC activity and
disparaging Jepson's products as low-quality, infringing goods
that would be ordered removed from their shelves.  Makita also
arranged the placement of stories in the trade press concerning
the investigation and predicting that Makita would prevail in the
matter.  One story identified Jepson and the co-plaintiff
manufacturer Ko Shin Electric and Machinery Co. Ltd. as two of
the companies that Makita was seeking to block.  In July 1989,
the ITC found in favor of all but one of the companies named to
Makita's complaint.

     Jepson and Ko Shin filed a RICO complaint with the Northern
District of Illinois in 1990, asserting that Makita's acts were
part of a conspiracy dating back to 1986 calculated to drive
Taiwanese power tool manufacturers from the market.  The
plaintiffs alleged substantial sales losses over 1986-1990, along
with erosion of market position, customer base, and potential for
growth.  The plaintiffs sought a base recovery of $10 million
plus treble damages.

     The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice on
various grounds; the Seventh Circuit's affirmance focused on the
lower court's FRCP 9(b) analysis.  With respect to the phone
calls and mailings to Jepson customers and the trade press, the
Northern District found the plaintiffs' allegations to "fail to
provide any indications of who made the communications or when
they took place."
               The lower court also determined that the plaintiffs'
allegations were not within the scope of the wire and mail fraud
statutes.  As construed by the Seventh Circuit, the Northern
District "thought that the gist of the alleged scheme -- to
disparage Jepson's products and frighten away its customers --
did not fall under the rubric of fraud."  While the statutes are
concerned with property rights, the plaintiffs "had not
identified  damage to a cognizable property interest."

     The Seventh Circuit's analysis opened by finding
"considerable persuasive force" to this latter argument.  The
panel declined to address the issue at length, however, because
it agreed with the lower court's 9(b) findings as grounds for
affirmance.  The panel found the allegations concerning the
communications to Jepson's customers to be "the most glaringly
deficient....

     "Although the amended complaint identifies the general
nature of the purported misrepresentations made to these
customers," the panel continued, "no detail beyond that is
supplied."  The court found that there was no issue present as to
whether the facts were in the sole possession of the defense.
"[E]ven if they learned of the contacts through other sources,"
wrote the panel, "they have as much access as the defendants to
the customers who can flesh out the circumstances of the mailings
and wire communications involved."

     While finding the allegations concerning the communications
with the trade press "not flawed to the same degree," the
appellate panel still found the complaint void of detail
concerning the content of any such communication.  From the face
of the articles that appeared in the trades, the Seventh Circuit
wrote, "we detect only one or two statements that might be
characterized as misrepresentations."

     The panel rejected the plaintiffs' allegations concerning
the article that implicated them in the ITC investigation.  "We
do not see what is false or misleading about such a statement,"
wrote the court.  "Jepson and Ko Shin were, so far as we can
determine, targets of Makita's complaint, and the complaint did
seek an order of the kind described."

     The court found the statements made by Makita's counsel to
the trades "fall within the range of opinions predictions that
parties and their attorneys routinely make while legal
proceedings are underway."  The references made in the trades to
"rip-offs" and "poor-quality copies" of Makita products did not
rise to fraud, stated the panel; Makita did obtain a conviction
against one manufacturer, indicating there were in fact inferior
copies of their products in circulation.

     "Labels like 'poor quality,' 'cheap,' and 'lookalike' may be
offensive to the companies whose products are being described,"
the panel concluded, "but they are also inherently subjective
expressions that are ill-suited as the basis for mail and wire
fraud claims."

4TH CIR.: PTL SHARES ARE 'SECURITIES,' DEFENSE RICO WIN AFFIRMED

     The Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 23
overturned the directed verdict granted to Jim Bakker on the
federal securities fraud claims levied against him by a class of
subscribers to "lifetime partnerships" in PTL, determining that
the partnership interests constitute "securities" under federal
law.  The balance of the North Carolina federal court and jury's
findings, including Bakker's liability for common law fraud and
the defense verdict on federal and state RICO claims, were upheld
(Teague et al. v. Bakker et al., 4th Cir., Nos. 91-2101, 91-2120,
91-2121, 91-2122).

     The "partnerships" solicited by the former televangelist's
organization between 1984-1987 promised benefits that included
annual lodging at PTL's Heritage Village theme park.  Bakker sold
roughly 153,000 partnerships that included lodging benefits,
raising at least $158 million.  The partnerships were oversold;
most of the proposed additional facilities at the park went
unconstructed, and the partnership investments went to PTL's
operating expenses and the support of Bakker's lifestyle.  Most
members never received the promised lodging benefits.  Bakker was
criminally convicted for this conduct.

     A class suit was lodged in late 1987 in the Western District
of North Carolina, naming Bakker; PTL accountants Deloitte,
Haskin & Sells; and various individual PTL principals.  The
complaint was grounded in federal and state securities law,
federal and state RICO, the South Carolina Timeshare Act
("SCTSA"), common law fraud and common law negligence.

     The trial judge granted a directed verdict on the securities
fraud claims, determining the partnership interests not to be
statutory "securities."  The jury determined Bakker to be liable
on the common-law fraud count and found for the defense in all
other respects.

     In overturning the directed verdict on the securities
claims, the Fourth Circuit found that the case turned on the
third inquiry established by SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (U.S. Sup. Ct.
1946) as to whether the partnerships are statutory "investment
contracts, e.g. whether the investment was made "with an
expectation of profits 'solely' from the efforts of others."

     The lower court found that the investors were attracted
solely to acquire lodging, and not for a financial return on the
investment.  The appellate panel noted that PTL's promotional
materials "represented that the value of the privileges lifetime
partners would receive far exceeded the $1,000 LTP purchase
price."  The court found that the defense representations "can be
read to suggest that LTP purchasers would receive an economic
benefit in the form of discounted lodging privileges at PTL
facilities."

     The defense pointed to the testimony of class members who
stated that they purchased with personal use as their primary
motivation; the panel found such evidence "cannot be dispositive
in the face of evidence that the promoter of the scheme in
question marketed the scheme by emphasizing the potential for
profit."

     The appellees contended that the partnerships are not
transferrable, and that the partners could therefore never
realize capital appreciation.  The Fourth Circuit found there to
be record evidence that the partnerships could be transferred on
an annual basis.

     The panel affirmed the dismissal of the claims against
Deloitte, Haskin for aiding and abetting Bakker's alleged federal
securities violations, finding this theory invalidated by the
Supreme Court's 1994 opinion in Central Bank of Denver v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver.  The panel found Central Bank
persuasive, if not dispositive, in affirming the rejection of the
plaintiffs' comparable state counts.

     The panel also agreed that the partnerships were not
"vacation time sharing plans" for the purposes of the state
timeshare act.  The Fourth Circuit found no abuse of discretion
by the court below in denying new trial on either the claims
against the accountants on the aiding and abetting of Bakker's
common-law fraud, or on the plaintiffs' federal and state RICO
claims.

     The plaintiffs had asserted on appeal that the jury was
improperly allowed to decide if Bakker had committed the alleged
RICO predicates.  They argued that Bakker's criminal convictions
collaterally estopped any such debate issue as to whether he had
committed the RICO predicates; the panel found that this argument
had never been proffered below, and was inappropriate here.

     The partners also argued that the RICO jury instructions
were flawed in three respects.  They asserted that the
instructions erroneously referred to RICO predicates as "crimes";
the panel found this to be harmless error, as the trial court at
no time imposed a "beyond reasonable doubt" proof burden.

     The court had instructed the jury that the North Carolina
RICO statute requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The
plaintiffs found this proper with respect to Bakker's primary
violation, but erroneous with respect to Deloitte, Haskin's
aiding and abetting of the primary violation.  The panel found
harmless error here as well, because Bakker was exonerated on the
primary violation.

               The plaintiffs lastly challenged the instruction
concerning 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(b).  They contended that the
instruction wrongly required the jury to find that Bakker acquired an
equity ownership in the enterprise.  The court found that, in its
entirety, the instruction ultimately required a finding that Bakker
had "actual day-to-day involvement in the management and operation of
PTL."

     The panel rejected Bakker's appeal on the fraud count, as
well as the attempts of Deloitte, Haskin and Bakker aide David A.
Taggart to recoup their costs from the plaintiffs.

ND CA DISMISSES SECURITIES FRAUD ACTION AGAINST OMNITRITION

     Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California on July 25 dismissed a
securities action against Omnitrition International Inc. and its
top officials, finding that the company is not an illegal pyramid
sales scheme as alleged by the plaintiffs  (In re Omnitrition
International Inc. Securities Litigation, ND CA, MDL No. 965,
No. C-92-4133-SBA).

     Judge Armstrong granted a motion for summary judgment filed
on May 11 by defendants Omnitrition, Jim Fobair, Roger Daley and
Charles Ragus, holding that the structure of Omnitrition's system
does not lend itself to the definition of an illegal pyramid
scheme.

     "As a threshold matter," the judge said, "the participants
in the company, [Independent Marketing Agents], do not pay money
to obtain sales and/or recruiting rights....  [T]here is no
charge for joining the company.  Once the application is
approved, the participant obtains the right to buy Omnitrition
products at a 20% discount, and the right to sell Omnitrition
products."

     Plaintiffs in this action, individuals who obtained
distributorships with Omnitrition between 1989 and 1992, filed a
complaint against the defendants alleging violations of federal
securities laws, RICO and state fraud laws in the creation,
promotion and marketing of Omnitrition and its distributorships.
Omnitrition allegedly markets a line of health food products.
However, plaintiffs claim that Omnitrition did not engage in or
encourage retail sale of these products.  Rather, plaintiffs
state that Omnitrition actively recruited distributors of the
products, who would in turn be encouraged to recruit more
distributors.

     However, Judge Armstrong said the recruitment of others into
a program does not constitute a pyramid scheme, at least not
until the recruits make any retail sales.

     "More significantly," the judge said, "an IMA does not
obtain the right to earn rewards for recruiting other
participants into the scheme that are unrelated to product sales.
A participant in Omnitrition does not receive any payment or
reward for merely recruiting others into the program.  These new
recruits must make retail sales.  If the recruiter has achieved a
sufficient sales volume to qualify for overrides and/or bonuses,
and the new recruits make retail sales, the recruiter receives a
payment from Omnitrition based upon a percentage of the retail
sales of his downline.

     "Thus," the judge said, "Omnitrition provides rewards for
recruiting participants that are directly related to product
sales.  In fact, the reward is conditional on product sales, and
the amount of the award is based upon the amount of product sales
that occur."

     Judge Armstrong also ruled that the defendants' alleged
misleading statements and omissions are not actionable under the
federal securities laws.  The judge cited the Ninth Circuit's
ruling in In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig., 886 F.2d 1109, 1113
(9th Cir. 1989).  In Apple, the appeals court said that a
projection or statement of belief contains at least three
implicit factual assertions:  (1) that the statement is genuinely
believed, (2) that there is a reasonable basis for that belief
and (3) that the speaker is not aware of any undisclosed facts
tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of the statement.  A
projection or statement of belief may be actionable to the extent
that one of these implied factual assertions is inaccurate.

     "Plaintiffs have challenged every statement [of the
defendants] on the ground that Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme
that was destined to collapse, and that each defendant knew this
to be true," Judge Armstrong said.  "However,...Omnitrition does
not meet the legal definition of an illegal pyramid sales scheme.
Accordingly, plaintiffs' claims that Omnitrition is inherently
destined to collapse are unsupportable.

     "Moreover," the judge said, "defendants have each submitted
declarations in which they maintain that they genuinely believed
and continue to believe that every statement they made is true.
Defendants have therefore met the first prong of the Apple test."

     The judge also noted that each defendant testified that he
had a reasonable basis for believing the statements to be true.
"Plaintiffs have not forwarded any evidence or argument
suggesting that defendants' bases for believing their statements
to be true were unreasonable, thus, defendants have met the
second prong of the Apple test," she said.

     "Finally," the judge said, "plaintiffs have not forwarded
any evidence suggesting that any defendant was aware of
undisclosed facts tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of
each statement.  Thus, the third prong of the Apple test is met."

               In addition, Judge Armstrong found that the
plaintiffs have not sufficiently proven their allegations that the
defendants engaged in RICO predicate acts.  "Plaintiffs maintain that
since they have proven Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme, they need not
prove specific intent," the judge said.  "However,...plaintiffs have
failed to demonstrate or otherwise establish a triable issue of fact
concerning whether Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme.  As there is
otherwise no evidence of specific intent on the part of the
defendants to defraud anyone, plaintiffs' RICO claims are fatally
deficient."

SD NY: BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS DON'T REQUIRE FRCP 9(b) REVIEW

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Aug. 17 refused to dismiss the RICO action brought
by CNBC Inc. against a commercial printer that it claims
corrupted an ex-employee into arranging inflated compensation for
the defendants' services.  The judge rejected the defense's
contentions that the alleged predicate acts of commercial bribery
must be pleaded with FRCP 9(b) particularity (CNBC Inc. v.
Alvarado et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 2261 (JFK)).

     The cable programmer alleged that in a period spanning 1989-
1993, Avalon Group Associates Ltd. and its president, Robert
Alvarado Jr., conspired with then-CNBC employee Joyce Gibney to
embezzle from the plaintiff.  Over 1991-1993, Gibney received
some $111,000 in bribes and kickbacks to direct some $3 million
of CNBC business to the defendants, the plaintiff alleged; Gibney
was also supposedly named to Alvarado's will.

     Gibney also purportedly gave the defendants inside
information on CNBC's bidding process; the plaintiff alleged that
this resulted the submission of falsely inflated invoices that
overbilled for over $500,000.  The plaintiff seeks this amount,
plus $100,000 for the loss of Gibney's loyal services and for
compensatory damages, plus an additional $2 million in punitives.
The complaint listed 18 faxed communications as predicate acts of
wire fraud and also claimed the bribery of Gibney as a predicate.

     In rejecting the defense's dismissal motion, the court
rejected Avalon's argument that the bribery allegations must
comport with FRCP 9(b).  The defendants argued that the stricter
standard should apply, because the damage from the alleged
bribery stemmed solely from the fraudulent invoices.
"[P]laintiff," the judge rejoined, "alleges that it was damaged
not only by the invoices, but also by the loss of a loyal
employee."

     The judge found the bribery allegations sufficiently pleaded
under the standard of FRCP 8(a).  The allegations of the fraud
predicates were determined to be sufficient under FRCP 9(b).
While acknowledging that CNBC failed to specify the content of
either the invoices or the faxes, the court noted that the
defendants and Gibney are the only persons with actual knowledge
as to their content.  Noting that the plaintiff will need further
discovery, and had established motive and opportunity for fraud,
the judge refused to dismiss.

     Nathaniel H. Akerman of Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &
Geraldson, New York, represents the plaintiff.

     Arthur J. Golder III of Golder & Golder, Trumansburg, NY,
represents the defendants.

ND IL ALLOWS 1962 (c),(d) CLAIMS AGAINST POWER BUYING CLUB

     U.S. District Judge Harry D. Leinenwebber of the Northern
District of Illinois on Aug. 17 declined to dismiss the RICO
fraud class claims lodged under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) and (d)
by a member of a consumer "power buying" club against the club's
organizers and operators.  The plaintiff's allegations under
Section 1962(a) were dismissed for failure to demonstrate
investment injury (Crawford v. Payne et al., ND IL, No. 93 C
7303).

     Charlie Crawford lodged the instant suit against the
operators of the Combined Purchasing Association Inc. Buyers
Club, which induced memberships by representing that it could
obtain merchandise at substantially below-retail prices.
Memberships were solicited via at-home demonstrations and follow-
up calls; the required membership fee was upwards of $1000.
Crawford alleged that the defendants sought to reap these fees,
while concurrently defeating the efforts of the members to obtain
merchandise at discount prices.

     The plaintiff alleged three separate clusters of defendants:
the individual "designers" who set up the overall enterprise; the
individual "operators" who implemented the scheme on a day-to-day
basis; and corporate defendants that acted in direct concert with
the designers.

     In reviewing the defense's dismissal motion, the judge first
addressed the assertion that Crawford's predicate fraud
allegations failed to plead a scheme to defraud.  The court found
that the tiers of operation alleged by the plaintiff, if proven,
would "constitute an 'elaborate attempt at concealment.'"   The
judge also found the defendants' sales pitches as alleged by the
plaintiffs constituted "specific misrepresentations or half-
truths." He also determined that the allegations demonstrated
scienter and a sufficient link between the alleged fraud and the
use of the mails and wires.

     In rejecting Crawford's 1962(a) count, Judge Leinenwebber
found him to be "in effect...claiming that defendants reinvested
racketeering proceeds into the entities it created to operate the
Buyers Club."  The court cited to the Seventh Circuit's April
ruling in Vicom v. Harbridge Merchant Services (see Civil RICO
LR, April 1994, P. 9,484) for the principle that mere
reinvestment of proceeds, without proximate causation of injury,
is insufficient to create 1962(a) standing.

     The judge denied the defense's attempt to dismiss the
1962(c) count, however.  He found the fraud allegations to be
pleaded with sufficient FRCP 9(b) particularity, noting that
Crawford included a copy of the Buying Club sales pitch
materials, and notified each defendant as to his role in the
alleged fraud.  The court also determined the plaintiff to have
sufficiently identified an enterprise comprised of the three
clusters of defendants.

     Judge Leinenwebber further ruled that Crawford had
sufficiently alleged pattern.  The relationship prong was
satisfied, he found, as each prospective plaintiff was defrauded
by the same misrepresentations.  The judge also noted that the
Buyers' Club's activities are allegedly ongoing, and ruled that
open-ended continuity was therefore established.

     The judge found the conspiracy allegations under 1962(d)
sufficiently pleaded.  He denied the defendants' bid to strike
any claims accruing prior to Dec. 3, 1989 (four years before the
filing of Crawford's suit), as time-barred.

2ND CIR. PROPERLY FOUND NO DAMAGES, MILKENS ARGUE TO HIGH COURT

     Michael and Lowell Milken on Aug. 17 responded to the
certiorari petition lodged by investors in the restructuring of
Ivan Boesky & Co. whose federal securities and RICO claims were
denied by the Second Circuit, arguing that the appellate panel
was correct in finding the petitioners "had no damages in light
of their 100% recoupment (plus a profit)" (Commercial Union
Assurance Co. et al. v. Milken et al., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-
153).

     In 1986, the plaintiff investors bought $10.5 million worth
of partnership interests in Ivan F. Boesky & Co., L.P.  The
plaintiffs opted into the March 1987 lawsuit against Boesky and
debt underwriter Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; that suit was
amended in 1989 to name the Milkens, who had worked with Boesky
on the reorganization as principals of DBL, as defendants.

     After the respondents were brought into suit, the investors
began to cash distributions from Boesky & Co.'s liquidation
trustee.  By April 1992, the petitioners had received
distributions totaling $12.047 million, or over 114% of their
original investment.  The petitioners opted out of the March 1992
global settlement that the Milkens arranged with Boesky
investors, and brought an amended complaint against the
respondents.

               The Milkens obtained summary judgment from the Southern
District of New York in May 1993.  The trial court's finding of
failure to plead compensable damages was affirmed last March by
the Second Circuit, which wrote that "damages as compensation
under RICO Section 1964(c) for injury to property must, under the
familiar rule of law, place appellants in the same position they
would have been but for the illegal conduct.  Here, appellants
have already been placed in that position."

     The investors asked for certiorari on July 15, arguing that
the Second Circuit in effect resuscitated the "racketeering
injury" requirement rejected by the high court in Sedima v. Imrex
Co.  The petitioners asserted that under such reasoning, a RICO
claim for mail, wire or securities fraud "will not ripen until
all or part of its underlying investment is proved worthless and
its damages are finally determined to be uncollectible."

     In their response brief, the Milkens argued that the
appellate panel's ruling "is fully consistent with the precedents
of this Court and other circuits, and raises no question of
constitutional magnitude or national importance."

     The respondents asserted that Sedima was "simply irrelevant"
in the instant context.  "[T]he Sedima majority emphasized that a
RICO plaintiff 'can only recover to the extent that he has been
injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting
the violation [emphasis added]," they argued.  "[P]etitioners
suffered no injury in their business or property, whether caused
by the Milkens' alleged predicate acts or otherwise."

     The Milkens further deemed the investors' uncertainty of
accrual argument "a red herring.  The decision below did not even
reach the issue of when petitioners' purported RICO claim
accrued, much less the standard stated by petitioners."  The
respondents also rejected the petitioners' reliance on antitrust
precedent that holds a plaintiff damaged even when capital is
recovered.  Those cases, the Milkens argue, involve plaintiffs
that passed their overcharges along to their clients;
"Petitioners here did not recover their alleged losses by
'passing them on' to someone else."

     The Milkens further argued that the investors' bid for
attorneys' fees was never before the courts below, and improperly
raised on appeal.  The respondents asserted that the petitioners
were otherwise unentitled to fees, as they did not suffer a RICO
injury.

     Mark A. Belnick, David L. Kornblau and Steven Pacht of Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, New York, submitted the
response on behalf of Michael Milken.  Michael O. Finkelstein of
Lord, Day & Lord, Barrett Smith, New York, submitted the response
on behalf of Lowell Milken.

     George D. Reycraft and Debra Brown Steinberg of Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft, New York, represent the petitioners.

SD NY: FRAUD SUIT AGAINST NY BLUES BARRED BY FILED RATE DOCTRINE

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Aug. 17 dismissed the RICO counts raised by two
health insurance purchasers against Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield
of New York for allegedly submitting fraudulent applications for
rate increases to the state insurance department ("NYSID") over
1990-1993, determining the alleged claims to be barred by the
filed rate doctrine (Fersco et al. v. Empire Blue Cross/Blue
Shield of New York et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 4226 (JFK)).

     In the years at issue, Judge Keenan noted, the defendants
obtained rate increases of no less than 13.7% and as much as
25.5%.  The plaintiffs asserted that Empire obtained these
increases through "an intentional scheme of deception and
misrepresentation."  Empire, they alleged, exaggerated its
community-rated losses, understated its experience-rated losses
and exaggerated the impact of competition from large commercial
carriers in its filings with state regulators.

     In granting the defense's bid for summary judgment, Judge
Keenan looked to the Second Circuit's May ruling in Wegoland Ltd.
v. NYNEX Corp. (see Civil RICO LR, May 1994, P. 9,578) in finding
the claims barred.  "There is no dispute that Empire is a
regulated utility whose rates must be approved by a governing
regulatory agency, the NYSID," he noted.

     The plaintiffs' fraud allegations were "of little import,"
the judge found, as Wegoland v. NYNEX expressly rejected a fraud
exception to the filed rate doctrine.  The plaintiffs asserted
that they did not ask the court to engage in the rate-making
process, but only to ascertain whether the increases should have
been granted at all.  The court rejoined that it could not
determine "either the pervasiveness of the fraud or the
reasonableness of the rates existing prior to the increase
without a thorough understanding of the factors involved in
ascertaining a reasonable rate."

     The judge rejected the plaintiffs' citation to County of
Suffolk v. LILCO (2nd Cir. 1990), noting that the Wegoland panel
expressly rejected the earlier ruling as a bar to the filed rate
doctrine in RICO suits against utilities.  He concluded that the
plaintiffs "must pursue their claims through 'the proper
government officials,' who may challenge these rates 'in
appropriate circumstances.'"

NY JUDGE APPROVES $100M SETTLEMENT IN SALOMON BROTHERS ACTION

     Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York on Aug. 5 approved a
$100 million settlement of claims in the Salomon Brothers
Treasury Litigation (In re Salomon Brothers Treasury Litigation,
SD NY, No. 91 Civ. 5471 [RPP]; see Civil RICO LR, March 1994,
P. 9,410).

     The defendants in the case include Salomon Brothers Inc.,
Steinhardt Management Co. Inc. and Caxton Corp.

     The suit was filed by investors who were allegedly injured
by defendants' (1) rigging the bids in auctions of Treasury two-
year notes conducted in April, May and June of 1991 and
(2) engaging in a squeeze on the market for those securities from
April 1991 to September 1991 in violation of Sections 10(b) and
20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sherman Act, the
Commodity Exchange Act and RICO.

     Under the terms of the agreement, Salomon will contribute
$66 million to the settlement fund; Steinhardt Management and
Caxton will pay the remaining $34 million.  The judge also
awarded the plaintiffs $25 million in attorneys' fees.

     Representing the plaintiffs are Stanley M. Grossman of
Pomerantz Haudek Block & Grossman and Jules Brody of Stull, Stull
& Brody.  Counsel for Salomon is Cravath, Swaine & Moore;
representing Steinhardt Management is Schulte Roth & Zabel; and
counsel for Caxton is Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.  All of the

11TH CIR.: INTRODUCING BROKER, AGENT CANNOT COMPEL ARBITRATION

     An introducing broker/dealer and its agent were not third-
party beneficiaries of an arbitration agreement between the
plaintiff and a clearing broker and, therefore, cannot compel
arbitration of the plaintiff's securities, racketeering, common
law fraud, breach of fiduciary obligation and, under the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act, negligence and conspiracy
claims against them, said the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
on Aug. 19 (Taylor v. Investors Associates, Inc., et al., 11th
Cir., No. 93-5049).

               The panel said that the defendants did not qualify as
third party beneficiaries because an intent to benefit them was not
apparent from the construction of the arbitration agreement "in light
of all surrounding circumstances."

     According to court documents, co-defendant Mitchell
Goldberg, as agent for co-defendant Investors Associates, Inc.
(IAI), solicited plaintiff Don Taylor to buy and sell stock from
IAI.  On Jan. 6, 1992, Taylor purchased stock through IAI and,
the next day, signed a client's agreement with Prudential-Bache
Securities, which was to serve as clearing broker in the trading
arrangement.

     Taylor subsequently filed suit against IAI and Goldberg,
alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; Rule 10(b)(5); Section 12(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933; RICO; Texas Blue Sky Law; Texas Business and Commerce
Code; and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act.  The
defendants moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration or
dismiss the action.

     The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
concluded that the defendants could not compel arbitration, and
the appeals court panel affirmed in a per curiam opinion, which
adopted the trial court's decision.

     In his opinion below, U.S. District Judge William Justice
first noted that the arbitration clause did not mention IAI or
Goldberg by name or function, nor did those parties sign the
document.  Judge Justice rejected the defendants' contention that
they were included as parties to the pact through the use of
"you" (referring to Prudential) in the client's agreement,
because IAI allegedly supplied Taylor with the agreement.

     Second, Judge Justice said that the intent of the parties to
the arbitration agreement was manifest -- to arbitrate claims by
or against the clearing house concerning its handling of Taylor's
account.  In addition, a letter from Prudential, explaining that
it was not Taylor's broker, but his broker's clearing firm, makes
it clear that the defendants were independent from Prudential,
said the judge.

     Third, the defendants cannot rely on agency principles to
support their argument that they are entitled to enforce the
arbitration agreement, said the court.  Unlike the fact
situations in the cases cited by the defendants, here, the
disputed transaction did not involve the liquidation of stock
whereby the clearing house's services were employed, which might
make the clearing house a party to the suit, Judge Justice noted.
No claims in the suit pertain to Prudential's or Taylor's
accounts there, he said, and, hence, there was no contingent
right for the introducing broker to invoke the arbitration
agreement.

               Finally, with respect to the defendants' third-party
beneficiary argument, the defendants are not mentioned in the
arbitration agreement and no consent to arbitration with Goldberg
or IAI may be implied based solely on the relationship between
the introducing broker and the clearing house, said the court.

DE HIGH CT. SAYS APPRAISAL
RIGHTLY BARRED IN WRITTEN
CONSENT TIME WARNER MERGER

     If the "market out" exception would otherwise apply, the
fact that a merger is accomplished through the use of written
consents instead of a shareholder meeting is irrelevant, so an
objecting shareholder had no appraisal rights when he dissented
from the much litigated merger of Warner Communications, Inc.
into Time Warner Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court decided Dec. 18
in an issue of first impression.  Klotz v. Warner Communications,
Inc. et al., No. 222-95, (DE Sup. Ct.); see Corporate Officers &
Directors LR, June 7, 1995.

     The high court panel disagreed with the dissenting
shareholder's argument that equated merger by written approval
with short-form mergers under Section 253 of the Delaware General
Corporate Law.

     After the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of
Paramount Communications, Inc.'s challenge to the Time-Warner
deal, the merger was accomplished in a two-step process:  first,
Time purchased 100 million shares of Warner common stock to give
Time Warner, Inc. " as Time was then renamed " a 59.3% control of
Warner's outstanding shares.  Warner and Time Warner then
approved a merger agreement by written consent without a meeting
of the stockholders, who were informed that they were not
entitled to appraisal rights under the "market out" exception to
Section 262(b)(1) of the DGCL.

     Plaintiff Howard Klotz filed suit claiming that that
instruction is misleading since mergers approved by written
consent cannot fall within the market out exception.  According
to Klotz's reading of the statute, stockholders are entitled to
vote at the shareholders' meeting to act upon the agreement, or
else they get appraisal rights.  He said the procedure for
perfecting appraisal rights assumes that mergers approved by
written consent always trigger appraisal rights.

     The court agreed with defendant Warner's contention that the
entire lawsuit relies on a strained reading of Section 262 that
cannot be reconciled with the plain meaning for the statutory
language.  "Section 262(b)(1) denies appraisal rights for shares
of 'stock, which, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the
meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were traded in a public market,'" the court wrote.
"An action taken by written consent has a record date, which can
substitute for the stockholders meeting for purposes of Section
262(b)(1)."

     Section 262(b) unambiguously describes two circumstances
under which the market out exception does not apply, the court
said.  "First, Section 262 restores appraisal rights denied by
Section 262(b)(1) when stockholders receive consideration that
does not meet the requirements enumerated in Section Section
262(b)(2)(a)-(d).  Second, Section 262(b)(3) assures appraisal
rights to shares not owned by the parent corporation in all
mergers pursuant to 8 Del.C. Section 253."

     On appeal to the state Supreme Court, a panel led by Justice
Joseph Walsh agreed with the lower court's reasoning.  Justice
Walsh noted that the structure of the applicable subsection of
Section 262 places the market out exceptions in separate
paragraphs.  "Had the drafters intended to provide an additional
exception, they likely would have also included it in a separate
paragraph," but "...the exception proposed by Klotz is in the
same sentence which defines the market out."

     The panel was not persuaded by Klotz's argument equating
short-form mergers under Section 253 of the DGCL with mergers by
written approval.  "The General Assembly provided in an
additional paragraph that shareholders of a company that was
merged pursuant to Section 253 are entitled to appraisal," but
"despite other similarities between the short-form merger
procedure and merger approval by written consent, the lack of
such a paragraph granting appraisal in the latter circumstance is
a crucial difference," Justice Walsh wrote.

     Finally, no policy objectives would be served by adopting
Klotz's interpretation, the panel held.

     The plaintiff is represented by Pamela Tikellis of
Chimicles, Jacobsen & Tikellis in Wilmington, and by Daniel
Krasner and Edward Dietrich of Wolf, Haldenstein, Adler, Freeman
& Herz in New York City.

     Defendants are represented by Charles Richards Jr. and
Matthew Ferretti of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington and
by Max Gitter of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New
York City.

OFFICERS OF FAILED
CA THRIFT AGREE TO PAY
$8.5 MILLION RESTITUTION

               The former owner, president and chairman of the board of a
failed California thrift and his wife, a former executive and
board member of the institution, have paid $8.5 million in
restitution and have been prohibited from working for any
federally insured banking institution, the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) announced on Dec. 18.  In the Matter of Russell
M. Jedinak and In the Matter of Rebecca Manley Jedinak, Nos. SF-
95-023 and SF-95-024 (OTS).

     Russell and Rebecca Jedinak, the former officials of failed
Guardian Savings and Loan in Huntington Beach, CA, agreed to the
restitution in consent orders with OTS and a concurrently
executed settlement agreement with the Resolution Trust Corp.
(RTC).  The couple paid the $8.5 million restitution to the RTC
as receiver for Guardian.

     OTS accused the two of multiple offenses including breach of
duty, conflict of interest, unsafe and unsound conduct that
caused substantial loss to the thrift, and violation of banking
laws and regulations.  In consenting to the orders, the Jedinaks
neither admitted nor denied the OTS charges.

     Guardian, with assets of $682 million, was placed in
conservatorship in June 1991 and subsequently into receivership
six months later.  The Jedinaks were removed from their positions
with the institution under the terms of a 1991 cease and desist
consent order.

     The OTS accused the Jedinaks of violating their fiduciary
duty by having the thrift provide them with credit at no interest
or at artificially low interest rates.  The OTS said the breach
of duty allegations extended to a number of personal trips the
Jedinaks billed the thrift for as well as the cost of maintaining
their personal property.

     In addition, the OTS said the Jedinaks did not adequately
underwrite the origination and modification of several large real
estate loans, causing a substantial loss to Guardian.  The
Jedinaks also personally benefited from several loans, the OTS
said.

     The OTS further claimed that the Jedinaks did not have
Guardian provide a reserve for certain loan losses and failed to
perform due diligence on certain asset acquisitions and
commercial loans.  The OTS also claimed that the Jedinaks had
Guardian pay an unauthorized dividend that was unsafe and unsound
and then had the thrift misreport its financial condition in its
books and records.

ONLY TRUSTEE CAN ASSERT
ALTER EGO CLAIMS AGAINST
PRINCIPALS, SAYS NC COURT

               A creditor cannot pursue alter ego claims against a debtor's
alleged controllers unless the bankruptcy trustee has abandoned
the claims, a federal judge in North Carolina held Nov. 30,
dismissing derivative charges of unfair and deceptive trade
practices against third parties who allegedly controlled a
bankrupt corporation to avoid personal liability.
Trans-Continental Meats Inc. v. Shaw Food Services Inc. et al.,
No. 5:94-CV-875-BO (ED NC).

     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theory
vests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where state
law provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,
the judge said.

     North/South Meatpackers Inc. bought products from
Trans-Continental Meats but failed to pay for them.  An
involuntary Chapter 7 petition was filed against North/South in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina.  Trans-Continental then filed a U.S. District Court
complaint against four individuals and three companies that
allegedly controlled North/South.  The defendants moved to
dismiss for lack of standing.

     Judge Terrence W. Boyle granted the defense motion and said
Trans-Continental cannot reassert its claims unless they are
abandoned by North/South's trustee.

     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theory
vests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where state
law provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,
Judge Boyle said.  In this case, the trustee has decided to
pursue the claims through an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy
court, he noted.

     In addition, he said, an identity-type alter ego action
arises from general injury to the creditors of a corporation that
lacks a separate and distinct corporate identity and operates as
a mere shell.  Nor was there an allegation that the defendants
used North/South as an instrument to defraud Trans-Continental in
particular, he said, even if North/South was undercapitalized and
controlled by the defendants to avoid liability.

     As a result, he said, Trans-Continental's claims are deemed
assets of the debtor's estate and subject to an automatic stay.

TN CT. WILL NOT REHEAR
DECISION ON AMENDMENT TO
SUIT AGAINST EX-DIRECTORS

     In a Dec. 1 ruling, the Tennessee Court of Appeals rejected
the plea of the ex-directors of a defunct insurance group to
reconsider its decision that the Tennessee Insurance
Commissioner's breach of duty charges against them should not
have been dismissed without leave to amend the complaint.  United
Physicians Insurance Risk Retention Group v. Belisomo et al.,
No. 01-A-01-9595-CH-00189 (TN Ct. App.).

     The ex-directors unsuccessfully argued that the appellate
panel permitted the addition of a bad faith allegation to a cause
of action whose summary dismissal it has affirmed and added
issues and defendants after substantial discovery had been
completed.

     The action was brought by the office of the Tennessee
Commissioner of Commerce and Insurance as liquidator/receiver for
United Physicians Insurance Risk Retention Group to recover
damages allegedly suffered by the company as a result of
misconduct by the defendant directors.  The original complaint
filed in June 1993 charged that each of the defendant-appellees "
John Fuhrman, Allan Gibofsky, Richard Goodman, Claude Moorman,
Stewart Reuter, Daniel Shirey, Donald O'Sullivan, Richard Tyler,
Michael Victor and Cyril Wecht " breached a fiduciary duty by
abdicating their authority to the executive committee.

     The trial court granted the appellee directors summary
judgment after finding that plaintiff's second amended complaint
did not allege a breach of duty against them.

     The appellate panel said the allegation that appellees
delegated powers to an executive committee that may have
committed acts of disloyalty does not assert disloyalty on the
part of appellees; therefore, the complaint was properly
dismissed.

     However, as to the denial of the motion to file an amended
complaint with specific charges of how the directors profited
from their actions allegedly to the detriment of the company, the
appellate court said it "takes judicial knowledge that an outside
receiver of a corporation is at a distinct disadvantage in
efforts to discover the causes of insolvency including the search
of voluminous records and extensive discovery."  The order
denying leave to file an amended complaint was vacated.

     The ex-directors sought rehearing of the panel's decision to
allow the filing of an amended complaint on grounds that the
panel's opinion (1) incorrectly states the material facts
established by the evidence; (2) is in conflict with prior
decisions and other principles of law; (3) overlooks or
misapprehends a material fact or proposition of law; and
(4) relies upon matters of fact and law upon which the parties
have not been heard and that are open to reasonable dispute.

     The proposed amended complaint that the panel allowed to be
filed contains additional allegations that were not the subject
of the court's opinion, including a charge of bad faith stemming
from the breach of duty charge, which the panel previously ruled
was properly disposed of on summary judgment, the ex-board
members contend.  The opinion could permit plaintiff to present
new allegations against new defendants and would necessitate the
reopening of discovery, appellees aver.

     The appellees also took issue with the panel's
characterization of the Insurance Commissioner as being at a
disadvantage in discovering the causes of the defunct
corporation's insolvency.

     "Indeed, the various pleadings in the record reflect that
appellant has had not only the resources of the Tennessee
Department of Commerce and Insurance, but also the legal services
of two outside law firms from the outset," the ex-directors
maintained.  "Here, whether or not 'an outside receiver of a
corporation is at a distinct disadvantage in efforts to discover
the causes of insolvency'...are not, as required for judicial
notice, facts so universally known, of such universal notoriety,
and so generally understood that they are within the common
knowledge of every person."

     The panel's ruling on rehearing made minor changes in the
Oct. 13 opinion but declined to reconsider the decision.

     Plaintiffs are represented by William Hubbard and Brenner
Van Meter of Weed, Hubbard, Berry & Douchty in Nashville.

     Defendant appellees are represented by Aubrey Harwell Jr.,
D. Anne Davis and John Beiter of Neal & Harwell in Nashville.

CT.: CO. INFO COMPILED BY
ATTY. WHO WASN'T COUNSEL
NOT PROTECTED BY PRIVILEGE

     Corporate documents that were prepared by an attorney who
was not acting as the company's counsel in anticipation of
litigation are not protected by the attorney-client or work
product privileges, said Vice Chancellor Myron Steele in a
Dec. 15 ruling in Delaware Chancery Court.  Lee v. Engle,
No. 13323 (DE Ch. Ct.); Frank v. Engle, No. 13284 (DE Ch. Ct.)

     The memorandum opinion granted the discovery requests of the
shareholder derivative plaintiffs and rejected the defendant
directors' attempted use of the Illinois accountant-client
privilege, but it found no reason to compel the production of
draft versions of documents that were later filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

     Richard Frank and Robert Lee brought separate actions
against certain officers and directors of several corporations
related to what is now Sunstates Corp., alleging waste of
corporate assets and breach of duty.  (Frank's action also
charged failure to pay dividends and violations of disclosure
duty with regard to a proxy statement.)  The court consolidated
the suits for discovery dispute purposes.

     In deciding plaintiffs' motion to compel production of
documents withheld on the basis of privilege, the vice chancellor
said the chancery court has followed the reasoning of Garner v.
Wolfinbarger, 430 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401
U.S. 974 (1971), which implies a three-part test to decide
whether the attorney-client privilege should be invoked:  (1) the
nature and colorableness of the claim, (2) the necessity of and
alternate access to the information, and (3) the extent to which
the information is identified.

     In this case, although much of the disputed information was
generated by Sunstates' secretary and vice president " who is an
attorney " he was not the in-house counsel and was not acting as
legal counsel to Sunstates.  "Therefore, he cannot avail himself
of the protection associated with the attorney-client or the work
product privilege," the court held.  However, the court added
that even assuming that the officer acted as the company counsel,
"[p]laintiffs have shown good cause necessitating production of
certain withheld documents.  First, plaintiffs are minority
shareholders of Sunstates seeking information related to
transactions they challenge as breaches of fiduciary
responsibility."

     Second, the court said, "[t]he withheld documents may lead
to the discovery of information relevant to the transactions
plaintiffs contest as breaches of fiduciary duty.  Furthermore,
these documents may be the best evidence of the facts they
contain which otherwise would be unavailable from any other
practical source," the court wrote.  "Third, the record does not
leave me with the impression plaintiffs' request for document
production constitutes a blind 'fishing expedition.'"

     As to defendants' attempt to use the Illinois accountant-
client privilege to protect some of the documents, the court
noted that "Delaware does not recognize the accountant-client
privilege; nor do the Federal Courts....  Nevertheless,
defendants argue this court should apply Illinois law...because
Illinois is the state with the most significant relationship to
the communications in issue.  I disagree."

     Sunstates knowingly incorporated in Delaware, which
"...constitutes a knowing and voluntary request for the widely
recognized benefits and advantages flowing from the application
of Delaware general corporate law...," the court pointed out.
"Besides, Illinois' only connection with Sunstates is that
Illinois accountants originally generated or received the
documents defendants want to protect," it added.

     However, the court found no reason to compel draft versions
of disclosure documents that the company intended for public
disclosure.

               The Frank plaintiffs are represented by Kevin Gross of
Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess and Robert Goldberg of Biggs
& Battaglia, both in Wilmington.  The Lee plaintiffs are
represented by Stephen Lowey and Sherrie Brown of Lowey,
Dannenberg, Bemporad & Selinger, and by Lawrence Sucharow, Linda
Nussbaum and Barbara Hart of Goodkind, Labaton, Rudoff &
Sucharow, all in New York City.

     Sunstates is represented by Clark Furlow and Joanne Shalk of
Smith, Katzenstein & Furlow in Wilmington and by Zwerling,
Schachter & Zwerling in New York City.  The other corporate
defendants are represented by Michael Goldman, Stephen Norman and

DEMAND EXCUSED BY MAJORITY
HOLDER'S INFLUENCE ON
BOARD MEMBER, SAYS DE CT.

     A shareholder plaintiff was excused from making pre-suit
demand on the board of York Research Corp. by a Delaware state
court judge who on Dec. 4 found that a majority of the board
lacked independence due to a dominant director/shareholder's
ability to exert "considerable influence" over a swing vote
director.  Friedman v. Beningson et al., No. 12232 (DE Ch. Ct.).

     In his memorandum opinion, Chancellor William T. Allen
rejected a motion to dismiss breach of duty and insider trading
charges from Delaware Chancery Court, finding that in order to
allege lack of independence, it was not necessary to show that
the swing vote director's continued employment and remuneration
hinged solely on the whim of the controlling director.

     At issue in the derivative suit by Irving Friedman was the
decision of York Research Corp. " a Delaware company that
develops, constructs and operates co-generation power plants " to
issue interest-free loans to several of its directors and
officers so that they could buy large blocks of stock in the
company.  According to the complaint, the directors and officers
then made false statements regarding revenue growth and future
business prospects to inflate York's stock price and sold their
shares before announcing that revenues would be significantly
below projections.

     Friedman alleged that the defendant officers and directors
not only misused corporate office but cost the company a $500,000
settlement used to obtain the dismissal of shareholder securities
suits in federal court in New York City.

     After the suit was amended, defendants in July 1993 moved to
dismiss it for failure to make demand on the board before
initiating the action.  Friedman contended that he was excused
from making pre-suit demand because the majority of the three
board members lacked both independence and disinterest.  He said
defendant York director/president Robert Beningson was the
mastermind of the interest-free loan and insider trading scheme
and that he exerted a controlling interest over board member John
Ellis through his control of his remuneration.

     The court said it need only address the first prong of the
two-prong test used in Aronson v. Lewis, DE Sup. 473 A.2d 805,
814 (1984), i.e., whether plaintiff has alleged particularized
facts creating a reasonable doubt whether those directors could,
under the circumstances, exercise a judgment on the suit and
demand that would qualify for the deference of the business
judgment rule.

     "This inquiry may include the subject whether some or all
directors are 'beholden' to or under the control, domination or
strong influence of a party with a material financial interest in
the transaction under attack, which interest is adverse to that
of the corporation," the court wrote.  "Such circumstances alone
may sometimes raise a reasonable doubt that directors in such a
situation could exercise judgment on behalf of the corporation
concerning the transaction involving such dominant or influential
party."

     The court noted that the state Supreme Court held in Rales
v. Blasband, DE Sup. 634 A.2d 927, 936 (1993), that "although the
director/officer's continued employment and remuneration did not
hinge solely on his relations with the defendant directors, the
official authority of the defendant directors 'placed them in a
position to exert considerable influence over the director
officer.'"  Ellis's continued receipt of consulting fees,
"...when considered in the context of the other facts alleged,
represents a substantial interest subject to possible corporate
retribution had he exercised judgment in a way displeasing to the
financially interested shareholder/CEO," the court concluded.

     The court also noted that Beningson's ties to York's
principal client empower him in relation to the other directors,
"...since they must remain cognizant of and sensitive to his
ability to affect York's business prospects."  The chancellor
also noted (1) the size of the loans " the loan to Beningson was
greater than the company's net revenue that year; and (2) York's
settlement of the federal class actions without any director
contribution, despite the profits earned by Beningson.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and John Day
of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington; and Ronald
Futterman and Michael Behn of Futterman & Howard, Chtd. in
Chicago.

     Defendants are represented by Richard Elliot Jr. and Thomas
Beck of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington; and Roger

6TH CIR. REINSTATES SUIT
DESPITE FAILURE TO PRODUCE
OFFICER FOR DISCOVERY

     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 reinstated
a breach of contract complaint although the plaintiff repeatedly
failed to produce an officer for depositions.  Roots Contracting
and Trading Co. v. Creighton Ltd. et al., No. 94-5752 (6th Cir.).

     The panel said if the suit is again dismissed, the trial
court must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other
reasons to support the inference that Roots engaged in a course
of conduct to evade deposition and it must explain why lesser
sanctions were rejected.

     Roots Contracting and Trading, a Qatari limited liability
company, contracted for a joint venture with Creighton Ltd., a
Cayman Islands corporation headquartered in Nashville, to build a
government-sponsored hospital in Qatar.  The Qatari government
terminated the construction contract due to Creighton's work
deficiencies and delays.

     Roots sued Creighton and other defendants in the Middle
District of Tennessee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,
dissolution of the joint venture, breach of contract and an
accounting.

     During the Persian Gulf War, two codefendants noticed the
Nashville deposition of Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, who chaired
Roots' board of directors and served as managing agent.  At the
time, Al-Attiyah was chief of the cabinet of the Qatari Interior
Ministry.

     Roots opposed the deposition, contending Al-Attiyah was
merely a passive minority shareholder who performed no managerial
duties, received no salary and knew nothing about the company's
business operations; Roots also said its general manager, who was
deposed, had the same knowledge as Al-Attiyah about the hospital
project.  However, the defendants offered evidence Al-Attiyah was
a policy maker and an operational factor in Roots.

     Al-Attiyah failed repeatedly to appear.  Roots argued that
the Qatari interior minister had refused to allow him to leave
the country; meanwhile, he rose to become minister of energy and
industry and president of OPEC.  Ultimately, Chief Judge John T.
Nixon granted a defense motion to dismiss the complaint as a
discovery sanction.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded in a per curiam
opinion.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize
dismissal as a sanction for the refusal of an officer, director
or managing agent to provide discovery, this particular dismissal
was an abuse of discretion, the panel held.  Judge Nixon failed
to articulate sufficient findings of fact to justify the
sanction, it said.

     If Judge Nixon again dismisses the complaint on remand, he
must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other
reasons for Roots' failure to produce Al-Attiyah to support the
inference that Roots engaged in a course of conduct to evade
deposition.  Those findings also should explain why lesser
sanctions were rejected, it said.  In addition, it said there
should be findings as to how the defendants would be prejudiced
if they cannot depose Al-Attiyah in Nashville.

HYPERION TRUST INVESTORS
URGE SECOND CIRCUIT
TO REINSTATE THEIR SUIT

     The plaintiffs in the Hyperion Securities Litigation argued
to the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 23 that the
district court erred in dismissing their suit over investment
losses involving the Hyperion Trusts.  In re Hyperion Securities
Litigation, No. 93 Civ. 7179 (SD NY); see Corporate Officers &
Directors Liability LR, Oct. 4, 1995.

     T111plaintiffs, Marilyn Olkey and others, labeled as
"without foundation" the district court's holding that, as a
matter of law, the interest rate bias and risks to capital posed
by the Trusts' investment strategy were adequately disclosed.
The plaintiffs said the court focused "upon fragmented and
isolated statements to reach that conclusion" and "completely
discounted as mere 'expectations' defendants' repeated
representations that they would design 'balanced' portfolios."
The court ignored the crucial fact that the defendants never made
such an effort, even though the prospectuses stated clearly that
each Trust "has designed the initial composition of the Trust
portfolio and will manage the portfolio on an ongoing basis in an
attempt to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on
the net asset value of the portfolio."

     This and similar representations of a balanced portfolio
were made through each prospectus, the plaintiffs said, but the
district court completely ignored the fact that investors
bargained for one thing but received something quite different.
The plaintiff said the court ignored its duty under McMahan & Co.
v. Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., 900 F.2d 576 (2nd Cir. 1990,
cert. denied, 1991)[see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Oct.
4, 1995, 18,274) to read the prospectus as a whole.  The court
also disregarded its obligation to construe the complaint in the
manner most favorable to the plaintiffs, they said.

     The plaintiffs contended:  "In fact, the court drew all
inferences, however strained, in defendants' favor.  The court
wound up with a conclusion that lacked any real world
sensibility:  investors knowingly invested in a low yield, high
risk investment."

     The plaintiffs further argued that the various authorities
relied on by the district court provide no support for its
decision.  "The 'bespeaks caution' doctrine mentioned by the
court is only a new label for describing what a reasonable
investor should have understood based upon the representations
made," the plaintiffs said.  Moreover, they said, the decisions
cited by the district court involve fact patterns far removed
from this one.  Here, the plaintiffs said, conservative risk-
adverse investors were told repeatedly that there would be an
attempt to balance the portfolio to attempt to neutralize the
impact on capital of movements in interest rates.  In fact, they
said, no such effort was made, and as a result, the defendants
"destroyed much of the capital that had been placed with them."

     The plaintiffs claim to have lost more than $325 million as
a result of putting their money in securities offered by three
closed-end investment companies known as the Hyperion Trusts.
The Trusts' assets consisted of zero coupon securities,
collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed
securities.  The defendants include the three Trusts; Hyperion
Capital Management (HCM), which served as investment advisor and
administrator for the Trusts; individuals who were officers and
directors of the Trusts and of Hyperion Capital; and nine
underwriters that participated in the Hyperion offerings.

     The district court ruled on July 12 that the plaintiffs have
no case because the offering materials disclosed both the Trusts'
investment strategy and the attendant risk.  The second amended
complaint was dismissed without leave to replead.

     The three defendant Trusts and four individual defendants "
Rodman L. Drake, Garth Marston, Harry E. Petersen Jr. and Leo M.
Walsh Jr. (collectively the Trust Defendants) " told the court in
a Nov. 30 appellee brief that the plaintiffs have "no facts at
all" that would warrant their "conclusory allegation" that the
Trust managers, instead of constructing and managing each
portfolio so as to minimize the impact of changes in interest
rates on the net asset value, intended to construct portfolios
that would do well when interest rates rose and do disastrously
when interest rates fell.  The lack of a factual basis to support
this contention, the Trust Defendants said, renders the
plaintiffs' pleading deficient under First Nationwide Bank v.
Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763 (2nd Cir. 1994, cert. denied,
1995).  In addition, the Trust Defendants said, the assertion is
"inherently implausible."

     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' assertion is based
on the opinion of experts who looked at the list of securities in
the initial Trust portfolios.  "What methodology these experts
used to arrive at this conclusion, and what assumptions may have
been, are matters that plaintiffs have steadfastly refused to
disclose," the Trust Defendants said.

     The Trust Defendants argued:  "The fact is that the task
plaintiffs claim their experts have performed " divining the
Trust managers' long-term investment objectives from a scan of
the first day's list of securities " is not capable of being
done.  The initial securities list could change the next day or
minute.  Indeed, the prospectuses themselves made painstakingly
clear that the managers would restructure the portfolios as often
as necessary to react to changing economic conditions."

     As for the plaintiffs' reliance on a Hyperion 1999 semi-
annual report statement that the initial portfolio was designed
"with a bias toward a rising interest rate environment," "the
fact is," the Trust Defendants said, "that the Hyperion 1999
prospectus (as well as the [Hyperion] 1997 and 2002 prospectuses)
stated the same proposition."

     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' contention that
the Trust prospectuses failed adequately to warn investors of
possible capital losses "is simply divorced from the reality of
these prospectuses, which issued such warnings again and again."

     Hyperion Capital Management and five individual defendants "
Lewis S. Ranieri, Kenneth C. Weiss, David R. Odenath Jr.,
Patricia Sloan and Alan M. Mandel (collectively the HCM
Defendants) " argued to the court in an appellee brief also filed
Nov. 30 that since the outset of this putative class action, the
plaintiffs have drafted innumerable complaints, all in search of
a viable securities law claim.  The plaintiffs' quest, the HCM
Defendants said, has been stymied by one major obstacle: the
plaintiffs cannot identify a material misrepresentation by the
defendants because the prospectus for each trust disclosed every
risk that the plaintiffs have asserted as the basis for their
claims.

     "Moreover," the HCM Defendants said, "the prospectuses
described those risks with clarity in the very circumstances that
came to pass: a substantial decrease in interest rates that
triggered a large volume of mortgage prepayments."

     The Underwriter Defendants argued in a brief, also filed
Nov. 30, that the district court properly held that the
prospectuses fully disclosed all the relevant risks of investing
in the Hyperion funds.

     The Underwriters stated:  "Plaintiffs also complain of the
selection and management of the Hyperion Funds' investment
portfolios subsequent to their initial public offerings.  As a
matter of law the Underwriter Defendants bear no responsibility
for the manner in which the Funds' post-offering portfolios were
designed and managed after the initial public offerings; whatever
continuing responsibilities there were belonged to the Funds,
their managements and advisors after they obtained the proceeds
from the initial public offerings."

     The Underwriter Defendants are Smith Barney Inc.; Prudential
Securities Inc.; Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc; Merrill Lynch & Co.;
Oppenheimer & Co Inc.; Dain Bosworth Inc.; Advest Inc.; Paine
Webber Inc.; and Crowell, Weedon & Co.

SUITOR CLAIMS TARGET BOARD
MADE FALSE STATEMENTS IN
PROXY AND 'ROADSHOW'

     Hostile suitor and proxy opponent Kidsco Inc. claims in a
suit filed Dec. 1 in federal court in Wilmington that the board
of target The Learning Co. has violated federal securities laws
by making false and misleading statements about Kidsco and its
proposal in a proxy solicitation and in "roadshow" presentations
to investors.  Kidsco Inc. et al. v. The Learning Co. et al.,
No. 95-733, (D DE).

     In July, The Learning Co. (TLC), a Delaware corporation that
produces and distributes educational personal computer software
products, agreed to merge with Broderbund Software, Inc., a
Delaware corporation that develops and distributes personal
computer software for home, school and small businesses.  Three
months later, SoftKey International, Inc. (SII), a producer of
children's educational software, launched a tender offer for TLC
through its subsidiary Kidsco Inc., and a proxy campaign to
replace the TLC board with nominees who would dismantle the
company's takeover defenses.

     The TLC board, which had signed no-shop and good-bye fee
agreements with Broderbund, declined to examine the SII offer but
secured a more favorable stock-swap exchange ratio from
Broderbund.  It told the shareholders that the synergy inherent
in a merger with Broderbund offered greater long-term value.
When SII began soliciting the backing of the minimum 10% of TLC
shareholders in order to demand a special meeting at which it
would attempt to depose the board, the TLC board amended the
company bylaws to the effect that SII's special meeting could not
be held until after the meeting at which the shareholders were to
vote on the Broderbund offer.

     Suits filed in Delaware Chancery Court by both SII and by
shareholders Ernest Hack and Irving Kas, which were consolidated,
charged that the directors breached their duty by failing to
consider the superior SII bid and asked the court to invalidate
the bylaw change.

     In the federal suit, Kidsco and SII charged that TLC
officers and directors violated federal securities laws by "false
and misleading statements denigrating SoftKey's business,
management and prospects in violation of Sections 14(a) and 14(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."

     In numerous "roadshow" presentations to investors, TLC
officials have supplied false and incomplete information on the
financial status of SII and on the prospects for a combined
SII/TLC entity, the suit claims.

     A proxy for an upcoming shareholder meeting leaves
shareholders unclear as to whether the board thinks it can vote
proxy cards sent in for a previous meeting that was canceled, the
suit asserts.

     SII is represented by Edward Welch and Andrew Turezyn of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Wilmington; by Jay
Kasner, George Zimmerman and Steven Kollney of that firm's New
York City office; and by Stephen Lamb of Law Offices of Stephen

SEC'S PA SUIT CLAIMS CABLE
DIRECTOR BOUGHT STOCK ON
INSIDE INFO ABOUT MERGER

     A federal lawsuit filed Dec. 6 in Philadelphia by the
Securities and Exchange Commission charges cable television
magnate Harold Lenfest with insider trading in connection with
the attempted merger of his company's parent corporation and Bell
Atlantic Corp.  Securities & Exchange Commission v. Lenfest and
Lenfest, No. 95-7597 (ED PA).

     The suit alleges that, as a director of Liberty Media Corp.,
Lenfest was warned against trading on or disclosing the
information that Liberty " which had recently been reacquired by
ex-parent Tele-Communications Inc. " would be part of a merger
with Bell Atlantic in 1993.  Nevertheless, he revealed the
information to his wife, Marguerite, who was also an officer of
Liberty, and she instructed her son Chase to buy stock in either
TCI or Liberty.

     Two days after Chase bought large blocks of TCI stock for
his mother and himself, Bell Atlantic announced the merger plan,
and TCI stock skyrocketed, the SEC claims.  On paper, the
Lenfests earned a profit of $120,750 on 35,000 shares.

     The SEC charges that both Harold and his wife violated both
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and their
fiduciary duty as officers of Liberty.  The suit also asks the
court to order the two to disgorge their profits and to pay civil
penalties.

     The SEC is represented by Thomas Newkirk, Associate Director
in Washington, DC, and Senior Trial Counsel Richard Levan in
Philadelphia.

     The Lenfests are represented by Richard Morvillo of Crowell
& Moring in Washington, DC.

DEFENDANTS IN MI CASE
SEEK PROTECTIVE ORDER,
NOTE DISAGREEMENTS

     The defendants in the Mutual Savings Bank Securities
Litigation moved the federal court in Detroit on Nov. 13 for a
protective order covering what they describe as "a small portion"
of the more than 25,000 pages of documents the defendants have
produced in response to the plaintiffs' requests.  In re Mutual
Savings Bank Securities Litigation, No. 95-CV-71590-DT (Judge
John Feikens) (ED MI, Southern Div.).

     The defendants " Mutual Savings Bank and co-defendants "
said the parties have worked on drafting a proposed protective
order but have run into two areas of disagreement.

     The first area, the defendants said, involves their request
that in addition to informing a nonparty (including an expert
witness) of the existence and nature of the protective order, any
such person to whom confidential documents are shown should be
required to sign a written undertaking to abide by the order.
The defendants said this will eliminate any later dispute
regarding whether a person was or was not informed of the
provisions of the order, and the act of signing an
acknowledgement should serve to reinforce the obligations imposed
by the order.

     The defendants said there is no reason for the plaintiffs'
opposition to the signed acknowledgement because the order
proposed by the defendants would not require the plaintiffs to
submit all the signed acknowledgements to defendants, i.e., the
plaintiffs would not be required to disclose the identity of
persons, such as potential expert witnesses, to whom they
provided any confidential material unless an issue arose
regarding misuse of the information.  The defendants said:  "The
requirement of the signed acknowledgement is a reasonable
prophylactic measure which imposes no material burden.  It should
be embodied in the protective order."

     The defendants said the second area of disagreement relates
to the protection that will be given information included in
confidential documents when that information is recounted in or
attached to a document filed with the court.  The defendants said
they recognize that there is a distinction between the
protections afforded to the fruits of discovery and to materials
filed with the court.  "Yet if plaintiffs can unilaterally file
confidential material in the public court file," the defendants
said, "any protection to which the information may be entitled
would be mooted."  The defendants said they request that the
plaintiffs provide reasonable advance notice of an intention to
file such material, thereby giving the defendants the chance to
seek relief from the court.  "If the requirement of advance
notice is burdensome," the defendants said, "an alternative would
be to permit the material to be filed under seal subject to the
producing party filing, within a specified short date, a motion
to retain the material under seal."

     In a Dec. 4 brief opposing the motion, the plaintiffs said
the requirements proposed by the defendants would impose
"unnecessary and undue burdens" on the plaintiffs in a situation
where the defendants have not even attempted to meet their
initial burden of establishing that such documents should be
treated as confidential.

     The defendants, the plaintiffs said, seek a provision that
would require all class members and non-parties (including
consultants and expert witnesses) to execute signed
acknowledgments that they have received the proposed protective
order, prior to reviewing any documents that the defendants may
have unilaterally designated as "confidential."

     "Contrary to Defendants' assertion that this requirement is
a reasonably prophylactic measure which imposes no material
burden on Plaintiffs," the court was told, "this provision
effectively 'chills' Plaintiffs' ability to pursue and obtain
relevant discovery by (i) potentially subjecting every person
shown a 'confidential' document to the jurisdiction of this court
through, vis-a-vis, their signed acknowledgement, and
(ii) imposing an additional burden on Plaintiffs to obtain,
maintain and produce, if required, all such acknowledgements."

     Similarly, the plaintiffs contended, they object to the
proposed provision that would require a party intending to file a
document unilaterally designed by defendants as "confidential" to
give four business days notice to the opposing party of intent to
file, and file such document under seal.  The plaintiffs said
case authority shows that a protective order that so restricts
public disclosure, prior to a court finding that the information
sought warrants protection, is a prior restraint on the First
Amendment right of expression.

     (Copies of the plaintiffs' opposition brief and the
defendants' motion for a protective order are available from
Andrew Document Access Service.)

     On Oct. 20, the parties stipulated that Count IV of the
complaint, alleging negligent misrepresentation, should be
dismissed without prejudice.

     The litigation was initiated by three shareholders in Mutual
Savings Bank, who allege that the bank and its co-defendants
concealed the risky nature of Mutual's investments, particularly
the interest rate-sensitive nature of investments in mortgage-
backed derivatives.  The plaintiffs claim the defendants also
misrepresented the success of the bank's new loan origination and
loan service business and that the defendants artificially
inflated the market price of the stock during the purported class
period " Nov. 30, 1993, through Nov. 14, 1994.  In addition, the
plaintiffs allege that certain of the defendant directors reaped
substantial profits from their sale of bank stock, based on their
private confidential negative information, not available to
members of the investing public.

     The defendants are represented by Allan Horwich, Eugene J.
Geekie Jr. and Adam C. Smedstad of Schiff Hardin & Waite in
Chicago.  Of counsel is the firm of Howard & Howard in Bloomfield
Hills, MI.  The plaintiffs are represented by Elwood S. Simon and

PA CLAIM AGAINST QUAD HAS
MORE SUBSTANCE THAN U.S.
HEALTHCARE SUIT, CT. TOLD

     Citing a ruling by the same court in J/H Real Estate Inc. v.
Abramson, plaintiffs in a class action alleging securities
manipulation and fraud by Quad Systems Corp. and three of its
officers on Dec. 27 told the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia
that their claims are more specific than those the court refused
to dismiss in the suit against officers of U.S. Healthcare.
Pozzi v. Smith, No. 95-1454 (ED PA); see Corporate Officers &
Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995.

     Plaintiff Diane D. Pozzi purchased 1,000 shares of Quad in
February 1992 at $13.25 a share.  By March 8, the stock price had
fallen to $7.25, triggering the instant suit.  Quad,
headquartered in Warminster, PA, manufactures surface-mount
assembly equipment used to make printed circuit boards.  In
addition to the company, the complaint names Quad president and
CEO David Smith; David Young, a founder and member of the board;
and Anthony Drury, senior vice president and CFO.

     The complaint asserts that Quad officers misrepresented
company revenues and shielded the public from the fact that a new
product had developed problems and had not brought in expected
revenues.  Although company officials wrote a letter Jan. 30,
1995, notifying shareholders that the company was experiencing
"some software issues with regard to ease of use" of a main
product, it was not distributed until a later date, Pozzi
charged.

     In support of their original motion to dismiss, defendants
argued that the "bespeaks caution" doctrine adopted by the Third
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals compels dismissal because the
uncertainties of software development were adequately disclosed
by the company.  However, in his Dec. 1 opinion, the judge noted
that "even though Quad made certain cautionary statements about
software limitations and bugs (which it soft-pedalled by
describing them as not unusual), it was simultaneously hiding the
effect of those problems on the company's business."

     Defendants moved to reargue the decision, but plaintiffs
countered that the complaint in J/H Real Estate Inc. v. Abramson
et al. (see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995,
P. 18,687), in which a class has been certified and allegations
of negligent misrepresentation have survived motions to dismiss,
lacks the specificity contained in the charges against Quad, its
president, one of the company's founders and its chief financial
officer.

     Pozzi's allegations contain more detail than the complaint
sustained in Abramson, plaintiffs assert. The need for
individualized proof of reliance should not direct trial courts
toward denying class certification, plaintiffs argued, adding
several citations.  Defendants' efforts to induce the court to go
outside the pleading to analyze plaintiff's reliance is
inappropriate in the context of a motion to dismiss and factually
inaccurate, plaintiffs stated.

     On Jan. 31, 1995, plaintiffs stated, defendants conducted an
analysts' conference and misinformed them regarding any
significant functional problems with the company's software.  At
least one stockbroker reiterated its recommendation to buy Quad
stock based on that conference call, plaintiffs argued.  Pozzi's
testimony demonstrates that she relied on defendants' statements
made to the broker, plaintiffs argued.

     Defendants are represented by R. Nicholas Gimbel of the
Philadelphia firm of Klett Lieber Rooney & Schorling.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Dennis J. Johnson of
Havertown, PA, and by Barbara Podell of the Philadelphia firm of
Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan.

RI BREACH OF DUTY CLAIM
AGAINST GENERAL PARTNERS
FAILS; DISCLOSURE ADEQUATE

     Finding that defendant general partners made all the
necessary disclosures to the limited partners, a state court
judge in Providence, RI, has rejected conversion and breach of
fiduciary duty claims by several limited partners against two
general partners who negotiated a sale of the partnership's only
asset.  Epstein et al. v. Dimeo et al., No. 94-2368 (RI Super.
Ct., Providence Cty.).

     In 1978, the plaintiffs bought a limited partnership unit in
a partnership that built, maintained and managed a housing
development.  In 1991, the general partners notified the limited
partners of a purchase offer.  Under the offer, the partnership
would receive payment partly in cash and partly in a 15-year
unsecured nonrecourse note; in addition, the general partners
would separately sell their management rights.

     It took two years, repeated solicitations to the limited
partners and modification of the offer before the general
partners obtained the consent of the required two-thirds of the
15 partnership units.

     The plaintiffs filed a Superior Court complaint alleging
breach of the partnership agreement, violation of the Rhode
Island Limited Partnership Act, breach of fiduciary duty,
conversion and unjust enrichment.

     A defense motion for summary judgment was granted.  First,
the court found no provision in the agreement or statute that
prohibited the general partners from accumulating the required
consents through repeated solicitations.

     Next, it found no breach of fiduciary duty because the
general partners fully disclosed all material facts regarding the
transaction.  The letters sent to the limited partners clearly
indicated how the proceeds of the sale were to be allocated.

     Third, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that
unanimous consent of the partnership units was required before
the nonrecourse note could be distributed.  Acceptance of the
nonrecourse note did not increase the limited partners' personal
liability, so unanimous approval was not necessary, the court
said.

MO COURT: PARTNERS CAN BE
SUED FOR INTERFERING WITH
BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS

     Two partners who made false financial-related statements
about their other partners and their corporation to banks can be
sued for intentional interference with the corporation's business
expectations, the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  21
West Inc. et al. v. Meadowgreen Trails Inc. et al., No. 65978
(MO Ct. App.).

     In a unanimous decision, the panel said the defendants used
improper tactics to safeguard their own economic interests.

     The complex litigation involved Joe and Carol Layton, their
ex-partners John and Ann Gorse and several interlocking
corporations involved in land development and home construction.
Relations between the Laytons and the Gorses deteriorated,
including a dispute over who would be officers of Meadowgreen
Trails Inc., a development company of which each couple owned
50%; the Gorses prevailed.

     The Laytons and their corporation, 21 West, filed a petition
in equity to liquidate Meadowgreen and filed a notice of lis
pendens as to property owned by the company.  There also were
claims against the Gorses individually.

     The Laytons wrote to all financial institutions and banks in
the St. Louis phone book, objecting to any loans made to
Meadowgreen or to the Gorses on behalf of Meadowgreen.  At least
two banks had prior dealings with the company, and one bank cited
the Laytons' letter in denying a $475,000 loan to Meadowgreen.

     The Laytons and 21 West filed a petition in St. Louis County
Circuit Court alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of corporate funds,
intentional interference with business expectancies, liquidation
and other causes of action.  Meadowgreen and the Gorses
counterclaimed, alleging tortious interference and other causes
of action.

     After a bench trial, Judge Herbert Lasky awarded the Laytons
$1.582 million for their share of Meadowgreen.  At the same time,
he offset that award in full for what he assessed the Laytons as
owing Meadowgreen and the Gorses for intentional interference,
breach of fiduciary duty and trespass.  He also ordered the
Laytons to convey their interest in Meadowgreen to the
corporation.  Cross-appeals were filed.

     The Court of Appeals, Eastern District, modified slightly in
an opinion by Judge Gary Gaertner.

     The panel upheld the offset, saying the trial judge could
disregard the corporate entity where justice requires.  The
Laytons controlled and were sole shareholders, directors and
officers of one of the corporations that committed misconduct, it
said.  In addition, it cited an exception to the general
requirement for mutuality of parties in setoffs where there is no
prejudice and where a setoff discharges a judgment against a
nonmutual party.

     Next, it upheld the Laytons' liability for tortious
interference, finding sufficient evidence that their letters to
the banks contained factual misrepresentations about Meadowgreen
and that the Laytons used improper means to protect their
interest in Meadowgreen.  There also was enough evidence of
Meadowgreen's valid business expectancy, which the Laytons knew
about, and of damages, it held.

     The trial judge's decision was modified to make parts of the
award in favor of Meadowgreen rather than in favor of the Gorses
individually.

     On other issues, the court upheld the Laytons' liability for
breach of contract in connection with the sale of lots,
prejudgment interest and unjust enrichment.  The Laytons'
challenge to the award of contempt damages was dismissed because
there was no attempt to execute on that order.

     Counsel were Michael F. Roche and Thomas Cummings of St.
Louis for the Laytons and John L. Gianoulakis and Lori J. Baskins
of St. Louis for Meadowgreen.

NC JUDGE SAYS STATE COURT
SHOULD DECIDE DIRECTOR
LIABILITY FOR DEFAMATION

     A federal judge in North Carolina on Nov. 29 ruled that a
state court should hear a defamation and emotional distress suit
against Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc., Rev. Pat
Robertson, the executive director of Christian Coalition and
corporate directors of CBN.  Peterson et al. v. Robertson et al.,
No. 6:95CV00450 (MD NC).

     The judge rejected a defense argument that one officer had
been fraudulently joined in an effort to avoid complete
diversity.

     Mark Peterson was hired as a supervisor in a CBN subsidiary
that sold discount coupon books, long-distance phone service,
vacation rentals and other consumer services.  He was promoted in
November 1991 by Robertson to president of the subsidiary,
American Benefits Plus, but was fired in December 1992 when the
directors became concerned about finances and customer
complaints.

     Critical comments about Peterson were made in an August 1993
press release from Robertson, in a September 1994 "Prime Time
Live" interview with Ralph Reed, executive director of
Robertson's Christian Coalition, and in a September 1994 letter
from CBN to "Prime Time Live"; the comments referred to
Peterson's business operations and alleged theft of donor lists
and documents for personal profit.

     A complaint was filed in state court against CBN, Reed, the
directors and Robertson, alleging defamation, emotional distress
and loss of consortium.  The defense removed the case to the
Middle District of North Carolina, asserting that director Paul
A. Holcombe Jr. was a North Carolina resident who had been
fraudulently joined as a defendant to defeat diversity.

     Judge James A. Beaty Jr. granted Peterson's motion to remand
to state court, finding a lack of complete diversity.  Holcombe
was not fraudulently joined, and it is possible for Peterson to
prevail against him on the merits in state court, the judge held.
Holcombe belonged to the board from September 1993 to March 1995
and can be held liable for corporate acts or breach of his
statutory duty during that period.

     The complaint adequately pled facts in support of Peterson's
defamation claim against Holcombe based on statements by Reed and
the letter from Robertson and CBN to "Prime Time Live," allegedly
authorized and ratified during Holcombe's tenure on the board,
Judge Beaty said.

     As for defense arguments that Holcombe is immune from suit
under Virginia law as a director of a tax-exempt corporation, the
judge found a material factual issue as to whether Holcombe was
compensated for his services and whether CBN is tax-exempt.

BANK OWNER WAS NOT
'UNJUSTLY ENRICHED,'
SUP. CT. RESPONDENT SAYS

     Robert D. Rapaport, a majority shareholder in Great Life
Savings Association, should not be liable under 12 U.S.C. Section
1818(b)(6)(A) for failing to honor the bank's net worth agreement
because the government produced no evidence that he was "unjustly
enriched" in the process, Rapaport argued in a Dec. 11 brief
opposing a U.S. Supreme Court certiorari petition filed last
month by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).  U.S. Dept. of
the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision v. Rapaport, No. 95-
738 (U.S.) see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Nov. 16, 1994.

     Rapaport had personally guaranteed Great Life's net worth by
signing a net worth maintenance agreement with OTS.  However, he
refused to pay the agreed-upon monies when the bank's funds
dropped below minimum federal levels.

     "[Section] 1818(b)(6)(A) requires evidence of unjust
enrichment " a personal benefit, something more than a failure to
make a monetary payment under contracts " as a prerequisite to
the recovery of money in an administrative proceeding," Rapaport
argued.

     In 1984, Great Life was seeking federal depositors
insurance.  The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which was later
succeeded by OTS, approved Great Life's application for insurance
with one caveat " Rapaport, who owned 70% of the bank's stock,
was required to guarantee the bank's net worth.

     The bank's net worth, however, dipped below minimum federal
levels and in 1989 the OTS notified Rapaport that he was
obligated to shore up the bank's weak financial condition.
Rapaport failed to make the requested payments and the following
year OTS filed an administrative proceeding to collect the money.

     In 1993, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Rapaport
liable for violating the agreement.  The OTS acting director
affirmed the ALJ's decision, finding that Rapaport's failure to
honor the agreement had unjustly enriched him under Section
1818(b)(6)(A).  The acting director said that Rapaport had been
unjustly enriched by retaining the money he had promised to pay.

     The District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in
reversing the OTS decision, said that a definition of "unjust
enrichment" was limited to personal benefit under common law
torts.  Under this reading, the D.C. Circuit found that
Rapaport's failure to pay did not evidence that he had gained
personally.  The OTS filed for certiorari.

     "OTS cannot show unjust enrichment in this case, because
Respondent reaped no personal benefit," Rapaport's opposition
brief argues.  "If OTS has a remedy against Respondent, that
remedy lies in an Article III court, not in an administrative
forum.  To hold otherwise would be to give OTS an unfettered
power to engage in administrative enforcement, and that is a
power Congress never intended it to have."

     Rapaport is represented by Frank J. Eisenhart, Arthur W.
Leibold Jr., Julia J. Tyler and Neil R. Crowley of Dechert, Price
& Rhoads, Washington, DC.  The OTS is represented by Carolyn J.
Buck, Thomas J. Segal and Aaron B. Kahn, Washington, DC.

OFFICER ARGUES THAT NASD
EXCEEDED AUTHORITY IN CASE
INVOLVING NONMEMBER FIRM

     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned a
securities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in a
Nov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
that the National Association of Securities Dealers stretched
beyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involving
a misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securities
and Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).

     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceeds
the power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks to
impose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investment
banking or securities business for his alleged failure to act in
his corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"
according to the brief.

     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-
based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument on
allegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporations
law by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-
chartered, non-NASD member private business.

     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reserved
under the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued.
"Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law and
the relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to state
law....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs of
private corporations and federal law shall not intrude into those
internal affairs."

     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for
$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrine
corporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-
owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.
(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check for
the full amount to the AIFC customer.

     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld payment
for two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation was
unsupported.

     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of a
disciplinary action against Alderman by the District Business
Conduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being an
officer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vice
president.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC found
Alderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.

    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of his
business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade."

               According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and fined
him $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD's
National Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed the
DBCC.

     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladder
when Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
review the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealed
to the Ninth Circuit.

      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.
2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law " not
the NASD " governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.
Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371
allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of the
company.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bank
accounts fell to a vice president for finance and not to
Alderman, the brief argued.

      "The standards to which directors are held are established
by state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent and
prudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearly
recognized that the Board's responsibility is limited to
overseeing the operation."

     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.
The SEC is represented by Randall W. Quinn, Senior Litigation
Counsel for the SEC in Washington, DC.

FINES TOTALING $258,000
LEVIED BY NASD AGAINST
WORTHEN RESPONDENTS

     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)
announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000
against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several of
its officers and registered representatives in connection with
the sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,
derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and Related
Cases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).

     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit against
Worthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted as
safe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fund
sales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthen
banks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year along
with Worthen Investments.

     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQ
Stock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.

     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individual
respondents, without admitting or denying the allegations against
them, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by the
Association's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.

     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that they
made, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to their
customers about the characteristics and safety features of the
mutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition to
conducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,
Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligence
in connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fund
products."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies of
all customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintain
an adequate supervisory system.

     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  In
addition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additional
sanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of all
internal policies and an agreement to form an investment
committee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthen
personnel to market all securities.  The committee is to
especially consider the suitability of sales literature to
promote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results of
the independent audit and investment committee reviews are
subject to NASD inspection.

     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,
Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen's
executive vice president and former compliance officer.

     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-year
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in all
capacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he bore
responsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to public
customers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,
NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sent
misleading sales correspondence to public customers that
misstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fund
investments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who use
such correspondence, NASD said.

     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-day
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as a
principal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findings
that he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondence
that misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  In
addition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies of
customer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm's
files and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.

     Higher fines were levied against the seven representatives
who were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highest
amount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,
and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, the
seven representatives were fined $130,900.

     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., which
was the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.

     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with the
investigation "and promptly instituted new policies and
procedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent future
violations."  (Boatmen's changed the name of the Worthen banks
but did not change the name of the investment company after
acquiring the Worthen enterprises.)

CONGRESS OVERRIDES VETO
OF RESTRICTIVE SECURITIES
LITIGATION LEGISLATION

     By a convincing margin, Congress overrode President Bill
Clinton's Dec. 19 veto of legislation restricting shareholders'
lawsuits alleging securities fraud " a bill generally condemned
by trial lawyers and praised by publicly held companies.  "The
Securities Litigation Reform Act," H.R. 1058.  (See Corporate
Officers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995).

     H.R. 1058, The Securities Litigation Reform Act, makes
numerous changes that proponents say will cut down on frivolous
lawsuits.  For example, safe harbors for forward-looking
statements are strengthened, while damage awards for plaintiff
investors are tightened.

     Opponents of the Act, including trial lawyers, regulators
and consumer groups, say the legislation gives companies too much
"wiggle" room while, at the same time, increases risks for small
investors.  Under the Act, for example, companies are less liable
for their forward-looking statements and are under no duty to
make continuing projections.  These kinds of changes, however,
have generally been applauded by high-technology companies.

     The high-tech industry has complained that it is especially
hard hit by frivolous lawsuits because of the unavoidable
volatility of their stock prices.

     An entire section of the Act is reserved for "prevention of
abusive practices that forwent litigation."  The section includes
the elimination of bonus payments to named plaintiffs in class
actions, restrictions on professional plaintiffs, disclosure of
settlement terms to class members, and a prohibition against the
payment of referral fees by attorneys to brokers, dealers or
associated persons.

     The Act also contains a break for accountants, who are often
named as co-defendants, by providing steps to follow for
disclosing wrongdoing and by limiting their liability in fraud
cases.  The Act states, "No independent public accountant shall
be liable in a private action for any finding, conclusion, or
statement expressed in a report made pursuant to paragraph (3)
[Notice To Commission; Response to Failure to Notify] or (4)
[Report After Resignation]."

UZBEKISTAN WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTORS

Uzbekistan has put in place a legal framework conducive to encouraging
foreign investment. Elena Kirillova of McKenna & Co, London summarises
the key aspects of Uzbek legislation which a potential investor will
need to consider.

Uzbekistan is at the crossroads of Central Asia and a landlocked
country completely surrounded by countries which are also landlocked.
Despite its geographical position, since independence in 1991 its
relative political and economic stability, coupled with the
government's encouragement of foreign investment has resulted in a
steady increase in interest from foreign investors.

The legal framework is a key factor in encouraging investment in an
emerging market. In Uzbekistan, legislation has been changing to adapt
to the post-Soviet market reforms.

The Law On Foreign Investments

Article 11 of the Law On Foreign Investment dated 5 May 1994 provides
for a legislative guarantee that where laws are passed adversely
affecting foreign investment, "the laws in force on the day of initial
investment shall be applicable to foreign investments for 10 years".
This provision does not apply to "defence, national security, social
disorder and environmental protection".

This is an ambiguous provision, which can be interpreted as meaning
that such protection can be granted for a period less than 10 years. In
practice, the government authorities in Uzbekistan are interpreting
this provision as applying for a 10 year period.

A foreign investor's rights are "protected by law". Article 7 of the
Law provides that such protection is to be on "no less favourable terms
than those accorded to local entities". However, foreign investments
may be subject to expropriation in the case of "national calamities,
accidents and epidemics".

Compensation "adequate for the damages suffered" will be paid, although
the method for calculating this is not determined by existing
legislation.

Financial regulations and tax

Article 13 of the Law contains guarantees allowing investors to
"transfer abroad profits ... earned from legally authorised activities,
without any restrictions".

However, profits earned locally will not automatically be convertible
into hard currency. Due to government policy and a shortage of hard
currency, converting any significant amounts of local currency is
extremely difficult. Investors' profits can be "reinvested ... or used
in any other manner at the proprietor's discretion".

Accounts may be opened in any currency although the use of foreign
currency is restricted. Cash payments are not allowed and there is a
15% tax on gains from foreign currency sales.

Goods and equipment imported for production purposes or the personal
needs of foreign employees are exempt from customs duties.

Companies which are more than 30% foreign owned and which specialise in
the agricultural, construction and consumer industries are entitled to
a two year holiday from income tax.

Companies included in the Priority Investment Programme are entitled to
a five year income tax holiday. Inclusion in the Priority Investment
Programme is a matter of discretion exercised by the Cabinet of
Ministers.

According to the Enterprise Tax Law of 22 December 1995, the basic rate
of profits tax for companies with less than 30% foreign capital is 37%
and 25% for companies with more than 30% foreign capital.

Exporters receive further benefits in the President's Edict of 18 June
1994 "On measures to stimulate the activity of enterprises towards
broadening of export potential". Under this Edict, income tax is
payable at half the standard rate where exports comprise 30% of a
company's total output.

Additionally, certain benefits are available against tax levied on hard
currency revenues earned from exports, where exports have increased.

Further, export tariffs are reduced by 50% where goods are exported for
hard currency.

The Law On Concessions

The Law On Foreign Investments provides for concessions to be granted
to foreign investors wishing to exploit natural resources. The Law On
Concessions was passed on 30 August 1995 and provides a general
framework for concessions.

Under this Law, concessions are awarded to a company upon winning a
tender organised by the state management bodies of the relevant
industry sector. Also, the Cabinet of Ministers may allow a concession
agreement to be negotiated without a tender. Concession agreements are
usually valid for 15 years, with the possibility of extensions by the
Cabinet of Ministers.

There are some contradictions within the Law On Concessions. For
example, authorisation to enter into a concession is granted
simultaneously by authorised state management bodies and local
management bodies. The Law does not state which has responsibility in
particular circumstances.

Article 8 provides that the Cabinet of Ministers can determine priority
areas of concessionary activity, although no such determination has yet
been made. The registration procedure for concessions has not been
determined, although the Law states that concessions come into effect
from the moment of registration. The taxation regime is also not yet
developed regarding concessions.

It is also not clear if a foreign investor who is party to a concession
agreement is required to form a legal entity in Uzbekistan. Moreover,
some activities permissible under a concession agreement will require
additional licensing.

Legal structures

One of the issues facing foreign investors is the choice of appropriate
legal structure in Uzbekistan.

- Representative offices

Investors who do not propose to undertake income producing activities
can set up an accredited representative office. This is effectively an
extension of the parent company and, as such, has no separate legal
personality.

The kind of activities which a representative office would normally
undertake include the negotiation of co-operation or licensing
agreements on behalf of the parent company, undertaking marketing and
promotional work and by holding an export licence or obtaining visas or
customs exemptions for the parent company and its employees.

Representative offices are not entitled to trade. However,
representative offices can become liable for payment of income tax
where the parent company receives income as a result of its activities
in Uzbekistan.

The parent company will be responsible for the debts and obligations of
its representative office.

- Legal Entities

Two types of corporate structure are commonly used by investors: the
joint stock company and the limited liability company. There are some
notable differences between these structures.

In the case of a joint stock company, the charter fund (share capital)
is divided into shares. Each shareholder is allocated a certain
percentage of these which have a nominal value ascribed to them in the
company's founding documents.

A joint stock company can be either open (where shares are freely
transferable) or closed (where shares are distributed among founders,
and any change in the identity or number of founders will require the
execution of a new founders agreement and the re-registration of the
company).

The Presidential Decree of 21 January 1994 provided that the Cabinet of
Ministers develop a Programme for the Intensification of the
Denationalisation and Privatisation Processes which included enacting
regulations for closed joint stock companies to be transferred to open
joint stock companies. This Edict reflects the presidential policy of
encouraging wide public ownership of shares.

In contrast, limited liability companies do not issue shares. Instead,
each member, or "participant", takes an "interest" in the charter fund.
An interest is akin to a share, with similar rights and obligations
attached. Subject to the terms of legislation and to the founding
documents, "interests" may be sold to other participants, to outside
third parties or they may be redeemed by the company.

The framework of management is also different between the two forms of
company. The minimum requirement for a limited liability company is a
general meeting of participants (to be held at least twice per year)
and a directorate or general director. This latter body acts as the
executive organ of the company with full power to carry out the
decisions of the general meeting and to oversee the day-to-day running
of the business.

A joint stock company is required to have both a general meeting and
directorate or general director as well as a supervisory board. The
specific powers allocated to each of the three organs of the company
and their inter-relationships are to some extent set out in the
relevant company legislation.

However, there is still a degree of uncertainty as to how the three
bodies work in practice and the division of their spheres of
responsibility. For example, the roles of the directorate, which
handles the daily business of the company and is responsible for
implementing executive policies, and the supervisory board, which
oversees the activities of the directorate, seem to overlap and
problems can arise in practice if the founding documents of the company
are not sufficiently specific.

Registration

Both entities must be registered with the Ministry of Justice. In
addition, joint stock companies must register all issues of shares with
the Ministry of Finance and the National Depository, which makes the
accreditation process for such companies more complex.

The initial charter fund for both types of company must be paid in full
within one year of state registration. Each participant in a limited
liability company must pay up 30% of its cash contribution prior to
registration. This requirement does not apply to joint stock companies.

All documents required for the registration of an enterprise in
Uzbekistan should be submitted initially to the Ministry of Justice and
should include a feasibility study of the proposed venture.

If the proposed entity will involve state property, a resolution of the
State Committee for Property and the Support of Entrepreneurship will
be necessary.

However, the accreditation of companies with assets in excess of US$20
million, and all enterprises with 100% foreign investment must also be
notified to the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Ministry of Justice cannot register the company without the prior
approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. In practice, all companies with
foreign investment will require such approval.

Where the investment contemplated is of significant size or of
strategic importance to the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Cabinet of
Ministers may issue a decree approving the investment.

The decree procedure may allow an investor to seek additional
exemptions or guarantees, not available in existing legislation.
Additionally, companies must register with the Ministry for Foreign
Economic Relations when engaged in "overseas economic activity".

Practical considerations

The choice of corporate structure and the availability of additional
exemptions and guarantees will depend on the perceived importance of
the potential foreign investment to the Republic of Uzbekistan. While
the government encourages foreign investment, negotiations can take a
long time, in what is still a developing legislative environment.

A company wishing to invest in Uzbekistan will need to come to grips
with a great body of legislative and regulatory provisions. Each
significant new investment is still something of a precedent for the
Republic of Uzbekistan and there will be aspects which are not properly
regulated in the existing framework, and matters where the legislation
will be silent.

It is thus likely that the enactment of project-specific decrees will
remain a necessary part of structuring foreign investment in Uzbekistan
in the immediate future.

Companies need to be prepared to take an innovative and pragmatic
approach to succeed in this potentially rewarding market.

COMING TO GRIPS WITH SLOVAKIA'S LANGUAGE LAWS

A law regulating the use of the Slovak language is now in force in
Slovakia. Strict implementation of its provisions could lead to
increased costs for some businesses. By John Loughey of Squire Sanders
& Dempsey, Phoenix.

The Act on the State Language of the Slovak Republic (the Language
Law), Act No. 270/1995, passed by the National Council of the Slovak
Republic on 15 November 1995 and signed into law by President Michel
Kovac on 25 November 1995, has generated considerable controversy in
its short life, primarily relating to concerns about the effect of the
new law on Slovakia's Hungarian speaking ethnic minority.

Much less attention has been paid to the effect of the new Language Law
in international business and commerce. Although, for the majority of
businesses, the Language Law is unlikely to have a significant impact,
it may require major adjustments for businesses in certain industries
in Slovakia.

The Language Law, effective since 1 January 1996, provides that Slovak
is the official language in the Slovak Republic and takes priority over
other languages used in the Slovak Republic. It provides that official
use of the Slovak language must be in conformity with the codified form
of the language to be promulgated by the Slovak Ministry of Culture.

The main intent of the Language Law is to require the use of Slovak as
the official language in all government functions.

Although the Language Law specifically states that it is not intended
to regulate the use of languages of national minorities and ethnic
groups, and indeed Premier Vladimir Meciar and his government have
pledged to promulgate regulations dealing with the use of minority
languages, the Language Law's provisions requiring the use of Slovak in
education and government proceedings and making Slovak language ability
a pre-condition for government employment have generated the most
controversy among ethnic minorities.

These provisions are unlikely to be of concern to most foreign
investors. Other provisions of the Language Law, however, may have a
direct effect on certain businesses in Slovakia.

Mass media, broadcasting and publishing

The Language Law will have a significant impact on those businesses
operating in the broadcasting and publishing fields.

It provides that Slovak is the official language to be used in all
radio and television broadcasting in Slovakia. Foreign language radio
and television broadcasting with subtitles in Slovak or "otherwise
satisfying the requirement of basic comprehensibility from the
standpoint of the official language" are permitted, as are broadcasts
of music in the official language, foreign language transmissions by
Slovak Radio intended for foreign countries, and television and radio
broadcasting for the purposes of teaching a foreign language or for
similar purposes. (Presumably, the BBC and similar broadcasters who
broadcast foreign language programming from within Slovakia will be
permitted to continue such broadcasts on the rationale that they are
intended to teach foreign languages.) Radio and television broadcasting
operators, announcers, moderators and editors must use Slovak in their
broadcasts.

The Language Law does not provide any guidelines as to how a broadcast
would "otherwise satisfy the requirement of basic comprehensibility".

However, the "basic comprehensibility" exceptions in the Language Law
were added by last minute amendments as a result of lobbying by Czech
language interests.

It appears, therefore, that the intention of the exceptions is to
permit Czech language broadcasts. The Slovak language is similar to
Czech and many broadcasters in Slovakia use Czech subtitles or dubbing
on other foreign language programming. This practice will apparently be
permitted under the Language Law.

If strictly enforced, however, the Language Law may still have a
drastic effect on television broadcasting and cable companies operating
from within Slovakia. A strict interpretation of the Language Law would
prohibit local cable operators from retransmitting on their cable
systems such popular foreign language satellite programming as the
English language CNN or the German language RTL Plus without Slovak or
Czech dubbing or subtitling.

In addition, Slovak broadcasters would be unable to broadcast
programming from such international services without dubbing or
subtitling. Given the cost and practical difficulties of dubbing or
subtitling, Slovak broadcasters and cable operators, if faced with
strict enforcement, are likely to discontinue such programming, thereby
reducing the range of choices available to Slovak viewers. (The Slovak
National Council is currently considering a bill that would apply
similar restrictions to video taped films distributed in Slovakia.
Provided Czech dubbing or subtitling is permitted for these films, the
practical effect of the proposed law is likely to be minimal, because
most major video taped films distributed in Slovakia are either
subtitled or dubbed in Czech or Slovak).

Further, programming for children up to the age of 12 must be dubbed in
Slovak. Subtitles are not permitted nor is Czech dubbing. As a result,
the range of children's programming available in Slovakia may be
reduced.

As with the broadcast industries, the print and publishing industry
will be affected by the Language Law, which provides that periodical
and non-periodical publications must be published in Slovak. The "basic
comprehensibility" exception does not apply to such publications.
Consequently, publishing companies may face the additional expense of
producing Slovak translations of publications when, in the past, they
have sold only the Czech translation in Slovakia.

Lectures, seminars and cultural events

Organisations that sponsor lectures, seminars or other educational,
training or cultural events will also be affected by the Language Law.
Such events must be held in Slovak or, if in another language, in a
manner in which the "basic comprehensibility from the standpoint of the
official language is satisfied".

Again, the Language Law provides no guidance as to what meets the
requirement of "basic comprehensibility". Presumably, however,
translations of foreign language presentations into Slovak should
satisfy this requirement in addition to presentations in Czech.

An exception is provided for touring foreign artists, cultural events
of national minorities and ethnic groups, and musical works in their
original language, provided such programs are first introduced in
Slovak. (Paradoxically, the Language Law would permit Slovak rock bands
to perform the music of an American rap group in English, but would ban
a Slovak based theatre group from performing Shakespeare in English).

Participants at lectures have the right to express themselves and
present speeches in Slovak. Printed materials for cultural events and
other special occasions, including programs for cinemas, theatres and
concerts must be issued in Slovak. They may, however, contain
translations in other languages.

If the Language Law is strictly enforced, those organisations that
sponsor seminars and lectures in Slovakia may face additional expenses
in these operations. These organisations may be required to provide
Slovak translators for any programs held in Slovakia, even if all
participants in the program are fluent in the foreign language in which
the program is conducted.

Contracts and similar documents

The Language Law will require several types of contracts and other
documents to be in Slovak that the parties might not otherwise execute
in Slovak.

All employment contracts and other agreements related to labour
relations must be in Slovak. This requirement would apply even in
employment contracts between a foreign-owned Slovak company and its
Slovak resident foreign employee if those contracts are entered into in
Slovakia.

All financial and technical documentation must be in Slovak. Although
the requirement prior to the Language Law was that financial statements
used for official purposes such as tax returns were to be prepared in
Slovak, other financial statements, such as those prepared according to
international accounting standards and used for international purposes,
were often prepared only in English and another foreign language.

The official language of court proceedings will, of course, be Slovak,
and non-Slovak speaking foreigners will continue to have a right to use
interpreters.

Of major significance to international business, however, is the new
requirement that, in any proceeding before public authorities
(including courts) relating to a contract, only the Slovak version of
the contract will be recognised.

It is common practice in international transactions for the contracts
to be prepared either in both a foreign language and in Slovak, with
the foreign language version controlling, or only in the foreign
language.

The Language Law mandates that the court must recognise only the Slovak
language version of the contract, despite any clear expression that the
intent of the parties is to the contrary.

This provision of the Language Law may lead to an increased use of
arbitration in international transactions in an effort to avoid the
application of this particular provision of the Language Law.

Product packaging and documentation

The Language Law requires that all information and documentation for
consumer goods, foods and medicines, including the listing of the
contents, instructions for their use, and warranty conditions, be in
Slovak. Presumably, this documentation may also be in other languages.

This particular provision would not be a major change from existing
practice for most (but not all) importers. Most importers provide
Slovak language documentation in order to reach the widest possible
market in Slovakia. This provision of the Language Law would, however,
prohibit the use of Czech documentation in place of Slovak language
documentation, as has sometimes been the practice for companies in
order to save the cost of translating materials into Slovak.

Computer software

The provisions of the Language Law relating to product documentation
may have a major impact on producers and distributors of computer
software, although the Language Law has no provisions expressly
applicable to computer software. According to Milan Ferko, the Director
of the Section of State Languages and Scripts of the Slovak Ministry of
Culture, (the ministry with responsibility for supervising compliance
with the Language Law), producers and distributors of computer software
must provide Slovak versions of computer programs. In addition, the
computer programs must permit the use of the Slovak alphabet. This
requirement may limit Slovakia's access to new programs when the
expense of developing a Slovak language version is deemed to be too
high by the software producer.

Advertising

Signs, advertisements and notices in stores, sporting arenas, cafes,
streets, airports, train stations and means of public transport must be
in Slovak. Other languages may be included, provided such other
languages follow the Slovak text and are not larger than the Slovak
text. The current practice of some advertisers of using slogans in a
foreign language only will no longer be permitted. This will require
advertising campaigns especially developed for the Slovak market.
Further, the Slovak language must be used even if the advertising is
directed solely to foreigners, as is commonly seen in advertising at
airports.

Penalties for violations

Although the Language Law came into effect on 1 January 1996, the
provisions of the Language Law relating to penalties for its violation
will not come into effect until 1 January 1997. After 1 January 1997,
the Ministry of Culture will have the authority to impose fines up to
SKK 250,000 (US$8,500) for most violations. For violations of the
provisions imposed upon broadcasters relating to children's programming
and local television and radio broadcasting, fines can be imposed up to
SKK 500,000.

Increasing the costs of business

Despite the controversy concerning the effect of the Law on minorities
in Slovakia, the Language Law will not have a significant impact on
most businesses.

In some instances, however, the new Language Law, if strictly enforced,
may increase the cost of doing business in Slovakia because of
requirements for translation into Slovak of documentation, broadcast
programming, lectures and presentations, advertising and, possibly,
computer software programs. Given the relatively small market of Slovak
speakers, some businesses may feel that the additional cost thus
imposed is unjustified and decide to forego the Slovak market as a
result. Other businesses might pass the increased cost on to Slovak
consumers. As with the effect of the law on minorities, the real impact
of the Language Law will depend on how it is implemented and enforced.

BULGARIA: NEW EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SET TO BE INTRODUCED

The government has issued new trade regulations containing revised
restrictions on the import and export of commodities.

The main features are as follows:

- export of the following products are banned until the end of this
year:- wheat, flour, cooking oil, oil-bearing crops and crops used for
animal feed. The ban on wheat exports is likely to create problems for
Bulgaria in its efforts to join the World Trade Organisation;

- new quotas have been set for duty free imports of wheat, flour,
maize, sunflower seeds and beef while there are no longer any quotas on
ice cream imports;

- imports of sausages and powdered milk must be registered;

- in accordance with its obligations under EU trade agreements, customs
duties on Bulgarian industrial goods to the EU will be abolished this
year. Textiles are, however, not included and will continue to attract
duties at least until 1997;

- the ban on the export of some metals (eg, zinc, aluminium and nickel)
will be replaced by export duties. Trade in metals with the EU is
subject to licensing requirements while scrap exports remain banned;
and

- EU quotas on the import of live sheep and live goats have been
increased.

MOLDOVA: DEVELOPMENT OF SECURITIES MARKET AND STOCK EXCHANGE

Integral to the success of Moldova's mass privatisation programme,
which has entered its second phase, is the development of a functioning
stock market.

The Moldova Stock Exchange (MSE) opened in May last year with five
listed companies. That number is expected to grow as privatised and
other qualifying companies seek listings.

A legislative framework has also emerged, although a number of
significant changes are in the pipeline. Preparation began with the May
1993 Law on Circulation of Securities and Stock Exchanges (as amended,
the Securities Law) which creates a basic framework of securities
market regulation. Recently ratified amendments to this law, along with
corresponding amendments (still awaiting passage) to the Law On Joint
Stock Companies (the JSC Law), reflect anticipated use by companies of
stock market mechanisms. A more comprehensive securities law is under
consideration, although its passage has been delayed by debate over the
establishment and operation of over-the-counter markets.

Scope of Securities Law

Securities are defined as instruments representing equity rights and
certain debt obligations, which usually provide the holder with
periodic or defined dividend or interest payments and are transferable.

Securities may exist in materialised or dematerialised (book-entry)
form, and may be issued in registered or bearer form. The exchange of
securities includes their purchase and sale and other activities
defined by law where a change of ownership is or may be effected (which
would embrace such instruments as options or futures contracts).

Securities registries must be maintained to reflect the issuance,
exchange and pledge of securities.

Competent securities issuers are joint stock companies, banks and state
bodies, although others may be designated by law. Subject to certain
regulatory requirements, foreign institutions and individuals may
participate in the market on a par with Moldovan entities.

Only specified domestic securities may be issued or circulate in the
Moldovan market under the Securities Law. These include shares and
bonds issued by joint stock companies, bonds issued by other types of
enterprises and such other securities designated by the SCSM.

Foreign-issued securities may also be allowed onto the Moldovan market,
although this is subject to a number of regulatory requirements
including authorisation from the National Bank of Moldova.

Other forms of securities include:

- government bonds;
- treasury or treasury-like bonds;
- bank certificates;
- promissory notes and bills of exchange;
- other documentary evidences of commercial obligation; and
- special MPP enterprise-specific securities.

The following are not debt security instruments:

- simple debt receipts;
- testamentary dispositions;
- lottery tickets; and
- insurance policies.

The issuance of state securities is regulated by the Ministry of
Finance and the NBM, and their exchange by the Securities Law. Some
bank-related securities, such as bills of exchange, may be under NBM
jurisdiction.

Chief among the Securities Law amendments is the creation of securities
registry systems. A registry must contain details of owners or nominal
holders of securities. Amendments to the JSC Law set out obligations of
joint stock companies in relation to the establishment and maintenance
of registries. Issuers may maintain their own registries or use the
services of an independent SCSM-licensed registrar. Nominal securities
holders, who must also be SCSM-registered, may also perform registry
functions. Securities transfers are valid only when all registration
requirements under the law have been completed.

Securities issuance

Securities issues must be registered with the SCSM and given a public
file number. Thirty days prior to registration of the issue, the
following documents must be submitted to the SCSM:

- the registration application describing security type, quantity and
face value;

- an extract from Ministry of Justice Enterprises Registry certifying
the issuer's existence;

- certified copies of the issuer's constituent documents;

- security specimens; and

- the issue prospectus.

The prospectus must be approved by the SCSM prior to distribution to
potential investors. The SCSM will review the prospectus, which must be
current to within three months of publication, and may require
additions or deletions to it.

A copy of the prospectus must be made available to each interested
investor. Any amendments made during the securities offering period
must approved by the SCSM and provided to investors holding prospectus
copies. During the initial offering period (which is not defined),
securities must be sold at face value. The SCSM may suspend or declare
invalid an issue in the event of a breach of legislation, false
information in the prospectus or a material change in the condition of
the issuer or issue terms and conditions. This decision is subject to
judicial review. The Securities Law sets out detailed reporting
requirements, which include keeping details of all corporate activities
and filing annual reports with the SCSM.

Securities exchange

Securities exchange activities may only be undertaken by persons
licensed by the SCSM. Banks and companies whose sole corporate activity
is securities dealing may apply for a trading licence from the SCSM.
They must be able to demonstrate professional competence in the
activities they wish to pursue and may not be more than 10% owned or
controlled by another SCSM licence holder.

A bank may engage in dealing for its own account only and may not deal
in securities of issuers which are bank customers or clients.

Recent amendments to the Securities Law and JSC Law concern large-scale
securities issues, the operation of independent registries, over-the-
counter trading and disclosure requirements.

A large-scale securities issue is one where the number of registered
securities holders exceeds 300 (individual shareholders of nominees
counting against the limit).

Open joint stock companies involved in such issues must register the
issue with the MSE. Issuers of such securities are obliged to contract
responsibility for issuance and exchange registration activities to an
SCSM-licensed independent registrar. Such a registrar is defined by
amendments to the JSC Law as a legal person whose sole corporate
activity is engaging in issuance and registry activities. An
independent registrar is precluded from transacting in client
securities or sub-contracting any of its clients' responsibilities.

OTC exchange activity in large scale securities issues by joint stock
companies must be performed by the SCSM licensed persons who must
report to the regulator the manner and volume of trades executed.
Disclosure requirements, which are still to be determined by the
government, will bind persons engaged in securities issuance and
dealing.

The stock exchange

The MSE is established as a closed joint stock company and is therefore
subject to the JSC Law in relation to internal corporate governance.

Stock exchange activities are subject to SCSM supervision.

Founders of the Moldova Stock Exchange, whose number shall not exceed
ten, must be SCSM-licensed market participants.

The founders must establish a general guaranty fund to which exchange
members must contribute. Assets of the fund may not be used to cover
the general debt obligations of an exchange member (except as
prescribed by exchange regulations) where membership is terminated
because of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise. The MSE has a priority
claim over the former member's guaranty share to satisfy obligations
associated with exchange activity.

MSE members must be SCSM-licensed market participants. They must
satisfy MSE regulations regarding financial and operational capacity
and agree to abide by the MSE charter and rules.

Members are not obliged to hold shares in the MSE. Membership may be
sold or voluntarily relinquished. The MSE may cancel a member's
licence, suspend its activities or revoke membership for failure to
abide by MSE regulations. Appeal lies with the SCSM.

MSE income is used to defray exchange operational expenses. Conflict of
interest provisions prohibit the holding of management or other
official positions in the MSE by persons holding shares in a MSE
member.

No MSE employee may also be employed by a securities issuer, including
government treasury bond issuers.

The MSE shall cease to exist by a vote of the general assembly of
shareholders, where membership falls below ten persons and within the
preceding six months no new members have been admitted, or upon SCSM
revocation of the MSE's licence.

Investor protection

Investors are protected against losses suffered as a result of false
information provided to them in the initial share offering -
presumably, only by reference to the issuer's published prospectus.

Where a licensed market participant knowingly certifies as true false
information on the issuer, the participant and the issuer shall be
liable to the investor. Investor remedies include compensation or,
where the investor files the claim within a month of the affected
securities purchase, revocation of the securities sales contract. As
regards initial share issues, the issuer and other market participants
involved in the transaction must maintain purchase monies received by
them in escrow until such time as they are satisfied that no violation
of the investor protection provisions is likely to occur. A person
purchasing 5% or more of a company's voting stock or increasing an
existing holding through voting share purchases by 5% or more, must
report such activity within five days of its occurrence to the SCSM.

Joint stock companies purchasing their own stock on the open market
must inform the SCSM within 15 days of the completed transaction.

As regards open market share buy-backs by joint stock companies, the
proposed amendments to the JSC Law requires the company charter to
specifically authorise such buy-backs as well as approval of the action
by the board of directors. The board may only approve the buy-back
where the company is unlikely to become insolvent or where the buy-back
would not provoke insolvency. Repurchased shares must be retired to
treasury. A company may not purchase shares in a primary issue. The
foregoing directives are not specifically provided for, but may be
deduced from current JSC Law read with the Securities Law and general
civil law principles of corporate governance.

Insider trading is prohibited to certain listed categories of persons
associated with an issuer, subject to an exception clause which
seriously undermines the prohibition's effect.

Persons having access to "official information" (an undefined term) of
an issuer, who are forbidden from engaging in insider trading activity,
are categorised as follows:

- "issuers authorities", a grouping which includes member of a
company's supervisory council or board of directors and administrative
personnel;

- officials engaged in auditing functions in connection with issuers or
the MSE;

- SCSM authorities or officials; and

- authorities and officials of the MSE and professional SCSM-licensed
market participants.

"Authorities" and "members" are not defined. Such persons and members
of their families may purchase securities of associated issuers
provided that they sell or transfer them within six months of purchase.
Banks issuing securities may not provide credit to investors in those
securities. It is prohibited to disseminate false information about an
issuer with a view to profiting from a resultant share price swing.

Investors suffering losses may bring a claim against the individual or
company disseminating the information by reference to as yet undrafted
legislation. Any pledge of securities must be recorded in the issuer's
share registry.

Securities watchdog

The SCSM is the main regulator with its mandate expanded under
Securities Law amendments giving it wider regulatory and investigatory
powers.

Recently added powers include:

- approving new MSE rules;

- investigative authority over activities by market participants with a
view to uncovering or pursuing suspected irregularities or illicit
behaviour, coupled with documentary and written deposition subpoena
powers; and

- certain proactive remedial powers.

Appeal from SCSM orders lies with the general and arbitral courts by
reference to the order's terms.

Transitional provisions

The government is directed to submit draft amendments to the JSC Law to
Parliament for approval and to bring regulations under the JSC Law and
Securities Law into compliance with the amended Laws.

As mentioned, amendments to the JSC Law are still under discussion.
Regulations are being updated to reflect recent changes to the
Securities Law and discussions on a second wholly redrafted securities
law are well advanced.

RUSSIA: REGISTRATION IN ST PETERSBURG

Russian companies with foreign investment located in St Petersburg
(including their branches and representative offices), as well as
branch offices of foreign companies, are now registered in the same
manner as most other local Russian commercial entities by the St
Petersburg Registration Chamber.

Under prior legislation, companies with foreign investment and branches
and representative offices of foreign companies were registered at a
separate registration chamber at the Committee of Foreign Relations of
the Mayor's Office (the CFR). Now only representative offices of
foreign legal entities need be CFR registered.

The new registration process has formally been in effect since the
publication on 25 July 1995 of the Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg
Executive Organs in Relation to State Registration of Juridical
Entities as well as Physical Persons Engaged in Individual Commercial
Activities Not Having Formed a Juridical Entity in the Form of an
Individual Enterprise (Order 692-p), which attaches the new Regulation
of the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber. However, its provisions
were not implemented immediately and its interpretation by the
Registration Chamber and CFR became clear only recently.

Order 692-p establishes that the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber
has responsibility for registering and maintaining a unified registry
of all new and reorganised juridical entities in St. Petersburg
(including those with foreign investment) as well as branches and their
representative offices, including the branch offices (but not
representative offices) of foreign entities. Specifically included in
the competence of the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber is the right
to register all of the aforementioned entities as well as to confirm
either the amendments to the foundation documents or the liquidation
balance in case of the dissolution of any entities previously
registered by the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber or the CFR.

As to the timing of the registration process, previously, the CFR
reviewed the application documentation over a 21-day period in
accordance with the provisions of the Law on Foreign Investment in the
RSFSR of 4 July 1991 and the Regulations on the Order of Registration
of Enterprises with Foreign Investment on the Territory of St.
Petersburg as attached to Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg no. 219-
p of 14 March 1994 On the Registration of Enterprises with Foreign
Investment which Order 692-p partially repeals.

Subsequently, the legality of this waiting period was brought into
question by Decree No. 1482 of the President of 8 July 1994 On the
Order of State Registration of the Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity
(Decree 1482) which requires that the registration organ complete the
registration process no later than three days after submission of the
required documentation.

The wording of Order 692-p appears to ignore Decree 1482, by implicitly
granting to the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber the right to review
application documentation over a 21-day waiting period as well.
Experience since the publication of Order 692-p has been that in some
cases, where all documents have been in order, registrations have been
completed within several days following their submission. The
documentation required to register a Russian company with foreign
investment (including its branch and representative offices) or a
branch office of a foreign company remains unchanged, except for the
application letter, which must now be addressed to the St. Petersburg
Registration Chamber. Also, as before, companies having foreign
investment in the charter capital exceeding Rbs 100 million must
complete the registration process at the Registration Chamber of the
Ministry of Economics in Moscow.

PERSONAL LIABILITY
FOR ADA VIOLATION
REJECTED BY VA COURT

     An individual supervisor cannot be held personally liable
for personnel decisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), a federal judge in Alexandria, VA, ruled on Dec. 17,
granting summary judgment in favor of a supervisor accused of
discriminatory remarks and behavior.  Stephens v. Kay Management
Co. Inc. et al., No. 95cv470-A (ED VA).

     The judge rejected the plaintiff's argument that the
supervisor qualified as an "employer" under the ADA because of
the supervisor's role as an agent of the employer who exercised
significant control over hiring, firing or conditions of
employment.  He said that the "agent" wording of the statute
merely incorporated the principles of respondeat superior, not
exposure to personal liability in discrimination cases.

     Plaintiff Marian Stephens worked in management positions for
Kay Management Co., a real estate management firm, from 1983
until 1993.  A 1992 stroke affected her ability to walk and climb
stairs but did not prevent her from those activities, which were
part of her job as a resident manager of an apartment complex in
Fairfax, VA.

     According to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia complaint, the property manager, Stephens'
supervisor, made comments about Stephens' "handicap" and refused
to allow Stephens to accompany her and a male employee on walking
tours of the property.  Stephens was terminated despite the
absence of prior performance complaints and without the warning
or counseling required by Kay Management's employment policies.
A person 20 years younger than Stephens was then hired to replace
her.

     The complaint named the company and property manager, Susan
Pool, as defendants.

     Judge Robert E. Payne granted the property manager's motion
for summary judgment by dismissing the complaint against her.

     There is no individual liability on a supervisor for
employment-related decisions of a plainly delegable nature, he
said, unless the supervisor also independently meets the ADA
definition of "employer."  He cited case law in which courts
reached a similar conclusion under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act and Title VII.

     In addition, Congress could have directly imposed new and
expansive liability for individuals in the statutory definition
of "employer," he said, rejecting the argument that Congress did
so by implication through ADA provisions regarding recoverable
compensatory and punitive damages.

     At the same time, he said, absolving the property manager of
personal liability does not encourage discrimination because of
the employer's respondeat superior liability.

     Candace S. McCall of Fairfax appeared for Stephens.  David
M. Estabrook of Gordon Estabrook & Yenas in McLean represented
the defendants.

11TH CIR. SAYS FAILURE
TO HIRE MAY HAVE VIOLATED
RIGHTS OF GAY WOMAN

     The withdrawal of an offer of employment by a Georgia state
agency to an openly homosexual candidate may have violated her
intimate association rights and her right of expressive
association, a divided 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled
on Dec. 20, vacating a lower court grant of summary judgment to
the defendant in the case.  Shahar v. Bowers, No. 93-9345
(11th Cir.).

     The majority concluded that the district court should apply
strict scrutiny to a review of whether the decision to withdraw
the job offer when the candidate announced her intention to
engage in a religious marriage ceremony with her partner was
"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest."

     Joy Shahar was offered and accepted a job with the
Department of Law of the State of Georgia.  Before she began
work, she announced her intention to engage in a marriage
ceremony with her female companion.  The attorney general of
Georgia learned of her plans and terminated the offer of
employment by letter in July 1991.  He stated that he could not
approve of "this purported marriage," as doing so would
"jeopardize the proper function of this office."

     Shahar filed suit in October 1991 against the AG under
42 U.S.C. Section 1983, alleging violation of her right of
intimate association, of her freedom of religion, and of equal
protection and substantive due process.  She claimed that
engaging in a religious ceremony recognized by the
Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, to which she adheres,
conferred upon her and her partner a religious-based status which
was separate from civil marriage in Georgia, which does not
recognize same-gender marriages.  The U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia entered summary judgment for the AG.

     The appeals court panel, in a majority opinion delivered by
Senior Judge John Godbold, concluded that the district court had
erred in applying a balancing test to determine whether Shahar's
right to intimate association had been violated.  However, the
court affirmed summary judgment for the AG on Shahar's free
expression and equal protection claims.

     Judge Godbold first emphasized that Shahar's intimate
association claim was based in a long-standing commitment to
religious principles; that she and her partner were active in
their synagogue; and that the couple had been counseled by a
rabbi prior to their marriage.  He stated that, while the
marriage between Shahar and her partner did not involve marriage
in a civil, legal sense, it was "inextricably entwined with
Shahar's exercise of her religious beliefs."  Therefore, that
intimate relationship was constitutionally protected, and
deserved strict scrutiny, not a balancing test review, he said.

     Next, the court remanded Shahar's expressive association
claim, on a finding that the district court erred in not
addressing the issue because of its overlap with her free
exercise claim, and the court's conclusion that the expressive
association claim required no greater constitutional protection
than her intimate association claim.  Judge Godbold noted that
the right of expressive association " the right to associate for
the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the
First Amendment, including religious expression " may be limited
by regulations which serve a compelling state interest.

     Senior Judge Lewis Morgan concurred in part, taking issue
with Judge Godbold's opinion that Shahar's association and equal
protection claims require strict scrutiny.  He stated that Shahar
had not presented an equal protection claim based on a
fundamental right of religious freedom.  In addition, the
evidence does not support an equal protection claim because the
job offer was not revoked because of Shahar's sexual orientation
but because the AG believed that she invoked the legal and civil
significance of being married to another female, which is
inconsistent with Georgia law.

     Judge Phyllis Kravitch concurred in part and dissented in
part.  She stated that, although she disagreed with the
majority's holding that strict scrutiny ought to be applied in
this case, applying a balancing test led her to conclude that the
emotional and religious bond between Shahar and her partner is
entitled to constitutional protection.  Although the "unique
status" of the AG's office made this a close case for Judge
Kravitch, Shahar's "constitutional interest in pursuing her
intimate association outweighed any threat to the efficient
operation of the Georgia Department of Law," she stated.

VA COURT SAYS SUPERVISOR
MAY BE PERSONALLY LIABLE
FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT

     A supervisor may be held personally liable for sexual
harassment in a Title VII case, a federal judge in Roanoke, VA,
has decided.  Frye v. Virginia Transformer Corp. et al.,
No. 95-0399-R (WD VA).

     The court concluded that a supervisor can be held liable for
sexual harassment where (1) the supervisor has a significant
degree of control over the employee and (2) the sexual harassment
is conducted by the supervisor for his own benefit and not for
that of his employer.

     Defendant Jeff Clark was one of Sarah Frye's supervisors at
Virginia Transformer Corp.  He allegedly sexually touched Frye
and made suggestive sexual comments; he also reportedly sexually
harassed other female and male employees.  Frye did not complain
personally to the company about Clark until company investigators
approached her after hearing rumors of the incidents.  She told
them she did not want Clark fired and would handle the situation
herself; she declined to provide a written statement and
resigned.

     The company continued its own investigation, reprimanding
Clark and requiring sexual harassment training for all
supervisors.  The decision to reprimand, rather than terminate,
was based on the fact that Clark denied the allegation; there
were no prior complaints against Clark; and Frye had asked that
Clark not be fired.  Frye was notified of the reprimand, but
refused several invitations to return to work at Virginia
Transformer.  Her request for post-traumatic stress workers'
compensation was denied, and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission issued a no-cause determination.

     Frye filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Virginia, alleging sexual harassment by Clark and
Virginia Transformer, assault and battery by Clark, and negligent
retention by Virginia Transformer.

     Chief Judge Jackson L. Kisor refused to dismiss the
Title VII claim against Clark but dismissed the negligent
retention cause of action against the company.

     First, Judge Kisor ruled an individual supervisor may be
liable under Title VII for sexual harassment conducted for the
supervisor's own benefit, not for the benefit of the employer.
In concluding that there are situations where a supervisor should
be held individually liable under Title VII, he differentiated
between an age discrimination suit where the discrimination is
"relatively benign" and a Title VII suit involving "more
egregious sexual harassment."  He also noted that Title VII's
"rationale of solicitude" for small businesses should be
inapplicable is cases such as this.  Therefore, Frye should be
given the opportunity to prove that Clark exercised the requisite
degree of supervisory control to warrant Title VII liability, he
said.

     Next, he let stand the Title VII claim against Virginia
Transformer, despite the company's arguments that (1) it was
unaware of Clark's misconduct; and (2) Clark harassed both male
and female employees, so his conduct was not "based on sex."
However, he dismissed the negligent retention claim, holding
that, although state law recognizes the tort of negligent hiring,
it does not recognize the tort of negligent retention:  "employer
liability in this analysis centers only on the decision to hire;
it goes no further once the employee is actually retained."

     Terry Neill Grimes of King, Fulghum, Snead, Nixon & Grimes
in Roanoke represented Frye.  Defense counsel were Clinton
Stephen Morse and Todd A. Leeson of Woods, Rogers & Hazlegrove in
Roanoke and Agnis Chandra Chakravorty of the Center for
Employment Law in Roanoke.

10TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS
SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR
K-MART IN HARASSMENT CASE

     An employee who claimed that K-Mart should be held liable
for her sexual harassment by a co-worker cannot avoid summary
judgment in favor of her employer because she failed to show that
the company knew about, but did nothing to remedy, the alleged
hostile workplace, the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has
held.  Ulrich v. K-Mart Corp., No. 94-3267 (10th Cir.).

     The panel affirmed the decision and reasoning of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas, noting that, although
the alleged harasser had the title of "manager," there was no
evidence that he used any supervisory authority to facilitate his
sexual harassment of the employee.

     Terry Ulrich worked in the layaway department at K-Mart.
She worked regularly on inventory checks with Larry Denney, who
held the title of "loss prevention manager."  In August 1991,
Ulrich reported to K-Mart's personnel manager a number of
incidents of sexual harassment by Denney, who allegedly grabbed
her breasts and other areas of her anatomy, and kissed her
against her will.

     K-Mart responded to the report by instructing Denney in
writing to stay away from Ulrich during investigation of the
incidents, all of which took place within one week during July
1991.  Denney was later fired.
               Ulrich filed one charge with the state human rights
commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and
later filed a second charge claiming that K-Mart retaliated
against her for the first charge.  Ulrich said that her
assignment after her return from a leave of absence was a
"demotion."  K-Mart countered that the temporary assignment about
which Ulrich complained was not a demotion, as Ulrich continued
to receive the same rate of pay and benefits as she had prior to
her leave of absence.

     The complaint alleged sexual harassment and constructive
discharge/retaliation under Title VII and the Kansas Acts Against
Discrimination, assault and battery, negligent retention,
invasion of privacy, breach of duty to provide a harassment-free
workplace, and failure to properly hire and train.

     U.S. District Judge Monti Belot entered summary judgment in
favor of K-Mart.  He found that, although Denney's conduct
constituted hostile environment sexual harassment, K-Mart could
not be held liable.

     First, K-Mart was not liable for the harassment because
(1) the "grabbing, hugging and fondling" were not within Denney's
job description; (2) the employee handbook expressly stated that
sexual harassment was prohibited; and (3) the handbook definition
of sexual harassment covered Denney's conduct.

     Second, the court rejected Ulrich's contention that K-Mart
had actual or constructive notice of Denney's harassment of other
employees because he had been involved in three adulterous
affairs with female co-workers.  Judge Belot said that, even if
K-Mart had known about the affairs, the evidence clearly
indicated that the relationships were consensual.  The sexual
advances must be unwelcome to trigger a duty on the employer to
act to prevent them, he stated.  In addition, the company acted
promptly to remedy the situation with Ulrich, observed the judge.

     Third, the company cannot be held liable for the harassment
because Denney did not purport to be acting as K-Mart's agent at
the time of the misconduct.  While Denney held the title of
"manager" with respect to the store's surveillance and security,
he did not hire or fire anyone, did not discipline anyone and did
not control other employees' schedules or their wages.  More
importantly, Ulrich does not claim that Denney used any
supervisory authority to press his sexual harassment of Ulrich,
said the court.

     Turning to Ulrich's constructive discharge/retaliation
claims, Judge Belot said that Ulrich had failed to show that the
temporary assignment she was given after her return from a leave
of absence made her working conditions so intolerable that she
was forced to quit.  The court said it was the fact that Ulrich's
pay and benefits remained the same and not her subjective view of
the "atmosphere or dignity" of her employment which determined
whether Ulrich had been constructively discharged.  "A reasonable
person in Ulrich's position would not view having to perform the
duties of door greeter and checker for limited periods of time as
intolerable," said the judge.

     Finally, Ulrich's negligent retention and failure to
properly hire and train were rejected by the district court.  K-
Mart's personnel director testified that, until Ulrich herself
reported Denney's misconduct in August 1991, the company had no
knowledge of the problem, said Judge Belot.

CALIFORNIA JUDGE CLEARS
LOS ANGELES COUNCILMAN OF
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES

     A California state court judge has rejected the claims of a
former secretary that her boss, a Los Angeles city councilman,
two of his employees and the city itself were responsible for
hostile environment and quid pro quo sexual harassment.  Beyda v.
City of Los Angeles et al., No. BC083850 (CA Super. Ct., Los
Angeles Cty.).

     In his Nov. 27 ruling, the judge stated that the
councilman's condominium, where some of the alleged harassment
took place, did not constitute a "workplace":  there was
insufficient evidence that the visits by the secretary were work-
related, or that the defendant had exerted "some kind of power"
over the plaintiff to get her to come to the apartment.

     According to Marlee Beyda's August 1993 complaint, she was
hired as Councilman Nate Holden's secretary in April 1991.
Shortly thereafter, she was allegedly subjected to sexual
harassment in the form of unwanted touching of her; forced
touching of Holden; forcible removal of her clothing; requests
for unwelcome sexual interaction as a condition of continued
employment; and sexually explicit conversations in her presence.
The harassment took place not only in the "sexually charged"
atmosphere of the office, but also in Holden's condominium, where
Holden tried to convince Beyda that she "owed" him sexual
activity after all he had done for her, she claimed.

     Beyda claimed that two of Holden's employees either joined
in the verbal harassment or cooperated in Holden's misconduct in
an attempt to get her " the only white female and/or Jewish
employee in Holden's office " to quit.  Beyda also said that
African-American males were given preference with respect to work
hours, assignments, trips out of the city and application of
office policies.  The harassment and the preferential treatment
of men constituted unlawful discrimination on the basis of
gender, race, ethnicity and religion, and forced her to quit her
job, she claimed.  She requested $1 million in damages on her
claims of discrimination, wrongful termination, breach of
contract, negligent supervision, assault, battery and invasion of
privacy.

     In her trial brief, Beyda argued not only that she was the
target of sexual harassment, but also that she was subjected to
harassment by having to witness the harassment of other female
co-workers.  Hostile environment can be found when a "supervisor
obtains sexual favors from subordinates other than the
complainant," she contended.  She urged the court to hold the
defendants liable for knowledge of Holden's harassment even
though she did not report each and every incident of misconduct.

     In their post-trial brief, the three individual defendants
argued that Beyda failed to meet her burden of showing that the
harassing conduct "altered her working conditions and created an
abusive working environment."  Beyda's working environment did
not extend to Holden's private residence, as she herself admitted
that she was not asked to work at the apartment and did not work
there, they argued.  In addition, Beyda could not support her
contention that she was, as were deputies, on call 24 hours per
day, and, therefore, that she was "working" at Holden's apartment
whenever she went there after normal office hours.

     Second, there was no evidence that Holden had the authority,
or misused that authority, to coerce Beyda to come to his home,
said the defendants.  However, even if the apartment were
considered an extension of the work environment, there was no
evidence that any sexual harassment occurred there.  For example,
Beyda never complained to anyone in authority about Holden's
treatment of her; she visited the apartment even after she
resigned; and her demeanor and performance at work did not
display any of the depression or other emotional distress of
which she complained, said the defendants.

     Third, Beyda did not establish the elements of a qui pro quo
harassment claim, argued the defendants.  Her attendance of work-
related events was not curtailed in any way, and she did not
demonstrate that Holden conditioned her "putting out" or having
sex of any kind on raises, promotions, pay, demotion, termination
or any other adverse job consequence.

     Beyda was represented by Dan Stormer of Hadsel & Stormer in
Pasadena and by J.L. O'Donnell of O'Donnell & Mandrell in Los
Angeles.  Counsel for the individual defendants were Louis Miller
and Michael O'Connor of Christensen, White, Miller, Fink, Jacobs,
Glaser & Shapiro in Los Angeles.

LEGAL SECRETARY CLAIMS
FORMER LAW FIRM LIABLE
FOR HARASSMENT, DEFAMATION

     A legal secretary has filed suit in California state court
against her former employer, alleging that she was sexually
harassed by one of the firm's partners, and that the rest of the
firm conspired to cover up the misconduct and force her out of
her job when she complained.  Van Sloten v. Chase, Rotchford,
Drukker & Bogust et al., No. BC139859 (CA Super. Ct., Los Angeles
Cty.).

     The complaint also contains claims for sexual battery,
defamation, negligence, breach of oral contract and wrongful
termination.

     Plaintiff Martha Van Sloten began working for the firm of
Chase, Rotchford, Drukker & Bogust in 1977 and, in 1978, was
assigned to work for firm partner Howard Slavin as his personal
secretary.  She says that Slavin made "offensive and off-color
sexual remarks" to her, including several requests for sexual
intercourse and descriptions of his sexual fantasies; touched her
in a sexual manner; and finally raped her in December 1992 and
December 1993.

     The rest of the firm knew about the incidents of sexual
harassment by Slavin, but took no action to remedy the situation,
claims Van Sloten.  This failure to stop the harassment amounted
to an "authorization and ratification" of Slavin's misconduct by
the officers and directors, says the complaint.  In addition, the
firm and Slavin conspired to increase the harassment in an
attempt to damage her health and force her to quit, says Van
Sloten.  Allowing Slavin to occupy "positions of trust and
authority at a time when they knew or should have known about his
improper conduct" amounted to negligence on the part of the firm,
she says.

     The basis of the defamation claim are false statements
allegedly made by the firm concerning Van Sloten's "inadequate"
job performance, again in an attempt to force her out of her job.
The defendants also breached their oral contract with Van Sloten
by failing to ensure that she worked in an environment free of
sexual harassment, says the complaint.  According to the
complaint, Van Sloten was terminated in violation of public
policy because her 16-year career with Chase Rotchford gave her
"the present ability to testify to facts which implicated
defendants Chase Rotchford and Slavin in acts which violated the
provisions of the state bar act...."

     Van Sloten has requested the award of double her lost
earnings as well as unspecified general damages for mental
distress, punitive and exemplary damages, an injunction against
the firm, an order that mandates sensitivity training and
publicly posted statements at the firm to inform employees that
sexual harassment violates state and federal law.

     The complaint was filed by David Smith Bates of Beverly
Hills.

8TH CIRCUIT THROWS OUT
$500,000 PUNITIVE AWARD IN
CREDIT CARD SNOOPING SUIT

     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 19 reversed
a punitive damage award of $500,000 to a former Amoco Oil Co.
employee who claimed that he was fired because of his age, and
that Amoco invaded his privacy by inspecting his credit card
records for days when he had called in sick.  Pulla v. Amoco Oil
Co., Nos. 94-4001 and 95-1047 (8th Cir.).

     The court concluded that, given the "limited offensiveness"
of Amoco's actions and the "unlikelihood of any serious potential
harm" from its conduct, the 250,000-to-1 ratio of punitive
damages to actual damages was "excessive, unreasonable and
violative of due process."

     The dispute began when Thaddeus Pulla, a 15-year Amoco
employee, was told that performance in the company's credit card
department was unsatisfactory.  He was demoted in July 1989, and
replaced by a 45-year-old female.  Pulla, who was 48, filed suit
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), supporting
his claim with several ageist comments by his supervisor.

     Pulla later amended his complaint to allege that Amoco had
retaliated against him for the ADEA filing and had also violated
state tort law by invading his privacy.  The basis of the
invasion of privacy claim was the company's inspection of his
credit card records after one of Pulla's co-workers decided that
she was tired of covering Pulla's shift when he called in sick.
Pulla had missed two months of work in 1991.  The co-worker
discovered that Pulla had used his credit card at a number of
restaurants and bars on the days when he had called in sick, and
reported these findings to their mutual supervisor.

     The co-worker was admonished but not disciplined for
reviewing the credit card records, and Amoco subsequently
retrieved the information and made it a part of Pulla's personnel
records.  Finally, the supervisor referred to Pulla's absence
problem in his next evaluation, and singled him out for the
unique requirement of having to obtain a physician's note before
submitting any claims for sick leave.

     The jury found in favor of Amoco on the age discrimination
claims, but found in favor of Pulla on the invasion of privacy
claim.  The award was $1 for actual damages for past pain and
suffering and $1 actual damages for future pain and suffering.
However, the jury concluded that the company had acted "willfully
and wantonly" in violating Pulla's right to privacy and awarded
him $500,000 in punitive damages.

     The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa
rebuffed Amoco's motion for j.n.o.v., a new trial and remittitur.

     The appeals court panel, in an opinion by the Honorable
Byron White, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, sitting
by designation, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

     First, Justice White found no error in the district court's
conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to support the
jury's finding on the invasion of privacy claim.  Therefore, he
said, there was no abuse of discretion in denying in its entirety
Amoco's motion for a new trial.

     Next, there was no error in the district court's conclusion
that Pulla failed to present sufficient evidence to support his
breach of contract claim, i.e., that Amoco's employment policies
constituted an exception to Iowa's employment-at-will doctrine.
The evidence included:  (1) a progressive discipline policy which
managers "should follow"; (2) a merit employment policy that
managers "should follow"; (3) statements by Amoco that it will
"follow the law and maintain equal opportunity in employment";
and (4) statements that the workplace should be "friendly and
cooperative."  These were not sufficiently definite or mandatory
to constitute a binding contract, said the appeals court panel.

     Finally, Justice White addressed the issue of the
constitutionality of the punitive damages award, stating that the
U.S. Supreme Court has twice stated that the appropriate
framework to employ is a "general concern for reasonableness."
This concern "requires that the award be 'rational in light of
its purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter its
repetition,'" he stated.

     Based on this framework, the $500,000 punitive damages award
was unreasonable and violated Amoco's substantive due process
rights, said the panel.  The district court erred by
misperceiving the nature of the potential harm, said Justice
White.  Because Pulla did not present any evidence that the
company put any other individual's privacy at risk, the potential
harm from the search of his credit card records can be analyzed
only in terms of the very limited way it affected him.  The
appeals court contrasted Pulla's situation with one where a
manufacturer puts several thousand potentially dangerous products
" such as breast implants " into the marketplace.

     In addition, Amoco's conduct was not as offensive as
perceived by the district court because there was no indication
that the supervisor's conduct in retrieving Pulla's credit card
records reflected a company policy or practice.  There was no
evidence that this was anything more than an "isolated and rare"
incident, said Justice White.

DE COURT ENTERS
PARTIAL DISMISSAL OF
CLAIMS AGAINST DUPONT

     U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson has ruled that a group of
DuPont employees may proceed with some of their Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Americans With
Disabilities Act (ADA), and Employee Retirement and Income
Security Act (ERISA) claims against their former employer, E.I.
DuPont de Nemours & Co.  Adkins et al. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours
& Co. et al., No. 95-315-SLR (D DE); see Employment LR, July 11,
1995.

     Ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA and
pendent state law claims, Judge Robinson allowed the ERISA
wrongful discharge claims to remain, but dismissed those ERISA
claims which relied on allegations of fraud with respect to the
severance plan.  The state law claims were also dismissed.

     Court documents contained the following background
information:  A group of 180 DuPont employees filed a 12-count
purported class action suit against the company, alleging that
DuPont tried to force out older employees by instituting a cross-
training program and by reducing the workforce by almost half to
avoid paying full pension benefits.

     The complaint states that shortly after the company
instituted a High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) program, the
workers were threatened with termination if they did not comply
with its requirement that each employee learn how to perform each
job at the plant.  The employees also claim that older employees
were intimidated into leaving their jobs and accepting a
reduction in pension benefits.

     The employees also allege that the company refused to
accommodate the vision or physical impairments which those older
employees had, and instead intentionally placed them in jobs
which they were not able to perform.  The company violated the
ADA, says the workers, by creating only four ADA "slots," light
duty positions which were filled on the basis of seniority rather
than need.

     At the time that the HPWS program began, an enhanced
severance benefits program was also announced.  In contrast to
the DuPont early retirement plan, which provided for 100% of
pension benefits even though an employee may not have attained
the age or years of service generally needed for full retirement
benefits, the severance plan paid less than 100% of the pension
benefits, said the workers.  By coercing the older employees to
enter the severance program, DuPont was able to substantially
reduce its pension benefits obligations, says the complaint.

     In addition to alleging violations of the ADEA, ADA and
ERISA, the complaint alleged negligent misrepresentation, breach
of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, fraud and promissory
estoppel.

     Judge Robinson first ruled on the employees' ERISA claims,
holding that those portions of the claims charging DuPont with
having made false statements and misrepresentations regarding the
severance plan "relate to" an ERISA plan, and, therefore, are
preempted under 29 U.S.C. Section 1144(a).   However, while the
judge dismissed so much of those claims which allege fraud and
constructive fraud, she refused to dismiss the remainder of the
ERISA claims.

     Next, the court addressed the employees' contention that
DuPont breached its fiduciary duty with respect to its handling
of the severance and pension plans.  Judge Robinson dismissed
this claim because the plaintiffs were seeking only monetary
relief for an alleged breach of duty under ERISA.

     Third, the court allowed the claims of fraud and
constructive fraud to remain, provided that the employees amend
them to meet the requirements of FRCP 9(b).  The defendants
argued, and Judge Robinson agreed, that those claims were not
pleaded with sufficient particularity, and failed to show the
"nature and scope" of efforts to obtain the information needed to
plead with particularity.  The employees contended that details
were not available because "defendants are in a much better
position to know the details of the fraudulent conduct" and they
were not about to provide such information.

     Finally, Judge Robinson rejected the defendants' statute of
limitations argument with respect dismissal of the ERISA wrongful
termination claims.  She said that, although the one-year
Virginia limitations period applies to this claim, the
limitations period could be equitably tolled based on the
allegations of fraud in the complaint.

     The employees are represented by Robert Jacobs and Douglas
Canfield of Jacobs & Crumpler in Wilmington; by J. David Flowers
and James Rion of Ness Motley Loadholt Richardson & Poole in
Greensville, SC; by Gary Kendall and Denise Linsford of Michie
Hamlett Lowry Rasmussen & Tweel in Charlottesville, VA; and by
Kenneth Henley of Michie Hamlett's Bala Cynwyd, PA, office.

     Counsel for the defendants are Dupont corporate attorneys
Richard Paul and Catherine Thompson and Hill Wellford, Particia
Epps and Wood Lay of Hunton & Williams in Richmond.

6TH CIR. SEES NO ERROR
IN DENIAL OF DOCTOR'S
DISCRIMINATION CLAIM

     A unanimous panel of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
has found no basis to overturn a federal jury's verdict that a
Michigan cardiologist was not discriminated against on the basis
of his age or Mexican heritage.  Muzquiz v. W.A. Foote Memorial
Hospital, Nos. 94-1088, 94-1089 and 94-1420 (6th Cir.).

     The panel held that the dismissal of the doctor's antitrust,
breach of contract and other claims was based on a lack of
evidence or compelled by legal precedent.

     Moses Muzquiz is a medical doctor of Hispanic descent who
practiced cardiology in Texas and Mexico for many years prior to
establishing a practice in Michigan in 1985.  He became a member
of the provisional staff of W.A. Foote Memorial Hospital in 1989.
When Foote established a cardiac catheterization laboratory in
1991, Muzquiz applied for invasive cardiology privileges.
Muzquiz was the oldest member of Foote's staff to apply.

     The review of his credentials ran into some difficulty as
Muzquiz had performed cardiac catheterizations only in Mexico.
As a result, Foote's Credentials Committee had to rely on
translated patient charts obtained from a Mexican hospital.  The
requested films of catheterizations and the original charts were
not available.  The Credentials Committee recommended that
Muzquiz be granted provisional cardiac catheterization privileges
based on favorable evaluations of his first 10 cardiac
procedures.

     However, Foote's Medical Executive Committee rejected that
recommendation, opining that Muzquiz's time away from
catheterization procedures required that his first 25 procedures
be proctored.  Foote's Board of Trustees adopted the Medical
Executive Committee's recommendation on Jan. 22, 1992.

     Muzquiz subsequently objected to the 25-procedure
requirement, as well as to Foote's selection of proctors for his
procedures.  Muzquiz viewed the physicians selected by Foote as
direct competitors.  On March 17, 1992, Muzquiz formally rejected
the conditions placed on his provisional catheterization
privileges.  On March 25, 1992, Foote's Board of Trustees
withdrew the provisional grant of privileges to Muzquiz.

     Muzquiz filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan on Sept. 21, 1992, alleging violations of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Elliot-Larsen
Civil Rights Act.  Muzquiz's suit also advanced antitrust and
breach of contract claims that were dismissed by the district
court.  After two days of deliberation, a jury found that Muzquiz
had not been discriminated against on the basis of his age or
national origin, although it said that "[w]e would hope that
Foote Hospital and Muzquiz would go forward speedily to honor his
residence requirement of ten cases."

     Foote's post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees under the
Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) was denied by the
district court on March 24, 1994.

     Muzquiz appealed the district court's judgment.  Foote filed
a cross-appeal, as well as an appeal of the district court's
denial of attorneys' fees.

               The Sixth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed both the
verdict against Muzquiz and the denial of attorneys' fees.

     The panel said that the district court did not err in
refusing to allow Muzquiz to question witnesses in an attempt to
prove that Foote's credentialling process, while facially
neutral, had a disparate impact on protected groups under
Title VII.  The panel said that, at most, that line of
questioning would show bias against Muzquiz's medical training in
Mexico, but not bias against people of Mexican heritage.  The
panel also refused to assign error to the district court's
refusal to allow other testimony on the discrimination claim.
The panel said that this testimony either did not indicate a bias
based on Muzquiz's heritage or was "simply not probative of
discriminatory animus."

     Muzquiz's assertion that the district court erred in
dismissing his antitrust and breach of contract claims was also
rejected by the panel.  The panel followed the teaching in Nurse
Midwifery Assn. v. Hibbert, 918 F.2d 605 (6th Cir. 1990), that
"the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine prevents a finding of
conspiracy between a hospital and its medical staff...."  Absent
a conspiracy, there was no violation of Section 1 of the Sherman
Act, said the panel.  As to the breach of contract claim, the
panel agreed with the district court that judicial review of
staffing decisions by private hospitals is precluded by Sarin v.
Samaritan Health Center, 440 N.W.2d 80 (MI App. 1989).

     The panel also rejected Muzquiz's argument that the district
court placed undue limitations on pretrial discovery, noting that
the district court's "dismissal of [Muzquiz's] claims was based
on legal determinations that could not have been altered by any
further discovery."  In any event, the panel noted that Muzquiz
had never filed a motion to compel discovery.

     Finally, the panel said, "we conclude that Dr. Muzquiz's
claims were not without foundation so as to entitle [Foote] to an
award of attorney fees and costs under HCQIA."  The panel opined
that "Dr. Muzquiz had a legitimate factual basis for alleging
that the extreme delay in his application processing was the
result of a bias...."  Furthermore, the panel said that "[t]he
fact that several of his claims either lacked sufficient evidence
to go forward, or were determined to be precluded by legal
precedent in this circuit or under Michigan law, does not mean
that those claims were completely without foundation."

9TH CIRCUIT FINDS
EMPLOYER EAVESDROPPING
UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE

     An employer who conducts private surveillance on employees
and eavesdrops on the conversations of those it suspects are
involved in union-related activities has violated the Labor
Management Relations Act's (LMRA) prohibition against unfair
labor practices, said the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Dec. 1.  National Labor Relations Board v. Unbelievable, Inc.,
No. 93-70236 (9th Cir.).

     The panel ordered enforcement of the NLRB order on a finding
that the employer had wrongfully ejected union representatives
based on what was overheard and also violated the LMRA when it
unilaterally established new disciplinary rules with respect to
suspected drug users and refused to make pension contributions.

     Employer Unbelievable, Inc. does business as Frontier Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas.  In February 1990, collective bargaining
between Frontier and the several unions which represent the
culinary workers, bartenders and restaurant employees who work
for Frontier broke down.  After the collective bargaining
agreement (CBA) expired, Frontier began to eavesdrop on employee
conversations and to eject union representatives for "harassing"
other employees.  The administrative law judge found that, while
ejection of union representatives is proper under some
circumstances, the several incidents cited by the union were
"unremarkable" and not a proper basis for ejection.

     As to the promulgation of new disciplinary rules, Frontier
argued that five of the new rules did not involve changes which
were "material, substantial or significant."  The ALJ and the
appeals court panel disagreed, citing in particular a new rule
which required employees suspected of being under the influence
of drugs or alcohol to undergo a medical examination or be
terminated immediately.  The old rules said nothing about an
examination, noted the panel, and this change could hardly be
considered "insubstantial."

     As to the pension contributions, the panel noted that,
during the negotiations over a new agreement, the provisions for
pension fund contributions were never at issue.  The court
rejected Frontier's contention that under the LMRA there must be
a written agreement with the employer before contributions to an
employee trust fund can be made. An employer has a duty to
refrain from unilaterally changing the terms of employment
without first bargaining, said the court.

     Here, Frontier was legally obligated to continue its
contributions to the pension fund after the expiration of the
CBA, and was in violation of the law when it did not give the
union prior notice or opportunity to bargain, said the panel.
Frontier also failed to present any evidence that changes in the
pension plan were reasonably comprehended in its proposals before
negotiations reached an impasse.  There had been no waiver by the
union of its right to bargain over the proposed pension plan
change, it added.

     The panel imposed sanctions against Frontier in the form of
attorneys' fees and double costs, as the company's appeal was
"frivolous," concluded the court.

     The NLRB was represented by NLRB attorney Frederick Havard
in Washington, DC.  Counsel for the union was Barry Jellison and
Michael Anderson of Cowell & Bowe in San Francisco.  James Meyers
of Meyers, Schultz & Wolds in San Francisco and Michael Taylor of
Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart in Washington, DC,
represented Unbelievable.

FL CITY ARGUES THAT
TOBACCO-USE HIRING
POLICY IS REASONABLE

     The U.S. Constitution does not forbid governments, when
making employment decisions, from taking into account the real
and substantial additional costs of employing tobacco users, the
City of North Miami argued in a response brief filed Dec. 4 with
the U.S. Supreme Court.  Kurtz v. City of North Miami, No. 95-545
(U.S.); see Employment LR, Nov. 28, 1995.

     The argument was made in a brief in response to a petition
from Arlene Kurtz for a writ of certiorari to a Florida Supreme
Court ruling that a regulation requiring a job applicant not to
have used tobacco for at least one year before applying for work
with the City of North Miami is not an intrusion of privacy
rights.

     The Florida Supreme Court held that Kurtz had no reasonable
expectation of privacy when she applied for a position with the
city and that the city, saying that it enacted the requirement to
reduce costs and bolster productivity, had established a
compelling interest.

     The city said that the only issue before the Florida Supreme
Court was a state law certified question of whether the Florida
constitution barred the city's employment policy.  Because the
only issue presented to the Florida Supreme Court was the state
law issue decided and certified by the state district court, the
Supreme Court should deny Kurtz's petition for certiorari, the
city said.

     Further, the city said, the state Supreme Court did not
"decide," as Kurtz asserted, a question of federal constitutional
law, and no question of due process.  Therefore, the issue is not
one that warrants Supreme Court review.

     Also, Kurtz's portrayal of the factual and procedural
predicates of the case were "profoundly inaccurate," the city
said, adding that it proved through undisputed evidence that the
policy was legitimate and rational, "while Kurtz proved nothing
at all."

     The city's response was submitted by Thomas M. Pflaum of
Micanopy, FL, and by Pedro P. Echarte Jr. of Miami.

CA CT. GRANTS JUDGMENT
FOR DEFENSE IN OFFICE
EMF EXPOSURE CASE

     Holding that the plaintiffs would be unable to submit causal
evidence associating electromagnetic field exposure to the
development of cancer in humans, a California Superior Court
judge on Dec. 8 granted defendant Southern California Edison's
(SCE) motion for summary judgment in a suit by office workers who
say they developed cancer due to the location of an SCE
transformer beneath their office.  Johsz et al. v. Koll Co. et
al., No. 726765 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.); see Employment LR,
Sept. 27, 1994.

     Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Warren Siegel said he
agreed with SCE's assertion that plaintiffs' proffered testimony
would not meet the Kelly-Frye admissibility test.  Such
testimony, which was to have been given at trial beginning on
Jan. 8, he said, failed to conclusively say EMF caused
plaintiffs' cancers.  The testimony expected from plaintiffs
experts Samuel Milham, M.D., M.P.H., and David Michael Ozonoff,
M.D., suggested only that "there is a causal association; that
based on statistics it 'may' be a cause," the judge ruled.

     The judge added, "Statistics may lend credence to an opinion
that EMF caused plaintiff's cancers, but there is no expert
opinion that it did in these cases and Ozonoff and Milham are the
only causation experts proposed by the plaintiffs on the EMF
issue."

     Co-defendants Koll Co. and Grubb & Ellis joined in the
utility's summary judgment motion.

     Plaintiffs Michael and Jill Johsz, James and Christianne
Nichols, and Mary Ann Stewart voluntarily dismissed with
prejudice their causes of action for battery and fraudulent
concealment and their request for punitive damages after SCE
moved for summary judgment on Nov. 7.  Plaintiff attorney Annee
Della Donna, who plans to file a motion for a new trial by early
January, says the ruling does not affect companion cases Younkin
v. Southern California Edison, in which a March settlement
conference is slated, or Muir v. Southern California Edison,
which is scheduled for trial on May 20, 1996.

     The plaintiffs discounted SCE's summary judgment motion
claim that the Kelly-Frye test is inapplicable, arguing that it
applies only to admissibility of "new scientific methods, devices
or techniques" in criminal cases.  They instead said that their
conclusions and opinions should be judged, and are shown
reliable, under the 35-year-old "Hill Criteria," developed in
England.  The Hill Criteria, they argued, include strength,
consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, coherence, experiment and analogy.

     "Plaintiffs argue that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicable
to the scientific principle of whether EMF causes cancer, but
rather is limited to novel scientific techniques, methods or
tests," SCE responded.  "In support of this argument, plaintiffs
cite several California decisions which have held that the Kelly-
Frye rule is not applicable to medical opinion testimony based on
an examination of a particular physical or psychological injury."

     The utility continues, "[H]owever, the cases cited by
plaintiffs on this point are inapposite in that the issue with
respect to Edison's motion for summary judgment is not the
admissibility of medical opinion testimony that EMF caused
plaintiffs' specific cancers, but rather the admissibility of
scientific evidence on the threshold issue of whether EMF causes
cancer generally.  This distinction is highlighted by the fact
that the expert declarations submitted to plaintiffs in
opposition to Edison's motion for summary judgment do not
indicate that either of the declarants have ever examined any of
the plaintiffs in this action, but rather base their opinions
solely upon scientific literature and epidemiologic studies
regarding the health effects of EMF."

     Opposing SCE's motion, the plaintiffs challenged the
qualifications of defense experts Philip Cole, M.D., Chairman of
the University of Alabama School of Public Health's Department of
Epidemiology, and Jack D. Sahl, M.S., M.P.H., Ph.D, an SCE
research scientist since 1983.  Both men, the plaintiffs argued,
"are so tied to the utility companies that their testimony is not
credible."

     The plaintiffs added, "These 'utility experts' are too
closely identified with the utility view to access fairly and
impartially the nature and extent of any opposing scientific
views....  Before 1992, neither Sahl or Cole conducted any
epidemiological research themselves.  Sahl published a study on
behalf of his employer, SCE, and expectedly reached a negative
result.  Cole's only epidemiological study was conducted in the
past year, even though both have held themselves out to the
public as epidemiologists for years."

     SCE replied, "In contrast to the declaration of Dr. Cole
[that there is no causal relationship between human cancer
development and EMF exposure], the declarations submitted by
plaintiffs are devoid of any reference to general acceptance
within the scientific community of the principle that EMF causes
cancer.  Rather than addressing the consensus of the scientific
community, Dr. Milham simply states that there are a number of
biological mechanisms by which EMF 'may' cause cancer, that EMF
'may' effect and compromise the immune system, and that, in his
opinion, EMF exposure promotes a number of cancers."

               The plaintiffs are represented by Della Donna and Wylie A.
Aitken of the Law Offices of Wylie A. Aitken in Santa Ana, CA.
SCE is represented by Duncan Barr and Joel C. Lamp of O'Connor,
Cohn, Dillon & Barr in San Francisco; Frank C. Rothrock and

CHLORINE PLANT WORKER
FAILS TO SHOW CO-WORKERS
WILLFULLY ENDANGERED HER

     A provision of the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act allows
an employee to bring a tort action against other employees for
injuries caused by willful misconduct, but a plaintiff who
alleged that her co-workers poisoned her by removing certain
safety devices from an area where she was exposed to mercury
fumes was unable to prove the necessary element of willfulness,
the Alabama Supreme Court has ruled.  Namislo v. Akzo Chemical
Co., No. CV-92-1127 (AL Sup. Ct.).

     Mary Namislo was employed in a chlorine manufacturing plant
was that was owned in succession by Stauffer Chemical Co.,
Chesebrough-Ponds and Akzo Chemical Co.  In 1992, she and her
husband, Ricky, sued Akzo on behalf of themselves and their
daughter, Amber, alleging that both she and Amber had suffered
mercury poisoning and that Ricky had suffered loss of consortium.
The suit named Akzo, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. and
several of Mary Namislo's co-workers.

     The complaint alleged that Akzo and the co-workers had
negligently and wantonly caused the mercury poisoning and had
negligently failed to warn that mercury created a dangerous
condition at the plant.  The suit also alleged fraud, outrage and
willful conduct.

     When the trial court dismissed all of the claims against
Akzo and the co-workers, the Namislos appealed to the Supreme
Court, which reversed and remanded on the grounds that the
Workers' Compensation Act does not exclude Akzo's liability to
nonemployees such as Amber.  The court ruled further that the act
does not bar Amber's claims against the co-workers on fraud,
outrage and willfulness nor does it bar the Namislos' claims
against the co-workers for Amber's medical expenses and the loss
of her services.

     On remand, the trial court again granted summary judgment
dismissing claims against Stauffer and Chesebrough-Ponds for
negligence and wantonness, against the co-workers for willful
conduct and outrage, and against all the defendants for
intentional fraud and intentional suppression of material facts.
               On this second appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial
court's judgment on all claims.  Namislo contended that the trial
court erred in dismissing the willful conduct claims because it
had incorrectly held that those claims were barred by the
Workers' Compensation Act's exclusivity provisions.

      Under the provisions of Section 25-5-11(b), the
occupational disease provision, an action against third parties
or co-employees is not a claim for workmen's compensation but is
a tort action for damages that is removed from the exclusive
remedy provisions of the act, the appellate court ruled.  That
section specifies that "if personal injury or death of an
employee results from the willful conduct, ...of any...employee
of the same employer...the employee shall have a cause of action
against the person...."

     The issue here was whether Namislo had offered substantial
evidence of willful conduct, and the Supreme Court found that she
did not.  She contended that the willful conduct was the removal
of safety devices from machines that otherwise would have
protected her from exposure to mercury.

     She alleged that her co-workers failed to maintain exhaust
fans and a scrubber in the "cell house," a structure in the plant
where the chlorine gas is produced, which she was required to
clean.  She also claimed that her co-employees provided the wrong
filters for a respirator that she used while performing the
cleaning.

     The Supreme Court ruled that the scrubber and exhaust fans
were not safety devices within the meaning of the Workers'
Compensation Act because they are part of the system to produce
chlorine gas, not to provide safety to workers.  In addition, the
court said, while co-employees may be held liable for the removal
or omission of a manufacturer's safety device from a machine "
such as the respirator Namislo used " nothing was removed or
omitted from the respirator and, therefore, it does not fall
within the purview of the act.

     The appellate court also affirmed the trial court's judgment
with regard to the remaining claims, finding no evidence "that
the defendants' actions in handling [Namislo's] claim were 'so
outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond
all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious
and utterly intolerable in a civilized society.'"  It quoted
American Road Service Co. v. Inmon, 394, So.2d [361] at 365 (AL
1980), and Nabors v. St. Paul Insurance Co., 489 So.2d 573 (AL
1986).

     Namislo was represented by Christopher E. Peters of Cherry,
Givens, Peters, Lockett & Diaz in Mobile, AL.  Akzo was
represented by Carroll H. Sullivan of Clark, Scott & Sullivan,
also in Mobile.

EMPLOYEE CANNOT BRING
PRODUCT LIABILITY CASE
AGAINST IBM, SAYS ND IL

     Judge Blanche M. Manning of the Northern District of
Illinois recently dismissed a repetitive stress injury suit
against International Business Machines Corp. on the basis that
the plaintiff, a former IBM employee, was statutorily barred from
pursuing a product liability action against her former employer.
McCall v. IBM Corp., No. 95-581 (ND IL).

     In dismissing the suit, Judge Manning found controlling the
decision in Toth v. Westinghouse Elevator Co., 114 Ill.App.3d
905, 449 N.E.2d 1005 (1983).  "That case holds that an employer
in Illinois who is also the manufacturer of a product used in the
course of employment is not liable in damages to his own employee
in a products liability suit," said Judge Manning.

     Judge Manning also cited the Illinois Workers' Compensation
Act.  That statute says, at 820 ILCS 305/5(a):

     No common law or statutory right to recover damages from the
     employer...for injury or death sustained by any employee
     while engaged in the line of his duty as such employee,
     other than the compensation herein provided, is available to
     any employee....

     Judge Manning rejected the plaintiff's assertion that her
case fell within the "dual capacity" exception to the exclusive
remedy provision laid out in Sharp v. Gallagher Tractor Co., 85
Ill.2d 322, 227 N.E.2d 786 (1983), and others.  "That doctrine
does not apply unless the manufacturer is a separate legal entity
from the employer, said the judge.  "There is no evidence that
IBM, as manufacturer, has a separate legal identity from that as
plaintiff's employer," she added.

     Emma McCall brought an action against IBM on Dec. 30, 1994,
in Cook County Circuit Court, alleging that she suffered
repetitive stress injuries from using an IBM keyboard while in
IBM's employ from 1989 until early 1993.  The matter was removed
to federal district court on Jan. 30, 1995.

     IBM moved to dismiss McCall's complaint, citing the
exclusive remedy provision of the Illinois Workers' Compensation
Act.  IBM asserted that under the Act, McCall could not bring a
product liability suit against her employer.

     In defending her action from dismissal, McCall cited, in
addition to IBM's role as her employer, IBM's "entirely separate
and distinct second role as a designer, manufacturer and seller
of computer keyboards."

     "The duties, responsibilities, and obligations of IBM
imposed by the tenets of product liability law generate
obligations upon IBM wholly unrelated and distinct from its role
as an employer," added McCall.

ELECTRONIC SUPERVISION: A NEW TECHNOLOGY RESULTING
IN NEW JOB TENSIONS

The capabilities of new computer and communication
technologies for monitoring employees' activities in
the workplace are presented.  Although useful for
managers to control resources, plan workloads, and
reduce costs, this technology results in added
tension and stress for employees, and raises
questions about fairness, privacy, and quality of
work life.  It's all discussed in this (Office of
Technology Assessment) report.

MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 mandate the
establishment of an identifiable office to provide
technical and other non-financial assistance to
small manufacturers of medical devices, to assist
them in complying with the requirements of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  The Division
of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) was
established to meet these requirements and to
sponsor workshops and conferences to provide small
firms with firsthand working knowledge of device
requirements and compliance policies.

This (FDA) manual covers the range of basic
regulatory requirements that all manufacturers must
consider when they begin marketing a medical device.
The publication is useful as a reference for
establishment registration, device listing, labeling
requirements, classification, premarket notification
(510k), premarket approval, and other topics of
significance to device manufacturers.

FEDERAL TRAINING FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO HIGHWAY AND
RAILROAD HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENTS

"First responders" are state and local government
personnel who are the first on the scene of a
highway or railroad accident involving hazardous
materials.  Five federal agencies engage in
first-responder training:

 - the Federal Emergency Management Agency;

 - the EPA;

 - the Department of Transportation;

 - the DOE; and

 - the Department of Health and Human Services.

Overviews of each of these federal programs and
their responsibilities, budgets, and results, are
contained in this (General Accounting Office)
report.

SAFETY WITH INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS

Factors which may contribute to the dangerous
misjudgements people can make when they work near
industrial robots are examined (by the University of
West Virginia).  Entrapment may be possible, even by
slow-moving robots, particularly for individuals who
work on programming and troubleshooting.  In 27 of
36 robot-related injuries in Sweden, the injured
person was involved in adjustment, repair, or
programming tasks having moving object hazards.  In
another study of 170 accidents, the following
3 motion control problems accounted for 145 of the
cases:

 (1) Sudden unprogrammed startup.

 (2) Robot or associated machines had not been
     stopped.

 (3) Uncontrolled movement.

CUMULATIVE TRAUMA DISORDER MANUAL

Cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) in the workplace
are defined and discussed (by NIOSH), in order to
permit nonmedical personnel to recognize their
occurrence.  Cumulative trauma resulting in
musculoskeletal disorders are defined and common
types of CTDs are described along with examples of
jobs in which CTDs may occur.  Methods are presented
for determining how many workers at a particular
site have CTDs or early symptoms of the disorders.
Information is provided for conducting an
ergonometric job analysis, and two strategies are
discussed for preventing CTDs from occurring:

 (1) Instituting personnel-focused practices.

 (2) Redesigning tools, workstations, and jobs.

Appendices present additional information, such as:

 - a glossary of terms;

 - a series of illustrations defining body positions
    and movements;

 - an introduction to the diagnostic processes used
    by the medical profession to identify CTDs;

 - a summary of medical procedures to treat CTDs;

 - common epidemiological terms and statistical
    procedures for evaluating the prevalence and
    severity of CTDs;

 - a series of case histories to illustrate the
    frequency and costs associated with CTDs among

BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS

Electric and magnetic fields produced by electric
power systems have recently been added to the list
of environmental agents that are a potential threat
to public health.

This (Carnegie-Mellon University) report describes
exposures to fields from power systems and other
sources, reviews existing scientific evidence on the
biological effects of these fields, presents a
history of research support and regulatory
activities, and discusses problems and alternatives
to regulatory action.

If exposure to fields turns out to pose a health
risk, it is unlikely that high voltage transmission
lines will be the only sources of concern.
Power-frequency fields are also produced by distribution
lines, wall wiring, appliances, and lighting
fixtures.  These non-transmission sources are much
more common than transmission lines, and could play
a far greater role than transmission lines in any
public health problem.

End Of An Era
SOFTWARE WARS ARE OVER

Supreme Court's tie vote in Borland
moves debate over software to other arenas

The Supreme Court brought to a close, earlier this month, a
decade-long search in court for the proper and best way to
protect software.  The 4-4 tie in the Lotus v.  Borland case
will likely encourage parties to look to other forums,
particularly legislative bodies, for guidance and relief.

Most lawyers interviewed for this story say that there aren't
many cases percolating down below that are likely bait for
Supreme Court justices to nibble on.  "The age of the big cases
is over," said Jonathan Band, a partner in Morrison & Foerster's
D.C. office and coauthor of Interfaces on Trial, a book that
relives the great court fights involving software in the 1980s
and 1990s, Computer Associates v.  Altai, Apple v.  Microsoft,
Sega v.  Accolade, among many others.  "I don't see a case that
will capture the imagination of the Supreme Court and the
industry."

The Supreme Court's tie vote affirmed the First Circuit's
decision that Borland's copying the menu tree from Lotus's 1-2-3
spreadsheet program was not a copyright violation.  But the
unwritten decision has no precedential value and will give scant
guidance on what aspects of software are copyrightable
expression and what are uncopyrightable methods of operation.

                          HOPES DASHED

Most observers were surprised the court took the case in the
first place.  Once it did, there was widespread hope that the
justices would finally clear the air between the protectionists,
represented by Lotus and its new parent, IBM, and the
interoperable folks who brought the world Borland's Quattro Pro
and other products that have had depended upon their ability to
work with their competitors' products.

With the court so divided, it may be a long time before the
justices step into software waters anytime soon.  Justice John
Paul Stevens did not participate.

Even before the Supreme Court's ruling, there was already plenty
of action out of court to take care of what that might otherwise
take place inside the courtroom.

There is a multiyear effort, for example, to revise the Uniform
Commercial Code in an effort to give more muscle to shrink-wrap
licenses.  Companies have had limited success in court enforcing
software licenses because the buyer is unable to bargain over
terms and because some courts have found that the contracts are
an impermissible endrun of the copyright act (See related story
in this issue.)

Many companies are putting greater emphasis on protecting their
products through patents rather than or as a complement to
copyright.  This shift recognizes that courts have been
loosening restrictions over patents, while tightening the
requirements for copyright, and that patents have a greater
certainty than copyright.  (It's generally easier to interpret a
patent claim than to agree on copyright's coverage in software.)

Finally, Congress may be getting into the act.  There's nothing
like lawmakers on the loose today to divert attention from court
decisions tomorrow.  The Administration has proposed a series of
copyright changes in response to the threat and opportunity
presented by digital technology.

While parts of the legislative package are benign, it contains
proposals that have already divided the computer and software
industry.  In some respects, the Administration attempts to
accomplish in Congress what the software industry's
protectionist forces failed to do in court in issues involving
interoperability, reverse engineering, and fair use.

Over the next year, the time, energy, and money spent on
lobbying Congress on these issues will likely dwarf whatever is
devoted to similar court fights.

                             STASIS

Perhaps there isn't a blockbuster software case around the
corner because of a general comfort with the state of flux in
the law.  The sky has not fallen on the ultraprotectionists,
despite rulings such as the 9th Circuit's Sega v.  Accolade
decision that allows reverse engineering under limited
circumstances.  And neither has software become a giant visible
grab bag, into which competitors can dip and choose the best and
brightest features of their competitors' products.  The 2nd
Circuit's Computer Associates v.  Altai case lays out a broad
methodology other circuits are adopting to discover what is and
is not protected.  It's a confusing murkiness that the industry
seems to be learning to live with.

Change In Plans
COMPUSERVE TO OFFER PARENTAL/USER CONTROL
IN LIEU OF GERMAN BLOCK OUT OF NEWSGROUPS

Online provider does not want to face country-by-country
censorship decisions

CompuServe is close to lifting its global ban on about 200
Usenet groups that a German prosecutor said may violate
antipornography laws and will put in place controls that will
allow all its users--not just those in Germany--to block access
to
objectionable material.

CompuServe originally planned to block access to those groups to
only German subscribers but has backed away from that approach
in favor of so-called parental controls.

"We're really hesitant to become the Baskin & Robins of online
service providers, providing a different flavor [of content] in
different countries and cities," said Kent Stuckey, CompuServe's
business development manager and former general counsel.

At the end of 1995, CompuServe blocked all its customers from
accessing the newsgroups, many dealing with sexually explicit
topics and containing digital images of nasty stuff.  The
company said that it faced potential prosecution in Munich for
carrying the newsgroup.  Because CompuServe could not
technically block access to those groups to German customers at
that time, it put a global ban in place.

Earlier this month, CompuServe announced that it was developing
the technical ability to institute a ban limited only to
Germany.  But Stuckey says that, upon reflection, that approach
won't work either technically or administratively.

German users, for example, could access the system from a node
outside of Germany.  Moreover, it could force CompuServe to
configure the content that flows through its system to the
national, regional, and local standards wherever it does
business.

Stuckey says it makes more sense to put controls in the hands of
the end-user.  The controls will allow users to block material
that comes from within the CompuServe system and also from
outside the service, such as the Internet's multimedia
component, the World Wide Web, and the Usenet discussion group
network.  The blocking feature will be the digital equivalent of
brown paper wrappers that cover the "adult" magazines at
newsstands.

Stuckey says "we have reason to believe" that the controls will
satisfy the Munich prosecutor who was investigating the online
pornography.  CompuServe has about 250,000 customers in Germany.

Don't Post That Crypto
THE ZIMMERMANN IRONY

Gov't may be more likely to prosecute future cases
in wake of its decision to leave PGP author alone

Nearly five years after his popular encryption program Pretty
Good Privacy was posted on the Internet, Phil Zimmermann has
discovered he won't be prosecuted for conspiring to export a
munition.

Ironically, the three-year investigation into Zimmermann may
actually increase the odds of a prosecution if strong
cryptography is posted to an Internet site.  The international
publicity that has attended the Zimmermann investigation would
make it far harder for someone else to claim he or she was
unfamiliar with the government's concerns about the export of
cryptography.  "I think it would be easier to bring a case" if
the posting occurred in 1996, said Ken Bass, a partner in the
D.C. office of Venable, Baetjer.

Moreover, in 1991, when PGP was posted to computer sites, there
was not nearly the awareness of the global reach of the
Internet.

Today, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology distributes a
noncommercial version of PGP under a screening system that
limits access to U.S. citizens.

On January 11, William Keane, the federal prosecutor overseeing
the investigation, told Zimmermann's lead lawyer, Phil Dubois,
that his client would not be prosecuted.

Many individuals and computer companies believed the export
laws under which Zimmermann might have been prosecuted should be
relaxed to permit the free flow of strong cryptography.  They
believe cryptography enables free speech and that the
restrictions hurt the U.S. software companies that must dumb
down their products for export.

Like Bass, Dubois cautions that the decision not to prosecute
Zimmermann, a folk here for many in the online and computer
fields, should not be interpreted as a license to upload
tamper-proof crypto.

"Every year that goes by it strangely becomes more likely that
there could be a prosecution" because of the growing awareness
of the issues of cryptography, national security, and export, he
said.

If the government prosecuted Zimmermann, it would have been
forced to argue that the mere posting of PGP on a domestic
computer site qualifies as an export because it was
available--and found its way--overseas.  Prosecutors would also
have to show that Zimmermann, a security consultant who lives in
Boulder, Colorado, was acting in concert with the person who
posted the program.  Zimmermann himself says he did not post the
software.

                         UNKNOWN CLIENT

A California resident has taken credit for posting
the software in 1991 as a way to thwart legislation in Congress
that could have limited the availability of strong cryptography.
In various postings and articles, Jim Warren, a California
computer activist, journalist, and entrepreneur, has described
this person's activities in uploading the software.

Upon hearing that he would not be prosecuted, Zimmermann posted
a note to an Internet mailing list for cryptographers.  He
thanked his legal team and also "Joe Burton, counsel for the
codefendant."

Burton presumably represented this person during the
investigation, a
presumption Burton and Zimmermann's lawyers won't confirm.

In a later message, Dubois also cited the help Burton, who is
based in San Francisco, provided.  "He represented another
person who was under investigation.  To have made this other
person publicly known would have been an invasion of his
privacy, so we didn't.  We still won't, but we can finally
acknowledge Mr. Burton's enormous contribution.  .  .  .  Mr.
Burton labored quietly on behalf of his client.  He took the
case pro bono and did an extraordinary job."

                              NEXT

The government isn't commenting on why it declined to prosecute
Zimmermann.  One theory is that the government did not want a
trial to serve as a springboard for a public debate on export
controls and cryptography.  Another is that officials did not
want to put the export control regime at risk in litigation.
Zimmermann's lawyers would have argued that the law
unconstitutionally restricts speech.

These issues are not going away.  Bass, one of Zimmermann's
lawyers, is also representing Phil Karn, a engineer from
Southern California, who has waged a challenge to export
controls on free-speech grounds.  The case involves Karn's
desire to export a diskette that contains cryptographic source
code.  Although the government has permitted the export of a
book containing the same code, it won't permit the disk to leave
these shores.  Judge Charles Richey of D.C. Circuit Court is
likely to issue a ruling on the government's motion to dismiss
the case or for summary judgment in the next few months.

Separately, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is financing a
challenge of the export control laws on behalf of a University
of Chicago mathematics professor.  The suit challenges a section
of the Arms Export Control Act and its implementing regulation.
Daniel Bernstein filed suit after the State Department
determined that he would have to register as an arms dealer and
obtain a license in order to publish a scientific paper about
and the source code for a cryptographic program, which is
considered a munition.  The parties are awaiting the judge's
ruling on dismissal.

Lemon Into Lemonade
PHONE HOME, PROCD

Wisconsin judge rules that university student did not violate
shrinkwrap license by placing phone directory on the Internet

There's already a front runner for the 1996 award for, depending
upon your mood, either turning lemons into lemonade or uncanny
timing.

ProCD of Danvers, Massachusetts, is almost a lock to win the
award for either its quick response to a court loss or its
prescient timing.

The company last week announced that it would place 95 million
phone listings, which it sells as a CD-ROM product, on America
OnLine for customers to access.  "The main motivation for going
online is to expose the product to more people," a ProCD
spokesman.  "It's a brand-building project for us."

What ProCD neglected to mention was that two weeks earlier
federal judge Barbara Crabb of Madison, Wisconsin, had ruled
that the company could not stop a university student from
placing those listings on the Internet.  ProCD had sued Matthew
Zeidenberg, a University of Wisconsin computer science Ph.D.
candidate, who had placed listings from ProCD's SelectPhone
CD-ROM program on his Internet site.

The company sued Zeidenberg for copyright infringement.  In the
complaint, ProCD briefly claimed that he had violated ProCD's
copyright in the listings themselves (a claim clearly at odds
with the Supreme Court's 1991 Feist decision), but devoted most
of its effort trying to show infringement of the software
allowing users to access the listings.

ProCD also claimed Zeidenberg violated the terms of the
shrinkwrap license.

Despite having issued a preliminary injunction against
Zeidenberg late last year, judge Crabb concluded that copyright
law actually protected Zeidenberg's actions.

ProCD will appeal the ruling and has asked that the dissolution
of the injunction be stayed.  Zeidenberg, meanwhile, is
preparing to resume his online phone directory.  His site was
getting 20,000 "hits" a day before the court-ordered shutdown.

Coming so closely on the heels of the court decision, ProCD's
alignment with America OnLine looks like a way to manage the
adverse decision.

Not so, says Rob Levinson, the ProCD spokesman.  He says that
the America OnLine deal was in the works long before the court
ruling and that the two events are wholly unrelated.  Indeed,
many companies have found that the Internet and online services
provide an opportunity for potential users to sample
slimmed-down versions of their product for free.

                           SLAM DUNK

For example, America OnLine users can search the ProCD database
only by name, while licensed holders of the software can conduct
much more robust, granular searches.

Users can identify, for example, neighbors of a particular
person, or search the entire database by street name, a useful
feature if a voice-mail message is garbled.

Nonetheless, Crabb's ruling is hardly welcome, if unsurprising,
news for ProCD, for it permits licensed users of ProCD's product
to extract all the names and addresses in the database, despite
the shrinkwrap license, which forbids such a practice.

On each key point, she ruled in favor of Zeidenberg.

She dispensed with ProCD's copyright claim in the underlying
data in short order by citing the Feist decision, a case
informed by "a nearly identical context."

Nonetheless, Crabb displayed some ambivalence about this
outcome.  She said there was "substantial equitable appeal" to
ProCD's argument that "it is unfair and commercially destructive
to allow defendants to take the information plaintiff had
assembled with a significant investment of time, effort and
money."

ProCD argued that Zeidenberg should not have copied the software
onto his hard drive since that was not an "essential" step.  The
judge disagreed:  "This conclusion conflicts with both basic
patterns of computer use in the 1990s" and copyright law, which
allows copies if they are an "essential step" in the use of the
program.

ProCD also argued that Zeidenberg should be bound by the
shrinkwrap license, which says "you will not make the Software
or the Listings in whole or in part available to any other user
in any networked or time-shared environment, or transfer the
Listings in whole or in part to any computer other than the
computer used to access the Listings."

Crabb rejected that argument because Zeidenberg "did not receive
the opportunity to inspect or consider those terms" at the time
of the sale.  It didn't matter, the judge ruled, that Zeidenberg
eventually bought a second and third copy of the program since
"software companies are free to change the terms of their
shrinkwrap licenses between initial and later versions of their
products."

Even if Zeidenberg had assented to the contract, it is preempted
by copyright law, Crabb ruled.

The contract's "prohibition on the distribution of public
information cannot be squared with the purposes of copyright law
or with plaintiff's own compilation of data," she wrote, making
a special point of saying that ProCD is trying to close off
opportunities to others that it once took advantage of.

                             IRONY

"Had each of the compilers of the 3,000 directories that
plaintiff used to put together its database attached a set of
terms prohibiting further distribution of the information
included in its directories, plaintiff would not have been able
to create SelectPhone without negotiating with and compensating
each compiler for use of its data.  The Supreme Court's decision
in Feist allowed plaintiff to avoid these problems and create
its database without any fear of copyright infringement.  It is
ironic that after plaintiff has attained the benefits of
copyright law, it wants to prevent others from receiving that
same protection."

Coda:  The case was a maiden court voyage for David Austin,
Zeidenberg's lawyer.  He had been admitted to the bar the day to
original complaint was filed.

For the appeal, Zeidenberg will be relying on Austin and
another lawyer, Keith Napolitano, who is now in business school.

COPYRIGHT REGS ON PHOTO REGISTRATION
HAS PHOTOGRAPHERS, FINISHERS AT ODDS

Deposit-less registration proposal is running into opposition

A proposed Copyright Office regulation allowing photographers
to register photographs depositing copies of them.  The proposal
is intended to encourage the registration of photographs but is
causing anxiety among photofinishers, who fear that they will
suddenly be liable for statutory damages and attorney's fees if
they reproduce a registered photo.

"I believe in the principle of copyright law.  No one should
take the work of an artist, in this case, a photographic artist,
an make an income from it without compensating the maker.  But,
if grandma wants to have a copy made of a photograph she has of
her grandchild for her own personal use, should this be a
prosecutable offense?  I don't think so," wrote Henry Oles,
president of EPS Photographic of San Marcos, Texas, in comments
to the office.

Representatives of the photo industry say that photofinishers
are blowing the proposal out of proportion.  They say the
proposed regulations, which they urged upon the office, are a
realistic way to give photographers the advantages of
registration without undue burden.  Few photographs are
currently registered, often because the photographer does not
know which of thousands of images may eventually be published.
It would also be expensive to register the photos individually.

Even though the proposed regulations would make it easier for
photographers to win statutory damages and attorneys' fees,
those awards are unlikely except in case of misconduct, argues
Charles Ossola of Lowe Price LeBlanc & Becker, counsel for the
American Society of Media Photographers.  "There is no basis for
anyone who acts in good faith to worry about statutory damages,"
Ossola said.

Ossola notes that the photo industry had strongly supported
efforts in the last Congress to relax registration requirements.

Under the proposal, a photographer can register a group of
photos taken within a year under a single title, provided he or
she provides basic identifying information about the photos.
The Library of Congress may request to view 50 to 100 of the
registered photos and select five to ten images from each group
registration.  The photos comprising the group don't necessarily
have to be of the same subject material.

Photofinishers feel they have been double-crossed.  This summer,
the industry published voluntary guidelines on copyright
protection that were meant to discourage litigation and protect
innocent infringers from damages.  The proposed regs, they say,
undercuts the guidelines.  "Many in the industry felt this was a
landmark agreement we could work with.  Now before this
agreement has been tried, the Copyright Office is proposing to
give photographers new incentives to sue," wrote John Heafield,
president of Photofast One Hour Photo in Birmingham, Michigan.

Comments on the proposal are due at the Copyright Office
February 9.  The deadline was pushed back twice.  At press time,
most of the nearly two dozen comments received opposed the
change, but Ossola's group and the other trade associations
representing photographers had yet to weigh in.

Ossola played down the possibility that photographers would try
to abuse the relaxed registration requirements.  "If you go to
court and commit perjury, you get in trouble," he said.

In the Federal Register, the Copyright Office said photographers
"need relief now."  An official at the Copyright Office declined
to speculate on when a decision on whether to issue the
regulation may be made.  The proposed regs originally were
supposed to be issued as "interim" regs, meaning they would take
effect immediately, but photofinishers were able to change that
at the last minute.

Learning To Live Together
PRETTY GOOD GUIDELINES

The photo industry's copyright guidelines provide useful
insights for online community

Editor's note:  Over the summer, after protracted negotiation,
the photo industry released voluntary guidelines on the
protection of copyright.  They set out responsibilities that
photographers and photo finishers agreed to assume in order to
protect the livelihood of photographers and minimize the risk of
litigation for photo finishers.

The guidelines are remarkably adaptable to the online industry,
which is struggling with similar issues.  The roles of online
service providers and photo finishers, for example, are closely
joined.  Thousands of copyrighted works pass through the portals
of providers and finishers each day.  There often is little or
no opportunity to check that the customers are the rightful
owners of the works.

A useful exercise is to replace the phrase "photo finisher" and
"photo processor" with "online service provider" and
"photograph" with the more general "content" in the guidelines,
reprinted below.

The Board of Directors of the American Society of Media
Photographers, the Professional Photographers of America, Photo
Marketing Association International, the Association of
Professional Color Laboratories, the Professional School
Photographers Association International, and the Coalition for
Consumers' Picture Rights, adopt the following guidelines
concerning copyright practice for members of the photo industry.

All members of the Photo Industry should:

1.  Recognize the photographer or studio as the owner of
copyright in his or her photographs in most circumstances,
particularly in the case of professional portraits.

2.  Encourage greater enjoyment of photography through the use
of photographs, made in compliance with applicable laws.

3.  Encourage all members of the photo industry to educate and
inform their customers and employees of the requirements of the
copyright laws and the need for adherence to and support of
those laws.  This should include working to educate the public
that the purchaser of a photograph does not automatically obtain
the right to make copies.

4.  Provide reasonable notice to customers that the permission
of the photographer is necessary under federal copyright law in
most circumstances for copying or other manipulation of a
photograph.

5.  Support and work together to obtain amendment of the
Copyright Act to eliminate copyright registration as a
precondition for statutory damages and attorneys' fees in cases
involving photographs, provided, however, that the amendments
also bar any award of statutory damages or attorneys' fees for
innocent infringement.  The parties will work together and with
Congress to make clear the meaning of "innocent infringement."

6.  Recognize that when infringement occurs that's not innocent,
statutory damages and attorneys' fees may be awarded.
Substantial awards should be made in cases of willful
infringement, or repeat infringement after notice.  Where
infringement is innocent, no statutory damages or attorneys'
fees should be awarded.

7.  Endorse the development of a voluntary identification system
for copyrighted photos so that labs and other users may properly
locate, seek permission from, and compensate copyright owners
for their copyrighted work.

8.  Work together to promote the growth of the industry and
ensure that new imaging technologies are used in responsible
ways consistent with the rights of all concerned.

In addition, photographers should:

1.  Prior to completion of the sales process, provide notice to
customers of the photographer's ownership of copyright, in an
effort to avoid confusion about the rights of the photographer.

2.  Provide customers with the information necessary to obtain
additional copies of the photographs.

3.  Where reasonably possible, identify and mark their
photographs sufficiently to permit others to know whom to
contact to obtain permission to copy, electronically or
otherwise manipulate, or prepare other derivative uses of the
photo.

4.  Respond promptly to requests for permission to copy,
electronically or otherwise manipulate, or prepare other
derivative uses of the photo, although there is no obligation to
grant such permission.

5.  Give written notice to the photo processor when a
photographer believes his or her copyright has been infringed,
in an effort to prevent further infringement, to determine the
cause of the alleged infringement, and to permit possible
resolution of the matter without the need for litigation.

In addition, photo processors should:

1.  Notify customers that the photo processor does not copy or
manipulate photos bearing a copyright notice without the
permission of the copyright owner named in the notice.

2.  Provide notice to customers, where practicable, that
copyrighted photographs will not be accepted without the
permission of the photographer (e.g., "No Copyrighted Photos"),
when photo processors use promotional techniques, such as mail
order and drop boxes that are within their control.  Where the
promotional techniques are not within the control of the photo
processor, the person in control should be requested to provide
such notice.

3.  Educate and inform responsible employees about their
responsibilities under copyright law and established policies
and practices.

4.  Inspect the front and back of photographs submitted for
copying to determine if a copyright notice or other notice that
the work is professional (such as a studio name or logo) is
present or appears to have been removed.  In either event, the
photo processor should decline to copy or manipulate the
photograph unless the customer reasonably establishes that
copying is permissible.

5.  Inspect the front and back of an unmarked image submitted
for copying to determine if it is reasonably recognizable as a
professional photograph.  Questionable cases should be separated
from routine orders and brought to management's attention.
Reasonable efforts should be made to determine whether the image
is a professional image.

6.  Utilize the following guidelines in evaluating a request to
copy photographs which the photo processor has reason to believe
may be professional.

a.  It is generally reasonable for a photo processor to rely on
a written consent to copying or other manipulation from the
photographer or studio named in a copyright notice or other
marking.

b.  Where the image is identified as a professional photograph
by a mark, or it reasonably appears that a mark has been altered
or removed, it generally is not reasonable to rely solely on
statements by customers claiming a right to copy the photograph.

c.  Where there is no marking identifying a photograph as a
professional photograph, but there is a question about whether
the photograph is professional, it is generally reasonable for a
photo processor to rely on a written statement by the customer
that the customer understands that copies must be authorized by
the photographer and that he or she is the photographer, or has
received such authorization.

d.  Circumstances such as prior written warnings from a
photographer or prior dealings with a customer may indicate that
further confirmation is necessary.

e.  Copying or restoring a photograph for the personal use of a
customer may be reasonable in cases where the age of the
photograph or the circumstances are such that the photographer
or studio is unlikely to object to copying and all reasonable
efforts have been made to obtain permission from the
photographer.  The industry will work together to develop
further guidelines for such copying.

7.  Document a claim of "fair use" in writing by an identified
customer, with a description of a legitimate fair use, and the
copy or manipulation should be appropriate and limited to the
fair use purpose which is claimed.  The industry will work
together to develop further guidelines for such copying.  These
guidelines are not intended to strengthen or weaken the doctrine
of fair use as incorporated in the Copyright Act and as
developed by the courts.

General:

These guidelines only deal with activities by industry members
and are not intended to excuse or mitigate customer infringement
liability under current copyright law.  While the customers'
knowledge and application of copyright law and practices may
have a significant impact on the industry, guidelines for the
customers' behavior are not provided.  An industry member's
efforts to follow these guidelines should be viewed on their own
merits.

The Photo Industry agrees to work together to develop further
guidelines and practices relating to:

1.  Practical and effective means of identifying photographs as
professional photographs.

2.  Standardized copyright warnings.

3.  "Fair use" copying.

4.  Restoration and copying of photographs where the age of the
photograph or the circumstances are such that the photographer
or studio is unlikely to object to copying.

5.  Processing of undeveloped customer film on automated
equipment, where determination of the content of the latent
images and the detection of infringement may not be possible.

THESE GUIDELINES ARE PREMISED ON THE BELIEF THAT LITIGATION IS
DETRIMENTAL TO THE PHOTO INDUSTRY, AND FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES
WILL HELP AVOID IT.  THE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND TO THE COURTS THAT
IN CASES WHERE AN INFRINGEMENT HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE OCCURRED,
THE EXTENT OF THE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS BY THE PARTIES TO FOLLOW
THESE GUIDELINES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE
INFRINGEMENT IS INNOCENT, NEGLIGENT OR WILLFUL.Photo Wars

No Secrets
UNDAUNTED BY CRYPTO LITIGATION, CYLINK PLANS IPO

Despite a 1 1/2-year-old court battle with onetime partner RSA
Data Security that gets topsier and turvier by the month, Cylink
Corp. is planning to go public.

The Sunnyvale, California, company bares all about its fight
with RSA in documents now on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  RSA and Cylink are fighting over the
breakup of their patent pool that once controlled all the key
patents teaching public key cryptography, a bedrock upon which
electronic commerce will be built, if it is to be built at all.

 They are at odds in four suits and an arbitration, all
involving the validity of licensing of patents.  Cylink plays
down a negative outcome in any of the disputes, except one
involving the so-called Schnorr patent that RSA, a sublicensee,
claims covers the U.S. government's digital signature standard.
Cylink is seeking a ruling that a license for the patent is not
needed to build DSS equipment but acknowledges that its business
could be "materially and adversely affected" by a loss in that
case.

Cylink, which reported sales of $26 million during the first
nine months of 1995, hopes to raise nearly $50 million through
the sale of 5 million shares, or about 18 percent of the
company.  RSA has also reportedly considered a public offering.

It's no wonder.  The market for information security products
has never been hotter, now that the Internet is starting to show
its potential of becoming a commercial marketplace.  Lemon Into

ONE YEAR AGO IN INFORMATION LAW ALERT

Unisys Corp.'s demands for royalties on a popular method of
compressing data was causing anxiety and anger in those sections
of the online community unaccustomed to concerning themselves
with patents.  (Unisys has quietly been signing licensees,
including America OnLine, Prodigy, Software Publishing Corp.,
Symantec, Sierra Semiconductor, Goldstar, and 3Com Corp.)

The International Trademark Association formed a task force to
identify and examine the difficulties in protecting corporate
identities on the Internet.  Several recent cases had exposed
the conflicts between trademark law, which is based on a
first-to-use basis, and the registration of Internet addresses,
which occurs on a first-applied, first-registered basis without
regard to trademark rights.  (InterNIC, the government-funded
entity registry of Internet addresses, has revised its policy of
assigning names, but the changes provided cold comfort to
trademark owners.)

Lawyers for Phil Zimmermann, the inventor of PGP, met with the
U.S. Attorney's office in San Jose in an attempt to ward off an
indictment.  The government is investigating how PGP, a powerful
encryption program, made its way overseas in violation of
federal law prohibiting the export of such programs without
proper licenses.  (See related story, this issue.)

3D Fax: A Fix to an Imperfect Mode of Communication

Summary: 3D Fax provides increased capability and security and
lowered transmission times for lawyers and clients who really
should be using e-mail, instead.  But if you must use fax to
transfer long, confidential documents, 3D Fax provides an
interesting way to do it better.

                    ==========================

     We're certain that e (for "electronic") mail will be the
most important mode of non-verbal law office communications some
day soon. It might have happened much sooner had inexpensive and
easy to use "fax" machines not arisen to take e-mail's rightful
place in the communications pantheon.  But fax is only as secure
as the sending and receiving machines and all you get is a paper
copy of whatever message or document was sent; if you want to
revise the document, you still have to get it into your computer.
     This week we'll look at 3D Fax Professional, a program that
converts computer files of all sorts to easily faxable graphics,
then reads the graphics and converts them back to computer files.
The program is not particularly easy to work with, but may
present a solution, of sorts, to some of the inherent weaknesses
of the fax communication process.

[3D Fax]
     3D Fax Professional converts any computer file, including a
word processor or spreadsheet document or even a program, to
blocks of gray looking graphics, and eventually converts those
graphics blocks back to its original form.  The program's
standard format divides the 8-1/2 by 11 inch page into quarters,
with one  block occupying each quarter. A "fast" mode, usable
only in computer to computer setups, sends one large block on
each page.
     The user can send a graphics file from a computer fax card
to the recipient's computer fax board, or to the recipient's fax
machine.  If the latter, the recipient must scan the fax printout
to her computer, using a minimum of a 300 dots per inch (dpi)
scanner; the manual suggests a Hewlett Packard Scanner or
compatible, or any scanner conforming to the Twain standard.

[Installation / Documentation / Support]
      An automatic installation program run under Windows 95
placed about 1.25 Megabytes of programs and sample data on our
hard disk.  For some reason, 3D Fax wouldn't work with TSFax from
Commworks, fax support program we had been using.   Customer
support suggested we re-install the fax software; instead, we
installed Delrina's WinFax Pro 4, which worked without
difficulty.
     Toll free telephone support is available Monday through
Saturday from 7:00 AM to Midnight, Eastern time, however the
manual notes that the service is free only for two calls, at a
maximum of 10 minutes each.  In fact, we called several times
without difficulty.  The first time we called, the support person
could not answer our questions, took our telephone number and
called back with the answers a couple of hours later.
     A 150 page manual and good Windows help system provided
reasonable documentation.


[Using 3D Fax]
     3D Fax comes with a "macro installer" which provides macros
to use the program with Ami Pro, WordPerfect, or Microsoft Word 2
or 6.  (The installed doesn't really install a macro for
WordPerfect, but does tell the user how to do it.) We didn't
bother with these frills, but proceeded to work with files we had
previously saved.
     We loaded the 3D Fax "Send" module and selected the file we
wished to send.  3D Fax converted the file and "sent" it to the
previously selected WinFax Pro, launching that program.  We gave
the fax program the phone number of the intended recipient and
the graphics file was sent to the recipient fax machine.  We then
attempted to fax the pages back to the computer, but the 3D Fax
"Receive" module was unable to deal with those files.  We tried
printing the original graphics file to our laser printer and
faxing that back to the computer, but that didn't work either.
     The publisher told us a 300 dpi scanner was required.  We
hooked one up and after some image adjustment were able to deal
both with the laser printed and  faxed version.  We're not sure
why a 300 dpi scanner is needed to scan what is basically no more
than a 200 dpi fax paper printout, but that appears to be the
case.  We were not able to achieve 100 percent results, and
sometimes had to rescan the faxed printout to obtain the results
we wanted.
     Reading the scanned file required firing up the 3D Fax
Receive module, selecting the scanned file, then saving the
reconverted files back to our hard disk.

[Computer to Computer]
     Fax card to fax card operation worked without fail.  We
achieved the same result by converting a computer file to the 3D
Fax format and simply sending the file as a binary file, then
reconverting with the Read module.
     The vendor claims advantages of compression in conversion
from computer file to graphics.  To test this we created a 50
page ASCII text file, approximately 149,300 bytes long.  We ran
this file through 3D Fax Send and WinFax Pro 4, ending up with a
52 kilobyte graphics file which faxed to 3 pages of four blocks
each, and a last page consisting of one block. The full pages
took about 70 seconds, each, to fax from computer to a fax
machine, or less than five minutes for the entire package.
Faxing the 50 pages of text would have taken the better part of
an hour; of course, sending the uncompressed text file between
two 14,400 kilobit per second modems would have taken less than
three minutes. With standard compression, we might have reduced
transmission time to less than a minute.
     3D Fax Pro also boasts a password security feature. The
publisher is quick to note that the program does not use the 8
character password to encrypt the file as it converts it to
graphics, but merely sets the header to require the password
before 3D Fax will reconvert the file to its original computer
format.  We assume that one out of three high school students
could easily bypass the password requirement, but it should be
sufficient to prevent most secretaries and mail room attendants
from viewing the text until the password is supplied.
     3D Fax comes in three flavors: a free version has a limited
Send module, but can receive from all versions of the product.  A
one hundred dollar "standard" version is not limited in the size
of the file that may be sent, but does not have the password,
compression, redundancy and other advanced features of the two
hundred dollar "professional" version.
     3D Fax adds security, cuts transmission time, permits
transfer of computer programs and complex data, as well as

Crimefighter's Handbook

Summary: Computer Crime: a Crimefighter's Handbook is designed
for computer crime investigators, but should prove valuable to
any lawyer engaged in the representation of clients using
computers.

                  ==============================

     The criminal bar is increasingly called upon to prosecute
and defend "computer crime" matters, and corporate lawyers are,
no doubt, being asked for advice involving delicate computer
matters.   According to the preface, Computer Crime, the book,
began life as an FBI training manual. The book is authoritative
and reads well, and  includes listings of state and federal
computer crime laws, a sample search warrant, instructions on how
to execute the warrant, how to obtain computer evidence
(including evidence on how and why to gather than computer itself
as evidence).  We don't agree with all of the advice, but suspect
that the book will be getting wide circulation in law enforcement
circles, making it particularly important for lawyers on "the
other side".

[Details]

UNITED STATES:  CLOSURE IS ONLY OPTION FOR MIAMI FIRM

Christmas has not brought warm tidings for Miami-based Mershon Sawyer
Johnston Dunwody & Cole. Following the collapse of merger talks with
Shutts & Bowen, one of Florida's best-known firms, the firm decided to
close its doors permanently at the end of 1995.

The 75-year-old practice, which had three offices in its home state as
well as an office in London, employed over 100 lawyers at its height
but this number has dwindled in recent years. At the time of the
announcement, it is estimated that there were about 50 lawyers employed
in the firm.

According to marketing director Angela Spall, the firm suffered from
involuntary downsizing in recent years from several rounds of
defections to rival firms including Shutts & Bowen. The defections may
have been the result of a lack of direction within the firm.

"It was a very democratic firm and it was hard for one group to manage
well." said Spall. "It was like herding cats. There was no strong
visionary leader and too many agendas."

The final blow

The final blow came in September when the entire trust and state
department, which was regarded as the firm's flagship, left to set up a
new firm, Dunwody White & Landen.

"After that, the firm did not have the right mix of practice group,"
Spall commented. Other key practice areas within the practice were
litigation, tax and health care.

Before winding up operations, Mershon Sawyer approached several firms
in the city about the possibility of a merger, including litigation
practice Tew & Beasely and Shutts & Bowen. It was the final blow when
the Shutts & Bowen talks broke down and management responded by voting
to dissolve. The chairman of the executive committee at Shutts & Bowen,
Bowman Brown, reported that a lawyer who had moved to Shutts & Bowen
from Mershon Sawyer approached the management committee concerning a
merger. The proposal was considered because Mershon Sawyer was a well
respected firm.

However, Bowman said that discussions never went beyond the
preliminaries. "We reviewed the situation with a consultant and decided
that we already provided the services that they provide and saw no
significant advantage in a merger," said Bowman.

Strong financial position

The perception in some quarters was that the talks fell through because
Mershon Sawyer had made too many demands. However, Spall noted that the
firm was negotiating from a strong financial position:"The firm's
problems were not financial. We were very stable financially and held
on to our institutional clients." Clients included Citibank, First
Union National Bank, Mercedez-Benz, Chrysler and Miami University.

The fate of the lawyers working in Mershon Sawyer's offices outside
Miami is secure. The London operations were acquired by another Miami-
based firm Steel Hector & Davis, and the 11-lawyer West Palm Beach
office was bought out by Orlando firm Akerman Senterfit. The Naples
office has opted to go on its own and the Key West office is a one-
person operation.

UNITED KINGDOM:  GRANT THORNTON SURVEY SHOWS LEVEL PROFITS

Profits at UK law firms have levelled in the last year with some firms
experiencing a reduction, according to Grant Thornton's 1995
Solicitors' Interfirm Comparison.

Firms in the five to nine-partner group emerged as the group that had
suffered most with the number of firms earning high profit margins and
profit levels declining. Overall average profits per partner was down
from #71,000 ($108,686) to #61,000 this year.

Profits per partner for larger firms with more than 20 partners also
declined from #100,000 to #92,000. The results, however, of the most
successful firms continued to improve with profits per partner
averaging #178,000. The most successful regions outside London were
Northern England and Scotland.

GERMAN FIRMS GRANTED LICENCES IN CHINA

German firms Beiten Burkhardt Mittl & Wegener and Schulz Noack
Barwinkel have been granted licences to operate in China. Their arrival
strengthens the German contingent in Beijing where Punder Volhard Weber
& Axster, among the first batch of foreign law firms to enter the
country, had been the sole representative for several years.

According to Juergen Burkhardt, who will be heading Beiten Burkhardt's
operations in Beijing, German industry is very aware of the
opportunities to be gleaned in China, an awareness which was further
heightened by Chancellor Kohl's recent visit.

Along with Burkhardt, there will be a Chinese-qualified lawyer and a
German-qualified lawyer on board. The office will mainly be involved
with negotiating joint ventures for German companies and has gained
some work through one of Germany's leading banks Bayerische-
Vereinsbank. The China venture will be complemented by a new Hong Kong
office which opened at the same time.

Strategically, Burkhardt sees the move as beneficial for his firm with
China's economy set to explode over the next few decades. "European
industry has to benefit from the low labour costs and huge markets."

But there is a learning curve. Burkhardt believes that the Chinese
Government has become more restrictive in an effort to channel
investment with the result that growth may be limited. "We will have to
be patient," he said."Chinese are not used to the accounting system,
they are not used to working in a strict and orderly fashion - we all
have to adjust."

Schulz Noack Barwinkel is a small Hamburg firm whose arrival shows that
interest in China is high among law firms of every size.

RUSSIA:  LAWYERS RESERVE JUDGMENT ON EFFECTS OF ELECTION

With communists and nationalists the main victors in Russia's
parliamentary elections, foreign investors are worried. But
international lawyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.

"The parliamentary elections are unlikely to have a substantial effect
on foreign investment," noted Jacky Baudon, managing partner at the
Moscow office of UK firm Freshfields. "The presidential elections in
June and the election of the regional governors over 1996 should be
more telling."

LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae's resident partner Brian Zimbler is
keeping a close eye on the situation: "We are continuing to see a large
flow of investment and we understand that there will be political ups
and downs. The results are the sign of the difficulties of conversion
to a market economy."

Glenn Faass of Canadian firm Macleod Dixon said it is unlikely that a
communist president will be elected in June, but if it should arise,
the situation would be more difficult. But how much more difficult is
not easy to determine. "It is not clear what the communists are
standing for," said Fass. "They seem to sell a message to the audience
that the audience wants to hear."

LeBoeuf's Zimbler recently attended a meeting with Gennady Zyuganov,
the head of the Communist Party, and found him to be conciliatory to
foreign investment: "So if you take him at his word, there should be
nothing to worry about."

This is good news, but Faass warned:"The next six months will be a
period of uncertainty, and foreign investors who do not have to spend
money will not. This may turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy,
because if foreign investors do not continue to show support for
reform, then the voters may look the other way."

EUROPE:  COURT RULES ON ESTABLISHMENT

With the European Commission about to report to the European Parliament
on the draft directive on the rights of establishment of lawyers, the
European Court of Justice has confirmed that lawyers may, in some
circumstances, set up in another member state under home title without
ever having to register with the local bar association.

The court ruled in favour of a German lawyer who had been prevented
from operating in Italy by the Milan Bar Association.

Reinhard Gebhard, who is registered as a German rechtsanwalt in
Stuttgart, had operated in Italy since 1978. However, the Milan Bar
Association initiated disciplinary proceedings against him. It
reproached him for using the term "avvocato" and designating his office
as "Studio Legale Gebhard".

The Italian authorities sought an interpretation of the 1977 Directive
on Lawyers' Services and Article 52 of the Treaty of Rome, particularly
focusing on when a member state could intervene to regulate activities.

The court determined that this could not be done unless a number of
conditions were met to justify that the restrictions were in the public
interest.

The judgment is being hailed as a victory for the liberal
interpretation of establishment rights which won the overwhelming
support of European lawyers at the November meeting of the CCBE in
Dresden. At that meeting, lawyers voted in favour of a permanent right
of establishment under home title against opposition from the French,
Spanish and Luxembourg bar delegations.

Patrick Oliver, the Brussels representative of the Law Society of
England and Wales, said bar associations will now have to look at what
activities are being performed by foreign lawyers to determine which
conditions are reasonable or not. It is likely the French will put up a
vigorous defence to show that restrictions in French law are compatible
with the public interest.

The judgment strongly suggests, however, that it would be unreasonable
for a bar association to seek registration for a lawyer who is
practising his own or EC law in another member state. But, Oliver
cautioned, the judgment is "fairly general and only gives pointers with
regard to the establishment debate". It does not, for example, give
specific details on when a local bar can seek registration.

But he added that the legal position"is becoming clearer and clearer",
something that has eluded European lawyers for the last decade.

RUSSIA:  FOREIGN FIRMS APPLY FOR LICENCES

In spite of a lack of clarity surrounding the registration procedure
for foreign lawyers in Russia, most foreign firms have decided to apply
for the relevant licences.

Among the firms contacted by LI, most had either received the licence
or were in the process of applying for one.

US firm LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae has already received a licence and
its resident partner in Moscow, Brian Zimbler, said the application
process took only a few weeks and the attitude of the government was
friendly. "The situation is that the licence entitles you to advise on
law in which your lawyers are licensed," Zimbler said. "Nevertheless,
the situation is not really that clear, it is clear that the government
is recognising us officially. Yet it is not clear how the licence works
and the scope of the licence is also unclear."

Another lawyer, however, whose firm has also applied for the licence,
looks on the confusion in a different light and believes the lack of
clarity is just an excuse made up by some firms which did not want to
comply.

"Public policy requires that one must impose guidelines on the legal
profession and Russia has been one of the last countries to do so," he
said."Indeed, the restrictions are less onerous than in the
jurisdictions that the people who are complaining about the rules come
from."

IRELAND:  SOLICITORS MAY ACHIEVE HIGHER STATUS IN COURTS

In a controversial move, the Irish Government has permitted solicitors
to become supreme and high court judges after serving four years as a
circuit court judge. Previously, solicitors were only allowed to be
appointed district judges, the lowest ranking judge in Ireland.

The decision comes after a heated debate between the rival professional
bodies governing solicitors and barristers with the donning by
solicitor-judges of the judge's wig forming a major stumbling block.

In the event, the original government proposal - that solicitors be
eligible for direct appointment to the higher court benches -
 was watered down to the general satisfaction of the barristers.

James Nugent, chairman of the Irish Bar which represents barristers, is
happy with the decision. However, the law society's attorney general,
Ken Murphy, merely looks on the decision "as a small step in the right
direction".

With countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand allowing the
direct appointment of solicitors to the upper reaches of the bench, the
solicitors are likely to continue pressing for change."To exclude
solicitors from judicial positions is a relic of history and works
against the public interest," Murphy said.

With both sides lobbing well-worn arguments back and forth, a working
group is to be set up by the government to monitor the progress and
suggest changes. Representatives from both professional groups and
third party observers will sit on it.

Nugent does not foresee that there will be further change in the next
few years. However, Murphy intends to use the working group to actively
lobby the government.

INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION LAUNCHES HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE

The International Bar Association (IBA) has launched a human rights
institute which will operate through five committees located across the
globe. The institute will be headed by New South Wales Director of
Public Prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery QC and the former head of the Oslo
Bar, Tor Bohler. Speaking at the launch, IBA president Ross Harper
highlighted the importance of supra-national courts in securing human
rights gains. "The question of human rights is too important to be left
to the whim of an individual government," he said."While a government
may protest about a decision before the Court of Human Rights, it must
accept the decision. This is the essence of the rule of law - the right
of representation, a fair hearing and a proper determination must be
accepted."

EU CARTEL PROPOSALS

Proposals to encourage companies to inform on illegal price-fixing
cartels were put forward by the European Commission in December. Based
on successful moves in the US, the plans envisage the waiving of fines
for companies that are the first to inform on cartels, and reduce fines
for those that co-operate once an investigation has started.
Competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said it is preferable to
eliminate illegal price-fixing cartels, rather than imposing fines when
they are discovered.

EU BIOTECHNOLOGY PROPOSALS

A new proposal for a directive on the legal protection of
biotechnological invention has been put forward by the European
Commission. The absence of a directive would discourage European
research and put the European Union at a disadvantage relative to its
competitors elsewhere, according to commissioner Mario Monti. The
proposal takes into account the ethical concerns and calls for clarity
expressed by the European Parliament, which rejected a similar proposal
in January.

OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS

Bob Gordon of Hanover Park Legal Services discusses important areas of
risk to partners and partnerships that are rarely considered until it
is too late

ALL PARTNERSHIPS are potentially exposed to a reduction in cashflow by
the temporary absence of a partner. And while the absentee's workload
might be spread among his or her colleagues in the short term, longer-
term cashflow inevitably suffers.

The following four examples highlight the risks and the importance for
law firms to secure appropriate insurance cover.

Example: A partner is expected to generate fees of about #300,000
($500,000) during the next 12 months. None of the individual colleagues
either possesses the skill or has the confidence of clients that would
allow the practice to generate this income in the partner's absence. If
the lawyer is ill, he or she will receive an income of #100,000 per
annum during the first 12 months of absence.

The exposure of the practice is therefore the lost fees of #300,000,
plus the #100,000 that the partner will receive at a time when they are
generating no income - a total of #400,000. This is bound to have an
impact on the income of the other partners, who must shoulder the
resulting financial burden. If spread among ten partners, the cost
would be #40,000 each.

The partnership also risks having to buy out colleagues who retire due
to ill-health. The sources of credit available to partnerships are less
extensive than those to which incorporated companies can turn and,
unlike companies, partnerships do not have large amounts of liquid
assets on the balance sheet which can be used to pay a "golden good-
bye".

Example: A partner suffers a stroke and can no longer perform demanding
duties. The fellow partners must buy him out, each paying #300,000.
There are two sources of finance available: personal assets or borrowed
money. The former eats into personal hard-won wealth, while the latter
creates a debt to be serviced and repaid.

The above problems also affect individual partners, especially where a
disabled partner has skills not possessed by his or her colleagues or
whose personal contacts generate income.

The major partner risk, however, relates to permanent incapacity.
Senior lawyers will normally be taxed under Schedule D. Being self-
employed, they cannot participate in an occupational pension scheme,
but will instead have personal pensions to provide income after
retiring.

Two factors create a considerable risk:

* Contributions payable under a personal pension are restricted by the
Inland Revenue. One would have to contribute the maximum possible
amount for many years before a large fund would have accrued.

* Such a fund would be used to purchase an annuity, the "cash for
pension exchange rate", which will be principally determined by the
individual's age. The younger the person, the worse the annuity rate,
and thus the lower the pension.

The younger one is, therefore, the smaller the pension fund and the
worse the annuity rate. Solicitors are in a precarious position when it
comes to early retirement enforced by ill-health.

Example: A 50-year-old partner has to retire due to ill-health. He has
paid maximum contributions allowed by the Inland Revenue and has
amassed a pension of #300,000. The annuity rate for a 50-year-old
provides a"cash for pension exchange rate" of 30:1. A fund of #300,000
therefore provides a pension of only #10,000 per annum. This is 10
percent of his pre-disability income of #100,000.

EC ISSUES DRAFT ON BANKING DIRECTIVE

The European Commission has just published a draft communication on two
key aspects of the Second Banking Directive (89/646/EEC). Chris Ffinch
of Cameron Markby Hewitt, Brussels, explains its implications

THE DRAFT communication on the Second Banking Directive defines what
amounts to providing cross-border services, and also provides guidance
about what restrictions host states may impose on banks as being in the
"general good".

The Second Banking Directive came into force on January 1 1993. It
provides for a single EU-wide banking authorisation (or "passport").
This allows for a streamlined notification procedure when credit
institutions - and in some cases their banking subsidiaries - wish to
conduct banking activities across borders (right to provide services)
or to establish a branch in another member state (right of
establishment).

All a credit institution's banking activities throughout the EU are
subject to supervision by the authorities in the member state where its
head office is located. This is known as "Home State Control".

"Host States" - member states where a bank exercises its right of
establishment or its right to provide services - have very limited
supervisory functions. They can only insist that a "foreign" credit
institution operating there complies with certain rules - rules which
they have to justify as being "in the general good".

The draft begins by reminding readers that all credit institutions must
comply with the notification procedure laid down in the directive
before they start to provide cross-border services. It then comments
that, since the obligation is to notify only when cross-border services
are carried on for the first time, some credit institutions may not
need to go through this procedure.

These exemptions are for credit institutions which had carried on cross-
border services before the directive came into force, even if banking
services were only provided on one occasion. The only condition the
commission would impose is that the provision of such cross-border
services must have been lawful.

What is cross-border banking?

The draft then examines exactly what amounts to providing cross-border
banking services. It considers that this can be done in three ways.

The first is where there is "movement on the part of the service
provider", that is, the credit institution itself. This would, for
example, include where deposits are accepted in a different member
state other than through a subsidiary or branch. Deposits - or more
likely perhaps withdrawals - might be made from an electronic machine.

Alternatively, the credit institution might send its own
representatives for a short period to another member state, or it might
temporarily appoint a local agent there.

The second possibility is where it is the customer who "moves". The
draft considers that, where a customer leaves his state of residence
and obtains banking services from a credit institution in another
member state, there may be provision of cross-border services - but
only if he has been subject to "commercial canvassing".

In effect, where the customer acts on his own initiative, no
notification is necessary. On the other hand, if there has been
commercial canvassing by the credit institution in the member state of
the customer's residence, it has conducted cross-border services
business there. This way of providing services is likely to come as an
unwelcome surprise to some banks. Many have been under the impression
that, as long as they do not move any of their operations abroad, they
have not conducted cross-border business.

The third way in which cross-border services can be provided is where
it is the service itself which moves. This covers what the draft calls
"modern" means of communication, such as the telephone, fax, telex and
electronic mail.

Again, the draft distinguishes between whether the service is provided
on the customer's initiative, or whether it follows commercial
canvassing by the credit institution in the state where the customer
resides.

Advertising or canvassing?

The draft states clearly that canvassing amounts to providing cross-
border banking services. It reasons that canvassing amounts to an
intention to carry on cross-border services, therefore a notification
is necessary. This must be questionable. Effectively, a mere offer to
provide services is treated identically to actually providing those
services.

The draft then attempts to explain what canvassing is. It comments that
advertising is not necessarily canvassing, although making the
distinction is not always easy. The starting point is that advertising
is "simple promotion". Canvassing, on the other hand, can be one of two
activities.

First, it is where an advertisement is placed and is followed by a
journey to the member state concerned by the credit institution in
order to conclude a contract. So, where a credit institution places an
advertisement and intends to follow this up with a visit to the
consumer's state of residence, it provides cross-border services. It
must go through the notification procedure before contacting the
consumer.

The other way of canvassing is to issue an "actual invitation", at a
distance, to enter into a contract. According to the draft, an actual
invitation is an advertisement which contains sufficient information
(e.g. as to interest rate, duration and cost) for the consumer to be
able to make up his mind, or one in which, thanks to the methods used,
it is possible to conclude the contract at a distance (e.g. by reply
slip or telephone).

So, if an advertisement does not contain sufficient information for the
contract to be concluded without the consumer needing physically to
visit the credit institution, it cannot be an "actual invitation". The
advertisement does not amount to canvassing.

This is not an easy test to apply. What amounts to sufficient
information for one customer is not necessarily sufficient for another.
The test also seems unnecessarily strict; there is a danger that, by
including what it considers to be no more than minimal details and a
contact telephone number in an advert published in another member
state, a credit institution may be considered to be carrying on
services business there.

What credit institutions see as no more than a routine advertising
campaign may amount to canvassing and necessitate a notification.

Provision of services and establishment

Different notifications are necessary, depending on whether the credit
institution wishes to set up a branch in the host state, or to conduct
cross-border services there. Again, distinguishing these two is not
always easy.

The main conceptual difference is that providing service is more
temporary in nature, whereas establishing a physical presence in the
form of a branch has more of an air of permanence, But there is no
reason why cross-border services should not be provided permanently.

The draft focuses on a number of problem areas. One is independent
intermediaries. The key issues are how much authority the
intermediaries have to bind the credit institution, and how much
freedom they have. This freedom relates both to the extent to which
they are subject to the control of the credit institution (the more,
the more likely it is to be a branch) and the extent to which they are
free to bind the credit institution in relation to third parties
(again, the more, the more likely it is to be a branch).

In order to be a branch, there must also be an element of permanence.
The draft provides a cursory review of the case law and concludes that,
in order to be considered a branch, an independent intermediary must
act exclusively for a single credit institution, must be able to
negotiate on behalf of the credit institution and commit the latter,
and must operate on a permanent basis.

This conclusion is open to question. Certainly, case law does not
really support the exclusivity point; in fact, it seems rather to
contradict it.

Where an office is staffed by the credit institution's own staff, the
draft communication states that a distinction must be made. Where the
staff carry on banking activities, it is likely to be a branch. On the
other hand, where they are simply part of a contact (representative)
office, it is probably not a branch.

Finally, the draft discusses the consequences of a failure by the
credit institutions to notify, and the consequences of the wrong type
of notification. It considers that notification is an administrative
procedure and cannot have an impact on the validity of any banking
contracts.

The general good

The Second Banking Directive states that credit institutions operating
either a branch or by way of cross-border services must obey the rules
of the host state adopted in the interest of the general good.

The first main difficulty is that the draft confirms that, under EC
law, member states do not have to provide details of exactly what these
rules are. Clearly, this does not make complying with them any easier.
A more robust approach from the commission would be welcome.

The draft communication reviews the case-law relating to the general
good and confirms that any such measure must:

* protect the general good;

* be non-discriminatory and apply to the host state's "own" credit
institutions as well as to"foreign institutions"; and

* be proportionate to the objective pursued. It should be noted that
provisions in the general good cannot be applied to areas which have
already been harmonised, such as in relation to the solvency ratio or
large exposures. This would amount to duplication.

Examples of rules protecting the general good include consumer
protection, the prevention of fraud, the cohesion of the taxation
system and protection of the reputation of the national financial
services industry.

The draft also highlights what is often overlooked. In assessing the
proportionality (a sort of reasonableness test) of a host state's
restrictions, a different measure applies, depending on whether the
restriction is applied to a branch or to the provision of services. In
general, less onerous measures should be applied to services business.

Regrettably, the draft does little more than review the case law. It
does not comment on actual banking restrictions imposed by some member
states.

The commission's decision to consult on its draft communication is to
be welcomed. It should lead to a better text. Certainty is desired by
those credit institutions wishing to exercise their passport rights.

Nevertheless, a number of difficulties do exist with the text as it
stands. Interested parties have until the end of February 1996 to send
their comments on the draft to the commission.

AN INTERNATIONAL BONANZA

With the domestic economy flat, Canadian law firms are looking abroad
for expansion opportunities. Michael Fitz-James reports

In the domestic legal services market, Canada's 45,000 practising
lawyers are facing tough times as a flat economy means fewer clients to
go around. But on the international scene, things are getting brighter
and brighter, as firms large and small share in a bonanza from a
growing global legal services market.

Gordon Proudfoot, president of the Canadian Bar Association (CBA), is a
lawyer with the Boyne Clarke firm in Halifax, Nova Scotia and laments
the number of law students being "churned out by Canada's 22 law
schools".

This has, he said, created a dramatic oversupply of legal labour and
when students can't land jobs, they go into business as sole
practitioners. There are now 9,000 of them - 20 percent of the lawyers
in Canada - many working "out of their homes with a cellular phone and
a laptop and low overheads", Proudfoot said.

They effectively compete with small to medium-sized law firms and have
resulted in a net drop in legal fees across the country.

The only way for firms to survive, according to Proudfoot, is to
specialise, and that's led to the "boutique" law firm - six or seven
lawyers who practise in a highly-specialised area, like intellectual
property, taxation or labour law.

Other medium-sized firms have been broken up by poor market conditions,
with some members forming into boutiques and others being swallowed up
by the big firms, which increasingly consolidate into larger entities.

But there is growth in selling legal services beyond Canada's borders,
and that's being driven both by the increasing globalisation of all
economic activity and rapid technological change.

Wynton Semple, a partner in the medium-sized Toronto firm Zammit Dash
and Semple, has client relationships and business being developed in
jurisdictions as far away as Australia, and the firm keeps in touch
through e-mail and other communications technology.

The firm specialises in computer technology law and it increasingly
finds clients' problems arise outside Canada, mostly in the US, where
many opportunities exist because of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

For the giant "national" firm McCarthy Tetrault, which has 560 lawyers
in seven Canadian cities and in London, growth is unquestionably being
driven by the firm's international work.

"If we were limiting our activities to the Canadian domestic market,
there would clearly be a limit on our growth," said James McCartney,
Q.C., a senior McCarthy partner.

"The phenomenon of globalisation is affecting other high Canadian
corporations. With the rapid development of technology and the
reduction of trade barriers around the world, you can go anywhere and
essentially provide your services - hook up with your base in Canada,
produce documents and deal with specialists in the same way as if
they're down the hall at the office," McCarthy said.

For large firms, McCartney said, there are three "building blocks" for
the development of an international legal business strategy:

* working with foreign investors who want to set up deals in Canada;

* working with Canadian companies seeking deals abroad; and

* foreign "project work" which doesn't involve Canada, but which relies
on Canadian legal expertise.

It's project work where McCarthy Tetrault and other Canadian firms see
big opportunities for growth, particularly when their specialisation
positions them to offer foreign clients a particular expertise.

Canada's resource-based economy has contributed to McCarthy Tetrault's
extensive experience in the highly-regulated electrical energy, oil-gas
and mining sectors. As well, Canada is a telecommunications leader, and
the firm also has considerable experience there as well.

The firm has been able to market that expertise in a number of deals
around the globe including the privatisation of a gold mine in
Kazakhstan and setting up a telecommunications regulatory
infrastructure for the Indonesian Government.

"Internationally," said the CBA's Gordon Proudfoot, "Canadian lawyers
are nicely positioned for international work, because of the politics
of our country and the reputation we have internationally. We are not
as aggressive as the Americans are perceived to be, yet we do have all
those interesting nuances that come from the English law - plus Quebec
has a civilian legal tradition. We're seeing Canadian lawyers doing
very well abroad - that's a real trend that will continue to grow. The
international Canadian lawyer has a very prosperous future ahead."

While technological change may assist the globalisation phenomenon,
others see a worrisome trend in its efficiencies actually reducing the
need for legal labour.

"The understanding of legal problems and the search for their solutions
is increasingly being viewed as a branch of software development,"
pointed out Toronto's Wynton Semple.

"The client who used to pay $150 for a will can find a similar level of
service provided for $29.95 on the shelves of the local software store.
This `canned intelligence' presents a challenge to the practice of law
in Canada and lawyers are making a serious mistake if they believe
these packages are only purchased by low-level consumers," Semple
said.

Indeed, McCartney said, in larger firms, much corporate finance work
has been replaced by a multiple-jurisdiction software which clients
purchase themselves and use to generate prospectuses and disclosure
documents formerly prepared by lawyers.

In other technology trends, firms large and small are leaping on the
Internet bandwagon.

"The Internet phenomenon is amazing," Proudfoot said. "Canada is a
sparsely populated country and we love communications gizmos. Lawyers
are falling in love with the Internet - the concerns about its security
are falling away rapidly."

Governments both federal and provincial in Canada have finally decided
to reduce their staggering public debt load and that too is having a
major impact on the legal services marketplace.

It's an opportunity for larger firms, McCartney said, as "debt
reduction is driving a need to finance infrastructure in new ways - the
private sector is increasingly involved in financing roads, sewers and
waterworks. We're even acting for the province of New Brunswick in
building a new provincial jail that will be operated by the private
sector."

As well, in Canada's largest province, a newly-elected Conservative
Government is vowing to privatise many public undertakings - including
the giant Ontario Hydro, North America's largest electrical utility.
That will have a "major impact" on the legal services market, McCartney
predicted.

But for smaller firms and sole practitioners, major cutbacks on legal
aid are having a less-than-salutary impact on lawyers, who see their
incomes declining and a longer wait for their bills to be paid.

Many are looking for other areas of practice said legal marketing
consultant Mary Ann Freedman of Toronto, who predicted a dramatic rise
in professional negligence suits, particularly since provincial
governments are expected to allow American-style contingency fees,
where a winning lawyer is paid from the lawsuit proceeds.

Finally, there has been a significant rise in the number of in-house
corporate counsel in Canada, as companies seek to minimise the cost of
legal services. The number, according to Michael Crawford, editor of
Canadian Lawyer magazine is now around 5,000 and the trend of the late
1980s for companies to"outsource" all legal work to law firms has
reversed itself.

McCarthy Tterault's James McCartney said it is true the number of in-
house lawyers is on the rise but these handle mostly routine corporate
work which is fast disappearing from the larger firms' workload.

Now the work outside firms get tends to be in more specialised areas -
like taxation, labour and intellectual property.

The large firms, he said, have the people and resources to develop this
kind of specialisation and offer it competitively to larger companies,
which appear to be eager takers.

WHAT'S IN THIS ISSUE

I can't believe that this is the start of our 15th year! Little did I think
that U.S. Law Library Alert, as it was first design-ed, would evolve into
the LEGAL INFORMATION ALERT of today. When we started, law librarians had
only the AALL newsletter, chapter newsletters, and us. Then Bob Berring
started Legal Reference Services Quarterly, and others followed. Some are
still with us . . . and some have fallen along the wayside.

We are glad to still be here. We love this business--there is always
something new to learn! Do you realize how different legal publishing and
legal research are today from 15 years age? Throughout this coming year we
plan to keep you informed about the coming publishing and research
changes--and we expect lots of them!

Bonnie Fox Schwartz, who writes for both this newsletter and its sister
publication, BUSINESS INFORMATION ALERT, tells us all about EDGAR's current
commercial variations. The choice is yours, but she helps guide you through
the maze.

We hope you read all the reviews in each issue. Sometimes there are ones
worth noting here. Be sure to read Sex Discrimination in the Legal
Profession. Then buy it for your managing partner/administrator/dean.

Finally, a big thank you to our readers, reviewers, authors, publishers,
and advertisers. We couldn't have done it without you! Happy New Year!

EDGAR Update: The Proliferation of Commercial Products
By Bonnie Fox Schwartz

On October 1, 1995, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled
its home page, with access to the EDGAR database as its centerpiece. This
event occurred after the demise of the Town Hall EDGAR site and the offer
by commercial vendors--notably Disclosure and Global Securities
Information--to provide EDGAR access through their Internet home pages to
publicize their value-added products. EDGAR users are now blessed with
several Net sites, as well as a proliferation of related on-line and CD-ROM
products from database producers and document delivery services.

EDGAR, the acronym for Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval, symbolizes
the vast collection of corporate filings made directly and electronically
to the SEC. With more than 15,000 public companies required by law to
report on such activities as quarterly and annual financials, stock
ownership changes, and securities offerings; the SEC, by the 1980s, was
literally flooded with documents. Therefore, in a move toward a paperless
world, an effort was launched to automate the process of filing, reviewing,
and disseminating SEC information.

Voluntary participants engaged in a pilot project in 1984; and after eight
years, the fully operational system was launched in 1992. By August 1995,
when two additional groups were phased in, approximately 6,500 registrants
were EDGAR filers. All companies will be required to file electronically by
May 1996. Without EDGAR, the SEC would stagger under 10 million pages a
year.

With the full functioning of EDGAR almost accomplished, debate now centers
on how to make this electronic data accessible to the public. Even though
all the information is supposed to be available without cost, the data
exists on the SEC database only in the form of gigabytes, raw numbers, and
ASCII text.

The SEC initially chose Mead Data Central (now Lexis-Nexis since its
acquisition by Reed-Elsevier) to handle the dissemination of EDGAR
information to interested parties on a wholesale basis. (Mead also enjoyed
the contract to develop the initial EDGAR database.) Under this agreement,
the SEC would receive only microfiche copies of the filings, with Mead
retaining the electronic records and providing terminals for the public in
SEC reading rooms in Washington, New York, Chicago, and other regional
offices.

While Mead constructed the "back end" of this system, Compu-Serve won the
communications contract, which includes the receipt and notification of
EDGAR filings to companies. With EDGAR Link, registrants can file online
through CompuServe's network or via a direct connection to the SEC.

The EDGAR database has proven a daily necessity to a variety of
professionals, including attorneys, investment analysts, management
consultants, accountants, librarians, and information brokers. Since each
of these groups has specific needs, retailers of SEC filings compete to
provide products that access and search EDGAR filings easily and
efficiently. Each commercial vendor repackages and formats the electronic
data, in the process adding different software interfaces and search
engines to ease the retrieval process and make the information usable. In
addition, these competitors offer other products, integrated with EDGAR
data, to enhance the information and its presentation.

In the past, EDGAR "updates" consisted of endless recitals of statistical
charts detailing how many companies were electronic filers, how many
records were in the database, and phasing in schedules with future
projections. Now that three out of four companies file electronically, with
all expected to be computerized this year, an appropriate EDGAR update is
an overview of commercial EDGAR products as well as EDGAR on the Internet.
In addition, while law librarians, paralegals, and attorneys who use EDGAR
data share many priorities with accountants, investment analysts, and other
professionals, information needs peculiar to the legal environment will be
the focus here in evaluating EDGAR products.

Everyone insists on timeliness and accuracy: How quickly are the filings
posted? Are the companies listed correctly and in a standardized format?
Are tender offers and other ownership-related filings listed by target or
bidder/owner? Beyond these basics, users must always remember that the
EDGAR universe is not the complete world of SEC filings. Foreign issuers,
sovereigns, initial public offerings, and certain forms (like 20Fs,
Schedule Bs, 6Ks, ADVs, TAs) are not yet electronically filed. Likewise,
EDGAR documents cannot always include graphs and other visual materials.
Historical filings also are not on EDGAR. When a complete list of documents
is required, such limitations must be considered.

Searching capabilities are also crucial, whether the question involves a
particular corporation or precedent research. How easily can a company's
stock purchase agreements be located or can examples of specific types of
contracts with particular language be easily found? Can sections and pages
be quickly located, saved to disk, and printed out in customized reports?
This review will address such issues.

====================
Moody's Company Data

Moody's Investors Service, owned by Dun & Brad-street, offers EDGAR in
conjunction with its Company Data database. This product combines detailed,
descriptive information on companies (from the Manuals) with SEC filings on
EDGAR. One can search Moody's Company Data for more than 10,000 public
corporations and simultaneously access EDGAR filings on CD-ROMs. Moody's
EDGAR discs contain the full ASCII text of all mandated filings since
August 1993. Multi-font, multi-column printouts can be customized, and the
data can be directly downloaded to spreadsheet programs.

Features that enhance the accessibility of Moody's EDGAR files include:
searching by word or phrase with an EDGAR document; reviewing the index by
company name, filing, or file date; section and exhibit jumping; cutting
and pasting; and integrating document printouts with the Company Data
database. Moody's proprietary MoodEASE software allows searching by 160
variables including word, phrase, and financials. The program also enables
sorting by variables as well as peer group analysis. Printing options
reduce the number of pages as well as save on cost, volume, and time, with
an optional dual-column compressed print function.

Moody's also is filling the gaps both for pre-EDGAR historical filings and
for the most recent documents electronically filed after the last CD-ROM
was pressed. For old paper documents, Moody's promises to add the Workload
Index, a compendium of all filings with a computerized-link order form for
hard copies (those not available electronically) from Docutronics, Moody's
recently purchased subsidiary specializing in document delivery. For the
latest EDGAR filings, Moody's offers EDGAR Edge, a real-time dedicated
server with unlimited access, monitors for watches, word search capability
across all EDGAR documents, and additional indexes and tags.

Moody's presents a handsome, comprehensive package, especially for those
who have not previously invested in a large CD-ROM collection. Its Company
Data database, combined with EDGAR filings, covers a broad range of
business and financial information needs; and Moody's also offers other
discs on foreign companies--an attractive supplement. When anticipated
products are in place and all SEC filings are EDGARized, Moody's will be a
formidable competitor in the EDGAR arena.

===========================
Global Securities' LIVEDGAR

LIVEDGAR, produced by GSI Online, a division of Global Securities
Information, Inc., provides real-time, dial-up access to EDGAR filings,
with documents available as soon as they are filed. Although GSI Online
connects to the database via a dedicated line, its on-demand dial-up
service is a cost-effective means of obtaining EDGAR filings from any
personal computer with a modem.

LIVEDGAR is a Windows-based, menu-driven system, that enables searching of
filings in the entire EDGAR universe, since April 10, 1993. LIVEDGAR is
also the only commercial source at present to research the text of unusual
filings like S6s (unit investment trusts), mutual fund documents on N2 or
N1A, and other unfamiliar forms.

One can access the database by company name, SEC file number, or by
example. After a company name or file number is entered, a list of
documents appears. Once a particular document is selected, the user has the
option to search for a word or string of terms within the document. The
split screen--a convenient search feature--provides the filings list along
with a glimpse of the full-text with the term(s) highlighted.

Searching by example offers a choice of fields, including form, date
ranges, state of incorporation, stock exchange, SIC code, and free-text
terms. This capability over the entire EDGAR database makes LIVEDGAR an
excellent resource for precedents. When the search is completed, a list of
documents is generated, again with a split screen that gives a partial view
of the full-text with the search term(s) highlighted.

LIVEDGAR's printing capabilities have pluses and minuses. Exhibits are
always separated for easy access and printing of specific items. But if an
entire document is desired, a worksheet must be called up on a separate
menu, and a cover page is generated for each exhibit.

While LIVEDGAR is cost-effective, easy to use, and opens doors to filings
heretofore unsearchable, Global Securities does not fill the non-EDGAR gaps
with additional products. They must be supplemented by a competitor's
offerings for the complete documents picture.

==========================================================
Disclosure's Access Disclosure, Laser D II, and EDGAR PLUS

Disclosure Inc.--historically a supplier of SEC paper filings on microfiche
and CD-ROM--has now integrated EDGAR into its product offerings, with
Access Disclosure, EDGAR PLUS, and Laser D II.

Access Disclosure (formerly known as Electronic Company Filing Index or
ECFI) lists all documents available via Disclosure. While its major purpose
is to facilitate ordering, Access Disclosure also can serve as a research
tool because it integrates the EDGAR filings with the paper documents as
well as a range of non-SEC materials (like stock exchange listing
applications, annual reports of foreign companies, Euro prospectuses, and
Canadian filings) all into a single list by company, which dates back to
1968. EDGAR filings are clearly noted and can be viewed and printed from
the same computer terminal. Documents are not textually searchable on
Access Disclosure, however, although sections and exhibits are broken out
for selective printing. The first page of EDGAR documents is supposed to be
available for viewing free of charge, as a check for accuracy, but this
screen is frequently blank.

For specific document and precedent research Disclosure has introduced
EDGAR PLUS for word searching EDGAR filings. This CD-ROM product is updated
monthly. EDGAR PLUS is a full-text, value-added database of EDGAR filings
that includes extracts of non-electronic SEC documents. The composite of
information allows menu searching on Disclosure's 300 fields and format
tags, keyword searching, and displays of specific categories without wading
through entire documents. EDGAR PLUS features also are integrated into
Disclosure's Laser D II, which supports its formatting and navigational
tags for electronic filings on its laser discs.

Because of Disclosure's long prominence in SEC document delivery,
subscribers are familiar with its products and coverage and can adapt
easily to the new EDGAR product offerings. No other service, at present,
can match the retrospective coverage in the filing index, combined with
foreign company and sovereign filings, as well as non-SEC documents. Those
familiar with Compact D SEC and Compact D New Issues, will have no problem
using EDGAR PLUS, but may hesitate to rely on yet another disc, when
alternative online competitive products are available.

===============================
EDGAR PLUS on Lexis and Westlaw

Both the Lexis and Westlaw databases have contracts with Disclosure to
offer EDGAR PLUS. Since law firms subscribe to these providers and legal
information searchers are familiar with these systems, this convenient
access to electronic SEC filings provides a comfortable alternative.
However, users need to be aware of the currency of the filings as well as
the extent of the coverage. At present, periodic EDGAR filings (10Ks,
proxies, 8Ks) are searchable full-text, but the Williams Act filings
(tender offers) will be phased in.

Again, searchers must realize that not all companies are EDGAR filers, and
certain registration statements (like initial public offerings) are not yet
filed electronically. In the EDGAR PLUS files, all exhibits included with
the document are available online separately. Those documents filed prior
to September 1994, however, include only selected exhibits. While these
products have the advantage of familiar search commands, they do not cover
the complete EDGAR picture.

=============================
Federal Filings' EDGAR Direct

Produced by Federal Filings, Inc., a Dow Jones company, EDGAR Direct
provides real-time online access to SEC electronic filings the instant they
are available. EDGAR Direct is received through a dedicated line, as
opposed to a dial-up service. Windows-based software uses the "find"
command to search for particular documents and cut-and-clip sections;
converts to word processing or spreadsheet programs; downloads directly to
a network or e-mailbox; and manipulates fonts and text sizes. Searching can
be done by company name and file form, with the ability to create profiles
to filter out desired documents. Generated lists of filings can be grouped
by all, mergers and deals, high yield, or convertibles; and they can be
viewed simultaneously with specific filings sorted into appropriate
windows.

EDGAR Direct promises additional search capabilities in the future, such as
by ticker symbol, SIC code, and other fields. Most customers run the system
all day long so users are aware as soon as documents are filed. Such real-
time access is especially useful for investment analysts who need EDGAR
information instantaneously.

=====================
EDGAR on the Internet

The availability of the EDGAR database on the Internet marks the final
realization of Progressive Era and New Deal securities legislation
sponsors, who envisioned that public disclosure of company information
would enable investors to make prudent decisions. When the SEC awarded Mead
the contract to develop EDGAR and disseminate the data on a wholesale
basis, public-interest groups demanded free access to this information.
Jamie Love, of Ralph Nader's Taxpayer Assets Project (TAP), who has lobbied
for years to make publicly funded government data available, considers the
SEC EDGAR database one of the "crown jewels."

Ed. note: For background information, see the January 1995 issue of LEGAL
INFORMATION ALERT, a special guide featuring "Assault on the Citadel:
Romancing the Crown Jewels of West Publishing."

At the same time, Carl Malamud, who formed the Internet Multicasting
Service (IMS), in October 1993 teamed up with New York University on a two-
year National Science Foundation grant, to make EDGAR available on the
Internet. With additional support from corporations like Sun Microsystems,
HarperCollins, Persoft, and UUNET Technologies, the project was supervised
by NYU's Stern School of Business, while the database management was
subcontracted to IMS, who made EDGAR available on its Town Hall Internet
site (http://www.town.hall.org).

The Town Hall project provided a variety of mechanisms to access the EDGAR
database, from low-end and e-mail interfaces to high-end Mosaic
connections. This Internet EDGAR Dissemination Project allowed users to
obtain electronic filings made since 1994 on a "day-delayed" basis. Search
capabilities as well as printing options were not as sophisticated as
commercial products, but for the individual user or small information
center, the cost only amounted to basic Internet provisions.

With the end of the grant and the Town Hall project on October 1st, the SEC
inaugurated its home page on the Internet (http://www.sec.gov) with access
to the EDGAR database. Since this server is "under construction" at the
time of this writing and is expected to undergo changes over the next few
months, I will describe the menus offered.

The SEC Internet site enables retrieval of 1994 and 1995 electronic filings
available to the public. The service has two types of access: via Web
browsers or via anonymous file transfer protocol (ftp). You can log on as
user "anonymous" with a password consisting of your electronic mail
address. Searchers can use OR, AND, and ADJ, when entering terms, and
results are generated in a list of filings posted by form and in reverse
chronological order. Other retrieval tools include a quick forms lookup,
current events analysis, mutual funds retrieval/prospectus search, Schedule
13D ownership report, and executive compensation test extracted from proxy
(DEF 14A) filings. The prospectus report, for example, gives all "485"
filings pertaining to mutual funds of choice.

While the SEC Internet site appears to offer an equivalent replacement for
Town Hall (including a trade off between limited search capabilities and
low cost) two commercial vendors also offer access to EDGAR through their
home pages. Disclosure entered into an agreement with New York University
to continue providing full access to EDGAR by allowing NYU to maintain its
Web site without interruption. NYU can be accessed directly
(http://EDGAR.stern .nyu.edu) or through a link from Disclosure's home page
(http://www.disclosure.com). Its search menus seem almost identical to the
SEC's home page EDGAR site. At the same time, Global Securities offers free
real-time access to LIVEDGAR via its home page (http://www.gsionline.com),
although this service is a scaled-down version of the commercial product
and must be downloaded to a disk and added to the program manager through a
"special client program".

With EDGAR a reality, SEC information specialists must determine the best
means to access the database, search it, and present the data. Priorities
like currency, coverage, search capabilities, and value-added features
should be considered when choosing EDGAR products to meet your specific
information needs.

Items on Legal Tech, IAC, Matthew Bender & Folio, Lawyers Coop & Shepard's
Personnel, CCH Sold, Thomson Acquisitions, RIA Group, Legal Info
Management, Marquis Who's Who Lawsuit, Where to Get SEC Documents, AND MORE

By Donna Tuke Heroy

==========
Legal Tech

In November of 1995, I attended the Legal Tech show, which is sponsored by
Price Waterhouse. Held three times a year, it is clearly a marketing
vehicle for Price Waterhouse's legal technology consulting department.
Legal Tech differs from other technology-related shows in that it targets
large law firms as its primary market.

There were more research-oriented presentations than at previous Price
Waterhouse Legal Tech shows, and the sessions I attended were uneven in
quality. Sabrini I. Pacifici from Sidley & Austin's Washington, D.C. office
gave an excellent presentation on the use of technology in law libraries.
In "New Legal Research Tools," Professor J.C. Smith, a Canadian legal
theorist, attempted to explain FlexLaw, a product whose object is to
automate the management of legal information based on linguistic
connections between words. I'm at a loss to explain what this system adds
to the online landscape.

Another presentation by a partner at Baker & McKenzie, titled "Going
Online: Electronic Research by Trial Lawyers," was a thinly veiled overview
of what's new on Lexis.

More electronic legal research products were exhibited than at previous
shows. Lexis-Nexis is focusing on its Office product (which we will be
reviewing) in many of its trade show appearances. West Publishing Company
demonstrated its West Legal Network, which is still in beta testing and
also will be reviewed in LEGAL INFORMATION ALERT.

The Microsoft Network (MSN), a new commercial online service available as a
fee-based option to Windows 95 users, introduced its new Law Office
product. In the coming months MSN will be looking for partners to help
build its online venture. One of the first services to be offered is
Platinum Pages, a global collection of online directories of attorneys,
legal experts, and vendors.

The exhibits at this show are always worthwhile, but given the lack of
quality I witnessed in many of the presentations, I cannot recommend paying
the high fee to attend the seminar portion. Pre-registrants may view the
exhibits for free; otherwise, there is a fee ($20) at the door. For
information about future Legal Tech dates, contact PW Corporate
Presentations, 212-877-5619.

==========
IAC Update

Many readers have asked when our newsletters will be available on
Information Access Company's Newsletter Database. As you may know, the
ALERT signed the agreement to do so over a year ago. One issue of BUSINESS
INFORMATION ALERT was formatted and sent electronically. However, it was
not completely loaded by IAC onto its database, nor was it loaded in a
manner acceptable to the ALERT.

I felt that this was unethical. We have asked IAC representatives to reload
that issue in its entirety and as originally formatted. As soon as we are
able to independently confirm that our newsletter is electronically
represented on Information Access' Newsletter Database as we originally
intended it to be, we will commence formatting and sending future ALERT
newsletters.

In the meantime, both LEGAL INFORMATION and BUSINESS INFORMATION ALERT are
still available on NewsNet and can be retrieved for an extremely fair
price: $5 for an article (usually an entire article or review) and $20 for
the whole issue. The ALERT is seriously looking for additional online
outlets for our publications. If you have suggestions about where you would
like to see our publications, please let us know.

================================
Matthew Bender Converts to Folio

Abandoning its proprietary CD-ROM search-and-retrieval software, Matthew
Bender is converting its CD-ROM Practice Libraries to Folio, the industry
standard. By the time you read this 18 Practice Libraries should be
converted. This was one of the first things that MB's new CEO, Katherine
Downing, ordered when she joined the company in September 1995.

For more information on Matthew Bender products call 800-223-1940. For more
information on Folio, see our September 1995 article, "Folio Corporation Is
Improving Your Future," written by Kevin Miles of Haynes & Boone.

=================
Personnel Changes

Erik J. Heels has joined American Lawyer Media as Director of Internet
Product Development. He came from Lawyers Cooperative where he served as
Internet Systems architect. Heels is well known for The Legal List,
published for several years on the Internet and, most recently, in print
format as The Legal List, Internet Desk Reference, Law-Related Resources on
the Internet and Elsewhere from Lawyers Cooperative.

Gary Spivey has been promoted to Vice-President, Electronic Product
Development at Shepard's/McGraw-Hill. He was previously in charge of
citations development.

============
Merger Mania

CCH has been acquired by Wolters Kluwer for the sum of $1.9 billion. This
was a surprise to many law librarians. We hope that the incredibly high
price paid in the merger will not result in higher prices for CCH products.

Thomson Corporation is on a buying spree. Thomson Legal Publishing (TLP)
has acquired the topical products and other non-citation legal information
products from Shepard's/McGraw Hill. This includes some 270 print titles,
23 desktop codes, and 30 software products.

Librarians will be hearing from Thomson in a letter introducing the new
publisher. However, during the first quarter of 1996, servicing will be
done by a Shepard's transition team. Products will be divided as follows:
specialty titles to Clark Boardman Callaghan, state-specific titles to
Lawyers Cooperative Publishing or Bancroft-Whitney, and tax titles to a new
RIA Group (see below). Interestingly, Brian Hall, current president of
Thomson Legal Publishing used to be with Shepard's/McGraw Hill.

Thomson, through its Bancroft-Whitney division, has acquired Legal
Solutions Inc., a publisher of California-specific computer generated legal
forms. Recently Thomson also agreed to work with the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America to develop legal research products for trial lawyers.
These products will include national and state-specific print and
electronic products.

=======================
Thomson Forms Tax Group

Thomson Corporation has formed the Research Institute of America Group (RIA
Group), which is comprised of the former Research Institute of America,
Practitioners Publishing Company, and Warren Gorham & Lamont. Euan Menzies
who has been president of RIA for the past two years was appointed
president and CEO of this new group, which will focus on the tax and
accounting information markets. RIA Group parallels Thomson Legal
Publishing, and both groups report to the Thomson Financial and
Professional Publishing Group.

Visit RIAWeb at http://www.riatax.com for weekly tax news.

==================================
Legal Info Management Reports Sold

Legal Information Management Reports has been sold to Library Specialists,
Inc., of Marietta, Ga., which will continue the title starting with Volume
8, 1996. This is the first newsletter venture of Library Specialists, a
library research and management firm.

President Jane Miller says, "The purchase of such a well-respected
publication is a natural addition to the information services provided by
our company. Our goal is for our clients to be able to obtain all their
information needs from one source."

Future topics to be covered include an update on copyright issues and using
commercial online services. Back issues also will be available from Library
Specialists. For more information contact Susan Flugman at 800-578-6200, e-
mail libspec@ic.netcom .com or 71501.3431@compuserve.com.

===============================
Marquis Who's Who vs. Who's Who

Are you confused by mailings from a company called Who's Who Worldwide
Registry, Inc.? Don't worry. A federal court for the Second Circuit Court
of Appeals in New York has affirmed an award of money damages of more than
$1.6 million to the real McCoy, Marquis Who's Who. Ironically, Who's Who
Worldwide Registry, from Lake Success, N.Y., has declared bankruptcy.

===================
Need SEC Documents?

After you've read this month's lead article on the variety of EDGAR
products springing up, note this additional source for SEC products: FDR
InfoCenters. In the past, researchers had to go to Disclosure, FDR's parent
company. The change was made to convenience FDR customers.

Look for other new products from FDR, including a biweekly fax newsletter
(free to clients) called FDR Facts. For more information on FDR
InfoCenters, call 800-874-4337.

============
Briefs . . .

The 1996 Directory of Law-Related CD-ROMs contains more than 1,000 titles.
Macintosh-based products have increased dramatically too. Contact 201-836-
7072.

IN SITE: New Internet Site Additions: A Current Awareness Fortnightly for
the Information Professional--this succinct Internet newsletter identifies

Watch the Clock When on the Net

The Information Superhighway sounds great in theory, doesn't it? The
problem arises when actually trying to locate relevant material when you
need it. For example, if it takes you an hour to find something "for free"
on the Internet, but it was available for a minimal price on one of the
indexed commercial providers, it was not a bargain.

If you know exactly where something is located on the Internet and have
downloaded or printed such material from that site previously, it may be
worth your while to explore the Internet option before turning to
commercial providers. If it is unfamiliar information you need, now is
probably not the time to go exploring new territory--especially if you're
billing your time to the client. Later, after the information has been
passed along to the appropriate party, try looking on the Internet for it.
If you find it, you will know in the future where it is located. Also, when
you have questions about the source or doubts about accuracy, commercial
providers are always your best bet.

===============
Stay Up to Date

To find out what your users are most interested in, glance over magazines
such as ABA Journal, National Law Journal, or local bar association
journals. Since few of us have time to read these periodicals cover-to-
cover, nor do we want to, just scan them to see what topics are important
to your users. This can help alert you to upcoming trends and prepare you
for related questions. It also may help you when a patron asks, "I remember
reading something somewhere about . . ."

=======================
Keep Two Sets in Motion

Can't afford two completely up-to-date sets of a looseleaf treatise? If you
have two sets but stagger under the cost of keeping a second "convenience"
set current, try keeping the superseded pages of one set to interfile in
the older set. The older set then will be only one release behind in
currency, but may still be relied upon for quick reference. Caveat: Mark
the convenience copy prominently, and remind users of the importance of
checking the current set before relying on the information.

======================
Watch for Time Wasters

One of the biggest obstacles to working efficiently can be those subtle
time wasters. Here are some time wasters and ways to deal with them:

1) Being placed on hold. Use the speakerphone while you are on hold so that
you can work on other projects. Once the person on the other end picks up
the receiver, though, you should do the same. Most people feel that using
the speakerphone during one-on-one conversations is pretentious.

2) Friendly interruptions. It is difficult at times to find the proper
balance between being friendly and getting your work done, especially for
reference librarians who want to be available and approachable for work-
related inquiries, but not distracted or interrupted for chatting. If you
are working at your desk, try standing up when it becomes obvious that the
patron does not have a real question but just wants to talk. This often
signals to the individual that the conversation is drawing to a close. If
you are already standing, pick up a file or a book, or even the telephone
receiver. If none of these work, try simply saying, "Well, I guess I should
get back to work."

3) Meetings. Most meetings suffer from a lack of focus, thereby lasting
longer than they need to. Begin with an agenda. Gently bring people back to
the agenda when the conversation begins to wander. Set a clearly defined
time limit and stick to it. Such restrictions can help keep the focus on
the business at hand.

===========
Recycle CDs

If you feel guilty throwing away those superseded CDs, now you have an
option. As reported on law-lib, the listserve for law librarians, Digital
Audio Disc Corporation recycles old CDs. They may be sent to JADCORE, c/o
DADC Recycling Program, 300 N. Fruitridge Ave., Terre Haute, IN 47803.

Please follow these simple guidelines when sending discs for recycling:

*  All shipments must be prepaid and are the responsibility of the sender.

*  Send only the compact discs and plastic jewel cases, no cardboard
containers or other packaging components.

You might want to designate a storage box for superseded compact discs and
mail it off when it gets full rather than mailing one at a time. There are,
of course, postal charges associated with this program, but at least you
know you are doing your part for the environment.

======================
Inexpensive Incentives

The October/November 1995 issue of ALA News (from the Association of Legal
Administrators) suggests some quick and inexpensive gift ideas for
extending kudos to your staff members:

*  items with the institution's logo or name, such as t-shirts, water
bottles, coffee cups, fanny packs
*  movie passes or magazine subscriptions
*  lunch/dinner certificates
*  flowers, cookies, balloons, picture frames
*  free parking for a week or a month
*  time off or casual day
*  individual recognition, such as "Library Staff Member of the Month" on
the library's bulletin board
*  freebies from the AALL Annual Meeting
*  membership in an AALL Special Interest Section.

==========================
Additional CLE Information

In a previous column, I suggested routing MCLE seminar announcement
materials to interested individuals. Mark Carroll of ALI-ABA sent me a copy
of an excellent publication entitled The CLE Journal and Register. This
bimonthly publication lists CLE courses by date, by state, and by subject,
and also includes a listing of CLE Sponsors with addresses and phone
numbers, in addition to articles relevant to CLE issues.

If you oversee the CLE functions in your institution, you will find this
serial very useful. The cost is $75 and subscriptions can be obtained from
ALI-ABA, 4025 Chestnut St., Philadelphia, PA 19104.

EMPLOYMENT LAW --
Privacy in Employment Law

Matthew W. Finkin. 1995. BNA Books.
Hardcover. 477p. ISBN: 0-87179-883-2. $110.

Rapid advances in technology have made electronic eavesdropping a
possibility for an ever-increasing number of companies. Global competition
has only intensified long-standing employer interest in hiring the best
possible employees, monitoring their productivity, and ensuring that costs
are kept as low as possible (especially healthcare costs). These
developments have wrought conflict over privacy in the workplace.

For an emerging area of law governed by a tangle of state and federal
statutes, regulations, nonbinding administrative guidance, constitutional
provisions, and common law principles, a fully developed treatise would be
a welcome addition to any labor and employment lawyer's bookshelf.
Unfortunately, this is not the objective of Finkin's Privacy in Employment
Law, nor may it be a realistic ambition given the immaturity of this area
of law. The goal of his work is to offer a set of guideposts through the
maze of privacy rights in the workplace.

Privacy in Employment Law is a three-part work consisting of a primer,
state statutes, and sample business forms. The intended scope of the primer
is ambitious given its brevity. It covers medical, genetic, drug, alcohol,
tobacco and psychological screening; disclosure and access to records;
background and credit checks; monitoring employee performance through
surveillance, electronic interception, and eavesdropping; and employer
control of employee political, religious, and sexual conduct and
expression. Finkin does not seek to develop legal theories for testing the
law in the private employment sector. Nevertheless, because it is such an
unsettled area of the law, an author cannot help but indulge in speculation
on the shape of the law yet to be written.

Part 2 reprints state statutes on polygraph and lie detection, drug
testing, use of tobacco and alcohol, and access to personnel records from
BNA's Individual Employee Rights Manual. Part 3 comprises sample business
forms reprinted from BNA's Policy and Practice Series.

For individual attorneys and small firms with very limited labor and
employment practices, Finkin's Privacy in Employment Law will serve as a
handy and convenient finding tool. However, in these times of tight
budgets, it is not a best buy for libraries that support significant
employment practices and already subscribe to BNA's Policy and Practice
series and Labor Relations Reporter. The cost of this one-volume work is
competitive with the companion volumes published by Wiley, which consists
of Decker's Employee Privacy Law and Practice and Employee Privacy: Forms
and Procedure, but it also is largely duplicative.

EMPLOYMENT LAW --
Sex Discrimination in the Legal Profession

Bernard F. Lentz & David N. Laband. 1995. Quorum Books.
Hardcover. 256p. ISBN: 0-89930-928-3. $49.95.

Using the 1984 and 1990 National Surveys of Career Satisfaction/Dissatis-
faction administered by the Young Lawyers Division of the ABA, economists
Bernard Lentz and David Laband explore the complex dynamics of sexual
discrimination as experienced by women lawyers. This book is the result of
their effort to reconcile their 1991 study--which showed no significant
differences in salary and promotion between women lawyers and their male
counterparts--with those of two other earlier studies that came to contrary
conclusions.

The authors conclude that the earlier raw numbers showed an income gap
between male and female lawyers that can be explained by reasons other than
discrimination: primarily by the fact that women entered the profession in
large numbers relatively recently and were, therefore, less experienced and
less likely to be partners than men as a group. Because the experience gap
had narrowed by 1990, when Lentz and Laband undertook their study, that
factor had become statistically insignificant.

This book is an extended quantitative analysis of the data produced by the
ABA surveys; therefore, it may be heavy-going for attorneys without the
appropriate background. If nothing else, the book explores the complex
nature of sexual discrimination and demonstrates how little of the picture
can be seen through the simplest, usually evaluated, indicators, namely
earnings and promotions. Although there seems to be no significant
differences between the two groups based on these measures, the ABA surveys
showed a significant difference in the perceptions of the female attorneys.

How can we explain the discrepancy between the hard numbers and the
perceptions of the individuals within the profession? The authors postulate
that because attorneys are familiar with the law on sex discrimination,
they now make sure that there is no disparity on these measures. However,
the authors could not discount the convictions of the women surveyed that
such discrimination is still prevalent. This caused them to move beyond the
data in the surveys and discuss the multitude of ways that sex
discrimination can occur--whether by superiors, coworkers, clients, judges,
or juries.

Covert discrimination breeds intimidation and lack of trust, which causes
women to alter their behavior and thereby give employers the justification
they need to discriminate on performance grounds. The higher percentage of
women in the corporate, public sector, or small firm settings may be the
result of women choosing these settings due to the discrimination they
experience in other areas. Or, a client may complain to a woman's
supervisor that she didn't perform adequately when, in reality, the client
simply dislikes working with women.

Similarly, a jury may not reach a verdict for a woman's client due to
sexual bias on the part of some jury members. That adverse result may
consequently affect her standing in the firm, because that underlying bias
is not apparent to those judging her performance. It is because this third-
party bias is not always apparent to employers that the authors conclude
that the Title VII imposition of liability on employers for third-party
bias is probably inefficient.

Ironically, the authors ultimately conclude that the data's "objective
factors," such as earnings and promotion, don't tell the real story.
Therefore, they use the survey figures on individuals' perceptions of
discrimination to conclude that these feelings of discrimination cannot be
dismissed. For this reason, it may be unconvincing to those searching for
hard evidence. However, Sex Discrimination in the Legal Profession is
invaluable in showing the gap between individuals' perceptions of men and
women lawyers, and in developing arguments of how the complex dynamics of
sex discrimination may belie the figures.

ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT --
ELR: The Environmental Law Reporter

Environmental Law Institute. 1995. Clark Boardman Callaghan.
CD-ROM service, monthly & ELR Update supplements, 36 per year. $2,295.

The Environmental Law Reporter, already one of the finest environmental
reporters on the market in its looseleaf format, will probably become one
of the finest environmental reporters in CD-ROM format. I say "probably"
because with each release, Clark Boardman Callaghan (CBC) improves the
product, even though they are three to four weeks late each month. We
subscribe to both the print and CD-ROM, and our preference is moving toward
the CD-ROM for its ease of use and accessibility on the Wide Area Network.

Using the popular Folio software, this product makes research easy to
accomplish. Printing documents, however, is another matter. Rather than
inputting each document as a record, CBC has made each sentence a record,
which necessitates blocking the text to be printed. CBC developers need to
correct this and I am sure they will. It also would help if documents could
be printed as they appear in the print product: in dual-column format.

Product features include providing access through 10 formal information
categories. The categories, which follow the printed materials closely,
include Administrative Materials, Cases, Code of Federal Regulations, News
and Analysis, Statutes, State Regulations, Federal Register, Litigation
Documents, International Treaties, and Index. Each category may be opened
and searched, and there are plenty of jump-links to other documents.

How mature is this product? Well, each release is a tighter, better-linked
product than the previous one. If one Folio CD-ROM product could be held as
a standard for its ease of use and maturity, in my opinion it would be
Lawyers Cooperative's United States Code Service. ELR: The Environmental
Law Reporter is not far behind.

I recommend this product for high-volume researchers trying to reduce
online costs. It also would be ideal for organizations moving into the
electronic library concept.

HEALTH LAW --
When Life Ends: Legal Overviews, Medicolegal Forms, and Hospital Policies

Arthur S. Berger. 1995. Praeger Publishers.
Hardcover. 208p. ISBN: 0-275-94620-7. $59.95.

The Patient Self-Determination Act was enacted in 1990 to promote citizen
awareness of and participation in advance directives for health care.
Although its aim was to encourage individuals and families to thoughtfully
discuss and make healthcare decisions in advance; for most patients, the
introduction to options regarding treatment and advance directives comes
upon admission to a healthcare facility. At that time, patients are often
too sick, confused, or panicky to make thoughtful decisions; and family
members face, in addition to fear and stress, a bewildering paper blizzard.
One hospital study showed that less that one percent of the patients
surveyed later understood or were aware of the materials on advance
directives that they had received upon admission.

Obviously, better methods of communications are needed. Medical personnel,
healthcare administrators, social workers, and attorneys should all be more
familiar with advance directives in order to inform individuals of their
rights. These professionals also should encourage their clients to prepare
for these situations and work to ensure that the healthcare institutions
with the appropriate policies in place are prepared to honor the advance
directives of their patients.

In the first part of the book, author Berger discusses in plain language
six areas of concern: refusal of life-sustaining treatment, advance
directives, surrogate decision making, withholding/withdrawing life-
sustaining treatment, DNR orders, and PSDA. Berger clearly and succinctly
analyzes the legal, ethical, and medical questions involved--always
emphasizing the individual's rights. He ties in the landmark legal cases,
and points out the essential elements of institutional policies and
medicolegal forms for each topic.

In the second half, sample policies and forms--including optional clauses
for pregnant or minor patients and other exceptional situations--are
numerically keyed to the text. Berger suggests that using such forms and
policies--first, to ensure that patients' wishes are expressed and honored,
and second, to protect the medical personnel and institutions from
liability--also will promote patient-centered health care. A detailed
index, a table of cases, a bibliography, and a list of legal citations
provide access to both the contents and to other related materials.
Specific state statutes are not included.

Although written primarily for physicians and hospital administrators, When
Life Ends is certainly appropriate, and perhaps even essential reading for
attorneys (and their clients) working in health fields, estate planning,
and elder law, as well as for social workers, clergy, and private citizens.
End-of-life decisions will surely touch many of us either as caregivers,
relatives, or patients. When Life Ends provides an objective framework for
this often difficult, emotional subject. It is unreservedly recommended for
law libraries, medical libraries, and social services collections in
universities.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY --
BNA's Intellectual Property Library on CD-ROM

1995. The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.
CD-ROM. 2 discs. $1,750. Monthly updates.

BNA's Intellectual Property Library on CD-ROM contains the full-text of
BNA's U.S. Patents Quarterly (USPQ), 1st and 2nd Series, which comprises
all intellectual property decisions of the federal and state courts and
administrative agencies, as well as U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit decisions.

The archival disc covers volumes 68 to 231 of the USPQ, 1st Series (1946 to
1986 cases). The subscription disc, which is updated monthly, covers the
Second Series of USPQ and the Federal Circuit cases. Each disc also
contains Finding Aids, Topical Index, Classification Outline, Conversion
Table, and Parallel Citations.

This is a Folio Views product that runs in the Windows environment. There
are hypertext links, easy-to-use pull-down menus, and the capacity to
manipulate and customize text, store the executed searches, download, and
print. BNA provides numerous helpful resources to facilitate use of this
CD-ROM. There is a "Quick Start Guide," a "Quick Reference Card," and a
complete looseleaf user guide. The user guide is updated each month by
online and print versions of CD News, which includes "User Hints" and "List
of New Cases." Online help, an online tutorial, and a 22-minute video,
"Getting the Most Out of BNA's Intellectual Property Library on CD-ROM,"
round out a useful introduction to the product's features. BNA also
provides excellent telephone support and search assistance.

There are three customized query templates for conducting searches.
Template 1 searches by "Words of Phrases," template 2 by "Any Field
Combination," and template 3 by "Case Citation." Any Field Combination is
most useful because it allows searching by all of the following: attorney
name, case name, citation number, cited cases, classification number,
decision date, docket number, headnotes, judge, jurisdiction, particular
patents (by patent number or description), and words in the text of the
case. Intellectual Property Library also has the ability to expand or limit
your searches, for example, to include or exclude unpublished cases.

The Words or Phrases template is quite limited because the search logic
used in proximity searching is so unconventional. For example, to search
"trademark within 3 words of infringement," you enter "trademark
infringement"@3. Complex queries are very difficult because truncated terms
cannot be used within the proximity search.

It would be helpful if BNA added a time-tracker for accurate time-keeping;
as well as an opening-screen notice indicating the disc date and the latest
USPQ included therein. This information is provided in the print and online
versions of CD News.

Except for the phrase-searching limitations mentioned above, BNA's
Intellectual Property Library on CD-ROM is a very useful product. It will
save research time as well as online research costs.

Legal Research Guide to Mechanical Patent Litigation

Adam V. Floyd. 1995. William S. Hein & Co.
Hardcover. 95p. ISBN: 0-89941-906-2. $37.

This volume, the "culmination" of a student research project, is one of
many research guides published by Hein. According to the author, it
attempts to provide novice patent attorneys with methods and tips for
researching patent litigation. However, the guide is so well written, it
also is suitable for law students and the general public. New attorneys
will find the guide helpful, and those with experience in the area may want
to consult it as a refresher.

It is divided into three main sections: best, secondary, and primary
sources. The author also includes a people sources section, with
information on locating attorneys, judges, and associations that have
knowledge of mechanical patent law and litigation. This volume has a table
of contents (but no index), a table of abbreviations, and charts of patent
and patent-related databases on Westlaw and Lexis. The subsection on
locating books includes a brief discussion of Internet searching.

The research guide provides only cursory coverage of computer patent and
bio-technical litigation, pre-constitutional sources of patent protection,
and patent statutes before the Patent Act of 1952. Additionally, patent
prosecution sources and transactional aspects of patents are not included.
This research guide to mechanical patent litigation is appropriate for law
firms specializing in patent litigation, law school libraries, and
depository libraries that house patent information.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY --
Software and Intellectual Property Protection:
Copyright and Patent Issues for Computer and Legal Professionals

Bernard A. Galler. 1995. Quorum Books.
Hardcover. 224p. ISBN: 0-89930-974-7. $55.

Author Bernard A. Galler is not an attorney, but an expert witness on
computers who has participated extensively in some of the most influential
trials involving software disputes. In this book, Galler aims to inform
readers about copyright and patent issues that affect computer and legal
professionals.

Almost everyone uses computers in their homes or in their workplaces to
some extent, so almost everyone uses software and hardware. Having become
such an integral part of life in the 1990s, computers seem to have been
around much longer, but in fact have only come of age in the last 45 years.
Therefore, the body of law that developed to protect intellectual property
earlier in the century is inadequate to address the legal issues of today's
computer age. With the rise in importance of computers there likewise comes
a pressing need for laws that govern the intellectual property rights of
computer hardware and software inventors.

Galler has made every effort to make the current state of computer software
and intellectual property laws accessible to his varied intended audience
of business executives, legal professionals, and the general public. For
readers with little computer background, Galler has included an extensive
appendix, which details the basic fundamentals of computer technology.

The book begins with an overview of the laws governing computer
intellectual property, and the remainder of the book focuses on the common
law and judicial interpretation of the related statutes. Chapters 1 and 2
discuss the basic copyright issues; chapter 3, software-related patents;
and chapters thereafter involve the copyright issues and litigation that
have been influential in the software copyright arena.

In many respects Galler realizes his goal of writing a book that is
accessible to his wide audience. He does not use complex sentence
structures nor overuse technical terminology. He emphasizes understanding
the fundamentals of copyright law and goes forward from that established
foundation. A good example is his discussion of the difference between an
expression and an idea. "An idea that leads to a particular kind of
invention can be patented, while the expression of an idea must be
copyrighted to be protected."

A separate outline of the cases discussed allows interested readers to
grasp the courts' actions and roles in making the laws. In addition, he
includes an example of a patent and an excerpt from a court opinion. These
all help readers to visualize what the court is examining in trials and
what the lawyers are examining to determine that law. Numerous hypothetical
situations also convey the information in an understandable way. Galler
does not include many endnotes (which sometimes tend to discourage lay
readers)--unnecessary since most of his discussions are based on the cases.

Sometimes Galler's work becomes laborious--not the fault of his writing
style or technique, but of the subject matter. Often the decisions in
intellectual property cases involving computer hardware or software turn on
very technical details. Without an understanding or a basic explanation of
the technical issues at stake, the gravity of the decision and the
distinctions that the court draws will make no sense to readers.

This book is excellent for an academic collection, because it will help
those considering a career in intellectual property. It also is helpful for
lay readers who foresee becoming entangled in an intellectual property
dispute. Finally, for attorneys who do not typically practice in this area,
Software and Intellectual Property Protection provides a broad overview of
the current status of the copyright laws impacting software.

INTERNATIONAL & FOREIGN LAW --
European Union Law Guide

Philip Raworth, ed. 1995. Oceana Publications, Inc.
Looseleaf. 3v. ISBN: 0-379-10175-0. $495. Quarterly supplements.

The continuing process of European integration, including the discussions
leading to a common European monetary system, has furthered an interest in
the documentation and legislative process of the European Union in both
academic and private sectors. A major component of this interest involves
the acquisition and use of the documentation generated by the Union. While
the Union generates voluminous amounts of material, researching Union law
has never been an easy process. The Union itself provides no subject
compilation of its law, and the indexes provided by private publishers
usually do not provide the actual documents. European Union Law Guide,
aimed at law firms and academic libraries, attempts to fill this breach.

The guide is essentially a collection of documents with little or no
narration or analysis. It is a worthwhile addition to experienced
researchers' libraries, especially if they do not have access to a
collection of the Union's Official Journal, since the majority of the
documents in the collection are from this source. The table of contents
checklist includes references to "all legislation of any importance," the
most important documents are reproduced.

Currently, the guide offers access to the commercial and constitutional
documents of the Union. Arranged in subject areas familiar to American
lawyers, the goal is to provide access to all applicable Union legislation.
Among the subject areas included are public procurement law; banking law;
and the law of gender equality. When completed, the series will consist of
five binders that will include materials on social as well as agricultural
policies. A binder on the history, politics, and institutions of the Union
is also planned.

The guide strives to provide "comprehensive legal and political coverage of
the Union." While this is a worthy objective, it does come at a hefty
price: $495. Four to five updates per years are planned at $150 to $170
each. As with many looseleaf products, the cost of maintenance will soon
exceed the cost of the basic subscription.

While this work does provide access to many important documents, it does
not provide the analysis and narrative needed to place them in context. In
comparison, Ralph Folsom's European Union Business Law, published by West,
includes both a volume of narrative analysis and a volume of source
material. Although not completely duplicating the European Union Law Guide,
the West product provides a similar breadth of source material along with
an index of authorities and subject index at a cheaper price.

This guide is useful for firm or academic institutions that need a
collection of Union documentation but do not have access to a collection of
the Union's Official Journal. For those with access to the Official
Journal, this is an expensive compilation of material already available.

TAXATION --
OnPoint System: All States Tax Guide

RIA Group. CD-ROM. $400.

A question that recently appeared on the Internet is worth repeating here.
If vendors cancel their print products, forcing subscribers to purchase the
CD-ROMs, was the paper product of any value in the first place? During the
past 24 months I can recall this happening with the BNA Environmental
Reporter, the CCH Health Care Facilities Manual, and the RIA All States Tax
Guide. I have no answer to the question.

In either format, the RIA State and Local Taxes is a valuable resource
investment. In its CD-ROM format, OnPoint System: All States Tax Guide is
easy to use because of the Folio software. A one-year subscription can be
purchased as an option within the State and Local Tax Service of OnPoint
System for $375.

I reviewed this CD-ROM in the DOS format, which requires the use of the tab
key to navigate between the link tokens. The opening screen is divided into
51 states (including the District of Columbia), the Spidell California Tax
Letter, State and Local Taxes Weekly, What's New, User Support, and a
Catalog. For currency in state and local tax information, the What's New
section does a superb job. This screen is divided into three columns: the
link token to get to the full-text; the state and date; and a one-line
description.

The heart of the information, state and local taxes, is further divided
into 12 areas: corporate income, property, estate-gift, fuel and mineral,
general provisions, initial, sales use, licenses and other taxes, public
utilities, special local, chart-calendar, and search all. I found each of
these sections to be informative and easy to navigate.

While I found this product extremely useful and easy to use, I was somewhat
disappointed by the amount of information provided. Specifically--and this
is offered as a suggestion for improvement--I wanted to see state
Department of Revenue rulings in full-text.

Back to the Internet question: I wonder if products like this will have a
future if states begin to offer full-text documents on the Internet. As
with any CD-ROM product, librarians need to do a full cost-benefit analysis
to determine whether online or CD-ROM formats would provide maximum benefit
for the least cost. We determined that CD-ROM meets our needs and will
stretch our budget.

I recommend OnPoint System: All States Tax Guide to those firms whose
practices warrant having this information in this format. It also is an
ideal CD-ROM product for law schools.

AMERICAN LAWYER INTRODUCES VIDEO SUPPLEMENT

"American Lawyer" magazine, published by American Lawyer
Media (New York), has begun the production of "Video Trial
Report" with the March issue. "Video Trial Report" is a
special video supplement to be released with each issue of
the magazine.

Published ten times a year, "American Lawyer" has a paid
circulation of 17,700. It is targeted to and edited for
lawyers practicing in large law firms and corporate
counsel.

Each issue of the video supplement will examine what the
company calls "trial lawyering." American Lawyer said that
the video is designed as a companion to the magazine and
will contain the critical arguments and testimony discussed
in the feature article of the magazine. The videotape will
contain clips from coverage of "Court TV", a cable venture
started last year by a partnership between American Media,
Time Warner, NBC, Cablevision and Liberty Media Corp.

The first supplement contains coverage of a double-murder
trial in Dubuque (Iowa) through clips of the trial and
additional "expert" commentary from trial lawyers. The
April issue contains clips and commentary of the William
Kennedy Smith trial. American Lawyer Media president Steven
Brill emphasized that the videotape was not meant to take
the place of the magazine. It is intended strictly as a
supplement to the publication's main article. "This is not
the video version of 'American Lawyer'", he said.

Brill said that each video issue cost between $30,000 and
$50,000 to produce and that he expects to sign up about
2000 subscribers in the first year. "American Lawyer"
readers and other interested parties can subscribe to the
video for $19.50 for each issue.

JOINT VENTURE LAUNCHES SERVICE FOR LEGAL AVIATION FIELD

"Aviation Daily", a newsletter published by McGraw-Hill,
Inc. (New York), and the Federal Bar Association
(Washington, D.C.) have begun the production of "AvLex", an
independent reporting service for the legal aviation
community and those organizations who need coverage of
legal actions affecting the field of aviation.

The new monthly loose-leaf service will provide "current
and comprehensive reporting" of major aviation decisions,
opinions and orders issued by U.S. governmental agencies.
Key legal documents will be indexed and an editorial board
of FBA attorneys will take "an active advisory role" in the
service, McGraw-Hill said.

McGraw-Hill also said that "AvLex" will index, digest and
provide full-text for FAA chief counsel interpretations,
FAA civil penalty decisions, DOT economic orders and NTSB
 accident/ investigation decisions.

"Aviation Daily" editor Edmund Pinto said that "attorneys
are not the only users who will benefit" from the new
service. He said that aviation organizations will "gain
insight into the government's philosophy on aviation
issues, and ('AvLex') will provide air carriers with
optional guidance."

PASHA WINS RULING DEALING WITH PHOTOCOPYING OF NEWSLETTERS

A U.S. District Court in Dallas has ruled that the
photocopying of a newsletter is illegal and has permanently
banned Enmark Gas Corp. (Dallas, TX), a gas distributor,
from cover-to-cover copying and facsimile transmission of
"Gas Daily", a newsletter published by Pasha Publications
(Arlington, VA).

The ruling is the first to clearly prohibit the complete
photocopying and in-house distribution of a subsription
newsletter. Although there have been similar suits in the
past, they have all been settled out of court, before
judicial rulings were given. Terms of the settlement were
not revealed, prohibiting disclosure of whether Enmark will
pay damages to Pasha.

The federal court said that the photocopying of the letter,
and its subsequent distribution to other Enmark employees
without the publisher's permission, blatantly infringed on
Pasha's copyright. The ruling came despite the fact that
the judge found that Enmark was unaware that its actions
were improper or illegal. In explaining the ruling, the
court said that the copying of the letter "had an obvious
detrimental effect on the potential (subscription) market"
for the newsletter.

Under the federal copyright law's fair use doctrine,
photocopying of publications is legal for research and
non-commercial use. Newsletter publishers have argued for
some time that some subscribers have taken advantage of
that doctrine to distribute full text copies of newsletters
to their employees, thereby reducing the number of
potential subscribers. Some newsletter publishers offer
rewards to subscribers who identify illegal copiers.

PRICE COMM. SELLS INTEREST IN N.Y. LAW PUBLISHING; SEEKS TO
RESTRUCTURE DEBT

Price Communications (New York) has sold its majority
interest in New York Law Publishing Co. (New York) to
Apollo Investment Fund L.P. (New York) for $67.8 million,
with little cash involved. Apollo Investment is one of
Price's major debt holders. According to terms of the deal,
Apollo will assume about $48 million in Price bank debt and
will tender $19.2 million of debt it currently holds for
75% of face value.

New York Law Publishing publishes "National Law Journal"
and "New York Law Journal" magazines. Price purchased its
interest in the company in June 1985 for $20.5 million from
SFN Companies (Glenview, IL). NYLP publisher Jame
Finkelstein was "not available" for comment.

The sale comes as Price is attempting to reach a debt
agreement with a new restructuring plan. The company has
threatened to file bankruptcy if it cannot reach agreement
with creditors. The company has about $282 million in
subordinated debt. Under the plan, Price would convert
outstanding debt to 93% of its common equity. Agreement by
at least two-thirds of both its stock and debt holders is
needed for the plan to be implemented.

FEW FEMALE PARTNERS, SURVEY SAYS

A survey conducted by "Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly",

that female lawyers have gained few top positions at
leading law firms. Although the student body of most law
schools is "largely" female, the paper said, and females
account for 40% of the associates in the largest firms,
females make up only 10% of the partnerships. The paper
said that twenty of the 100 largest law firms in that state
had no female partners.

U.S. WINS MAJOR COURT VICTORY ON 'WILLFUL BLINDNESS'

 The seesaw case involving the 1989 sale of a home in Lake Norman,
North Carolina continues its rise through the federal courts.
Possible next stop: the U.S. Supreme Court. The issue: the limits
of money laundering prosecutions based on "willful blindness."

 The U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has given a major boost
to federal money laundering prosecutions in a case prosecuted by
Charlotte U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Ashcraft.

 It has fortified the legal notion that willful blindness, under
the right circumstances, can serve as a substitute for provable
actual knowledge on the part of the accused in a money laundering
case.

 According to the court, the case against Ellen Campbell, a young
North Carolina realtor, had the right stuff. In March 1991, she
became the first realtor in the country to be convicted of money
laundering. The jury found her guilty under the two federal money
laundering criminal laws (Title 18, USC Secs. 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and
1957).

 Later that year, federal district Judge Graham C. Mullen
overturned the jury's guilty verdict and acquitted Campbell based
on a post-trial motion by the defense (Money Laundering Alert,
November 1991).

 The evidence showed that she included unreported cash in the sale
of a home to a drug dealer, Mark Lawing. He drove flashy cars,
lived a carefree life and had expensive tastes. The government
presented no evidence that Campbell knew he was a drug dealer
(Money Laundering Alert, April 1991).

 Lawing bought the home at a price of $182,500. He signed a
contract to purchase, but his poor credit rating prevented him from
obtaining a mortgage. His parents secured a mortgage for $122,500,
and he told Campbell he would pay the sellers the balance "under
the table." She consented.

 That is the way the deal was done. At the closing Lawing arrived
at Campbell's real estate office carrying a paper bag containing
$60,000, which he turned over to the sellers. Campbell did not
include that sum in the closing statement. Afterwards, she accepted
a $200 gratuity from Lawing in addition to her portion of the
commission on the sale.

 Lawing had earlier pleaded guilty to federal money laundering and
drug charges. He helped the government by testifying against
Campbell.

 She took the witness stand at trial and testified that Lawing had
told her he owned a lucrative body shop. The jury concluded that
she knew the cash involved in the closing was "the proceeds of some
form of unlawful activity" and that she was "willfully blind" to
the facts surrounding Lawing and his money.

 In his instructions to the jury, Judge Mullen said:

- "(K)nowledge may be satisfied by inference drawn from proof that
(Campbell) deliberately closed her eyes to what would otherwise
have been obvious to her. A finding beyond a reasonable doubt of a
conscious purpose to avoid enlightenment would permit an inference
of knowledge...."

- "(That) does not authorize you to find that (Campbell) acted
knowingly because she should have known what was occurring ..., or
that (with) hindsight she should have known ... or because she was
negligent in failing to recognize what was occurring or even
because she was reckless or foolish in failing to recognize what
was occurring....(T)he government must prove ... that (Campbell)...
deliberately contrived to avoid learning all of the facts."

 In his post-trial ruling, the trial judge said that "in order for
a party other than the drug dealer to have an intent to conceal the
illegal source of the dealer's money, the party must first know the
dealer's occupation."

 The evidence was not enough for conviction, he added. What it
showed was that Lawing was "a spendthrift playboy" who testified he
never told Campbell his true occupation, the court said. "More than
just image must be shown," he wrote.

 The Fourth Circuit disagreed in an opinion dated September 28,
written by Chief Judge Sam Ervin III, son of his famous late
father, Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina.

 "The central issue ... is whether there was sufficient evidence
for the jury to find that Campbell possessed the knowledge that (1)
Lawing's funds were the proceeds of illegal activity, and (2) the
transaction was designed to disguise the nature of those proceeds,"
said the court.

 The court honed in on what it found to be the fatal trial court
error. The trial judge had told the jury that the government's
burden was to show "a purpose of concealment" and "knowledge of the
drug dealers activities" on the part of the accused.

 That misstates the government's burden, said the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals. "The government must only show that the defendant
possesses the knowledge that the transaction was designed to
conceal illegal proceeds," said the court.

 It is a critical decision where the "defendant is a person other
than the individual who is the source of the tainted money," it
said.

 What really matters in cases like Campbell's is not her
motivation. That is "irrelevant," said the court.

 Her motive "without question," the court said, was to close the
deal and collect her commission "without regard to the source of
the money" or the sale's effect "in concealing a portion of the
purchase price."

 The money laundering law only requires the U.S. to show that
Campbell knew "the property involved in a financial transaction
represents the proceeds of some form of illegal activity," the
court said.

 The money laundering law requires that the transaction to be
"designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise the
nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of
the proceeds of specified unlawful activity" (Title 18, USC Sec.
1956(a)(1)(B)).

 "The omission of $60,000 from all documentation regarding the
sales price ... clearly satisfies this standard -- concealing both
the nature and the location of Lawing's illegally derived funds,"
the court asserted in a footnote.

 The "knowledge component" of the money laundering law boils down
to a single inquiry, said the court: "Did Campbell know that
Lawing's funds were derived from an illegal source?"

 The trial court should have left that question to the jury to
decide, said the appellate panel.

 It was correct for the trial court to exclude evidence that Lawing
was a "known" drug dealer, but it incorrectly underrated the
importance of Campbell's realtor colleague who testified that
Campbell had told her the cash "may have been drug money."

 By discounting that testimony because it conflicted with the
colleague's prior grand jury statements, the trial court improperly
invaded the exclusive province of the jury. "It should have been
left to the jury to decide," said the court. Lawing's lifestyle was
not irrelevant, either, the court pointed out.

 All those factors were "sufficient to create a question for the
deliberately closed her eyes to
what would otherwise have been obvious to her,'" the court
reasoned.

 A "reasonable jury" could have easily found Campbell guilty on
those facts, concluded the court. It reversed the judgment of
acquittal entered by the trial judge. Under the rules by which the
issues were heard, Campbell will now get a new trial (U.S. v.
Campbell, Case No. 91-5695, 4th Cir. Ct. App).

JUSTICE ISSUES LAUNDERING GUIDELINES

 For the first time in the six-year history of the federal money
laundering law, which carries some of the heaviest penalties in the
U.S. Code, the nation's 94 U.S. Attorneys will have central
guidelines to follow when they seek to prosecute certain defendants
for laundering.

 The Justice Department, saying it wanted "to ensure consistency in
certain type of prosecutions" in an area of the law that "is
developing very fast," issued new rules of the game for money
laundering prosecutions. They cover prosecutions under the
forfeiture laws (Title 18, USC Secs. 1956 and 1957 and Title 18,
USC Secs. 981 and 982).

 "We must use these powerful tools carefully," say the Department's
new guidelines. In addition to receiving central clearance on
certain money laundering prosecutions, the nation's federal
prosecutors will now also be required to report key statistics on
their use of the laundering laws to Justice.

 The guidelines require the prior approval of the Department in
four categories of cases:

- where a case is based "solely" on the extraterritorial reach of
the money laundering laws

- where the sole purpose of the subject financial transaction was
to evade taxes

- where the financial transaction involves attorney's fees and an
attorney is sought to be prosecuted

- where a financial institution, as defined in the BSA regulations,
is to be named as a defendant or as an unindicted co-conspirator
(31 CFR 103.11).

 The money laundering section of the Criminal Division will serve
as the focal point for the approval process. Federal prosecutors
are required to send copies of the proposed indictment along with
a "prosecutive memorandum."

 The definition of "financial institution" used in the guidelines
does not include many businesses defined as such by the BSA, such
car dealers, jewelers, real estate agents, and insurance companies.

 The guidelines explicitly state they do not apply to non-bank
financial institutions, such as check cashers or currency exchange
houses which are not branches of a larger institution.

 The new rules apply only to prosecutions under the money
laundering laws. They do not apply to those for failure to file or
the fraudulent filing of currency transaction reports under the
Bank Secrecy Act.

 And, they have no effect on BSA prosecutions and forfeitures for
structuring (Title 31, USC Secs. 5324) or on civil forfeitures
linked to money laundering cases (Title 18, USC Sec. 981).

 In addition to the cases requiring Washington approval before they
can be filed, the guidelines also require federal prosecutors to
seek "consultation" with the money laundering section in these
cases:

- where they seek forfeiture of a business on the theory that it
facilitated money laundering

- where a civil penalty is sought to be imposed under the money
laundering laws as part of a criminal prosecution for laundering
(Title 18, USC Sec. 1956(b))

- where the "specified unlawful activity" alleged in a laundering
charge is a financial or fraud crime "so closely connected" that
there is "no clear delineation" between that crime and the money
laundering offense.

 The Department warns prosecutors that where the same financial
transaction is the basis for the specified unlawful activity and
the laundering charge, no money laundering charge should be
brought.

 The guidelines were issued by Assistant Attorney for the Criminal
Division Robert S. Mueller. They are called "bluesheets" and will
be contained in the U.S. Attorneys' Manual (USAM 9-105.000).

 Hardly any area of federal jurisprudence is presently as dynamic
and volatile as the money laundering field. The new prosecution
guidelines were long in coming. They are not binding. If a
prosecutor does not comply with them, the defendant cannot
complain.

 The major criticism of the guidelines will focus on the topics
they do not address. But, they are a beginning toward bringing
uniformity to an important area of the law previously molded by 94
distinct points of view.

WORLD'S SECURITIES REGULATORS MAP LAUNDERING STRATEGY

 A sleeping potential giant in the world money laundering effort
has begun to awake. At its annual meeting in London last month, the
International Organization of Securities Commissions revealed the
results of the work of a working committee on money laundering.

 That is a unit formed by IOSCO to analyze the impact of money
laundering on the securities and futures industries and to
recommend ways to deal with it.

 Recognizing that other financial sectors, notably banking, have
increased their defenses against money laundering, IOSCO said it is
important to "ensure that securities and futures markets do not
become a comparatively more attractive alternative for money
launderers."

 The difficulty in dealing with laundering in the securities field
is that, usually, little currency is involved in the transactions
which are commonplace in the industry. It is an industry that runs
by computer blips and paper. Its exposure to money laundering comes
after the launderers have disposed of their cash through other
means.

 The IOSCO report is the first treatment of the money laundering
problem by the world's securities commissioners. IOSCO was formed
in 1986. It is the only global association of governmental bodies
which regulate the securities and futures markets. The Montreal-
based organization has 101 members from 63 countries.

 In its year-long study, the IOSCO committee worked closely with
the Financial Action Task Force, an organization formed in 1989 by
the Group of Seven major industrialized nations which now has 28
member countries.

 In 1990, the FATF issued 40 recommendations representing a global
blueprint for dealing with money laundering. They have become the
guideposts for action by countries and regional bodies around the
world (Money Laundering Alert, May 1990).

 The IOSCO working group said its objectives are to act as a
clearinghouse for information for securities and futures regulators
on money laundering and to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on
legitimate businesses while preventing illicit proceeds from
entering the markets.

 The IOSCO report said money laundering can occur in the securities
industry in customer accounts which are used only to hold funds and
not for trading. In those cases, banking channels with more
stringent money laundering controls are skirted.

 Other indications of money laundering are what are known as "wash
trading" transactions. Those involve the entry of matching buys and
sells in particular securities which create the illusion of
trading. Wash trading through multiple accounts generating
offsetting profits and losses and transfers of positions between
accounts that do not appear to be commonly controlled are other
indicators of money laundering.

 The report makes seven recommendations to the securities industry:

- Customer identification procedures should prohibit anonymous
accounts or those in names that clearly appear fictitious and
should require that the identity of new customers be verified.

- Recordkeeping requirements should aim to verify the movement of
funds in securities transactions and document them fully. Records
should be kept for least five years.

- Detection and reporting of suspicious transactions, particularly
where complex and unusual transactions and strange trading patterns
exist, should be an industry standard.

- To prevent control of securities firms by criminal elements, due
diligence procedures should be used to examine the principals of
trading firms. There should be a free exchange of public and non-
public information through international sharing agreements.

- Model compliance and audit programs to guard against money
laundering should be established in all securities and futures
firms.

- The use of cash and its equivalents should be discouraged. That
includes transferrable bearer shares or debt instruments.

- Securities regulators should cooperate with law enforcement
agencies resulting in the free and prompt exchange of information.

 If recognition of a problem is the first step toward its cure,
IOSCO has begun the process of confronting the money laundering
problem that no one denies exists in the gigantic securities and
futures industries. Now begins the task of implemention.

WHISTLEBLOWER GETS $13 MILLION IN GE LAUNDRING CASE

 Crime doesn't pay, the saying goes, but exposing crime in the U.S.
these days can pay handsomely. Ask Chester L. Walsh. He is now
richer by $13.4 million for having blown the whistle on his former
employer, the General Electric Company, which earlier this year was
found guilty of a multi-million dollar corruption scheme.

 Walsh, a GE employee for 25 years, smuggled documents out of
Israel which helped prove that Rami Dotan, an Israeli Air Force
General, received about $11 million in payoffs from GE for his help
in assuring that GE kept lucrative F-16 aircraft sales contracts
with Israel. The contracts were financed largely with U.S. funds
(Money Laundering Alert, August 1992).

 Walsh was manager of the company's Israel aircraft sales
operations for four years. In 1987, certain events made him
suspicious. He began noting and recording conversations with GE
employees who were involved in the corrupt scheme. He also hired a
California lawyer.

 Walsh received the largest sum ever paid to a whistleblower. He
filed what is known as a qui tam proceeding. He, with the aid of a
California group called Taxpayers Against Fraud, sued the
government in November 1990 under the False Claims Act, the so-
called "whistleblower statute."

 That law dates back to 1863 and permits individuals to file suit
in federal court alleging fraud against the government. It also
permits a whistleblower to receive up to 25% of the amount
recovered by the government in civil damages. Walsh received 22.5%
(Title 31, USC Sec. 3730(b)(1)).

 Walsh's attorney, John Phillips, says the case is a "total slap in
the face to GE and the Justice Department." They had argued that
Walsh did not deserve payment because he had purposely delayed
reporting the wrongdoing in order to increase his potential award.

 GE says that if Walsh had "dealt honestly" with the company, the
fraud could have been detected and reported much earlier and could
have saved the government millions of dollars.

 In his ruling, Cincinnati federal Judge Carl B. Rubin said the
opposite was true and that the government would in fact make a
"profit" of at least $4 million.

 Phillips described GE's claims as "absurd." He said his client had
to maintain silence in order to protect himself and that the
treatment of whistleblowers by GE gave Walsh reason to fear for his
job and personal safety.

 "This is not the type of suit you file lightly," Phillips said.
"You must have full evidence."

 While working in Israel, Walsh had gone to another GE employee
with his concerns. When too many questions were raised, that
employee was transferred out of the country.

 Judge Rubin concluded that without Walsh it would have been
"difficult, if not impossible" to sustain a case against GE. He
also said that Walsh's actions as an individual were not important
and that the important issue is the concept of whistleblowers.

 "No one likes snitches, but they can be valuable," Rubin said.
"This is not the first case where this Court has noted the
antagonism of the Justice Department to a whistleblower. The reason
continues to be unknown, but the attitude is clear."

 Walsh recently described the court ruling as "the end of a long
and stressful five years."  Now retired in Florida, he plans to
give half the award to Taxpayers Against Fraud which assists
claimants under the whistleblower statute (Case Nos. CR 1-92-87 and
Civ. C-1-90-792, So. Dis. Oh.).

BUSH TAX VETO WEAKENS CID MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORT

 The day after the November 3rd election, President Bush vetoed a
$27 billion tax bill partly in deference to his campaign promise of
"no new taxes." While his action spared some U.S. taxpayers of a
larger tax bite, it also grievously hurt the capabilities of the
IRS's Criminal Investigation Division in the money laundering
effort.

 The CID is a key player in that effort. Its ability to develop
cases through artful undercover investigations gains the admiration
of most. Undercover investigations usually require start-up money.
With any luck, profits from doing business with the bad guys,
undercover, pay or defray the government's costs.

 It is a bonanza for the taxpayer: the bad guys supply the cash
which fuels the mechanism designed to cause their demise. They pay
for their own indictment. Sometimes they supply enough cash, in
commissions charged by the federal agents posing as money
launderers, to support the next undercover job.

 All major federal investigative agencies, except the CID, have
standing authority to "churn" those profits. That means they can
plow the profits back into the operation or use them for another
undercover job without having to dip into their agency's budget.

 In the case of the CID, the budget is controlled at the local
level by the IRS District Directors who are not attached to the CID
and who usually have no law enforcement experience.

 If the CID cannot churn the profits, they have to be put into the
general treasury of the U.S., probably never to be seen again for
law enforcement purposes. Instead, the CID must seek funds from the
budget allocated annually to each of the 63 IRS districts.

 Churning undercover profits, federal agents say, is a good
investment because it spares the taxpayer of having to fund much of
the effort against the criminals in society. Moreover, they say,
undercover operations that don't have to beg, borrow, and steal, in
order to function, will reap much greater rewards for the taxpayer.

 Why? Because a more credible undercover facade lands bigger fish
and locates more assets the government can later seize.

 The veto by President Bush terminated the CID's ability to churn
its undercover profits. They are not insignificant, ranging to 2,
4, or 6 percent of the dirty money which the undercover agents
"launder" for the criminals.

 The result of the veto: CID undercover operations will be scaled
back, and the profits which criminals unwittingly pay to government
agents go into the "black hole" of the general treasury.

 The other CID tool which was emasculated by the veto was the IRS
ability to freely disseminate data from IRS Form 8300 to other
federal agencies. That form reports cash receipts of more than
$10,000 received by trades and businesses, such as car and boat
dealers, realtors, lawyers and other businesses. It can provide
missing pieces to a financial jigsaw puzzle agents are grappling
with.

 Because it is authorized by the tax code and thus considered a tax
return, Form 8300 is treated differently than IRS Form 4789, which
is authorized by the Bank Secrecy Act (Title 26, USC Sec. 6050I and
Title 31, USC Sec. 5313).

 The inability to share freely the data from Form 8300 creates an
uneven playing field for the government and strips away the logic
of the federal cash reporting regimen. Ideally, cash paid to a
trade or business is reported on Form 8300 and subsequently
reported on Form 4789 which is filed by the financial institution
where the business banks. That provides a paper trail for cash
which is otherwise untraceable. It helps agencies, such as the FBI,
the Customs Service, and the DEA, follow that cash flow. Presently
they can't.

 Until the new Congress, which convenes next month, acts to remedy
those problems, the CID will operate with one hand tied behind its
back.

MISSING CTRS COST BANK $65,000 PENALTY

 The Treasury Department announced this month that it imposed a
$65,000 civil penalty under the Bank Secrecy Act against a small
Arizona bank for failure to file IRS Form 4789, the Currency
Transaction Report, on several occasions. It is the fifth, and
possibly final, BSA penalty in 1992.

 Caliber Bank, based in Phoenix, committed the violations during
the period from November 1989 to February 1992. They were
discovered when BankAmerica Corporation, which owns Caliber,
performed an internal compliance audit of the bank.

 Neither Treasury nor Caliber Bank officials responded to questions
about the number of CTR violations that were discovered. Treasury
said it took into account the bank's voluntary disclosure of the
infractions in assessing the penalty.

 Treasury said another factor that mitigated the penalty was the
improvement in the bank's compliance programs instituted by the new
management.

 The BSA requires financial institutions to file Form 4789 when a
cash transaction of more than $10,000 is conducted by a customer.
The forms assist the government in tracking money laundering, tax
evasion and other criminal activities (Title 31, USC Sec. 5313).

 Treasury's Office of Financial Enforcement has been criticized
severely this year by the House Ways and Means Oversight
Subcommittee and the General Accounting Office for its slow penalty
process (Money Laundering Alert, April and July 1992). Of the five
civil penalties this year, two have been levied in the past three
months.

 Founded in April 1985, Caliber Bank has gone through many changes
in its short history. It was created by Valley Capital Corporation,
which is Nevada-based. Last spring, Caliber was acquired by
BankAmerica Corporation. Since then, Caliber has grown from nine
branches to 40.

 BankAmerica has agreed to sell the forty Caliber branches to a
California investment group named Independent Bancorp in which
Peter Ueberroth, the former major league baseball commissioner, and
Anthony M. Frank, former Postmaster General, are principals. The
application for the merger is pending with the Federal Reserve
Board.

 The Caliber BSA violations occurred under prior management. No
criminal charges were brought against the bank or its employees.

FED IMPOSES $200,000 CIVIL PENALTY ON PAKISTANI BANK

 Last February, large advertisements in several major newspapers,
placed by the State Bank of Pakistan, offered "bearer certificates
in foreign currency" under conditions of total secrecy. The ad said
there would be "no questions asked about source of funds!" and no
identity would be disclosed.

 The Pakistani offering was short-lived. Five days after the ads
appeared, the bank, which is the country's central bank, canceled
the sale of the bonds in the U.S. and postponed sales elsewhere
after several U.S. officials expressed shock at the brazen money
laundering solicitation.

 In March, by letter responding to questions from Senator John
Kerry (D. Mass.), Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said the Fed had sent examiners to three Pakistani-owned banks
operating in the U.S., the National Bank of Pakistan, Habib Bank
and United Bank.

 Greenspan said the U.S. had received assurances from the banks
that the bearer certificates would not be issued in the U.S. He
said the Fed had consulted with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to determine compliance with U.S. securities laws. He
said the Fed was continuing to "evaluate the implications of the
advertisement and the information it contains."

 The results of the Federal Reserve's examination of the three
Pakistani banks are now known. On September 28, the Fed announced
a comprehensive cease and desist order directed at the Chicago
branch of the National Bank of Pakistan.

 The Fed also imposed a $200,000 civil penalty against the bank for
its failure to comply with various recordkeeping and reporting
provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act. Details of those violations
were not disclosed.

 The cease and desist order requires the bank to undertake a number
of "affirmative actions" to assure compliance with the BSA. Prior
to the order, the bank was required to submit to the Fed, the FDIC,
and the Illinois banking commissioner a detailed BSA compliance
program designed to ensure that the Chicago branch of the bank
complies with "all the provisions of the BSA."

 The Chicago branch was put on notice that it must exercise special
care to control and monitor "the flow of funds to and from the
(branch) to persons and entities" in and out of the U.S. An
innovative aspect of the order mandates the creation by the branch
of a "know your customer" policy with the ability to:

- identify and confirm the identity of each customer

- "predict with relative certainty the types of transactions that
each of the customers ... is likely to transact"

- monitor customer transactions to see if they are "inconsistent
with the customer's regular and ordinary practices"

- investigate and, where necessary, prohibit transactions where
customer identity cannot be confirmed or where a transaction is
inconsistent with the customer's "normal practices and no
satisfactory explanation exists."

 The Fed's order also prohibits two unnamed employees of the
Chicago branch from any duties involving cash transactions or BSA
compliance and requires the employment of an individual, acceptable
to federal authorities, to supervise BSA compliance.

 The bank will be obligated to furnish quarterly reports to the Fed
and the FDIC detailing compliance with the terms of the cease and
desist order.

 The Pakistani-owned bank may not be finished with all of its
regulatory problems. The Fed's order says other federal or state
agencies are not prevented from taking any other action which they
deem appropriate.

CONGRESS INVITES PUBLIC HELP WITH CASH REWARDS

 Congress thought of most things that could assist the federal
effort when it passed the comprehensive new money laundering law
which took effect on October 29.

 On the theory that tongues are loosened with incentives of cash
rewards, Congress authorized the Justice Department to pay "awards
for information or assistance directly relating to violation" of
the money laundering, cash reporting, and structuring laws.

 Under the new law, Justice is permitted to pay such awards from
its bulging Asset Forfeiture Fund. Previously, it was permitted to
pay awards from the fund only in matters that pertain to violations
of the "criminal drug laws of the U.S." (Title 28, USC Sec.
524(c)(1)(B)).

 The new award for public assistance is not the first in the money
laundering field. The Bank Secrecy Act contains a provision giving
the Treasury Department authority to "pay a reward to an individual
who provides original information" leading to a criminal fine,
civil penalty, or forfeiture of more than $50,000, connected to a
BSA violation.

 That reward cannot exceed 25 percent of the government's recovery,
or $150,000, "whichever is less."  Since the enactment of that
provision, no reward is believed to have been paid. It is not known
who, if anyone, has applied (Title 31, USC Secs. 5323).

TREASURY NOW HAS ITS OWN FORFEITURE FUND

 There has always been a rivalry between the law enforcement
agencies of the Treasury Department (IRS, Customs Service and
Secret Service) and those in the Justice Department (FBI and DEA).
The turf and resources battles are often fought behind closed doors
in Washington, but sometimes they spill out and affect the
performance of the agencies in the field.

 Neither side likes to be outgunned by the other. If one gets a new
widget, the other says it cannot function without it. The result,
in some cases, is duplication of resources often running into the
tens of millions of dollars.

 The latest example may be the recent creation by Congress of a
Treasury Department Forfeiture Fund which will mirror the
forfeiture fund already operating in the Justice Department. Each
fund will contain the property, including cash, forfeited by
constituent agencies of each department. The Justice Forfeiture
Fund, now about six years old, administers more than $1 billion in
forfeited property at any given time.

 The Treasury Forfeiture Fund was created as part of the recently
enacted Treasury Department appropriations bill (H.R.5488). The law
permits Treasury to utilize the fund for a variety of purposes
including the hiring of outside contractors to administer forfeited
properties, payment of mortgages and liens on the property,
"equitable sharing" payments to state and local enforcement
agencies and foreign governments which assist in Treasury cases,
payment of awards for assistance in Treasury forfeitures, and
purchase of evidence used in money laundering cases and forfeiture
actions.

 The U.S. now has two principal forfeiture funds containing more
money than the annual budgets of several states. How wisely they
are administered will be on the agenda of the new administration.

U.S. DOLLARS MOTIVATE STATES TO JOIN LAUNDERING EFFORT

 Recognizing that money laundering can be fought by federal and
state combatants shoulder-to-shoulder compatibly, the federal
government is offering $600,000 in grants to state Attorneys
General and local prosecutors to beef up their effort.

 The available grants were announced on November 9 in the Federal
Register, the official repository of all federal offerings and
notices (57 Fed. Reg. 217, p. 53352).

 A "statewide prosecutorial authority" to deal with money
laundering and other financial crimes is what the grants seek to
foment. There are some strings attached. They will be issued by the
Bureau of Justice Assistance, an element of the Justice Department.

 The announcement says an eligible grantee must be in a state that
has:

- a money laundering statute

- a "financial reporting statute" similar to the Bank Secrecy Act
(Title 31, USC Secs. 5311-5328)

- a reporting statute for "non-bank financial institutions,"
especially where "currency exchange businesses" border on Mexico or
Canada.

 To further cement ties to the federal effort, the grant says the
prevailing parties must be in a state that has signed a "memorandum
of understanding" with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
All but ne of the states have already done so.

 FinCEN, which is housed in the Treasury Department, receives and
analyzes millions of pieces of data contained in the various forms
the public at large is required to file with the government.

 If a state does not quite have the indicated laws and agreements,
the grant announcement says a saving grace will be the present
consideration of such reforms by the state legislature.

 Eligible state legal offices will improve their chances for the
federal grants if they reside in states which:

- have statewide grand jury laws

- use "post-seizure analysis teams" in their offices

- are the "designated FinCEN coordinator for the state."

 A vow to cooperate with the FinCEN coordinator is required of
those who do not hold that title.

 Several states are preparing their constituent agencies to apply
for the grants. Some, such as Texas, are considering legislation
that would meet the grant conditions. Others, such as Illinois,
have recently met the standards in large measure.

 Spawning a flock of states to do effective battle in the money
laundering war may create innovations and will increase the number
of public officials making requests for the books and records of
financial institutions.

 The formal grant announcement of the Bureau of Justice Assistance
will be available, it is expected, in the middle of January. There
will be 120 days to file grant requests. The winners will probably
be selected 30 days later. As many as 20 applications are expected.

CARRIBBEAN STATES MEET, ISSUE LAUNDERING DECLARATION

 In many nations the pace of legislative and regulatory activity on
money laundering has quickened. One reason: the imminent deadline
within the European Community for implementing the EC's money
laundering directive.

 Legislative bodies throughout the continent are exploring laws to
comply with the terms of the directive (Money Laundering Alert, May
1991). The Cortes in Spain and Germany's Bundestag are two
examples.

 Here are some important developments.

With prodding from big nations, Caribbean nations say they will
step up effort

 No global solution to the world's money laundering problem is
possible without the active participation of the Caribbean nations.
Everyone knows that. Many of them are premier laundering centers.

 Their proximity to the world's largest cocaine producers and
exporters, in South America's Andean region, and the largest
generator of drug dollars, the U.S., makes the region a convenient
bank for many international criminals, including drug dealers.

 That is why five large nations, who are involved in their own
money laundering control efforts, spearheaded a gathering last
month in Jamaica of 17 Caribbean nations. The U.S., U.K., France,
Canada, and the Netherlands were the catalysts.

 The two-day meeting started November 5 in Kingston some 29 months
after an initial Caribbean meeting in Aruba June 1990.

 At the conclusion, the nations issued a "Kingston Declaration on
Money Laundering." The Declaration expressed solidarity with the
1988 United Nations Convention on Illicit Trafficking on Narcotic
Drugs which has money laundering provisions. Not all Caribbean
nations have yet ratified it.

 The declaration also agreed to implement the 40 recommendations
issued by the G-7 FATF in 1990 and the 19 additional ones issued at
the 1990 Aruba meeting (Money Laundering Alert, August 1990).

 The declaration also accepted the offer of Trinidad and Tobago to
host next year's meeting and to provide facilities for a
secretariat of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force.

 The secretariat will be led by a steering group comprised of CFATF
members and the larger nations. The steering group will have
representatives from each group of Caribbean nations such as the
Dutch and Spanish language member nations.

 The secretariat will coordinate self-assessment procedures, help
evaluate members' progress, act as a clearing house for training
and technical assistance, and serve as liaison with non-member
countries and international organizations. It will report annually.

 The declaration recommended laws:

- defining money laundering based on the model laws issued by the
Organization of American States last May (Money Laundering Alert,
June 1992)

- concerning the seizure and forfeiture of drug proceeds and linked
assets. They should enable the identification, tracing and
evaluation of property subject to seizure, and permit freezing
orders.

- allowing judicial challenges to seizure orders by an
administrative body

- permitting forfeiture in all cases following conviction

- permitting courts to decide that "all property obtained during a
prescribed period of time by a person convicted of drug trafficking
has been derived from such criminal activity."

 The Caribbean nations also agreed to enter into mutual assistance
agreements with each other to assist in money laundering cases.

 They also agreed that money laundering should be an extraditable
offense subject to simplified procedures and that forfeited assets
should be shared among cooperating nations.

 The declaration's terms would:

- permit continuation of numbered accounts at financial
institutions with the understanding that account information would
be made available to "competent authorities" upon request and
insist on strong legal requirements on customer identification

- insist that in large currency transactions, customer
identification procedures and recordkeeping are "mandatory"

- amend bank secrecy laws to allow the reporting of suspicious
transactions by financial institutions, but make it optional
whether a statute is required

 The Caribbean money laundering effort seems to react only to the
prodding of the larger nations. If the gathering in Kingston does
not produce results, the money laundering control efforts of the
larger nations will be for naught.

Bank of England expresses worry of use of wire transfers as
laundering tools

 A very active player in the world money laundering control effort,
the Bank of England last month voiced concern about the
susceptibility of international funds payments systems to money
laundering.

 "The increasing efficiency and integration of the world's
financial system creates an environment that organized criminals
are only too ready to exploit," said the British central bank in
its Quarterly Bulletin.

 U.K. bankers are taking their suspicious transaction reporting
duties seriously. About 12,000 such reports will be filed this year
compared to 4,087 last year. Yet, only two financial institution
employees have been prosecuted under the nation's money laundering
law.

 The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telcommunications,
a major clearing system known as SWIFT, has told its users to
include the names and addresses of senders and recipients of
electronic funds transfers.

 In London in late October, the government proposed legislation
that would greatly expand the reach of the nation's present money
laundering law. If the proposed law is enacted, money laundering
from all offenses, not just drug trafficking, will be subject to
criminal charges.

 The proposed law will also facilitate forfeiture of a drug
trafficker's assets. A greater danger awaits those in financial
institutions who do not report suspicious transactions. Suspicious
transaction reporting is the heart of the British money laundering
control system. Penalties will be greater and prosecution will be
facilitated against those who do not report those situations.

TREASURY ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS UNDER BSA IMMINENT

 Here are some recent developments:

Treasury expected to issue two Administrative Rulings

- Two long-awaited Administrative Rulings from the Treasury
Department on certain fine points of Bank Secrecy Act compliance
are expected before the change of administrations in January.

 One deals with the relaxed identification rules applicable to
elderly customers. The other is expected to deal with the treatment
of multiple transactions on IRS Form 4789, the Currency Transaction
Report. The form asks in Line 3(d) to indicate whether a "multiple
transaction" was the reason the identification details about the
person "who conducted this transaction" are not stated on the form.

 Treasury's Administrative Rulings are a means by which affected
financial institutions are guided on BSA compliance questions. They
have been nonexistent in the last few years. From the date of the
first one on June 22, 1988 to the eighth one on December 21, 1989,
less than 18 months passed. In the intervening 36 months, Treasury
has issued none.

 In addition to Administrative Rulings, Treasury also provides
guidance to inquiring institutions through "private rulings," which
are written responses by the Office of Financial Enforcement.

 The letters explain appropriate conduct under the BSA or construe
its provisions. The private rulings flow from Treasury in a steady,
albeit slow, stream to institutions across the country. Inquiries
can be directed to: Office of Financial Enforcement, U.S. Treasury
Department, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, DC 20202.
(CHECK) Its telephone number is (202) 622-0400.

Santa Claus robber can help himself by proving his money laundering

 The money laundering issue appears to be one for all seasons.
Jeffrey Stenner, a Connecticut restauranteur, dressed up as Santa
Claus on December 20, 1988 and robbed an armored truck of more than
$695,000 while it was making its rounds at a bank. He pleaded
guilty to that charge and the government agreed to drop another
armored truck robbery charge involving the theft of $1.1 million.

 Federal district Judge Alan H. Nevas does not believe Stenner's
story that all the money was spent and that no cash hoard awaits
him after he completes the sentence the judge is about to impose.

 The U.S. Probation Office has suggested to the judge that the
sentence be increased from the term indicated by the federal
sentencing guidelines (78 to 97 months) if Stenner has hidden part
of his loot.

 "I am convinced that there is a cash hoard out there that awaits
Mr. Stenner when he is released from jail....He'd be out in seven
years....That's a nice tidy sum to support him for the rest of his
life," said the judge at the sentencing hearing last month.

 The solution: See if Stenner can prove how he laundered and spent
the $1.7 million he stole. IRS agents working the case cannot
account for nearly a million dollars of the total.

 Judge Nevas rescheduled the sentencing until later this month to
see if Stenner was an artful money launderer. If so, his sentence
may be less than what the judge is inclined to impose.

TX JURY ORDERS HOUSTON LAW FIRM TO PAY $21.7M IN DAMAGES

     A Harris County, TX, jury on Aug. 15 awarded $21.7 million
in damages to the estate of a Houston oilman against the Houston
law firm of Vinson & Elkins on claims that the firm's gross
negligence generated millions of dollars in unnecessary
attorneys' fees and resulted in a $40 million loss of investment
income to the family (Moran et al. v. Vinson & Elkins, Harris
Cty., TX, Dist. Ct., No. 90-24849).

     The award consisted of $17.7 million in actual damages,
$1 million in punitive damages and $3 million in special damages.
The jury concluded that the firm had engaged in gross negligence;
breach of fiduciary duty for its own gain; civil conspiracy;
"false, misleading or deceptive acts"; and knowingly
"unconscionable action" in handling the estate.

     According to the complaint, William Moran died in November
1983, leaving an estate estimated to be worth $80 million, and
Vinson & Elkins (V&E) undertook representation of the estate
after another firm was forced to withdraw.  In addition to
representing the estate itself, V&E also represented the various
Moran companies, which were primarily in the oil and gas
business.

     The plaintiffs say that, from the beginning of V&E's
representation of the estate, the firm concealed a number of
conflicts of interest, including the fact that its managing
partner was a director and trust committee member of First City
Bancorporation of Texas, and that many V&E attorneys owned stock
in the bank.  In addition, the firm concealed negative financial
information about the bank and conspired to prolong the
administration of the estate so that the bank and V&E could
"continue to exploit the estate for excessive executor's and
attorneys' fees and expenses," said the plaintiffs.

     Other examples of V&E's negligence, the plaintiffs said,
included improper tax advice; business ventures which cost the
estate substantial amounts of money because V&E had "numerous
financial, professional and personal ties" with the companies
involved in the deals; and failure to reveal that First City was
"engaging in self-dealing by manipulating the maintenance of
short-term, low interest investment of estate assets."
               In its answer, V&E responded that (1) the plaintiffs lack
standing to sue because they lacked privity of contract with V&E;
and (2) the causes of action included in the complaint are not
assignable.  The firm counterclaimed that the suit was brought
for the purpose of harassment.

     The plaintiffs were represented by Brodus Spivey and Thomas
Prehoditch of Spivey, Grigg, Kelly & Knisely in Austin.  Counsel
for V&E were Richard Caldwell and Laura Ware of Mayor, Day,
Caldwell & Keeton in Houston.

CH. 11 EXAMINER CRITICAL OF LAW FIRM'S LACK OF DISCLOSURE

     In a report unsealed at the end of August, bankruptcy court-
appointed examiner Charles Stillman criticized Leslie Fay
Companies counsel Weil Gotshal & Manges for not being
disinterested while representing the estate and for not making
proper disclosure of conflicts of interest as mandated by the
Bankruptcy Code (In re: The Leslie Fay Companies, Inc., et al.;
SD NY Bank., No. 93 B 41724 (TLB)).

     Stillman concluded that, because the conflict in this case
arose from the appearance of impropriety rather than from actual
conduct harming the estates, the bankruptcy court should consider
as a sanction a limited disallowance of the legal fees incurred
by the firm, based on the cost of the investigation.

     According to the report, which was originally filed under
seal on May 27, Weil Gotshal was retained by Leslie Fay in
February 1993 to assist with an investigation of certain
accounting irregularities in the company's general ledger.  After
substantial losses in income were revealed as a result of the
investigation, Leslie Fay was no longer able to obtain financing
arrangements to operate its businesses, and filed for Chapter 11
protection in April 1993.  The bankruptcy court authorized Weil
Gotshal's employment as counsel to the Leslie Fay debtors.

     The issue of Weil Gotshal's disinterestedness was first
raised when the firm filed its application for fees.  The
creditors' committee and the trustee objected to the fee request,
saying that there were questions about the firm's disclosure of
its relationships with various parties related to Leslie Fay.
Stillman was appointed in December 1993.

     Stillman said that the pre-petition audit committee-related
relationships of Weil Gotshal included representation of Bear
Stearns and Odyssey Partners, several of whose employees were
members of the Leslie Fay audit committee.  He describes Weil
Gotshal's professional relationships with Bear Stearns and
Odyssey as "significant."  The examiner also stated that, at the
time Weil Gotshal was appointed as bankruptcy counsel, its
regular computerized conflicts-check was not performed, as the
company had already been representing the company for several
months.

     With respect to Weil Gotshal's post-petition
representations, Stillman said that the firm represented a number
of Leslie Fay directors in a securities class-action lawsuit and
government investigations which followed revelation of the
accounting problems at the company.  He investigated assertions
that Weil Gotshal's "insistence" on resolving the securities
fraud claims against officers and directors, which, in turn,
implicated officers' and directors' indemnification claims
against Leslie Fay, inhibited a prompt reorganization plan.  He
concluded that there was no documentary evidence to support
claims that Weil Gotshal's position was designed to further the
individual officers' and directors' interests to the detriment of
the estate.

     In preparing his reports, Stillman relied upon the
bankruptcy code 327 standard for the employment of professionals,
which requires that such professionals hold no interest adverse
to the estate and be disinterested persons, not just at the
beginning of their employ, but throughout the period of
employment.  He noted the difficulty of interpreting what
constitutes "adverse interest," as the code does not define the
phrase.  In considering the code's underlying policies, the
examiner said that counsel for the debtor need not always be
"perfectly disinterested": the test is one of materiality --
whether the firm had a material adverse interest.

     Turning to the judicial definition of "adverse interest" in
the context of multiple representations, Stillman reviewed
rulings of the First, Third and 10th Circuit Courts of Appeal, as
well as a number of bankruptcy courts.  He also considered
attorney codes of ethics with respect to the issues of exercise
of independent professional judgment, impaired judgment or
divided loyalties, and "avoiding even the appearance of
impropriety."

     Stillman concluded that Weil Gotshal's multiple
representations and relationships with respect to the Leslie Fay
debtors and the audit committee members and their related firms
constituted holding and representing materially adverse interests
in violation of Section 327(a).  In addition, he rejected the
firm's argument that it did not have to disclose those
connections because it did not consider them adverse to the
estate.

     Stillman said, "The firm's failure to disclose led to
significant burden and cost to the estates and put a cloud over
its representation....  [Its] failure to disclose frustrated an
important component of the bankruptcy system -- that a
professional's qualifications be evaluated at the outset so that
bankruptcy cases can proceed without any taint of partiality or
the appearance of partiality, of the professionals involved."

               Stillman is a partner in the New York City firm of Stillman,
Friedman & Shaw.

ZALE: AKIN GUMP LIABLE FOR MALPRACTICE FOR LBO-RELATED ACTIONS

     Jewel Recovery, L.P., Zale Corp.'s litigation entity, filed
suit on May 16 against its former law firm, Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer & Feld, and partner Alan Feld, charging the firm and Feld
with professional and gross negligence, aiding and abetting
breaches of fiduciary duty, fraud, fraudulent conveyance and
improper distribution of corporate dividends (In re Zale
Corporation, ND TX Bank., No. 392-30001-SAF-11; Jewel Recovery,
LP v. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld et al., No. 394-3335).

     According to the complaint, the defendants participated with
Peoples Jewelers Limited's directors Irving Gerstein, Charles
Gill and James Gillies in undertaking a number of post-LBO
transactions which resulted in severely reducing Zale's assets,
paying dividends to a shell entity and denuding a Zale affiliate.
Defendant Feld, who was a Zale Credit Corporation (ZCC) director,
is charged with conflicts of interest in his overlapping roles as
ZCC director and name partner of Akin Gump.

     The plaintiff characterizes Zale's 1989 $438 million LBO of
Gordon Jewelry Corporation as "the beginning of the end for the
Debtors," as the price was two to three times the value of the
company and the debt assumed by Gordon to finance the transaction
left Gordon insolvent.  Because Akin Gump acted as special
counsel to Zale in the acquisition, the firm knew or should have
known that the LBO would ruin Gordon financially, says Jewel.

     After the LBO was consummated, Akin Gump also represented
Gordon in connection with an offering of public debt,
representing that the company's projected earnings would grow
exponentially after the acquisition, says Jewel.  In addition,
although Zale was its client, Akin Gump allowed the company to
release People and Swarovski International Holding from
guarantees on notes which had been secured prior to the Gordon
LBO.  Toronto-based Peoples and Swarovski of Switzerland bought
Zale in 1986 for $640 million.

     With respect to the "denuding" of ZCC, Jewel claims that a
series of transactions at a time when Feld had the "ultimate
authority" to approve or disapprove ZCC's investments led, among
other blunders, to a disastrous investment in Gordon's
Receivables Trust, which was represented by Akin Gump, and ZCC's
payment in early 1991 of a $50 million "alleged dividend" to its
sole shareholder, Zale.

     Jewel claims that the defendants engaged in fraud in a stock
transaction in connection with the Gordon LBO, arguing that the
series of transactions which constituted the LBO involved stock
in a corporation, and, therefore, was a stock transaction as the
term is used in the Texas Business and Commerce Code.  "The
prospectus governing the issuance of the Gordon Senior Notes
presented unrealistic and fraudulent projections as truthful and
realistic...," and Akin failed to disclose the falsity of the
representations, says Jewel.

     The complaint also states that the legal fees paid to Akin
Gump for its representation of Gordon in the LBO were made
pursuant to and were an integral part of the LBO.  Jewel is
seeking recovery of the fees as fraudulent conveyances under the
Texas Business and Commerce Code because Gordon allegedly did not
receive reasonable equivalent value for Akin Gump's services, and
was insolvent at the time the fees were paid.

     Feld's breach of fiduciary duty as director of ZCC allegedly
resulted in $150 million in damages to Zale, says the complaint,
and his role in the improper distribution resulted in $50 million
in damages.  The damages proximately caused by the gross
negligence of the ZCC directors, including Feld's gross
negligence, is not less than $150 million, says Jewel.

     The complaint was filed by James McCarthy, David Kent and
David Roberts of Hughes & Luce in Dallas.

AR JUDGE DISMISSES ATTEMPT TO BLOCK SUBPOENA OF FIRM DOCUMENTS

     A federal judge in Little Rock, AR, on Aug. 10 dismissed as
premature a suit filed by the Rose Law Firm against the
Resolution Trust Corp. seeking to block a subpoena for documents
concerning all the firm's clients going back to 1985 (Rose Law
Firm v. Resolution Trust Corp. et al., ED AR, Western Div., Civ.
No. LR-C-94-21; see Andrews' Professional Liability LR, July
1994, P. 17).

     In making the decision, U.S. District Judge Henry Woods
"confess[ed] serious misgivings about the scope of this
subpoena...[which] demands the production of a broad range of
documents covering more than ten years."  He also said that the
Rose firm "was understandably disturbed by the scope of the
subpoena," with which it was expected to comply within 10 days.

     Nevertheless, the judge said that he was persuaded by the
position advanced by RTC and its Office of Inspector General
(OIG).

     The judge cited the following excerpt from OIG's brief:
"One of the most firmly established principles of administrative
law is that courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over attempts by
subpoena recipients to secure judicial review of administrative
agency subpoenas....  [T]he courts uniformly hold that such
challenges are not ripe for judicial review.  Since
administrative subpoenas are not self-executing, recipients of
such subpoenas can raise their procedural and substantive
objections, including objections to the validity of the
underlying investigation, only if and when the government seeks
to enforce its subpoena in court."

     Rose's managing partner, Ronald Clark, said the firm "will
not comply with the subpoena absent a court order."  He said that
the firm had not decided whether to appeal Judge Woods' ruling.

     RTC/OIG issued the subpoena in connection with an
investigation into possible "conflicts of interest" at the Rose
firm, where First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was once a partner.
The probe resulted from controversy over investments made by
President and Mrs. Clinton in the "Whitewater" planned resort
development when the president was governor of Arkansas.  The
Clintons' co-investor was the owner of the now-defunct Madison
Guaranty Savings & Loan Association of Little Rock.  The
development never got off the ground, and the Clintons
purportedly lost money on the deal.  Rose has acknowledged that
it represented the thrift in a few isolated matters but insisted
it was never the thrift's primary counsel.

     On April 26 of this year, Rose sued for a declaratory
judgment that the subpoena is void because it seeks information
protected by the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, and the Arkansas Rules of Professional Responsibility.
RTC argued that the Rose action was premature because the court
has not been asked by either RTC or OIG to enforce the subpoena.

     RTC is represented by Robert E. Craddock Jr. and Leslie
Gattas Coleman of Dyer, James and Taylor in Memphis, TN, and by
RTC staff counsel Jonathan B. Taylor in Washington, DC.  In
addition to Clark, Rose is represented by staff attorneys Jerry
C. Jones and David L. Williams, and by Walter B. Stuart and
Andrew J. Logan of Vinson & Elkins in Houston, TX.

CLIENT: FINANCIAL ADVISOR PROVIDED "ERRONEOUS" ADVICE

     Cleveland-based Figgie International filed suit on Aug. 26
against Boston Consulting Group, Inc., alleging that between 1991
and 1994 the management consultant breached its contract with
Figgie by providing "erroneous market studies and business
reports and by designing and implementing TBC programs which were
flawed" (Figgie International, Inc. v. Boston Consulting Group,
Inc., ND OH, No. 1:94 CV 1763).

     Figgie said, in addition, that Boston Consulting (BCG)
engaged in negligence, negligent misrepresentation and breach of
fiduciary duty.  Figgie is seeking "no less than" $2 million in
damages.

     According to the complaint, Figgie engaged BCG to develop a
series of management projects to generate business and market
information and time-based capability (TBC) programs for Figgie.
BCG allegedly promised that Figgie would realize "above-average
growth and maximum profitability within a three-year period of
time."  Under the engagement letter between the two parties, BCG
was supposed to establish a budget for each project and promised
that fees charged would not exceed the budget amount.  In spite
of BCG's assertions, says Figgie, there were no fixed fee billing
arrangements with BCG.

     The company says BCG breached its contract with Figgie by
(1) failing to deliver the accurate market studies and business
reports and the TBC programs and TBC results; and (2) by
consistently overbilling Figgie for services and expenses.  BCG's
negligence is evidenced by its (1) failure to use qualified and
appropriately supervised personnel; (2) failure to properly plan
and schedule the various consulting projects; and (3) failure to
execute the projects in a timely manner, the complaint contends.

     The complaint was filed by Richard Cusick, William Coughlin
and Anthony LaCerva of Calfee, Halter & Griswold in Cleveland.

HHC, OTHERS CLAIM FORMER FINANCIERS BETRAYED THEIR FIDUCIARY
OBLIGATIONS

     Hillsborough Holdings Corp., Walter Industries Inc.,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) and others on Sept. 8 filed
suit against financiers Leon Black and Marc J. Rowan, claiming
the two betrayed their fiduciary obligations by profiting from
information about Walter Industries gathered while representing
KKR (In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp., MD FL Bankr., Nos. 89-
9715-8P1 through 89-9746-8P1 and 90-11997-8P1; Hillsborough
Holdings Corp. et al. v. Black et al., Adv. No. 94-562).

     In their suit, the plaintiffs allege that Black and Rowan,
who served as investment bankers for KKR while at Drexel Burnham
Lambert, Inc., gleaned information collected during KKR's
acquisition of Jim Walter Corp., the predecessor to Walter
Industries.  The complaint further alleges that the two used that
information to gain a competitive advantage in bids on debt
securities issued by their former clients.

     "As a result," the complaint alleges, "defendants were able
to purchase at a steep discount more than $160 million face
amount of debt securities of the Debtors.  Consistent with
Black's pattern of behavior, defendants have now attempted to use
the position they have acquired in Walter Industries to take
control of the organization, by stepping in as controlling
shareholders."

     Black and Rowan acted as fiduciaries of Walters until it
filed for Chapter 11 in December 1989, and as fiduciaries of KKR
interests until Drexel collapsed in February 1990.  According to
the complaint, during that time, the two allegedly had access to
information not available to the public, such as hidden values in
Walter's $1.1 billion mortgage portfolio and projections about
Walter's future performance.  The complaint further alleges that
Black used this information when making his purchase of Walter
bonds under the guise of his new firm, Apollo Advisors.

     One of those acquisitions, completed in March 1992, was a
major portion of Walter's outstanding debt, $120,445,719 in face
amount of senior subordinated extendible reset notes, $25 million
in face amount of subordinated notes due 1996, $12.375 million in
face amount of pre-leveraged buyout debt of Walter and
$2.25 million in face amount of series B & C senior extendible
reset notes.

     Black has filed one of two plans of reorganization for
Walter, his competing with one filed by the debtor.  Both plans
provide for payment in full of all secured claims and allowed
amounts of unsecured claims, including unsecured debt and trade
creditor claims.  Both are pending approval by the bankruptcy
court.

     "The Apollo Plan constitutes the final step in enabling the
Apollo Fiduciaries to consummate Black's original strategy to
utilize the confidential and proprietary valuable information
obtained from Walter Industries and the KKR Interests to obtain
control of Walter Industries and squeeze out the equity interests
of the KKR Interests and management," the complaint alleges.

     In this adversary proceeding, the plaintiffs are seeking
affirmative relief for breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation
of confidential business information and conversion.

     The complaint was filed by Michael Armstrong of Kirkpatrick
& Lockhart in New York City; by Don Stichter of Stichter, Riedel,
Blain & Prosser in Tampa; by Leonard Gilbert of Carlton, Fields,
Ward, Emmanuel, Smith & Cutler in Tampa; and by Philip Howard of
Howard, Darby, & Levin in New York City.

RELIANCE-ON-COUNSEL DEFENSE WAIVES PRIVILEGE, JUDGE RULES

     Even if defendant officers and directors do not always waive
an attorney-client privilege by generally asserting reliance on
counsel's advice as a general defense against reckless conduct
charges, they must produce communications relating to narrow
areas where the substance of the documents was injected into the
case through their specific statements of reliance, said a
federal judge in Wilmington Aug. 5  (In re ML-Lee Acquisition
Fund II, L.P. et al., D DE, No. 92-60).

     The suit claimed that ML-Lee Acquisition Fund II L.P. and
ML-Lee Acquisition Fund (Retirement Accounts) used false and
misleading claims to deceive those who bought limited partnership
interests in the funds between Nov. 10, 1989, and Jan. 5, 1990.
In addition to the federal securities law claims, the suit
asserted three causes of action that arise under Delaware law --
breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and fraud and
deceit.

     In an April 1 opinion, U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Farnan
allowed plaintiffs to proceed with a private right of action
under the Investment Company Act but barred them from bringing
aider and abettor charges against the advisors and allies of the
corporate and individual defendants under that statute.

     At the same time, the judge denied plaintiffs' motion to
compel the production of certain evidence withheld on the basis
of attorney-client privilege.  The court declined to decide that
defendants waived the privilege simply by stating during
depositions that they failed to take certain actions based on
advice of counsel, but it cautioned that if it found that
defendants were using the privilege as a shield to liability or
subsequently raised a reliance-on-counsel defense, the motion to
compel would be granted.

     Subsequently, plaintiffs contended that in answering an
amended complaint, defendants specifically relied on advice of
counsel in claiming that they believed in good faith that certain
transactions were well founded.

     "A client may waive the privilege by disclosure of some
privileged communication...or by asserting reliance upon the
advice of counsel as an essential element of his defense," the
court wrote.  Even if defendants are correct that simply denying
allegations of reckless conduct or generally asserting reliance
on counsel is not sufficient to waive the attorney-client
privilege, the court said, "In order for plaintiffs to have a
fair and adequate opportunity to test and rebut defendants'
allegations that they sought advice from counsel, plaintiffs are
entitled to know, for example whether the Lee defendants
disclosed all material facts to counsel, whether counsel gave an
otherwise well-informed opinion, [and whether] the Lee defendants
follow[ed] the advice from counsel."

     "Even if the Lee defendants intended only to rely on the act
of seeking advice from counsel to show they behaved in good
faith, plaintiffs are entitled to test the validity and sincerity
of that action," the court concluded.

     The court noted that the officers and directors specifically
stated that they relied on the advice of counsel as to certain
legal definitions, compliance with laws and fulfillment of
fiduciary duties -- responses which reach beyond simply denying
reckless conduct.

     As to the scope of the waiver, Judge Farnan noted that
defendants' assertions as to their reliance on counsel were very
specific and very narrow:  "Therefore, the defendants are
compelled to produce only those communications relating to the
specific areas in which defendants have asserted reliance on the
advice of counsel."

     Plaintiffs are represented by Pamela Tikellis, Carolyn D.
Mack and Cynthia Calder of Chimicles, Burt, Jacobsen & McNew in
Wilmington; Michael Freed and Carol Gilden of Much, Shelist,
Freed, Denenberg & Ament in Chicago; and William French, Robert
Gegios and Glen Lavy of Gibbs, Roper, Loots & Williams in
Milwaukee.

     The Merrill defendants are represented by Kenneth Nachbar of
Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell in Wilmington; and James
Benedict, Mark Holland, David Lewittes, Martin Seidel, Laura
Icken, James Moyle and Jeffrey Nanes of Rogers & Wells in New
York City.

     Certain ML-Lee defendants are represented by Stephen
Herrmann of Richards Layton & Finger in Wilmington and by Sanford
Remz and Richard Nicholson of Hutchins, Wheeler & Dittmar in
Boston.

     Other ML-Lee defendants are represented by Michael Goldman
and Stephen Norman of Potter, Anderson & Corroon in Wilmington
and John Donovan Jr. and Michael Fee of Ropes & Gray in Boston.

     Hutchins, Wheeler & Dittmar is represented by David McBride
and Bruce Stargatt of Young, Conaway, Stargatt & Taylor in

D MA WILL NOT DISMISS BANK'S NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS AGAINST ACCOUNTANT

     Two banks which lost "several million dollars" on a loan
default can sue the borrower's accountant for negligent and
intentional misrepresentation, ruled the U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts on Aug. 8, denying summary judgment
to the public accounting firm (Fleet National Bank et al. v. The
Gloucester Corporation, et al., D MA, No. 92-11812-REK).

     Based on its reading of the Restatement of Torts, the court
concluded that a jury could find that the accounting firm, "in
the course of its profession, supplied information in the form of
audit reports to [the borrower], with substantial certainty that
those reports would be supplied by [the borrower] to and relied
upon by the banks in deciding whether to extend credit to [the
borrower]."

     Plaintiff banks, Fleet National Bank and Cooperatieve
Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank (collectively, banks) filed
suit against Tonneson & Co. (Tonneson) to recover loan balances
outstanding when The Gloucester Corporation (TGC) defaulted on
multi-million dollar loans made in reliance on the "faulty"
audits and misstatements made by Tonneson.  Prior to the filing
of the suit, Tonneson had audited the financial statements of the
now-defunct TGC in 1989 and 1990.

     Tonneson argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law because under the tests most frequently applied by courts
both in and out of Massachusetts for determining whether
accounting firms owe a duty of care to persons with whom they are
not in privity, Tonneson owed no such duty to the banks.
Tonneson contends that the firm itself did not send the audited
financial statements to the banks; that the banks never
questioned Tonneson about the audited statements; and no one even
actually confirmed to Tonneson that the audited financial
statements had in fact been furnished to the banks.

     The court first noted that, although neither the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) nor the Massachusetts
Appeals Court has decided the question of whether a CPA owes a
duty of care to persons with whom the CPA is not in privity, the
SJC had issued a series of opinions involving liability of other
professionals to persons with whom they were not in privity.  The
court distinguished the roles of professionals such as lawyers
and doctors who are retained to provide services solely to the
persons who retained them, and CPAs who are "often engaged to
conduct an audit for the purpose of providing information --
indeed assurances -- to third parties."

     After a review of appropriate Massachusetts cases, the court
outlined four "guiding principles" for dealing with the issue of
potential unlimited liability under that state's law:  (1) the
defendant must have been hired to perform a particular task;
(2) performance of the task must have been for the benefit of a
particular person known to the defendant; (3) the plaintiff must
have had a reasonable expectation that the defendant would
perform the task in a manner such that the plaintiff should have
escaped the harm that befell him or her; and (4) the defendants
should have foreseen that the plaintiff or someone in his or her
position would be harmed in a manner and to the extent that the
plaintiff was harmed as a result of the defendant's negligence.

     Turning to non-Massachusetts precedent, the court determined
that three tests were applicable to the instant case:  the
foreseeability test, the near-privity test and the Restatement
test.  The court concluded that the SJS would probably not adopt
the foreseeability test, because so few other jurisdictions have
adopted it.   The court reached the same conclusion with respect
to the privity or near-privity test, on grounds of policy and
uncertainty of application, although the parties informed the
court that 14 jurisdictions have adopted that test.

     Finally, the court observed that the Restatement (Second) of
Torts test, which holds accountants and other professionals
liable for providing false information, justifiably relied upon
by others, when substantial harmful consequences are likely to
result, has been accepted by "at least" 19 jurisdictions, and
"seems to comport best with the Massachusetts cases that have
addressed the subject of professional liability in the absence of
privity."  That is, the Restatement test "limits the ambit of
accountant liability to an individual or a narrow class and
includes in the definition of 'intent' any consequence that the
accountant is 'substantially certain' will result from his or her
negligent misrepresentation," and thus "approaches the actual
knowledge standard of several Massachusetts cases, without adding
a linkage requirement that appears wholly foreign to
Massachusetts case law," it said.

     From a policy perspective, the Restatement test also
provides for proportionality, predictability, uniformity and
flexibility, said the court.

ND GA ENTERS PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR LBO ADVISOR

     U.S. District Court Judge G. Ernest Tidwell has entered
partial summary judgment orders on some of the claims brought by
Munford, Inc. against its LBO financial advisor in a 1991
$68 million adversary proceeding filed by the company to recover
corporate assets allegedly lost as a result of the 1988 leveraged
buyout of the company (In re Munford, Inc., ND GA Bankr., No. 90-
00078SWC; Munford v. Munford, No. 91-6417).

     Judge Tidwell adopted the bankruptcy court's findings and
dismissed breach of contract/negligence, fraudulent conveyance
and aiding and abetting claims against Shearson Lehman Brothers.

     The dispute arose from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Munford,
Inc, and the 1989 LBO which preceded it.  The 1991 adversary
complaint includes claims against a variety of participants in
the LBO, including Shearson, who was retained by Munford, Inc. in
1987 to evaluate the company's future.  Shearson concluded that a
sale of 100% of Munford's common stock would maximize shareholder
value, and that a leveraged buyout or leveraged recap would not
successfully maximize shareholder value.  Shearson also prepared
an offering memorandum to solicit potential purchasers for the
company and, later, an opinion indicating that the price offered
for Munford stock in the LBO was fair to the company's
shareholders.

     Shearson was charged with malpractice, negligence, breach of
contract and breach of fiduciary duty because the "firm failed to
counsel Munford carefully and completely concerning the financial
condition" of pre-LBO Munford, the value of its assets, the
financial effects of the LBO on Munford and the anticipated
insolvency of the company as a consequence of the LBO, the
company said.

     Munford also claimed that the $250,000 in fees paid to
Shearson were fraudulent conveyances and should be set
aside, and that the firm is also guilty of aiding and abetting a
breach of fiduciary duty by the company's board of directors.
The complaint alleges that Shearson learned of the "continuing
decline of Munford's operations" and that the company would be
rendered insolvent as a result of the LBO, but assisted the
directors in consummating the LBO anyway.

     In two April 4 opinions, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Cotton
recommended that the separate motions for summary judgment filed
by the DFA Entities and certain former Munford officer/directors
be denied, and that Shearson's motion be granted as to three
counts in the complaint.  Judge Tidwell modified in an Aug. 4
order.

     First, Judge Tidwell agreed with Judge Cotton that Munford's
claims of professional negligence, breach of contract, fraudulent
conveyance and aiding and abetting against Shearson should be
dismissed.  He said that Munford's failure to come forward with
expert testimony on the issue of the standard of care to be
exercised by a professional warranted dismissal of the negligence
allegation.  He noted that, while simple negligence claims do not
require expert testimony, assertions of professional negligence
can be established "only by professional or expert testimony."

     The court rejected Munford's contention that it was entitled
to rely on testimony by Shearson representatives to establish the
relevant standard of care, concluding that the testimony at issue
related to Shearson's contractual duty to Munford, and did not
establish an opinion about a general standard of care.

     With respect to Munford's claim that Shearson aided and
abetted the officer/director defendants' alleged breach of duty
to Munford, Judge Tidwell concluded that the bankruptcy court
correctly determined that Georgia law does not recognize that
tort, and that a Georgia court faced with the issue would not be
likely to create such a cause of action.  He observed that, in
view of the fact that fiduciary duties "are based on the special
relationship existing between two or more parties," the
imposition of aider and abettor liability for breaches of
fiduciary duty essentially extends fiduciary obligations beyond
the scope of the confidential or special relationship.

2ND CIR. REJECTS CHALLENGE TO MERRILL LYNCH FINANCING OFFER

     A suit claiming that Merrill Lynch, in connection with its
orchestration of the 1988 LBO of Texas-based Insilco Corporation,
participated in the distribution of securities through a
materially misleading prospectus and registration statement is
barred by the statute of limitations, said the Second Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 12 (Jackson National Life Insurance
Company v. Merrill Lynch & Co. Ins. et al., 2nd Cir., No. 93-
9287).

     The panel concluded that, even if the initial prospectus was
misleading, the warnings in the prospectus and the subsequent
offering memorandum put the plaintiff on inquiry notice of the
fraud more than one year before the tolling date.

     Insilco Corporation underwent an LBO in August 1988 and, as
a result, took on debt that included approximately $405 million
in "bridge financing" provided by Merrill Lynch to ensure the
deal's success.  The terms of the bridge loan required Insilco to
engage in a public offering of high-yield "junk" bonds and
warrants and to use the proceeds to repay the bridge financing
provided by Merrill Lynch.  Plaintiff Jackson National Life
Insurance Company (Jackson) responded to Merrill Lynch's
solicitation by purchasing nearly $8 million in principal amount
of Insilco securities in January 1989.

     In May 1990, Insilco embarked upon a recapitalization and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an offering
memorandum which updated the company's financial condition.  The
recap plan failed and Insilco filed for Chapter 11 protection in
January 1991.

     Jackson filed suit against Merrill Lynch under 11 and 12(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933 and 20A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, alleging three material misstatements or omissions:
(1) the prospectus falsely indicated that the January 1989
offering was being conducted on an "all or none" basis when
Merrill Lynch knew all the securities could not be sold to the
public; (2) the prospectus failed to disclose that the "qualified
independent underwriter" was not informed that the offering would
not be conducted on an "all or none" basis because there was no
public market for the entire offering; and (3) the prospectus
failed to warn that the LBO had rendered Insilco insolvent before
the offering took place.

     In addition to declaring the suit barred by the statute of
limitations, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York also held that Jackson did not state a claim under 20A
of the 1934 Act because it did not plead a predicate violation of
the 1934 Act as that section requires.

     The Second Circuit panel affirmed in an opinion by Judge
John Walker.

     First, said Judge Walker, the statute of limitations
applicable to Jackson's 1933 Act claims is one year "after the
discovery of the untrue statement of omission, or after such
discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable
diligence.... [emphasis in the original]."  He concluded that
Jackson had at its disposal the facts from which it could have
discovered the misstatement it alleges more than one year before
the tolling date.

     Beginning with Jackson's "all or none" claims, Judge Walker
said that, among the "early storm warnings" available to alert
Jackson that the Merrill Lynch offering was not an "all or none"
offering was the fact that (1) the prospectus contained no
provisions for escrow accounts and refund arrangements; (2) the
1989 Insilco offering was conducted by Merrill Lynch on a "firm
commitment" basis; and (3) the May 1990 offering memorandum
circulated in connection with the recap revealed that Merrill
Lynch "currently" owned about 50% of the securities offered in
1989 and that only a "limited" market for the securities had
developed.

     The court said that, even if it assumed that the ambiguous
language in the prospectus "unmistakably gave the misleading
impression that the offering was being conducted on an all or
none basis, the aggregate of circumstances in the case was
sufficient to put a reasonable investor on notice that the
underwriting was not to be conducted on an all or none basis."

     Turning to Jackson's insolvency claim, Judge Walker observed
that the reasonableness of Jackson's reliance on statements of
Insilco's solvency in the prospectus to support its claim that it
could not have known of an imminent bankruptcy "must be assessed
against the actual language of the prospectus."  The solvency
opinion in the prospectus was contingent on future events,
primarily the ability to generate increased operating income,
over which Insilco had only limited control, said the court, and
was followed by the statement "no assurance could be given that a
court would confirm the company's position with respect to the
solvency issues."

     Judge Walker said additional evidence of potential
insolvency can be found in the prospectus' financial information,
which showed the impact of the LBO on the company's finances and
disclosed that the company's high debt-to-equity ratio resulting
from the LBO might adversely affect the company's ability to meet
principal and interest payments as they came due.  In addition,
the offering memorandum 16 months later revealed that Insilco was
experiencing severe cash flow problems which might render it
unable to meet its current liabilities, the court said.

     Finally, Judge Walker addressed Jackson's claim under 20A,
which has a five-year statute of limitations, and rejected
Jackson's contention that it should be allowed to proceed under
20A for violations of 11 and 12(2) of the 1933 Act because
remedies of the 1933 and 1934 Acts were "meant to be cumulative,
not exclusive."  The court said that the language of Section 20A
makes it clear that "Congress sought to alter the remedies
available in insider trading cases and only in insider trading
cases [emphasis in the original]."

     Jackson was represented by Raymond Levites, Richard Cashman
and Diane Britton of Pavelic & Levites.  Counsel for Merrill
Lynch were Jack Auspitz, Debra Freeman and Claire Silberman of
Morrison & Foerster.  Both firms are located in New York City.

10TH CIR. HOLDS CLAIMS AGAINST CONSULTANT NOT RELATED TO ERISA

     A panel of the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held
June 30 that the state law claims of trustees of an ERISA-
governed plan against a negligent outside consultant were not
preempted because none of the claims related closely enough to
the plan  (Airparts Company, Inc. et al. v. Custom Benefit
Services of Austin, Inc., 10th Cir., No. 93-3268).

     The decision reversed and remanded a ruling by the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas which dismissed the
complaint brought by Airparts Company, Inc. against defendant
Custom Benefit Services of Austin, Inc., d/b/a First Actuarial
Corp. (FAC), on the grounds that their state law claims were
preempted by ERISA.

     The plaintiffs, co-trustees of an ERISA-governed plan,
brought state law claims of negligence, implied indemnity and
common law fraud against FAC, a firm hired by the plaintiffs to
provide expert benefit plan consultation.  Specifically, the
plaintiffs alleged that FAC failed to give timely advice to
Airparts on the effects of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1987, improperly calculated pension benefits, proposed and
drafted a useless plan amendment and deliberately concealed the
cost of the amendment and its eventual uselessness from the
plaintiffs.

     In an opinion delivered by Judge Oliver Seth, the panel held
that the state law claims put forth by Airparts did not relate to
an ERISA plan and therefore were not preempted.  The state laws
involved in the case, the panel said, did not regulate the type
of benefits or terms of the plan; they did not create reporting,
disclosure, funding or vesting requirements for the plan; they
did not affect the calculation of benefits; and they were not
common law rules designed to rectify faulty plan administration.

     "Plaintiffs' state law claims against FAC do not have and
will not have any effect whatsoever on the relations among the
traditional plan entities," the panel said.  "Those principals,
the employer, the plan, the plan fiduciaries, and the
beneficiaries, are united in their efforts to secure redress from
defendants.  A recovery from defendants will increase the coffers
of the plan; a defeat will mean that the plan has expended money
in fruitless litigation.  Such a tangential effect, however, is
not enough to relate these state law claims to the plan itself."

     Continuing, the panel held that Airparts' claims would not
affect the structure, administration or the type of benefits
provided by the ERISA-governed plan.  In addition, the panel
noted that the plaintiffs made no claim based on any rights under
the plan and there was no allegation that any of the plan's terms
had been breached.  Also, there was no effort to enforce or
modify the terms of the plan and there was no threat that, by
allowing the suit to go forward, conflicting regulations would
emerge which would destroy the structural unity of the ERISA
scheme.

     Moreover, the panel said that the plan administrator in this
case was Airparts, not FAC.  FAC was simply an outside consultant
which did not directly perform any administrative act vis-a-vis
the plan, it said.  Addressing congressional purpose in enacting
ERISA, the panel said that it saw "no congressional purpose to be
furthered by denying an ERISA plan a state cause of action
against allegedly negligent third-party service providers."

 Carparts Co. is represented by Paul Arabia in Wichita, KS.
Counsel for Custom Benefit Services is Joseph H. Bocock and
Michael F. Lauderdale in Oklahoma City, OK.

HOLDERS TELL COURT THAT ANY FISCAL CONFLICT BARS DISINTEREST

     Contrary to the position taken by the Delaware Chancery
Court and defendant directors of Western Airlines Inc., the
Western board could not rely on the recommendations of its
financial advisor for a merger decision because, in this context,
any fiscal conflict of interest, no matter what the source,
removes independence and disinterest, plaintiff shareholders
argued to the Delaware Supreme Court in a brief filed July 26
(Rand et al. v. Western Airlines Inc., DE Sup. Ct., No. 94-94).

     Frederick Rand, seeking to represent other shareholders of
Western Airlines, challenged the price at which the airline was
acquired by Delta.  The suit alleged that due to their corporate
positions, the individual defendants had information -- which
they allegedly withheld from the class -- that would indicate
that Western was worth substantially more than the preshare price
offered, especially considering its synergy value.

     Rand charged that the Western board breached its duty of
care by allegedly agreeing to a stock option pact with Delta as
well as a no-shop and no-talk pact as part of the merger
agreement.  He claimed that in return for lucrative golden
parachutes, Western's board violated its Revlon duty to seek the
best value for shareholders once it became apparent that the
company would change hands.  The suit alleged that the board did
not even seek an opinion from an independent adviser on the
fairness of the Delta offer.

     In a Sept. 11, 1989, opinion, Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger
dismissed Delta but found that two claims against Western's
directors and officers could not be resolved on a motion to
dismiss:  (1) the Revlon claim that the board failed to auction
the company; and (2) a disclosure claim that the directors
violated their duty of complete candor by withholding information
on the true value of the company.

               On defendants' motion for summary judgment, the vice
chancellor, in a Feb. 25 opinion, found reason to dismiss those
claims.  Although an "enhanced scrutiny" standard must be applied
here, "the essential question remains whether a disinterested
board has satisfied its duty to act on a fully informed basis,"
the court stated.  Nor was the existence of golden parachute
provisions for three of Western's chief negotiators enough to
question their independence, the court said.

     In their opening brief, Rand said that, contrary to the law,
the lower court had, on a motion for summary judgment, "refused
to draw a single inference in plaintiffs' favor."  For instance,
as to duty of loyalty, appellants argued:  "A director is not
independent if he can reasonably anticipate special benefits
flowing from the transaction submitted to the board for its
approval,...[but the chancery court] improperly overlaid an
additional element in determining the existence of divided
loyalty."

     In reply, Western contended that the chancery court had
properly held that the Western board satisfied its Revlon duties
in approving the merger agreement by (1) canvassing the market
and contacting virtually every airline about the possibility of a
merger, acquisition, or joint marketing agreement;
(2) considering the severe disadvantages it faced in a newly regulated
market; and (3) considering the extensive work performed by fincancial
advisor Dillon Reed.
    Since Delta was the only offer to come forward after a 15-month
search, Western contended, the court properly concluded that the price
Western's board obtained was only not fair but the highest price
possible.
    In their reply brief, plaintiffs argued that at the very least,
they have shown that there is a question of material fact that would
preclude summary judgment as to both duty of care and loyalty charges.
Both the chancery court and defendants miss the point
point in pointing to the fact that Dillon Reed did not have to
back the disputed merger to get its bonus, they said.  "Dillon
was highly motivated to recommend a transaction rather than
suggest that Western continue as an ongoing enterprise,"
plaintiffs said, and, since time was running out, the contested
deal was the only practical way to get that money.

     Defendants' contention that a previous higher offer was
subject to conditions and thus not material is unsupported by
authority and flies in the face of common knowledge that most
such offers are at the outset subject to numerous conditions,
appellants argued in support of their assertion that the board
did not pursue alternatives.  Nor can it be concluded summarily
that Western gained a substantial benefit that justified the
lock-up and no-shop provisions, appellants said.

     "Defendants do not deny the financial interest of Western's
negotiators," appellants asserted.  "Rather they seem to say that
such a conflict is permissible so long as the financially
conflicted party did not initiate the set of circumstances
leading to the conflict.  To the contrary, it is cut and dried
that a director who receives a substantial benefit from
supporting a transaction cannot be objectively viewed as
disinterested or independent.  The Chancery Court recognized that
conflict but disregarded its importance."

     Even if none of these elements are a litmus test for breach
of duty, they create, at the very least, a question that can only
be decided at trial, appellants said.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and Kevin
Gross of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington, DE;
and by Roger Kirby of Kaufman, Malchman, Kirby & Squire in New
York City.  Defendants are represented by Charles Richards Jr.

11TH CIR.: INTRODUCING BROKER, AGENT CANNOT COMPEL ARBITRATION

     An introducing broker/dealer and its agent were not third-
party beneficiaries of an arbitration agreement between the
plaintiff and a clearing broker and, therefore, cannot compel
arbitration of the plaintiff's securities, common law fraud,
breach of fiduciary obligation and, under the Texas Deceptive
Trade Practices-Consumer Act, negligence and conspiracy claims
against them, said the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Aug. 19 (Taylor v. Investors Associates, Inc., et al., 11th Cir.,
No. 93-5049).

     The panel said that the defendants did not qualify as third-
party beneficiaries because an intent to benefit them was not
apparent from the construction of the arbitration agreement "in
light of all surrounding circumstances."

     According to court documents, co-defendant Mitchell
Goldberg, as agent for co-defendant Investors Associates, Inc.
(IAI), solicited plaintiff Don Taylor to buy and sell stock from
IAI.  On Jan. 6, 1992, Taylor purchased stock through IAI and,
the next day, signed a client's agreement with Prudential-Bache
Securities, which was to serve as clearing broker in the trading
arrangement.

     Taylor subsequently filed suit against IAI and Goldberg,
alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; Rule 10(b)(5); Section 12(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933; Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO); Texas Blue Sky Law; Texas Business and Commerce Code and
the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act.  The defendants
moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration or dismiss the
action.

     The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
concluded that the defendants could not compel arbitration, and
the appeals court panel affirmed in a per curiam opinion, which
adopted the trial court's decision.

     In his opinion below, U.S. District Judge William Justice
first noted that the arbitration clause did not mention IAI or
Goldberg by name or function, nor did those parties sign the
document.  Judge Justice rejected the defendants' contention that
they were included as parties to the pact through the use of
"you" (referring to Prudential) in the client's agreement,
because IAI allegedly supplied Taylor with the agreement.

     Second, Judge Justice said that the intent of the parties to
the arbitration agreement was manifest -- to arbitrate claims by
or against the clearing house concerning its handling of Taylor's
account.  In addition, a letter from Prudential, explaining that
it was not Taylor's broker, but his broker's clearing firm, makes
it clear that the defendants were independent from Prudential,
said the judge.

     Third, the defendants cannot rely on agency principles to
support their argument that they are entitled to enforce the
arbitration agreement, said the court.  Unlike the fact
situations in the cases cited by the defendants, here, the
disputed transaction did not involve the liquidation of stock
whereby the clearing house's services were employed, which might
make the clearing house a party to the suit, Judge Justice noted.
No claims in the suit pertain to Prudential's or Taylor's
accounts there, he said, and, hence, there was no contingent
right for the introducing broker to invoke the arbitration
agreement.

     Finally, with respect to the defendants' third-party
beneficiary argument, the defendants are not mentioned in the
arbitration agreement, and no consent to arbitration with
Goldberg or IAI may be implied based solely on the relationship
between the introducing broker and the clearing house, said the
court.

2ND CIR. REVERSES FINDING FOR CARRIER ON PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY

     The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 8 by a 2-1
margin overturned a summary judgment for an insurer on the
coverage demands of a lawyer policyholder, finding that the
policy language of the professional liability policy in issue
that disclaims coverage "for the return of or restitution of
legal fees, costs and expenses" is ambiguous with respect to
claims involving fees paid to third parties (McCostis v. Home
Insurance Co. of Indiana, 2nd Cir., No. 93-9283).

               The insured, Richard M. McCostis, was a partner in the firm
of McCostis & Lind and also served as director, secretary and
outside general counsel of Barr Laboratories.  In September 1990,
Barr became a client of the law firm of Winston & Strawn.

     Winston & Strawn subsequently named McCostis and ex-W&S
partner Lawrence Fox to a lawsuit that alleged that the two
attorneys conspired to overbill Barr for upwards of $756,000.  Of
this amount, McCostis allegedly pocketed $335,000 and Fox
received the balance.  W&S' suit against the lawyers was grounded
in RICO, common law fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.  W&S
reimbursed Barr for its loss and received an assignment of rights
as against McCostis and Fox.

     McCostis tendered the claim to his professional liability
carrier, Home Insurance Co. of Indiana.  Home initially assumed
the defense, but disclaimed coverage based on the policy
definition of damages which specifically excluded claims "for the
return of or restitution of legal fees, costs and expenses."

     McCostis lodged a declaratory judgment suit in the Southern
District of New York.  The trial court granted summary judgment
to the carrier, determining that the suit against McCostis was
essentially for the return of legal fees and expenses.

     McCostis argued on appeal that since the complaint alleged
that he only received $335,000, but seeks to recover the full
amount embezzled, Winston & Strawn are seeking some element of
damages as well as the return of the funds.  The insured also
argued that the policy also specifically covers claims for
negligent breach of fiduciary duty.

     In reversing, the Second Circuit found that the policy
language did "not provide a clear answer to the question of
whether the return or restitution of legal fees exclusion would
be applicable for disputes concerning fees paid to third
parties."  The panel wrote that "the use of the words 'return'
and 'restitution' seems to indicate that the exclusion would
pertain only to situations where the insured received the
disputed funds and is forced to repay the monies to the client."

     The panel vacated and remanded with instructions to the
Southern District to consider extrinsic evidence (if any) that
would demonstrate the actual intent of the parties.

ED MI REJECTS EQUITABLE SUBROGATION IN ATTORNEY MALPRACTICE CASE

     A federal judge in Detroit on July 11 rejected an insurer's
effort to use equitable subrogation to justify a malpractice suit
against attorneys whom the insurer had selected to defend its
policyholder, finding that the insurer had lost all subrogation
rights when its policyholder dismissed the malpractice claim with
prejudice (Preferred Risk Mutual Insurance Company v. Hoiby et
al., No. 93-CV-71397-DT).

     Allstate Car Leasing Corporation was sued in state court
automobile negligence litigation after a 1979 accident.  Allstate
was insured under a $250,000 liability policy issued by plaintiff
Preferred.  Preferred retained the defendant lawyers, Eugene
Hoiby and Robert Kanter, to represent the Allstate.  After two
trials, the case was settled when Preferred paid $1.3 million.

     Before the settlement, Allstate had sued Preferred and the
lawyers, alleging bad faith by the insurer and professional
negligence by the lawyers, including failure of the lawyers to
keep it fully informed, failure to solicit a settlement and
negligently directing the defense of the underlying tort
litigation.  After the $1.3 million settlement was reached, the
owner stipulated to dismissal of its malpractice and bad faith
complaint with prejudice.

     However, Preferred then filed a diversity-based legal
malpractice complaint in the Eastern District of Michigan.  The
lawyers moved for summary judgment.

     Judge George E. Woods granted the defense motion.

     In general, an insurer may use the doctrine of equitable
subrogation -- rather than rely on a direct attorney-client
relationship -- to pursue a malpractice claim against lawyers it
retained for its policyholder, he said.  Because subrogation
gives the insurer only rights owed to the policyholder, defense
counsel's loyalties are not compromised by the equitable
subrogation approach, he said.

     In this case, however, the policyholder already had agreed
to dismiss its own malpractice claim with prejudice, and
Preferred had consented to that dismissal with a purported
reservation of its own rights.  Woods found that purported
reservation of rights to be ineffective, though; Preferred, as a
subrogee, cannot maintain the malpractice claim that its
policyholder already had relinquished.

WD MI: MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS VOID MALPRACTICE POLICY

     Whether a psychologist's purportedly material
misrepresentations in an application and renewal application for
a professional liability policy void the policies ab initio can
be resolved in a federal declaratory judgment action, a judge in
Grand Rapids, MI, has ruled.  A single decision on whether there
is an insurance contract under which the psychologist can demand
defense and indemnification for sexual assault and related claims
will resolve the issue for a number of active and prospective
state tort suits, according to the July 15 decision  (Chicago
Insurance Co. v. Regt et al., WD MI, No. :93-CV-764).

     Chicago Insurance Co. issued malpractice policies to John M.
Regt, Ph.D., for 1991 and 1992.  In 1993, the intervening
codefendants filed state court complaints alleging sexual abuse,
negligence and breach of the policyholder's professional standard
of care.  The policyholder filed for bankruptcy.

     The insurer then filed a diversity-based declaratory
judgment complaint in the Western District of Michigan, alleging
that the misrepresentations made the policies invalid and
unenforceable.  The intervening codefendants in turn filed state
court declaratory judgment complaints against the plaintiff and
another insurer that is not a party to the federal action.

     The intervening codefendants moved for summary judgment or
dismissal of the federal action on the pleadings, citing the
pending state court litigation.

     U.S. Judge Robert Holmes Bell denied the motion, ruling that
a federal judgment would clarify and settle the legal relations
between the insurer and its policyholder and would afford relief
from the uncertainty, insecurity and controversy giving rise to
the proceeding.

     A declaratory judgment would settle the controversy without
requiring any evidence about the policyholder's alleged
professional misconduct and negligence that are at the core of
the state litigation, Bell ruled.  It would apply both to the
pending suits and any future tort actions against the
policyholder, he said.  The judgment also would clarify the
insurer's obligations, the court wrote.

     Judge Bell found no evidence that the insurer had initiated
the declaratory judgment action for procedural fencing or to
provide an arena for res judicata.  Nor would a declaratory
judgment increase friction between state and federal courts
because a decision on coverage would not depend on a factual
record in the underlying tort litigation, he said.

     Although the state court could decide the issue, the issues
in the tort actions are different, he said, and a resolution of
insurance coverage does not depend on or have any legal affect on
a state court declaratory action against another insurer.
Because there is no duplication of factual or legal issues, a
state court would not necessarily present a better or more
effective remedy, he said.

HEALTH INSURANCE - AIDS COVERAGE
EEOC Settlement: Mason Tenders District Council Welfare Fund

EEOC has announced that it has negotiated a $1 million settlement
of its complaint against the Mason Tenders District Council
Welfare Fund, a union-administered health insurance plan.

The Fund's plan, which covered more than 10,000 workers and their
families, specifically excluded health insurance coverage for
illnesses related to AIDS and HIV infections.

EEOC had filed claims contending that the exclusion violated the
Americans With Disabilities Act on behalf of a number of union
members who were denied health insurance coverage for AIDS and
HIV-related medical problems.

Mason Tenders had argued that as a self-administered, self-funded
health insurance plan, it was not subject to ADA. Its claims were
rejected by a federal district court, which held that ADA
applied. Rather than litigate the issue further, Mason Tenders
elected to settle the case with EEOC.

In response to Mason Tenders claim that "it had to limit AIDS
benefits because of losses from huge health care bills," EEOC
said that limitations on benefits are permitted where the
employer demonstrates that there were actuarial reasons for
treating classes of employees differently. Here, however, EEOC
attorney James Lee said that Mason Tenders was "paying for every
other high-priced condition" but was excluding AIDS and HIV-
related medical expenses.

EDITOR'S NOTE: In McGann v H&H Music Company, 946 F2d 401, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an employer's self-insured health
plan that limited benefits paid for AIDS and HIV-related medical
expenses did not violate the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The
application of ADA to  self-insured health plans has yet to be
considered by the high court.

APPLYING FOR EMPLOYMENT
Kemer v Johnson, USDC SDNY, 93-Civ, 6965

Must an employer assist a mentally ill job applicant in filling
out a job application or be in violation of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973? Not if the applicant fails to inform the employer of
his or her disability, according to the federal district court
decision in Kemer v Johnson.

The Court decided that Eric N. Kemer, an applicant for
employment with the General Services Administration (GSA), did
not make a prima facie case that he was "otherwise qualified" for
the position because he failed to complete his application form.
The Court held that "filing an application is an essential
prerequisite for any position [with GSA]."

GSA had told Kemer that his application was incomplete. It had
sent him another employment application form, inviting him to
properly complete it and resubmit it to the agency. The Court
said this constituted a reasonable accommodation.

Kemer represented himself as having a "depressive neurosis and a
schizotypical personality disorder." He contended that GSA should
have accommodated his disability by providing him with assistance
in completing the application form.

The Court noted that people with such mental conditions are
entitled to protection under the Rehabilitation Act. But, the
Court said, "employers are only required to make reasonable
accommodation to the known mental and physical limitations of a
qualified applicant." Kemer never notified GSA of his disability.
Also, Kemer offered no evidence that his disability interfered
with his ability to successfully complete the employment
application form.

PARKING FOR DISABLED WORKERS
Lyons v Legal Aid Society, CA2, 95-7030

An employer may be required to provide a disabled employee with a
parking space as a reasonable accommodation or be in violation of
the Americans With Disabilities Act, according to a ruling by the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, Second Circuit [NY].

Legal Aid Society attorney Beth Lyons charged the Society with
violating ADA when it rejected her request for a paid parking
space. Lyons said that she needed a parking space near her office
because her ability to walk had been seriously impaired by a car
accident. Paying for parking, according to Lyons, cost her about
20% of her salary - approximately $400 a month.

Although a federal district court judge dismissed her claim as
being outside the scope of ADA, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals reinstated it.

The Court said that "an essential aspect of many jobs is the
ability to appear at work regularly and on time." Accordingly,
providing a parking space may constitute a "reasonable
accommodation" required by ADA under certain circumstances.

In the Circuit Court's view, "there is nothing unreasonable [in
terms of legislative intent] in requiring an employer to furnish
an otherwise qualified disabled employee with assistance related
to her ability to get to work."

In response to the Society's argument that parking and other
forms of "commuting assistance" were not provided to other
employees, the Circuit said that "Congress envisioned that
employer assistance with transportation to get the employee to
and from the job might be covered" and EEOC guidelines
specifically mention "reserved parking spaces" as a reasonable
accommodation.

The Circuit Court remanded the matter to the district court with
the observation that "Legal Aid may be able to develop evidence
prior to trial showing that [Lyons'] request is unreasonable."

HEALTH INSURANCE GUIDELINES
Federal Register, 60 FR 60720

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has announced that it
will publish proposed guidelines concerning the Americans With
Disabilities Act's impact on health insurance. The proposed
guidelines are expected to be issued in September 1996.

EEOC said that the guidelines will "reduce confusion and
uncertainty on the part of insurers, employers and individuals
with disabilities regarding the applicability of the Act to
various health insurance provisions."

ADA IN DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
Mohamed v Marriott International, DC SDNY, 94 Civ 2336

The Mohamed decision suggests that a deaf person must be provided
with a sign interpreter at all stages of a disciplinary
investigation or proceeding. In addition,  the decision strongly
implies that ADA's reasonable accommodation mandates requires the
employer to provide a sign interpreter at other meetings that a
deaf worker attends, including meetings involving an evaluation
of his or her work performance.

Ahmed Mohamed, a deaf person, performed maintenance work for
Marriott Marquis Hotel's engineering department. A native of
Egypt, Mohamed  communicated in American Sign Language although
he had a limited ability to read and write English.

Mohamed found a coworkers handbag containing $480. Although
Marriott policy required employees who found money to turn it
over to a guard, Mohamed put the money in his locker.

The loss was discovered and Mohamed was immediately interviewed
by three members of Marriott management concerning the money. One
manager had some minimal training in sign language, but it proved
insufficient for the occasion. After more than an hour the
meeting was terminated. Mohamed was advised that a second meeting
at which an sign interpreter would be present would be scheduled.

At the second meeting, at which the interpreter was present,
Mohamed related the same story that he had earlier attempted to
communicate -- he could not find his supervisor and therefore he
placed the money in his locker. Marriott terminated Mohamed
because he failed to follow Marriott's policy of turning money
found in the hotel to a guard.

Mohamed sued, claiming (1) the absence of an interpreter at the
first meeting violated ADA's requirement that employer's provide
disabled workers with a reasonable accommodation and (2)
disparate treatment in that he was terminated because of his
deafness.

Marriott, on the other hand, argued that regardless of any
disability, Mohamed would have been dismissed because he violated
hotel policy.

The Court rejected Marriott's claim that providing an interpreter
at the second meeting met ADA's reasonable accommodation
requirement on the grounds that the lack of an interpreter at the
first meeting "set a tone of mistrust of Mohamed that inalterably
led to his discharge." This, said the Court, warranted a trial to
determine whether providing an interpreter at the second meeting
was sufficient to satisfy ADA's reasonable accommodation
requirements.

According to the ruling, the need for the accommodation arose not
in the course of the termination per se, but "in the course of a
meeting with an employee to review the disappearance of something
of value."

As to ADA's requirement that employer provide workers with a
reasonable accommodation, the Court said that "the fact that the
meeting eventually led to termination makes it no less an element
of Mohamed's job performance than a staff meeting, a performance
evaluation or a salary review," indicating that a sign
interpreter would be required at those meetings as well.

Nevertheless, the Court, dismissed Mohamed's claim based on
disparate treatment, finding that Marriott's decision to fire him
"did not result from his deafness." On this point the decision
states:

Although Mohamed's discharge may have ... resulted from his
deafness, Marriott's decision to discharge him was not motivated
by his deafness. It is true that a hearing person would not have
found himself in the same predicament as Mohamed. It is not true,
however, that Marriott's decision to fire Mohamed was based on
his deafness. In other words, Marriott's firing Mohamed based on
his actions [handling the money] were not a pretext for
discharging him because he was deaf.

MODIFYING JOB DUTIES
Kuehl v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., DC Colo 95-S-393

Vicke Kuehl was employed as a "greeter" by Sam's Wholesale Club,
a Wal-Mart store. According to Wal-Mart, standing was critical to
serving as a greeter.

Kuehl was diagnosed as having chronic tibula tendinitis. While
she was being treated for the condition Wal-Mart reduced her work
hours and allowed her breaks every two hours. When she returned
to work, Kuehl asked to be allowed to sit on a stool while on
duty as a greeter. Wal-Mart refused to allow Kuehl to use a
stool, but offered her the opportunity to work a split-shift or
working as a cashier.

Kuehl sued, contending that Wal-Mart violated ADA by refusing to
accommodate her request to use a stool while working as a
greeter.

A federal district court judge granted Wal-Mart's motion for
summary judgment. The Court ruled that Kuehl's impairment was not
severe enough to constitute a disability since it limited only
her ability to perform one particular job -- door greeter.

However, even if Kuehl was disabled within the meaning of ADA she
would have lost. The Court said that Wal-Mart had shown that
standing was an essential part of a greeter's job and that it had
reasonably accommodated Kuehl by offering her alternative
employment. Further, the Court said that employers are not
required to modify the actual duties of the job in order to make
an accommodation, citing Daugherty v El Paso, 5 EDR 86.

RETROACTIVE SENIORITY AS REDRESS
Beame v DeLeon, _ NY2d _

State and municipal human rights agencies have "broad remedial
powers" according to the ruling by New York State's Court of
Appeals in Beame v DeLeon. These powers allow the agency to award
retroactive seniority to persons found to have been victims of
unlawful discrimination, notwithstanding provisions in the
State's Civil Service Law to the contrary.

The case involved the treatment of women in the New York City
Police Department. The New York City Human Rights Commission had
found that the Department had "engaged in a pattern of unlawful
discrimination against women."

Unlawful acts by the Department included (1) establishing
employment quotas that limited the number of women who could be
appointed to less than 2 percent of the police force; (2)
discriminatory layoff policies that resulted in more than half
the women being laid off during a financial crisis in 1976 while
only 10 percent of the male police officers were laid off; (3)
mandatory assignment of women police officers as matrons; and (4)
restricting the number of precincts to which women could be
assigned.
The Human Rights Commission awarded 43 complainants retroactive
seniority for pension and other purposes, together with $533,000
collectively in compensatory damages for mental anguish.
Complaints filed by an additional 38 active and former
policewomen are pending before the Commission.

The Court said that the Legislature had granted broad remedial
powers to state and municipal human rights agencies to counteract
the impact of past discrimination in employment. According, the
Court ruled that "under these circumstances [there is] no doubt
that a resolution which may somewhat subordinate the discretion
of the appointing authority to the complainants' rights to
remediation for the discriminatory practices of that authority is
more consistent with legislative intent."

Upholding the authority of the Division to award retroactive
seniority as redress for unlawful discrimination, the Court
distinguished this remedy from the limitations place on the
Division's directing the appointment of an individual.  The Court
of Appeals referred to its decision in City of Schenectady v
State Div. of Human Rights, 37 NY2d 42l.

In the Schenectady case the Court ruled that allowing the
Division to order the appointment of an otherwise qualified
individual would impinge on the discretion of the statutory
authority appointing authority to make an appointment, citing Section 61
of the Civil Service Law. It found no similar prohibition in the
granting of retroactive seniority equal to the seniority the
individual would have enjoyed but for the discriminatory act.

SEXUAL ORIENTATION
Proposed Employment Non-discrimination Act, S-932; HR-1863

Pending before the 104th  Congress is the Employment Non-
Discrimination Act [Senate 932; House of Representatives 1863].
The bill would prohibit discrimination in the workplace on the
basis of sexual orientation. According to sponsors, The
Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1995 (ENDA)  is intended to
ensure fair employment practices -- not special rights -- for
lesbians, gay men and bisexuals. According to Sen. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), one of 150 co-sponsors, it is now legal in 42 states
to fire someone based on sexual orientation.

Under ENDA, covered entities cannot subject an individual to
different standards or treatment based on that individual's
sexual orientation, or discriminate against an individual based
on the sexual orientation of those with whom the individual
associates.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The `disparate impact' claim available under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) is not available
under ENDA. Therefore, an employer is not required to justify a
neutral practice that may have a statistically disparate impact
based on sexual orientation.

ENDA does not apply to employers with fewer than fifteen
employees. It also exempts religious organizations, educational
institutions substantially controlled or supported by religious
organizations, and the military.

ENDA prohibits preferential treatment, including quotas, based on
sexual orientation. It does not require an employer to provide
benefits for the same-sex partner of an employee.

EDITOR'S NOTE: ENDA provides for the same remedies (injunctive
relief and damages) as are permitted under Title
VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

The act applies to Congress, with the same remedies as provided
by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. ENDA would not
be retroactive.

For full text of the bill and comments that have appeared in the
Congressional Record, see the affirmative action page on NYPER's
home page. The address is:

PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION
Quarantino v Tiffany & Company, CA2, 94-9268

Tiffany & Company abolished the position held by Mary C.
Quarantino while she was on maternity leave "as part of a
corporate reorganization." Tiffany offered Quarantino a lower
level position, which she accepted. By accepting the lower level
position, however, Quarantino lost salary, stock options and
retirement credits.

After filing a complaint with EEOC, Quarantino learned that
Tiffany had hired a "non-pregnant, unmarried woman" to perform
what she claims were essentially the same duties that she had
performed in her former position. She sued, claiming that
Tiffany's action constituted unlawful pregnancy discrimination
under Title VII.

Quarantino also alleged that although a superior, Michael Eiring,
advised that "her job would be waiting for her" when she was
ready to return to work, he also told her that "a mother should
stay home with her child." In addition, Quarantino said that she
learned that Tiffany commenced recruiting for the new position
before she left on maternity leave. She also contended that two
other women had experience work problems when they returned from
their maternity leaves.

A District Court judge ruled that Quarantino had not established
a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination and dismissed her
claim. The Circuit Court of Appeals [Second Circuit] reverse. In
reinstating her complaint, the Circuit Court said that a trial
was required because Quarantino raised a number of disputed
issues, such as the question of the "new position" created being
the equivalent of her former position and the selection of a
single woman to fill it.

The Court suggested that if Quarantino could prove such to be the
case, it might constitute evidence of Tiffany's alleged
"discriminatory animus" towards pregnant employees. Presumably
the matter will now be schedule for jury trial before a district
court judge.

HAIR LENGTH POLICY DISCRIMINATORY
Rourke v NYS Dept. of Correctional Serv., USDC NDNY 94-CV-0735

A federal district court judge ruled that the New York State
Department of Correctional Services' refusal to grant a Mohawk
Indian an exemption from its uniform hair length policy
constituted unlawful religious discrimination.

Raymond T. Rourke, a Mohawk Indian, was fired from his position
as a correction officer because he refused to cut his hair to
conform to department rules concerning hair length which required
hair to be not more than one-half inch below the top of their
shirt collar.

Rourke, who was initially appointed as a prison guard in 1989,
stopped cutting his hair in 1991 when he joined the Mohawk's
traditional Longhouse faith. He said that he discontinued the
practice of haircuts as a sign of his spirituality and religious
commitment.

Initially allowed to wear his uncut hair in a ponytail, a new
superior officer directed Rourke to confirm to the Department's
hair length policy. Although women corrections personnel may have
hair of any length and are allowed to "pin it up" during working
hours, Rourke's offer to do this was rejected. Ultimately he was
dismissed for refusing to obey an order to comply with the hair
length policy.

Rourke sued in State Court and won reinstatement. Unemployed for
two years before being reinstated, Rourke sued in federal court
to obtain punitive or compensatory damages for emotional trauma,
a remedy not available in his State action. The federal district
Court, noting that New York State's Appellate Division had
earlier decided that the State failed to demonstrate any
"legitimate state interest that would be advanced" by
accommodating Rourke's request to be exempted from the
Department's hair length policy, found the Department's action
violated Title VII and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
1993.

The district court's ruling specifically notes that the Appellate
Division already concluded that "the State had no legitimate
interest ... since the very language of the [policy] provides for
an alternative to wearing hair beyond one-half inch below the
collar for female correction officers...."

FORMER EMPLOYEES AND TITLE VII
Robinson v Shell Oil Co., CA4, 93-1562

The term "employee" in Section 704(a) of Title VII has been held to
include a former employee who files Title VII allegations that he
or she was subjected to unlawful discrimination while an
employee. Section 704(a) also makes it unlawful for an employer to
retaliate against an employee because he or she filed charges
alleging unlawful discrimination or assisted others in filing a
complaint claiming Title VII violations. A former employee,
however, may not be able to bring a Title VII action based on
allegations of retaliatory actions by his or her former employer
in some circumstances.

In Robinson v Shell Oil Co., a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed a district court's dismissal of a Title VII action
charging that Shell Oil had given a former employee a "bad
reference" in retaliation for his filing a Title VII complaint
against Shell. Robinson, claiming that Shell had fired him
because of his race, filed a Title VII complaint. Robinson then
applied for a job with another company while his charges against
Shell were still pending.

Robinson's prospective employer contacted Shell for a reference.
When Robinson didn't get the job he applied for, he filed a
complaint contending that Shell had given him a negative
reference in retaliation for his having filed Title VII charges
against the company.

The Court decided that Title VII's definition of "employee"  does
not include former employees where the charges of alleged
discriminatory actions, including alleged retaliation, involved
events that occurred after the individual stopped working for the
former employer.

AGE DISCRIMINATION
Fitzpatrick v Town of Huntington, USDC, EDNY, Civ 93-2670

Joseph Fitzpatrick sued the Town of Huntington, N.Y. contending
that it had unlawfully discriminated against him because of his
age. Fitzpatrick was initially appointed as a temporary employee
in 1986 at the age of 51. Six years later he was terminated.

Fitzpatrick claimed that 61 temporary workers were permanently
appointed to positions with the Town during the six period during
which he was an employee. Of the 61, 60 were younger than
Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick argued that he was denied permanent
appointment simply because of his age.

A jury found the Town had unlawfully discriminated against
Fitzpatrick because of his age. It awarded him $187,500. Because
the jury found that Huntington's violation was willful, the
federal district court judge is permitted to double the award for
damages.

MANAGING THE THREAT
OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE

Preventing workplace violence is a critical security function, but
all too often management finds itself scrambling to contain the
damage from workplace incidents, rather than preventing them
before they start.

Workplace violence rarely springs out of nowhere. Nearly all
employer-directed cases of violence begin with a verbal or
physical threat--threats that a well-structured "threat-
management" policy should be able to avert.

Start by putting together a multidisciplinary threat-management
team, says Dennis Johnson, president of Behavior Analysts &
Consultants, Inc., of Stuart, Fla., which conducts corporate
training on managing workplace violence. "Include people who
are trained in workplace violence issues and know the dynamics
of threat management and intervention." A representative team
could include professionals from the security, safety, human
resources, legal, labor relations and medical functions.

The team may also include outside psychologists, consultants,
facilities specialists, or public relations and employee assistance
professionals. This group is responsible for assessing and
managing workplace threats and developing general policy and
procedures.

Most threat-management teams will want to appoint a group
leader, preferably someone with a history of dealing with threats
and security vulnerability. Often the group leader is the security
manager or a human resource expert, says Johnson, coauthor of
Breaking Point: The Workplace Violence Epidemic and What to
Do About It (National Safe Workplace Institute).

Threat management involves two types of assessments--a needs
assessment and a behavioral assessment. The team must be
prepared to evaluate and manage security threats for both. The
needs assessment includes a survey of all physical facilities,
security systems, access authorization programs and any existing
policies relating to security issues.

"You want to assess security vulnerability in terms of the
corporate assets you're looking to protect, past security incidents
and the prevailing environment and social conditions in your
particular industry and community," says Johnson.

For example, "an industry in a high-crime area with lots of
neighborhood violence will affect the attitudes of your workers,"
Johnson says. "Given your labor pool, some employees may
believe that violence is a legitimate form of expressing workplace
frustration."

Significant downsizing also increases your vulnerability. In a
study of 125 workplace homicides, Johnson's firm found that half
of the perpetrators had recently been laid off or terminated in a
downsizing effort.

"Because the lives of so many people--especially men--are
grounded in their jobs, the possibility of losing that anchor in an
economy in which replacement jobs are scarce creates
unbearable stress. That stress may manifest itself in violent
behavior," Johnson says.

Once the critical risk factors are identified, the team should
establish links with outside support functions, such as hospitals,
law enforcement and EAP counselors.

Basically, the needs assessment helps you determine the
readiness of key players to react effectively to specific situations.
For example, asks Johnson "If your beeper goes off, and you
learn that there's a single male perpetrator with multiple
handguns holding your office manager hostage, are you prepared
to handle it? Do you have a plan in place?"

BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT

The behavioral assessment looks at actual incidents or scenarios
of threatening behavior and at the perpetrators themselves. It
evaluates the potential "triggers" that could turn a manageable
threat into violent aggression.

At this stage, the threat-management team  should determine
the circumstances of an incident; whether previous incidents
have occurred; whether the action reflects a pattern; and
whether the person has incurred particular stresses recently
(such as a divorce, a layoff, a death in the family).

"Whenever a person engages in violent behavior, he or she has
chosen aggression over other alternatives," Johnson notes. To
understand what led to that choice, the violence should be
considered in terms of the contributing factors.

In framing the specific threat-management policy, the group
must determine the extent to which supervisors and employees
will receive training in such areas as conflict resolution, stress
management, employee counseling, dealing with difficult people,
etc.

"Many companies believe that controlling workplace violence is
everyone's responsibility and thus choose to extend awareness
training to all employees," Johnson says.

Johnson suggests combining threat management with other
policies, such as Fitness for Duty or Drug-Free Workplace
statements. Johnson favors a catchall "Fair Treatment for
Others" policy, because it can address the importance of
respecting differences in religious, philosophical or personal
beliefs--any of which may trigger aggression.

Without exception, every policy must clearly establish a zero
tolerance for threatening behaviors, and Johnson emphasizes
that it be conveyed in both writing and in practice. "It doesn't
matter if it's a verbalized threat, an emotional outburst,
unwanted romantic overtures or physical intimidation. Any
conduct that has the potential to harm or interfere with the
actions of others should be investigated."

Why? Because beyond an actual threat is the perception of what
the company considers threatening. If employees witness and
report threatening behavior, but management takes no action to
stop it, "people may start to think that grabbing or harassing is a
legitimate form of conflict resolution."

Many times there is no real danger--men often slap each other
on the back, for example, but if a male employee who's had a
hard day shoves a female co-worker, or blows up at her in the
parking lot, it may be another story. Perhaps the two know each
other and the particular situation is harmless.

Still, Johnson encourages talking to all individuals involved in a
reported incident, including any third-party witnesses, "so that
employees realize what is and is not appropriate workplace
behavior."

The threat-management plan should spell out who  receives
reports of threatening behavior (often this is the direct
supervisor or the security manager) and how those reports are
delivered--in person, in writing, via a phone call to a outside
hotline, etc. "The method for handling complaints varies among
companies, depending on the corporate culture," says Johnson.

The plan should also outline procedures for recognizing
potentially threatening behavior. Red flags include chronic
absenteeism, erratic work patterns, difficulty meeting deadlines,
notable changes in personal appearance or conduct, unwarranted
anger or irritability and difficulty accepting criticism. The
frequency, duration and effect of the behavioral change may all
affect the perception of its seriousness. Nonetheless, all
questionable behaviors warrant close monitoring.

If, upon evaluation, you decide that action is required, many
companies will bring in an independent, unbiased consultant to
conduct a "dangerousness assessment," says Johnson. That
process monitors warning signs and can pinpoint whether there
is a clear and immediate threat to identifiable targets.

ATTITUDE SURVEYS

Attitude surveys are a relatively benign way to gauge employees'
perceptions of the organization. "They're a kind of 'early-warning
system' that reveals trends and changes in the mood and
behavior of employees," Johnson says. Surveys involve one-on-
one, confidential interviews ("usually 20- to 40-minutes") with
randomly selected employees. Some employees are also asked to
fill out confidential questionnaires.

"Attitude surveys help us tap into attitudes and show what
barriers or constraints exist in the workplace. They help identify
strengths and weaknesses, and we often can find out if there are
any illegal or unprofessional practices, as well as general security
vulnerabilities."

Johnson claims that in more than a decade of working with
threat-management programs, his firm has never yet conducted
an attitude survey that did not lead to substantive change. He
encourages companies to share feedback from the surveys with
employees, who often can help solve internal problems and
analyze what might be done to achieve a safer work
environment.

 The goal, Johnson says, is to generate two-way communication
and to help people learn to recognize and deal with signs of
trouble before they escalate out of control.

WORKPLACE HOMICIDES IN 1992

A new analysis of deaths in the workplace finds homicide
accounts for close to one in five of all on-the-job fatalities.
Based on the 1992 nationwide Census of Fatal Occupational
Injuries, the analysis by Janice Windau and Guy Toscano of the
Office of Safety, Health and Working Conditions at the Bureau
of Labor Statistics found:
  *  Homicide accounted for 17
percent of the 6,083 fatal work injuries in 1992. More than half
the victims were 25 to 34 years old.
  *  Male workers comprised 83 percent of the 1,004 victims of
homicide. For men, homicide ranked just behind motor vehicle
accidents in the number of work-related fatalities. For women,
homicide was the leading cause of death.
  *  Most homicides resulted from gunshot wounds during a
robbery attempt between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. Robberies often
occurred while  employees were locking up at night or making
money drops or pickups.
  *  Business disputes accounted for 261 deaths, 45 of which
involved a current or former co-worker, and 35 of which
involved a customer or client.
  *  Workplace homicide is primarily an urban problem, with
nearly half of the incidents occurring in the retail trade.
Convenience stores, restaurants, bars and gas stations were
hardest hit. One-sixth of the homicides occurred in service
industries, including guard and armored-car services, hotels and
motels, and health and educational services. Taxicab companies
and police protection also were  affected.
  *  Occupations incurring 50 or more homicides in 1992
included supervisors and sales proprietors, taxicab drivers and
chauffeurs, cashiers, managers of food and lodging
establishments, food preparation and service occupations, police
and detectives, and private guards.

INFORMATION NETWORKS FACE MOUNTING HACKER
INTRUSION

Few corporate communications networks are safe from
electronic intrusion. Hackers who once engaged in mere high-
tech mischief are now probing new digital communications
technologies for flaws that may yield big financial gains.

However, private network operators and telecommunications
companies can take steps to close security loopholes, according
to network security experts speaking  at the International Virus
Prevention and Information Security Conference, sponsored by
the National Computer Security Association in Arlington, Va.,
March 31.

Ted S. Phillips, a telecommunications security associate at Booz,
Allen & Hamilton Inc., believes domestic and international
telecommunications companies and long-distance carrier
networks are increasingly at risk for computer crimes. Open-
systems architecture such as Signalling System 7 and advanced
intelligent network technology are also vulnerable. In the new
systems, carriers and users share responsibility for
administration, network elements interconnect, and customer-
premises equipment ties more closely to the public switched
network, all of which heighten network vulnerability.

To an intruder, multiple points of entry into telecommunications
networks "raises the number of attack vectors," Phillips says.
"Hackers can easily enter a company's system via an X.25
network or a dial-in modem."

Once inside the system, hackers can disrupt network service and
obtain or modify data. In extreme cases, they have been known
to steal communications equipment and software manuals from
company premises and use confidential data for extortion or
fraud. However they compromise a system, hackers cause
companies to lose revenue and investor confidence, and may
even threaten public security by tampering with emergency
services communications. Yet hackers rarely destroy the systems
they have entered. They "want to keep systems up and running,"
Phillips says, so they can continue to grab information and
remain inconspicuous.

SMOOTH OPERATORS GLEAN VALUABLE PASSWORDS

Phillips notes that hackers often obtain their best information by
"social engineering"--basically, smooth talking office personnel
into releasing passwords and access codes. "This is a real threat"
to security systems, he says, but there are ways of protecting
systems.

"Keep control of internal 'phone books' that list passwords,"
Phillips advises. "Shred documents that contain access codes.
Train secretaries to question people who walk in the door asking
for information. And put locks on your dumpsters." Believe it or
not, trash bins are prime targets for hackers seeking manuals
and documents that contain sensitive information.

Also speaking at the conference, Hank M. Kluepfel, managing
director for government accounts at Bellcore, encouraged system
users to discard easily discernible passwords based on common
names and to use combinations of alpha and numeric characters
instead.

For example, a user named Mary Elizabeth could use the
corresponding numbers on touch-tone telephone keys for the
name "Beth," plus the letter J for the month of her birthdate-
-2384J--or the corresponding letters for her house address, plus
the number 2 for her two children, for example.

Companies can further minimize the risk of intrusion by creating
security guidelines and responsible safeguards for staff. "Let your
employees know what is expected of them and how the system
works," Kluepfel says. He adds that many companies keep their
employees in the dark about security for fear that a disgruntled
but knowledgeable employee will wreak havoc on the system. Or,
they fail to penalize employees who ignore simple guidelines.
Kluepfel also urged companies and telecommunications
providers to exchange information on hackers and their tactics.

Companies should also demand better security from equipment
vendors. "Let vendors know what you expect," Kluepfel says.
Customer input will force equipment vendors to put security
concerns into the product development stage, and will help
companies avoid the time and often damaging expense of
implementing such mechanisms retroactively.

When operating a network, Kluepfel advises companies to "think
like a hacker" by noting the most secure and the most vulnerable
locations in a system, as well as the most valuable information,
which is most likely to be stolen if not protected.

TACO BELL IN HOT SALSA OVER HOLD-UP

After Claudia Piagentini was fired for refusing to report for her
night shift after a robber held a gun to her head at a Northern
California franchise, she sued Taco Bell for failing to provide a
safe workplace.

The woman's suit contends that her boss agreed she could come
off the night shift and work days for one month after the
midnight robbery in March of 1993. But management changed
its mind  later and told her to report as usual.

Piagentini said she couldn't comply, as she was still too shaken
up from the trauma of looking down a gun barrel. She was fired
for her willful misconduct. The suit asks that the franchise
owner, Dolan Foster Enterprise, Inc., be ordered to pay
Piagentini's lost wages and an unspecified amount for failing to
provide a safe workplace.

BODYGUARDS: PERSONAL PROTECTION ON THE RISE

Being a bodyguard means expecting the unexpected, whether it's
protecting business executives and political figures, or ushering
movie stars and sports heros through swarming paparazzi. Job
duties may include hovering nearby through interminable
meetings, elbowing paths through bustling airports, attending
high-profile parties, stoically keeping watch through long nights
without sleeping, chauffering protectees around town, even
running errands that ought to fall under someone else's job
description, but don't. It's a job that offers some excitement--and
a lot of boredom.

Large cities naturally have the greatest call for bodyguards--New
York City, Los Angeles and Washington, followed by Chicago,
tend to require the most, says Richard Ward, a former New
York City detective, now a chancellor at the University of
Illinois at Chicago. "You've got sports figures, entertainment
people, organized crime figures who require [protection], and
business people with money who feel they need someone around
them."

Ed Scheu of Thompson Professional Services in Chicago,
recently guarded an executive whose company had laid off
several hundred employees. "He was the No. 2 man with the
company. He had gotten multiple threats, letters, phone calls to
his house," recalls Scheu. "One of them said to his wife, 'We're
going to get that [expletive] you're married to.'"

With workplace violence rising, so will the perceived need for
bodyguards, predicts Scheu. Where does one go to find a
bodyguard? Word of mouth, the Yellow Pages and newspapers
are good places to start. Many companies that sell or
manufacture security alarms, such as ADT or Honeywell, can
also recommend protection services. However, "most CEOs and
corporate presidents have a known network they can call on for
protection," says Scheu. "A lot of paranoia prevails in these
upper echelons; once one has been threatened, he lets the others
know and it heightens the paranoia."

Bodyguards come from all walks of life: former FBI or Secret
Service agents, ex-Marines, retired or moonlighting police
officers, private investigators, corporate security guards, etc.
Most are men, but increasing numbers of women are getting into
the field.

Fortunately, you need not look like Shawn Eckardt to be a
bodyguard. In fact, brains are far more desirable than brawn
(testimony to Eckardt's flub-up in "protecting" Tonya Harding).
"The most effective bodyguard is someone who's low-key,
unobstrusive and meshes with the environment," says Branch
Walton, a 21-year veteran of the Secret Service in Springfield,
Ill.

And pay? "A mug off the street will probably make from $20,000
to $30,000 a year," says Ward. "Generally, a professional is going
to make between $50,000 and $100,000."

Becoming a bodyguard requires no formal training, but would-be
protectors can pick up training tips--such as how to placate
aggressive autograph seekers or fend off would-be knee
knockers--at police departments or schools like the Executive
Protection Institute, headquartered in Berryville, Va. EPI has
branches nationwide and offers a variety of classes, including
criminal education and law enforcement litigation.

Some universities, such as the University of Illinois at Chicago,
are starting to offer short courses on personal protection and
physical security. Ward recently asked Scheu to conduct a two-
day course on security issues for Chicago-area law enforcement
personnel.

"Basically," however, Ward notes, "anyone can hang out their
shingle and say they're a bodyguard."

QUESTIONS ABOUT EVERYDAY SECURITY PROBLEMS

Q:  Can old electronic communications can be used against us?
My bank terminated an employee for stealing money, but she
claims she found a year-old e-mail message that defames her
character and reads "Get rid of her." Are we required to let
investigators search our computer disks and backup tapes?
A:  Yes, if you are sued or formally charged with criminal
violations, a court order can force you to open your electronic
files. Your former employee has a tough case to prove, but
"attorneys are starting to aggressively target electronic data," says
John Jessen, of Electronic Evidence Discovery, a Seattle
investigation firm.

Electronic mail should not be considered a secure medium for
sharing sensitive data about company plans and actions. Jessen
has worked on cases in which investigators recovered supposedly
deleted e-mail messages that used descriptive expletives to attack
employees' personalities instead of their work performance. In
one instance, the plaintiff settled out of court for $250,000.

In 1993, a San Francisco federal district court ruled that
companies under criminal investigation should readily provide all
company-related electronic files to prosecutors. Not turning over
files at once could be an offense itself.

Advice:  Tell employees what communications can be used
against them in court. Back up and label data carefully. And,
don't send anything via e-mail that you wouldn't broadcast over
a loudspeaker.

Q:  One of our employees has received anonymous e-mail
messages that are racist and hostile. His boss also has received
messages that criticize his managerial skills and question his
competency. Trouble is, we don't know who's sending the
messages. What can we do?

A:  Most electronic messaging software requires sender
identification, but a few products do allow anonymity. One
rationale for the new software is that unidentified messages may
promote interoffice discussion of formerly taboo topics. An
aerospace manufacturer claims it's done wonders for getting his
employees to brainstorm ideas. But the flip side is the problem
you describe.

One solution is to pull the plug on your global e-mail system and
rewrite your network software to enable tracking of all
communications. Further, at least one Fortune 1,000 company
now has a policy forbidding unidentified harassment and hostile
criticism.

Another solution is to follow the lead of Internet, the world's
most popular network for sharing electronic intimacies and
whistle-blower communiques. Internet requires a "return
address" on all messages. However, it also allows users to send
messages to a "remailer"-- a message "launderer" that strips out
the original headers and inserts its own. Perhaps an electronic
middleman is the answer.

Q:  Must offensive conduct seriously affect an employee's
psychological well-being or cause actual injury in order to be
unlawfully discriminatory? And, if so, how do we measure such
injuries?

A:  A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled late last year in
Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. that Title VII provisions come
into play long before offensive conduct leads a person to a
nervous breakdown or other serious malady. But determining the
scope of injury is less than clear. An obnoxious or insensitive
comment may give one person an annoying headache, while
sending another running to a psychiatrist for Valium. Which
victim has the stronger case?

The Court ruled that if a "reasonable person" could perceive a
work environment to be hostile or abusive, that person does not
also have to prove the conduct was psychologically harmful.
"Injurious" conduct may include attacks based on gender, race,
color, religion or national origin and, most likely, disability and
age.

Other factors that may be considered are the frequency of the
conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or
humiliating, whether it unreasonably interferes with the victim's
work, and whether it affects the victim's psychological well-being.

In light of the ruling, employers should investigate all complaints
of inappropriate conduct and may want to broaden their
harassment policies.

Q:  Our top car salesman sexually assaulted a customer while on
a test drive. He was recently convicted on criminal charges, but
the company has now been sued for negligence in hiring. The
customer claims we failed to do a pre-employment criminal
investigation, which would have shown the salesman was an
offender. Are we liable?

A:  Some courts have ruled that employers can be held liable for
an employee's actions if the company had any indication "by
reason of past conduct, bad temper or otherwise" that the person
was potentially dangerous.

However, while "a presumption exists that an employer has used
due care in hiring," most courts say that unless compelling
evidence indicates a criminal investigation is appropriate,
employers have no legal obligation to conduct such background
checks.

A North Carolina Court of Appeals dismissed a similar case,
ruling that companies cannot be held responsible for an
employee's actions that occur beyond the scope of employment
or are "designed to carry out an independent purpose." In your
case, the salesman's conducted clearly violated the bounds of his
duties and the company's expectations.

CLIPPER CHIP BATTLES STORMY SEAS

The Clinton administration's decision to approve the
controversial Clipper encryption device continues to make waves.
Clipper is a computer chip that makes telephone traffic
indecipherable to eavesdroppers, but allows the government a
"trap door" so that investigators can access decrypted Clipper
calls.

During a public comment period, the administration received
331 letters and comments; all but two criticized the technology.
Last month a poll conducted for Time Inc. and CNN found that
80 percent of the 1,000 respondents oppose Clipper and would
rather protect the privacy of phone calls than allow police to tap
wires.

The FBI insists that the optional system grants authorities access
"only when there's probable cause that there's criminal activity"
taking place on scrambled lines.

Yet at least 45,000 opponents have signed an electronic petition
against the new policy, saying they worry more about
unscrupulous public servants than they do about "bad guys"
trying to eavesdrop and/or steal data.

At one point during the recent Computers, Freedom and Privacy
Conference in Chicago, keynote speaker David A. Lytel, a White
House technology expert, looked around in exasperation and
asked, "How many people here fear they are at greater risk from
government abuses of power than criminal activity?" Most in
attendance raised their hands.

A  House-Senate panel plans hearings on the technology later
this month.

VOICE AND DATA RECOVERY

IBM Corp. and AT&T's Global Information Solutions recently
agreed to market a joint disaster recovery service for voice and
data communications. In the event of a power outage, bomb
threat, fire, severed cables or other disaster, the companies will
support each other's disaster recovery customers.

"This agreement allows us to combine AT&T's expertise in data
and voice communications with IBM's disaster recovery expertise
in the computer environment," says Bob Richards, general
manager of AT&T's business recovery group. The joint venture
will provide an "efficient and economical way to offer complete
disaster recovery services."

Both companies will have 24-hour access to the other's business
recovery centers. IBM has 17 U.S. recovery sites offering
equipment, advanced telecommunications support and specialists
in networking, systems management and programming.

AT&T currently has a single crisis center in Rochelle Park, N.J.,
the first of several sites planned. In the event of disaster,
metropolitan New York City customers can relocate their
employees and critical business functions to the facility within
two to four hours, where they're provided 200 computer-ready
workstations, desks and phones.

The service allows for fully restored voice and data
communications, round-the-clock access to stored records, plus
vault storage for secure, off-site data storage.

PERSONAL SECURITY ALERT

Safe & Sound Homecare Inc. of  Lincoln, Neb. has developed a
wireless, portable security sensor that can quietly warn a security
manager of a remote perimeter violation. The system consists of
a cordless motion detector that fits any door jam, a plug-in
transmitter /recharger and a small personal pager that beeps or
vibrates when activated and conveniently clips to a belt or fits in
a pocket.

The sensor trips a remote alarm, so the security violator is not
alerted, and the appearance of security personnel seems
coincidental. The portable system can be moved within a facility
as needed. The base unit plugs into any standard electrical outlet
and installs in  minutes. Originally designed for keeping track of
small children or the elderly, the system has practical business
purposes as well. $1,995 per unit. For more information, call
800/328-0526.

PROTECT YOUR FAXES, ETC.

As the need to scramble and encrypt phone and fax messages
increases, so does the security risk  of computer modems. Given
the ease with which a line's integrity can be compromised, all
data transmitting over that line represents a possible loss.

Discreet Electronics and Security Inc. of Chicago has developed
an encryption device that involves installing a small box on the
sender's and  the receiver's line ( phone, fax or modem).

The user "signs in" to establish a link with the receiver. When
activated, the device randomly generates encryption codes that
change every 1/10th of a second. Vault security is also available
to ensure specific parties receive private messages. Depending
on the level of security and the type of communication system,
prices range from $2,000-$4,000 per package. Contact Michael
Pinsker, 312/664-7797.

ONDCP PRESSURES HHS
FOR INTERPRETATION OF LAB RULE

The Office of National Drug Control Policy has called on
the Department of Health and Human Services for a quick
resolution to the controversy over the potential
regulation of private sector drug testing in the
department's new clinical laboratory rule, DRUG DETECTION
REPORT has learned.

The request came outside of the formal comment process on
HHS's final rule implementing the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and was meant to
draw HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan into the dispute over
CLIA's application to drug testing, according to a
federal official familiar with the letter.

The letter made no demands on HHS about how to apply the
CLIA rule but asked for "an expedited legal
interpretation" of its application to drug testing, said
the official, who asked not to be identified. ONDCP
Director Bob Martinez is not involved in the CLIA issue
at this point but could enter the fray once ONDCP
receives an answer from HHS, the official said.

Mr. Martinez' involvement would not be necessary if HHS
decides not to apply CLIA to private sector drug testing,
but HHS officials maintain that, as of now, such testing
is covered by the rule. CLIA requires that all labs
conducting clinical tests "for the assessment of health"
be certified by HHS. Based on a number of comments so far
made public, there is a widespread belief that
application of CLIA to private sector drug testing could
inhibit on-site testing and result in higher costs to
employers.

The ONDCP letter was written by Bruce M. Carnes, ONDCP's
director of planning, budget, and administration, to Mark
Barnes, Sullivan's special counsel on drug abuse policy.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Carnes declined to release the
text of the letter or to comment on its contents. Mr.
Barnes also declined to comment directly on the letter,
but acknowledged that ONDCP had "communicated to us
within the normal process of interagency communications"
about CLIA.

However, Barnes indicated that HHS is unlikely to
expedite a resolution of the drug testing question,
saying that the department will publish a "final final
rule" by Sept. 1, the date CLIA is to take effect.
Another HHS official confirmed the Sept. 1 target date
for resolution of the drug testing issue and indicated
that officials and agencies within HHS are not in
agreement on whether and to what extent CLIA should
regulate drug testing.

One potential resolution under consideration, according
to officials within HHS, would be to redefine private
sector drug testing as "forensic" in nature. As published
Feb. 28, the CLIA rule exempts from coverage forensic
testing, defined as tests conducted to determine the
subject's legal status rather than health condition.
However, drug testing advocates and regulators, including
the National Institute on Drug Abuse, routinely refer to
all drug testing as forensic. Adopting the broader
definition could be a relatively easy way to settle the
question.

Any change in the department's current interpretation of
CLIA will most likely be published in the Federal
Register, HHS officials said. However, one official
refused to rule out the possibility that the rule could
be reinterpreted without a formal published notice.

In addition to the letter from Carnes, ONDCP submitted
formal comments on CLIA to the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), the HHS agency implementing the
rule. In the comments, Frank M. Kalder, director of the
budget and legislative review staff, chided HHS for not
consulting ONDCP about CLIA's potential application to
drug testing and warned that the rule could adversely
affect drug treatment programs and small employers.

"It appears that under the CLIA interpretation of
permissible drug testing, alcohol and drug treatment
facilities would be prohibited from conducting routine
on-site drug testing to monitor patient drug use," Mr.
Kalder wrote. "In addition, we also are concerned that
these rules will make the process very complex and
expensive, and thus, may cause many employers to
discontinue their drug testing programs."

Kalder asked HCFA to explain why an exemption of
employment and insurance screening contained in a
November 1991 draft of the rule was dropped in the
published document, and said "ONDCP believes the
exemptions should be reinstated."

He also asked for a "legal interpretation" of CLIA's
applicability to drug testing and its definition of
"forensic testing," and asked for an assessment of the
cost to businesses that would need certification should
HHS continue to apply CLIA to drug testing.

In other comments, Byron Lee Jr., president and chief
executive officer of the Nuclear Management and Resources
Council (NUMARC), a group of nuclear power companies,
expressed concern that CLIA might cover on-site testing
under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
fitness-for-duty program. He said the tests should fall
under CLIA's definition of forensic because they are
conducted to detect violations of law.

"During the past two years, over one-half million urine
samples have been collected by the nation's nuclear
utilities for these testing purposes only, not for
clinical treatment, medical diagnosis, health assessment,
or disease prevention," Lee wrote. "Nuclear power
industry drug testing should be considered forensic
testing since it is performed to determine if a federal
regulation has been violated."

Dr. Brock Wisenberger, director of corporate employee
health for Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park, Ill.,
agreed. "The assessment of abused and/or illegal
substances as part of a Corporate Drug-Free Workplace
program is identical in purpose to drug testing performed
by law enforcement agencies to determine whether there
has been a violation of the law," he said.

Rep. Bill Lowery (R-Calif.) requested that all private
sector drug testing be exempted from CLIA. "It is my
belief that the purpose of drug testing for employment
purposes is not to provide results for diagnosis or
treatment of an individual, but to comply with corporate
drug abuse policies," he wrote. Regulating drug testing
through CLIA would "seriously impede" the Bush
Administration's drug control strategy, he said.

Not every comment on drug testing was opposed to its
regulation by CLIA. The American Hospital Association's
senior vice president for policy, Dr. James D. Bentley,
said employment and insurance screening should be covered
by CLIA because they are for "assessment of health."

And the American Clinical Laboratory Association
recommended that enzyme immunoassays (EIA) be
reclassified from moderately complex to highly complex.
Such a change would impose more stringent standards and
personnel requirements on EIA tests.

TWO GROUPS REACH PACT FOR
STANDARD MRO CERTIFICATIONS

Two medical professional organizations have reached a
tentative agreement to create a standardized
accreditation process for medical review officers,
according to officials of both organizations.

Once carried out, the agreement would avoid a potentially
confusing situation in which competing organizations
would be promoting their own ethical standards and
certifying processes for MROs, who review test results in
federally mandated drug testing programs.

The agreement was reached May 4 by representatives of the
American College of Occupational and Environmental
Medicine, a physicians' group established in 1916, and
the American Association of Medical Review Officers,
established last year to promote MRO standards. AAMRO
began conducting certifying examinations for MROs in
March, and ACOEM was scheduled to begin its own testing
program this fall.

Under the agreement, a new organization (yet to be named)
will be formed to administer the MRO certifying process.
The two organizations still need to negotiate a "common
document" of MRO standards, but have agreed to pool
questions from their own certifying exams to create a new
test, according to Dr. Kent Peterson, treasurer of ACOEM
and chairman of its MRO training course. "It's going to
be a tough exam," he said.

Initially, the organization will be governed by
representatives of both ACOEM and AAMRO, but other
medical groups will be invited to participate, Dr.
Peterson said. The new organization will be located at
ACOEM's headquarters in Arlington Heights, Ill., and
should begin operating by July 1, he added.

The agreement firmly establishes the fledgling AAMRO in
the ranks of professional medical organizations. Dr.
Peterson said AAMRO "showed leadership" on the issue of
establishing MRO standards and certification procedures.
He denied reports that ACOEM had been reluctant to work
with AAMRO, saying only that "ACOEM's position has always
been that the credentialing of physicians should be in
the hands of a professional organization."

Dr. Steven St. Clair, AAMRO's executive director, said
the negotiations "were not tense, though there was a lot
of misunderstanding about what each other was doing"
about MRO certification. "Once we sat down at the table,
the misconceptions were dealt with pretty easily," he
said.

Dr. St. Clair said federal drug testing officials, many
of whom sit on AAMRO's federal advisory board, "have
expressed uniform enthusiasm" about the agreement. "This
effort was largely created because of concerns expressed
by federal regulators and individual MROs about the
possibility of having more than one standard that might
have developed had the two organizations continued
separately."

Dr. Peterson echoed that point. "We felt the benefits of
a common procedure far outweighed the tendency of both
groups to pursue their own programs," he said.

Dr. St. Clair said MROs already certified by AAMRO will
automatically receive certification by the new
organization.

DOT WEIGHS ZERO TOLERANCE
POLICY ON ALCOHOL TESTING

Federal officials are debating what cutoff levels the
Department of Transportation should use for its alcohol
testing regulation, with some pushing for "zero
tolerance" and others arguing that a hard-line approach
could be perceived as a "witch hunt," according to a
senior DOT official.

Some officials favor penalizing transportation workers
who are found to have any traces of alcohol in their
systems, while others propose pegging the department's
regulation with standard drunk driving cutoffs, which are
usually 0.08 percent or 0.1 percent blood-alcohol
content, according to Dr. Donna R. Smith, senior program
analyst in DOT's drug enforcement and program compliance
office.

The department is developing the alcohol testing rule to
implement the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act
of 1991, signed by President Bush last October.

Dr. Smith discussed DOT's rulemaking deliberations at a
May 16 meeting of the Substance Abuse Program
Administrators Association in Crystal City, Va., and in
an interview with DRUG DETECTION REPORT.

She said some DOT officials--supported by the National
Transportation Safety Board, an agency independent of
DOT, and the National Institute on Alcoholism, part of
the Department of Health and Human Services--favor a
"zero tolerance" approach. Other officials fear the
American public might see such a tough line as a "witch
hunt" or "a new Prohibition" and advocate adopting the
more tolerant drunk driving standard to minimize the risk
of legal challenges, she said.

The department is sensitive to the political issues
because "alcohol is America's favorite legal drug," and
believes that because alcohol consumption is legal, the
cutoff levels should be tied as closely as possible to
impairment, Dr. Smith said. "We can't necessarily prove
that mere presence of alcohol causes risks," she said,
explaining potential drawbacks to a zero cutoff.

"We cannot say that a person who consumes alcohol by that
very consumption is a risk in a safety-sensitive
position," Dr. Smith said. "We can say a person who
drinks while or just before performing safety-sensitive
duties is a risk. We need to establish a nexus of
impairment."

Because of the perceived need to link alcohol testing to
impairment, cutoff levels of 0.04 percent or 0.02 percent
are also under consideration because of research
indicating measurable impairment at those levels, she
said.

The Bush Administration has not taken a position in the
debate, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy is
not advocating a particular cutoff level, she said.

The decision on which cutoff level to use will affect
more than the public's perception of the alcohol testing
program--it will also influence the department's choice
of testing methodology, Dr. Smith said. That choice has
been a tough one for department officials because each
potential method--saliva, blood, breath, and urine--has
its own advantages and drawbacks, she said.

For example, a zero cutoff would effectively rule out
saliva testing, which is potentially effective at 0.04
percent but not sensitive enough at zero, she said. At
the higher cutoff, saliva tests could be an easy and
cost-efficient screening device, but they have no
forensic track record, have not withstood court
challenges, and the connection between alcohol content in
a person's saliva and a person's blood remains
"theoretical," she said.

Blood is "the gold standard" in forensic testing, able to
detect trace amounts of alcohol, "but in workplace random
testing, blood is unattractive" because it is invasive
and expensive, Dr. Smith said. Breath testing meets
forensic standards but "is by no means cheap," she said.

In addition, breath testing combines in one device and
one operator the specimen collection, laboratory
analysis, and medical review functions the department
purposely separates in its drug testing program to
maintain objectivity.

Finally, urine testing for alcohol has the same potential
drawback as the zero cutoff level--it cannot demonstrate
that the person is impaired at the time of the test.

The decisions on cutoff levels and testing methods must
be made soon, for Transportation Secretary Andrew Card
plans to have a final rule in effect before the Oct. 28
deadline, Dr. Smith said. The department still hopes to
publish its proposed rule before the end of June, she
added.

ROADSIDE TESTING PROJECT
COULD BE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE

The Department of Transportation's pilot project on
roadside drug and alcohol testing could begin as early as
late August, more than three months ahead of schedule,
according to Dr. Donna R. Smith, senior analyst with
DOT's drug enforcement and program compliance office.

The department recently chose four states--Utah,
Minnesota, Nebraska, and New Jersey--to implement the
program, which is meant to discover if random testing
that is not employer-based can be conducted in an
effective and cost-efficient manner, Dr. Smith told DRUG
DETECTION REPORT. Congress mandated the one-year, $5
million project as part of the Omnibus Transportation
Employee Testing Act of 1991, but the project is
proceeding independently of the department's rulemaking
on that legislation.

According to the legislation, implementation of the pilot
programs is to begin no later than January 1993. However,
Dr. Smith said, some of the states have indicated they
could begin testing as early as August.

Dr. Smith said each of the four states will develop its
own testing plan, including locations and methodology of
testing, so the department will have four separate
experiences to evaluate. She said the programs could
include on-site drug and alcohol screening or traditional
specimen collection, depending on what the states
propose. DOT is considering whether to have the states
contract individually with laboratories to perform the
tests or to have all four programs use one laboratory
selected by the department, she said.

Employers could save a lot of money if the responsibility
for drug testing is taken over by states, and Dr. Smith
indicated that one important objective of the pilot
program is to calculate the expense of roadside testing.
However, interest in roadside testing is not great among
state governments--only six submitted applications for
the pilot program, Dr. Smith said.

The department is particularly concerned that truckers
might easily be able to avoid the tests, she said. State
implementation plans will have to address means of
preventing truckers from informing each other about test
times and locations, taking alternate routes to avoid
testing sites, or "congregating at previous truck stops"
to avoid areas where tests are being conducted, she said.

OMB APPROVES STANDARD
CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY FORM

Federal agencies conducting urine drug testing programs
will soon be required to use a standardized
chain-of-custody form, according to Dr. Joseph H. Autry
III, director of applied research at the National
Institute on Drug Abuse.

NIDA and the Department of Transportation developed the
standardized form to simplify the specimen collection
process and reduce the number of errors that cause tests
to be canceled. Currently, the government specifies what
information is to be contained on chain-of-custody forms
but allows labs and agencies to develop their own
documents. That has led to confusion among
collection-site personnel, who frequently must use
several different forms depending on which agency or lab
was doing the testing.

The standard form received approval from the Office of
Management and Budget early this month, Dr. Autry told
DRUG DETECTION REPORT. Agencies will be notified of the
new requirement in a Federal Register notice, and any
agency wishing to use a different form will need OMB
approval, he said.

The form will also be required in all DOT-regulated drug
testing, according to Dr. Donna R. Smith, senior analyst
with the department's drug enforcement and program
compliance office. The form includes a notice that the
test is conducted according to federal guidelines and
regulations, as well as a Privacy Act statement for
federal employees, she said. The Privacy Act statement
will not apply to DOT testing.

Dr. Smith said OMB so far has approved the form only for
federal employee testing, but that the department will
submit the requirement as part of its proposed rule on
the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991.
Since OMB has already approved the form once, the
department expects no problems getting it through OMB
again, she said.

Companies will not be authorized to use the form for
testing not conducted under DOT regulations because the
form certifies that the test was conducted "in accordance
with applicable Federal regulations." However, companies
could adapt the form as a model for their own programs,
Dr. Autry said.

"I'd like to see the private sector take that form and
strip off the Privacy Act part and the federal identifier
and use that as a uniform document for all drug testing.
That would make life a lot easier for the labs."

NIDA ALLOWS MRO'S TO REQUEST
CODEINE LEVEL BELOW CUTOFF

Medical review officers may request from labs the
quantitative levels for codeine on specimens reported
positive for morphine only, the National Institute on
Drug Abuse informed laboratories in April. The additional
information could help MROs determine whether positive
morphine tests received from labs should be reported to
employers as positives.

NIDA's instructions on MRO's receiving the codeine
information were contained in an April 9 advisory sent to
directors of NIDA-certified laboratories and all
inspectors within the National Laboratory Certification
Program.

MROs are normally not allowed to request quantitative
data below the cutoffs, but information on the presence
of codeine could help the MRO determine whether the test
subject was perhaps using codeine legitimately, according
to Dr. Donna Bush, chief of NIDA's drug testing section.
This is because codeine metabolizes to morphine in the
body, but some codeine is often found in the urine as
well, she said.

"What the MRO is looking for is any evidence of codeine
to try to support use of codeine as opposed to morphine
by itself," she explained.

Laboratories are authorized to release quantitative
codeine levels below cutoffs only in writing after
receiving a written request from the MRO, and only when
the codeine level is above the lab's limit of detection
and limit of quantification criteria, the advisory said.

In the advisory, NIDA also urged inspectors to "avoid
confrontation" and "maintain objectivity" in their
dealings with laboratory officials.

This was at least the second attempt by NIDA to defuse
tensions within its certification program. An Oct. 18,
1991, advisory referred to "an occasional emotional
moment" caused by "over-aggressive inspector behavior"
and reminded inspectors to "practice the highest
standards of professionalism and objectivity."

Tensions arise because inspectors--many of whom are
themselves laboratory officials--often have very definite
views about how best to fulfill NIDA's mandatory
laboratory guidelines, Dr. Bush said. These views will
differ, she said, because the guidelines establish
minimum standards without specifying how they are to be
met.

The latest advisory reminds inspectors that they are
"fact finders" who should "focus on adequacy, not
excellence; maintain objectivity; gather information;
inspect, do not suggest; ask questions when clarification
is needed; respect proprietary rights; handle conflicts;
[and] avoid confrontation."

One contentious issue during inspections has been which
lab personnel should have access to the area where the
lab receives and processes urine specimens, the advisory
indicated. NIDA said there is "no definitive answer" to
that question because laboratory size, staffing, and
workloads differ.

"It appears that this will be a dynamic and arguable
area," the advisory said. "Inspectors must continue to
make objective observations and assessments...and clearly
express their evaluation in the report. This is one area
where preconceived opinions are not desirable. This is
also an area where [inspection] team discussion and
explanation by the laboratory staff is usually
beneficial."

The advisory also contained several points regarding
chain-of-custody documentation for NIDA-regulated drug
testing. Improperly completed forms are the leading cause
of drug tests being canceled, according to federal
officials.

* Copy 3 of the chain-of-custody form, which goes from
the collection site to the MRO, must not pass through the
laboratory, even in sealed envelopes.

* Laboratories must document the condition of specimen
bottle seals on Copy 2 of the chain-of-custody document
(from lab to the MRO). If the lab reports to the MRO
electronically via computer, it may not use default
settings indicating the seal was intact, since an
oversight could improperly inform the MRO that the seal
was acceptable. A separate entry must be made for each
seal.

* Although "brevity and simplicity are desirable" in
chain-of-custody documentation, the record must "present
a clear picture of the location of the specimen/aliquot
at all times to third parties. Only then does a
[chain-of-custody] document fulfill the definition and
serve its purpose for review, scrutiny, or challenge."

ONE IN FOUR LAW AGENCIES
TESTED APPLICANTS IN 1990

One-quarter of the nation's police and sheriffs'
departments required drug tests of all applicants for
sworn officer positions in 1990, but only 2 percent
required tests of all regular field officers, according
to a new report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The report, which included 1990 data from 11,800 local
law enforcement agencies, found that drug testing was
more common in police departments than sheriffs'
departments, and in departments serving large populations
than smaller ones. For example, 79 percent of police
departments serving populations of 1 million or more
people required drug tests of all applicants, while only
14 percent of police departments serving 2,500 or fewer
did so.

Random testing of regular field officers was required by
4 percent of all local agencies, but by 21 percent of
police departments serving 1 million or more people. The
survey said 17 percent of all sworn police officers and
12 percent of sworn sheriffs' officers were subject to
random testing. Random testing was most common for
officers in drug-related positions employed by police
departments serving a population of 1 million or more (36
percent).

Reasonable suspicion tests were more common. One in every
10 agencies conducted such tests, covering 50 percent of
sworn police officers and 31 percent of sheriffs'
officers. Of civilian personnel, 45 percent in police
departments and 30 percent in sheriffs' departments were
subject to reasonable suspicion testing.

Sixty-three percent of the local agencies listed
dismissal as the most serious discipline for a first
positive drug test, with 14 percent listing suspension.
After two positives, 94 percent listed dismissal as their
most serious sanction, and only 2 percent said they stop
at suspension.

Nearly half (47 percent) of the agencies said they offer
nonprobationary officers treatment after a positive drug
test. However, the larger police departments (1 million
or more population) were least likely to offer treatment
(20 percent).

Nearly 40 percent of the local police and sheriffs'
departments reported that at least some of their
arrestees were tested for illegal drugs. Such testing was
most common in police departments serving populations of
500,000 or more (56 percent) and in sheriffs' departments
serving 1 million or more (60 percent).

"Drug Enforcement by Police and Sheriffs' Departments,
1990," (NCJ-134505), a 10-page report, is available
through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service,
Box 6000, Rockville MD 20850. (800) 732-3277; (301)

Congressional conferees approved legislation May 12 that

Congressional conferees approved legislation May 12 that
would dissolve the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Administration. Under the bill (S. 1306), ADAMHA's
research institutes, including the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, would become part of the National Institutes
of Health.

ADAMHA's service functions, including administration of
block grant programs, would continue under a new
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMSA), comprised of the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, and a
Center for Mental Health Services.

NIDA officials said the reorganization should have little
or no impact on the federal drug testing and laboratory
certification programs. The legislation would also
authorize new grant programs to encourage drug treatment
in the criminal justice system, treatment training,
capacity expansion, and the development of employee
assistance programs.

Workplace drug testing is an important tool in drug
prevention and user accountability, according to two new
documents from the Office of National Drug Control
Policy.

In a "white paper" entitled "Understanding Drug
Prevention" and a bulletin on "User Accountability,"
ONDCP hailed the drug testing programs of Texas
Instruments and Motorola for including all employees,
from the chief executive officer on down. It did not
mention the National Labor Relations Board's ruling last
year that Motorola had illegally prohibited employees
from distributing literature criticizing the drug testing
policy. For copies, contact ONDCP at (202) 467-9890.

LAST-CHANCE AGREEMENT CITED
IN DENIAL OF WORKER'S BENEFITS

A worker fired for a positive drug test has lost his bid
for unemployment benefits because his drug use violated
a last-chance agreement with his employer and therefore
was "misconduct" under state unemployment law, a
Washington appeals court has ruled. (Crain v. Employment
Security Department, Washington Court of Appeals,
Division One, No. 27826-6-I, April 13, 1992.)

Although the drug test alone was insufficient evidence to
prove misconduct, it could be considered along with the
worker's job performance and his agreement with the
employer, the court said.

Larry B. Crain tested positive for cocaine and marijuana
in April 1987 and was suspended from his job as a
production worker. The company agreed to reinstate him
provided he complete a drug treatment program and agree
to follow-up drug tests. Under the agreement, a second
positive test would result in Crain's firing.

Soon after returning to work, Crain received verbal
warnings from his supervisors for following improper
procedures. In October 1987, Crain's failure to properly
clamp part of a 200-ton machine caused "considerable
damage" to the equipment. Crain denied he was again using
drugs, but the company ordered him to submit to a test
because of the series of warnings he had been issued
since returning to work. He tested positive for marijuana
and was discharged.

The state Employment Security Department denied Crain's
application for unemployment benefits, but an
administrative law judge overturned that decision, ruling
that the department's policy prohibited using drug test
results to show that an employee was "under the
influence."

According to the department's Unemployment Procedures &
Methods Handbook, revised Oct. 30, 1986, "The results of
drug testing may not establish impairment or indicate
(with precision) when an illegal drug was used; such
results can only demonstrate the likelihood of prior drug
use. Therefore, discharging an employee based solely on
the employee's refusing to take or failing a drug test,
absent adverse job performance, is not misconduct."

The department commissioner, however, reversed the ALJ's
decision, finding instead that Crain's violation of the
last-chance agreement qualified as misconduct.

The appeals court agreed. Although drug test results are
"hearsay" evidence, and Washington employment law does
not allow misconduct to be proved exclusively by hearsay,
the court said the company relied on other evidence in
discharging Crain. Specifically, the court cited the
series of incidents involving Crain's work.

"Because this other evidence of drug impairment supported
the Commissioner's finding that Crain had violated his
re-entry agreement to remain drug-free, the Commissioner
did not err by also considering the test results to find
disqualifying misconduct," the court ruled.

COURT UPHOLDS DRUG TEST
OF GUARD WITHOUT POLICY

Louisiana corrections officials properly ordered a guard
to take a drug test based on allegations that the guard
had used drugs at a crack house, even though the
Corrections Department had no drug testing policy in
place at the time, a state court has ruled. (Banks v.
Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Louisiana
Court of Appeals, First Circuit, No. CA 91 0136, April
10, 1992.)

Department officials received a tip from the Baton Rouge
sheriff's department that one of their corrections
officers, Simmie Banks, had allegedly been observed
smoking crack in a crack house that was under
surveillance. Department officials contacted the juvenile
detention facility where Banks worked and ordered the
supervisor to send Banks to a laboratory for a drug test.
Banks refused to take the test without first consulting
an attorney, and was fired.

At the time (September 1989), the department did not have
a drug testing policy in place. The court ruled, however,
that the department was within its rights to order a drug
test because it had reasonable suspicion to believe Banks
had used drugs and because corrections officers are
subject to bodily searches as conditions of employment.
Banks was therefore properly disciplined for refusing a
legitimate order, the court ruled.

The court relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in
Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Association and
National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, which it
said implied that "a governmental employer's order to an
employee to submit to a drug test on the basis of
individualized suspicion of drug use is constitutionally
valid in certain circumstances." The circumstances in
this case included the government's interest in
maintaining order at detention centers and in keeping
drugs away from prisoners. Guards who use drugs "may be
much more likely to be involved in the introduction of
contraband into a correctional facility," the court said.

The lack of a written, announced drug testing policy did
not invalidate the order to Banks, the court said.
"Although Mr. Banks stated that at no time during his
employment at the [facility] was he informed that he
would be subject to drug testing, he did admit that he
knew as a condition of his employment he was subject to:
a bodily search or `shake-down' on a random basis,
vehicle shake-down, and possibly a strip search. Mr.
Banks admitted that he knew the Corrections Services
Rulebook prohibited employees from violating state or
federal law and that to do so could result in
termination."

In addition, "an employee's refusal to obey a direct
order is conduct which, by its very nature, impairs the
efficient operation of the public service for which he
was employed."

LABS AND TESTING: MANDATED EMPLOYERS HAVE
RULES, NON-MANDATED EMPLOYERS DON'T

Even if you have absolutely nothing to do with
transportation, weapons, or any other
safety-sensitive business, chances are you have
heard that if you do drug testing, you should
use a lab certified by the federal Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration.

Actually, it's even more likely you are still
hearing about "NIDA labs," since the agency
which formally ran the National Laboratory
Certification Program has stuck to the labs.
You are probably also told to use Medical
Review Officers (doctors who interpret test
results), gas chromatography coupled with mass
spectrometry (a confirmation test), and
possibly even told to limit the drugs you are
testing for to the "NIDA five" (amphetamines,
cocaine, marijuana, opiates, and
phencyclidine). You may even be told expressly
not to fire someone who tests positive, but to
send him to treatment or an EAP first.

But unless you are mandated by the government
to conduct testing this way, you don't have to
do any of these things. So, why do lawyers,
consultants, and other purveyors of advice to
employers insist on using the guidelines that
are mandatory mainly for federal employees and
safety-sensitive employees in DOT-licensed
companies?

'NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT'

"The HHS guidelines are not a legal
requirement," explains David Evans, a lawyer in
Lawrenceville, New Jersey who is an expert on
drug testing. "But the reason lawyers like to
use them is because they're written down."
Lawyers, says Evans, "love it when somebody
gives them some complex regulation and they can
hit somebody over the head with it." Evans says
employers who follow HHS/SAMHSA/DOT protocols
unnecessarily are "putting on too much gold
plate."

Not everyone agrees. "It's worth going through
what compliance programs go through," says Mac
Allen, executive director of the Substance
Abuse Program Administrators Association
(SAPAA), a Nashville-based group of corporate
and third-party drug-testing programs. "I don't
think the lab is the key as much as the MRO is
the key," says Allen. "If an employee tests
positive for opiates, for example, and he's
using a bona-fide prescription drug, he would
be protected."

But most SAPAA members are DOT-mandated
employers, or third-party administrators who
want work from DOT-mandated employers. For a
small business, on-site hand-held tests might
be the way to go.

"Some of the on-site tests are pretty good,"
says J. Michael Walsh, who wrote the federal
guidelines before he left government last year
to run a private consulting business. As long
as the test is an FDA-approved immunoassay, the
employer should feel confident using it, he
says. If the employer plans to take action
against an employee, however, Walsh recommends
that any on-site test which is positive be
confirmed by sending the sample to a lab.

One reason it is important to confirm an
on-site test in a lab, especially in the case
of opiates or amphetamines, is a phenomenon
known as cross-reactivity, says Walsh. But if
you use the on-site tests just for marijuana
and cocaine, there is nothing that
cross-reacts, he adds.

The HHS system was set up because of search and
seizure concerns. The first people to be tested
under it were federal employees, and the system
had to pass constitutional muster because it
was government action. "There's a two-pronged
test for search and seizure," explains Evans.
"The search must be justified in its inception,
which means there must be proper reason for the
search. And it must be justified in its scope,
which means you shouldn't search for anything
except what you're searching for." This means
that a drug test shouldn't look for
prescription medication, for example, or poppy
seeds on a bagel. The federal government tried
to deal with both prongs of the
search-and-seizure issue in developing the HHS
guidelines.

Private employers don't need to worry about
search and seizure at all, however.

The federal guidelines initially avoided
on-site testing "because we knew we'd have
court challenges," says Walsh, and officials
wanted the system to withstand legal scrutiny.
But technology has changed, and so has the
sophistication level of people involved in
on-site testing. "Now people know how to use
hand-held systems," says Walsh. In 1985, when
the certification system was set up, there were
only two on-site systems, and they were
tabletop, not hand-held. They required
technicians who were skilled and sophisticated.
"We were concerned about some construction
supervisor running around with one of these in
the back of a pickup truck testing people," he
says.

Interestingly, it is the unions who really like
the federal guidelines, Walsh notes. "The
unions feel very comfortable with my
standards," he says with a wry laugh.

But Evans notes that many employers can't
comply with the HHS guidelines. "They're too
expensive and complicated," he says. "On-site
is cheaper, it's more convenient, it's easier."

If the employer is planning to take action, the
test should be confirmed in a licensed lab,
says Evans. "Most states have got some law
regulating labs."

COSTS OF TESTING

Walsh says the per-test cost from
SAMHSA-certified labs has come down
drastically. "Most of the labs now charge in
the neighborhood of $15 to $20 a specimen,"
says Walsh. What about the cost of collection
and MRO services? Allen says SAPAA can
recommend a third-party administrator who can
do collection, testing, and MRO work for under
$50 a test. (Initial setup costs would probably
be about $500 in addition, depending on the
complexity of the policy, he says.)

THE LIABILITY MYTH

Pressed to explain why they recommend following
the federal testing guidelines even when it's
not required, many people ultimately admit it
is fear of lawsuits.

"The DOT along with GC/MS has been through the
court system," says Allen. If an employer fires
a worker for a positive test and hasn't
followed this system, the employer might be
opening himself up to liability, these people
say. "If you get rid of someone, he might sue
you for hundreds of thousands of dollars," says
SAPAA's Allen.

"There's not a lot of liability in drug
testing," counters Evans. "There's this myth
that employers will be liable." In the one case
in which an employer did lose hundreds of
thousands of dollars, Southern Pacific had been
"beastly" to the employee, says Evans, clearly
going out of its way to defy the San Francisco
anti-testing ordinance.

TECHNO-PHOBIA AT WORK

Another problem for employers, says Evans, is
the fact that drug testing involves scientific
technology, which is unusual in the workplace.
This techno-phobia is "like math phobia," he
says. "So instead, they seize on the idea that
there are too many legal problems."

Finally, Evans says even the gold standard,
GC/MS, won't solve all your problems. "GC/MS
isn't perfect," he says. "It's very complex. I
think the only reason it hasn't been attacked
is because attorneys don't understand it."

One last note: Whether you use a
SAMHSA-certified lab, a state-certified lab, or
an on-site test, don't expect technology to
remain static. The federal government moves
slowly, but even the sacred guidelines are
changing. Stay tuned!

DRUG TESTING OF NON-SAFETY-
SENSITIVE WORKERS UPHELD

In one of the most recent of California's
seminal drug-testing rulings, an appeals court
has ruled that an employee who refused to take
a drug test was guilty of misconduct and
therefore did not qualify for unemployment
compensation. In handing down its ruling March
9 in AFL-CIO v. the California Unemployment
Insurance Appeals Board (93 Daily Journal
D.A.R. 3164), the California Court of Appeal
has taken the rights of employers to test
beyond the zone of the safety-sensitive job
position.

The case involved David Hayes, who worked on a
Chevron oil-drilling rig, but not as an oil
worker and not employed by Chevron. Hayes was
employed as a housekeeper by a company which
was under contract with Chevron to maintain the
living quarters for oil workers. The company
required all of its employees to have an annual
physical, which included a drug test. When the
physical was scheduled, however, he told his
supervisor that he could not take the drug test
because he knew he would test positive. He had
been smoking marijuana while on shore leave.

Hayes was fired for refusing to take the test.
But he could not receive unemployment because
the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board said he was discharged for job-related
misconduct.

The AFL-CIO took the case to court on behalf of
Hayes, arguing that what Hayes did off the rig
had nothing to do with his job, and therefore
was not job-related misconduct. Furthermore,
Hayes' job wasn't even safety-sensitive, the
AFL-CIO said. The unemployment board was acting
counter to its earlier decisions, in denying
compensation to someone who did not have a
dangerous job and who was not suspected of
using drugs on the job.

The court disagreed, saying that work on an oil
rig is dangerous, regardless of the job.
"Although a slip and fall in the kitchen of a
restaurant or in a hotel room might not
endanger anyone other than the person who fell,
on an oil platform a slip and fall could be on
outside stairways or areas where the impaired
employee might not only injure himself, but
cause others to leave their posts to rescue
him," the ruling states. "Similarly, spilling
grease which could cause a fire might not be so
much of a concern where all other employees can
leave the threatened area. In a self-contained
area out in the ocean on an oil derrick, the
threat of fire becomes much more significant."

SURVEY: OVER ONE THIRD OF
EMPLOYERS FIRE AT FIRST POSITIVE

Although most employers refer workers who test
positive for drugs to an EAP or a treatment
program, over one third fire employees for the
first positive test, a recent survey has found.
The positive rate is about 5 percent, according
to the survey of 183 employers conducted by
William M. Mercer.

Most of the companies tested for amphetamines,
barbiturates, cocaine, hallucinogens, and
opiates, according to the survey. Only half
test for alcohol, "even though its prevalence
of abuse far exceeds that of illicit and
prescription drugs," says Mercer consultant
Shael Barger, who is based in San Francisco.

Barger strongly believes that testing can be
used to identify troubled employees and refer
them to treatment. "Drug testing does work, but
there needs to be confidentiality protections
and access to treatment," she tells DIW.

Employees should be encouraged to come forward
if they need help, and returned to their
position once treated, she says. After a
certain point, if an employee is unable to
maintain abstinence, then he may be let go.

"My concern is to protect the employer from
litigation," says Barger. But she also is
concerned that substance abuse problems not be
driven underground by punitive methods.

Noting that the Americans with Disabilities Act
prohibits discrimination against an alcoholic,
Barger says it's unfortunate that the statute
doesn't apply to illicit drugs as well. "It is
a disease," she says of drug addiction. "I wish
the ADA was as emphatic on illicit drugs as
alcohol."

If employers send the workers who test positive
for treatment -- as most of surveyed employers
did -- they will benefit, says Barger.
"Substance abuse can result in work site
accidents, increased absenteeism and lowered
productivity, all of which carry high price
tags," she says. "Even though a drug screening
program detects relatively few substance
abusers, it can still save significant sums by
identifying chemically dependent workers and
motivating them to seek treatment."

Of the employers surveyed, 30 percent do no
drug testing at all, citing concerns about
legal liability, employee privacy, and test
accuracy.

EAPS NEED TQM

Total quality management, or TQM, a buzz-phrase
of the 1980s, is still trying to find its way
into EAPs. While incorporating the principles
of TQM -- encouraging employee participation
and self-esteem, eliminating fear, constantly
improving service, and providing leadership
instead of demanding production quotas -- seem
beyond the scope of EAP activities, they are
important to the survival of the EAP, according
to an article in the March issue of EAPA
Exchange, the monthly house organ of the
Employee Assistance Professionals Association.

Of course, TQM may be too much for external
EAPs -- those which operate on a contract basis
for many different companies, and which often
aren't enough of a participant themselves in
their client companies to play a role in
setting the broad policies that make up TQM.
But for internal EAPs, which operate as part of
a company, TQM is necessary, according to the
article, which is based on a survey of both
internal and external programs.

If EAPs don't get involved in TQM, they may be
seen by management -- which pays the bill -- as
nothing but a dumping ground for troubled
workers. The next step is for the employer to
question the value of having an internal EAP at
all -- and suddenly, the EAP finds itself out
of business in favor of a contract with an
external vendor. Doing TQM is really a matter
of survival, internal EAPs say.

CHANGE AT MOTOROLA

"If we choose not to integrate with other
areas, we run the risk of being relegated to a
corner of the building where we see downtrodden
employees and, eventually, are dropped in favor
of an external vendor," says Sheila Monaghan,
corporate director of the EAP at Motorola. "For
a time, EAPs operated in a nonintegrated way in
order to have sufficient numbers of employees
using their services." The nonintegrated system
allowed supervisors to refer -- or send --
employees to the EAP whenever they thought it
was a good idea.

Under the integrated system, a supervisor
referral is not made until the supervisor has
first consulted with the EAP. Perhaps there are
"alternative strategies" which could be
followed. The purpose is not to enhance the
power of the EAP, but to create a general
problem-solving environment involving
management, HR, and the EAP.

"This means that HR teams need to develop their
own process to interface efficiently in the
referral process," says Monaghan. "When each
team understands and coordinates the process,
together we can further increase our total
efficiency."

No stranger to TQM in its non-EAP world,
Motorola won the Malcolm Baldrige national
quality award in 1988.

BEYOND COUNSELING

In general, EAPs are good at more than
counseling: their skills make them experts at
interviewing a supervisor, for example, to find
out what the problem is. In this way, internal
EAPs are poised to become part of HR. This
means letting go of the old way of doing
things, in which the EAP advocated for the
employee, protecting him from HR and
management.

The advantage of this method is that employees
saw the EAP as a safe haven, and were more
likely to confide in it. The disadvantage was
that the EAP's hands would be tied when it came
to working with HR or management. Ultimately,
management found that subsidizing counseling
for its problem workers was not a
cost-effective goal for its EAP.

Even EAPs which are more focused on counseling
employees than on management and HR can play an
important role in TQM, says Dan Conti, Ph.D.,
EAP director at the First National Bank of
Chicago. Outcome measurements for behavioral
health care -- psychotherapy and substance
abuse treatment -- are especially important to
Conti, whose EAP does managed care as well.
Determining whether treatment works is one way
to incorporate the "spirit" of TQM into the
EAP-managed care combination, an increasingly
popular mix. "We're interested in much more
than a satisfaction survey that asks, `Are you
happy with your provider?,'" he says.
"Sophisticated outcome measurement can drive
real quality improvement -- that is, treatment
effectiveness -- for an EAP-managed care
system.

Another key to EAP TQM is understanding the
customer. The customer is the company --
management and HR -- who is buying the EAP. The
employee is not the customer, he is the user.

Is TQM out of the question altogether for
external EAPs? It better not be, according to
Terry Cowan, executive director of Workers
Assistance Program, based in Austin, Texas.
External EAPs like his shouldn't expect to
simply get referrals, says Cowan, who has seen
the many external EAPs swallowed up by
insurance companies to perform managed care.
"We see ourselves in survival mode right now,"
he says. His advice to internal EAPs who don't
want to be replaced by externals: sit in at
every upper-level management meeting and be a
part of all management decisions.

HOW TESTING CAN REDUCE WORKERS' COMPENSATION
COSTS

Drug testing is a useful tool for controlling
workers' compensation costs -- at least if you
can convince the insurance company that your
program will reduce claims. Gregory and Howe, a
law firm specializing in management consulting,
has arranged for a drug-testing program for its
clients which improves their chances of
lowering their workers' compensation rates.

"It's been proven that when companies put a
comprehensive drug-testing program in place,
their claims are reduced dramatically," says
George Howe, a principal at the Shelton,
Connecticut-based firm.

It does require an "enlightened" insurance
company to give a discount in exchange for drug
testing, Howe admits.  "AIG is familiar with
Gregory and Howe's program. They know it's
comprehensive, and they can validate that the
company they're underwriting is doing the
testing," he says.

The fact that an outside firm -- Gregory and
Howe -- is running the testing program is very
important to an underwriter, says James Hughes,
president of Windsor Insurance, a broker who
works with the law firm and with AIG. "One of
the things AIG says is that it's great to have
a drug-testing program, but they want to make
sure it has some bite to it," Hughes tells us.

Discounts come in one of two ways, says Howe.
First, if an insurance company is convinced
that a drug-testing program will drastically
reduce workers' compensation claims, there
could be a 10 percent reduction at the start.

More likely, however, is the "gain-sharing"
program. "It's like profit sharing," Hughes
says. "Let's say we go in and check out the
company with AIG, and agree the annual premium
is $300,000. We'll handle claims payment and
review, and we can reduce the costs. We may be
able to reduce the costs by $100,000, and that
savings would then be shared by AIG and the
employer." The broker uses managed care and
fraud detection to reduce claims costs.
Drug-testing is done also.

In order to qualify for a workers compensation
discount from AIG, an employer would have to
conduct random and pre-employment drug testing,
says Hughes. In addition, a third party -- not
the employer -- would have to oversee the
drug-testing program to make sure "it's done
correctly," he says.

For Howe, "correctly" means following
Department of Transportation protocol: using
labs certified by the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, using a
Medical Review Officer to interpret all
positives, and following federal collection
guidelines. Howe says the DOT system is the
most legally sound. With the DOT system, "if a
disgruntled employee wants to take action
against a company, he won't be able to take
them to court," Howe says.

The medical review officer protects the
employee from being labeled a drug user when he
is using only prescription drugs, says Howe.
"Almost weekly we have an opiate positive that
is reversed for dietary or medical reasons," he
says.

Although Gregory and Howe contracts with
laboratories and has a Medical Review Officer,
it is more than a third-party administrator,
says Howe. "There are a lot of TPAs or MRO
organizations that try to sell their services
like they're selling laser beams," he says. "We
start at the top, with the policy." But this
doesn't mean that turnaround time is slow.
"With us, you get good turnaround time -- 24
hours for negatives, and 48 to 72 hours for
positives."

PER-TEST COST: $55

What is the cost of Gregory and Howe's program?
Billing is simple: about $55 per test. The
program setup and administration is built into
the per-test cost. Gregory and Howe also
handles the paperwork--test results are kept on
employees at the law firm. "You're dealing with
an individual's livelihood," says Howe. "So if
an auditor wants to see files, we have them."

As for AIG, the need for antidrug programs in
terms of workers compensation was driven home
by a recent case in which a man fell off a
ladder and broke his arm -- normally about
$3,000 in  claims, says Hughes. But the man's
arm wouldn't heal properly. "It was determined
that the reason it wasn't healing was because
the man was a drug user -- an addict," says
Hughes. The workers' compensation board ruled
that the employer had to pay for inpatient
substance abuse treatment as part of the
workplace injury. "AIG knows the benefits of
having workers who are off drugs," says Hughes.
"But they like to see a comprehensive program."

PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION OFFERS
MODEL DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE LAWS

The President's Commission on Model State Drug
Laws, which spent most of last year holding
hearings on state legislation needed to deal
with drugs in different arenas, has come up
with six different model acts, as follows:
*  Drug-Free Private Sector Workplace Act;
*  Drug-Free Workplace Workers' Compensation
Premium Reduction Act;
*  Employee Assistance Programs and
Professionals Act;
*  Drug-Free Public Work Force Act;
*  Drug-Free Workplace Act; and
*  Employee Addiction Recovery Act.

The purposes of the proposed laws is to reduce
the costs of medical claims, medical
disability, injuries, theft, absenteeism, and
decreased productivity associated with abuse.
The proposed laws also would help employees get
treatment. The statutes would:
  *Require a drug-free workplace program to
include written policies, EAPs or
rehabilitation resources, employee education,
supervisor training, drug testing, laboratory
standards, and provisions for employee
confidentiality.
*  Protect private employers from litigation
from a good-faith employee drug test, if the
employers have a comprehensive drug-free
program.
*  Provide for a 5 percent reduction in
workers' compensation insurance premiums for
employers with comprehensive drug-free
workplace programs.
*  Allow addicted or alcoholic public-sector
employees to get treatment without job loss.
*  Allow termination or probationary
employment for any public-sector employee who
is convicted of a criminal drug offense.
*  Require all contractors, subcontractors, and
grantees doing business with or for the state
to have comprehensive drug-free workplace
programs.
*  Set up a state licensing entity for EAP
professionals.
*  Give employers a tax credit equal to 50
percent of what they paid for treating an
employee for alcohol or drug abuse.

BORG-WARNER GUARDS TESTED AS APPLICANTS

Borg-Warner Security Corporation, which owns
Wells Fargo Guard Services and Burns
International Security Services, does drug
testing on a pre-employment basis only. But
with 65,000 security guards as employees and a
high turnover rate, this is a lot of testing.
It's done with an on-site test called the MACH
IV, which screens for cocaine, heroin,
marijuana, and methamphetamines.

If the MACH IV is positive, the sample goes to
a lab for confirmation, says Joe Allen, a
spokesman for the Chicago-based Borg-Warner.

There's a lot of "self-selection" that goes on
with pre-employment testing, says Allen. "When
people come in, there's a large sign that says
all applicants are tested for drugs. Some
people have to go out to feed the parking meter
or something, and they never come back."

LAB CERTIFICATION: HEADED FOR FDA?

The laboratory certification currently done by
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA) may not stay there
forever, according to the chief architect of
the lab program as well as the federally
mandated testing protocols. The certification
program may be headed for the Food and Drug
Administration or the Health Care Financing
Administration.

J. Michael Walsh, Ph.D., who wrote the
guidelines when head of the drug-testing
program at the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, has suggested that the FDA would be a
better place than SAMHSA for the National
Laboratory Certification Program, which he
established. In any event, the certification
program won't go back to NIDA, which is now
part of the National Institutes of Health, and
not involved with regulation. The next move is
up to the Department of Health and Human
Services, which oversees the FDA, HCFA, SAMHSA,
and NIH.

"I really do think HHS has got to do
something," says Walsh, who has been a
workplace drug-testing consultant in Bethesda
since leaving the federal government a year
ago. "The whole program is hanging up in the
air now. And there isn't a good understanding
of how much the private sector relies on it."

While Walsh has no criticism of the way SAMHSA
is running the certification, he says there is
a big problem with lack of funding and lack of
interest. "It's not a high priority now," he
says. As proof, he offers the long-awaited
final rule amending the testing guidelines,
which would lower the cutoff level for
marijuana screens, require Medical Review
Officers to be independent from laboratories,
and make other changes in the protocols. "It's
so long overdue it's ridiculous," says Walsh,
who contends the changes should have been made
four years ago. "There's nothing controversial,
but someone has to sign it," he says. "I never
thought that it would take so long" for
regulatory changes to follow changes in
technology, he adds. The changes aren't merely
formalities, Walsh notes. Lowering the cutoff
level to 50 nanograms per milliliter for
marijuana screens "would triple the positives,"
he says.

CAN A WORKER BE FIRED FOR A SECOND POSITIVE
TEST
IF HE ISN'T FIRED FOR THE FIRST?

What happened: As a backhoe operator on live
gas lines, William LaGard, an employee of
Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, was subject to
random drug testing by the requirement of the
federal Department of Transportation.

He also was a member of the Utility Workers
Union, which negotiated a collective bargaining
agreement allowing management to fire workers
for "proper cause."

When he tested positive for cocaine in 1992,
Columbia Gas referred LaGard to the EAP, and he
was afforded the chance for treatment. After he
returned from treatment and the company's
Medical Review Officer cleared him to return to
work, the company worked out a last-chance
agreement with him which clearly stated that
his next positive test for drugs or alcohol
would result in his termination. At this
meeting, LaGard declined union representation.

But less than a year later, LaGard again tested
positive for cocaine. The company fired him,
and the union cried foul.
*If the first positive test wasn't grounds to
fire the worker, then neither was the second
positive test.
*In negotiating directly with LaGard, Columbia
Gas violated the collective bargaining
agreement, making the last-chance agreement
invalid.
*Union and management never agreed that two
positive tests are justification for discharge.

The company rebutted that it did have the right
to fire the worker.
*Had it so desired, Columbia Gas could have
fired him after the first positive test; just
because it waived its right to do so doesn't
mean it can't do so after the second.
*Firing the worker is necessary to uphold
public policy, which is rooted in protecting
the safety of the public.
*LaGard said he didn't want union
representation at the meeting during which the
last-chance agreement was negotiated.

The ruling: LaGard stays fired, ruled
Arbitrator James C. Duff in a January 31
decision. The deciding factor, the referee
said, was "proper cause." When a worker is
employed in a safety-sensitive job, as LaGard
even admitted he was, and when that worker
twice tests positive for drugs, he has no
guarantee of his job, according to the ruling.

And the arbitrator was impressed by the fact
that the worker had been given the chance to go
to treatment. "Nothing guarantees that multiple
treatment and/or rehabilitation opportunities
will be afforded to multiple offenders," said
Duff.

The idea that if a single positive test merits
treatment instead of firing, then so should the
second positive, is "too strained to be
accepted," he said, noting that the employee
had been clearly notified that his next
positive test would not be followed by the same
degree of tolerance.

 As for the validity of the last-chance
agreement, LaGard lost his right to argue this
when he declined union representation at the
meeting, the arbitrator said. Furthermore, the
fact that there was "proper cause" for the
termination made the claim of invalidity moot.
(Case not yet reported.)

WHEN DO A GROUP
OF EMPLOYEES
CONSTITUTE A `CREW'?

What Happened: At the Rolidack Steel Company,
the job of Mould Dipping Laborer was concerned
with knocking plugs off the hot top
moulds,cleaning off the stools, replacing metal
plates on these stools and washing them down.
For a while there were three employee Mould
Dipping Laborers on each shift.

Suddenly, the Rolidack powers ordained that
only two Dipping Laborers were needed. That
brought the union running with a grievance
demanding that Rolidack return to the
three-workers-per-shift policy.

At an arbitration hearing, the union argued:

1. Our union contract guarantees the existence
of a protected crew size--a minimum of three in
the case of Mould Dipping Laborers.

2. The elimination of the third worker has
placed too great a strain on the remaining two
workers.

3. Furthermore, management has not justified
the removal of the third worker on the basis of
significant changes in the job.

A Rolidack official responded:

  *  Because of the varying kind of work done
by the Mould Dipping Laborers, we have never
considered these workers to compose a protected
"crew."

  *  Moreover, recent changes in the job
support the removal of one employee from this
work.


RULING

The Mould Dipping Workers do not compose a
'crew' and the company can change their number
at its own discretion, ruled Arbitrator Thomas
J. McDermott

The referee held:

"The number of Mould Dipping Laborers worked
per (shift) has varied from 1 to 3 and on a few
occasions to 4. No relationship was shown
between the changes in numbers that have taken
place and any given set of working
conditions.Thus, it can only be concluded that
this job has been scheduled on the basis of
what was determined to be the work load. There
is absent, therefore the proof that a protected
work crew...has existed." (46 LA 733)

COMMENT

In another ruling, the same arbitrator
declared:

"Most arbitrators hold...that a crew for
purposes of local working conditions exists
where the employees making up the work force
have a relationship that is interdependent of
each other. This would mean that, when one
member is removed or absent, the remaining
workers are required to assume an increased
amount of work, or there is a significant
change in the type of work they are required to
perform. In other words, there must be a
relationship between the--nature of the work
and the interdependence of members to each
other." (40 LA 67)

IS A COMPANY BOUND
BY AN ERROR IN FIXING
AN EMPLOYEE'S PENSION?

What Happened: Following surgery to relieve a
cancerous condition, Gerald Mack, who was 62
years old and had been employed by the Carvian
Company for 43 years, felt that his working
days were drawing to a close. He was attracted
by the possibility of early retirement under
the Social Security Act in conjunction with a
pension from Carvian.

Mack took early retirement after consulting his
Foreman and Henry Galt, the company's Personnel
Manager. Both assured him that he would receive
a monthly retirement check from Carvian for
$220.78. Mack's first retirement check was in
that amount and he was again assured by Galt
that the figure was correct.

However, the next month Mack received a check
for $110.39. When Mack demanded an explanation,
an embarrassed Henry Galt admitted that the
original check for $220.78 was an error; the
figure should have been $110.39.

At an arbitration session called to consider
Mack's grievance, the pensioner's union
advocate expounded:

1. Gerald Mack, a faithful, longtime employee
relied implicitly upon the representations made
to him by his foreman and Personnel Manager
Galt that he would receive  a certain sum in
retirement which would make it feasible for him
to cease working.

2. This turned out to be an irresponsible
mistake, which makes it difficult for him to
cover his retirement living expenses.

The company's Personnel Manager answered:

  *  Mistakes in pension figures occasionally
occur in processing retirement requests.

  *  These are inadvertent errors and should
not be made binding on the employer.

Did The Employee Win?  YES  q  NO  q

RULING

The company must continue to pay Mack the
greater pension, ruled Arbitrator John F.
Sembower. The arbitrator declared:

"Gerald Mack was entitled to rely upon the
positive and well-intentioned although
erroneous information supplied to him by his
foreman who, in turn obtained it from the local
officer of the company charged with developing
such information accurately."(63 LA 669)

COMMENT

On the other hand, arbitrators and courts have
held that when a worker who receives by error a
windfall payment of some sort to which he/she
is not entitled, and of a nature which should
have forewarned him that something had gone
wrong, he must make restitution.

IS IT DISCRIMINATORY
TO DENY A MERIT HIKE
TO A SHOP STEWARD?

What Happened: Five years had elapsed since
Glenn Collier had received a merit increase.
Each time, Collier had been stymied by the
section of the Progress Report Form labeled
"Output." The wording was virtually always the
same: "His output is low because of endless
outside distraction and telephone calls."

Finally, Collier, who was the shop steward,
filed a grievance in his own behalf calling for
a merit increase.The matter was bucked to an
arbitrator before whom Collier thundered:

1. The company's Progress Report Form lists
nine factors considered in awarding a merit
increase: knowledge, judgment, dependability,
cooperation, initiative, communication,
flexibility, creativity and output.

2. I was rated "good"  on all but "output."
Obviously, I'm being discriminated against
because I'm a dedicated steward.

A company spokesman contradicted:

  *  The passage of time does not justify a
merit raise.

  *  A merit raise means that an employee has
done more than is normally expected of him.

  *  Collier's union duties keep him from doing
no more than getting by on his job.That's his
problem, not ours.

Was The Company Right?  YES  q  NO  q

CAN AN EMPLOYEE
BE COMPELLED TO POSTPONE A VACATION?

What Happened: Ordinarily, vacations granted to
employees by the Glimbit Corporation occurred
between April 1st and October 31st. The company
reserved the right to determine each employee's
vacation period.

When Paul Gregory requested a two-week vacation
in August, it was denied him because, according
to Glimbit, it did not have an experienced
replacement. "We can't spare you during the
period prior to October 31st without affecting
the efficient operation of the plant," a
Glimbit higher-up told him. However, on
November 18th, Paul Gregory was told he would
start his vacation on November 21st.

Paul Gregory hotfooted to union headquarters
and had the Local process a grievance
protesting the manner in which his vacation
desires had been treated by Glimbit. At the
arbitration hearing, Gregory contended:

  *  I've been treated unfairly by Glimbit. The
company pretended I could not be spared during
the month of August, the period during which my
and my family's vacation needs could best be
met.

A company official rejoined:

1. We genuinely could not have spared Gregory
until November.

2. Anyway, the granting of time off in the
usual vacation period is not mandatory. Our
company has the exclusive right to schedule
vacations.

     Was The Company Right?  YES  q  NO  q


RULING

The company had the right to postpone the
employee's vacation, ruled Arbitrator Peter M.
Kelliher. The referee stated:

"The contract does not require that employees
be granted a vacation during the period of
April 1st to October 31st. (The contract)
indicates that the vacation season shall
'preferably' be during such a period. It is
also noted that the final right of determining
the vacation period of any employee is
exclusively reserved to the company to insure
efficient operation of the plant."  (15 LA 481)

COMMENT

Here's the provision in the union contract
which reserved to management the right to
determine when vacations could be granted:

"Section 8. Vacations shall insofar as possible
be granted by the company at time between April
1st and October 31st most desired by the
eligible employees, but final right of
determining the vacation of any employee is
exclusively reserved to the company  to insure
efficient operation of the plant." (emphasis
added)

HAS A COMPANY A RIGHT TO SUSPEND AN EMPLOYEE
WHO IS UNDER ARREST?

What Happened:On October 8, 1992, Travis
Lowery, a Security Protection Officer (SPO)
employed by the Vansellor Security Service, was
arrested while on duty at a facility operated
by an oil company. Lowery was charged with
committing the crime of assault and battery. He
was taken to a local jail and released on bail
24 hours later. When Lowery returned to work,
Vansellor immediately suspended him without pay
pending the outcome of the criminal charges
against him.

Lowery's union came to his defense with a
grievance for his reinstatement. The union's
demand was adamantly rejected by Vansellor and
both sides soon squared off before an
arbitrator. At the hearing, the employer
maintained:

1. A security officer like Lowery is held to a
higher standard than other workers because he
carries a weapon and has authority over people.
Lowery was arrested for a crime of violence. We
can't take the risk of permitting him to
continue on duty.

2. To permit a security employee, who is under
arrest, to remain at his post would cause us
great embarrassment among our clients.

Lowery's union advocate insisted:

  *  During his 6 years as a Security
Protection Officer at Vansellor, Lowery has
been an excellent employee and has received
high performance evaluations from his
superiors.

  *  Vansellor did not conduct any
investigation of the charges made against
Lowery, nor produce any evidence he is guilty
of the offense.

  *  There was little publicity about Lowery's
arrest - and Vansellor has suffered little, if
any, embarrassment.
   Did The Employee Win?  YES  q  NO  q


RULING

Reinstate the Security Protection Officer,
ruled Arbitrator Charles H.Frost. The
arbitrator saw no merit in the employer's plea
of "embarrassment." He could find no proof that
there was widespread public knowledge of
Lowery's arrest--or that his co-workers were
reluctant to work with him. The arbitrator was
also impressed by the fact that Lowery had
received disparate treatment in that  other
security personnel who had been charged with
more serious crimes were not disciplined. (94-1
ARB Par.4100)

COMMENT

Where an employee is arrested at the work site
for committing a crime, the employer is faced
with two options. If the employer finds that
the offense calls for discipline, it can
proceed to prove its case  in the same way as
if the employee were charged with industrial
misconduct. On the other hand, the employer can
leave the matter to the courts and reserve
final decision until the verdict is rendered.

Bear in mind that if an employer decides to
suspend the employee, it must be able to prove
that keeping the employee on the job pending a
court decision, would have an adverse impact on
its operations.

WHEN DOES AN EMPLOYEE BECOME PERMANENTLY AND
TOTALLY DISABLED?

What Happened: While cutting torque converters
in the course of his job with the Nedicrode
Corporation, Edward Fowler reached up to pull a
converter from a pallet. The act caused him to
feel a burning sting and to pass out.

Fowler was hospitalized and treated by various
neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons. He
underwent operations which, among other
results, led to the removal of the disc around
the nerve in his lower spine. Despite all the
treatment rendered to him, Fowler was often
racked  by severe pain.

Fowler pressed a claim for Workers'
Compensation and was awarded permanent and
total disability benefits. While conceding
Fowler's entitlement to Workers' Compensation,
Nedicrode's insurance company challenged his
right to total benefits. Both sides wound up in
a courtroom, where Fowler's lawyer set forth:

1. The physicians and vocational experts who
have examined and treated Fowler unite in
declaring that he is 100% vocationally disabled
because of his pain. He will never again  be
able to do the only work he was trained to
perform.

2. There is no choice but to grant him
permanent and total disability benefits.

The insurance attorney replied:

  *  If he tried, Fowler could find employment
other than that he performed prior to his
accident. He could be retrained to handle
lighter jobs. After all, he has no restrictions
on walking or driving.

  *  It is unreasonable to place a relatively
young person such as Fowler into virtual
retirement on full benefits.
     Was The Insurance Carrier Right?  YES  q
NO  q

RULING

Fowler is entitled to permanent and total
disability benefits, ruled the Alabama Court of
Civil Appeals. Fowler's case was strongly
bolstered by testimony from physicians and
vocational experts as to the incurable and
relentless pain visited upon him by his
on-the-job accident. The court brushed aside
the insurance carrier's argument that Fowler
should explore possibilities of alternative
employment.

"The test for total disability is the inability
to perform one's trade, and if so unable, then
the inability to obtain other reasonably
gainful employment. The employee is not
required to be absolutely helpless or suffer
total disability. Gainful employment means
employment similar in remuneration to that
earned prior to the injury (and) compatible
with the employee's pre-injury occupation, age,
education and aptitude," the tribunal held.
(630 So.2d 471)

COMMENT

In an earlier decision, an Alabama court ruled
"An employee who is so injured that he can
perform no services other than those which are
so limited in quality, dependability, or
quantity that a  reasonable stable market for
them does not exist, may well be classified as
totally disabled." (103 So.2d 315)

IF AN EMPLOYEE IS SICK MUST HE BE CALLED
FOR OVERTIME?

What Happened: "I won't be in today, Mr.
Schultz," Charley Stratton rasped over the
phone to his supervisor one Friday morning.
"I'm down with a cold."

"Hope you feel better. See you Monday,' replied
Schultz.

Stratton looked better on Monday--until he
learned that several members of his unit had
been asked to work overtime on the previous
Saturday.

"Why wasn't I asked,too?" Stratton asked his
supervisor in an injured tone.

"You were out sick. You weren't in shape to
work."

Stratton was so angry that he filed a grievance
demanding that he paid for the overtime denied
him. When the issue reached arbitration,
Stratton fumed:

1.The union contract says that all employees
are entitled to an equal crack at overtime.

2. Although I was sick on Friday, it didn't
mean that I was unwell on Saturday. A telephone
call to my home by the supervisor would have
made that clear.

A company factotum riposted:

  *  When an employee calls in sick, we assume
that he's out of commission - until he tells us
otherwise.

  *  It's unreasonable to expect a supervisor
to call up employees who are at home sick every
time we have to get up a group for overtime
work to check up if they're well enough to come
in.
  Was The Compnay Right?  YES  q  NO  q


RULING

No overtime money for Stratton, ruled
Arbitrator Raymond Goetz. There is a reasonable
basis for assuming that an employee who is out
sick is unavailable for overtime, the
arbitrator pointed out. Furthermore, the need
for overtime usually arises shortly before the
work is to be performed. A company cannot be
expected to phone absent employees to come in
for work on short notice. The logical step is
to ask the employees who are on hand to do the
extra work. (72-2 ARB Par., 8459)

COMMENT

The outcome might have been different if
Stratton had known about the overtime and had
telephoned in to his supervisor to volunteer
for the work. The arbitrator suggested that
then the employer would have been on notice
that the employee was able to work overtime.

RULING

No merit raise for Glenn Collier, ruled
Arbitrator Neil M. Gundermann. The umpire
opined:

"The Progress Review Form did not indicate that
the employee was performing in a manner which
would support a merit increase. To receive such
an increase there must be real merit--greater
output, handling of more difficult assignments,
greater effort or some manifestation of greater
value to the company. A merit increase is not
due merely with the passage of time." (67-1 ARB
Par. 8217)

COMMENT
What won this case for the company is that
management was able to show that it had a true
"Merit Progress" procedure. The employees were
rated every six months--not haphazardly--but in
face-to-face talks with their supervisors. Good
and bad points were discussed and supervisors
encouraged employees to ask questions on how
they could improve.

QUARTERLY APPRAISALS REPLACE NATWEST'S ANNUAL PAY REVIEW

THE UK'S National Westminster Bank has introduced a new employee
appraisal system in an effort to do away with the stress of an annual
pay and performance review.

In Britain, January is traditionally the time when banks and insurance
companies review their employees' progress in the last 12 months and
the time when performance-based pay increases or promotions are made.

But many human resource executives - and staff members - are unhappy
with having only one opportunity a year to discuss performance.

At NatWest two new measures based on quarterly meetings between staff
and their line managers have been introduced to tackle the remoteness
of the annual review.

Kelvin Moore, senior human resources executive in NatWest's UK branch
business, said the new appraisal system is aimed at creating "an
ongoing dialogue" between staff and line managers about their
individual development and their management and technical abilities.

"The view was that there needed to be far more thinking about how an
individual develops," Moore said. So the bank started a new programme,
"valuing individual performance", which is aimed at identifying
employees' development needs, possible training courses and other
activities. The programme applies to all staff every three months.

"When we talk about people's developmental needs we would seek
opportunities in their current roles to develop their skills," Moore
said.

Running along side "valuing individual performance" are "individual
performance plans" which set out what the individual should be trying
to achieve. "We are moving away from saying that the only thing that is
important is profit and increasing our focus on corporate health,"
Moore said.

"Individual performance plans" use balanced business score cards.
Similar score cards are also used for business units within the NatWest
group and for the group itself. "The individual performance plans
should be feeding into that," he said.

The balanced score card seeks results and achievements in four areas:
financial; customer service; quality; and organisational development.
"Organisational development is about how you manage and motivate to
help our staff perform," Moore said. "There are quality targets at each
branch and we use a customer service index and mystery shoppers to test
the level of service in each branch.

"If everyone is performing according to their individual plan that will
have an upward effect on the organisation. The totality of their input
will lead to improved organisation. The objective is to further
motivate that totality."

NatWest admits that a three-monthly appraisal system costs much more in
terms of paperwork, time and money, as an annual review - but Moore
believes the approach is more cost effective.

"It is more valuable to us," he said. "The only way to get sustainable
market advantage is through the collective achievement of your staff.
Under the old annual review system people often forgot towards the end
of the year what happened in the first three months. There are huge
efficiencies in our new system because it's forward looking, it helps
us plan our training and development schedule. In 1994 we were looking
ahead to our human resource needs for 1995."

Alan Ainsworth, assistant secretary of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, admitted that "in crude terms the system is very good".
But the trade unionist believes there are problems with its
implementation.

"If people are in an office that has very tight staffing levels there
are problems finding time appraisal," Ainsworth said. "There is also a
problem with people not understanding the system - both staff and
managers. Under the old system, if you got a high score, you knew that
would be reflected in your pay rise. People don't see how the new
system relates to their pay packet.

"The new system is so vague that no one is comfortable with it. Staff
are used to managers telling them what to do, they are not used to
managers talking about it."

Despite trade union misgivings, Moore claims the system is popular with
NatWest's workforce. "Our internal surveys show that our 55,000 staff
have welcomed this," he said. "They see it as something that is
developmental and training orientated. It is very important to them
that they continually update their skills and it's very healthy for the
organisation to have staff in a developmental frame of mind."

NatWest also claim that the quarterly staff appraisal has helped team
work. "We wanted to encourage local teams and managers by getting a
dialogue going between individuals and their line managers," said
Moore. "'Valuing individual performance' encourages line managers to
have conversations about staff development as part of their day to day
activities and it makes our managers more coaching orientated."

Though the new quarterly appraisal system applies to all staff, NatWest
is continuing to use its old system of measuring competencies among
senior managers.

"At NatWest group we are quite well advanced in our understanding and
use of competencies which we have developed over 40 years," Moore said.
"We have identified 11 critical competencies needed by a quite a small
percentage of high performance managers which differentiates units in
terms of performance. The real ideal is understanding them and relating
them to individual performance. Research has shown that most highly
successful managers are good at two or three competencies
- but they know which they are good at and play to their strengths.

"After identifying individual strengths and weaknesses we do not go
about a remedial exercise. It's important to find out what people are
good at, then get them better at that. To use a sporting analogy, if
you have a good goal scorer in a football team, you do not start
training him to be a goalkeeper, you work at making him a better
striker. You organise teams so that they have a range of skills between
them. A team where people have different strengths and competencies
will always perform better than a team of all rounders."

CENTRAL BANK NEEDS TO CUT JOBS

FRANCE'S CENTRAL bank needs to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs in the
next five to ten years, according to an external report by consulting
firms McKinsey, Bernard Bruhnes and Gide Loyrette Nouel.

The report commissioned by the governors of the Banque de France, has
sowed fear among the current staff of 16,500.

The consultants claim the move is needed if the Banque de France is to
become as competitive as other European central banks. The report
outlined the importance in information processing and the printing and
sorting of banknotes. At present 2,050 people are employed by the
central bank and one French banknote costs between 80 centimes and 1
franc to manufacture, a sum far higher than most other national issuing
houses.

RAPID GROWTH IN SALARIES FOR UK MANAGERS

SALARY COSTS of managerial and professional staff in the UK grew at a
faster rate in 1994 than in the previous year.

According to research by London-based Incomes Data Services (IDS), pay
awards for managerial staff between August and October this year
averaged 3.4 percent - compared with average increases of only 2.7
percent in 1993.

IDS warned that the increase in pay awards does not necessarily mean
the start of a new inflationary spiral. The independent research
organisation said relatively few pay awards are made in the third
quarter of the year. "January and April are much more significant
months," said IDS's Steve Glenn.

FIRST UNION ABANDONS COMBINED SALESFORCE

THE ONLY major US bank with a combined salesforce for its trust and
brokerage departments is abandoning the initiative after two years.

In 1992, First Union, based in Charlotte, Carolina, combined its 80
brokers and 40 salesmen from its personal trust department to create an
integrated salesforce of "personal investment counsellors" (PICs).
Since then the number of PICs has grown to 200.

But now the super-regional bank is scrapping the initiative. "The sales
were not as high as expected," a spokesman said. "In the future, we
want to go after the trust side of the business more aggressively."

The bank plans to refocus its PICs exclusively on brokerage sales and
will recruit an entirely new salesforce of 75 dedicated trust
professionals between now and January 1995. The decision comes soon

chief, in September.

STANDARD CHARTERED TO CUT STAFF

STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK's seventh-biggest bank in terms of assets,
is reducing its worldwide staff by 3,000 between now and the end of
1995.

The UK-based international bank, which employed 30,000 last year, is
well on its way to meeting that target. A bank spokesman said it has
already shed about 1,000 staff in India and Africa using voluntary
redundancy schemes.

"We are selling off non-core assets," the spokesman added. "It is a
positive move as far as the business and shareholders are concerned."

The 10 percent cut in Standard Chartered's workforce is aimed at
cutting running costs in the medium term. According to its last interim
report, Standard Chartered's operating costs rose by 7 percent in the
first half of 1994.

SWISS RE TAKES DERIVATIVES STAKE

A STRATEGIC alliance has been formed between insurance company Swiss Re
and the banking group CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse.
Swiss Re is taking a 20 percent stake in Credit Suisse Financial
Products, a derivatives joint venture between Credit Suisse and CS
First Boston.

A joint statement by the new partners said the move would"enable both
companies to benefit from each other's expertise by developing new
products, and to respond to new market developments which link
reinsurance products with banking products."

VOLUNTARY WORK BENEFITS EMPLOYEES

POSTING STAFF on charity assignments is an excellent human resource
practice, claims a UK group, Action: Employees in the Community.

Many UK banks and insurance companies have recognised the public
relations value of staff who are involved in voluntary work. But now,
they are beginning to see the training benefits too. National
Westminster Bank is one of a group of companies which are trying to
find a method of measuring these benefits.

Action claims that temporary charity assignments for junior and
middle-managers may be a way of solving the problem of how to give
staff a taste of responsibility in today's flatter organisations.

TSB uses charity work as a key part of its management training
programme and candidates for promotion are encouraged to take part in
short-term projects, such as helping charities to draw up business
plans. The bank thinks charity work is also a way of developing
leadership skills - in an environment where most people are volunteers,
dictatorial management does not work, volunteers need to be coached,
encouraged and motivated.

ATMS ON THE RISE IN JAPAN

AUTOMATIC TELLER Machine (ATM) branches in Japan are expected to
outnumber staffed branches at 11 city banks by the end of 1995.

Unmanned branches are likely to increase by 428 to 3,922 by the end of
March. At present the banks have 3,573 staffed branches.

The new ATM units will reduce running costs while extending the banks'
retail base. Japanese banks are under heavy pressure to reduce costs
because of bad debt write-offs.

BUILDING SOCIETY STAFF OPT FOR REDUNDANCY

STAFF AT the Halifax and Leeds Permanent Building Societies are said to
be queuing up for voluntary redundancy payments.

The two building societies' plan to merge and then convert to a public
limited company with full banking licence (see HRBI 18) has been
approved by the UK authorities. President of the board of trade Michael
Heseltine has said he will not refer the planned move to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.

The societies hope to reduce staff numbers after the merger through
natural wastage - but, according to their staff associations, many
employees are hoping to benefit from the voluntary redundancy packages
on offer.

Two factors are given for the popularity of the redundancy schemes: the
packages on offer are generous, for example, Leeds staff who succeed in
volunteering for redundancy would receive two and a half times their
annual salary in a lump sum; and with overall numbers employed in the
building society sector increasing, many staff feel they will easily
find employment elsewhere.

The members of both societies will vote on the merger proposal this
spring. If it goes ahead, there is already speculation that a further
merger with TSB Group may be in the offing. The advantage of such a
move is that it would immediately give the Halifax a large number of
new current account holders who do not yet have a relationship with
either building society.

FRANCE: REFORM OF BANKING HOURS FALLS THROUGH

A MUCH hoped for reform of bank opening hours in France has collapsed
after all five unions involved failed to agree with the proposals.
Talks on the issue lasted for almost a year, and at one stage, a
breakthrough seemed likely (see HRBI 17).

Since 1937 French bank opening hours have been restricted by a decree
limiting freedoms that banks elsewhere take for granted. For example:
shift working is restricted - 9 am to 5 pm is still the general rule;
and many banks are barred from opening on Saturdays.

The restrictions applied to members of the Association Francaise des
Banques (AFB). But three key players in France's financial sector are
not AFB members and so are not limited by the decree.

These are: CCP, the banking arm of La Poste, which opens 59 hours a
week and employs shift workers; Credit Agricole which was originally a
farmers' bank and was given greater flexibility to serve rural
customers; and the co-operative and savings banks, which were not
regarded as full banks in 1937.

The AFB argues that its member banks are losing business to those
financial institutions which are exempt from the decree. In the last
ten years savings banks have expanded steadily, while AFB members have
been forced to rationalise and cut jobs.

The decree could have been annulled by the labour minister using laws
aimed at removing job creation barriers. Instead, he called on the
banks to negotiate with the unions.

But the talks got off to a poor start. Early on two unions, the
Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and Force Ouvriere (FO),
launched anti-reform campaigns that painted a picture of employees
working around the clock, seven days a week. This left the AFB with
only three unions with which to negotiate: the managers' union, the
SNB/CGC; the CFDT; and the CFTC. These unions, refusing to discuss a
repeal of the 1937 decree, said they would only consider its revision.

After a brief deadlock, the AFB agreed to discuss revision and a
30-month trial period ending in November 1997 was agreed. The three
unions said if the trial lead to job creation it would become
permanent, while the AFB offered to cut working hours by 20 percent for
those working later than 6 pm.

But the proposal collapsed when the CFTC claimed that staff incentives
were not good enough to guarantee that employee participation would
indeed be strictly voluntary and the AFB refused to include
a"volunteers only" clause in the agreement.

The SNB/CGC also wanted more detailed negotiations with individual
banks, a move the AFB said would delay the trial by a year.

By December, the AFB's only hope was the CFDT, which still seemed to
favour reform. Additional concessions were given, including one where
employees received payment for 39 hours' work, while only working a 35
hour week. But the final nail in the coffin came on December 15, when
more than 60 percent of the CFDT's members voted to reject the
proposal.

FRANCE:  UAP FAVOURS PART-TIMERS

EUROPE'S SECOND-largest insurer, UAP, has signed a "contract for state
employment" with the French government.

The deal signed by UAP president Jacques Friedmann and labour minister
Michel Giraud means that an agreement made by the company last May to
introduce voluntary part-time working for administrative personnel at
UAP will go ahead.

The accord aims to put in place a job share scheme that will take
advantage of the new legislation on part-time work, which UAP said will
"increase employment but not reduce the company's volume of work".

UAP hopes to create 400 new jobs in 1995 through encouraging existing
staff to work part time or to take "progressive retirement".

The company said it hopes, on the one hand, to contribute to the
collective effort to fight unemployment and, on the other hand, to
correct its "age pyramid" by taking on younger staff who will bring new
skills to the company. In the meantime, employees aged over 55 will be
offered a "progressive departure" programme which will allow them to
pass on their expertise to younger employees through a newly
established tutoring system.

Always keen to be seen as innovative in matters of human resources, UAP
wishes "to demonstrate that job sharing is the way forward, viable on
the ground and beneficial to all involved: the company, the employees
and the group".

STAFF SUPPORT SCHEMES CATCH ON WITH INSURERS

MOST NORTH American insurance companies now have formal staff support
schemes aimed at helping employees overcome personal problems,
according to the Life Office Management Association (LOMA).

The schemes, described by LOMA as employee assistance programmes
(EAPS), are designed to identify and resolve those employee problems
which may lead to reduced productivity. The problems may be
work-related or domestic. According to LOMA, the EAPs address issues
including: personal health; marriage and family; money management/debt;
alcohol/chemical dependency; legal problems; or job stress.

A LOMA survey of 145 US and Canadian life and health insurers found
that about two-thirds or respondents offered EAPs and saw them as a
method that reduced absenteeism and improved productivity and work
quality.

Eighty percent of companies which provide EAPs do so through subsidised
counselling services. More than 90 percent of them also extend their
services to employees' immediate families.

Responsibility for EAPs usually rests with human resources departments,
however, the survey found that about 80 percent of the companies with
EAPs provide them through outside agencies.

According to LOMA, assistance with marital/family problems was the most
commonly used service, with psychological assistance running a close
second - particularly for problems related to clinical depression.
Alcohol and substance abuse, the original impetus for the development
of EAPs in the early-1980s, ranked fourth on the list of frequently
used treatments.

PORTUGAL: BPSM'S OVERSTAFFING CURE: MORE BRANCHES

THE FIFTH-LARGEST bank in Portugal plans to increase its branch network
by more than 50 percent in the next five years and thus help solve a
chronic overstaffing problem.

Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor (BPSM) is now back in the hands of the
Champalimaud family, 19 years after it was nationalised in 1975. BPSM's
former owners Antonio Champalimaud and his son Luis, now hold 80
percent of the bank after paying Esc1,528 ($10) per share for 24.4
million BPSM shares. Their bid was considerably higher than the
Esc1,300 offered by the only other bidder in the reprivatisation, Banco
Financia.

BPSM's return to the Champalimaud empire, which includes one of the
country's largest insurance group, Cia de Seguros Mundial Confianca,
creates the biggest financial group in Portugal.

As if this was not enough, Luis Champalimaud, in an interview with the
weekly newspaper Expresso, said that a massive expansion programme is
planned for the bank. This covered not only increased credit and
deposits, but also a huge increase in the number of bank branches and a
corresponding increase in employees.

BPSM currently has about 220 branches, and plans to increase this
number by at least a further 130 over the next five years.

Raising cash for the expansion programme - the price tag was not
revealed - will be done in three ways according to Luis Champalimaud.
Firstly, BPSM will embark on an aggressive campaign to increase
deposits. Secondly, the bank plans a Esc20 billion capital increase
over the next two years. Thirdly, funds from a similar sized capital
increase in Mundial Confianca will be transferred to the bank.

Luis Champalimaud dismissed worries concerning overbanking: "It is true
that in some places there is, or could be, too high a concentration of
bank branches, but at the end of the day it's a case of survival of the
fittest - and we are fitter than most."

Analysts point out that BPSM has a massive potential network of
branches at its disposal via Mundial Confianca and add that the
conversion of any number of these insurance offices into allfinanz
branches could be done at a minimum cost. "Banco Mello is expanding on
the back of insurer Imperio in precisely this manner," said Jose Freire
at Banco Espirito Santo.

The move would also aid BPSM's overstaffing problems - when Banco
Comercial Portugues bid for BPSM last year, it said it would slash
BPSM's workforce by at least a third - because existing employees can
be relocated to new branches, avoiding a big and expensive recruitment
campaign.

As Luis Champalimaud said:"We have too many staff at the moment. That
means that we either reduce the number or we find work for them to do.
We are opting for the latter."

The Champalimaud family is also looking to expand in other areas and
has made public its interest in acquiring the 26 percent indirect stake
held by Banco Espanol de Credito in Banco Totta & Acores, which the
Portuguese government is desperately trying to win back from the
Spanish bank.

CONSULTANTS ARGUE FOR FLEXIBLE BENEFITS

FLEXIBLE BENEFIT programmes can help organisations control costs, but
many companies have yet to realise its advantages, according to
consulting firm Towers Perrin.

The consultancy says flexibility in benefits is on the increase,
particularly when it comes to pensions and company cars, and the
financial industry is leading the way. But it adds that many companies
are unwilling to make their pay and conditions more flexible - because
they believe it will increase administrative costs.

Towers Perrin's conclusions are based on a survey of 400 UK companies
employing 2 million staff, carried out in conjunction with the
Confederation of British Industry.

Helen Freeman, a Towers Perrin principal, said: "Motivations to
implement benefit flexibility centre on either or both of the
following: the desire to improve employees' appreciation of the
benefits provided, maximising the value to the company of the amount
spent on benefits; and the desire to control benefit costs."

Twenty nine percent of the companies in the survey were in the
financial services industry and Towers Perrin found that in the banking
and insurance sector there is greater employee choice in compensation
packages, particularly when it comes to pensions. For example, 24
percent of the financial companies surveyed offered pension benefits on
a flexible basis, compared with 17 percent of non-financial companies.

This may be because the financial sector has a better understanding of
pensions and greater access to a wider range of pension schemes.

"Many companies do not consider pensions appropriate for flex and may
be missing an opportunity to address one of the most expensive employee
benefit programmes they offer," Freeman said.

When it comes to company cars, 74 percent of financial companies
offered employees a choice between a car and cash, compared with 62
percent of non-financial companies. Eighty percent of financial
companies allowed employees to chose a higher value car by contributing
towards the cost of it, an option available to only 56 percent of
non-financial firms.

"The trend towards flexibility within car and pension arrangements may
reflect the fact that these are often the highest-cost employee
benefits," said Freeman. "Companies may be recognising that, if flex is
to have a significant cost-containment effect, these benefits must be
included."

Other areas of possible flexibility within compensation packages
include: company parking; subsidised cafeteria; luncheon vouchers;
subsidised health club memberships; company gyms; annual health
screening; dental care; private petrol allowances; travelling expenses;
share ownership; group discounts; employee, accident insurance; loans;
subsidised mortgages; school fees; company creches; and child care
vouchers.

The survey found that on-site creches and child care vouchers were the
least popular forms of supplementary benefit offered to employees,
available at only 7 percent and 5 percent of companies respectively.

Towers Perrin also found that giving employees greater choice about
their length of annual holidays is also unpopular, though companies in
the financial sector are a little more flexible on this issue.

"Few companies allow or intend to allow employees either to buy or sell
holidays in exchange for cash or other benefits," said Freeman. "This
may be because allowing employees to sell holidays is a cash cost to
the company, which may not be made up in increased productivity.
However, 57 percent of respondents do allow employees to carry forward
unused holiday (72 percent of financial companies) and 37 percent of
respondents overall allow employees to take unpaid time off to extend
their holiday."

Reviewing the survey, Freeman concluded: "Cost containment within
private medical programmes is emerging as an issue, presumably because
of recent double-digit increases in health-care costs. Benefits with
little or no cost to companies (such as parking and supplemental
disability insurance) are increasingly included in benefit programmes.

"However, despite the increase in benefits flexibility, and in its
perceived advantages, companies continue to express concern.
Administrative complexity and cost tops the list of perceived
disadvantages. This concern must be weighed against the advantages. It
is the experiences of companies who implement flex that will determine
whether a role for this approach is secured more broadly within benefit
programmes."

Another Towers Perrin principal, Marc Hommel, went even further: he
sees flexible benefits as one of the main trends in employee
compensation for the future.

"It is very new. It is going to increase," he said. "I would say the UK
is between the US and Continental Europe when it comes to progress in
this area. In the US, there is very high flexibility and choice in
benefits, under the banner of employee empowerment.

"On the continent, it is right on the other extreme. There, companies
are seen as much more paternalistic. Employees like their employers to
make all sorts of decisions for them. For example, in France, when it
comes to holidays, it is August or nothing. In countries like Germany
the only flexibility on pensions is whether you accept a lump sum or an
annuity, there is greater flexibility on pensions in the UK.

"But we are beginning to see things change on the continent. That is
being driven by recession and high cost of employment. The employment
costs currently experienced by European firms is unsustainable.

"Unions and works councils have been very anti-choice - they are into
collective bargaining and agreements made with works councils in
Holland, Germany, Belgium and France cover very senior employees. But
the workforce is changing and we are seeing an end to the job for life.

"We are beginning to see larger German companies looking at cost
control. They want to reduce costs but not loose employee appreciation.
Rather than provide all employee benefits en masse, you can offer a
choice. Offering choice makes you an attractive employer at very little
extra cost."

PUTTING AN END TO RECRUITMENT HASSLE?

NEW SOFTWARE developed by a Californian company may reduce recruitment
headaches for human resource executives.

Resumix, a world leader in electronic systems used for processing
application forms and resumes, recently announced partnership
agreements with Oracle, ADP, RAMCO Systems, Integral, Decisis, ESSENCE
Systems and Worksmart- Technologies.

A new Resumix product, known as OpenAccess, was the catalyst for the
partnerships. OpenAccess is a set of flexible computer interface tools
which help automate and synchronise data exchange between the Resumix's
processing systems and other human resource management systems (HRMSs).

Resumix spokesman Joseph Hnilo explained that OpenAccess will make
databases more easily accessible to HR system suppliers. Resumix's own
knowledge base contains over 100,000 rules and concepts related to
recruitment in specific industries, he said.

"The Resumix knowledge base applies an objective standard of
measurement to job candidates, and can therefore eliminate the
subjectivity in the selection process," Hnilo said.

"Our system is not designed to tell people who to hire. But we enable
recruiters to quickly and accurately assess candidates' skills and
qualifications - that helps companies save time and money."

The Resumix system standardises job applications and resumes by
categorising candidates' previous job titles and assigning numerical
values to candidates' skills. Client firms can enter their hiring needs
into the Resumix system to find the best matched candidate for a
particular position. It is a process which, according to Hnilo, takes
only minutes.

Job candidates' resumes can be scanned into a database using fax or
electronic mail. The system then captures an exact electronic image of
the resume, making the recruitment process "paperless".

Paperless recruitment has decided advantages for human resource
departments in large US companies, as many receive thousands of
applications for hundreds of different jobs every year and each resume
must be kept on file for a set period of time. For example, Californian
state law requires companies to keep resumes for every job application
for at least two years.

Once a job application has been scanned into the Resumix system, a text
file is created so that it can be transmitted anywhere electronically.
The system also automatically extracts information from job
applications, including listed skills and work experience, without the
need for additional data entry by client companies.

Resumix is currently targeting the financial services industry, and its
list of clients includes Bank of America, ITT Hartford, Salomon
Brothers, Principal Mutual Life Insurance, Wells Fargo Bank, and
American Express.

Founded in 1988, the company sold its services mainly to high-tech
firms during its first three years of operations. Now its market
includes the financial services industry, telecommunications companies,
universities and colleges and even manufacturers.

"Banking has a lot of similarities to many of our earlier users," said
Hnilo. "Like high tech companies, banking requires a great degree of
skill specificity, from portfolio managers to tellers.

"Our system can help banks in re-engineering efforts. For example,
banks can apply the software internally, to analyse their current
employees in terms of matching them to future projects and planning."

Noting that the bigger international banks are moving aggressively into
Asia and Latin America, Hnilo added: "The system can also be used by
banks or insurers who are expanding into new technology or geographic
markets, to find staff for their new locations."

Because it works with many different data entry systems, Resumix
OpenAccess allows recruitment data to be freely imported from HRMSs,
E-mail, electronic kiosks, application forms scanning systems, and
groupware such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange.

This versatility attracted its current list of marketing partners,
including another Californian company, Oracle, who is a leading
supplier of human resource solutions. Resumix's OpenAccess will operate
with Oracle's Cooperative Application Initiative (CAI) programme,
creating a resume scanning and processing system that will be offered
with Oracle's HRMS.

Oracle's vice-president of Migration Services and Worldwide Alliance,
Marc Herbert, said the Resumix partnership will enable his company to
provide "fast and effective management and deployment of human
resources to help companies react quickly and respond appropriately to
changes and opportunities in today's demanding market."

Automatic Data Processing (ADP) will market Resumix to interface with
its HR software. ADP, America's largest provider of outsourced payroll
processing services, selected Resumix to enhance its human resource
management systems.

ADP's director of Strategic Alliances, Elaine Myrback, said her company
was impressed with "both the functionality of the Resumix system and
the flexibility of its data exchange capabilities".

A private company, Resumix posted a 130 percent revenue growth from
1992 to 1993, and its financial services base, according to Hnilo, now
stands at"5 percent and growing".

TAPPING ASIA'S MASSIVE POOL OF TALEN

Banks and insurance companies may find it easier to recruit bilingual
employees in their fast growing Asian markets, thanks to a database
being developed by a US recruitment company.

International Career Information (ICI) of New Jersey, claims that its
database of bilingual Asian college students in the US in unique.  The
database holds details on 25,000 undergraduate students from countries
including Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam and Thailand, who are all studying at US
universities.

The database's customers include retail banks Citibank and National
Westminster Bank, and investment banks such as Bankers Trust and
Goldman Sachs.

According to ICI's director of operations, Wayne Allen, the database
can be tailored to meet the companies' specific hiring needs for a fee
raning from $1,500 to $3,000. Clients can be provided with a list of
possible job candidates including details on their natinalities, their
educational achievement and work experience.

"A bank, for example, can select a certain subject major, such as
finace, computer or technology major," Allen said.  "Once we receive
the criteria from the bank, we can send each qualified student a
targeted, proactive notice, making them aware of the bank's interest in
their qualifications".

Allen explained that ICI is the international arm of a Japanese
recruitment firm, Recruit Company, and has traditionally kept track of
Japanese graduate and undergraduate students studying in the US.
However, duirng the past two years, ICI has widened its remit to track
the progress of all Asian students in the US.

Now the company is developing a database on mid-career executives
interested in returning to Asia, Alled said.

A recent ICI survey of 2,300 Asians studying in the US revealed that a
large majority - 89 per cent - preferred to work for a foreign
multinational rather than an Asian-based firm.  This, according to
Allen, creates an opportunity for US and European banks and insurers
that want to recruit the best staff for their new Asian operations.

Most of the leading US financial houses, including JP Morgan, Merrill
Lynch, Citibank and Chase Manhattan, are rushing to establish offices
in the fast-growing economies of Singapore, Thailand and China.

US insurance companies are also moving agressively into the region.
Jeffrey Malkovsky, vice-president and chief financial officer of CIGNA
International, predicted that Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and
Thailand will offer the greatest near-term opportunities for insurance
companies.

Allen contends that ICI is well placed to meet the requirements of
multinationals in Asia.

The company unveiled its database system at the Pan Asia MBA Job Fair
last September in New York, where it linked up a personal computer with
one in Singapore.  The cross-Pacific link-up allowed corporate
recruiters in Singapore to interview Asian students attending the job
fair.

ICI plans a similar intercontinental link-up at the Pan Asian
Engineering and Computer Science Job Fair, which is scheduled for
February 24 in San Jose, California

TRAINING KIT KEEPS FUTURE LEADERS INDOORS

OUTDOOR PURSUIT exercises have long been recognised as valuable
training methods, particularly in developing leadership and teamworking
ability - but the days of military style exercises in the great
outdoors may be numbered.

Outdoor pursuits are expensive in terms of money and staff time.
Another drawback, particularly in the middle of winter, is that not
every prospective business leader reacts favourably to the prospect of
several days living in the wilds. Plus there is the risk of losing
valuable staff time through injury or illness caused by exposure to the
elements.

Now UK consulting firm Martin Thompson Associates has developed a more
comfortable and less costly alternative. It is a large scale
construction kit, similar to oversized pieces of Lego or Mecanno, that
can be used indoors and outdoors.

The kit, a collection of plastic pipes, joints, platforms and wheels,
weighing 22kg and packed in two bags each measuring 30 x 42 x 55 cm,
was originally developed by name partner Martin Thompson two years ago
as a way of marketing his consultancy services. Since then, the kit has
taken on a product life of its own.

"We only expected to sell about 50 a year," Thompson said. "In the last
two years, we have sold 500. Our international sales include sales to
France, Switzerland, Germany, India, Dubai, Hong Kong and Canada."

In the UK, the list of clients includes: Abbey National, Barclays,
Lloyds Bank, Hill Samuel and Zurich Life.

The kit is "all you want from a training resource", said Shaun Lang, a
training centre manager with Yorkshire Bank. "I would unreservedly
recommend the resource to anyone involved in the training and
development of managers and leaders."

Colin Keast of Hill Samuel also described it as "the best #480" that
his firm had spent on a training resource.

Thompson has developed six training exercises using the kit, he claims
that each exercises raises basic leadership and teamwork issues,
including: listening, planning, decision making, giving and receiving
commitment.

Additionally, Thompson claims that each of the exercises, focuses on a
specific area: customer orientation; team objectives versus individual
objectives; inter-group working; communications; roles of team members
and leader empowerment; and negotiating win/win solutions.

For example, one of the exercises, Over The Bridge, calls on a team to
build a bridge and a vehicle that can pass over it. But teams must be
aware of customer needs and wants, and should ideally ask their
training facilitator for customer criteria.

"It is amazing how many teams - particularly those from a marketing
background - who assume that there may be any limitations on what the
vehicle may be use for or what kind of span the bridge must cross,"
Thompson said."Typically, people do not ask questions, they do
everything from a straight forward production point of view and have no
concept of what the customer required. In the discussion afterwards,
the importance of the customer is really brought home to them."

A group discussion lead by a trainer follows each exercise and
participants are encouraged to spend time individually considering how
the lessons learnt can be applied effectively in their place of work.

EUROPE: BANK STAFF FALL DOWN ON FUND TRANSFERS

BANK BRANCH staff in Luxembourg, the UK and Italy are the most
competent in Europe when it comes to arranging cross-border payments
and money transfers, according to research carried out for the European
Commission.

Surprisingly, bank staff in the Netherlands - a country with a
distinguished history in foreign trade and whose people are
traditionally regarded as the most multilingual in Europe -scored the
worst, with a rating of "below adequate".

The survey of 352 branches of 165 banks was carried out by UK
consultancy Retail Banking Research on behalf of the commission, which
wanted to gauge the transparency of banking charges and conditions when
consumers transfer money from one European Union member state to
another.

The commission believes transparency in cross-border banking is vital
to the future of Europe. It stated recently: "The full benefits of the
single market will only be achieved if it is possible to transfer money
as rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the [EU] to another."

Based on the results of the survey and an earlier one carried out in
1993, the commission has decided to introduce a directive in October
that would help regulate the area and improve banks' results in the
field.

That directive was opposed by the European Banking Federation, which
wanted the banking community to have its own voluntary code of conduct.
But the commission has put its foot down, after Retail Banking Research
found widespread double charging for cross-border fund transfers.

In 36 percent of cases, recipients were charged by intermediary and/or
beneficiary banks, though fund transfer instructions stated that all
fees had already been paid by the fund originators.

The European Banking Federation's general secretary, Nikolaus Bomcke,
claimed that double charging is an unavoidable part of sending
international payment. He said most sending institutions warned
customers that they could not guarantee that a charge would not be
levied on fund receivers. "We do not control the transfer chain," he
said. "Clearly, there is room for improvement, but I believe strongly
in a market solution."

Whether a market solution can solve the dismal performance of Dutch
banks remains to be seen. Banking staff in the Netherlands were found
to be the worst in Europe when it came to general helpfulness. And they
were the second worst when it came to providing customers with
information about the various options available for transferring funds
across borders; how long a transfer might take; and how much it would
cost.

The survey found that many Dutch banks "were reluctant to give cost
information to the researcher, since he did not have an account with
the bank".

Bank staff in Luxembourg scored the best when it came to providing
customers with the options available to them, the time it would take to
complete a transfer; and their overall helpfulness. But, amazingly,
"branch staff often misquoted costs. Many misread brochure details,
others omitted to mention that an exchange commission was payable".

UK branch staff scored the best when it came to quoting charges - but
they benefited from a very simple flat fee charging system, with each
bank's charges ranging from Ecu15 ($18) to Ecu45 for urgent transfers,
and Ecu10 to Ecu26 for standard transfers.

British banks also warned fund originators that electing to pay
beneficiary charges did not guarantee that the amount sent would be
credited to the beneficiary's account without further deductions. One
branch staffer told a researcher "Spanish banks charge the beneficiary
even if the sender requests to pay all costs."

"Virtually all" UK branches said they would be able to trace a
transfer, if delays occurred. In many other countries, branch staff
denied that transfers sometimes were lost in the system.

When researchers approached bank counters in Belgium, Denmark, Spain,
France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the first member of
staff contacted handled the inquiry most cases. Which points to a
greater level of staff training and work flexibility in those seven
countries.

In the five other EU countries, researchers were more frequently
referred to another member of staff, or a specialist department.
Researchers were asked to make an appointment to carry out their
transaction in only three countries - in 5 percent of cases in France,
4 percent in Portugal, and 2 percent in Italy.

MIDLAND GAINS STRENGTH FROM DIVERSITY

Midland Bank was singled out for praise by the UK Equal Opportunities
Commission for its policies aimed at ending discrimination in the work
place. Cian Molloy looks at some of the bank's initiatives

CYNICS MAY describe equal opportunity statements as empty words - but
not at Midland Bank where UK regulators have praised its equal
opportunity schemes.

The bank has a dedicated equal opportunities department with human
resource executives in charge of equal opportunities in gender, race
and disability.

There are good business reasons for their approach, according to
Midland's equal opportunities executive on race, Andie Constantinides.
"Equal opportunities is about diversity and reflecting the community,"
she said. "The more our staff reflect the community they are working
in, the more they will understand that community and the services that
our customers need.

"Diversity also helps teams. Decision making is better when the people
making decisions come from different backgrounds. Every individual has
their own thing to bring to an organisation. The more diverse the
individuals in an organisation, the more diverse the skills and
qualities that they will bring."

Official Midland policy states: "We seek to employ a workforce which
reflects the diverse community at large, because we value the
individual contribution of people, irrespective of sex, age, marital
status, disability, sexuality, race, colour, religion, ethnic or
national origin.

"We will treat all Midland employees with dignity and respect and we
will provide a working environment free from unlawful discrimination,
victimisation or harassment."

The bank goes further to state that if any act by an employee breaches
its equal opportunities policy, the matter "will be taken seriously, be
fully investigated, and may be subject to disciplinary procedures".

Indeed, Midland has become so competent in investigating cases of
alleged discrimination or harassment, that the bank is now marketing
its training courses in investigating complaints of racial and sexual
harassment.

The bank has its own Disability Equality Action Group which meets
regularly. It is a panel of disabled employees who provide management
with feedback on issues affecting disabled people.

To encourage job applications from members of ethnic minorities Midland
has been running a fellowship programme since 1991 where final year
college students are offered work experience placements during their
summer holidays. Midland audits its graduate selection process for
equal opportunity purposes and in 1993 16 percent of its graduate
intake came from ethnic minority backgrounds.

At present 5 percent of Midland's domestic workforce are from ethnic
minority backgrounds. The bank regularly holds "focus groups" with its
ethnic minority staff to identify new initiatives in this area and to
get feedback about their experience of working for the bank.

The director of the equal opportunities unit, Anne Watts, is also a
founder member of a new government-funded initiative, Race for
Opportunity, being set up later this year. Race for Opportunity will be
similar to another national initiative, Opportunity 2000, which is
aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of women in the British
workplace by the end of the century.

Midland was also involved in the launch of Opportunity 2000 in 1991.
Now women represent 21.5 percent of all managers, compared with only
7.5 percent ten years ago.

Like most British banks, the majority of Midland's part-time staff are
women, 96 percent. But even part-timers who fit their hours of work
around school schedules can run into home care or baby-sitting
difficulties during school holidays. Because of this, the bank runs
holiday play schemes in 40 different locations dotted around the
country.

"Play schemes form a natural extension to the bank's nursery provision,
allowing employees to work during school holidays, confident that their
children are being looked after in a caring and creative environment,"
said Watts. "The rationale is the same as with Midland's nurseries -
the recruitment and retention of high calibre experienced staff in a
cost effective manner."

The bank does not subsidise its holiday play schemes, but it provides
nursery facilities in partnerships with public sector organisations and
staff, with a satisfactory performance rating, have access to over 100
nurseries.

"Although the strategy is business driven, the implementation is wholly
child centred. Children with special needs will be accommodated
wherever possible," said Watts.

"The provision of nurseries has had an impact on retention of staff. In
1989, only 30 percent of women returned after maternity leave, but by
1993 this figure had risen to 75 percent. The profile of this group
shows that typically they have worked for the bank for at least ten
years, have received a considerable amount of training and are
experienced and effective employees. This represents retention of a
very valuable resource."

Five days a year of family leave are available to all employees with
emergency caring responsibilities. Family leave covers care of sick
children and other sick or disabled dependents, recognising that with
Britain's ageing population more staff members are caring for elderly
relatives.

As well as getting the best from staff, Midland's equal opportunities
are also aimed at improving customer service.

Midland's marketing department has appointed a manager to develop
business with ethnic minorities and the bank also runs a training
course for managers to heighten their awareness of ethnic minority
business issues. The bank is also running a pilot scheme in six of its
branches aimed at improving the service offered to ethnic minority
customers.

During customer focus training staff are taught how to welcome disabled
customers and Midland is a member of Britain's Employers Forum on
Disability.

Induction loop systems have been installed in all of the bank's
branches to help hearing aid users and copies of customer brochures are
available in braille, large print, and on audio cassettes versions for
those with loss of vision.

A COLLECTION OF FAMILIAR TALES

Job cuts were again a recurring theme in the financial services
industry last year. Cian Molloy looks back at these and other human
resources issues that made the headlines in 1994

JANUARY

EIGHT SENIOR executives of Gota Bank in Scandinavia were taken to court
by the Bankstodsnamnden, the government's bank support authority.

Gota Bank was one of the bank's worst hit by the Scandinavian banking
crisis and the government was seeking damages for losses caused by poor
lending decisions made in 1990.

The previous year, the bank support authority had threatened Nordbanken
with similar legal action, but that case was settled out of court.

BARCLAYS BANK in the UK implemented its first major compulsory
redundancy scheme in the bank's history.

WORKERS AT Spain's fifth-largest bank, Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto), were promised there would be no drastic job cuts in the
foreseeable future.

The promise was made by Banesto's new chairman, Alfredo Saenz, after
the bank was taken over by Spain's central bank at the end of December
1993.

FEBRUARY

US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton gave his support to calls for international
agreements strengthening workers' bargaining powers.

While on a visit to Europe, Clinton praised the European Social Charter
and expressed the view that some of its provisions should be extended
to workers in the Third World. "We must create more jobs," he said.
"But if more jobs involve giving up standards for which people have
fought for in the past, this could be very dangerous. It could result
in the collapse of the middle class or working class in our countries."

A THREE-year pay deal was agreed in Ireland between the government, the
Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Employers and
Business Confederation.

The deal covered bank staff because the Irish Bank Officials
Association (IBOA) is now a member of the ICTU. IBOA general secretary
Ciaran Ryan was elected to the ICTU's executive in 1993.

The IBOA joined the ICTU following its traumatic strike action in 1992
when many IBOA members crossed official union pickets and banks were
able to keep branches open, thanks to new technology. Previously, while
outside the ICTU, the IBOA had been successful in winning pay increases
higher than those achieved by unions in other sectors.

PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE Company of America launched a multi-media
interactive training scheme, claiming it would improve staff
recruitment, selection and retention.

AMERICA'S SECOND-largest bank, Chase Manhattan, offered a stock option
to all its employees as part of a performance based reward scheme.

Every employee were to receive an option on 400 shares, priced $35.50
each, but the shares were unavailable for purchase unless certain
performance-based conditions were met.

The bank's chairman Thomas Labreque said: "The option grant will align
the interests of our worldwide staff and stockholders, and provide
employees with a strong incentive to perform at levels that exceed
stockholders expectations."

MARCH

SPAIN'S THIRD-largest bank, Banco Central Hispano (BCH), announced a
staff reduction and branch closure programme aimed at cutting running
costs by Pta85 billion ($700 million) over five years.

It is planned that about 3,000 staff will be shed and 400 of the banks
2,700 branches will be closed by the end of 1995. The bank was formed
in 1991 through the merger of Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamerica.
At the time of the merger, the bank employed 31,472 people and analysts
calculated that it was overstaffed by as much as 40 percent.

Between 1991 and 1994, 750 branches were closed and 5,000 jobs shed
through early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.

THE NUMBER of Americans who telecommute - work from home using
computers linked to their offices - increased to 8 million, double the
number in 1990.

Improved technology, the Los Angeles earthquake, and bad weather on the
east coast of the US were cited as reasons for the increase in
telecommuting.

APRIL

UNICE, THE European employers organisation, reckoned that 3,000
European companies in the financial sector will be affected by the EU
directive on European Works Councils.

The directive affects all companies in the EU which employ more than
1,000 staff members with at least 100 staff members employed in a
second EU state.

HUMAN RESOURCE managers have little effect on the quality of industrial
relations, according to research by the London School of Economics.
After surveying data from the UK's Workplace Industrial Relations
Survey, researchers Sue Fernie, David Metcalfand Stephen Woodland,
concluded that human resource executives" do not improve the climate of
employee-management relations and probably detract from it".

BUT HUMAN resource managers do have a role in preventing employee
fraud, according to a director of an international risk management
consultancy.

Chris Barrett of WBK International said that during fraud
investigations it is often found that staff sense something had been
amiss, but feel they cannot voice their concerns because of
unapproachable management.

"I'm not advocating a police state," Barrett said, "but simply
suggesting that management should be readily accessible to employees."

Barrett also suggested that human resource managers develop better
systems for detecting changes in employee's personal behaviour,
including unexplained new-found wealth or increasingly frequent visits
to casinos. "By far the biggest category of employee fraudster is the
previously honest employee facing a change in the circumstances of
their lives," he said.

MAY

AN HRBI survey of European branch opening hours found that Turkish
banks stayed open longest, averaging 46.9 hours a week.

Banks in nearby Cyprus had Europe's shortest opening hours, averaging
only 21.3 hours a week. Swiss banks were ranked second with 42.6 hours
a week, while Poland with 41.9 hours, the Netherlands with 39.1 hours,
and the UK with 37 hours, were ranked third, fourth and fifth.

PAY RISES for bank staff in the UK were higher than the national
average in the first quarter of 1994.

Bank personnel saw their pay packets increase by an average of 2.6
percent in the first three months of the year, compared with a national
average for the private sector of 2.4 percent, according to the
Confederation of British Industry. The biggest wage increase was at
Lloyds Bank where the average increase based on merit was 4.5 percent.

BANC ONE Corporation in the US announced a plan to cut its running
costs by hundreds of millions of dollars without resorting to layoffs.

Banc One's chairman John McCoy said the bank planned to save $150
million in 1994 and $200 million in 1995 by using new technology to
streamline back office operations. But he added that Banc One would
redeploy staff instead of laying them off. "For example, we see an
increasing demand in retail credit, with a downturn in mortgage
financing. Therefore, we will move now to redeploy the workforce
towards retail credit, and away from refinancing."

JUNE

A SPANISH bank was left reeling by head hunters after it lost ten of
its most senior executives.

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) was robbed of some of its most valuable
employees following Banco Santander's acquisition of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto).

The BBV executives had been seconded for four months to Banesto while
it was being administered by the Bank of Spain. Poaching the BBV staff
after buying Banesto had obvious advantages for Banco Santander as the
move caused little disruption to Santander's management hierarchy and
the head-hunted staff all have experience of running the newly
purchased bank.

METROPOLITAN LIFE, one of the biggest insurance companies in the US,
shed 1,000 of its 13,000 salesforce after being fined $20 million for
mis-selling life insurance policies.

CREDIT LYONNAIS, the troubled French bank, announced plans to shed 10
percent of its workforce over three years in a move to boost
productivity. The bank's president Jean Peyrelevade set a target for
zero growth in running expenses in 1994.

SEPTEMBER

ITALIAN BANKS were hit by strike action following a break-down in talks
between employers and trade unions about the financial industry's
annual collective agreement.

Assicredito, the bank employers' federation, offered a monthly pay
increase of L83,000 ($53), but that was not good enough for the trade
unions who demanded a monthly increase of L128,000 backdated to January
1993.

THE BRITISH Bankers' Association claimed that banks were no longer
cutting their branch networks. These conclusions were based on a
comparison with 1993 which showed little change. But in the last decade
Barclays had closed 700 branches, Lloyds closed 400, Midland 600 and
National Westminster 700.

OCTOBER

AMERICAN EXPRESS said it planned to shed 6,000 staff in the next two
years.

The move, which involved compulsory redundancies, was aimed at cutting
the company's costs by $500 million a year. Most of the staff affected,
4,000, were US based. Out of the 2,000 employees being shed worldwide,
400 were in Europe working in support functions including legal, public
relations, and human resource offices.

Amex chairman Harvey Golub said: "These efforts will build a stronger,
more successful organisation that will move us closer to achieving our
vision of becoming the world's most respected service brand."

FORTIS AMEV launched a performance pay scheme for its back office
staff.

The Dutch parent of the Fortis insurance and banking group, Fortis AMEV
already had a profit share scheme in operation. The new performance pay
scheme, payable this summer, could be worth up to 15 percent of salary
for some employees.

TSB BECAME one of the first UK financial institutions to switch its
insurance salesmen from commission-based income to salaries in advance
of new disclosure rules coming into operation in the UK at the start of
1995.

TSB ALSO said it was closing 17 percent of its branch network over a
12-month period. The UK's eighth-largest bank by assets had already
closed 100 outlets in 1994 when it announced that another 200 branches
were to close to cut its total number of branches to 1,000.

John Townsend of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union said he
believed TSB was aiming to prune its network further to 800 branches.

NOVEMBER

ITALIAN BANKS and trade unions signed a four-year collective agreement
after a long-running industrial dispute.

Naturally, both sides claimed victory. Assicredito, the bankers'
federation, won concessions on hiring part-time workers, opening hours
and the use of annual bonuses which were brought in line with
productivity and bank profitability. The unions won bonuses for staff
who work Saturdays and an agreement that 12 percent of vacancies would
be kept for bank personnel who are "between jobs".

ABN AMRO, the biggest bank in the Netherlands, was caught by surprise
when a leaked report from its works council claimed the bank needed to
shed 5,000 staff in the next three years.

The bank had said earlier in the year that it planned to shed only
2,100 workers in three years or 2,800 workers over four years.

STAFF SUGGESTIONS at Midland Bank saved the company #250,000 ($400,000)
in one year, it was revealed after the bank's suggestion scheme won
praise from the UK's Industrial Society.

THE SPANISH insurer AGF-Union y el Fenix said it needed to shed 35
percent of its workforce as part of its recovery plan.

The company was faced with a great deal of staff duplication following
the merger of AGF Seguros and Union y el Fenix in June.

DECEMBER

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank became the first UK bank to open its branches
on a Sunday.

Twenty three NatWest branches, each offering a full counter service,
opened on the two Sundays before Christmas - a move which took the
bank's nearest rivals Barclays, Midland and Lloyds by surprise.

Though the move was described as "a trial", the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union claimed it was a prelude to seven-day opening throughout
the year.

TRADE UNIONS took one of the world's most profitable banks to court
last month claiming their new code of conduct infringed civil
liberties.

Banco Popular Espanol, Spain's biggest bank, was taken to court by the
Commissiones Obreras and the Union General de Trabajadores.

The code prohibits staff from living outside the town or village where
they work; no bank employee should act as a guarantor for a loan; and
no close family member of an employee should set up a business
enterprise. The code also states that"the bank does not encourage
friendship between managerial staff and the bank's clients or between
bank staff themselves".

DEUTSCHE BANK said it planned to freeze personnel costs in its domestic
banking business in 1995 - but its vice-president and head of personnel
Christoph Woehrmann told HRBI that he wondered if the target was
achievable.

Woehrmann said the bank planned to shed less-qualified clerks,
particularly in payment transactions and branch operations, by using
improved technology.

THE FOURTH-largest bank in the US, Chemical Bank, said it was shedding
3,700 employees, or 9 percent of its workforce. The move was aimed at
raising its return on equity from 14 percent to 16 percent.

DON'T FIRE ALL YOUR BRANCH STAFF YET

Conventional wisdom has it that the branch network's days are numbered,
that the future lies in ATMs and direct banking. Not so, says David
Rhodes, a believer in reconfiguration, rather than eliminatation

REPORTS OF the death of the branch are very much exaggerated. But, like
anything else, bank branches need to be evolved, to be reconfigured and
used in an effective way.

If you believe some commentators, traditional networks will be swept
away by the combinations of telecommunications and technology which
will create the virtual bank. Specialist competitors, such as mutual
fund companies, will pick over the bones that are left and customers
will desert those few remaining branches in droves.

But let me take you back in time and across Europe to East Germany. The
Berlin Wall has just come down. Imagine a bank in the town of Leipzig -
let us call it "Bank A" - with $4 billion of assets, 1,300 employees
and 67 branches. Some 400,000 customers, all in Leipzig, give the bank
a 67 percent market share.

Well, when the wall came down the bank found that life would never be
the same. Big, successful, modern banks such as Deutsche and Dresdner
moved into Leipzig with their bright, more customer-focused branches.
So the bank conducted some research among its customers - Chart 1 shows
the results.

"Bank A" is ahead in only two areas - low fees and convenient branches.
So, what do you think happened to this bank? What do you think happened
to market share? What do you think happened to profits? What on earth
do you do to fix all this?

Needless to say, one suggestion would be to close branches. Across
Europe many bankers say branches are becoming obsolete. They argue
there are too many branches and they are being made redundant by
automatic teller machines (ATMs), the telephone, cards and video
technology.

The Big Four in the UK, for example, have closed almost a quarter of
their branches in the last ten years. Midland, the most aggressive, has
cut 30 percent of its network. Midland, incidentally, has stated
publicly that it does not intend to cut any more and here are my views
why.

Imagine your business as a healthy tree. However healthy it is, it
cannot survive continual cutting of its branches. Banks are no
different. If you cut branches you lose customers and balances, you
lose a critical recruitment tool, you actually only achieve limited
cost savings. You lose cross-selling opportunities and so you lose
contribution and suffer reduced profitability. Let us look at why these
statements are true.

Chart 2 shows that more and more customers are shared with competitors.
In a world with fewer exclusive customers and more competition, you
need to think very carefully before you take away a critical
recruitment and service delivery point. In the UK, 75 percent of
customers have relationships with more than one institution, and while
a typical bank has 80 percent of the loans held by its customers, it
only achieves 20 percent share of their mortgages and 30 percent share
of their deposits.

At the moment, in the UK at least, branches are still heavily visited.
Fifty percent of customers visit their branch more than two to three
times a month. Only 10 percent never visit their branch.

But why do customers like to visit their branches? One reason is that
they are not always as eager to embrace technology as we would like
them to be.

Recent UK research found that 40 percent of customers preferred to
withdraw cash in person. This is only partly to do with age, another
reason is mistrust of machines. In Britain, there have been well
publicised cases of phantom withdrawals. This is a behavioural and
attitudinal issue that cuts across all socio-economic and demographic
segments. The mistrust of machines is even higher when it comes to
depositing cash and cheques. Finally, over 80 percent of respondents
prefered face to face financial advice, largely because advice is about
relationship and trust.

The research also showed that some customers prefer remote technology
solutions for some transactions. Any branch banking strategy needs to
reflect the fact that large numbers of customers prefer the telephone
or ATMs for some of those transactions. There is also the classic
dilemma of people not knowing that they want something until of course
you give it to them. But I do think that it is important to remember
that personal contact is central to all banking relationships.

There is another reason why branch closures may not be an attractive
option. Location is the number one reason why people choose a bank. In
the UK nearly 90 percent of people bank within ten minutes of where
they live or work.

Recruiting customers is of little value unless you sell attractive
higher margin products to them. We talk a lot about databases, customer
information files, marketing central information files, and so on. Some
people are enjoying success with these tools but none of them have
dispensed with the branch.

The most crucial aspect of selling is getting branch staff motivated
and trained. To take the example of one of the best European banks in
selling life insurance and pensions, 80 percent of the leads came from
staff talking to customers, only 20 percent came from targeted
marketing using the databases.

If we dissect those leads generated by the branch, 70 percent of the
customers had originally come into the branch just to conduct a
transaction, only 2 percent had come to inquire about life and
pensions. One other point, the conversion rate of leads to sales was
higher for the warm branch-based leads than the cold database-generated
leads.

Let us look at what happens if you do choose to close branches. First
of all, direct cost. In one large European bank less than 5 percent of
branches failed to cover their direct costs. The question is: how many
do you need to close before you can make significant reductions in
central or shared costs?

But calculating the business impact of closing branches is very
difficult. We found that many customers will not move two kilometres to
another one of their existing bank's branches, if a competitor has a
closer branch. We found that within two years of closure a bank is
doing well to have retained two-thirds of the customers from a closed
branch. The only exception, of course, is the merging of two branches
which are virtually adjacent.

Many customers use branch closure as an excuse to move. It crystallises
dissatisfaction and it seems that many of the most attractive customers
defect. Many customers are very traditional in their bank habits, have
large numbers of competitive branches nearby, and resent the upheaval.
Indeed, our analysis shows that closing 20 percent of branches saves
just 2 percent of network costs (Chart 4). That is not enough to solve
anyone's problems.

Yet, we need to recognise that changing channel dynamics will leave
behind any under-used network. As volumes switch from the branch it
seems probable that branch transaction costs will rise by about 15 to
20 percent over the next few years.

The development of the debit card, smart cards, new electronic point of
sale technology, increased ATM functionality, will all reduce the
volume of cheque and cash transactions at the counter - but only by
around 25 percent over the next few years. Equally, the telephone and
ultimately multi-media technology will allow simple sales, inquiries
and transactions such as bill-paying to be removed from the branch.

Of course, consumers will accept technology more and more as they get
used to things like armchair shopping and the greater convenience and
efficiency technology might bring.

But, again, this does not suit everybody. Research has shown that
financial services came around 50th in a list of uses for the
information superhighway. This is partly because the superhighway
cannot be used for physical transactions and partly because consumers
do not want their financial records in what they see as the public
domain.

The solution is reconfiguration - reconfiguration to cut cost, to build
sales and relationship management capability.

A Consumers Association survey of UK retail banking found a very large
gap between customers' expectations of bank staff efficiency and
service and what customers actually get. There is enormous room to
build better customer satisfaction and I want to emphasise the
importance of the branch in delivering service. If we are to justify
keeping branches then we need to provide the level of service that our
customers demand.

Quality is best achieved by fixing the processes by which you deliver
customer service. If you cannot do this, your branches will not achieve
the cross-selling and recruitment potential that justifies them. This
requires setting explicit ambitious customer service targets and
keeping to them.

One bank conducted customer research and concluded, for example, that
counter wait times should be restricted to less than two minutes in the
branch. When they achieved this the staff saw a man looking lost in the
bank lobby. "What's the matter?" they asked. "I'm worried," he said.
"Is this bank in trouble? There always used to be long lines of people
and now there are none. What's happened to all your customers?"

Another one of the bank's standards was based on new accounts. Account
opening was to take place at a sales desk, not at a teller's counter.
An ATM card and cheque book were to be offered immediately, specific
additional personal information was to be obtained and the customer was
to be given an introduction to some of the bank's other services. The
bank then measured its performance in achieving these things.

This very simple example illustrates a number of things: service
criteria were set in relation to customer needs; the account opening
process was designed to provide a relationship framework, collect
information for future marketing purposes, and to lay the seeds in the
customer's mind of what the bank could offer; and to do this through
personal, rather than through written communication. That is an example
of a bank trying to maximise the benefit of a face-to-face branch
interaction.

The next step in boosting service in an existing branch network is a
complete rethink of the role of the branch.

Someone said to me recently that the relationship between a bank and
its customers was built on trust and that selling products would
destroy that relationship. I have to say that individual must have
little faith either in the products his bank sells, or the staff who
sell them.

If, like me, you believe that branches are your sales outlets, you will
definitely need to recognise the emerging roles of your staff in a
sales-focused branch. The job today - and in the future - is for branch
staff to identify customer needs, to solve customer problems, to lead
the marketing and sales effort. Rather than being accountable for
balancing the books and making sure the cash transactions are done
efficiently.

In the future, branch staff are really going to be accountable for
customer satisfaction and sales. And that means they will need very
different skills from the skills they have today. They will need
greater communication skills dealing with customers -negotiation skills
in a way - and, of course, greater product knowledge. All this implies
that staff must be better trained.

Now, if you achieve this you will be doing a lot better than my next
example: a sort of lost potential used to justify the closure of
branches. It is to do with the cross-sale of mutual funds. In this
bank, 1,350 target customers for mutual funds came into a branch in any
given month. Of those 1,350 customers only 50 were recognised by the
bank staff as potential mutual funds investors; only 15 were approached
to see if they were interested, and only three actually made an
appointment with a sales person.

This was partly because the tellers lacked the confidence and the sales
skills to approach people; they were offered a $100 incentive, yet it
just did not work. Essentially, 99 percent of the market potential was
missed by the branch staff. Changing that would have changed the
branch's economics.

Another role that the tellers can play in reducing branch costs is by
helping customers to use ATMs. If a customer tries to cash a cheque
over the counter, it can be turned into a relationship opportunity
because the teller takes the customer to the ATM and shows them how it
works ie the customer feels that the teller is delivering valuable
assistance. If the teller has the right information in front of them,
they could use the opportunity to look at the customer's account
history and maybe spot an opportunity to suggest certain credit or
investment products. If tellers do not talk to customers, they cannot
create this sort of opportunity. And the opportunity certainly cannot
be created, if the tellers have no branch to work in.

So, what will the branch of the future look like? Well, much of the
back office will have been stripped out of the branch along with the
staff who felt happier doing the administration. Re-engineering will
have streamlined the customer processes at the front end and
centralised the factory processes at the other end into lower cost,
high scale, highly automated and highly efficient processes.

One day, the only processing a branch will do is a little point of sale
inputting before sending all the paperwork to a regional or a national
processing centre. The counter staff will move from an administrative
role to a relationship management and sales role. This will allow
branches to employ fewer, but more flexible staff. This also means that
in future branches will be smaller.

On the left of chart 5 is a picture of the standard format of a UK
bank. In the past, most of the branch space was given over to
administrative activities behind the glass screen. Customers were
crammed into the small area at the front.

On the right of the chart, we see the small branch of the future with a
much more open customer and merchandising area. The administrative
area, once nearly half the branch, is less than a quarter. There is
more automation for the customer, and for the staff, whose paperwork is
nearly eliminated. There is much less space so the branch's running
costs are much lower. This means a bank's physical presence on the high
street can be maintained while cutting costs. With less space needed,
the bank can afford better locations. Supporting these branches will be
a number of remote branded ATMs.

Is fixing the branch network really worthwhile? Well, you may have
wondered what happened to our bank in Leipzig. I am pleased to say that
it still exists. It re-engineered its branch processes and redesigned
its branches. It introduced a relationship and sales culture. It added
ATMs and it introduced a telephone banking service for existing
customers which, incidentally, won a pan-Germany marketing prize. It
kept almost all of its branches.

Two years later the customer survey was repeated and, as chart 6
shows,"Bank A" is now doing better than its competitors in many areas.

Cover Story:  Room Service


TURN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF 51ST ST.  AND SEVENTH AVENUE in New York and
you're at the doorstep of the Michelangelo.  No hawking awnings herald its
presence, only two discreet brass plaques:  one, with its name, the other,
identifying it as a Summit International hotel.

Down the avenue at 48th St., an antique clock atop Victorian lettering
introduces the Renaissance amid a visual onslaught of the Times Square
neighborhood neon.  Like the Michelangelo, its entrance is conspicuously
simple.

Welcome to "hospitality heaven," anchored at 45th and Broadway to the south by
the Marriott Marquis in the heart of the theater district, and to the north by
the New York Hilton at 53rd St.  and the Avenue of the Americas, extending
east and west for another half-dozen blocks.  This stretch of rooms with and
without views runs the gamut from glitzy to sedate, with clientele from
tourist to first class.  The names on the marquees are familiar:  Holiday Inn,
Sheraton, DoubleTree, Embassy Suites.

Beyond the guest room doors, the bars and restaurants and shops, however, a
highly competitive business battle is being waged to win the hearts and minds
of upscale business and leisure travelers.  It involves a savvy blend of
marketing and financial strategies that boil down to a common denominator:
service.

But service comes in many forms.  Both Renaissance Hotels International and
Utell International are service and management companies.  Neither owns the
hotels that are their clients.  For the Renaissance group, equity stakes in
some of these clients will broaden the income base.  Utell's client base has
grown from the vast network of travel and reservation agents and Utell member
hotels around the globe that use its reservations and booking systems, to
hotels that carry the Summit International brand, like the Michelangelo, and
are part of Utell's sales and marketing network.  Whether it's reservations or
financial services for travel agents, state-of-the-art technology is the glue
that holds it all together.

Each company has set out to create a niche in a highly competitive environment
that is rebounding from the rampant hotel expansion in the last decade that
sapped profitability.  Now, with an improving global economic climate, a
resumption of leisure travel, and an explosion of business travel, these
competitors are charting strategic courses to guide their businesses into the
next century.  And the name of the game is branding.

When Renaissance Hotel Group N.V.  launched an initial public offering in
September on the New York Stock Exchange at $17 per share, branding was a key
factor.  The IPO is aimed at reaping a return on the investment of its parent,
New World Development Co.  Ltd., a publicly traded Hong Kong company, while
concentrating on what Renaissance does best:  hotel management.  Renaissance
calls itself the only "pure" hotel brand management company in the field:  no
contracting services for laundry and restaurants, no casinos, no
entertainment.  The restructuring brings together its three international
brands-Renaissance, New World, and Ramada-and converts the 28 Stouffer hotels,
acquired in 1993, to the Renaissance brand.

Utell, whose hotel reservations system is considered by travel industry
professionals as the industry standard, has evolved into an integrated sales
and marketing business in the past 25 years.  In 1991, Utell created Summit
International, while it continues to serve travel agents and hotel owners
around the world.  Since its founding in 1930 by travel writer Henry Utell,
the company has passed through three owners and now is part of Reed Elsevier,
the Anglo-Dutch travel and publishing giant.

While their approaches differ, both companies have some common strategies.
They rely on regional management and organization, with local management from
the operating country.  Service is the driver, and enhancements are aimed at
the business traveler and conference organizer seeking first-class
accommodations.

Renaissance has 109 hotels under management around the world, as well as
Ramada Inns in the U.S.  under a master franchise agreement.  The company has
equity stakes in some of the properties under management.  It operates an
integrated reservations system, and is one of five hotel companies
participating in American Express' Membership Miles program.  Renaissance has
its own incentive services, too.  Club Express is a frequent stay guest
program with an email address, Meeting Express is aimed at conference
coordinators, and the RSVP Club rewards people who book guest rooms for other
individuals.  Reaching out to the business traveler, the Stouffer Renaissance
Chicago Hotel a year ago was the first U.S.  hotel to offer a 24-hour retail
Kinko's on-site business center.

Utell represents 6,500 hotels in 164 countries, with 44 sales and reservations
offices.  It is connected to the Global Distribution System (GDS) through
450,000 airline reservation systems terminals worldwide.  Through central
offices in Omaha, Neb., London, and Singapore, it runs a sales and telephone
reservation network that circles the globe.  Among the cornucopia of
technological services afforded to reservation and travel agents is
UtellVision, which offers guided tours via computer terminal of
Utell-represented hotels.  Utell's global reservation service, and sales and
marketing activities, are available to its Summit International hotel members.

"This business is all about sales, marketing, and image," Michael Ball says of
Utell's focus, and its strategy of launching the five-star Summit
International brand.  "Hotel owners still want to build up their hotels.  They
don't want to give up their identity and exclusivity."

Ball wears many hats.  At Utell, he is the worldwide sales and marketing
director, with executive responsibility for the development and implementation
of strategy.  At Summit International, he is the managing director, where his
watch also includes Insignia Resorts.  And in several months, he will add
another topper when the company launches a third brand.

One would not be off course to include the Utell "brand" with those of the
company's branded hotels when the talk turns to strategy.  Utell does not own
hotels.  Indeed, the Michelangelo's owner is Star Hotel Group, an Italian
chain that was seeking a different feel and look for its New York property.
Enter Utell, which handles the chain's reservations system; now, through
Summit International, it provides the marketing savvy.  Sitting in the lobby
lounge of the Michelangelo, Ball points to the hotel's midtown Manhattan
"neighbors" as an example of Utell's role in the business.  "Owners are
competing with all these other brand names within a 10-square block.  They're
saying, 'We need marketing to compete.' Branding in America is everything;
it's not as strong in Europe."

For Renaissance, which posted first-quarter fiscal 1996 net income of $7.8
million on revenues of $29.1 million, building the brand meant consolidating
businesses that joined the New World Development family through a series of
acquisitions:  Ramada, Stouffers, Penta, New World Hotels International.  By
bringing the United States based business under one name, Renaissance aims to
bring added value to the parent and pull in its own return on investment.
Today, Renaissance manages 53 hotels in the Americas, 49 in Europe, and 35 in
the Asia/Pacific region; 94 management contracts have remaining terms of more
than 5 years.  Licensing the Ramada name in the U.S.  contributes close to $20
million per year in cash flow.  The company has 27 new hotels under
construction or development worldwide.

Robert Olesen, chief financial officer and the strategist behind the IPO,
notes that the Renaissance hotels represent $30 million of balance-sheet
equity and $500 million in market equity that were buried in the parent
corporation.  Now New World Development owns 55% of Renaissance, 34% is
publicly traded, and the balance is held by private investors who had owned
50% of New World Hotels International, the Asia/Pacific-based brand that is
part of the revamped company.

Public Access

"For us to sit on their books as a $30 million asset, it's very difficult for
the shareholders of that company to see the value of what's buried in that
very large conglomerate," he says.  New World Development has extensive real
estate interests in Hong Kong and China, and is the largest foreign holder of
land use rights in China.  New World Infrastructure, another unit that went
public at the same time Renaissance was listed, is a partner in developing a
toll road in south China, and is participating in construction of a power
plant.

"Shareholders can't value conglomerates," Olesen observes, citing the
difficulty of assessing values to assets that have different growth prospects,
different patterns for business.  "Now it's easier for the investor to give
proper value to it."  The IPO is a value enhancement for the company.  "When
word got out in Hong Kong, it got attention.  The value of New World
Development stock went up and continued to rise despite the Hang Seng Index
going down.  I think the shareholders in Hong Kong appreciate the values being
recognized."

To maximize value, Olesen adopted a two-step plan:  a tax strategy and a
branding strategy.  The tax strategy involved restructuring the assets
geographically.  "We made a fundamental change in the way we do business," he
explains, "restructuring what was a U.S.  company to where we took the assets
outside the U.S.-the real estate, and management/franchise agreements-and
broke them out from under the U.S.  umbrella.  They're free from U.S.
taxation and are taxed locally.  Then we created a Netherlands company to be
the umbrella.  All our U.S.  assets are in a series of U.S.  companies."

From a management standpoint, this reorganization shook up priorities.  Now,
the first is as hotel managers, and second as managers of real estate.  "It
takes some getting used to.  As a manager, is my goal revenues or
profitability?  And how do I serve the hotel owner?  We view the cash we
generate in a totally different manner than we did four months ago.  We don't
look at that cash as available to invest into new beds, new wallpaper.  It is
to be invested into new hotel projects.  Now we look at hotels, after paying
expenses and fees, as what is the cash flow needed to improve an operation."

New World Development, the Renaissance group's owner, now has hotel capital
expenditures on its balance sheet.  Most of the hotels under Renaissance
management are owned by New World.  Olesen's oversight extends to both the
hotel company and the real estate company.  But Renaissance Hotels is not in
the real estate business, he states.  It is not an owner, but a management
provider.  "Hotel ownership has different investment objectives, lower current
earnings requirements because of the perception of long-term value," he says.
"Management is a fee-based, current earnings business.  It's
profitability-oriented.  In most instances, management agreements give a
percentage share.  Long term, the real estate company is very limited in what
it can do.  Local financing drives the business.  With the management company,
there's not as great a need to go international."

To meet earnings objectives, Olesen is targeting 10% per year growth in the
number of hotels under management.  In the next five years, that translates to
175 hotels.  He expects franchises will hold steady near the current level of
30.  "More would require the acquisition or takeover of another hotel
management company, some outfit with 20 under management," he says.

By focusing on management, Renaissance produces "free cash" that can be
committed to new projects.  "We can buy into equity ownership of the hotel;
that sets us apart from the competition," he says.  A net holding of slightly
less than 20% can be accounted as an investment on the books.  A 20% stake is
worth $5 million.  Currently, five projects are open and operating; five are
under construction.  Olesen would like to add 5 or 10 projects per year with
equity ownership.

Diversification is not part of the plan.  "I'm a strong proponent of focused
business, focused management," Olesen says.  "There are opportunities enough
in the hotel management business that we don't need to get into ancillary
businesses."  He cites consolidation of the hotel industry, and the
consolidation of brands.  "We don't have to focus entirely on internal growth.
There are rebranding opportunities out there all the time."

No Reservations

At Utell, diversification of services is its stock in trade.  Fifteen years
ago, Utell shook up the reservations industry when it broke with tradition on
two fronts.  "Until then, the norm was to represent a few hotels in one
market," Michael Ball recalls.  "To break this approach, we opened offices
worldwide, about one a month until we got to 44.  Also by tradition, hotel
marketing companies don't work with competing products.  We said, 'No.' And we
went from 600 hotels to 6,000.  Most people said it can't work:  'Join Utell,
you join a supermarket.' Those two strategic thrusts kept us busy until the
'80s."

The strategies worked because Utell incorporated a third element:  technology.
In the '80s, PanAm developed Panamac, a joint reservation system for airlines
and hotels.  "We were the first company to recognize the effect technology
would have," he says of Utell's participation in Panamac.  Today, Utell's
reservation system, called UNISON, connects to all of the major GDSs.

"I remember sitting in a room talking about this.  Our view was the business
was going to go to a variable cost business from a fixed cost business," Ball
says.  "Utell became the leading technology agency.  Ask the man in the
street, he doesn't know who Utell is.  Ask a travel agent, he'll say the best
in technology."

Utell's three customers are the hotel, the travel agent, and the traveler.
Half of its marketing is directed at hotels, the other half, at travel agents.
"We're a reservation service.  The market decides where the guest stays.  Our
job is matching expectations."

Expectations within the Utell organization regarding its next strategic move
were another matter.  The 1990s brought a "What's next?"  from management.
"We were faced with the problem of having a successful company that we wanted
to grow by 20% to 25% per annum," Ball says.  "There was the danger of doing
alchemy in reverse:  taking 6,500 hotels and 44 offices and converting that to
a small, traditional reservations company."

Just as dramatically as Utell's numbers had zoomed, growth was capped.  "We
saw the need to build loyalty with existing partners.  So we stopped signing
up hotels and focused on restructuring to build loyalty."  Regionalization
replaced the British-oriented company based in London.  The three head offices
were established, and corporate staff was slashed to a half-dozen from several
hundred.  In addition to London, Omaha, and Singapore, a Mexico office looks
after Latin America, and sales and marketing are based in Secaucus, N.J.
"Thinking global, acting local" became a mantra.  In Europe, Utell has a
policy that all employees must speak three or four languages.  And employees
regularly are transferred to different countries.

To make a success out of its new game plan, Utell capitalized on a company
staple:  cutting-edge technology.  Ball credits this commitment, and the
creation of the Summit International brand, as pivotal in Utell's strategic
success.  As a service provider, technology is becoming Utell's most
marketable product.  Ball draws fine distinctions when describing the roles of
Utell and Summit International in the lodging industry universe, but
ultimately there is a synergistic interplay.  The Summit client, by his
description, does not need the management and finance support, or the neon
sign.  It needs technology.

"Our hotels are concentrating on managing rooms.  We're spending $22 million
in 1995 and 1996 with IBM, and we're halfway through and on track and on
budget," Ball says.  The new system is a response to the enormous changes in
reservation lead times, which have shrunk from 21 days to 6, and the enormous
matrix of rates and terms.  "The new system allows access to the Internet.
We're building a home page for Utell.  And Summit is going live on the Travel
Web in January," he says.  These services will benefit the traditional Utell
client and the independent Summit hotel.

Summit International's 71 hotels include 25 added in 1995.  Ball expects a 20%
increase in 1996.  The corporate target is 250 properties in 80 cities.  "The
biggest challenge to our business is to introduce the segmentation," Ball
says, citing the distinction between the Summit brand and the 45 luxury
resorts that bear the Insignia name.  "We'll double the size of the company
every four years.  We've done it the last 10 years."

Utell's challenge is making its name a household word to the traveler in the
way it is to the travel agent.  The Summit International brand, created to
appeal to independent hotels, is the key, Ball says.  And he believes the
evolution of the lodging business after overextension and retrenchment in the
past decade has created a market for the independent.

"For many years, a lot of 'reluctant owners'-the banks-were making decisions
about hotels.  We saw an enormous growth of branded hotels as a result.  Then
the banks began to realize there were alternatives to the brands.  Technology
is allowing greater competition-you've got 23,000 hotels in SABRE-and some of
the more ambitious finance houses are seeing the benefits of going the
independent route."

The influence that comes with name recognition, he believes, can be
transferred to the independent hotels without compromising their independence.
And Summit International is poised to benefit.  "I'd be horrified in a few
years time if travel agents didn't know the Utell name, and I'd be horrified
in a few years if the traveler didn't know the Summit name," Ball says.  "The
strategy is to play at two different levels.  Our growth?  We attribute it to
daring to be different.  We've taken the threat out of technology."

Stack Attack


Why authors think that just because they have a new angle on
strategy-psychological, self help, or sporty-that the new approach makes the
information fresh, is outta my dysfunctional ballpark.  The only way these new
takes work are with humor, self-parody (unintentional does count), or some
redeeming worth buried in the footnotes.

In most cases, the so-called sport/business books bite off much less than they
can chew and then they choke anyway.  There are only so many Heimlich
maneuvers a reader can do.  Sports as an analogy for business...Sports as
business...Business as sports...Business as an analogy for sports.  Watch out,
because this is where this marketing gimmick is going.


Branch Rickey's Little Blue Book:  Wit and Strategy from Baseball's Last Wise
Man, by Branch Rickey.  Published:  Macmillan, New York.

Author's Credentials:  Rickey teams won eight pennants and three World Series
championships between 1926 and 1949.  The book was edited by John J.
Monteleone from 131 cartons of Rickey "stuff" in the Library of Congress.

Thesis:  Resist any tampering of the status quo if you already are
successfully manipulating it.

Scope:  1880s to 1980s.

File Under:  Manager as coach.

Reason to Buy/Read Longer than a collection of quips, shorter than a
collection of essays, it's more absorbing than the typical boys-of-summer
fling.  Features L.B.  Mayeresque Rickeyisms like "An addition by subtraction"
and interesting excerpts from Rickey's scouting reports (which he called
"Prospects & Suspects").

Placement in Your Life:  On the bedside table in the guest room if you suspect
that your weekend guest has designs on becoming a regular visitor.

How to Read:  Read the shaded boxes (the scouting reports) first as you skip
around.  Thread your way through the locker room lectures (junk) and try to
find Rickey's letters and relatively analytical comments on things from the
High School Rule (one of the status quo items he successfully manipulated) to
the farm team system (which he pioneered).

Irresistable Miscellanea:  Before signing Jackie Robinson in 1947, Rickey
spent several years scouting Puerto Rico, Panama, Cuba, Mexico, and the
Caribbean "only to find that the great Negro players were right in our
country."

You will throw this book across the room if:  Cliches along the lines of "If I

Workplace:  Pass The 10q, Partner


HOW MUCH DO THEY KNOW AND HOW DO THEY KNOW IT?  These are questions likely to
be circulating more frequently in executive suites as corporate leaders take
another look at their workforces through a new lens.

The knowledge under discussion is not about work rules and labor/management
relations, benefits, and overtime pay.  This is about the bottom line-stock
performance, quarterly reports, strategic decisions, capital investment and
expenditures, the costs of doing business-and sharing.  According to a study
released last month by Ernst & Young LLP, U.S.  workers who are treated as
business "partners" are most likely to be more productive and more motivated
to contribute to their company's profitability.

Innovation, according to Timothy Ridge, national director of human resource
consulting at Ernst & Young, is at the heart of the matter.  The initiatives
needed to educate, motivate, and reward employees apply to private and public
companies, union and non-union shops, and will bridge the gap between the
board room and the shop floor, he contends.

This view has been captured by John Case, author of Open-Book Management:  The
Coming Business Revolution (Harper Business, 1995), who says that by learning
how the business they work for works, employees gain a new appreciation for
the company, feel a more direct stake in its success, and, therefore, work
harder to assure themselves the job security they desire.  With a more
knowledgeable workforce, and one that has a stake in the company through stock
options, employee ownership, profit sharing, and bonus plans, the company is,
indeed, a well-oiled machine where all are working for the common good and
"us" and "them" are relegated to the scrap heap.

It's an ambitious effort, and one that has a track record.  Magma Copper Co.
broke the mold in 1991 when it negotiated a 15-year labor agreement with its
unions that built upon the team concept of labor/management relations.  Cost
reductions have enabled Magma to modernize, launch a major U.S.  exploration
effort, and attract the Wall Street capital to invest in Latin America.  The
strategy paid off:  In mid-December, Australia's BHP made a $2.4 billion offer
for the company.

More recently, Southwest Airlines negotiated a 10-year pact with its pilots'
union that incorporates stock options in lieu of salary increases.

U.S.  Labor Secretary Robert Reich points to Xerox and Ford as two
corporations where economic literacy of the workforce has been fostered by the
establishment of labor/management partnerships.  "It's an extraordinary
revolution of the ranks of organized labor to give up work rules for this kind
of empowerment," he says.

"Employees who really understand where they fit in the company strategy
generate real value," Reich notes.  "Employees are assets to be developed,
they're not costs to be cut."  He points to the dual forces of competitiveness
and competing strategies.  "Getting costs under control is the view of many:
cut payrolls, outsource here and abroad.  But there's no sustainable
competitive advantage.  It only comes from what you do uniquely.  Competitive
strength is a product of teamwork.  There's no way we can sustain recovery and
the economy if workers don't have enough pay in their pockets, if their hearts
and minds aren't engaged."

Knowledge Is Power

The Ernst & Young study, conducted December 4-8, was designed to see if a gulf
exists between employees and management.  The results offer an eccentric mix
of responses to 15 key areas.  Ernst & Young interviewed 146 executives (CEOs,
CFOs, senior vice presidents, vice presidents, directors of human resources)
and 251 "rank and file employees" (including managers, customer service
representatives, administrative assistants) at Fortune 1000 companies.

Employees proved to be very well informed on financial issues concerning their
companies, but surprisingly ill informed about the operations side.
Management turned out to be well plugged into the workforce.  Especially
telling was the one question that did not involve communication, but an issue
that cuts close to the bone:  job security.  Only 35% of the employees are
confident management will make sure they keep their jobs.  When the question
was put to senior management, only 26% believed strongly that employees are
confident in them on this issue.  Both groups expect layoffs in the next 12
months:  27% of management, 28% of workers.

But this study was about information issues, and the responses show some
interesting workplace trends.  Both groups think the company keeps employees
well informed about finances and business performance (senior management, 51%,
workers, 53%).  A whopping 70% of the rank and file know stock price trends in
the past quarter, and both groups believe this knowledge is broad based (63%,
54%, respectively).

But only 15% of workers know the cost to manufacture one of its company's
products or the cost of its services.  Most employees (43%) do not think their
co-workers know these costs, while even fewer executives (39%) think workers
are informed.

Workers indicated a need for specific information that relates to their jobs.
Company communications methods, however, are geared to a broader, general
audience:  Newsletters (91%, 84%) and meetings (82%, 73%) command the lion's
share.  Videotapes (43%, 40%) and video conferencing (25%, 28%), both well
suited to a large audience and easy to customize to meet specific needs, were
at the bottom of the list.

Both groups believe employees would be more motivated if they knew how their
work contributed to company profits (77%, 59%).  And most executives (54%) and
workers (53%) think the company helps employees develop new skills to boost
job performance.

Less confidence was expressed by workers asked if management helps them
develop new skills to earn promotions:  44% agree strongly, 8% disagree
strongly.  Contrast this with 42% of management in the affirmative and 1% in
disagreement.

Ernst & Young found the relationship between performance and contribution to
profitability illustrates a desire by workers to change their roles and assume
more decision-making responsibility to benefit the corporate balance sheet.
Management's response was more optimistic (77%) than workers' (59%), however,
when asked if employees will be more motivated if they know how the work they
do helps the company make money.  The second largest worker response group
27%, agreed somewhat to the notion.

Teams represent the dominant culture (80% for both groups), and both agree
teams make their company more competitive (83%, 78%).  Technology improvements
are credited with enabling employees to increase productivity (63%, 60%).

Battling Economic Illiteracy

Open-book management, and the partnering approach, mean management gives up to
get.  John P.  Stack, president and chief executive officer of Springfield
Remanufacturing Corp.  (SRC) in Springfield, Mo., agrees.  Stack says the key
to the strategy in his company was to create a paradigm:  Wipe out the
economic illiteracy problem among employees.  "It was a way to raise capital
and create jobs," he recalls.  "We had to tell them the success of the company
is derived by the success of the balance sheet."

SRC remanufactures engines and engine components; originally, it was the
remanufacturing plant of International Harvester.  Stack was the plant manager
in 1983 when IH, trying to stave off bankruptcy, was selling off assets.  He
and 12 other managers and supervisors bought the debt-burdened plant and
created SRC as an ESOP.  Hourly workers hold 34% of the stock.

Despite the debt, Stack was able to increase the workforce five-fold, lift
productivity and, with it, the stock price.  Annual sales last year are
estimated at $103 million versus $16 million in 1983.  Growth has been at a
rate of 12% to 15% per year, and debt to sales has shrunk dramatically.  "If
you put $100 in the company in 1983, it's worth $2,700 today," Stack says of
the employee-owners' investment.

At AES Corp., the Arlington, Va.-based global electric power company with $2
billion in assets and revenues exceeding $5 billion, Dennis Bakke's view of
corporate culture takes a page from New Age thinking.  "We need to make the
workplace an efficient place without squelching workforce creativity as the
Industrial Revolution did," AES' co-founder, president, and chief executive
officer, maintains.  "We need a paradigm shift.  We need to eliminate
management, the people who train, strategize, make decisions, the things I
learned at Harvard Business School.  Then we also have to eliminate labor,
people who want to be taken care of."

Radical?  Maybe.  But it works for him.  Bakke's view is guided by a culture
that sees business as more than a money-making venture.  He cites a quartet of
"shared" values:  to act with integrity, to be fair, to have fun, and to be
socially responsible.  Bakke argues that 99% of businesses across the board
"still operate on the assumption we're all interchangeable parts."  To counter
this, create a fun workplace, where using one's skills builds loyalty and
dedication and workers enjoy themselves in the process, he urges.

"It starts with radical power sharing, really giving up power," he says,
explaining the unstructured style at AES.  "We don't have any set
authorization limits, no central budgeting.  We don't send information to
people, we try to generate it.  Information sharing is not sending people
information.  There's no central staff operations, except for accounting.  And
if I could decentralize accounting, and I think I have the software to do it,
I will."

Information is free and flowing.  AES employees don't have to wait for
quarterly earnings reports.  Monthly financials are published in the corporate
newsletter, making all employees "insiders."

Partnering

At the end of the day, opening the information loop stands as the critical
element, and workers as business partners the device to redesign the culture.

"Partners get real information, not what management decides they need to
know," Case maintains.  "In business, real information lies in financials, the
balance sheet, sales reports, what's needed to make decisions.  Partners take
responsibility for the business, the exact opposite of the 'hired hand'
mentality.  When you're a partner, making money is everybody's job."

Jim McCann, president and chief executive officer of 1-800-FLOWERS, cites the
"15 minutes of fame" his company has been able to stretch in the past two
years when it's been "white hot," and the challenge of sustaining current high
growth levels for another three years.  "To make that happen, I have to build
a winning culture," he says.  "My real job is to be a cultural engineer."

A former social worker, McCann built his $250 million company in 10 years.
Today, it is the world's largest florist:  2,000 shops, 150 of them company
owned.  Customer service is at the heart of his business, and he uses it as a
tool to empower his workforce-a function of the cultural engineer.  Creating
an upbeat work environment, giving recognition to a people-oriented workforce,
these are fundamental to his strategy.  Customer service, in effect, becomes
an information channel.

His management style incorporates a kind of retro, back-to-basics approach.
"I was the product of the post-war period.  If you were a shopkeeper doing
really well, you couldn't show it.  You had to be discreet.  That's changed
dramatically in 20 years' time," McCann observes.

In the business marketplace, people want to go to work and work hard, and have
an environment that is compelling.  Creating that environment is McCann's job.
Innovation is the key.  He points to Ben & Jerry's for ice cream, Swatch for
watches, WalMart for retail as shining examples of this approach.  The culture
factor opens a window on why businesses struggle, he adds, pointing to Kmart's
financial woes:  "The difference with Kmart and WalMart, I think, is that Sam
crafted a culture."  That culture carries an openness unheard of in highly
competitive fields like retailing, a strategy McCann emulates.

"You must teach what ownership is all about," Stack says.  "The objective is
to match people with opportunities.  Something magic happens when people begin
to understand (how business works)."  SRC's employee-owners, with their
initial $100 investments 12 years ago, are a perfect case in point.  "The
people who started with our company have $60,000-in Springfield, Mo., that's a
house.  The trouble is, now they want a boat, and all the other things.  But
change shows they can get it."


Going Global:  Exploring The "Intranet"

Networks command a lot of IT management's time, in part because of their
strategic importance and in part because they are complicated and built on
fast-changing technologies.  But there are emerging alternatives to
do-it-yourself networking, starting with the Internet.  About two-thirds of
the companies in a recent Dataquest survey say the Internet is a key part of
their IT strategy.  Of particular interest is the "Intranet"-the corporate use
of the Internet for email and collaborative, groupware-like applications.
"Some companies are relying very heavily on the Internet for internal
communications and abandoning their own efforts to create parallel networks,"
Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management, observes.

In the area of more robust, international networks, some vendors are starting
to offer global telecommunications services.  Their target customers:
multinationals that traditionally purchased network services on a
country-by-country basis from various local carriers, usually state-owned PTT
monopolies.  The new breed of global service provider intends to do away with
that hassle by offering "one-stop shopping," allowing multinationals to get a
wide range of voice and data network services in all the countries where they
have a presence from a single source.

The advent of global service is the result of political and financial efforts,
rather than technological breakthroughs.  More and more countries have been
deregulating their telecommunications markets, making it possible for a vendor
to offer cross-border, end-to-end service.  But creating a global capability
takes a tremendous amount of capital and technical expertise, a burden that no
provider wants to shoulder alone.  As a result, vendors have been aggressively
forming partnerships, joint ventures, and alliances.

"Each of the major country PTTs and telecom companies are linking up madly in
a series of marriages to be able to provide a global infrastructure," John
Scholes, president of Regent Associates International, in East Hartland,
Conn., says.  These ventures include World Partners, a product of AT&T,
Singapore Telekom, and several other PTTs; Concert, formed by British Telecom,
and MCI; and Phoenix, formed by Sprint, France Telecom, and Deutsche Telekom.
The opportunity for these companies is clear.  For example, after just a year
and a half in the market, Concert offers services across dozens of countries
and has signed up more than $700 million worth of customers.

Despite such rapid advances, true one-stop shopping for global telcom services
is not quite here yet, observers say.  "Pieces of it are in place," Scholes
says.  The remaining portions should come together quickly as deregulation
comes to more markets-including most of Europe's, which are scheduled to be
open in 1998.  As regulatory barriers fall, prices will come down and global
reach will increase.  "There will be more choice," Scholes notes.  "Companies
will be able to buy from a number of partnerships, choosing those that can
offer them the most services worldwide."  -P.H.


Alcoa Builds A Superhighway

At Alcoa, the maxim "Think globally, act locally" is not just a slogan.  It's
a blueprint for the company's organizational structure.

"We do not have a single business.  We have a whole array of businesses, with
very different customers and very different customer behavior," Keith
Turnbull, vice president of strategic analysis/planning and information, says.

Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, posted record
1995 revenues of $12.5 billion.  The company's businesses are in sectors as
diverse as aerospace, transportation, and construction.  Its 169 operations
sites span 26 countries and run the gamut from bauxite mining in Australia to
the manufacture of auto parts in Brazil, building products in Belgium, and
bottle caps in Japan.

So when Alcoa announced in November a $150 million joint venture with
Microsoft and Hewlett Packard to build its own information superhighway to
connect more than 15,000 computers in the Alcoa system, Wall Street pricked up
its ears.

"Better and faster access to information is the lifeblood of Alcoa's strategy
for maintaining product quality, serving worldwide markets, and building
partnerships with our customers," Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said at the
time.  Alcoa's corporate strategy has kept the company a Wall Street favorite,
even in tough economic times.  The joint venture, called the Common
Infrastructure Initiative (CII), gives Alcoa the ability to leverage
technology as it leverages its industry position in international
manufacturing joint ventures.  And it takes Alcoa to the next step in the
corporate evolution begun five years ago.

In 1991, to get closer to its broad customer base, Alcoa reorganized a
centralized corporate structure into 22 business units, each with the freedom
to align its processes and products with its customers.  Among other things,
that means those units are free to pick their own information systems.

Initially, these systems were effective in supporting local operations, but at
the enterprise level, they had to be strung together so information could be
moved throughout the corporation.  For example, Alcoa found itself with eight
different email systems.  "We have to put them together, we interface them and
translate them," Turnbull explains, all of which impedes information flow and
adds to the complexity and cost.

Last autumn, Alcoa began rebuilding its systems using the same hardware and
operating system software around the globe.  "The decision was that we would
craft a common infrastructure that would cross over all the business units and
provide a capability for the aggressive and convenient sharing of
information," Turnbull says.  And CII was born.

When completed in mid-1997, CII will deploy 10,000 Microsoft Windows NT
workstations running Microsoft Office and 450 servers running components of
Microsoft BackOffice.  There will be a single, integrated email system.
Hewlett Packard is providing project management through the implementation
phase, hardware configuration and delivery, and ongoing support that includes
a help desk.  In the first phase, now underway, 250 of the servers will be
installed, 4,000 desktop computers will be replaced or upgraded, and the help
desk will be open at some 150 U.S.-based businesses.

This uniformity will make it easier to manage the systems centrally and
distribute software upgrades over the network.  At the same time, it will
leave Alcoa's business units with the local processing power and flexibility
they need to work with specific customers in specific markets.  "This is a
common infrastructure that we can play across," Turnbull explains.  "But we do
not impose a way to run the business."

He likens the CII to building a road.  "The people who design the highway
don't decide who will use it, or how many trucks there will be on it.  But
they do decide what the lane width will be, what the curvatures will be, so
each trucker can make independent decisions about how to travel.  It's just
common enough to make it useful, and just free enough to make it
entrepreneurial and adaptive."

When the project is complete, employees in one part of the company will share
a wider range of information with employees in virtually every other part,
accelerating overall responsiveness and decision making.  "The speed with
which we can deploy questions, draw back the data, clock the responses, and
feed it back for worldwide interaction-you just can't match it," Turnbull
says.  "With commonalities of technology, your ability to bounce that back and
forth is really fast and pretty painless."

The simplified sharing of information will make it easier for business units
to tap into the wealth of knowledge located throughout Alcoa.  While customers
vary, production technologies often are similar.  Business units can learn a
lot from each other by directly sharing breakthroughs and transferring new
technologies and techniques.  "It's very useful to be able to trade best
practices from one location to another," Turnbull observes.  "Ideally, that
trading should not have to climb up some hierarchy and come back down again."

Finally, a common infrastructure helps management keep its eye on more
competitive issues.  If one of Alcoa's automotive units is developing a new
process, "they don't have to decide what kind of desktop hardware or server to
use-and those aren't really going to determine whether your business succeeds
or fails," Turnbull says.  "The infrastructure decisions are already crafted
and deployed, so they get to skip that and concentrate on what it takes to
make a better car.  The efficiencies come from being able to spend more of
your time dealing with the business issues, and less of your time dealing with
infrastructure issues."  -P.H.

Teambuilding:  Whoa, team!

Everybody's cheering on corporate teams, but they're not infallible.  From:The
Paradox Principles, by The Price Waterhouse Change Integration Team.
Published by Irwin Professional Publishing, Chicago.

Teams are pervasive.  According to a recent survey, 68 percent of Fortune
1,000 companies were using self-managed work teams in one form or another in
1994.  But not everyone sees teams as effective.  Here are some common
problems:

1.  Teams assigned to inappropriate tasks.  The greatest error of all is to
form a team as a knee-jerk reaction to a problem that an individual ought to
tackle.  Teams too often reflect a manager's reluctance to take action or to
empower someone to "get it done."  Teams are not appropriate for all tasks.
2.  Inadequate commitment to a clear performance objective.  The single most
important determinant of team performance is that each member understand
clearly the team's performance goal and that each be fully committed and
mutually accountable for its achievement.  This is seldom the case.  Many
teams are simply patchworks of people who would like to achieve an objective
but who have no unifying obsession to get it done.  An important corollary
here is that team goals should be explicitly connected to significant
issues-and this connection must be ratified by senior management.  3.
Inadequate (and inappropriate) training.  By and large, team training is a
mess.  People come into teams with diverse experience, technical abilities,
and-most important-social skills.  Seldom is the training crisply focused on
what this team needs to know.  Training is abundant but often unfocused and
unproductive.  When we asked one interviewee what he had learned from a series
of sessions on self-directed work teams, he responded, "I learned that you
need an agenda for meetings"-and in so many words, he added, "and not much
else."  4.  Unrealistic management expectations.  When management sees teams
as a way to transform the organization beyond the teams' specific goals, the
use of teams is likely to disappoint.  There is little evidence that teams
have changed whole cultures or radically altered employee attitudes toward the
organization.  Most teams are groups.  We've been working in groups for
decades amidst cultures strong and weak.  5.  Indecisiveness.  Teams are
rarely as decisive as the individuals who make up the team.  How can they be
when they're struggling to gain consensus, make everybody happy, and craft a
compromise solution?  Teams should produce better ideas.  But those ideas will
be of little use if they arrive too late.

Technology Watch:  Net results

From the keynote address to Comdex/Fall 1995 by Louis V.  Gerstner, Jr.,
chairman and chief executive officer of IBM Corp.

If you look at microprocessors, memory, software, storage, you'll see that the
laggard of the technology family has been communications technology.  PCs and
servers have become enormously powerful, but they communicate through the
equivalent of soda straws.  All that is changing.  Very powerful networking
technologies-principally ATM-will be the next phase of computing what the
microprocessor was to the current phase.  I think the most profound
implication of this new technology is that it will change the nature of
computing itself.

If the communications link between the PC and the network is cheap enough,
fast enough, and has virtually unlimited bandwidth, why not migrate a lot of
the functions that currently reside inside the PC to the network-the
applications, the data, the storage, and even some of the processing?  This is
not a throwback to the mainframe era.  End users will still have the
user-friendly features they value in PCs.  They'll click on applications, and
response time will be just as good, if not better.  And because we won't have
to stuff this new device with lots of technology, it can be much less
expensive to purchase, maintain, and upgrade...

When will network-centric computing arrive?  Well, it's already arriving-just
look at the Internet, the most powerful and important of all networks.
People, organizations, and networks are connecting at a rate no one expected,
and that pace will continue, if not accelerate.

I think we'll see network transactions-electronic commerce-take hold very
quickly.  The final step-pushing the applications, operating system, storage,
and processing up into the network-will take longer.

A lot of people are looking for network-centric computing to pay off in the
consumer space first...but we are seeing it take off first in businesses....
That's because while I've talked a lot about technology driving us toward
network-centric computing, technology is only an enabler of a much more
powerful force:  a whole new way that...companies, have conceptualized their
strategic priorities.  They've discovered a powerful new form of leverage:
the leverage of organizational knowledge as a means to compete more
effectively and to differentiate themselves in the marketplace...

The most important, most valuable, most sought-after content in the world
belongs to corporations and large institutions.  It's created and collected
every minute, around the world:  intellectual property, designs, market
intelligence, supply and demand, customer trends.

The problem is, this knowledge is spread across incompatible computer systems.
It's distributed across PCs in various departments, it's locked up in desks
and filing cabinets, and, yes,some of it is locked in the heads of employees.
Powerful networks can unlock this knowledge and move it to the people who can
use it effectively.  This drives shorter cycle times and allows teams of
people to become more productive and creative.

Computer Analysis:  Shrink rap

If you believe your employees or your customers won't respond to "cold,"
computerized response systems, you may adjust your thinking after reading this
from Reengineering Human Resources, by Lyle M.  Spencer, Jr.  Published by
John Wiley & Sons, New York.

Eliza is a computer program developed by MIT computer science professor Joseph
Weizenbaum in the 1960s to test artificial intelligence ideas about
human-computer interactions.  This program essentially acts as a nondirective
Rogerian psychotherapist.  Rogerian therapists reflect:  they repeat whatever
their clients say in a caring, questioning "tell me more" tone.

When you load Eliza, the screen displays a welcoming message:  "Hi!  I'm
pleased you want to talk with me.  What would you like to talk about?"  If you
type "I'm angry at my girlfriend/ boyfriend," the computer, using
psycholinguistic analysis, identifies the feeling word "angry" and object
(boy*/girl*) in your sentence and asks you:  "Why are you angry with him/her?
Tell me more."  The program continues a slightly stilted but plausible
conversation, politely prompting you to explore your thoughts and feelings for
as long as you want to play with it.

To Weizenbaum's astonishment, the finding regarding computer empathy was that
MIT students and other adults who used Eliza actually preferred the computer
shrink to human psychotherapists.  Clients found the computer more caring,
more accurately empathic, and more responsive.  And, of course, Eliza was
always available, 24 hours a day, with complete privacy, on students' own
terminals, free, or at least immensely cheaper than a $100-an-hour,
hard-to-get-an-appointment-with human therapist.

Marketing:  Can I see your ID?

From Building Strong Brands, by David A Aaker.  Published by The Free Press,
New York.

In Japan, corporate brand-building efforts often are aimed primarily toward
current and prospective employees.  An impact on customers is seen as almost a
bonus, and certainly not as the only benefit.  Japanese firms consider it
vital that employees feel pride in their firm because of its values, purpose,
past success, and future goals.  They believe that workers who feel this pride
will then be more effective and motivated and will buy into the group
activities and culture that are at the heart of the Japanese management style.
Corporate advertising in Japan is thus largely justified on the basis of its
internal impact.  In contrast, employees in the United States and Europe are
rarely considered to be an important audience for the corporate advertising
effort.

Stimulating Strategic and Organizational Change In Japan, firms often engage
in corporate identity (CI) programs, the goal of which is to obtain consensus
among a broad cross-section of employees as to what the corporate identity
should be.  The process not only results in a corporate identity for which
there is "buy-in" among employees but it also provides a vehicle to stimulate
change and renewal within the organization.  For example, in 1985 a broad set
of groups within Asahi Breweries discussed the identity and vision of the
firm.  The result was a new attitude that made Asahi Dry and other programs
feasible.  One tangible sign of the new Asahi was a decision to change the
firm's rising-sun logo, which was more than a century old.


Management:  Language lesson

For managers, powering their own speech patterns may be as important as
empowering their staff.  From The Art of Framing, by Gail T.  Fairhurst and
Robert A.  Saar.  Published by Jossey-Bass, San Francisco.

Linguistic anthropologist William O'Barr and his colleagues have identified
several "powerless" speech forms:

Hedges:  language that reduces the force of an assertion by allowing for
exceptions or by avoiding commitments, such as "sort of," "a little," and
"kind of"

Intensifiers:  language that increases or emphasizes the force of an
assertion, such as "very," "definitely," "very definitely," and "surely"

Hesitations:  "meaningless" expressions, such as "oh well," "let's see," "so,
you see," "uh," "um," and "you know"

Questioning forms:  use of rising question intonation a the end of what would
otherwise normally be declarative sentences, such as "I weigh 125?"  or
"Definitely we could do that?"

Intangible Assets:  Designer labeling

From Why Firms Succeed, by John Kay.  Published by Oxford University Press,
New York.

Reputation is the most important commercial mechanism for conveying
information to consumers.  But reputation is not equally important in all
markets because customers find out about product characteristics and product
quality in many ways.  Sometimes they learn from searching.  Other attributes
become apparent as soon as a product is used.  The importance of reputation
can be seen in those markets-from car rental to accounting-to which product
quality is important but can be identified only through long-term experience.
In these markets, reputations are difficult and costly to create but, once
established, can yield substantial added value.

Empowerment:  If it's not one thing, it's another

Is "power to the employees" your new corporate mantra?  It may not be enough.
From Focused Quality, by Harvey K.  Brelin, Kimberly S.  Davenport, Lyell P.
Jennings, and Paul F.  Murphy.  Published by John Wiley & Sons, New York.

When visiting a major hotel chain's property, the enthusiasm of the staff was
obvious.  A front desk clerk wore a large button that said "I'm empowered."
When asked what that meant, she said, "I can do anything to keep a customer
happy so long as I don't give away the property."  She was asked how and
replied, "If something goes wrong, I can give you one of these green tickets
for a free drink or meal and if needed even a room."  However, when asked
whether she ever looked at the processes to avoid having to compensate for
mistakes, she answered with a worried look, "What's a process?"

The Last Word


Intelligence-artificial or otherwise-bombards us from all directions.  It's
not surprising that Steve Martin, playing a cutting-edge neurosurgeon in "The
Man With Two Brains," saw a major business opportunity.  Entire rooms, floors,
even buildings are dedicated to the kinds of technological advances Dr.
Hfuhruhurr couldn't begin to imagine...and that's not counting the "flesh and
blood" thinkers.

So we asked some experts about intelligence, and gave them carte blanche to
pick their descriptive niche.

"Intelligence is understanding what you don't know, and where to find the
answer."

-Donald Dinan, international trade attorney and partner, O'Connor & Hannon


"Intelligence can be knowing where we're not going.  Sometimes an aggressively
executed non-strategy is as good as a strategy."

-Thornton May, vice president, Cambridge Technology Partners


"Intelligence is the product from the gathering of secret information for a
variety of possible purposes, including to support policymakers, in response
to military needs, or to offer conference negotiators an advantage of advance
notice of adversary intentions."

-David Whipple, executive director, Association of Former Intelligence
Officers and 35-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency


"Intelligence is a person's ability to assimilate abstract or complex concepts
and present them in understandable terms."

-Douglas C.  Yearley, chairman, Phelps Dodge Corp.


"Intelligence is information that's been analyzed to the point where a
decision can be made.  Anything less is just a lot of information.  And we
have too much of that already."

-Leonard Fuld, president, Fuld & Co.

Short Takes


Blanket Coverage

Boyd, Brown & Co.  has come up with a new way to manage your risk if your
business is international trade.  Risk-Transfer, the trademarked financial
product it developed in partnership with Chubb Insurance as the underwriter,
protects the financing of purchase orders for import, export, and domestic
trade transactions by covering them with proprietary specification compliance
insurance.

This insurance provides the collateral required by lenders, guaranteeing loans
will be repaid either from the transaction proceeds or by the insurance firm.
The cost is approximately 2% of the transaction value.  This compares to 3% to
4% typically charged by government or other private insurers.  Commercial
banks, no strangers to economic and political risk, normally require customers
to post collateral for 100% of the trade finance funds advanced.

Boyd, Brown, based in Chicago, is an international trade banking firm
specializing in purchase order financing.  Worth Brown, president and
co-founder, says Risk-Transfer was created "to move the financial risk of
trade from the risk-averse lenders to the risk-accepting insurance carriers."

Protection is extended to issues of quality and late deliveries by overseas
manufacturers, too.  Shipments are tracked to confirm the transaction has been
completed.  Worldwide on-site inspections are conducted for specification
compliance; logistics management services monitor the progress of
transactions.  And, as an extra feature, Risk-Transfer ensures the parties
responsible for transportation, customs clearance, and delivery "are competent
and adequately insured."

Boyd, Brown thinks Risk-Transfer can help solve the industry-wide problem of
"trade dispute" that arises from quality and finance issues.  These are plain
vanilla problems-wrong size, wrong color, who pays?-but can turn a simple
business transaction into the deal from hell because conventional credit
insurance or export guarantys usually exclude coverage when "trade disputes"
occur.

"There are heated battles all the time," a Boyd, Brown spokesman says.  "With
Risk-Transfer, there aren't any questions.  The insurance company pays."

Start Me Up

So you're thinking of opening a branch office in Chile.  The political climate
is warm, the economic climate the best in Latin America.  You know Chile is
the only country in the region with investment grade bonds, more copper than
anywhere else in the world, good skiing, and some mighty fine wines.  But
where do you set up shop?  What about real estate?

Nacore International has rolled out the welcome mat with its 1996 edition of
its International Starter Kit series, or everything you ever wanted to know
about the business climate-specific to real estate-and culture of foreign
countries.  No fear here.  The trade group's 3,300 members manage real estate
for non-real-estate companies.

The choices are many:  Argentina, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary, India,
the Philippines, Russia, and Vietnam are part of the new edition, joining
Chile, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal,
Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Each Starter Kit includes economic indicators and benchmark comparisons;
benchmarking data for major market rents worldwide; office and leasing
guidelines; expanded travel tips and cultural and business guidelines; and
tips and contact information written by Nacore members doing business in each
country, an instant networking tool.

Members are entitled to three free kits; after that, each kit costs $20.
Nonmembers pay $25.

The kits are the brainchild of Mark Hoewing, Nacore's executive director.  The
research is by Nacore and Colliers International.  Each kit contains a
"culturegram" from Brigham Young University that describes the particular
country, from its climate to its politics.

Is This the Party to Whom I Am Speaking?

Voice mail and poor diction mangle names and numbers ruthlessly.  As
communicators, we've turned into a nation of spellers.  It used to be only
those of us with complex or eccentric surnames (and I speak for legions)
learned the drill from our parents of patiently spelling it out, complete with
little clues like "F as in Frank" for the difficult-to-differentiate letters.

Are businesses immune from these linguistic gymnastics?  Au contraire.  And
thanks to mergers, acquisitions, buyouts, and creative consultants, the name
you hear at the other end of the phone line may have nothing to do with the
party you thought you were calling.

Last year, 1,154 companies took new names, representing 13.9% of the more than
8,300 companies surveyed by Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a corporate
identity management consulting firm based in New York, for its 26th annual
tally of corporate name changes.  The survey tracks companies listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market,
as well as major private corporations and U.S.  subsidiaries of foreign
companies.

The 1995 results show an increase of 4% from 1,114 changes in 1994.  But that
pace trails the 1,285 changes recorded in 1992, the highest since 1991.

"Corporate managers are realizing that a name change should reflect the new
way the company views itself, or the metamorphosis it has undergone," Jim
Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Anspach Grossman Portugal,
says.  "Like the products a company names or the services it provides, a
company's name and identity have to be sold to the public."

So much for "household words."

Corporate image, interestingly enough, jumped 16% from 1994's 179 changes.  By
and large, though, the new "noms de biz" are born out of a variety of reasons:

* n Mergers/acquisitions:  602, or 53% * New corporate image:  307, or 27% *
NYSE or Amex listings:  78, or 7% * Nasdaq listing:  123, or 11% * Financial
sector:  288, or 25% * Manufacturing/industrial:  172, or 15% *
Communications:  182, or 16% * Health care:  139, or 12%

New York led the geographic list with 139 changes, followed by California
(98), Texas (69), Pennsylvania (56), and Ohio (52).

Mergers and acquisitions resulted in a mixed bag of monikers.  Kidder, Peabody
& Co.  disappeared from the landscape when acquired by the re-dubbed Paine
Webber Group, Inc.  And Lockheed Martin Corp.  came into being when aerospace
giants Lockheed and Martin Marietta merged.

While market research may select a name that better conveys a new corporate
focus, consumers may be in for a reality check.  Take Greyhound Financial, now
doing business as Finova Capital.  Or imagine if you're a customer of
Rochester Telephone, returning from a year's sabbatical in Zambia.  Well, say
hello to Frontier Corp.

Mind the Gap

So you've been posted to London.  You have a flat, a travel card, an adapter
for your appliances.  Your friends in Des Moines are filled with envy.  What
they don't know is that your wages and benefits are below those of your new
colleagues in the same office.

Terence Boudreaux, senior marketing executive for Cigna International's group
and employee benefits division, doesn't buy it.  In his view, expatriate and
third-country national (TCN) employees should be paid under the same plan.

"U.S.  expats and TCNs are often paid on different scales-and they know it,
because they often work side by side," Boudreaux says.  "If their benefits
also differ, it can lead to dissatisfaction-usually among TCNs-and,
ultimately, the loss of talented people who figure prominently in the
company's success."

Furthermore, this plan should be distinct from the parent company's U.S.
plan.  Benefit costs average 10% to 20% higher in the U.S.  than other parts
of the world, he notes, making it more cost-effective to the company to cover
these groups under a "carve-out plan" that takes into consideration the
special needs of foreign-based employees.  And the plan should be portable.

"The plan you create for these groups should be structured to follow them
around the world," Boudreaux says.  "A new assignment shouldn't mean a loss of
benefits or require that the employee meet new preexisting condition
limitations or deductibles."

And he urges companies to demand service at least equivalent to U.S.
standards, basics like having one contact point from any location, direct
claim processing, 24-hour access to claim personnel, and specialized services
like language translation and currency conversion.

"Employees don't want to have to pay a $15 or $30 currency conversion charge
when they try to deposit a $50 reimbursement at the local bank," he observes.


Born to Run?

The eternal leadership debate-born or bred-keeps consultants in business and
business schools in vogue.  As companies restructure and business sectors
reinvent themselves, however, more responsibility, power, and leadership
demands are shifting to people without the formal training and, more
frequently, the natural talent.

Development Dimensions International, the Pittsburgh-based leadership training
experts, developed a quiz that reduces leadership issues to its simplest
terms.  To develop the questions, DDI surveyed close to 1,500 people-from
executives to business associates-from 25 organizations in the United States
and Canada:  13 manufacturing companies with an average 500 to 1,000
employees, and 12 service firms with an average 1,000 to 5,000 employees.

1.  Sharing rationale and personal feelings about decisions with employees is
a sign of weak leadership

True ___ False ___

2.  As a leader, I need to step in and take charge if an employee's project
runs into major problems.

True ___ False ___

3.  Delegating just causes employee resentment, plus it takes less time to do
the work myself.

True ___ False ___

4.  When two of my employees are having a conflict, it's best for me to step
in and resolve the problem quickly.

True ___ False ___

5.  In this era of downsizing and restructuring, it is critical for me to keep
open and honest communication with my staff.

True ___ False ___

6.  Leaders should take every opportunity to tell employees what they are
doing wrong.  This will increase productivity and ensure goals are met.

True ___ False ___

7.  It is important for a leader to act as a catalyst-to inspire or motivate
employees as they work on projects.

True ___ False ___

8.  The best way to build employee confidence is to supervise projects
closely.

True ___ False ___

9.  The most important characteristic of a leader is:

A) Ability to motivate employees and inspire commitment

B) Remaining consistent

C) Willingness to promote teams

D) Enhancing employee's visibility

E) Control the way work is done

SCORING:  For questions 1 through 8, score 5 points for each correct answer;
for question 9:  score 5 pts.  for B, 3 pts.  for A or C, 1 pt.  for D;
subtract 5 pts.  for E.

A score of 41-45 indicates you're an accomplished leader; 31-40, your skills
are inconsistent-analyze your strengths and work on your weaknesses.  If you
scored 0-30, better get to work...and read this magazine!

ANSWERS:

1.  False.  Disclosing your own feelings, thoughts, and rationale about a
situation in a balanced way will instill loyalty, motivation, and enthusiasm
in employees.  2.  False.  Taking over when things go wrong, while tempting,
sends the wrong message to everyone.  A leader's role is to provide support
without removing responsibility and coach people to find their own solutions.
3.  False.  Delegation is an important leadership tool.  The challenge is to
consistently match the right person or work group to the assignment and then
provide support.  Delegation maximizes involvement, productivity, motivation,
and growth for the individual and team.  4.  False.  Taking charge, or even
ignoring conflict, is not the best approach because you remove responsibility
for solving problems from the employee.  As a leader your best choices are to
listen and mediate or provide support as the parties work through the source
of conflict.  5.  True.  Fear is the most common reaction to change.  The best
way to allay fears is for leaders to regularly communicate full, accurate
information so employees understand their role in change and what's ahead for
them and the organization.  6.  False.  Feedback should be used primarily as a
tool for growth.  Always giving people negative feedback is de-motivating.
Feedback should be balanced, specific, and oriented toward learning.  7.
True.  Today's most effective leaders place an emphasis on sharing
responsibility, coaching, providing resources, helping people through change,
and forming partnerships.  A catalyst maximizes and stimulates the talents and
skills of others.  8.  False.  With greater spans of control, leaders simply
don't have time to look over someone's shoulder.  Leaders need to help
employees develop self-leadership behaviors.  By helping others to think
through problems, ideas, and opportunities, leaders create an environment in
which high performers do their best work.  9.  B.  Being consistent ranked the
highest in a survey of most desirable qualities for leaders.

Taking Stock Of the January Effect


By Mike Braude


Stock market investment strategies have one ultimate goal-to buy low and sell
high.  If only it were that easy.  The multitude of options available to
investment strategists and portfolio managers today, coupled with the myriad
of vehicles in which to pursue them, often leaves many perplexed.  Some
business people have a clear advantage-they can sense where the market is
headed.  Many cannot-at least not until now.

Twenty years ago, researchers identified an investment opportunity during the
year-end holiday season that has since been dubbed the January Effect.  The
name refers to the tendency of small stocks to outperform larger, blue-chip
issues at the end of one year and into January of the following year.

Since 1975, analysts have spent a great deal of time studying the January
Effect's various degrees of activity.  While market research doesn't suggest
that the financial markets will trend upward each January, it does indicate
that small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks at that time,
whether the general market trend is up or down.

Although this phenomenon has occurred nine out of every ten years since 1926,
it went unnoticed for a long time because it is not apparent from following
the performance of large stocks, such as those that comprise the S&P 500 and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  In fact, if you look at the S&P 500 for the
period from 1926 through 1985, you'll find no evidence of the January Effect.
However, if you compare the performance of the S&P to a broader stock index
that includes a number of smaller stocks, such as the Value Line Arithmetic
Index, the Effect is clearly evident a majority of the time.

The January Effect is not limited to U.S.  stocks.  Numerous countries around
the globe have experienced significantly higher stock market returns in
January.  In Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy, the average stock market
return in January has been greater than the average return for the whole year.
In fact, it is the only month of the year with a positive return for every
country.  In 65% of the countries where stock is traded publicly, January
contributes more than 50% of the total return for the year, excluding
dividends.

Why January?

There are investment-driven explanations for the timing of this trend.
Investors tend to sell losing stocks in December for tax purposes.  The
selling pressure forces stock prices below their equilibrium value, and when
the pressure is suddenly released in January, prices spring upward.  Another
theory holds that secondary stocks come under pressure at the end of the year
from window dressing-a tendency by portfolio managers to "clean out" the
stocks of smaller, lesser known companies from portfolios for reporting
purposes.  Stocks are then repurchased after the reporting period ends.  Still
others subscribe to the notion that renewed interest in buying stocks occurs
after the holidays, when investors search for stocks they consider to be
underpriced.

Whatever the reason, the fact remains that during the January Effect period,
small-cap stocks can achieve returns 10 to 12 times higher than those of
large-cap stocks.  The stocks most likely to achieve these gains are those of
companies valued at less than $200 million; issues that underperformed the
previous year; stocks with high betas (the measurement of stock responsiveness
to the broad market) considered especially volatile; stocks with low
price/earnings ratios; and stocks paying no dividends.

Certainly, small company stocks tend to outperform other stocks in general
because their risk is higher and investors expect to be rewarded for this
increased risk.  But the reward they receive in January tends to be far higher
than in any other month.  According to finance professors Robert Haugen of the
University of California and Dr.  Josef Lakonishok of the University of
Illinois, nearly all the risk premium for investing in small firms is earned
in January.

Futures Key to January Effect Trading

Investment strategists, portfolio managers, and others can take advantage of
the January Effect in a number of ways with varying levels of financial
commitment:  taking positions in individual stocks, trading options on
individual stocks, or trading stock index futures or options on the futures.

Of these alternatives, market analysts often suggest stock index futures and
options on the futures for trading the Effect.  Taking positions in individual
stocks, or options on stocks, does not necessarily ensure a broad
representation of the stock market.  In addition to being subject to broader
market phenomena like the January Effect, stock performance is vulnerable to a
range of factors from earnings reports to labor/management problems.

Stock index futures and options, like many other financial index products,
have the benefit of providing the broader market representation while
requiring only one transaction for investment.  Market analysts often
recommend KCBT Value Line futures and options for trading the effect.  The
Value Line Arithmetic Index, on which Value Line futures are based, is
comprised of some 1,650 stocks.  Each stock is equally weighted, so that a
stock trading at $150 per share has the same weight as one trading at $20.  A
3% minimum fluctuation in the price of a stock with 2 million shares
outstanding has the same weight as a 3% change in a stock with 10,000 shares
outstanding.  As a result, the Value Line is viewed as a good indicator of the
secondary, or small-cap, market.

To capture the January Effect, the Value Line can be spread against stock
index futures representative of blue-chip stocks, such as the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's S&P 500 Index, a capitalization-weighted index that
measures the performance of 500 of the largest, mostly blue-chip, companies;
the CME's Major Market Index for monitoring a broad section of 20 blue-chip,
heavily capitalized stocks; and The New York Futures Exchange's New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index for measuring the performance of the 2,500 stocks
traded on the NYSE.

Recent studies indicate trading the January Effect is more profitable with
small-cap value stocks than small-cap growth stocks.  A growth stock would be
a stock that has a market value significantly higher than its book value,
while a value stock would be a stock that has a market value below its book
value.

New York Stock Exchange small stocks tend to be primarily value stocks.
Nearly 75% of the 1,650 stocks included in the Value Line index are NYSE
stocks.  For this reason, the Value Line index is a logical index for one side
of a January Effect spread.  It also is the only index with two futures
contracts:  the Value Line and the Mini Value Line.  The latter is one-fifth
the size of the larger contract, allowing for greater flexibility.  In
addition to being a vehicle for trading the January Effect, the Value Line
also is an excellent tool for portfolio and pension fund managers to hedge
their stock market risk.

Trading the January Effect

One easy way to trade the January Effect is with a futures spread.  Selling
one blue-chip stock index futures contract (taking a short position) and
buying one small-cap stock index futures contract (taking a long position)
enables investors to capitalize on the relative performance between the
secondary and blue-chip markets.

To initiate a spread, you could buy a Value Line futures contract and sell an
S&P 500 or an NYSE Composite Index futures contract to capture the blue-chip
section of the market.  Hypothetical performance results compiled by the Moore
Research Center based in Eugene, Ore., reveal that Value Line/S&P 500 and
Value Line/NYSE Composite futures spreads produced positive results every year
the contract has traded.

If both indexes go up, the Value Line leg of the spread would make a profit,
while the S&P/NYSE leg would incur a loss.  However, the Value Line profits
would be expected to be larger than the S&P/NYSE losses, making for an overall
profitable trade.

Trading the January Effect through futures spreads is more affordable than
taking actual positions in each equity, because spreads tend to be less
volatile and therefore have more favorable margin treatments.  Transaction
costs could eat away most, if not all, of the potential gains derived from
January Effect trades conducted with the corresponding basket of securities,
and the market impact would be far greater.  Stock index futures allow
investment through one simple transaction for a small percentage of the
brokerage cost of a similar investment in actual stocks.

Options strategies also can be incorporated.  For example, if you are
concerned a declining market could erode the performance of the small-company
side of your small-cap/blue-chip spread, you could protect your small-cap
component by buying Mini Value Line put options.  By buying a deep
out-of-the-money put, whose strike price is lower than the current market
value, you can lower your option premium and, at the same time, help to insure
against extreme losses on the small-cap leg of your spread.  Like the Mini
Value Line futures contract, Mini options have a value of $100 times each
index point, compared with a value of $500 times each index point for Value
Line futures.

Timing the January Effect

As with any commodities spread, timing is an important aspect of participating
in the January Effect.  Research shows the optimum results occur when
positions are initiated in December and liquidated in January, although some
investors may try to put on positions earlier and hold them later.  Professor
William Ziemba of the University of British Columbia and commodities trader
Ross Clark looked at the Value Line/S&P 500 spread from 1976 to 1986.  Their
study, which included making actual futures trades between 1983 and 1987,
found the best time to initiate the spread-buy one Value Line contract and
sell one S&P 500 contract-was on Dec.  15, with a suggested closing out on
Jan.  15.  The four years of actual futures spreads yielded a mean return of
3.47 index points.

In another study, Ziemba and Bruno Vander Cruyssen of Bankers Trust
International Plc, London, updated the futures market performance information
in the earlier study using data from 1983 to 1993.  They found the average
gains in these 10 years of futures spreads was 4.72 points, while the average
gain for cash spreads between 1976 and 1982 (prior to the introduction of
Value Line futures) was 2.23 points.  This second study points out how the
Effect seems to defy the standard market theory that when investment trends
become more widely known, market efficiency means they will no longer work.
Of all the years Ziemba and Vander Cruyssen studied, the 1992-1993 January
Effect was the most pronounced, and the Value Line/S&P spread continued to
narrow through the end of January as small-cap stocks continued their
outperformance of blue-chips.

According to Moore Research, 1994 was another great year for the
small-cap/large-cap index spread, whether the S&P 500 or the NYSE Composite
was used as a large-cap component.  Interestingly enough, the Value Line/NYSE
Composite spread performed substantially better.  For the 12 years studied,
the average theoretical profit has been $1,000 more for the Value Line/NYSE
Composite trade than for the Value Line/S&P 500 trade.

What About November?

Another seasonal trend similar to the January Effect occurs earlier in the
autumn.  Dubbed by some market watchers as the November Effect, it is less
consistent, with a narrower window of opportunity.  Academic research is
minimal.

Moore Research found the optimum time-frame strategy:  initiate a buy Value
Line/sell S&P 500 spread on Nov.  2 and exit the spread about Nov.  11 using
December futures contracts.  Another way is to use the NYSE Composite Index as
the blue-chip component of the spread, using December contracts, initiating it
on Oct.  27 and exiting Nov.  12.  Moore's hypothetical trading results showed
both spreads were profitable 11 of the past 13 years.  Moore Research found
that once this limited effect ends, the broad market tends to dip in mid- to
late November.

New Year Effect

Does the January Effect have a future?  History suggests it does.  But keep in
mind that a number of factors can influence it in any given year.  Take the
recent bullish stock market.  Some observers say the type of stocks leading
the rally can make an impact on the January Effect.  If blue chips are leading
the rally during the January Effect period, the Effect could be subdued.  On
the other hand, if a rally in blue-chip stocks slows at the turn of the year,
bulls may switch to small-cap stocks, enhancing the Effect.

Currency markets may play a role in the January Effect's performance.  A
strong U.S.  dollar tends to enhance the Effect.  A decline in the dollar can
lessen it because of the presumed positive foreign exchange impact for some of
the large, multinational blue-chip companies.

Whatever the market situation, it is important to recember that history is no
guarantee of future market performance.  And as more people attempt to
participate in the January Effect, the opportunity for profit could be reduced
or eliminated.

The 1996 Business Strategist's Software Directory


THE STEAMROLLER OF TECHNOLOGY MOVES ON.  OKAY.  SO the 1950s predictions of
robots walking the streets have failed to materialize (so far, anyway).
Still, revolutionary software is transforming strategic planning in ways that
even Jules Verne wouldn't have imagined.

In this directory, we've chronicled a few of the latest software wonders that
are recasting business analysis.  We assembled this year's list after
discussions with a number of business professionals and analysts working in
industries from software engineering to food service.  We present software
that improves management productivity and offers tools for superior decision
making-all packages to support strategic analysis with the goal of improving
the bottom line.

While it's no longer news, the 1993 introduction of Intel's Pentium and
Motorola's PowerPC chips opened the gate for desktop PCs to tackle problems
that had been the exclusive domain of pricey UNIX-based workstations.  The
combination of sheer computer power (Pentium and PowerPC), advanced market
analysis tools (idea-building tools, statistical and mapping analysis
software), and global connectivity (through the Internet) are changing the
rules of international business.  Even small, locally owned companies are
experiencing national and offshore competition.  Profit margins are eroding
across industries and markets.  To meet the challenge, players must employ
cutting-edge technology to penetrate and succeed in the worldwide arena.

To address the internationalization of strategic analysis, in this year's
roundup more emphasis is placed on geographic-analysis products than last
year.  Why?  Because more and more strategic marketing questions are best
identified and analyzed on a map rather than in the form of a 40-column by
40-row spreadsheet.  Products such as the hot, new (and pricey) ProphetPoint
from Equifax might have produced in years past a 200-page analysis with rows
of numbers and cross-referencing.  Of course, it would have been nearly
impossible to interpret.  The same data represented geographically is concise
and easy to understand.  While many organizational issues don't lend
themselves to geographic analysis, almost any market, customer, or sales
question does.

In this opening section of the Directory, we've left out the obvious.  While
all of these tools are testaments to the computer's fast-growing role in
businesses of all sizes, from Mom and Pop store to the marketing department of
every Fortune 500 company, there's no write-up on IBM's newly procured Lotus
1-2-3, and we didn't include the standards such as the heavy-weight statistics
package, SPSS.  Since strategists and marketing professionals already use many
of these products, there's no point in going into detail.  However, we have
created a listing section, which follows this one, that updates Business
Strategy's 1995 software directory.

We recommend that you check into each product's reputation and usefulness to
your problem-solving requirements before signing the purchase order.  Some of
these products are expensive (although we think worth the money), and they may
not match your organization's requirements.

This section focuses on fresh new possibilities that may help you reap a
better bottom line.  It examines 21 tools that can help you identify,
quantify, and take advantage of the global market that looms large as we close
in on the second millennium.

Strategic Planning and Market Analysis Tools

In software, new authoring environments for the Internet are making waves for
net surfers.  Internet tools are becoming easier to use, offering features
that allow users to build Web pages quickly and with little computer
programming expertise.  In fact, word processors and page layout programs are
including basic programming for building Web sites.  In terms of analytical
software, the new Atlas Select, from long-time GIS maker Strategic Mapping,
opens the door to affordable mapping technology with a focus on strategic
market analysis.  And Equifax' hot-off-the-press ProphetPoint is a powerhouse
analytical tool that provides, within minutes, existing locations for 10
million businesses and the ability to forecast business growth not just for
next year, but for five years in the future.  Talk about a crystal ball in a
box!  Just the money saved on visits to a consulting palm reader alone
justifies the purchase price.

Editor & Publisher 1996 Market Guide:  A Wealth of Strategic Data for Just
$395

There's no shortage of companies providing demographic data, but what is
unique about the Editor & Publisher 1996 Market Guide is that for a single
price you receive an enormous amount of information to use for surveying
everything from installed gas meters to local newspapers to climate.  That's
in addition to the standard population, household, and retail business data.
(The disc even includes information on the tap water pH!).  The Market Guide
disc includes its own proprietary search engine, which also can be used to
whittle down information and export it in formats compatible with spreadsheet
and database software, and mapping programs.  Maps are included with the
product, and a paper-based version ($100) is available for further reference.

EasyStreet:  Market Maps in 30 Minutes

Yes, as seasoned reviewers of mapping technology, we'd be the first to admit
that it's not all that easy to use.  But the results are astounding-a clear
analysis of a problem so sticky that a month pouring over spreadsheets can't
disclose what a map conveys in a glance.

Now there's a new mapping program for the rest of us.  EasyStreet is a mapping
environment that presents a series of eight buttons across the top of the
screen.  Clicking on each in turn selects the cartographic data and loads the
attribute data by asking the user to point to the right file.  Finally,
minutes later, the product builds a gorgeous map.  If you've been waiting for
mapping technology to become easier to use, your time has come!  And the
guarantee is real.  If you can't produce a useful map from EasyStreet within
30 minutes, you can return the product for a refund.  Now that's a guarantee
we like.

Proximity:  Market Mapping for Direct Marketers

Of the three geographic market analysis programs described in this article,
only Proximity is designed with the requirements of direct marketing in mind.
Direct mail is one of the fastest growing promotional technologies of the past
two decades.  It's a highly competitive business with the possibility of an
expensive mailing falling flat because of any one of half a hundred factors.

Proximity provides executive-level geographic (GIS) information that helps
users define direct mail efforts and follow-up tools to test hit rates and
market penetration.  Most important, it's streamlined for speed.  Users can
ask relevant questions without getting snared by the technology or hunting
through directories for files with names like VEGASDT4.MAT.

Designed after three years of research into the needs of direct marketing
analysts, Proximity contains built-in geocoding ability that converts
addresses into points on a map.  A mailing list can be mapped along with
income, population, housing, and business locations at the street, town,
county, or state levels.  Or an area can be scouted by zip code or census
block to determine which areas to go after and which to ignore as
inappropriate.  Five-year projections also are included for a glimpse into the
future.

Problem Solving and Creative Thinking Tools

While it's true that computers can't really think, even after 40 years of
research into artificial intelligence, they can help you think.  Working with
a computer-based strategist can make it easier for you to work through the
issues in a structured and logical manner.  Your silicon partner may even
remind you of issues you forgot or considered irrelevant to the current
strategic question.  Of course, if you find the session running off the edge
of the map, you can always start over or toss the session into Window's new
recycling bin or the Mac's trash can-something you can't do as easily with
human managers, management, and board members.

4Thought:  A Unique Business Analysis Package

4Thought is one of a new generation of business analysis, modeling, and
forecasting programs.  It works with your input to help you make decisions
concerning everything from product pricing to studying the seasonal impact of
product and service commitments.  Yes, it's hard to describe such a
multi-legged beast in a couple of paragraphs.  4Thought users sit down for a
thoughtful session on a rainy afternoon and build a model of their business
using spreadsheet input.  4Thought's tools are then used to better understand
their business operation and assemble "what-if" queries for the future.

Once the underlying model is complete, barring major strategic revamps of the
company or its product line, queries can be thrown at 4Thought as needed, and
answers divined from the program's analytical capabilities.  Unlike earlier
generations of such software, 4Thought has no problem with building small
models based on limited data.  Data can be imported from Excel, Lotus 1-2-3,
most databases, and SPSS.

Product TechKnowledgy:  Strategic Planning And Portfolio Management

Product TechKnowledgy from NorthPoint is a self-assessment module/model
designed for senior managers for evaluation, planning, and quantity in-house
expertise.  It also is used to predict the critical delivery process timetable
for product delivery.  Using it, managers can build scenarios and subsequent
reports that validate the steps and time estimations for design to delivery
product cycles.  The company also offers a series of risk management programs
in their RiskTech series.  Five products evaluate everything from corporate
stability and prospects to studying tactical business relationships to
understand if a strategic (or deeper) alignment makes business sense.  This is
very unusual and unique software that has been used by everyone from Adobe
Systems to Lotus.

CRUSH:  Real-Time Market Segmentation and Analysis

From the HOT group (Hands-On Technology) comes "CRUSH-an interactive
multimedia tool that helps sales and marketing management and analysts develop
marketing strategies and action plans for crushing their competition."  (Uh,
no, we didn't write that line.  It came from their press release.)  What we
have here is a database-based tool capable of building competitive "tables"
that allow users to position themselves against the competition.  It even can
be used for the difficult task of comparing one division against another in
order to build the correct separation between them.  The product is based on
the methodology of public relations guru Regis McKenna and contains A/V clips
of his advice.  CRUSH can be customized to fit the profile requirements of
each user.

Intell.Xx:  Real-Time Summarizer and Trend Analyzer

If you've ever been hobbled by your electronic news source providing a
dizzying 200 messages cached from news groups and other sources, Intell.Xx has
a product that can thin the daily deluge dramatically.  Described as
"summarizer technology," this remarkable tool can be employed to reduce the
daily volume of email and electronically distributed news reports by reducing
the text into an outline format of key points, names, and bullets.

Clicking on an article or email message icon opens it in a
reduced-to-essentials view with the elimination of words and sentences to
reveal the important content.  A long-winded email message that might take 5
minutes to read could then be scanned for the highlights in 10 or 20 seconds.

The Marketing Planning System:  Build Your Own Strategic Plan

The Marketing Planning System includes a self-study program that combines a
five-part notebook, application checks, and actual company case studies.  It's
a computer-based application designed to help users wend their way through the
complex process of building a credible strategic marketing plan, be it for
their own company, a division within a larger organization, or as part of a
plan to be pitched to investors or the venture capital crowd.  This system
produces reports that can be shared with everyone from the investment
community to line management.  To put this unique environment to work, users
follow the software's instructions to assemble the requisite components.  The
software assumes that updating will be the normal path of plan evolution and
is structured to build updates and changes into the patchwork that makes a
quality planning document.

IntelAssist:  Transforming A PC-Based Server Into a Virtual Crystal Ball

Looking into the future is something simultaneously attractive and repellent.
While you could make a mint in the stock market or on the red and the black,
not everything in the future is comforting.  And, prescient knowledge would
make life dull.  Before going shopping, you would know what was for Sunday
dinner and if (and when) the Mets will win the pennant.

For business, fore-knowledge is everything.  What new products will be
appropriate for the year 2000?  Will a strategy succeed, barely creep along,
or completely bomb?  In which direction should the corporate helmsman steer
the organization?  What governmental regulatory changes will pop up in
response to social agendas, evolving customs, and an aging population?

The Futures Group, founded in 1971, now offers IntelAssist.  An add-on product
for Lotus Notes, IntelAssist takes users step by step through the process of
looking into the future from a strategic point of view.  Users provide
background information which IntelAssist then frames into "KITs"-key
intelligence topics.  Working with the product, KITs are refined and then
become the basis for building guesstimates of the future.  This process
reduces the questions to those central to the business activities under
consideration.  IntelAssist can also internalize external materials such as
exit polls.  The product's integration with Notes allows you to use it to
query material from colleagues, and all participants in an analysis are kept
up to date on activities and results.  Finally, conclusions are built based on
the data recorded and filtered through this corporate-intelligence product.
Printed reports then form the basis of larger strategic documents for
distribution to members of the team and senior management.

Productivity Increasing Tools and Environments

The toughest agenda in business is correctly structuring the working
environment to maximize intellectual and physical throughput while containing
time sinks of all kinds.  Here are a couple of products that build
productivity without turning you into palpable material for a Sunday comics
Dilbert episode.

PeopleSoft:  Enterprise-Wide Client/Server Software

There's no shortage of enterprise-wide "solutions" that connect users to
corporate databases and handle everything from order placement to asset
management, but what has been missing was a product accessible to
non-technical users.  While PeopleSoft requires skilled engineers to program
applications for each corporate user, the unique toolbox included with the
product builds elegant applications that come down to fill-in-the-blank
routines that won't intimidate people who can hunt and peck their way through
an entry screen.  Add-on modules include manufacturing administration
packages, product distribution control systems, financial superintendence, and
a massive database management and reporting facility.

Companies that haven't invested in Oracle or other related client/server
products should take the time to check out PeopleSoft.

KEYview:  See the Internets In a New Light!

Who hasn't downloaded that hot file from the Internet that's a must-have for a
market opportunity, the grist for the mill of an important strategic plan, or
simply important background information, only to be unable to open the file?
While both Windows and the Macintosh system software include simple
applications for translating or opening foreign files, these prove either
incompatible or choke on the size of large files.

Now there's KEYview, a Windows-based platform for open, view, convert, and
print more than 24 popular text and graphics format files.  Once open, using
the built-in conversion routines, the file can be saved in a format supported
by the user's computer and application software.  For more convenience,
KEYview has hooks into popular Internet access and email tools including
Netscape, Mosiac, and this company's EXPLORE.

NamePro:  Is Your PC A Name Dropper?

One of the most thankless corporate tasks is naming a new product, service, or
subsidiary.  Scene One:  You short-list a bunch of name ideas, and in a
meeting run them by stone-faced colleagues, who remains silent while they
weigh their responses.  Scene Two:  You employ several consulting companies to
find a name for you at $100 per hour.  They come up with ideas you already
scratched off when devising your short list.  Scene Three:  You spend a few
hours with NamePro and build a series of names that fit the company's agenda
in just an afternoon.  If the committee gives a thumbs down to your short
list, you head back to your cubicle and, in two hours, produce yet another
list, or 10 lists, or 100 lists!

That's what NamePro can do for you.  Setting up the eclectic search parameters
produces a list of names that, with some yea-and-nay sorting, quickly builds a
credible list of ideas.  Best of all, NamePro is almost a joy to work with in
comparison to hours spent over a yellow legal pad scratching out ideas and
pondering options while wiping sweat from the brow.

Location Quest:  Setting Sight On the Right Site

Site location is one of the hardest problems for strategic managers concerned
with complex issues such as trade area, local demographics, natural and
artificial physical barriers and access, and surrounding locations of arch
competitors already in place.  GIS software has become the weapon of choice
for choosing sites, but most GIS packages require the addition of multiple
sets of expensive data, and there's a learning curve associated with each.  In
fact, it's entirely possible that an undertrained strategist might make the
wrong decision using an out-of-the-box mapping product because of choosing the
wrong data or simply inept operation.  Since most GIS packages are "general
purpose" in nature, users must be very familiar with the dozens of available
functions, options, and controls.  And, a poorly constructed market map is
just as convincing as one assembled correctly.  Mapping technology is only as
good as the weakest link.

Now there's Location Quest from PHH Fantus Consulting.  It's not a mapping
package, but a product specifically designed for site location, and it comes
with a robust set of data for just this purpose.  Most important, site
selection can be set up quickly, even given the numerous variables the product
explores.  And, unlike GIS software, Location Quest poses questions that help
users build the site analysis without first spending hours setting up a
general-purpose mapping program for a site location session.  The process
produces comparison tables of labor costs, cost per square foot, and more-all
of the vital information that makes one site more attractive than another.

Once the "Q&A" session is complete, the product provides a snapshot of
potential locations with an analysis of each.  The search then can be further
refined to narrow the list of possibilities.  A separate module helps analyze
complex project requirements, such as time to completion, and one that
provides community profiles.  It's an amazing product.

Data Visualization:  San Diego Computer Center (and other sites)

Not really a product (yet) is full power, computer-based, territorial data
visualization.  Used recently to persuade wanted war criminal Radovan Karadzic
that the boundaries of the new Bosnian state were drawn to reflect geological
and not political features, these computer-generated landscapes allow users to
virtually "fly" over the countryside.  Data for such a flight is collected
from many sources and then converted into a virtual landscape that can be
explored from the air or "walked" to study the finer points of the geo-image
if data with the appropriate level of detail was collected.  Amazing.

VIASOFT:  Reengineering The Turn of the Century

COBOL-just the word bring shivers to legions of systems analysts and those
responsible for modernizing mainframe computer software built in the 1960s and
1970s.  COBOL was conceived as a "temporary" programming language for the
military back in the late 1950s, but somehow has survived into the 1990s.  At
this writing, there's ever reason to believe it will be with us until the next
millennium.

As the heart of many of today's airline reservation systems, banking
environments, and more uses than we can chronicle here, COBOL is here to stay.
At least for a while.  VIASOFT (their caps, not ours) builds software that
allows software engineers to study the coding monoliths and repair and update
them.  Everything from abends (bugs) to "dead code" can be found and
eliminated with VIASOFT's intelligent "re-engineering" products.

But now the company has a new product to fix something you see reported at
least once a year in the Sunday paper-major computer systems that can't handle
the awkward transition to the millennia they were built for five or six years'
use back in 1965.  Well, VIASOFT offers a product that can be used to bring
these dinosaurs into the next century without tears.  Impact 2000 is a "phased
approach consisting of specialized consulting services and technology to
handle the century turnover problem."

Good.  Otherwise most mainframe system will revert at the turnover point to
the year 1900.  This worries credit card companies that bill for purchases
because buyers could dispute a VCR purchased, according to the system, 50
years before the invention of video technology.  Or imagine your discount
long-distance service charging you for a call made in 1905!

NewsNet:  The Strategist's Buzz Source

No it's not new, but it is updated daily, and a new interface makes it much
easier to use than ever before.  Based on 800 business news sources, NewsNet
is the first place to turn when doing a keyword search on markets,
competitors, ownership, "reorgs," and just about anything else imaginable.
Unlike the massive DIALOG and NEXIS databases, NewsNet focuses almost entirely
on business, and its interface isn't as difficult or intimating as are the
interfaces of other two.  (At no charge, we once did a text DIALOG search for
a book.  The on-line time amounted to a multi-hundred dollar bill as the
search was badly constructed.)  NewsNet works more like CompuServe with a
window of easy-to-use options through a Windows interface called Baton.  You
can also set up the service through NewsFlash to automatically garner articles
on a selected topic as soon as they appear on the wire.  Other options include
the availability of on-line reports and access to American Business
Information, Inc.'s data on 10 million companies and corporations within the
United States.

PLATFORM:  Windows 3.1 or better.

CD-ROMs in Print:  A CD-ROM Guide to CD-ROMs

CD-ROMs in Print is a complete guide to all the discs that fit.  Formerly a
MecklerMedia product, it's now in the hands of the Gale Research people.
Currently you can purchase Gale's new print version for $130, and the
CD-ROM-based version is being extensively revised and will become available
sometime this year.  (The Meckler version is still available from Gale, but
it's significantly out of date according to a Gale spokesperson.)

Containing about 12,000 titles made by approximately 4,000 companies, this is
equivalent to a Books in Print for CD-ROM users.  The disc includes a separate
keyword search engine for DOS and Windows.  Because both the book and the disc
contain listings for all kinds of discs (everything from games to CD-I
offerings), probably 80% of the listings won't be of interest to business
users, but the disc contains a reasonably comprehensive listing of business
CD-ROMs and demographic data discs.  Reviews from the now-defunct CD-ROM World
magazine are also included but only on select discs profiled in the magazine
before its untimely demise in 1994.

What Lies in the Future?

We could have used IntelAssist or 4Thought for this very brief conclusion, but
guesstimating is more fun.  The big growth in strategic software will be in
the area of information management-what to do with the reams of paper the
supposed paperless office produces-and in even better business forecasting
engines.  But next year, don't remind us of what we predicted in this year's
column.

Atlas Select:  Market Analysis Software For Senior Strategists

GIS software has been around since the late 1970s, but only within the past
few years has it become reasonably easy to use.  Strategic Mapping is a
long-time player in the GIS market.  Atlas Select is an extension of their
flagship, Atlas GIS.  Equipped with the kind of data sales and marketing
strategists require for in-depth analysis, this comprehensive package
overcomes one of the persistent objections to GIS technology in business:  the
need to buy data separately.

Not only do you get this excellent mapping engine, but a large quantity of
data ships with the product and is included with the purchase price.  This
includes everything from Arbitron Areas of Dominant Influence (ADO) to a
robust set of Census data.  Optional data required for in-depth analysis of
the United States is also pressed onto the same disc that includes the
product.  This includes almost any kind of information required for a
strategic analysis of markets, market share, and five-year projections of
growth.  You simply choose the datasets you desire and then purchase
"MarketData Units" from Strategic Mapping to unlock the information.  This
allows users instant access to the data they require without the wait for a
third-party data provider to deliver.  And without having to geocode or
convert incompatible data files.

Equifax purchased National Decision Systems (NDS) several years ago.  Instead
of using consumer and business credit records, all NDS data is either
carefully researched by this division or purchased from top data suppliers
across the nation.  Now Equifax/NDS offers this unique
product-ProphetPoint-which allows users to quickly quantify
business-to-business markets by number of employees, income, location,
customers, and much more.  All data can also be researched by SIC code and
size.  In fact, according to Equifax, the database contains more than 300
billion variables.

No, it's not inexpensive, but it's an awesome product for senior sales and
marketing managers in Fortune 500 companies.  It's a variation on GIS
technology in which, with a single query or two, simple answers can be
obtained from even complex data.  Although it looks much like a GIS product as
it builds maps, it is unique.  Unlike generic mapping environments,
ProphetPoint produces definitive answers to tough marketing questions within
seconds.  Need to know instantly how many matchbook manufacturers there are in
Michigan?  Then this is the product for you and your company.

Quick Insight:  Petest Your Product Strategy

Strategic planning Q & A?  Yes, Quick Insight is a useful tool for debugging
(or debunking) any kind of product-related strategic planning document.  Using
it, the Edsel would have never appeared in automobile showrooms, Sony would
have signed onto VHS early, and Newt Gingrich would have announced that he
wasn't running for President months before he did.

This software is an unusual addition to the strategic planner's weapons chest.
Its methodology helps not only experienced planners, but also those new to the
game.  Quick Insight's raison d'etre is to help users determine the strategic
justification for introducing a new product or service.  As everybody knows,
these introductions are enormously expensive in terms of both cash and
corporate resources.  A product that bombs in the marketplace not only
"outplaces" many of those unfortunate enough to have championed its
introduction, but leaves companies with egg on their faces as the press howls
about money wasted and corporate incompetence.

Quick Insight depends on the user to feed it information and then returns a
"vote" of sorts on the product or service's prospects in the marketplace.
Just the process of answering the 60 or so questions the software poses can
help strategists sold on an idea come to grips with a frank appraisal of the
product's success or failure potential.  Quick Insight looks at competitive
advantages, regulatory environment, competition, risks and benefits, the sales
channel, pricing, and promotional strategies before arriving at its "vote."

Once the questions are answered, Quick Insight produces a "score" determining
a go/no-go/needs work scenario.  According to the company, the process takes
about two hours.  (It took us about 90 minutes to study a fictional outbound
telemarketing pizza business in which the company calls people and asks if
they would like to purchase a delivered pizza for dinner.  Quick Insight
produced a resounding and completely appropriate NO to the concept!)
Completing the process produces a printed evaluation that can be used as the
underpinning of a merits (or lack thereof) of a new concept.

It's too bad that Gavilan Computer, the inventor of the first battery-based
portable personal computer, that spent $32 million in venture capital before
going bankrupt, didn't have Quick Insight at its disposal.  You do remember
Gavilan Computer, don't you?

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS STRATEGY via NewsNet
JANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996

Special Focus:  Taking Technology In Hand


ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH, LIKE CLOCKWORK, MIRIAM Wigdor arrives in the
kitchen of a Taco Bell outlet in Chicago.  She's on a mission-and it's not
stuffing hot peppers into burritos.  Instead, she pulls out an Apple Newton,
her small personal digital assistant computer, and sniffs around the
facilities.  A health inspector, her job is to spot sanitary hazards.  Aha!
Wigdor sights a potential problem and enters her observations into the
booksize, wireless Newton unit.  Next, she pulls from her carrying case a
small, compatible printer and, presto!  creates a report for the outlet
manager.  While this is taking place, her notes transfer automatically into a
file in a centralized system, enabling the company to monitor the situation in
real time.

One year ago, Taco Bell integrated personal digital assistant technology into
the food safety audit system in place at its 4,500 U.S.  outlets, says Joaquin
Palaez, senior vice president of technology and quality at the Irvine,
Calif.-based chain, a unit of PepsiCo.  The inspections are performed by an
outside firm, Audits International of Highland Park, Ill.  Previously, the
approximately 120 inspectors took notes by hand, then recopied them into the
main computer system.  Dozens of extra workers were required to transcribe the
records; up to a week passed before report copies reached outlet managers.

"We needed a system that would let managers make immediate changes," Palaez
says.  "We considered a PC-based system, but thought it would cost too much.
So we came up with the less expensive Newtons."

Personal digital assistant technology has been on the market just two years.
Yet already these portable, battery-powered computers-capable of converting
notes written by hand on their small screens into lettered text-have helped
speed up and streamline operations at a number of companies.

The technology has undergone several lifetimes of change.  The Apple Newton,
the industry leader, will enter its third generation this month when the
latest model, the 2.0, arrives in stores.  The newest Newton is three inches
by six inches, weighs one pound, and costs $699.  Apple executives say it
contains significant technical improvements over earlier versions-which some
users blasted for poor handwriting character recognition capability and
constant battery recharges.  The company says the latest model also boasts
stronger links to local and wide area phone networks for faxing and other
types of data transmission.

Next summer, Apple will launch yet another Newton-friendly innovation that
will unleash even more user functions.  A new variety of Internet Protocol
connective "stack" technology will grant Newton users access to the World Wide
Web.  Currently, Internet browsers are bound to their personal computers.  But
once the new equipment is available, Newton users will be able to enter the
Web from just about anywhere in the world where phone lines exist.

During the whirlwind development period of the last 24 months, several Newton
competitors have emerged, including the Zaurus from Sharp and Sony's Magic
Link.  "The Sharp and Sony products are not wireless, so they are not
high-powered enough for industrial operations," Robert Maire, a Morgan Stanley
technology analyst, says.  "But they can be used indoors as personal
organizers.  At this point, only the Newton is strong enough for outdoor
work."

A sub-industry of Newton-compatible products also has evolved.  The Marco and
the Envoy, both from Motorola, are hardware add-ons that enable the Newton to
take advantage of radio wave technology for wireless transmissions of data.
And new applications, designed expressly for the Newton, expand its
functionality.  Magic Cap software by General Magic in Sunnyvale, Calif., was
designed to help executives organize themselves.  AllPen Software in Los
Gatos, Calif., has written custom programs for more than 60 field users.

After a number of false starts, Apple finally seems to have positioned the
Newton shrewdly in the market.  At its 1994 debut, the diminutive computer was
pitched chiefly as a high-tech personal organizer-suitable for storing
Rolodex, scheduling, and memo information-for use by executives and
salespeople in their offices and on the road.  While the device has found some
acceptance among executives-including Walt Disney Co.  CEO Michael Eisner-many
potential users did not want to put up with the early models' poor character
recognition capability.

In fact, the early Newton's handwriting conversion problems became a running
joke on the Saturday Night Live comedy show and in the Doonesbury comic strip.
At the same time, the computer press took frequent pot shots at the memory
leaks, brief battery life, and poor desktop links that plagued the first
versions.

Gene Talsky, a technology consultant in Bedford, N.H., says the mini-computer
probably never was suited to the daily needs of most executives.  "I'm not
sure how well the product works out for a lot of the initial target audience,"
Talsky says.  "Many executives already carry a laptop when they travel and
also have a PC on their desk at work.  They don't need a personal digital
assistant, too."

After the Newton's positioning as an executive implement got a lukewarm
response from many quarters, Apple marketers began pitching it as a field
tool.

Talsky says that this set of applications appears promising:  "The devices
have a lot of interesting operational uses of interest to corporate
strategists."

Planting Cyber-Seeds

A Newton-based precision farming experiment at Monsanto Corp.  has
far-reaching possibilities.  The St.  Louis agricultural conglomerate
commissioned special mapping software from AllPen and currently is refining
the trial program at its U.S.  test farms.

"The key to precision farming is being able to make site-specific
observations," Marc Vanacht, who heads strategic planning for Monsanto's
Infield Division, explains.  "There was a time when farmers would just do
blanket spraying over vast land areas.  But fields are not homogeneous.  One
area could have a problem with infestation, while another might have
exceptional yields."

"Under the new program, we send our scouts into the fields, and they enter
observations about different land conditions into their Newtons.  Then we use
the mapping software, in conjunction with the military's global positioning
satellite program, to figure out exactly where a given area is on the map.
This allows us to make site-specific observations about where spraying is
needed."

Without the technology, the scouts would have to return from the fields,
compile their data, and key them into a computer before the company's
agronomists would be able to make a spraying recommendation.  Using the
Newton, the scouts can dispatch the data over phone lines directly to the
agricultural decision makers as the data are collected.

"The new system can produce savings of a half-day or more," Vanacht says.
"Often that's enough to save a vineyard or cotton field."

Monsanto has big plans for its new creation, beyond the agricultural
applications.  Vanacht says the company will market its hand-held mapping
technology to transportation logistics, construction, insurance, and law
enforcement organizations.  He thinks it could be sold to just about any other
type of company with a need to pinpoint the locations of delivery stations,
building sites, accident areas, and crime scenes.  If the mapping products
sell well, Monsanto probably will form a new division to develop and market
them, he says.

Making a Power Statement

For the past year, Janis Wheeler, a substation inspector at Idaho Power and
Light Co.  in Boise, Idaho, has experimented with a Newton.  She uses the
computer to make notes about the condition of the utility's equipment while
she moves around the 56 substations she oversees within a 100-mile area.

"After making inspections, I bring my Newton back to the office and hook it up
to a Macintosh," she explains.  "My notes are fed into a database and sent to
a server in our downtown office.  This allows anyone in the company to view
it.  Then they can make work orders or track the history of a piece of
equipment.  Work orders are generated automatically for pieces of equipment
that I have noted have problems."

Wheeler estimates that the technology enables her to do in three weeks the
same amount of work she used to perform in a month.  Before working with the
Newton, she brought her written notes back from the field.  Then, either she
or another worker would enter all her observations manually into the Macintosh
system.  After the data entry, the information would be analyzed, and,
finally, work orders would be issued.  These long waits were dangerous in
situations involving equipment on the verge of collapse.

Later this year, Idaho Power and Light will give Newtons to six other
substation inspectors.  The utility's management is pleased that the
technology reduces its labor requirements.  Wheeler says that since she no
longer needs to perform data-entry functions when she returns to her office,
she has been assigned additional duties.  Based on Wheeler's experience the
company expects to give new responsibilities to the other substation
inspectors after they receive their Newtons.

I Hear America Monitoring

The U.S.  federally sponsored Voice of America last year began using Newtons
to link its network of more than 150 contract workers in 47 nations who
monitor the sound quality of its educational radio programs about American
culture.  The freelancers are stationed in such far-flung places as Armenia,
Nigeria, and Myanmar.  The agency tracks broadcast caliber because it uses
short-wave radio technology, which has significant tonal variations from day
to day and place to place.

Bill Whitaker, director of monitoring resources, says the Voice of America has
devised a one-to-five scale numerical code, with five representing the highest
level of sound quality.  The monitors punch the digitized sound rankings into
their computers.  Then the numerical data is sent by telephone lines into
computers at the agency's Washington office.  Whitaker says all reports are
received within five days of broadcast.

Before adopting the new system, the Voice of America relied on the diplomatic
pouches at local U.S.  embassies-an antiquated and time-consuming method-to
convey handwritten reports back to Washington.  "It could take weeks, or even
months, to get all the reports back," Whitaker recalls.  "And then we had to
enter them in our system.  Now we have information about all our broadcasts
around the world at the end of each week."

Whitaker adds that the new digitized system also allowed the government to
further its downsizing goals by eliminating three data-entry positions.

Newton, the Next Generation

Many telephone companies use surprisingly low-tech methods to give their crews
the locations of equipment problems, assigning clerical workers to keep logs
of work orders.  Workers in repair units are forced to call in each hour or so
to receive updated job lists.

The Dracon Division of Harris Corp., a technology manufacturer in Melbourne,
Fla., is seeking to change all that with a new PDA-type device called the
Craft Digital Assistant, which would allow outdoor employees to receive
information about jobs from their computers.  These workers also could update
equipment files as they complete each task.  Printer capability would allow
them to create copies of bills and other documents on the spot to give to
customers.

The Dracon unit, based in Camarillo, Calif., received licensing rights from
Apple to create the Craft Digital Assistant, which in essence is a
water-proof, "ruggedized" version of the Newton.  The device can be dropped 10
feet without damage.

The technology is in trial stages.  Ken Selig, director of the division, says
Dracon is conducting extensive trial tests for Pacific Telephone Co., the
largest telecommunications lines provider in California.  He notes that
virtually all the other regional Bells, as well as GTE Corp.  of Stamford,
Conn., are experimenting with the Craft product.

The telephone companies are eager for this technology because it can boost
productivity while reducing labor.  In addition, the device's efficiencies
would allow these companies to reduce cycle times on many repair jobs.

In the Chips

One of the most intriguing things about PDA technology is that its ability to
gather information in real time allows companies and entrepreneurs to create
businesses that were not viable when data collection techniques were slower.
Last year Vicky Bradum, a Las Vegas entrepreneur, used Motorola's Envoy to
build a unique service for local hotels called CasinoLine.

Bradum dispatched employees to each of the town's largest casinos to keep
track of the constant changes in jackpot dollar totals.  The changes were
transmitted to Las Vegas' tourist hotels, which posted large signs advising
tourists of the locations of the biggest jackpots.  Although the operation was
discontinued this year, it remains a good example of the types of innovative
applications made possible by these devices.

The Future Is Wow

It is highly unlikely the PDA will challenge personal computers in the
business world.  But the units are carving out a healthy market share, Vadim
Zlotnikov, a technology analyst with Sanford C.  Bernstein & Co., says.  He
estimates approximately 500,000 personal digital assistants were sold in 1995,
making for a $300 million-a-year industry.  Of the 500,000 units, some 300,000
were earmarked for field operations; the remaining 200,000 were used as
personal organizers.

In Zlotnikov's view, the development of PDAs as a corporate operations tool
takes place in three stages.  The first is exemplified by the field uses being
employed by Taco Bell and Monsanto.

"The second stage will be when there is widespread use of cellular
communications to access the Internet or corporate local networks with Newtons
and similar devices," he says.  "Some of this technology is already in place.
But it has not become widely available yet.  I believe it will do so in 1996
and 1997.  It's a question of people becoming comfortable with this
technology.  When they do, we'll see many people use the Internet and company
networks routinely for their email.  People also will become just as
comfortable viewing the Internet from a PDA as from a personal computer."

The third stage will come when the use of high-band radio wave connective
technology, like Motorola's Envoy and Marco, becomes common.

"People know about these devices, but not that many companies have committed
to using them," Zlotnikov observes.  "This technology will allow massive data
transfers between PDAs and office computers.  When it becomes widespread, the
walls between being in the office and on the road will really break down.  It
will no longer matter much where one is located."

A few forward-looking companies already are in the second stage he describes.
When Apple releases its "stack" connector to the Internet this summer, a whole
new universe of business applications will open.  In creating Web sites, many
companies will want to appeal to mobile PDA-linked Net browsers-along with
users who log in from offices and homes.

With PDA and other small computer users in mind, American Airlines last year
began designing a Web site suited to miniature screens.  "You can't use as
much lettering when you have less display space," Joseph Crawley, Web Master
for American Airlines, explains.  "The idea is:  'more thought and less
text.'"

Currently, the American Airlines Web site runs 450 pages.  Among other
benefits, browsers may tap into the airline's massive SABRE computerized
reservation system to purchase tickets and access seating arrangements, or
they may learn if a certain flight is on time or has been delayed.  "This is
the type of up-to-date information that would interest Newton users, who are,
say, riding around in a car," Crawley points out.

A demonstration of the American Airlines' Web site was performed on a Newton
at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas last November.  "I don't know if it was
the advertising of the future," recalls one attendee.  "But, that tiny site
definitely was the biggest 'wow' of the show."

Special Focus:  A Tale Of Three Web Sites


Exponential figures are touted routinely for the growth in the number of
users, the number of information providers, the number of Web sites, and the
amount of money to be made on the Web.  Some of the numbers are realistic,
some are greatly exaggerated; yet, with almost 14 million unique Universal
Resource Locators (URLs)-more commonly known as home pages-currently
available, anyone can find virtually any kind of information on the Web, from
the ridiculous to the sublime.

So, is the proliferation of home pages merely a trend signal of slaves to
cyber-fashion?  Hardly.  Cottage industries have sprouted from less.  All
signs show that business is booming on the Web, across traditional and
nontraditional sectors.  Measuring success, well, that will vary from a
Fortune 100 company to an independent marketer of quality cigars.  It all
boils down to style and substance.  What is the strategy for designing,
developing, building, and operating a Web site?  Before you brush off the Web
as an electronic variation of the hula hoop, take a look at what three
different organizations-Chevron Corp.; Virtual Vineyards; and Amnesty
International-have accomplished on the Web, each with its own purpose and
individual strategy for achieving its goal.

These three Web sites stand out as examples of what can be done
on-line-marketing and selling a product; creating an image; and generating
awareness-through careful strategic planning and implementation.

CHEVRON:  Defining Corporate Image

Not everything about doing business on the Web is linked strategically to
product, sales, promotion, or marketing.  Sometimes, the information takes a
broader, corporate perspective, as Chevron Corp.  has done on its Web site
(http://www.chevron.com).  While a lot of companies developed Web sites just
for the sake of doing it, Chevron has adopted an overall corporate
communications strategy for its site.

"A lot of it has to do with positioning," Mike Libbey, Chevron's team leader
for media relations, explains.  By having a Web site, Chevron is positioned as
a leading-edge company technologically.  And by doing it well, Chevron is
positioned as a company that knows what it is doing.

"This image rubs off on people who may want to buy our products," Libbey says.
"While we're not selling fuel on our Web site, we are positioning ourselves as
experts in the area of fuel, and the Web site itself is positioning Chevron as
a company aware of the latest technology.  It provides an image of Chevron in
the minds of people that we think benefits our reputation, and, by extension,
our business."

Chevron's Web site came into being in November 1994, when Libbey started
defining content and how to propose the concept to management.  As his
exploration into the World Wide Web began, he discovered his idea was not
entirely new at Chevron.

"What we discovered was that Chevron already had an external Web site set up
for demonstration purposes developed by our information technology
subsidiary," Libbey recalls.  "They had had a conference on the Web and its
uses a few months earlier, and had set up the demonstration site with a
different URL.  But, nevertheless, it was available externally.  This actually
turned out to be a big help, since the hardware, software, URL address, and
the networking already were taken care of by our technical people.  All we
really had to do was to work with them to provide the professional content."

Libbey's department provides corporate communications services for print,
radio, and television journalists, so it was only natural for his department
also to provide the Web site content and product development.  Chevron's
information technology department provided the hardware, software, and
networking.

Chevron's Web site is developed on a Unix-based, Sun server, using Netscape
Communications software.

Internal and External Strategies

Chevron followed both an internal and external strategy in its Web site
development.  "Our internal strategy was to establish the corporate
communications department as having the responsibility and oversight for the
content," Libbey notes.  "In examining other early corporate Web sites, it was
apparent that a particular business unit within a corporation had the first
idea to put up a site, and that site reflected the business unit's views
without reflecting the overall corporation's views.  It looked like whomever
had the idea first established what they thought the site should be."

From Libbey's corporate viewpoint, these sites didn't project a wide-ranging
and complete corporate image for a broad audience.  "So our internal strategy
was from the perspective of getting our corporate flag out there, if you will,
because we are corporate professional comunicators, as opposed to marketers or
some other sector of our business."

The external strategy, according to Libbey, was to position Chevron in a
number of ways, each represented by one of the four original areas on its Web
site:  financials, operations, news and views, and what Chevron's Web site
calls the exploration zone.

Chevron's financials "page" provides comprehensive financial information for
investors, potential investors, analysts, shareholders, and anyone else who is
interested in the company's financial performance.  The operations "page"
provides information about Chevron's nearly two dozen operating companies in
the United States and overseas, in every aspect of the petroleum industry.  It
also focuses on the "human equation" behind the statistics, profiling the
people at Chevron and their work.  The news and views "page" offers current
information about Chevron, from press releases to speeches by top executives.

Chevron's fourth original "page," the exploration zone, is aimed at the wide
range of educational audiences looking for information about business,
particularly the oil industry.  The exploration zone contains articles on the
history of the oil industry, and explains the workings of various sectors of
the business, including refining and marketing.

"All of the stories in the exploration zone were already available in print
form," Libbey notes.  "We simply took articles, including art work, from our
stockholder magazine which had many interesting articles on the company, and
repackaged it for the Web.  This allows this information to have a much longer
life."

Libbey already is looking to future refinements in Chevron's Web site.  "My
regular job is manager of media relations," he notes, "so I want to provide as
much information as possible for the media.  What I would like to do in the
future, if I ever get the time, is to enhance our regular press release
material, available on PR Newswire, with additional information, such as maps,
charts, graphics, and background information that can't be put on the wire.
And when multimedia technology becomes more readily available, adding sound or
even video.  In that way, not only could you have a press release where we're
quoting our chairman's words, but you could also download the chairman's words
and watch him speaking them."

Chevron's recent addition of a products and services "page"-which provides
information on Chevron credit cards, its Techron fuel additive, and fuels
manufactured by Chevron-is another area Libbey targets for expansion.

"When you look at the credit card area, all they're doing now is explaining
the different types of credit cards Chevron offers and providing an 800 number
for people to call.  But we're looking ahead at the possibility of on-line
transactions-taking applications on-line, or even billing inquiries on-line.
We have something like 8 million Chevron credit card holders, of which 2
million to 3 million are active users.  Even a small percentage of those
coming on-line would represent thousands of people.  It's going to take a
while, but we're definitely looking at it."

Going On-Line Or Not

Chevron appears to have successfully avoided the pitfall of many Web
sites-sacrificing content for graphics.  "We evaluated several outside Web
page designers, who agreed with us that people don't want to sit there for
long downloads," Libbey recalls.  "We limited our graphics to cut download
time, and yet be attractive and informative at the same time, and our Netscape
software also provides us with much quicker downloads.  Our outside designer
also has a very good relationship with Netscape, for whom he also does work,
which keeps us extremely well informed on the leading-edge technology which we
are pursuing for our site."

Libbey's enthusiasm for the Web is laced with common-sense advice.

"If anyone else wants to develop a Web site, I would say, do it, but think
about who your audience is, what you want to say to your audience, and what
you hope to accomplish.  For example, on our products and services 'page,'
there are several things about our Techron fuel additive and answers to
questions about octane and reformulated gasoline.  These are very carefully
thought-out answers, and I think people who will read them will recognize we
have an expertise in this area, and that our fuel and other products reflect
our expertise."

VIRTUAL VINEYARDS:  A Megabyte, A Jug of Wine, And Thou

One of the earliest developers and practitioners of interactive marketing is a
small company based in Los Altos, Calif., called Virtual Vineyards
(http://www.virtualvin.com).  But don't look for any wine-tasting parties or
tours of its rustic wineries.  In fact, the only way to sample its vintages is
through the World Wide Web.

"Virtual Vineyards is strictly a Web-based company," Robert Olson, president
and co-founder, says.  "When we get the odd telephone or fax order, we put it
into the system by having a clerk use a Web browser, exactly as if the user
had put it in himself.  Older businesses translate Web-based orders into their
existing telephone or paper-based systems; we go the opposite way."

The company is an electronic direct marketing channel for more than 50
wineries and food producers.  Virtual Vineyards doesn't just create Web pages.
"We select the foods and wines, stock them in our warehouse, promote the
products, process orders, and manage fulfillment logistics," Olson explains.

Wine On-Line

Olson didn't start out in wine making or marketing.  In his case, the
technical skills came first, the marketing concept second, and the product
last.

"I got interested in the power of personalized, interactive marketing while
working on an Interactive Television project," he says.  "In many ways, the
Internet is a better vehicle for what we are doing than is Interactive TV,
since it is a more open architecture platform.  I decided that the time had
come for me to do something on my own."

In early 1994, Olson started talking to various retailers about investing in
interactive marketing and interactive stores, but he didn't make much
progress.  "They all just kind of looked at me and said, 'I've got about
$5,000 left in my advertising budget, what can you do with that?' and I said
'Frankly, not much.'"

It was during a conversation with his brother-in-law, Peter Granoff, about the
trials and tribulations of launching a venture that Olson decided he needed to
build a demonstration store "for people to be able to figure out what I was
talking about."

"What I was looking for was something that had three characteristics," he
recalls.  "First, it had to be an information-oriented product, something
where information at the point of sale had a major influence in the purchasing
decision.  I included wine in that category, even though at that time I didn't
know it was wine that would ultimately become our product line.  The second
thing is, it needed to be a product with a distribution problem-a specialty
oriented product as opposed to a commodity-because I didn't particularly want
to be in competition with Safeway, or WalMart, or any other large chain."

The third necessity was having a content expert.

"What I was talking about was in effect a distribution business, which can
live or die based upon both producer and consumer relationships," Olson notes.
"So I needed someone who understood those relationships, to give us a better
chance.  That pretty much described the wine business, and that's about the
way it worked.  Peter was ready for a change, I needed somebody who understood
the product, wine is certainly something that has a lot of appeal to a lot of
people, and thereby hangs the tale."

Granoff, a Master Sommelier, certainly had the background to be content
expert.  Granoff is only the thirteenth American admitted to the British Court
of Master Sommeliers and currently serves as an Examiner and Board of
Directors member for the Court's American Chapter.  In 1991, he received the
James Beard Foundation Sommelier of the Year Award.  Granoff serves as
consulting sommelier and wine director for San Francisco's Square One
restaurant and as visiting lecturer for The Sterling Vineyards School of
Service and Hospitality.

Coming from a computer background at Silicon Graphics, Olson had a pretty good
idea of most of the technical issues involved in setting up a Web site.  "So
Peter knows the products, knows the suppliers, and has a handle on why
customers buy what they do," Olson says.  "I know the computers and the Net."

The initial site was built on an Intel platform manufactured by Micron, using
a Unix operating system.  Virtual Vineyards utilizes the Netsite Commerce
Server from Netscape Communications, a Sybase database, and an ordering
software package called Open Orders from Custom Software.

Marketing The Marketing

"When we first started out, it wasn't too difficult to develop an interest in
our product," Olson notes.  "People were intrigued with what we were doing."

Virtual Vineyards was one of the first Internet-based marketers, and
consequently, the venture received a tremendous amount of publicity as
interest in the Internet and the World Wide Web was growing.

"We have discovered, in general, press coverage works better than
advertising," Olson observes.  "I don't know why that it is, but I think it
may be due to the current crop of users on the Internet.  They may, in fact,
be less susceptible to advertising than your average human being, but all that
may change."

Has Olson been able to turn the publicity into a successful operation?
Virtual Vineyards is privately held-investors include Applied Technology
Partners, Lexington, Mass.; Alpine Technology Ventures, Cupertino, Calif; and
four private individuals, including Olson-and Olson is reluctant to give out
financial data.  He says the company "has been meeting the expectations of its
backers, which is a very important objective."  Published reports have noted
that Virtual Vineyards processes orders for tens of thousands of dollars worth
of wine every month on the Web, with expectations for monthly sales to exceed
$100,000 for December.

It doesn't appear to be too difficult to generate awareness of the Web site.
Virtual Vineyards gets its message out through three different avenues.  The
company buys ads on other on-line service providers, such as America Online
and Prodigy, but Olson says this route "is only marginally effective."

The second avenue is through the traditional channels of the press and various
on-line conferences.  "We've been interviewed on CNN and National Public
Radio, and have had articles about us in USA Today and the New York Times, for
example.  And every time a story comes out, we see a pretty good hit in
on-line traffic, which convinces us it works."

The third way is via word-of-mouth.  "We currently are running a discount gift
promotion to stimulate additional holiday sales," Olson notes at the close of
1995, "because gifts get two people instead of one."

Keeping an Eye on Business

Virtual Vineyards' parent company, Net Contents, Inc., provides computer and
Internet services.  It also consults in the design and implementation of
electronic stores for other companies, including a number of wineries.  Olson
likens the process to working with an architect in the design of a new
building:  The first questions revolve around priorities.

"If you measure success in sales through the channel, you make one set of
choices about content, navigation, maintenance, back office support, and so
forth.  If your goal is to get lots of visitors and cultivate a 'cool' company
image, you make other choices.  Once you know how you are going to measure
your success, it becomes much easier to build a successful site," he observes.

"We specialize in transaction-oriented sites, building everything around
delivering products to customers.  'Cool' in our context means customer
service and value added.  I attribute our success to staying focused on this
business objective.  There is nothing wrong with the many other models on the
Net.  But success on the Web comes from knowing why you are doing the project,
and staying true to your vision."

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL:  Freedom Through Information

It's often said that one person can't make a difference in this world.  Well,
one person can, if that person is hooked into the Internet, and, more
specifically, into Amnesty International's numerous international, national,
and local Web sites.  ("Official" Web site:
http://www.io.org/amnesty/overview.html; U.S.  sites
include:http://www.traveller.com/~hrweb/ai/ai.html and
http://www.gatech.edu/amnesty/international.html).

Amnesty International's mandate-to free all prisoners of conscience detained
for the nonviolent expression of their beliefs, fair and prompt trials for
political prisoners, and an end to torture and executions-is well suited to
the worldwide communications and information gathering and processing
capabilities of the Internet.  Since it first went on-line a little more than
a year ago, the World Wide Web has allowed more than 1.1 million Amnesty
International members, subscribers, and donors in more than 150 countries and
territories, and more than 8,000 Amnesty International volunteer groups in
more than 70 countries, to report on, monitor, and take action against human
rights violations worldwide almost instantaneously.

"The Internet has enabled us to mobilize our members and others around the
world, " Robin Bernard, director of information technology, says.  "It also
has allowed us to become aware of potential and actual human rights violations
that would not have gotten out otherwise, or would have taken a long time to
get out."

Human Rights Awareness

When Amnesty International first started looking at the Web as an information
and communications tool, the group saw a number of reasons.  "First, we
realized it would be an invaluable human rights tool, by providing human
rights information and education to a wide audience," Bernard says.  "We
wanted to enable people to get involved in saving lives and preventing human
rights abuses immediately with the click of a button.  It also provides us a
means to communicate and collaborate with our volunteers, staff, and members
across the Net in a cost-effective and timely manner."

Amnesty International also uses the Net to promote membership in the
organization, and distributes its publications through its Web sites, as well
as income-generating merchandise such as tee shirts and calendars.  Generating
income is an important strategy for Amnesty International.

"Our system now is set up through volunteers, and various organizations and
universities have given us computer space and time with which to operate on
the Net," Bernard explains.  "We would like to set up our Web site in-house,
to help us be even more effective, if the funding were available."

The Internet and the World Wide Web are especially well suited to non-profit
organizations like Amnesty International, given the lack of communications
networks and options, and government control over communications, in many of
the countries Amnesty International monitors for human rights violations.

"The Internet is virtually the only way to communicate globally in a number of
countries," Bernard says.  During the coup against then Pres-ident Gorbachev
in Russia, for example, most lines of communications in Russia, particularly
in and around Moscow, were cut off.  Initial reports and early confirmation of
the attempted coup were first learned worldwide through individuals and
organizations communicating through the Internet, Bernard notes.

Amnesty International programs such as the Regional Action Network and the
Urgent Action Network are greatly enhanced by use of the Internet.  The 21
Regional Action Networks concentrate their activities on any one of five
regions of the world to assist people subjected to any of the human rights
abuses that Amnesty International opposes in almost all of the world's
countries.

Human Rights Action

Amnesty International's Urgent Action Network consists of a streamlined
procedure for finding and responding to urgent information about threatened
individuals and quickly getting it to a pool of concerned people who agree to
be "on call" to send immediate letters, faxes, telegrams, and aerograms to
government authorities regarding torture, capital punishment, ill-treatment,
extrajudicial execution, disappearance, untreated health problems, death
threats, denial of legal counsel, unacknowledged detention, and forced
repatriation.

An Urgent Action includes specific details about the prisoner as well as
background information regarding relevant patterns of human rights violations
in the country, recommended actions, addresses of responsible governmental
authorities, and general guidelines to use when composing appeals.  Amnesty
International issues several Urgent Actions daily and delivers each one to a
portion of the Urgent Action Network.

Since the largest portion of the Urgent Action Network is made up of
individual letter-writers, the Web is an efficient, cost-effective way to
reach thousands of people simultaneously, Bernard acknowledges.  "The Web
gives us the opportunity to let people know what Amnesty International is,
what we do, and how to get involved," she says.

And like its organizational, educational, and commercial counterparts on the
Web, Amnesty International is carefully watching technological advances and
planning its future Web strategy accordingly.

Technology Assists Strategy

A longer term strategy can be difficult to pinpoint when dealing with the
World Wide Web.

"The way in which the Web is expanding and technology is advancing, we'll
probably be doing things on the Web and using it in ways we can't even imagine
today," Bernard believes.  Amnesty International already uses photographs
extensively on the Web and plans to increase its graphics use.  "It means much
more, and has a greater impact, if you can show the faces along with the
facts," Bernard says.

"And as the technology becomes more available, multimedia capabilities,
including not only words and pictures, but sound, film, and video, will also
become part of our Web strategy," Bernard observes.  "We hope that it will
help our members and other interested persons by giving them information, and
answers to their questions more quickly, and provide the kinds of services to
help us achieve our mandate.  In the commercial world, I guess you would call
that customer service.  In our area, I guess it would be service to humanity."

Special Focus:  Cyber-Strategy


A FEW MONTHS AGO, ALCOA ANNOUNCED THE LARGEST information technology project
in its history, an overhaul of its basic computer infrastructure.  The $150
million effort will span 26 countries and take several years to complete, and
is considered so strategic that Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, cites his
"personal involvement and commitment to the project."

The effort is ambitious and complicated, but the goal is elegantly simple and
clear:  Let employees around the globe communicate quickly and easily.  When
the new systems are in place, Keith Turnbull, Alcoa's executive vice president
of strategic analysis/planning and information, says, "The person who has an
opportunity and wants to share it can, and the person who has a problem can
find help."

Alcoa's initiative reflects a basic fact of life in the use of strategic
information technology (IT).  Today, IT is focused increasingly on creating
connections-between employees, across functions, with customers, and between
data and decision makers.

To forge those links, companies have rushed with great fanfare and urgency
into client-server technologies, global networking projects, and extensive
reengineering programs.  Many have succeeded and found competitive advantage
in their technology.  But many others haven't.  "When I talk to CEOs and
senior managers, they tell me information technology is much more important
today than it used to be," Larry DeJarnett, vice president of A.T.  Kearney in
Chicago, says.  "But it still takes too long and costs too much, and when it's
done it too often doesn't deliver what they thought they were going to get."

For example, client-server and distributed systems-in which some or all of the
computing load is moved off the mainframe and onto smaller computers-now are
central to most IT strategies.  But some 75% of client-server projects fail,
according to Cambridge Market Intelligence in England.

At times, those failures can reach epic proportions, Bill Carico, president of
the ACTS consulting firm based in Marble Falls, Texas, says.  He cites
published reports of National Westminster Bank's troubled $300 million branch
system that will take several years longer than expected to get up to speed; a
U.S.  Army National Guard system created for thousands of users that sometimes
takes two days to handle an email message; and an extensive EuropCar system
that turned out to be so complicated it "collapsed under its own weight" on
its first day in operation.

Faced with such sobering examples, many executives are approaching strategic
IT projects with a renewed sense of caution and realism, "moving from where
the rubber meets the sky to where the rubber meets the road," Carico says.

At the heart of this trend is a basic tenet:  The effective, strategic use of
information systems relies less on the latest and greatest technology, and
more on how the technology is managed.  And so companies are spending more
time up front, at higher levels in the organization, thinking about how
systems should be evaluated, deployed, maintained, and targeted to specific
business opportunities and problems.

What Kind of Systems?

Increasingly, such thinking revolves around the customer, and progressive
corporate IT departments are investing in technologies that aim to improve
product quality and variety, hone marketing efforts, and enhance customer
service.

These technologies include networks that give frontline employees the product
information they need to help customers on the spot; point-of-sale systems
that let retailers gather data on purchasing patterns and shorten checkout
lines; voice systems that let banks offer phone-based services; and
sophisticated databases that let companies develop detailed profiles of
customers' tastes.

In an age where virtually every company touts its love of the customer, that
hardly seems like leading-edge thinking.  But in fact, IT traditionally has
focused on administrative, backroom operations.  DeJarnett says executives
often are surprised at just how inwardly attuned their systems are.  For
example, when a Fortune 500 manufacturer he advises recently examined its IT
usage, it found only about 30% of its IT resources were oriented toward
external customers and 70% were focused on internal customers.  "That company,
and others I've talked to since, think it's important to shift that balance
pretty dramatically," DeJarnett says.

When companies do make that shift, they often find that some of the internal
systems they've been operating are unnecessary, according to DeJarnett.  When
considering a new system, he advises:  "Put yourself in the customer's chair
and see if you care.  That will tell you a whole lot about many control
systems and financial systems.  Customers could care less what kind of
internal exercises you go through.  They just want the product or service on
time at the right price."

There seems to be a clear payoff from using IT to reach customers.  Erik
Brynjolfsson, associate professor of management at MIT's Sloan School,
recently compared the performance of companies with customer-oriented IT
strategies and those that had more traditional cost-reduction strategies.  "We
found that the customer-oriented ones had substantially higher productivity
and profitability," he says.  "The information technology enables them to have
a richer level of information flow between the company and the customers, and
to give their line employees the information they need to make decisions.  The
companies that used the technology in that way showed a benefit beyond just
saving dollars."

Taking Control

While deploying those frontline systems, companies are developing strategies
to re-establish some degree of central control over them.  As companies moved
from mainframes to distributed systems, buying power shifted from central
information systems (IS) organizations to business units.  According to the
Gartner Group, Stamford, Conn., consultants, 60% to 70% of IT spending now is
done outside of the IS organization.

Too often, Kearney's DeJarnett says, "that creates a version of anarchy, with
everybody doing their own thing."  Departmental systems, bought with no
overall plan in place, often can't work with other departmental systems.
What's more, the variety of systems makes it difficult for technical experts
from centralized IS departments to provide maintenance and assistance, meaning
such tasks fall to "underground support" groups, nontechnical employees end up
spending a lot of time fixing and fine-tuning their computers, rather than
doing their jobs.

Dispersed control over PCs also makes it difficult to target and control
spending at a strategic level.  Gartner Group surveys show that companies
typically spend 5.8% of their total revenues on IT.  Of that, 2% is
centralized IS spending; 2.3% is done by business units, and 1.5% is
unaccounted for.  By 1999, companies indicate their IT spending will reach
8.9% of revenues; 1.6% will be controlled centrally, 5.6% decentrally, and
1.6% will be "lost in the sauce," William Kirwin, a vice president in
Gartner's management of information technology group, says.

Not surprisingly, many executives are rethinking their decentralized buying
strategies.  But that does not mean turning back the clock to return total
power to the technicians.  "IS departments are looking for ways to influence
purchases made by the business units," Kirwin says.  "It's not so much a
question of centralization versus decentralization as it is realizing that
there is going to be a hybrid split of responsibility."

In some companies, that influence is taking the form of standards that
business units must comply with in making purchases.  Typically, the IT
department will dictate what sort of underlying technologies to buy, such as
operating systems and network software.  As a result, maintenance is simpler,
and systems across the company can work together.  For their part, the
business units are then free to use a variety of application software, the
programs they really use to run their business.

Such standards provide an effective balance between central control and
decentralized flexibility and save money along the way.  "Companies that have
gone through these rigorous standardization programs report that their total
cost of PC ownership has gone down by 20% to 30%, which may translate to a
couple of thousand dollars per user per year," Kirwin says.

Handing It Off

At some organizations, the debate over who manages what part of the IT
function is taken to another level.

"We're seeing an increasing willingness on the part of executives to consider
outsourcing," Allie Young, a senior industry analyst at Dataquest in
Westborough, Mass., observes.  Her firm estimates that outsourcing, a $67
billion business worldwide in 1994, will grow to $141 billion by 1999, not
including various types of IT consulting.

More important than the dollar amounts, however, is the changing nature of
outsourcing, she says.  Traditionally, outsourcing has been a cost-cutting
tool; companies would turn their systems over to a vendor so they could get
assets off their books and downsize their staffs.  But a growing trend, Young
says, is to tie outsourcing to larger, longer-term initiatives and to look at
vendors as strategic partners.

The key:  selective outsourcing.  As its name implies, selective outsourcing
lets companies pick and choose what to outsource, rather than just handing
over the total management of systems to a vendor.  So a company might elect to
break off mundane, day-to-day data-center operations to allow its IS staff to
focus on new strategic technologies, and management to focus on core
competencies.  Or, conversely, it might bring a vendor in to help with a
specific transition to a new technology.  "There's whole host of new options,"
Young says.  "It's not a situation where you're in a contract and you're in it
for life.  Vendors are approaching customers with much more of a blank sheet
of paper."

All this flexibility makes it easier to use outsourcing as a strategic tool.
By partnering with a vendor, a firm no longer has to keep pace with rapidly
changing technology on its own-an increasingly difficult task, even for a
large corporation with a bright and able IT staff.

"Those people just don't have access to the same kinds of resources as does a
company that is 100% focused on information technology," according to Tim
Bourgeois, a research analyst at International Data Corp.  in Framingham,
Mass.  "They don't have the research and development, and they don't have the
access to the emerging tools and products that change every 18 months."

Outsourcing can be used to shorten the time to market for a critical new
system by giving a corporation a quick infusion of expertise.  "A company may
be looking at the strategic advantage they can gain by implementing a global
client-server customer-service solution, or perhaps a retailer wants to put in
a new system that links its retail operations with its distributors," Young
says of outsourcing.  "It gives you access to experts that have done this
before and know how to roll it out."

Young points out that several vendors are starting to extend their services
into areas beyond the IS department.  "We're seeing an emerging concept called
business process management, which is going to be real important going
forward," Young says.  In this approach, traditional vendors such as Andersen
Consulting or EDS take on and re-engineer an entire IT-intensive business
process, such as accounting, human resources, or customer service.  "These
areas are usually not core competencies for a company," she notes.  "But they
are important, and there is value in making sure they don't become stagnant."

Measuring Up

Without a doubt, the most fundamental question in strategic IT is whether it's
worth it.  And the evidence suggests that on a macro level, at least, the
answer is yes.  In a recent study, MIT's Brynjolfsson looked at overall
productivity and IT expenditures at several hundred major corporations.  "We
found that IT investment was very significantly correlated with large
increases in productivity," he says.  "The estimated return on information
technology investments was on the order of 60%, which was a lot higher than a
return on other types of capital investments."

But on a more detailed level, executives have been frustrated in attempts to
measure and justify specific systems.  Many experts believe that traditional
return-on-investment financial calculations are too narrow in scope.  "We're
seeing a reaction to the whole early 1990s school of IS strategy, which tended
to focus on very short-term payback projects- which meant in a lot of
companies that the basic IT infrastructure has gone to hell in a handbasket,"
Brian Jeffrey, managing director of the International Technology Group in
Mountain View, Calif., says.

That short-term view also tends to miss larger trends, Jeffrey notes.  For
example, in 1994 banks invested heavily in putting PCs into branch offices.
But at the same time, emerging alternatives such as phone and on-line
banking-as well as ATMs-were starting to make branches less and less popular.

"In 1994, there were 54,000 bank branches in the country; by the year 2000
there will be less than 20,000," he says.  "So they were focusing on putting a
PC on every desk, and rather missed the point that half the desks are going to
disappear."

The larger problem is that traditional financial methods simply don't measure
what IT does best-support innovation.  "When IT is used effectively, it
doesn't just do more of the same, it does things like improve product variety
and quality and customer service," Brynjolfsson says.  "These are things that
are not easy to measure."

It's clear that research and debate about how to measure IT's value will
continue for some time.  But overall, experts are moving toward a broader view
of what technology contributes to an organization, taking into account such
things as how it affects processes and customers.

John Scholes, president of Regent Associates International, an East Hartland,
Conn., firm that advises companies in the IT industry, believes executives
should not unravel IT from the rest of their businesses.  "What they ought to
be doing is stepping up a level, and asking, 'How do I best organize my
business?' And then ask how IT enables that," he says.

Thornton May, vice president of research and education at Cambridge Technology
Partners in Cambridge, Mass., cites a need for methods that recognize the
value of organizational knowledge and the ability to collaborate to leverage
that knowledge.

"What we are finding is progressive organizations are moving from the 'How
many clerks did I kill today?' view, to more of a bid-and-ask type negotiation
session, where they ask themselves, 'What is this chunk of functionality
worth?'" May says.  "For example, they might ask what it's worth to have email
that takes you point-to-point around the organization.  Then, they ask how
much it costs, and then they start negotiating.  So the new paradigm is
basically a case-by-case negotiation of whether a project makes sense."

Finally, many observers recommend that strategists resist the sense of urgency
that often surrounds new technology, and take time to look before they leap-to
weigh a system's value and test the concept.  And, as ITG's Jeffrey points
out, they should remember:  "None of it is quick, none of it is easy, and none
of it is cheap.  There aren't any simple answers."

LABOR LAW REFORM: GRASSROOTS GET THEIR SAY

Much of the testimony so far before
the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management
Relations (aka Dunlop Commission) has come from superstars
in the labor-management community international union
presidents, corporate CEOs, heads of national trade
associations, and similar ilk. At a recent conference of
the Industrial Relations Research Association, however,
soldiers on the front lines got their chance to give the
view from the trenches.

The occasion was an invitation to IRRA chapters around the
country to debate issues involving the "high performance"
workplace and present their findings to the Commission at
IRRA's annual meeting in Boston. While membership varies
from chapter to chapter, most local groups are roughly
similar in composition to the Arizona Industrial Relations
Association at 40 percent each from management and labor,
and 20 percent neutrals. The chapters' heterogenous makeup
guaranteed there wouldn't be unanimity on every issue, but
most clearly made earnest efforts to respond to issues
posed as they appeared to them the organizers, contract
administrators, human resources staff, mediators and
arbitrators who make the labor relations system work.

Labor: "It Is Significant ..."

The chapters were asked the by-now standard set of
questions about whether amendments are necessary to
current labor law, especially with respect to employee
participation in the workplace. Labor law changes provoked
the sharpest differences between labor and management
representatives, prompting the AFL-CIO's Sheldon Friedman
from the Washington chapter to observe, "It is significant
that the NLRA, a law enacted to protect workers' rights
and organize, now has defenders in the management
community and nowhere else."

The reason for this, Friedman and other labor delegates
asserted, is that labor is getting killed by the NLRA as
currently interpreted and enforced. Friedman presented a
dismal series of research findings showing among other
things that in the past 20 to 30 years: (1) consent
elections (where the employer raises no barrier to a union
recognition ballot by employees) plummeted from 45% of all
elections to nearly zero; (2) reasonably quick (within 2
months of filing) union elections were cut almost in half;
(3) the percentage of recognition petitions filed and
subsequently withdrawn has jumped by over one-third; and
(4) there has been a nearly 60% rise in the number of
union election victories that don't result in a first
contract. Other findings by Friedman showed a direct
correlation between delay in holding elections and union
election losses.

Given management's success in utilizing the NLRA to
achieve these results, it's hardly surprising that, as the
Philadelphia chapter's report commented, "for the
management labor lawyers ... there is nothing proposed
[for NLRA changes] that would get their participation and
in general they are satisfied with the status quo."

Still, a number of chapters stressed dissatisfaction with
obstructive delays by both labor and management. "The
current system supports the party choosing to delay the
process, whether for organizing, bargaining, strikes,
grievances or arbitration," the Arizona IRRA chapter
pointed out. Several suggestions to speed up the process
and "make the playing field more level" kept reappearing
in a number of chapter reports (although not necessarily
agreed to by every chapter member). Some items on the wish
lists were:
* Unions should be able to be recognized without an
election based on 51 percent of the unit signing cards.
* Require binding arbitration where contract settlements
are not reached within a set period of time after initial
certification of a bargaining unit.
* Extend the election bar from one to three years after
certification.
* Expand the definition of "employee" to include such
groups as independent contractors.
* Enact the striker replacement bill.
* Union representation would improve if non-dues-paying
members of the bargaining unit were required to pay some
costs.
* Limit appeal rights. NLRB decisions should be self-
enforcing.
* Labor and management consultants should be held liable
along with their clients for labor law violations.

Worker Participation - The Pros Predominate

Although the Central Florida chapter noted its union
delegates "believed that workers gained more benefits by
being adversarial rather than cooperative," a majority of
chapter reports stressed members' "strong support for
cooperative relationships" including the sort of worker-
management cooperative committees now virtually outlawed
by the NLRB in its Electromation line of decisions. While
some chapters urged overturning Electromation, others,
like the Cincinnati chapter, said no change is necessary
since "in practice, the decision appears to have had
little effect on cooperative efforts because companies
tend to do whatever is in their best interests regardless
of case law."

Chapter reports contained a number of similar suggestions
for improving the process, many asking for more training
in problem-solving, communications skills, consensus
decision making (possibly organized through institutes,
the FMCS or area labor-management committees), and
networks of "best-practice" companies that could serve as
models.

Several chapters warned that good faith on both sides is
essential. "A project for improved productivity,"
commented the Iowa report, "should not mask a management
goal to ... coincidentally reduce the work force and/or
lower wages. This appears to be a major employee/union
concern." Iowa went on to note that, "Experience indicates
that success in cooperative efforts is diminished where
there is a lack of adequate resources, a lack of support
at the top level of management, a lack of initial and
continued focus on the objects of the cooperative effort,
a lack of continued monitoring...and a failure to
recognize accomplishments on a team basis."

Arizona, in a particularly thoughtful and comprehensive
report, pointed to the success of cooperative efforts at
Magma Copper, "which could not have continued operation at
its southern Arizona location if not for the contributions
of the union and its membership." Its summary of the
project noted: "...64 work teams were developed;
management levels reduced from seven to three. Fifteen
year contract ratified by 60 percent of the membership 9
months before expiration. Results: 1992 gainsharing $4,700
per employee, production costs decreased 7 percent, 15
percent total cost reduction per pound of copper,
productivity increased 61 percent over 3 1/2 years."

Unclassifiable Chapter Comments

*  The Cincinnati chapter suggested that collective
bargaining agents be "required to have some
training`driver's education'before they are permitted to
negotiate a contract or call a legal strike."
*  The Iowa chapter reached for the millennium and urged
that "the traditional adversarial relationship between
employees/unions and employers must be eliminated... This
obviously will require a significant change in the
existing labor laws [and] regulations."

REVIVED IDEAS RUMBLE ALONG THE POTOMAC

That murmur of shock and dismay you hear coming
from Washington probably isn't from blue noses protesting
the latest scandal du jour, but from "free rider" federal
employees facing the possibility of having to pay for
union services in units where they have exclusive
representation. While this "agency shop" idea itself isn't
new it represents a dream of federal employee unions going
back to President Kennedy's executive order granting them
limited bargaining rights in the early 1960s up until now
no one ever gave it much of a chance.

What has changed things are details of a proposal leaked
this week from a working group of the National Partnership
Council, a committee of union representatives and
administration officials set up by President Clinton last
October to recommend changes in civil service laws.
Addressing dues and fees the working group proposes: "In
any unit in which voluntary membership has reached 60
percent, all bargaining unit employees shall elect either
to (a) join the union; or (b) pay a fair share service
fee...If a bargaining unit employee objects on religious
grounds to providing financial support to the union, the
employee shall pay an amount equal to a fair share service
fee to a designated charity." In units below 60%
membership, the report proposes a "fee for service"
arrangement, whereby nonunion employees could pay the
union to perform a specific service, such as filing a
grievance.

While a hard copy of the leaked proposals remains to be
seen, a source from a union with a seat on the Council
tells LT that the details of the agency shop proposal as
we've reported them are essentially correct. The
administration hopes to send legislation implementing a
new federal labor-management framework to Congress this
spring. The NPC report should be released by the end of
the month, we're told.

Latest figures show that about 59 percent of federal
workers some 1.27 million work in units where unions have
exclusive bargaining rights. If all of them are required
to pay dues, federal employee union coffers not to mention
clout should increase appreciably.

NLRB CASELAW FORECAST LINING UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS

The bulk of the latest annual report from
the Labor Board General Counsel shows how the Lechmere and
Electromation precedents still bedevil the labor relations
scene. As readers of these pages know, in Lechmere the
U.S. Supreme Court gave employers virtually an unqualified
right to keep union organizers off their property, while
in Electromation the NLRB banned most types of employee
participation committees as unlawful employer domination
of a worker group.
The NLRB has never liked Lechmere, and in similar cases
that have come up it has found reasons to distinguish the
facts and arrive at a different result (LT 12/4/93). In
its report the GC looks at three cases where union
organizers were thrown off property by employers and
decides all are different enough from Lechmere to warrant
filing unfair labor practice charges. In one case the GC
says the union had a stronger right of access to the
property because it had represented the employees until
the employer withdrew recognition following contract
expiration and impasse. The second situation involved a
ban on union election activity by off-duty employees in
nonwork areas. In the third case the GC found that
nonemployee union agents had a right to distribute
handbills at the front entrance to a neutral employer's
store protesting use of a nonunion subcontractor. In its
brief to the Board the GC argued that "the union had
carried its `heavy' burden of proof that no other
reasonable means of communicating with the public
existed."

Several Electromation-type cases prompt pages of
discussion showing that the General Counsel is in
essential agreement with the Board's reservations against
activities of employee participation groups. In one case,
the GC says that while an employer was within its rights
to negotiate with a union over quality circles, it
couldn't bargain the subject to impasse and then implement
the circles unilaterally (in other words, it was a
permissive, not mandatory subject of bargaining). In
another case, the GC argued that a joint safety committee
was unlawful even though it was set up under a state law
requiring such committees be established. The NLRA
preempts state laws that interfere with the collective
bargaining process, the GC notes.

What it all means: No matter what the Supreme Court, Labor
Secretary Reich and the Dunlop Commission say, the NLRB
has its own ideas on labor policy. Expect more bites out
of Lechmere in 1994, and at least until the Commission
proposes and Congress passes explicit waivers under the
NLRA continued strong suspicion of any joint employer-
employee productivity efforts.

REPORTS AND STUDIES BENEFIT COSTS VS. SALARY HIKES

Last week we reported government figures
showing how health care costs are eating into the total
benefits pie. Now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce releases
its latest annual survey that finds the cost of benefits
up 3.8 percent continues to outpace increases in salaries
up only 1.4 percent. As if that wasn't bad enough,
employees' disposable pay in effect went down. According
to CoC, "the average employer's share of medical and
medically related costs per employee remained virtually
unchanged at 10.3 percent of payroll, while the total cost
was up 1 percent....As a result, employees had to pay 9
percent more in 1992 for health care coverage, in addition
to increased deductibles in many firms." Overall benefit
costs varied widely by industry, the Chamber finds, from
slightly more than 30 percent for retailers, banks and
apparel manufacturers, to more than 40 percent for primary
and fabricated metals, machinery, transportation and
rubber industries.

STATISTICS MAVENS TAKE NOTE

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is changing its method of
calculating unemployment as of this month. BLS
Commissioner Katherine Abraham says the new method will
inflate the reported numbers by 0.4 percent.

C&L SPAIN MAY SUE E&Y OVER RAID

Coopers & Lybrand in Spain may sue Ernst & Young following E&Y's
surprise attack on C&L's consulting division. On November 16, six of
C&L's 12 consulting partners, including the division's managing partner
Jose Ramon Magarzo, and three senior consultants, announced their
decision to leave the firm and join Ernst & Young. Since then, a
further 70 consultants have jumped ship, bringing the total number of
departures, as MCI went to press, to about 80. In addition, some seven
to eight administrative staff have switched firms.

The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, have struck a
severe blow to the firm's thriving consulting business which reported
turnover of Pta2.67 billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three times
that of E&Y. According to C&L's spokesperson, the firm had just
returned to profitability after several difficult years during Spain's
recession.

Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director of
E&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managing
director. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have been
made partners at E&Y.

"From Ernst & Young's point of view, this was part of a plan we started
a couple of years ago when I came from the US, and that was to increase
the size of E&Y in Spain," McKay said. "It became clear to us that to
achieve the growth, we needed to become a competitive force. We
couldn't do it through internal growth, we needed external resources at
a senior level. That included bringing in as managing director a
Spaniard who would run the practice."

E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but did
not specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the ex- C&L partners
were attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & Young Consultores is a
separate firm with its own profit pool.

The raid is by no means E&Y's first attempt to build a strong
consulting arm in Spain. Two previous efforts - the creation of a
consulting division when Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in
1990 and the 1993 establishment of E&Y Consultores with the financial
backing of E&Y in the US - have not been as successful as the firm
would have liked. In 1995, E&Y had consulting turnover of only Pta895
million and is reported to have suffered substantial losses.

Although head-hunting operations are not uncommon, the scale of E&Y's
raid is without precedent and has been perceived by C&L as a direct
attempt to steal a large slice of its business and seriously damage the
firm. C&L accuses E&Y of inducing its former partners to break their
legal commitments to the firm by offering financial compensation to
staff to leave C&L without giving the legally-required 15 days' notice.

This is denied by McKay."We believe we have acted in accordance with
the laws and contractual obligations of all the people. We have not
taken any projects from them, we have not taken any clients from them.
The people who have joined us have joined us of their own free will and
exercised their professional rights in the marketplace."

C&L believes E&Y's action infringes a number of fair trade rulings laid
down by Spain's competition laws and is considering legal action
against E&Y as well as individual proceedings against the former
partners. E&Y denies any attempt to steal C&L's current projects and
has offered to `lend' C&L its former consultants to finish projects
already in hand, an offer which C&L describes as cynical and not worthy
of consideration.

KPMG CONSULTING DRIVES 1995 GROWTH UP

Consulting drove growth at KPMG during 1995 with consulting revenues up
by 28 percent to $1.5 billion. Overall revenues for the firm were $7.5
billion, up 13 percent over 1994.

The strong growth in consulting and elsewhere comes as KPMG repositions
itself as a professional services advisory firm. However, it should be
borne in mind that the figures reflect total billings to clients, not
net fee income as KPMG has reported in the past.

In 1994, KPMG reported net fee income of $990 million in consulting and
$6.1 billion in firm-wide revenues. Also in 1994, the firm redefined
consulting services to include compensation and benefits and tax
consulting services. MCI estimated KPMG's 1994 management consulting
revenues at $875 million (MCI 70).

In 1995, the US consulting practice performed best, posting growth of
37 percent to $830 million (MCI 73). Growth in Europe was
"substantially better" after a relatively flat year in 1994 due to
restructuring, according to Keith Fuller, international head of the
Management Consulting Services committee.

Asia Pacific also performed well although from a relatively small base.
Further expansion is planned there. While Fuller would not reveal
target markets, the likely candidates are Japan, Korea, Singapore, Hong
Kong and perhaps Malaysia.

As part of its shift to a professional services advisory firm, KPMG now
refers to consultative rather than consulting services. According to
Fuller, consultative services fall into five categories: strategy and
financial management (including value- based management); performance
improvement; package implementation like SAP; enabling technologies
such as mobile computing, networks, technology infrastructure and
client/server; and tax consulting services.

"One of our objectives worldwide is to substantially increase our rate
of penetration in our existing client base. We believe that we can
provide a substantial increased volume of service to clients . . . and
can provide better value to them as well."

The professional services advisory approach involves both an industry
and a specific functional focus. This is very different from
traditional cross-selling of consulting and audit services, Fuller
stressed. "Professional services advisory is where a traditional
service provider couples a better understanding of the client with
multi-disciplinary support to determine where the client has an
opportunity to improve profitability."

For example, two tax experts were involved in a recent business process
re-engineering and technology assignment for an insurance company and
produced savings for the client which would otherwise have been missed.

"Historically, I don't know if we would have found that. Or maybe the
client wouldn't have gone forward. But because we can approach this by
professional service, we can do it at a lower cost and higher value,"
Fuller said.

"We've not done away with functional specialities, we're just
approaching clients and the market differently," he added."I think this
is the model all clients will expect from their professional advisers
in future."

The multi-disciplinary industry-focused teams which KPMG has introduced
in the US and UK will continue to be rolled out around the globe with
the French, Dutch and German practices, among others, already moving in
that direction, he said.

KPMG also plans to continue expanding the types of services offered to
clients through alliances such as the one in 1995 with a US investment
firm to which KPMG licensed its name (KPMG BayMark). Other alliances
will be with academics and thought leaders - and in outsourcing, he
said.

In several countries, the firm is exploring outsourcing in the process
management area. But, Fuller said, there are no plans to follow EDS or
Andersen Consulting into the IT outsourcing arena.

UNITED KINGDOM:  50 JOBS LOST AT TOUCHE DUE TO D&T MERGER

Fifty consultants, mostly seniors, have lost their jobs at Touche Ross
in the run-up to the merger of the UK consulting practice with Deloitte
& Touche Consulting Group in the US.

Most of the cuts were in the information technology side of the
practice. They involved 26 consultants who were made redundant and 24
who were either redeployed in other parts of the firm or found
positions with clients. Touche now has 542 consultants, a reduction of
nearly 9 percent.

Four partners are also leaving the consultancy practice. One is Andrew
Davis, head of Touche Ross's IT consulting practice and 1992 president
of the Management Consultancies Association, who is retiring due to ill-
health. Three others will move to other parts of the firm, according to
John Everett, head of the UK practice.

No further cuts are expected, he added.

The cuts reflect a market shift away from high-level IT strategy work
and towards implementation assignments which require fewer seniors but
utilise a larger number of junior staff, Everett said.

They follow a major reorganisation within the consulting practice
earlier this year which saw the establishment of dedicated sales and
marketing teams in key industry sectors, and the creation of a separate
management advisory service (MAS) unit to provide management
consulting, tax and accounting advice to small and medium clients. The
MAS unit is now part of the audit side of the firm (MCI 73).

The cuts also pave the way for the proposed US-UK-Canada alliance which
will form the first leg of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International's
proposed global consulting firm (MCI 74). The practices have begun
working together at an operational level, although the legalities will
probably not be completed until June, Everett said.

A new management team comprising the heads of the UK, Canada and three
regional US consulting practices is being established to run the merged
operation, Everett said. Pat Laconto, head of the US consulting
practice, is expected to be the new chief executive.

AT&T HIRES THREE MORE TOP EXECUTIVES

AT&T Solutions has hired three more executives with strong consulting
backgrounds to round out the top tier of its consulting team. This now
includes the managing partners of each of its three business units
(consulting, systems integration and outsourcing), a global practice
director and a vice-president in charge of worldwide marketing.

In November, the group announced that it had filled all those posts
with the hiring of the following:

- Dick Anderson, managing partner for the systems integration practice.
Formerly chief technology officer for Kwasha Lipton, a benefits
consulting firm, and before that a principal at McKinsey.

- John Corsiglia, managing partner and global practice director.
Formerly president of BDM Technologies, the IT consulting and systems
integration subsidiary of BDM International, and a partner at McKinsey.

- Fred Lawrence, market management vice-president, responsible for
growth in vertical industry and geographical markets. Formerly a
private investor and a consulting managing partner with Arthur Andersen
& Co.

The other managing partners on the team are James Corey who runs
consulting and Rick Roscitt, who is in charge of the outsourcing
practice. They all work out of the group's Washington, DC,
headquarters.

The team has been charged by Solutions's president and chief executive
Victor Millar with carrying the group's aggressive focus on "electronic
commerce" into the crowded services marketplace and into the group's
second year.

"We think of electronic commerce as not just offering [access to] the
Internet, electronic invoices or a page on the World Wide Web, but
changing the rules of competition for our clients," Corey said. "All
industries will go through major strategic change enabled by electronic
commerce. That's really the scope of our Solutions business. . . Our
differentiator is to be bold and innovative in our thinking."

The new executives are not the group's only new hires. Despite the
recently-announced split of AT&T into three new companies and top-to-
bottom lay-offs and buy-outs, AT&T Solutions continues to grow. A
spokesman said the only impact the buy-outs might have on Solutions
would be in outsourcing, the largest practice within Solutions. A small
portion of this practice might be affected, he said.

At the end of 1995, AT&T Solutions had about 350 consultants on board
and anticipates hiring another 2,500 in 1996. The "business thinkers"
will come from outside the parent company but some of the technology
skills are already available within AT&T, Corey said. "The market
demand for this type of service is very powerful right now. We are
clearly resource-constrained, not demand-constrained," Corey said.

It is that combination of AT&T's technological and innovation skills
combined with the consultants' business expertise that will make AT&T
Solutions stand out in the market, he said.

CANADA:  MCI BOOSTS PROFILE WITH SHL ACQUISITION

With its acquisition of the Canadian information technology services
company, SHL Systemhouse, MCI Communications Corporation has boosted
its profile in the network management and outsourcing business, and
given the newly-combined organisation the tools to compete in the
booming services market.

The $1 billion deal, which was wrapped up in November, combines SHL
with MCI's Professional Services Organization in a new group called
"Enterprise Management Services". This will offer a single source for
communications, computing and consulting services. Details are still
being worked out, but essentially, EMS will design, operate and manage
communications and computing networks. MCI estimates the US market for
such services at $40 billion and growing at 20 percent per year.

"The whole idea is the single source provider for the ongoing
management of the computer network," said SHL spokesman Rick Gray.

SHL will continue to operate as a stand-alone company with its own
corporate identity within MCI, Gray said. It has 4,500 "consultants"
and had about $1 billion in revenue in 1995, Gray said. In addition to
joint offerings with MCI, SHL will continue to develop and manage
client/server solutions for companies moving away from centralised
mainframe systems.

SHL saw the deal as a good way to give it the size and scale needed to
grow in the IT services market. "It gives us further global reach,
because MCI is more expansive on a global basis," Gray said.

"It also gives us the marketing prowess and power of the MCI company.
They are a very savvy marketing company and certainly that will help to
push the services into the marketplace. And third, with a much larger
company like MCI, a company that has a lot of money in the bank, you
are fortifying your whole financial position. You make yourself a well-
heeled competitor with the deep pockets that help in this kind of
business."

MCI, one of the world's largest communications companies, reports $13
billion in annual revenue and a broad array of services, from long
distance to Internet access to outsourcing. Revenues for its
professional services unit were not available.

"As far as what MCI brings to this partnership, it is our data
capabilities which complement what SHL brings to the partnership in
terms of computing solutions," said MCI spokesman Jim Monroe. "The
expertise of our Professional Services Organization and the computing
expertise of SHL enables MCI and SHL to offer a desktop-to-desktop
management."

IBM FOCUSES ON NETWORK-CENTRIC COMPUTING

The new buzz word at International Business Machines is "network-
centric computing" and the struggling computer giant's consulting group
has become an integral part of that focus, according to the firm.

IBM chairman Louis Gerstner said in November that IBM is "betting its
future" on the popularity of network-based computer systems. He
believes IBM has the technological and consulting talent needed to help
it regain its stature in a rapidly-changing technological world.

IBM Consulting Group has been playing a key role in supporting the
execution of that strategy, said Joseph Movizzo, the group's general
manager.

"There were pieces of it that we had started, like business recovery
and the systems management business," he said. "So we had some
initiatives in place that now have to be expanded because they have
taken on a more critical role. The network- centric environment is
going to have a profound impact on the business. Any consulting firm
could say, `We've been doing some of that.' But now it becomes a
different way of thinking about [our] business."

The consulting group was formed in 1992 when IBM recruited Robert Howe
from Booz-Allen & Hamilton and Stephen Mucchetti from Coopers & Lybrand
to develop the new business (MCI 41). But the group has struggled as it
tried to find focus and collaborate with a broad spectrum of products-
oriented divisions.

Since then, it has become more integrated into the IBM framework and
now operates as part of IBM's complex matrix of products and services
divisions. In 1994, Mucchetti and Howe were named heads of industry
groups and Movizzo took over as general manager but in a redefined role
with diminished responsibilities (MCI 66).

Shifting these early founders into running businesses was not a matter
of sidelining them, but of putting them into "major roles
said.

"What people don't realize is what a dramatic change that was in our go-
to-market model," Movizzo said. "Part of this is getting people to
think in a non-hierarchical sense. What is a big job today? It is
defined by content and breadth, scope and size, rather than where it is
in an organisational chart. You can't see that any more in a matrixed
network organisation."

The consulting group is working closely with Lotus Development
Corporation, the software company that makes Notes and which IBM
acquired in July for $3.5 billion. Lotus' consulting capability
complements what the IBM Consulting Group is doing, Movizzo said. "For
us and their people on the consulting side it was a comfortable
relationship to begin with and now we are going to build on that."

In addition, some of IBM's consulting practices are deployed in ISSC,
an IBM subsidiary that does systems integration and outsourcing. "We
are also tightly linked from a development point of view in that the
consulting group was given responsibilities for developing and rolling
out common methodologies and tools across IBM, including ISSC," Movizzo
said.

By the end of 1995, the consulting group expected to have 2,800
professionals in 33 countries, including new offices in India and South
Africa. About 40 percent of the consultants are involved in industry
transformation/general business consulting, 30 percent do IT/networking
systems and the other 30 percent do object technology and data
modelling, he said.

And all three areas are reportedly growing, although IBM will not
release consulting-specific numbers. In 1993 and 1994, the group
claimed 35 percent growth, and Movizzo said the group continued to grow
at 25 percent to 35 percent in 1995. "Of course, the bigger we get, the
harder it is to maintain that percentage," he said."But . . . on an
ongoing basis, I'd like to keep it there. I don't see any limits to
that, interestingly enough, as I look forward."

UNITED KINGDOM:  ARTHUR ANDERSEN ACQUIRES DOCTUS CONSULTANCY

Arthur Andersen has acquired Chester-based management consultancy,
Doctus, in a deal which sees Denis Mahoney, Doctus' managing director,
join the Andersen practice as a partner.

The acquisition is part of a growing shift by accountants Arthur
Andersen into the management consulting arena usually associated with
its sister firm, Andersen Consulting.

Doctus is a small multi-disciplinary consultancy with around 15
consultants specialising in strategy, change management and
implementing improved working practices and business processes.
Clients include British Airways and British Nuclear Fuels.

Founded in 1976, the firm has had a chequered history.  It became a
publicly quoted company in 1986 and was subsequently acquired by a
larger public limited company which retained the Doctus name for its
marketing and business services activities.  When that group collapsed
in 1991, Doctus' management consulting operation was bought by CRT, the
training and recruitment group.

In 1993, however, CRT decided to pull out of management consulting
after a substantial decline in the market for Doctus' services, with
the business losing #0.7 million ($1.09 million) in the first half of
1993.  Mahoney led a magement buy-out and Doctus Consulting Europe, as
it was then known, began scaling back its European activities (MCI 54).

Both AA and Doctus declined to discuss details of the acquisition, but
Andersen said it involved a small payment for the tangible assets of
the business, plus partnership for Mahoney.  Nothing was paid for
goodwill.

"Doctus has an established track record in securing long-term profit
performance improvements with clients throughout the UK utilities,
aerospace and airlines industries.  Andersen's extensive worldwide
reach will provide Docuts with a vital edge," Mahoney said.

FEACO REPORTS FALL IN 1994 REVENUES

Management consulting revenues fell by more than 9 percent in 1994
among members of FEACO, the European federation of management
consulting associations. Revenue per consultant also decreased although
the firms appeared to have hired more consultants.

The information is contained in FEACO's annual survey released in
December 1995. It is based on responses from 17 of the 25 national
associations which comprise the federation. The 17 associations
represent 1,088 consulting firms employing 31,257 consultants. FEACO
members have an estimated 34 percent share of the total consulting
market in Europe.

Combined income for these firms was ECU4.55 billion ($5.9 billion) in
1994, almost the same as in 1993. Management consulting fees, however,
fell to ECU3.89 billion from ECU4.28 billion, the previous year.

At the same time, revenues from other sources such as software sales
and interim management increased. In some countries, notably the
Netherlands, these account for more than half of consulting firms'
revenues.

The number of consultants employed by the firms grew by 9.4 percent but
average revenue per consultant fell by 17 percent to ECU124,867,
possibly reflecting the departure of senior consultants and their
replacement by inexperienced graduates.

It should be borne in mind, however, that the members of the national
associations vary considerably, ranging in size from firms of less than
ten consultants to those employing several hundred. Also, many
international consultancies do not join national associations and are
therefore not reflected in the figures.

Despite widespread discussion of globalisation, it would seem - based
on FEACO's data - that management consulting is becoming an
increasingly national activity. Domestic business accounted for 88.5
percent of FEACO members' turnover, a slight increase over the previous
year. But this is a somewhat misleading statistic, reflecting in part
which office sends out the invoice on a cross-border assignment, not
who is doing the actual work.

Countries with the highest share of management consulting relative to
gross national product are Switzerland (0.35 percent), Germany (0.32
percent) and the Netherlands (0.30 percent).

Overall, information technology and systems work increased by 51.7
percent, finance and administration grew by 15 percent and human
resources jumped by 16 percent. Demand for other types of consulting
work declined.

THE NETHERLANDS:  C&L CONSIDERS MOVE TO LIMITED LIABILITY STATUS

Coopers & Lybrand, the third-largest firm in the Netherlands, is
considering a move to limited liability status as a way of protecting
itself against litigation.

A decision to draw up a plan for incorporation was taken at a partners
meeting in September, but the final proposal is unlikely to be put to a
partnership vote before next summer, said Louk Stumpel, C&L's head of
marketing and communications. The firm is looking at incorporating all
of its operations in the Netherlands - consulting, accounting and tax,
he added.

If the plan goes ahead, C&L would be the second Big Six firm in the
Netherlands to become a limited liability company or NV. KPMG Klynveld
adopted NV status on January 1 1995, although two of its Dutch member
firms, actuarial consultancy Brans & Co and tax law firm KPMG Meijburg,
opted out of the move (MCI 65). The other Big Six have seemed reluctant
to consider incorporation.

Turnover in C&L's management consulting operations was relatively flat
in 1994, growing by less than 3 percent to DFLl84.3 million ($52.6
million). Firm-wide, revenues slipped by 2.1 percent to DFL659 million
although C&L recorded a profit of DFL26.9 million, an increase of 18.5
percent over 1993. The firm employed an average of 255 consultants in
1994.

DEPARTURES FROM GEMINI CONSULTING

Gemini Consulting has revised the number of US consultants let go in
two rounds of job cuts earlier this year (MCI 74,71). The firm now says
only 150 were fired, not the 270 previously announced. However, the
firm acknowledged that the total number of consultants for 1995 will
average 1,400, compared with 1,700 in 1994. The difference is due to
attrition and some terminations in Europe over performance issues, a
spokesperson explained.

RESULTS FROM DTTI AND E&Y

Consulting drove growth at both Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International
and Ernst & Young in 1995. Worldwide fee income at DTTI rose 14.4
percent to $5.95 billion in the year to August 30. The firm did not
provide a fee split but said an expansion into emerging markets and the
acquisition of information technology firm ICS were among the factors
behind a record increase in revenues in fiscal 1995.

Ernst & Young reported record worldwide revenues of $6.87 billion for
the fiscal year ended September 30. This was a 14 percent increase over
the prior year and higher than its worldwide growth rate for the
previous four years combined. The firm reported"strong momentum" in
management consulting but did not provide worldwide consulting
revenues.

In the US, E&Y's revenues were up 16.9 percent to $2.97 billion, more
than double the increase in fiscal 1994. Management consulting grew by
48.2 percent in the US, and health care consulting by 42.2 percent, US
chairman Philip Laskawy said. Total US consulting revenues increased by
36 percent.

IRISH CONSULTANTS' FOREIGN EARNINGS

Consultants in Ireland are increasingly looking to overseas projects to
boost fee income. According to the Institute of Management Consultants
in Ireland (IMCI), foreign earnings of member firms trebled to Ir#38.21
million ($61.53 million) in the last six years. A large portion of that
was earned by the international consulting arms of the two leading
banks and the state-owned electricity company. Total revenue earned by
Irish consultants in 1993 was estimated at Ir#75 million by the IMCI.

BRANDING - THE ULTIMATE GOAL

From the old-fashioned Coca-Cola bottle to American Express' "Accepted
Worldwide" message, every company wants a consistent image that builds
brand loyalty and consumer confidence. So, too, do consultants, as
Karin Ronnow finds out

Branding, as it is dubbed by the marketing gurus, has taken on
increasing importance in the hyper-competitive, global consulting
marketplace. Many of the international consulting firms have invested
in branding over the years, but those that ignored it are now finding
that it has merit.

Branding takes two forms - the "message" about what the firm is, and
how that plays out in a physical "look" and "feel". For consulting
firms, the message has always been the primary emphasis. But, as firms
become more global, they are finding that a universal "look" is equally
important.

"Branding is something that creates loyalty, premium pricing potential
and better distribution and market acceptance," said Allan Steinmetz,
Arthur D Little's senior vice-president and corporate director of
marketing.

"That's why companies invest so much in it. Setting standards with
regard to corporate identity, the look and feel, from business cards to
brochures to presentation styles . . . It is a common denominator that
creates an asset value for a corporation."

Bain, for example, is taking a new look at branding. The firm has
relied heavily on its 23-year history on face-to-face contact to
communicate its message of "results". Bain doesn't advertise, so client
contacts are the only opportunity to "describe what we do, how we do it
and how it is a different product or process than our major
competitors", Bain director David Bechoffer said.

But in the past year it has become clear that while Bain is consistent
in "cross-office" delivery, the firm has not always looked like it
delivered that consistency, Bechoffer said. "We have grown incredibly
quickly over the past three or four years and we didn't all `look' the
same," Bechoffer said. "So we went through a major exercise to develop
a standards log and we will now have material that will be top-to-
bottom consistent to reinforce the strength of what we say, from
letterhead to business cards. So when we have people from five offices
working on a project, the clients see one firm and not five offices.
And that does mean something in the long run."

Brand is "a very deep discussion for a firm", said Kathleen Reichert,
vice-president of marketing and communication for AT Kearney.

The recent acquisition of AT Kearney by Electronic Data Systems - two
markedly different firms - creates a challenge for Reichert, who must
define how the expanded Kearney looks and communicates.

In its former incarnation, AT Kearney had a definite, conservative
look, best defined by the "Kearney grey", which permeated the firm,
from literature to the walls of its downtown Chicago headquarters. EDS
has presented a more outgoing, innovative image.

"We are still in the process of looking at how we want to brand the new
AT Kearney," she said. "At this point, we want to retain the AT Kearney
logo, which we think provides continuity and allows us to draw from
some of AT Kearney's strengths and traditions.

"We are reviewing the introduction of colour, the use of visuals that
express the excitement, change and some of the important strategic
thrusts we hope to be undertaking over the next three- year period."

Brand defines the firm to the outside world but also helps build a
culture internally. Arthur D Little sees its brand largely as its
"personality", which the firm defines as "confident, aggressive, easy
to work with, learning with clients side by side, in conjunction with
deep knowledge and experience in three distinct lines of business",
ADL's Steinmetz said. Consultants are charged with conveying that
message in any client contact.

But visually conveying the message is important too, and ADL has a
three-ring binder of "Corporate Graphic Standards", which details the
size, shape and look of all corporate brochures, biography sheets, fact
and office lists, corporate statements, letterhead, business cards and
mailing labels. The colour and placement of the ADL logo on a page, the
size of the font, and full-length and abbreviated versions of ADL's
identity statements are all spelled out to ensure continuity around the
world.

"We went through an exhaustive brand identity review about eight years
ago and it was designed to give us a global, more contemporary feel
about who we were," Steinmetz said. "We hired an outside identity
consulting firm that specialises in this area and this is what they
recommended. We conducted client research and this is the one theme
most reflective of what we wanted to be known for."

A distinct personality has added importance for Andersen Consulting.
Along with selling itself, AC must also distinguish its services from
those of its sister firm, Arthur Andersen, which sells some consulting
services as well as tax and auditing. AC stresses that it offers
different services and that its clients are dissimilar.

"The biggest problem is perception," AC partner Jim Murphy said.
"Andersen Consulting is only six years old . . . so we continue to work
on setting up separate brands. There are parts of it that are the same -
 integrity, professionalism. But in the audit and tax business, you
need a heavy emphasis on conservative steadiness. In our business, you
need an emphasis on creativity, innovation, sharing risks. It's a whole
different personality, a whole different brand."

For itself, AC stresses its commitment to being a global firm. And,
while it has invested in consistent visual messages, the idea of "the
message" is emphasised to new hires from their first day on the job.

"Most important is something that we don't own, our clients own, it's
in their head, and that is our promise to them as an organisation,"
Murphy said."It comes to life not only in advertising, literature and
signage, but how people act on the job, how we sell, what kind of
clients we have, what we do. All of this has to be part of the built-in
culture. It comes out of our training, the acculturation process. The
idea of what Andersen Consulting stands for as a brand is put in front
of all our employees."

HIGHLIGHTS OF 1995

Mergers, acquisitions and lawsuits characterised the consulting
industry in 1995. The year saw the biggest ever acquisition of one
consulting firm by another, as well as the largest legal action to be
mounted against a consultant. William Gleeson looks back at the major
news stories

JANUARY

The year started with the theme "out with the old and in with the new".
KPMG Switzerland swept away its old management team, replacing it with
new faces in the boardroom. The changes came after two years of flat
growth at the firm. Jacob Baer took over as head of a four-person
management committee following the departure of Hugh Mathews, who was
formerly joint managing partner with Baer.

Ernst & Young found itself on the wrong end of the first writ of the
year over a claim for several million pounds from North West Thames
Regional Health Authority in the UK. The dispute centred on E&Y's
alleged failure to meet a deadline for the completion of a consultancy
project to give the authority a new payroll system and financial
systems mainframe.

FEBRUARY

The year was punctuated by job loss announcements. One of the earliest
was Ernst & Young's disclosure of changes to its US actuarial and
special services practices.

The actuarial, benefits and compensation unit was renamed "human
resources" and reorganised into 11 locations, down from 20. At the same
time, E&Y's mergers, acquisitions, reorganisations and insolvency
practice was renamed "financial advisory services" and concentrated at
19 locations. As a result of the changes, around 100 people left the
firm.

CSC continued its expansion in Europe with the acquisition of German
information technology consulting firm, Ploenzke. At the same time, CSC
acquired SODI, the small international consulting arm of Groupe
Ouroumoff in France. This followed the acquisition of Ouroumoff
Consultants in 1994.

George Cox, former chairman of P-E International, became the UK chief
executive of Unisys. His hiring was the latest in a line of about 70
high flying consultants taken on at the systems firm.

MARCH

Another major theme during the year was the shift to "global"
consulting practices. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International led the
pack with its announced plans for a global practice, but DTTI denied it
would split consulting from audit and tax as Arthur Andersen and
Andersen Consulting had done in 1989. (Further details emerged as the
year progressed).

The century old names of "Peat" and "Marwick" officially disappeared
when KPMG Peat Marwick in the UK announced that as part of its
incorporation plans, the firm was renaming itself KPMG. In the US,
Deloitte and Touche acquired the Canadian firm, International
Consulting Solutions, a SAP software implementation company. The new
business was called ICS Deloitte, employing 700 professionals.

Victor Millar resigned as head of Unisys Worldwide Information Services
to run a new consulting unit at AT&T, the US telecommunications
company. The move by the communications giant into the crowded
consulting market created yet another consulting, systems integration
and outsourcing competitor for the big international consulting firms -
and pointed up the value of consulting in selling other information
technology services.

The consultancy profession in the UK voiced its disapproval of a
government scheme to set up a register of consultants to assist
companies in choosing suitable advisers. The consultants argued that
the scheme was too expensive and bureaucratic and would jeopardise
client confidentiality.

APRIL

Ernst & Young and mid-tier US accounting and consulting firm Kenneth
Leventhal, which specialises in real estate work, announced a merger.
Leventhal was formerly the US member firm of CKL International, the
15th-largest international accounting and consulting network.

Rumours emerged that EDS was set to make a bid for AT Kearney but this
was strongly denied by both firms. "We have no need or desire to sell
the firm," said Kearney's chief executive Fred Steingraber. Meanwhile,
it emerged that EDS's fledgling management consulting arm had a $22
million loss in 1994 on revenues estimated by MCI at $180 million. The
firm attributed the losses to start-up costs.

Andersen Consulting, on the other hand, reported worldwide revenue up
20 percent to $3.45 billion.

MAY

In what appeared to be the largest lawsuit to date against a consulting
firm, UOP, an Illinois-based engineering company, filed a $100 million
suit against Andersen Consulting, alleging fraud, incompetence and
negligence.

It was the latest in a string of lawsuits against consultants and
underscored that consultancies are as much at risk from legal actions
for negligence as the accounting firms. UOP, which licenses petroleum
and gas processing technologies, claimed that Andersen bungled the
development of two computer systems intended to streamline the
preparation of engineering specifications and project cost estimates.

Ernst & Young's London practice announced plans for a radical
restructuring of part of its operations along multi-disciplinary lines.
Consultants, auditors and tax advisers were grouped together to serve
specific market sectors: financial services, media and resources,
industrial and consumer services and owner- managed businesses. About
90 of the 400 UK consultants were deployed in the new groups.

Proudfoot also announced plans to change the way it does things. The
firm said it would revamp its product, improve its internal operations
and launch its first ever global marketing drive. It also announced
results showing the severest drop in revenues in its history for its
core productivity services in Europe. Overall, turnover plummeted 24
percent to #106 million ($165.6 million). Some 150 jobs had been shed
in the year to March, bringing the total workforce to 700.

Mercer Management Consulting expanded its presence in Europe by
acquiring MID, a mid-sized French strategy firm, and announcing plans
to open an office in Madrid. The acquisition boosted the number of
Mercer consultants in Europe to 250, up from 70 two years ago.

JUNE

More writs, this time in Australia where Price Waterhouse Urwick was
sued for the largest claim for damages brought against a firm of
management consultants in that country. The firm was sued for $A13
million ($9.8 million) by a failed museum venture and its developer,
for engaging in alleged misleading and deceptive conduct and for breach
of contract. The claim centred on a report predicting the likely number
of visitors to the museum.

The month saw also more bad news for PW, this time in Canada. The firm
announced the closure of its Quebec IT office due to major cutbacks in
consulting work from the Quebec Government.

OC&C, the former strategic consulting arm of Coopers & Lybrand, said it
planned to establish a base in North America and Germany within a year
as part of an international growth strategy. The firm, which has
offices in London, Paris and Rotterdam, left C&L in April.

JULY

After a series of on-again, off-again talks, EDS acquired AT Kearney to
create a $550 million business with more than 2,300 consultants. It was
the first significant move by an IT firm into the upper echelon of
consulting leagues.

The deal signalled the growing polarisation between the so-called super
providers of integrated consulting services and the rest of the pack.
EDS paid $300 million in cash. Additionally, to retain key staff, some
200 Kearney executives received about 7 million shares of class E
General Motors stock, vested over ten years. The GME stock tracks EDS
business and was valued at $296 million.

There was bad news at Gemini Consulting which laid off some 170 staff -
8 percent of its worldwide employees (since revised, see page 6). Most
of the lay-offs were in the US. The cuts came amid rumours of senior
level disagreements within the firm and the abrupt departure of the
former chairman and chief executive David Teiger.

AUGUST/SEPTEMBER

Andersen Consulting started litigation proceedings against rival
consulting firm, American Management Systems, alleging copyright
infringement, breach of contract and intentional interference with
Andersen's business opportunities. Andersen contended that AMS copied
AC's proprietary tax administration system design and demanded $20
million in lost profits and damages.

Another firm revealed some of its globalisation plans. Ernst & Young
replaced its European Consulting Group with a new legal entity, Global
Client Consulting, in a move towards developing a global consulting
practice. The new group will service major clients in large-scale,
multi-year contracts.

General Motors announced plans to spin off EDS in a move designed to
allow EDS to pursue its strategic objectives more effectively. CSC
Index pulled out of Korea just months after closing its Japan operation
acknowledging a "substantial" loss on its Asia venture. And Coopers &
Lybrand agreed to pay the state of Arizona $750,000 after a long-
running investigation into alleged bidding improprieties in the award
of a consulting contract. C&L denied any wrongdoing.

Most of KPMG's consultants in Adelaide defected to Coopers & Lybrand.
The three partners who defected said KPMG's federated organisational
structure in Australia - where each state has its own management
structure and reporting lines - was an obstacle to building a national
practice in Australia.

OCTOBER

American Management Systems struck back in the copyright dispute with
Andersen Consulting. AMS filed a counter lawsuit, charging defamation
and accusing Andersen of trying to damage AMS's business prospects and
reputation. According to AMS, Andersen contacted AMS clients claiming
ownership of the tax system design which AMS was using. A New York
district court denied Andersen's request for an injunction to prevent
AMS from using the disputed tax system design.

NOVEMBER

More job losses. Gemini Consulting laid-off 100 employees in the second
round of redundancies at the firm in the year. The cuts followed months
of turmoil at the firm, including the sudden departure of new chief
executive, Dan Valentino, and a slide in US revenues.

Yet another in a long line of reorganisations at Proudfoot, the
publicly-quoted consultancy which has seen its revenues and share price
dwindle in recent years. This time, the company announced plans to
revamp its management structure in the US, dramatically scale back its
Mexico operations and centralise control over its business development
and operational activities. Malcolm Hughes, the chief executive
appointed in October 1994, said"this is my one and only restructuring.
It is what I was brought in to do. I think it will result in a
turnaround fairly quickly."

Deloitte and Touche in the US and Touche Ross in the UK said they were
on the brink of forming a transatlantic alliance of their consulting
practices. The move follows the creation of Deloitte & Touche
Consulting Group in the US as a separate division of the US firm.

Andersen Consulting announced plans to make a physical break with
Arthur Andersen by leaving the worldwide headquarters of the firm in
Chicago. The firms legally split in 1989. Some observers say the move
was inspired by Andersen Consulting's desire to distance itself from
Arthur Andersen, the accounting part of the firm, as AA attempts to
develop its own consulting practice.

DECEMBER

Amdahl came out as victor in the battle for Canadian technology
services company, DMR, after outbidding its two rivals, IBM Canada and
BDM International of the US. The deal created another giant in the
growing services and solutions marketplace, which is increasingly
posing a threat to the traditional management consultancies.

PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

Managing change may be the core activity of a consultant's work, but
observing change is also part of the job. Ed Hendricks, who retires as
president of ACME, the US-based association of management consulting
firms, at the end of December, looks back on his years with the
association

In the nearly 17 years that I have been on the staff of ACME, I have
had the benefit of an unparalleled overview of the worldwide consulting
marketplace. To say that there have been significant changes in the
profession over those years would be a gross understatement. And, any
attempt to capture all of those changes would be futile. However, as I
prepare to leave the association at the end of 1995, I did want to
share some of my observations.

The late 1970s and early 1980s were the end of the era of the big name
owner/founder firms. These were the days of the Dick Pagets and Carl
Sloanes (among others) who, by force of their personalities, maintained
the image of consulting as a "gentlemen's club".

There was a desire among the firms to share information and to help
each other out. As Carl Sloane put it at an ACME meeting, "You do good
work we all benefit, you do bad work we all suffer." There was also a
strong belief in professionalism, translated into standards of
practice, which had the effect of limiting competition while fostering
the development of personal relationships and even friendships among
the heads of firms.

By the 1980s, different types of organisations began to enter the
consulting arena. Driven by the "Big Eight" accounting firms' move into
consulting in a concerted way, marketing activities were increased, and
some practitioners even began to use the word "sell" in the same
sentence as "consulting services", much to the chagrin of the purists.

Bigness and one-stop shopping came into vogue and acquisitions and
mergers became the norm. Many of the founders/owners took this
opportunity to capitalise on their investments, and their firms were
acquired by larger entities. The resulting mega-firms required a
different type of management structure, and a"revolving door" in the
chief executive's position was not unusual.

Relationships became more professional than personal in nature,
resulting in some hesitancy in sharing information.

A slowdown in overall growth in the early 1990s caused many consulting
firms to increase their marketing efforts and to experiment with the
use of advertising and other ways to differentiate themselves from the
competition. And, firms began to look for other services to provide, in
addition to consulting advice.

Training programmes, software and outsourcing activities became common
ancillary services offered by consulting firms. As clients began to
increasingly demand experienced consultants to work on their projects,
consulting firms found themselves caught in a price compression
situation. In many cases, profits suffered and competition increased.

Throughout the early and mid-1990s, consulting firms found themselves
under increasing pressure from a variety of sources. Outplaced
executives from client companies formed their own consulting firms and
competed for the work they had previously contracted out. Clients began
to demand that consulting firms share the risk of change with them, and
contingency fees, value added bonus plans, and other billing
arrangements based on the successful implementation of the consultant's
recommendations became more common.

Technology became an important part of almost every consulting
assignment. As a result, consulting firms either began or increased
spending on their own technological infrastructure. No longer was the
capital of a consulting firm to be found only in its people.

Running a consulting firm became a very expensive proposition. Big
corporations like IBM and EDS saw consulting as a way of expanding
their product and service offerings and explored different ways of
entering the field. Competition for senior level staff accelerated and
executive search firms were kept busy by consulting firms.

Experimentation with management structures and delivery mechanisms were
additional challenges confronting consulting firms in the 1990s. Some
firms chose to centralise consulting services under one key executive.
Others chose to segment by industry, service offering or geography, and
yet more developed a hybrid of styles.

Despite the challenges of the mid-1990s, it has been a boom time for
most firms. Record revenues have been reported by many firms, and the
short-term future seems to be bright. But if history is any predictor,
the pendulum will shift again!

So what do I see for the future?

For one thing, I foresee additional mergers between some quite large
firms with others being acquired by so-called non- traditional
competitors. I would not be surprised to see consulting operations
being spun-off to become publicly-held companies through stock
offerings.

Traditional partnerships are going to find it increasingly difficult to
derive the financing for very large outsourcing opportunities and
technological requirements.

Lawsuits against consulting firms can also not be far off as clients
demand higher levels of success in project implementation.

And, consulting firms are going to have to devise new ways of dealing
with a diverse workforce that is more concerned with lifestyle issues
and may not be willing to accept the heavy travel schedules and
workload pressures of their predecessors.

Although I am leaving ACME, I do so with a great deal of respect for
our profession. Consultants are truly agents of change. As such, they
carry a great burden to operate at the very highest standards of
integrity. Almost without exception, the consultants I have met have
borne that burden with dignity.

Editor's Note: Ed plans to become a professional speaker and consultant
to consulting firms. He can be contacted through ACME at 1-212-697
9693.

SWITZERLAND: A SOPHISTICATED MARKET

The competitive Swiss consulting market is attracting international
firms while local consultancies are starting to work outside
Switzerland. Sandra Burke reports

For its size, the Swiss consulting market is highly sophisticated.
Switzerland has more consultants per head of population than any other
country, reflecting in part the large number of Swiss multinational
corporations and the foreign multinationals with European headquarters
in Switzerland, all seeking top class advice.

As a result, many of the international consultancies and IT providers
have opened offices. They share the market with a number of independent
mid-sized local firms and a large collection of sole practitioners. The
latest arrivals in 1995 included Bossard Consultants and American
Management Systems. Gemini Consulting established a presence in 1994.

Despite the attractions, however, the Swiss market has some inherent
problems. Fee rates are up to 20 percent higher than in neighbouring
countries. This, together with a strong Swiss franc, has caused
problems for some consultants as clients turn to cheaper German
consultancies, or seek to pay in deutschmarks or dollars.

Other constraints have been the lingering effects of the recession, a
small hiring pool, and the moves by many Swiss firms to relocate in
cheaper countries, thus obviating the need for consultants. Foreign
consultants with lower pricing structures are also entering the Swiss
market, forcing local players to discount their rates. This is
especially true in delivery areas such as SAP, according to consultants
interviewed by MCI.

Not all consultancies, however, have been affected by these trends. The
strategy houses are doing well, reflecting the desire of major Swiss
multinationals for international know-how, regardless of price.

Altogether, the size of the Swiss consulting market is estimated at
SKr500 million ($439 million) to SKr600 million. But the market is
highly fragmented. Turnover among the top 25 firms totalled SKr344.2
million in 1994. But the three leading firms - McKinsey, Coopers &
Lybrand and CSC - held about 20 percent of the market.

Consultants interviewed estimated overall market growth in 1995 at
between 5 percent and 10 percent.

Performance in 1994 varied widely among the firms. The strategy houses,
in particular, did well, reflecting the desire of major Swiss
multinationals for international know-how, regardless of price.

Switzerland is an "extremely attractive" market for Bain, said managing
director Janet Voute-Allen. "I think what's unique to Switzerland is
that the top companies are highly international. The top 20 make a very
small percentage of their sales in Switzerland. So, they require [a
consultancy] with an international office network," she said.

Bain has 30 consultants working in Switzerland, of which 13 are based
there. The firm plans to double its local staff so assignments can be
staffed locally. The office was established in 1990 and has seen 100
percent growth per annum in the last three years, Voute-Allen said.

In Switzerland, Bain is working in the retail, pharmaceutical, high
tech, construction and consumer goods sectors, but not, surprisingly,
in financial services although the firm is in discussions on some
assignments now.

"We see a shift away from looking inside at costs and organisation and
looking out at growth strategies. That's good for companies and good
for us," Voute-Allen said. "Cost optimisation is essential and must
continue. But it's not everything."

At Coopers & Lybrand, consulting turnover doubled over the last four
years and the firm expects growth of 18 percent to 20 percent in 1995,
said Tony Haas, managing partner. Cross-border work is still a small
portion of C&L's consulting business in Switzerland but will form a
larger part in future, especially on big projects, Haas said.
Currently, the Swiss firm is working closely with its sister firm in
Germany.

The firm is well placed in the telecommunications, public sector and
health care sector, but less strong in financial services in part
because C&L was owned by Swiss Bank Corporation until 1991, Haas said.
"We are still a little bit behind [in financial services] but growing,"
Haas said.

KPMG reorganised its operations in 1994 after two years of flat growth
(MCI 65). As a result, there was a "reduction in volume" in 1994 over
1993, said Bruce Mathers, partner in charge of management consulting.
Demand was higher in 1995 and the firm was hoping for a 15 percent
growth in the consulting practice, Mathers said.

As part of the reorganisation, KPMG created separate consulting groups
in banking, insurance, consulting to central and eastern Europe,
standard software implementation (predominantly SAP), IT consulting
(which offers advice on hardware and software selection) and corporate
finance.

"We are organised into smallish groups with a very clear focus on each.
That was a conscious change. We used to have everyone in one management
consulting pot. We have split it down to make sure development and
marketing activities are more focused," Mathers said.

Plans to create a banking industry group which would combine audit, tax
and consulting had to be shelved after the Federal Banking Commission
expressed reservations, he said.

The firm has also postponed plans to create other industry specific
groups like those in the UK and US. "They are large enough to split
into industry specific groups. For us, that is still a couple of years
down the road in terms of allocating consultants to particular
industries," Mathers said.

In Switzerland, KPMG is doing particularly well in corporate finance
and corporate recovery work as well as in SAP and business process re-
engineering, Mathers said. "What is limiting our growth is the
availability of qualified personnel," he added.

Deloitte & Touche, which has the smallest consulting practice of any of
the Big Six firms in Switzerland, reported record growth in 1994
following a relaunch of the consulting operation. This was achieved in
part by hiring a team from a rival Big Six firm.

"Consulting firms in Switzerland have always had cyclic expansion and
contraction," said Daniel Meister, head of D&T's Swiss consulting
practice. "The Swiss firm made a decision [to expand consulting]
because they felt and still feel that besides the audit potential to
grow - and they see less opportunity in that area - they realise they
need a well- managed consulting group to support them in keeping
clients and adding value to clients."

The 1995 acquisition of Canadian SAP specialists ICS - which had an
operation in Basel - also contributed to growth, Meister said. D&T has
targeted the health care, pharmaceuticals, financial services and
logistics/distribution sectors, he said. With ICS primarily involved in
pharmaceuticals in Switzerland, "this has been a boost to our
opportunities from a re-engineering perspective", Meister said.

D&T is also considering supplementing its SAP services with Oracle
business application skills. It is likely to retain its niche training
services in Word, Excel and other packages. "In Switzerland, PC
training has always been important. It's never grown a lot but it has
added some volume. I don't see it as strategic, but it is profitable,"
Meister said.

Among the Swiss firms, revenues were flat at ICME in 1994 compared with
1993, according to partner Gian Saratz, although the firm showed a 7
percent increase when its international revenue was taken into account.
ICME offers a range of general consulting services and has subsidiaries
in France and Germany. About half the clients are in banking, insurance
and telecommunications with the rest in the manufacturing, chemical and
pharmaceutical sectors.

Saratz blamed the recession and the firm's international focus for its
lack-lustre performance in Switzerland. "The market has become much
tougher. Also, we put our strength quite a bit abroad to support our
other companies so we neglected Switzerland a bit."

Helbling Management Consulting reported revenues of SKr11 million in
1994 and expects to increase that to SKr13 million in 1995, according
to Reto Muller, managing director. In addition, the firm will have SKr3
million from its German operation.

Muller attributed the increase to a gain in market share at the expense
of smaller Swiss consultancies. "Firms with less than SKr10 million
face difficulties," he noted. His firm, which provides strategy
consulting and counts McKinsey and The Boston Consulting Group among
its competitors, also benefits from its lower fee structure compared to
the bigger strategy firms.

"We have lower rates. Our daily fees are on average SKr2,700 [compared
to SKr4,000 to SKr5,000 per day at other strategy firms]. So we are
still very competitive compared to the big ones. We won three contracts
against McKinsey and BCG in Germany and Switzerland this year. We
compete in certain areas such as corporate restructuring, time-based
management . . . We do not compete in international market studies."

Helbling's target clients are companies with annual turnover of SKr20
million to SKr1 billion, Muller added. In addition to the management
consulting business, the Helbling Group has four other subsidiaries: a
mergers and acquisitions unit; a product design and automation unit
comprising 120 professionals, mainly engineers; an EDP company
specialising in computer-aided design software for engineers; and an
environmental unit, Muller said.

"We expect next year a lot of assignments in financial and corporate
restructuring and also a lot of profit improvement and turnaround
assignments. Also, new public management. There is an increasing demand
for those types of services," he said.

SCG St. Gallen Consulting Group estimates 1995 Swiss revenues at
SKr10.8 million, up 20 percent over 1994. Founded in 1984, the firm has
retained its close ties with the University of St. Gallen. In addition
to its headquarters in the town of St. Gallen near the German border,
the firm has an office near Geneva in the French- speaking part of
Switzerland along with offices in Frankfurt, Leipzig and London. Total
revenue was SKr25.7 million in 1994, nearly half of which was derived
in Switzerland. SCG is fully independent and partner-owned.

"We've been international from the beginning because the founders had
worked internationally. Switzerland being a small country, for growth
to be obtained, it is necessary to grow internationally. If you were
only working in Switzerland, growth would be limited," said consultant
Peter Fanconi.

The firm specialises in strategy but also in organisation and corporate
development, management systems, marketing and sales, business re-
engineering and human resources (especially management and leadership).

SCG's clients are primarily in the financial services and retail
sectors but the firm is increasingly working in the public sector and
industry (especially energy, IT and telecommunications).

At TC Team Consult, revenues were flat in 1994. The firm specialises in
four sectors: police and security, family-owned companies, the public
sector and the postal services. The Swiss holding company owns all of
the Swiss practice plus a 5 percent to 10 percent stake in Team
Consult's subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria.

Nearly three years ago, Bossard Consultants of France took a 20 percent
stake in Team Consult (MCI 45) with plans to boost that to 51 percent
and use TC to build a Swiss business. That appears not to have
progressed. Bossard retains the 20 percent ownership but the firms do
not work closely together and Bossard has recently opened its own
office in Zurich. Currently, Bossard has two people in Switzerland,
although up to 20 consultants from Bossard's French office have been
working in the French-speaking part of the country. The firm is seeking
a Swiss partner, said Hans-Joachim Diedenhofen, partner in charge of
the Swiss operation.

Other Swiss firms include Hayek Engineering with estimated revenues of
SKr12.5 million; Gherzi which specialises in the textiles sector and
has estimated income of SKr18.6 million; APP Informatik which is
primarily involved in information technology; BSG in St. Gallen which
offers strategy, organisational and IT consulting; Abegglen & Partners
which provides general management consulting to the services sector
including retail and telecommunications; and Management Zentrum, also
in St. Gallen.

Trends elsewhere are also manifest in Switzerland but with some
differences. Recruitment, for example, can be tougher in Switzerland
than elsewhere due to the country's small population and relatively
large consulting market resulting in a much smaller pool of potential
recruits. Tough laws on foreign workers also make hiring consultants
from elsewhere a challenge.

Globalisation has not hit the local Swiss firms, but many are already
working outside Switzerland, primarily in Germany.

"On a Swiss base, we are a large company. On a European scale, we are
in the problem field," said Saratz of ICME. "We are trying to grow
either by ourselves or by alliances." Besides Switzerland, ICME is
concentrating on the French, German and Austrian markets. The firm is
also doing work in Spain and Italy through a local partner, albeit
mainly for Swiss, French and German clients, he said.

Helbling opened its first German office four years ago and now has
small bases in Dusseldorf, Stuttgart and Munich. After building up the
German practice, the firm plans to expand into other countries, Muller
said.

Looking ahead, consultants anticipate increased fee pressure and a
shake-out among the mid-sized firms. "Fees are always a topic,"
observed KPMG's Mathers. "You certainly have to be very competitive."

One company, Stiftung BWI, which was associated with the technical
university in Zurich, announced in November that it would cease its
consulting operations. The firm's 1994 turnover was SKr8.1 million,
down 4.7 percent over the previous year, according to Klaus Wernihk,
the interim director who is overseeing BWI's wind-up.

The institute had 40 consultants and offered a range of general
services. Fee rates were reportedly lower than at competing small and
medium Swiss firms in part because BWI could draw on students to
conduct some of its economic studies.

But BWI, which was created before the advent of specialty consulting
and international competition, had outlived its time, Wernihk said.
Some of its core activities may be spun off through management buy-
outs, he added.

Perhaps the greatest challenge facing consulting firms in Switzerland
is to get their transaction costs down. Some firms, like Coopers &
Lybrand, have reduced their rates and in certain cases are proposing
fixed fees rather than daily rates.

"We have to prove we offer more value for money," said C&L's Haas.
While firms can command high fees for strategy advice, delivery or
implementation work is priced at a much lower level.

"We are between the two," Haas said. "If we work on a project finding a
solution, then fees are not a problem. But on implementation, which can
take months or years, [the return is] lower."

"It's up to the whole consulting industry to improve its productivity,"
he added. "If we have the right mix between high and medium level
consulting and implementation work, profitability will be sustained.
It's also a function of the size of the firm. With 20, 30 or 40 people,
that's dangerous. But with 100 and more, you can survive."

"Clients are looking for more commodity-type support," observed D&T's
Meister. "One of the ways out is to specialise and leverage, add value
in more intense proportions. In the past, it was not unheard of that
consulting firms customised software programmes for clients at prime
rates. Today, we are using objects, modules etc to bring the cost
down."

Others are looking beyond the current focus on implementation. "In
Switzerland, McKinsey has a very strong position on the strategic side.
We don't intend to leave that area to them forever," said KPMG's
Mathers."We must get closer to the decision-making area as well as
implementation, we must be able to offer the entire range. At the
moment, our services tend to be more on [the] implementation end."

PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF A NEW MANAGEMENT PARADIGM

Over the past 20 years, a new management paradigm has
emerged that is the antithesis of mass production.
Firms employing this new paradigm rely on an integrated
set of principles and implementing practices.  First,
to get new products to market quickly they integrate
marketing, research and development, engineering,
design, production, and distribution.  Second, to
respond quickly to shifting demand they aim at
producing small lot sizes with minimal setup times -- a
practice known as lean production.  Third, to make
every aspect of production more visible they work with
fewer more qualified suppliers and involve them in
every phase of production, from product development on.
Finally, they delegate much greater operational
responsibility to those who design and manufacture the
product.

This (RAND Corp.) report uses an intensive survey of
the literature to describe and analyze this new
management paradigm.  By providing a framework for
understanding a very complicated subject, the report
serves as a resource for managers interested in those
practices that are shaping manufacturing and service
industries throughout the world.

DELAYERING THE MANAGEMENT HIERARCHY

Central to the new model of organization in the 1990s
is a flatter structure achieved by a reduction in the
number of layers of management hierarchy.  Despite
popular appeal, the fundamental claims made in the
literature remain largely unchallenged.  Like many
organizational design concepts, there is some confusion
as to what delayering means in practice, how such a
change should be implemented, and what support a
shorter management hierarchy requires.  This study from
England (Sussex University) examines the experience of
a sample of employing organizations who are or were in
the process of delayering their management structure.
Eight case study organizations were visited during the
course of the study.  The study uses the findings of
discussions to present an overall picture of the
issues.  Case study examples are used illustratively
throughout the report.

FUTURE CAREER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN ORGANIZATIONS

This report from England (Sussex University) reviews
the career issues that organizations are currently
facing and provides a perspective on how organizations
can develop their career management strategies for the
future.  It covers many issues, such as: how careers
are changing as organizations change; and what the
pressures are on individuals and organizations as large
organizations restructure.

ORGANIZATIONAL REENGINEERING

This (GAO) document presents the results from a July
1994 symposium dealing with the reengineering of
organizations.  Five principles for effective
reengineering emerged from this GAO-sponsored
symposium.  While these principles are not intended to
be an all-inclusive list on how to effectively
implement reengineering, they form the basis of a
framework for bringing about the radical change
required to reengineer business processes in a large
organization: (1) top management must be supportive of,
and engaged in, reengineering efforts to remove
barriers and drive success; (2) an organization's
culture must be receptive to reengineering goals and
principles; (3) major improvements and savings are
realized by focusing on the business from a process
rather than a functional perspective; (4) processes
should be selected for reengineering based on a clear
notion of customer needs, anticipated benefits, and
potential for success; and (5) process owners should:
manage reengineering projects with teams that are
cross-functional, maintain a proper scope, focus on
customer metrics, and enforce implementation
timeliness.  Each of these principles is covered in
detail.

OVERHEAD COSTS ON GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

This (GAO) paper focuses on overhead costs.  Overhead
cost submissions are used to establish final overhead
rates that determine reimbursements under cost-type
contracts and to provide the historical cost basis for
overhead rates used to negotiate fixed-price contracts.
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) cost
principles require government contractors to identify
and exclude unallowable costs from overhead
submissions.  The report presents an illustrative
example of what is and is not allowable with respect to
Rocketdyne Corp., where about 80% of Rocketdyne's sales
are under government cost reimbursable-type contracts.

SCHEDULING OF JOBS THAT ARRIVE OVER TIME

A natural and basic problem in scheduling theory is to
provide good average-quality service to a stream of
jobs that arrive over time.  This (Sandia National
Laboratories) paper considers the problem of scheduling
jobs that are received over time, in order to minimize
the average completion time of the set of jobs.  The
paper presents the first constant-factor approximation
algorithms for several variants of a single and
parallel machine model.  Many of the algorithms are
based on interesting algorithmic and structural
relationships between preemptive and nonpreemptive
schedules and linear programming relaxations of both,
and many generalize to the minimization or average
weighted completion time as well.

SURVEY OF SOFTWARE METRICS

This (Institute for Defense Analysis) report presents a
survey of computer software measurement practices and
technology in commercial and DOD organizations.  The
report: (1) provides summaries of 11 DOD and 14
industry programs with respect to metrics goals,
metrics program implementation, and metrics sets; (2)
reports on tools and repositories; and (3) presents
best practices.  The study concludes that industry has
more mature and vigorous practices and technology than
DOD organizations, largely because industry is applying
metrics for clear market-driven reasons while DOD
acquisition lacks comparable motivations.  The report
develops recommendations to improve software
measurement and software measurement research goals.

THE ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF DECENTRALIZING
INFRASTRUCTURE

This (International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development) collection of papers disseminates some of
the lessons of the World Bank's experience and research
efforts on the linkages between decentralization and
infrastructure service delivery.  It shows that
decentralization is not a panacea, and unless some
demanding requirements are met, performance gains will
not materialize.  More specifically, the papers
provide: (1) a summary of the lessons from World Bank
experience on decentralization as a way of providing a
general context to the importance of infrastructure
decentralization; (2) a review of the more
institutional aspects and their implications for policy
design; (3) an empirical assessment of the consequences
of decentralization on expenditure levels and on
performance in infrastructure, and some indications of
the possible handles available to policymakers to
improve the odds of successful decentralization; and
(4) a research agenda on decentralization, relying more
systematically on recent developments involving the
theory of the firm.

STRATEGY FOR AFFORDABLE LEADING-EDGE DUAL-USE
TECHNOLOGY

This (DOD) report focuses on the use of dual-use
technology in defense-related private industries.
Rapid advances in commercial technology, combined with
declining budgets, have in many cases rendered
traditional approaches to technology development and
procurement less affordable and less effective than in
the past.  It is critical that organizations take
advantage of cost-conscious market-driven commercial
production, and that they leverage the huge investments
in leading-edge process technologies made by private
industry.  It is also important that technologies and
systems keep pace with the rapid product development
cycles.  Dual use technology policies are a key
component of investment strategies for maintaining
performance superiority and affordability in this new
technological and economic defense-industry
environment.  Elements of the dual-use technology
investment strategy serve to: (1) ensure that key
elements of the technology-base that are critical for
national security remain at the leading edge; (2)
support the transitioning of defense-sponsored
technology and the integration of military production
with the commercial base; and (3) facilitate insertion
of commercial technologies into military systems.

U.S. INDUSTRY ACCESS TO JAPAN'S DEFENSE MARKET

This study (from the Logistics Management Institute)
deals with U.S. industry access to Japan's defense
market.  Historically, the U.S. has been Japan's
principal foreign source of defense material and
technology, with annual purchases averaging
approximately $1 billion during the 1980s.  This figure
could reach $2 billion if current agreements are
executed.  While Japan's defense procurement policies
are less explicit and organized than those of the U.S.,
they have generally favored U.S. industry over other
foreign competitors.  The decline of the Soviet threat,
combined with a rise in U.S.-Japanese trade friction,
could result in a diminution of U.S. industry access to
Japan's defense market.  There is a perception that
Japan has exploited U.S. defense technologies to build
competitive civilian industries, while enjoying U.S.
military protection.  Despite these problems, the study
concludes that U.S. industry's participation in Japan's
defense market is in DOD's interest and worth
continuing.  Pressuring the Japanese to accept a
reciprocal defense procurement agreement, or to adopt
DOD-style procurement practices, could be
counterproductive.

DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IN THE JAPANESE
PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY

This (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report
deals with the development of the Japanese
petrochemical industry from the 1950s through the
1960s, solely from the standpoint of the process of
technology transfer.  The technology transfer of the
Japanese petrochemical industry in this period is
interesting, because: (1) it was an industry at the
core of the heavy and chemical industries, which were
an important pillar of Japan's industrial policy; (2)
it was a new technical field with no past history; and
(3) unraveling of technology was successfully pursued,
with the result that Japan became a petrochemical
technology exporting country in the 1960s.

GLOBALIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE
INTERNATIONALIZATION OF R&D

This (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report
deals with the globalization of technology and the
internationalization of R&D.  Technology globalization
is being driven by four kinds of factors: (1) those
directly concerned with science and technology; (2)
market factors; (3) regulatory and government-related
factors; and (4) competitive factors.  The latter two
operate primarily at the level of the firm; the first
two affect the growing interdependence of national
systems  directly, as well as through the
border-spanning activities of firms that can take three
forms: (1) international technology scanning and
acquisition; (2) strategic alliances with foreign
partners; and (3) setting up R&D facilities abroad.
The paper surveys the major drivers of the
globalization of technology and the organizational
issues involved in the three modes of extending a
firm's technology reach beyond its home country, with
particular focus on Western firms' penetration of
foreign markets.

THE ROLE OF CONSORTIA IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

Technology consortia are technology alliances among
business firms, universities, and governments.  They
are formed to share the increasingly rising costs and
risks associated with undertaking basic or
precompetitive research and development (R&D).  This
study from Canada (by Industry Canada) analyzes the
role of R&D consortia in technology development.  The
study focuses on the growth of technology consortia in
the U.S., the participation of Canadian companies in
those consortia, and the institutional barriers to
Canadian membership in American R&D consortia.

STUDY OF R&D CONSORTIA IN JAPAN'S SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND
ENGINEERING CERAMICS INDUSTRY

For the past three decades, R&D consortia have been an
extensively used tool of industrial science and
technology policy in Japan; however, detailed analysis
of Japan's R&D consortia is still very limited, with
most discussions focusing on one project: the VLSI
(very large-scale integrated) circuits project of the
late 1970s.  This (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology) dissertation adds to our understanding of
cooperative R&D by examining the performance and impact
of several R&D consortia in the areas of
superconductivity and engineering ceramics.  The text
addresses: (1) project formation; (2) the nature of
technological advance; (3) organization for
collaboration; (4) the impact of consortia programs on
the technology and the industry; and (5) the existence
of general norms of collaboration.

STRENGTHENING THE U.S. MICROELECTRONICS INDUSTRY
THROUGH FEDERAL CONSORTIA POLICY

This (Sandia National Laboratories) report deals with
the use of federal technology policy to strengthen the
U.S. microelectronics industry.  A review of U.S. and
Japanese experiences with using microelectronics
consortia as a tool for strengthening their respective
industries reveals major differences.  Japan has
established catch-up consortia with focused goals.
These consortia have a finite life targeted from the
beginning, and emphasis is on work that supports or
leads to product and process-improvement-driven
commercialization.  Japan's government has played a key
role in facilitating the development of consortia and
has used consortia to promote domestic competition.

U.S. consortia, on the other hand, have often
emphasized long-range research with considerably less
focus than those in Japan.  The U.S. consortia have
searched for, and often made, revolutionary technology
advancements; however, technology transfer to their
members has been difficult.  Only SEMATECH has assisted
its members with continuous improvements involving:
compressed product cycles; established relationships;
and strengthened core competencies.  The U.S.
government has not been a catalyst, nor has it provided
leadership, in consortia creation and operation.

The study proposes that, in order to regain world
leadership in areas where U.S. companies lag foreign
competition, the U.S. should create industry-wide,
horizontal-vertical, catch-up consortia, or continue
existing consortia in the six areas where the U.S. lags
behind Japan: optoelectronics; displays; memories;
materials; packaging; and manufacturing equipment.  It
also recommends that consortia be established for
special government microelectronics and for
microelectronics research integration and application;
that these consortia be managed by an industry-led
Microelectronics Alliance whose establishment would be
coordinated by the Department of Commerce; and that the
Semiconductor Research Corporation, the National
Science Foundation Engineering Research Centers, and
relevant elements of other federal programs be
integrated into this consortia complex.

increasingly viewed as a significant factor in the
economic growth and well-being of the U.S.  Cooperative
R&D Agreements (CRADAs) are one of several mechanisms

collaborate on R&D.  CRADAs define the terms and
conditions of the collaboration.  The report reviews
the role of CRADAs in successfully transferring
technology to the private sector, and develops and
presents a series of case studies that highlight the
benefits of engaging in such collaborations at the
Departments of Agriculture, Army, Commerce, and Health
and Human Services.  While all CRADAs may not achieve
the same level of benefits, both the federal agencies
and private companies that are reviewed in the report
have benefited from these collaborations.

THE EFFECTS OF SMALL BUSINESS LENDING ON BANK PROFITS
AND RISK

Drawing on data from the `call reports' that banks file
with federal regulators, this (Texas A&M University)
study compares the profitability of more active small
business lenders to that of less active banks.  The
analysis shows that, on average, banks earn higher
profit rates on small business loans than on other
assets.  These higher-than-average rates of return are
earned by increasing the bank's risk, including capital
risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and funding risk.
Importantly, multiple regression analyses indicate that
small business loans do not affect bank profit after
adjusting for these and other risk factors.

STUDY OF THE INCIDENCE, IMPACTS, IMPLICATIONS, AND
STRATEGIES OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING

This (University of Rhode Island) study examines a
set of hypotheses regarding flexible manufacturing:
(1) manufacturing firms are increasingly relying on
flexible strategies; (2) manufacturing flexibility
coincides with vertical disintegration and
specialization in core areas of expertise; (3) flexible
manufacturing firms gain competitive advantage through
economies of scope rather than scale; (4) these firms
achieve such economies via networks of collaborative
firms; (5) such firms and their networks tend to
agglomerate geographically; and (6) such firms'
flexibility requires a broadly-skilled labor force.
The study uses national data on changes in industrial
flexibility, vertical disintegration, and
agglomeration, to rank manufacturing industries by
their apparent degree of flexibility and vertical
disintegration.  Using this ranking, three top
industries are selected based on their heavy presence
in New England and their dissimilarity: aircraft
equipment; medical instruments; and textile finishing.
The bulk of the report focuses on these three
industries.  The findings indicate diverse strategies
and patterns of inter-firm relations in the three
industries.

COMPUTER USE VERSUS FIRM SIZE

This (Popkin and Co.) paper provides new evidence on
the use of information-processing technologies by firm
size.  It does so by detailing the extent to which
computers are used by workers in firms of different
sizes.  The paper also provides estimates of the
returns by firm size to employees using computers on
their job.  Computer use leads to productivity gains
which benefit both employees that use them and firms
that invest in them.  Determining the size of those
gains by firm size is important for an understanding of
the competitive outlook for small firms in the emerging
information-based economy, and for related policy
purposes.

MANDATORY ARBITRATION: TEMPTING LEGAL FATES?

Ever since the Supreme Court ruled that
mandatory arbitration of all employment
disputes is legal in the securities industry,
many other companies have required applicants
to accept similar provisions as a condition for
being hired. This may be tempting the legal
fates.

Congressional staffers, lawyers and researchers
who study employment and human resource issues
say those mandatory agreements may not be legal
outside the security field, and could raise a
host of potential legal liabilities, including
violation of legislative intent, obstruction of
justice or contempt of court charges, and civil
rights violations. The agreements also raise
the specter of new federal legislation
regulating employment.

In addition, mandatory arbitration may not even
reduce the cost of litigation.  An extensive
study shows that--when compared to juries--
arbitrators actually favor employees more, and
award higher settlements.

ARE THEY LEGAL?

In Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., the
Supreme Court upheld pre-employment arbitration
agreements required by the National Association
of Securities Dealers. Left unaddressed is
whether those provisions are legal in any other
industry.

Currently, cases dealing with such agreements
in nonsecurities corporations are working their
way through the courts.

Critics of the corporate rush to lower
litigation costs by having all applicants sign
away their right to sue say those clauses may
be illegal. At least one prominent arbitrator
agrees.

 "You can drawn an analogy to workers'
compensation laws," he says. "Under those
statutes, an employee cannot waive his
litigation rights -- even if he wants to do
so."

The critics also charge that the agreements go
against the intent of Congress when it enacted
anti-discrimination laws and statutes barring
sexual harassment. Courts look to legislative
intent when ruling on legality. The General
Accounting Office --at the request of two
lawmakers--is studying whether pre-employment
arbitration provisions "affect the enforcement
of federal [employment discrimination] laws."

THE INTENT ISSUE

Speaking of the issue of subverting
congressional intent, the arbitrator says,
"There may be something to that." The
agreements "may constitute either willful or
inadvertent subversion of civil rights." That
is because such laws as the Civil Rights Act of
1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
and the American with Disabilities Act all
contain provisions allowing aggrieved workers
to file civil suits against their employers.

"If we didn't want those cases to go to court,
we wouldn't have included those provisions,"
says a key congressional aide who helped draft
some of the statutes.

The GAO study may be an omen of future laws,
says Christine Keen, a principal in the Domani
Group, a Washington research organization. By
relying on the agreements, "corporations could
be tempting federal legislation."

 Keen, who previously handled legislative
issues for the Society for Human Resource
Management, says some state may enact
legislation banning the contracts.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE?

A former senior Justice Department official
tells us that corporations that use pre-
employment arbitration contracts may be--at
best--risking contempt citations, or
obstruction of justice charges in a worst-case
scenario.

MANDATORY ARBITRATION
(CONTINUED)

The official, whose views are in the minority,
explains that Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission guidelines require corporations to
investigate all sexual harassment charges.

 He also says that some civil rights laws
contain an "affirmative obligation" on the part
of employers to report discrimination charges
to investigators.  "By burying those charges in
an arbitration panel," he says, employers could
be obstructing justice.

Another Justice Department alumni disagrees. "I
could see civil contempt proceedings, but
obstruction of justice is creative thinking,"
says the attorney who has prosecuted people for
that charge.

Others note that federal agencies--including
Congress, the EEOC and the National Labor
Relations Board--have said it is good public
policy to arbitrate rather than litigate
disputes. The prominent arbitrator agrees, but
adds that those statutes and rules "aren't
analogous to a corporation saying that--prior
to employment--you have to arbitrate all future
[legal] claims" and give up your right to sue.

HOW ABOUT DIVERSITY?

Yet another issue is diversity -- or rather the
lack of it -- on securities industry panels --
and its effect on discrimination claims.
According to a GAO audit, 89 percent of the 726
arbitrators used were white males over the age
of 60 with little employment law experience.

The industry is "asking these people to deal
with problems they have never encountered and
have no experience with," says an employment
attorney. The lawyer, who currently has a
client before one of those panels, believes
that the arbitrators may not be qualified to
handle complex employment litigation.

Also, this attorney says the lack of diversity
could "raise potential civil rights problems."
She says that employees could argue in court or
before federal agencies that the panels do not
use the EEOC's "reasonable woman" standard when
hearing sexual harassment claims. Those
guidelines require that investigators and/or
corporate officials see the charges from the
female point of view.

DOES ARBITRATION WORK?

Most corporations see arbitration as a way to
reduce the burgeoning cost of employment
litigation. But it may just be a placebo.

"Arbitration is not the Shangri-La that many
think it is," says the Domani Group's Keen. She
cites a GAO report issued earlier this month,
finding that securities industry arbitrators
resolved 34 discrimination claims between 1990
and 1992. Of the 18 cases looked at in depth,
10 resulted in financial awards to employees;
eight were decided in favor of the brokerage
houses.

A study by the California State Automobile
Association had similar findings. While that
study only examined personal injury lawsuits,
it came to the same conclusion: arbitrators may
not save companies money. In 45 cases where the
arbitrator's award was rejected, juries
returned lower damages 73 percent of the time.
That study confirms an earlier nonpublished
examination of a California law mandating pre-
trial arbitration of suits seeking less than
$50,000.

BROADER ISSUES

"The broader issue is whether employers and
employees can buy and sell individual rights.
If you make arbitration a condition of
employment, you're asking someone to sell off
their right to a jury trial," Keen says. "In
that respect, it's no different than the
yellow-dog contracts of the 1930s."

 Before the enactment of the National Labor
Relations Act, corporations required applicants
to agree never to join a union. Those so-called
"yellow-dog" contracts are now illegal. "I
would advise clients [wanting to implement
arbitration agreements] to go slowly," says one
labor lawyer. "After all, if they are found to
be legal, you can always have employees sign
them. If they're not [legal], why risk the
potential litigation?"

The attorney may have a point. In anticipation
of the upcoming GAO study, some members of
Congress are said to be drafting legislation
that would limit the use of mandatory pre-
employment arbitration agreements.

The following are actual cases that have been
heard by national and state courts, the NLRB or
senior arbitration panels.

OSHA PROPOSES SMOKING BAN

As expected, regulations proposed by the
Occupational Safety & Health Administration
would effectively ban smoking at every
workplace in the country. The rule, which
applies to all indoor or enclosed worksites
under OSHA's jurisdictions, is seen as part of
the Clinton administration's continuing anti-
smoking campaign.

President and Mrs. Clinton have banned smoking
inside the White House. Recently the Defense
Department announced a no-smoking policy at all
military bases and offices. The same day OSHA
released its proposal, the head of the Food and
Drug Administration asked Congress for guidance
over whether to regulate nicotine as a drug.
Meanwhile, the House is set to vote on a bill
that would codify OSHA's proposed anti-smoking
regulations into law.

WHAT THE RULES SAY


The OSHA proposals, expected to take effect in
1995 at the earliest, would require employers--
including building owners--to either outrightly
prohibit tobacco usage or to establish
designated smoking areas and only permit
smoking there.

Smoking areas must be "enclosed and exhausted
directly to the outside" and contain all smoke
within the room. Essentially, building owners
or employers would have to install separate
ventilation systems for the smoking areas. That
would make permitting smoking a prohibitively
expense proposition in many workplaces. The
legislation currently making its way through
Congress contains a similar provision.

Employees who do not smoke must not "be
required to enter [the] designated smoking
areas in the performance of [their] normal work
activities." In addition, smoking would be
barred from the rooms while the ventilation
system was being repaired.

In addition to the Tobacco Institute, the
biggest opposition to the proposals is expected
to come from restaurant and bar owners, and
hotel associations. The proposed regulations
would cover eateries and could force them to
ban smoking, according to some OSHA officials.
Restaurant owners maintain that would cost them
smokers' patronage, at a time when the industry
is just beginning to recover from the effects
of the recession.

While the anti-smoking provisions have gotten
the most press, the indoor air quality rule
goes much further. Joseph Dear, OSHA's
administrator, acknowledges that it "is one of
the most extensive ever proposed."

It covers what OSHA calls "building-related
illness" (including sensory irritation,
allergies, infections, humidifier fever,
certain types of pneumonitis, Legionnaires'
disease and chemical exposures). Employers
under the rule would keep written records of
employment complaints, as well as "signs or
symptoms that may be related to building-
related illness."

The regulation--technically an indoor air
quality standard--would require building owners
or corporations to submit written compliance
plans, including a written maintenance program
for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
systems.

In addition, employers would be forced to
conduct inspections, ventilate all fumes that
"could reasonably be expected to result" in
hazardous or particulate exposures to workers,
keep relative humidity below 60%, and maintain
rooms that have windows that open.

WHAT OSHA'S SMOKING RULE REQUIRES

Listed below is the full text of the proposed
OSHA regulation, which would ban smoking in all
workplaces. The regulation, included in the
Indoor Air Quality Standard, covers "offices,
educational facilities, commercial
establishments, healthcare facilities, and
office areas, cafeterias, and break rooms
located [or] used by employees."

In workplaces where the smoking of tobacco
products is not prohibited, the employer shall
establish designated smoking areas and permit
smoking only in such areas.

The employer shall assure that designated
smoking areas are enclosed and exhausted
directly to the outside, and are maintained
under negative pressure (with respect to
surrounding spaces) sufficient to contain
tobacco smoke within the designated area.

The employer shall assure that cleaning and
maintenance work in designated smoking areas is
conducted only when no smoking is taking place.

The employer shall assure that employees are
not required to enter designated smoking areas
in the performance of normal work activities.

The employer shall post signs clearly
indicating areas that are designated smoking
areas, and the employer shall post signs that
will clearly inform anyone entering the
workplace that smoking is restricted to
designated areas.

The employer shall prohibit smoking in
designated smoking areas during any period that
the exhaust ventilation system servicing that
area is not properly operating.

IS IT AGE BIAS TO DISCHARGE A  SECRETARY WHEN
HER BOSS RETIRES?

The following are actual cases that have been
heard by national and state courts, the NLRB or
senior arbitration panels.
THE PROBLEM: Betty Moses had been Joseph
Griesedieck's secretary for 22 years when he
retired as chairman of the board of the
Falstaff Brewing Corporation. Following her
boss's retirement, she was told that she was
being let go.

Moses then sued Falstaff for violating the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. At the trial,
Moses's attorney argued that it was age that
led to Betty Moses's dismissal. She's 48. An
employee with her seniority, experience and
know-how could easily have been absorbed by one
of the company's departments.

Falstaff countered:

  *   We do not practice age discrimination. We
employ men and women of all ages.

  *   However, we have long had a consistent
policy of eliminating the job of secretary when
an officer's functions with the company are
terminated.

THE ANSWER: Case dismissed. Falstaff had a
long-standing policy that secretaries to
officers remained with those persons when the
officers changed positions in the organization.
The secretaries lost their jobs when their
bosses were eliminated or retired, the U.S.
Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, found.  Neither
young nor old secretaries were spared when the
sad day came. Betty Moses's age had nothing to
do with her fate (550 F.2df 1113).

COMMENT: Betty Moses would have had a stronger
case if she had been able to show:

  *   She was replaced by a younger person.

  *   A company officer told her that age was a
factor in her firing.

  *   Statistical evidence showed a pattern of
age discrimination by the employer.

WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS OF  OVERSELLING A JOB?

THE PROBLEM:  The sudden resignation of John
Lund forced Ed Tutwiler Cadillac, Inc. to find
a quick replacement. President E.M.Tutwiler III
sought out Tim Snodgrass, who worked for a
rival company, and guaranteed him a substantial
jump in compensation plus a bonus based on his
department's profit.

The division was a "money maker," Tutwiler
promised, saying that Lund had been employed on
the same basis and had done quite well. Shortly
afterward, Snodgrass quit his job and joined
Tutwiler.

Snodgrass soon regretted the job switch. The
Tutwiler division was a money loser, not a
money maker. Not only did it lose money during
Snodgrass's brief tenure, but it also had been
heavily in the red during John Lund's
incumbency.

Within three months, Snodgrass became
disillusioned and was terminated after several
bitter quarrels with Tutwiler. Snodgrass then
struck back at Tutwiler with a lawsuit for
fraud, alleging he had been lured away from a
safe job with lies about the profitability of
the Tutweiler division and the prospect of
future earnings. Because of the
misrepresentation, he lost income and was
unemployed for a considerable time, Snodgrass
said.

The employer responded that all it was guilty
of was making optimistic predictions about
Snodgrass's future with the company. It's no
crime to build up a job's potential, Tutweiler
asserted.

THE ANSWER: Snodgrass wins his case. Tutwiler's
effusions about the job were more than mere
optimism, the Indiana Court of Appeals found.
Tutwiler deceived Snodgrass about his
predecessor's earnings and the financial
condition of the department. Said the court:

"We agree with Snodgrass that his claim for
fraud is not based upon any predictions or
promises by Tutwiler as to what Snodgrass could
expect to earn as used car manager. Rather it
is based on misrepresentations regarding the
used car department's financial status" (428
N.E.2d 1291).

COMMENT: A company does not commit fraud when
it merely paints a job with glowing colors to a
prospective employee and suggests that a great
future may await him. But a company should be
careful about getting into specifics.

WHEN IS A JOB TERMINATED?

THE PROBLEM: Pat Linz was data processing
manager at the Hoerner Waldorf Corporation when
the firm merged with the Champion International
Corporation. Linz was offered a data processing
managership with Champion, but a study of the
proposed job convinced him that, although his
title would be unchanged, his functions would
be diminished.

At this point, Linz informed Champion that he
regarded his job as "terminated" and he
requested severance pay. When Champion rejected
the request, Linz brought suit for the
severance pay, pointing out that under the
merger agreement, all Hoerner Waldorf employees
were entitled to severance pay if terminated.
His job entailed computer programming, systems
design, analysis, implementation, user service
and data processing. The Champion job would
require less systems design, implementation,
and programming, Linz told the court.

A Champion spokesman rebutted:

  *   The job it offered Linz was substantially
similar to the one he held at Hoerner Waldorf.
The trouble is that he's too finicky.

  *   Linz was not terminated; he quit of his
own accord. He doesn't merit severance pay.

THE ANSWER: No severance pay for Linz; he quit
of his own free will. The Montana Supreme Court
pointed to Webster's definition that
"terminate" means "to put an end to; make to
cease; to end." This had not been the fate of
Linz's position. The court stated:

"Champion offered Linz a comparable position in
his city of residence. His salary was equal to
that he received from his position with Hoerner
Waldorf, with an increase scheduled soon
thereafter. From these facts, we cannot find
that Linz's position was terminated" (675 P.2d
979).

COMMENT: An employee's right to consider a
position to be "terminated" often depends on
how a change in position is effected. Thus, an
employee's contention that his job was
terminated was upheld when he was stripped of
his title of branch manager while his pay and
duties remained unchanged. A Colorado court
found that, without the title, the employee had
lost the respect of co-workers and clients (657
P.2d 457).

CAN A COMPANY MAKE IT A POLICY  TO GIVE EX-
EMPLOYEES A BAD RAP?

THE PROBLEM: As long as employees worked for
William Brown's publishing company, they were
treated as friends and confidants. But any
employee who left Brown's employ soon found
that Brown's benevolence had changed to
implacable hostility.

Thus, the wrath of William Brown descended upon
Patricia Marshall who left his company after
years of service. Marshall was on the verge of
receiving a well-paying job with Jill Boxley
until Boxley telephoned Marshall's ex-boss
about a reference.

"Patricia Marshall was erratic in her work
habits," Brown began. "She brought her personal
problems to the office. Of course, if this the
kind of employee you want..."

Patricia Marshall immediately retaliated with a
lawsuit against the publishing company and its
chief for "wrongful interference with
prospective employment."

At the trial, Marshall had little difficulty
proving that the words attributed to Brown were
unmitigated lies. Brown took the stand and
swore he had never made those comments to Jill
Boxley, but Boxley reaffirmed that Brown had
made the offending remarks.

THE ANSWER: Patricia Marshall wins her case;
and she'll get heavy damages, too. In comparing
the differing versions of the telephone
conversation, the California Court of Appeal
found Jill Boxley's to be more credible. What
made a strong impact on the court was testimony
by George Ryan, a one-time company supervisor
who asserted that Brown "...told me to make it
a policy to give bad references to former
employees. He'd say, 'Shoot them down in
flames'"(190 Cal.Rptr.392).

COMMENT: An employer who intentionally
dispenses untruthful references about an ex-
employee in some instances may even face
criminal charges, depending on state law.

MUST EMPLOYEES BE REIMBURSED FOR A PAY CUT IF
BUSINESS IMPROVES?

The Problem: When a series of reverses put Bob
Adams Motors, Inc., in the red, president Bob
Adams called his personnel to a meeting where
he said: "We can either fire a number of you--
or we can cut everyone's pay 20 percent. Which
will it be?"

The assembled employees agreed to accept a pay
cut. Bob Adams thanked his employees and then
exclaimed: "If business improves by the end of
the year, you'll be reimbursed--if possible."

By the following year, business had improved
sufficiently for the company to restore
salaries to their former level, but then Bob
Adams sold the  business to new owners. At this
point, the staff sued Bob Adams for
"defrauding" them out of the money he had
deducted from their salaries, asserting:

  * Bob Adams made us believe that the pay cut
would be reimbursed to us if business improved.
He reneged on that promise. Business did
improve - but he never gave us back our money.
That was fraud!

Not so, countered Bob Adams. All he promised
was that "if possible" he would repay the
wages.

The Answer: No reimbursement for the employees.
To the Missouri Court of Appeals, Bob Adams's
remarks at the pay cut gathering were "a mere
promise or expression of opinion--neither of
which are enforceable" (550 S.W.2d 850).

COMMENT: It must be borne in mind, however,
that an employer will not escape unscathed from
pay restitution demands where the reductions
violate the minimum-wage law, deny employees
overtime pay due them under the wage-hour law,
or are tainted by violations of the anti-
discrimination laws.

At this point, the staff banded together and
sued Bob Adams for "defrauding" them out of the
money he had deducted from their salaries. In
court, the employees inveighed:

PROBLEM RESOLUTION

The following policies are currently in use in
the companies named. Requests for anonymity
have been respected.
When employees believe they have been treated
unfairly in relation to established corporate
policies, where do they turn? Formal problem
resolution procedures can help protect the
rights of both employees and employers. A not-
for-profit rehabilitation firm uses these
procedures as a guide for administering its
policies fairly.

1.  The employee will file a statement with the
supervisor on a form to be provided by the
Corporation. The Supervisor will meet with the
employee and attempt to resolve the problem or
situation.

2.  In the event the problem or situation
cannot be resolved in Step 1, the employee and
supervisor will submit separate written
statements regarding the problem to the
appropriate administrative staff person. This
individual will meet with both parties and
review any relevant materials. Then a written
statement of resolution will be issued by this
reviewer.

3.  If the employee remains dissatisfied, an
appeal using the same process may be made to
the Executive Director. The Executive Director
will issue a written statement of the
resolution after meeting with the involved
parties and reviewing the written materials.
The Board of Directors will be informed by the
Executive Director of all problems handled
under this procedure regardless of the level at
which they are resolved. The Board of Directors
may choose to undertake further review or
action.

FUNERAL/BEREAVEMENT POLICY

A company without clear guidelines for funeral
or bereavement leave may find itself in a
squeeze--leaving the employee feeling
distraught as well as harassed, while the
company questions its reimbursement obligation
for attendance at the wakes of distance
relatives. Mount St. Mary's Hospital of Niagara
Falls, N.Y., avoids such problems with the
following.

An excused absence from work with straight time
pay to attend the funeral and make burial
arrangements will be allowed for full-time
employees who have completed their probationary
period and have furnished the Hospital with
reasonable proof of relationship with the
deceased relative as follows:

A.  In the event of death of spouse, child
(stepchildren, foster children and adopted
children), parent (stepparent), brother,
sister, mother-in-law or father-in-law, up to
three (3) work days with pay. The employee is
not entitled to the benefits if the employee
was not scheduled to work these days. If the
deceased family member resided over 500 miles
from Niagara Falls, up to five (5) days with
straight pay is allowed.

B.  In the event of death of grandparent, up to
one (1) day.

C. In the event of death of any other relative
who resided at the time of death in the
employee's household, up to one (1) day.

D. Part-time employees regularly scheduled to
work fifteen (15) or more hours per week are
allowed up to one (1) work day off with
straight time pay in the event of death in the
immediate family, as stated in Section A.

E. Should such death occur during an employee's
vacation, the vacation days involved are to be
converted to funeral leave on the payroll and
vacation days extended or rescheduled.

The above funeral allowance will not be paid
for "ex in-laws" after a legal divorce has been
in force.

POLITICAL ACTIVITY

Some government agencies or departments have
strict rules about who may or may not run for
political office. The State Education
Department of the University of the State of
New York clearly spells out its stipulations.

Department employees are free to engage in any
political activity which is not precluded by
New York State Law or by Department policy
concerning Department employees who run for
public office. The provisions of the State
Civil Service Law prohibit requiring employees
to contribute to any political fund or perform
any political service, nor can you be promoted,
demoted, or dismissed for compliance or refusal
to do so. No one is permitted to use his or her
influence to force the political activity of
any person or group or to interfere with any
election. Employees with questions concerning
this matter may wish to read Section 107 of the
Civil Service Law available in the Division of
Personnel. Employees who are considering
running for office should check with their
supervisors concerning Department policy.

ADOPTIVE PARENT LEAVE

Since passage of the Family Medical Leave Act,
which mandates employers to offer up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave to care for a family
member, many organizations are adding adoption
leave to their policies. This East Coast
personnel and labor relations office outlines
its guidelines.

Any employee who adopts a child may request
child care leave for up to seven months. This
leave may start any time from the data the
adoptive child is placed with the family to the
effective date of the adoption. An employee is
not required to exhaust all appropriate leave
credits before being granted leave without pay,
but may choose to do so. No sick leave or sick
leave with half pay will be approved.

HIRING OF RELATIVES

Nepotism is a sensitive issue at many
companies. The following is the policy at Parma
Community General Hospital in Ohio.

The employment of relatives in the same work
area of an organization may cause serious
conflicts and problems with favoritism and
employee morale. In addition to claims of
partiality in treatment at work, personal
conflicts from outside the work environment can
be carried into day-to-day working
relationships.

Relatives of persons currently employed by the
Hospital may be hired only if they will not be
working directly for or supervising a relative
or will not occupy a position in the same line
of authority within the organization. This
policy applies to any relative, higher or lower
in the organization, who has the authority to
review employment decisions. Hospital employees
cannot be transferred into such a reporting
relationship.

If the relative relationship is established
after employment, the individuals concerned
will decide who is to be transferred. If that
decision is not made within 30 calendar days,
management will decide, taking into
consideration various factors, including but
not limited to the needs of the Hospital, the
employee's respective skills, qualifications,
length of service, etc.

In other cases where a conflict or the
potential for conflict arises, even if there is
no supervisory relationship involved, the
parties may be separated by reassignment or
terminated from employment.

For the purposes of this policy, relatives are
defined to include spouses, parents, children,
brothers, sisters, brothers- and sisters-in-
law, fathers- and
mothers-in-law, grandparents, aunts, uncles,
first cousins, stepparents, stepbrothers,
stepsisters, and stepchildren. This policy also
applies to individuals who are not legally
related but who reside with another employee.

MENTAL AND PHYSICAL APTITUDE

The Jay Packaging Group, Inc., of Warwick,
R.I., states in its employment policies manual
that new people coming on board are considered
additions to the Jay family. At the same time,
the company specifies that certain expectations
must be met to fit into this "family."

  *   Successful applicants will, as a
condition of employment, be required to
complete a Wonderlic Comprehension and
Mechanical Aptitude Test. This test is intended
to gauge the candidate's ability to learn and
apply instructions received and the candidate's
ability to recognize spatial relationships.

  *   All non-English-speaking candidates will
be advised by the Human Resources Director or
Employment Representative that in order to
progress within the company, the candidate must
be able to communicate, read and write in
English. No candidate will enter a progression
program unless they are able to communicate in
the basic company language, which is English.
English-speaking classes are provided by the
company on a voluntary basis.

  *   All new hires will undergo a post-
employment-offer physical examination and drug
test. These examinations must be conducted
after the employment offer is made, but before
the employee begins work. The employment offer
is conditional upon passing the physical
examination and drug test.

Unified School District in 1977 as a nurse.
Fifteen years later, in the middle of a budget

MENTAL DISCRIMINATION  #2 ADA COMPLAINT

Discrimination on the basis of mental
disability is the second most commonly filed
complaint under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, finds a report by the Office of Technology
Assessment. The large number of 1,710
complaints received hints at the importance of
discrimination against people with psychiatric
disabilities, OTA notes.

The mentally disabled have three major problems
working on a regular basis: functioning in
society, difficulty concentrating and coping
with day-to-day stress, according to the
report.

The report also says that some mental health
experts believe there is "a significant
correlation between psychopathology, treatment
status and work." As a result, OTA says access
to effective treatment may be the deciding
factor in whether some mentally disabled people
can work, and employers may need to include
educational, psychosocial and vocational
services in any "reasonable accommodation"
under the ADA. Finally, the report hints that
Congress may have to address some unanswered
questions such as, "Can mentally disabled
employees be required to take medication as a
condition for keeping their jobs?," or "Can
employers monitor medication as part of a
reasonable accommodation?" For a copy of the
report, contact the OTA at (202) 224-8996.

INTENT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO OSHA

A federal appeals court rules that intent
doesn't matter when it comes to willful
violations of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act. The Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals holds that the law "makes irrelevant
the employer's good faith disregard of the
regulations, or the employer's belief that its
alternative program meets the objectives of
OSHA's regulations." (Martin v. Trinity
Industries Inc., CA-11, 92-2559)  In 1983, an
OSHA inspector found excessive noise levels in
the plant. Rather than installing a monitoring
system, the employer required workers to wear
protective gear whenever they were in the
plant. Even though those requirements went
beyond OSHA's regulations, the company was
cited for a willful violation in 1987. The
second OSHA inspector made the citation because
the company knew it had violated the noise
regulations and its hazard abatement program
did not meet OSHA's written

PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS FOR OPIATE
DEPENDENCE: METHADONE AND MORE

The hunt for a "magic bullet," some kind of pill, to cure drug
dependence continues in research institutions throughout the country,
but methadone is still the gold standard by which other treatments are
measured. Methadone, however, is only for opiate addiction. And two
other drugs, LAAM and bu prenorphine, are expected to be available
soon for the treatment of opiate addiction.

"Methadone maintenance is the most effective pharmacotherapy for
any drug dependence," says Thomas Kosten, M.D., a Yale University
drug researcher who conducts federally funded studies on
pharmacological treatments for opiate dependency. Speaking at a
conference last year in Washington, Dr. Kosten explains the key
points to be remembered about methadone:

To work, the daily dose of methadone must be at least 65 milligrams;
the average dose given in the United States is only 45 milligrams a
day --not enough, so methadone is not generally being given a fair
trial.

At least two years on methadone is needed to make an impact; with
any less time, "you just run people in and out, in and out" of
treatment. The 180-day detoxification authorized by the Food and
Drug Administration is "not very promising."

Psychosocial supports are required, not just methadone. "A juice-bar
dispensing station may be better than nothing at all, but not much
better," says Dr. Kosten. The link to primary medical care should be
within the methadone program itself. Even though opiate addicts tend
to need medical attention, they don't make an effort to get it, says Dr.
Kosten.

When HIV-positive opiate addicts enter methadone programs, their
immune systems improve based on the activity level of "killer T-
cells," says Dr. Kosten. Since most cities now have 20-to 40-percent
HIV infection rates among injecting drug users, the AIDS-reduction
aspect of methadone is important.

Methadone's down side: it only affects opiates. Opiate addicts abuse
alcohol, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. Once on methadone, the
craving for opiates goes away, if the dose is high enough. But other
drugs may continue to be abused; the pharmacological action of
methadone will not help with them.

LAAM AND BUPRENORPHINE

The FDA has approved LAAM, which is essentially a long-acting
form of methadone, for the treatment of opiate addiction. Unlike
methadone, LAAM does not need to be taken every day, reducing the
need for take-home doses. One 60-to 80-milligram dose of LAAM can
be taken every other day, says Dr. Kosten, noting that heroin addicts
need to take heroin four or five times a day. With heroin, they get
high quickly, and they get sick quickly if they don't get more. With
methadone, this process is slowed down. And with LAAM, it is
slowed down even more.

One problem with LAAM is that it has a slow induction, taking
several days before a patient will feel okay. Since patients go through
a mild heroin withdrawal while on LAAM, before the slower-acting
drug takes effect, they are likely to drop out of treatment. After all,
they don't want to feel sick -- that's why they go for help in the first
place.

A solution to this problem, says Dr. Kosten, is to start people on
methadone and switch them over to LAAM. For this option to work,
it means the clinic must offer both methadone and LAAM.

Buprenorphine, another alternative to methadone, has the benefit of
having a shorter and less severe withdrawal. At a daily dose of two
milligrams, buprenorphine would prevent opiate withdrawal
symptoms. At high doses of 20 or 30 milligrams a day, it would
actually block the effects of opiates. Buprenorphine is a painkiller in
very low doses. The typical dose for an opiate addict being maintained
on buprenorphine is from 8 to 16 milligrams a day, says Dr. Kosten.

THE DETOXIFICATION PROBLEM

With all maintenance drugs, one thorny problem arises when a patient
wants to become drug-free. Detoxification from these medications can
be uncomfortable, especially for an addict who has habitually turned
to opiates for relief from that very discomfort. Researchers are still
working on the best ways to help patients
withdraw from maintenance medications.

Naltrexone is an opiate-blocking medication which has no effects of
its own, but which prevents opiates from having any effect.
Researchers had developed naltrexone with the premise that patients
could take it home, take one every morning, and know that whether
they injected heroin or not, they would not get high. Perhaps not
surprisingly, naltrexone was a failure because of compliance problems:
people didn't take it.

Researchers are now working on an injectable form of naltrexone. The
injection could be given once a month, and the blockade would last
until the next month's injection, says Dr. Kosten.

CLONIDINE, ALONE AND IN COMBINATION

Clonidine helps with the severity of opiate withdrawal, but not the
duration, says Dr. Kosten. For example, if methadone is stopped,
withdrawal symptoms will last about two weeks. If clonidine is given,
withdrawal will still last two weeks, but be somewhat less painful.
However, if clonidine is combined with naltrexone, the entire
methadone withdrawal process can be accomplished in three days.

In the most recent development, this approach can be used for
someone maintained on buprenorphine. A heroin addict or a
methadone maintained patient can be switched to buprenorphine, than
detoxified in a day hospital using naltrexone plus clonidine over an 8-
hour period. "You can get them from opiate-dependent to drug-free in
less than a day," says Dr.
Kosten.

ONDCP, CLINTON `UNEQUIVOCALLY OPPOSED' TO
LEGALIZATION

Legalizing drugs, mentioned as a possible anti-crime measure last
month by U.S. Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders, does not appear to be
an option for this Administration. Although the Surgeon General had
only suggested, in remarks at a National Press Club lunch, that
legalization was worth study -- and she stressed that she was speaking
for herself only -- the Administration hastily sought to undo any
impression that it was soft on drugs.

"The Administration has stated that legalization is a formula for self-
destruction and that it is unequivocally opposed to any `reform' such
as this that is certain to increase drug use," said Lee P. Brown,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. "Legalization
would, in the Administration's view, do terrifying damage to
communities, families, and individuals that are already being torn
apart by drug availability and drug use. Any change in the current
policy of prohibiting drug use would seriously impair anti-drug
education efforts, drug-free community programs, drug-free workplace
programs, and the overall national effort to reduce the level of drug
use and its consequences."

The costs of prohibition, while they should not be minimized, are
nowhere near the costs of legalizing drug use, said Brown.

FEDERAL DRUG BUDGET SMALLER THAN THAT OF
CITIES AND STATES

The federal government spends less than state and local governments
on the drug effort, according to a recent survey conducted for the
Office of National Drug Control Policy. The survey, conducted by the
U.S. Bureau of the Census, applies to funding for criminal justice,
education, and treatment.

In 1991, state and local governments spent $15.9 billion on drug-
related activities, a 13-percent increase over what they spent in 1990.
The federal government, on the other hand, spent $11 billion on drug-
related activities in 1991.

"This survey demonstrates the substantial costs drug use has imposed
on state and local governments," said Lee P. Brown, ONDCP
director, in releasing the results at the start of a
meeting with representatives of governors and big-city mayors last
month. The survey "makes clear the necessity of reducing drug use
and the crime and violence associated with it," he said.

Although states frequently chastise the federal equation which gives
over 70 percent of anti-drug funding to law enforcement, they appear
to be forced to do the same thing. The criminal justice system
accounted for 79 percent of drug-related dollars spent by state and
local governments, according to the survey. Treatment and education,
or prevention, shared the
remaining 21 percent.

The National Drug Control Strategy, to be released by the ONDCP
early this year, will have more input from states and localities than it
has in past years, thanks to the two-day meeting held with governors'
and mayors' representatives last month. Brown is relying on states and
localities to continue to help fund the battle against drug abuse and
crime. But he is also giving them a chance to contribute to the
development of the national strategy.

The study can be obtained by contacting the Drugs and Crime
Clearinghouse at (800)666-3332.

STUDY: 11-PERCENT OF DELIVERING WOMEN TEST
POSITIVE FOR DRUGS

In one of the largest studies of its kind, over 11 percent of women
were found to have consumed drugs just before going into labor. The
study was conducted in California on a broad range of women who are
representative of the state's population. Published last year in The
New England Journal of Medicine (Volume 329, Number 12), the
study shows that doctors, clinics, and public health campaigns need to
do more to communicate the harmful aspects of drug use during
pregnancy. The study was conducted by researchers at several
universities and funded by the California Department of Alcohol and
Drug Programs.

The study looked at drug use, including alcohol use, by anonymous,
coded urine tests, administered in the hospitals prior to delivery.
Smoking was based on self-reports -- in California, all delivering
women are supposed to be asked about tobacco use.

The researchers tabulated the results by ethnic group. Black women
had the highest prevalence rates, followed by Hispanic women. Below
is a chart showing, by ethnic group, prevalence rates.


*  The percentage figures in the parentheses refer to the percentage of
births accounted for by each respective ethnic or racial group in
California.

The researchers were particularly concerned about Hispanic women.
The birth rate is high for this ethnic group: although only one-fourth
of women in California are Hispanic, they account for half of the
births. In addition, language was related to drug use during pregnancy,
the researchers found: one of every three women who tested positive
for alcohol did not speak English. Perhaps they are unaware of the
warning labels on alcoholic beverages, the researchers suggested. In
addition, medical care professionals may not be effectively
communicating the risks of drinking during pregnancy to these
women.

 Because urine tests only measure recent drug use, actual prevalence
of drug and alcohol use during pregnancy was probably higher than
the test results showed, the researchers said. Drug use during
pregnancy can result in low birth weight, prematurity, fetal distress,
stillbirth, malformations, and neurobehavioral dysfunction, the
researchers noted.

The sample size for the study was 30,000, and represented the ethnic
and racial groups of the 600,000 infants delivered in the state over a
one-year period ending June 30, 1992.

DRUG CONSUMPTION: IS IT POSSESSION?

A recent drug possession case in Washington State shows the
difference between assimilation, in which a drug is ingested and
assimilated into the body, and concealment, in which a drug is
ingested but not assimilated. The defendant, Curtis Lee Rudd, had
been convicted of cocaine possession based on baggies of cocaine
which had been pumped from his stomach. He claimed that the
evidence was not sufficient to convict him, but the Court of Appeals
of Washington, Division 2, disagreed. The court upheld the lower
court conviction, saying Rudd's case was one of
concealment.

In concealment, the drugs are ingested or otherwise inserted into the
body in a balloon, a baggie, or a similar container, the ruling said.
"Rather than being assimilated into the bloodstream, the substance
remains concealed in the body until retrieved or expelled." Evidence
showing concealment is usually sufficient to support a conviction for
possession, the court said.

With assimilation, on the other hand, the drugs are swallowed,
injected, or otherwise put directly into the body. The drugs enter the
bloodstream, where the user loses "dominion and control" over them.
Since dominion and control are the key features of possession, it is
virtually impossible to support a conviction for possession based only
on assimilation, the court said.

Rudd had swallowed the baggies in a motel bathroom while police
were trying to arrest him. Some of the bags broke in the process,
however, and he felt quite ill. He told the police he had swallowed the
bags of cocaine, and asked to be taken to a hospital, where his
stomach was pumped. The case is State v. Rudd, 856 P.2d 699
(Wash. App. Div. 2 1993).

ALL NME LAWSUITS NOW RESOLVED

National Medical Enterprises wrapped up 1993 by resolving the last
of the lawsuits against it by 13 insurance companies. The Santa
Monica-based chain of psychiatric hospitals announced last month that
it had agreed to pay $90 million to settle the fraud and abuse claims.
Insurance companies had charged that the company had
billed them for inappropriate services.

But NME's problems aren't over yet. There are still some patient
lawsuits in Texas to be settled. And the federal government is also
investigating possible health-care fraud at the company.

It appears that NME may be getting out of the behavioral health care
business, however. Its psychiatric hospitals are reportedly for sale, and
the company is expected to focus on its community hospitals instead.

COSTS OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: SICKNESS AND
DEATH PREDOMINATE

Another study of the economic costs of alcohol dependence has shown
the potential cost-effectiveness of treating alcoholism in early stages.
In the current issue of Alcohol Health & Research World (Volume 17,
Number 1, 1993), estimated economic costs of the disease are outlined
for 1990. The majority of costs were due to alcohol-related diseases
and deaths. Only a fraction of costs were due to direct treatment for
the disease.

Below is a chart outlining the costs of alcohol dependence. Direct
costs are those for which payments are made; indirect costs are those
for which resources, such as income, are lost.

The statistics were compiled by Dorothy P. Rice, a professor in the
School of Nursing, University of California, San Francisco.

EAPA ENDORSES NTC'S PRINCIPLES OF CARE

As health care reform proceeds, the National Treatment Consortium
has been receiving endorsements of its "vision for quality care,"
formally adopted by the group last year as part of the lobbying effort
to make addiction treatment a core benefit. Most recently, the
Employee Assistance Professionals Association has signed on to the
principles, which are based on "building bridges," in the words of
NTC executive vice president Jeffrey Kramer. "A partnership needs
to be established for a viable, effective, efficient system of care,"
Kramer told SAR.

The principles which are incorporated in the NTC's "vision" have
been sent to Congress, to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and to others
involved in trying to keep treatment available and accessible. The
endorsement of EAPA expands the vision beyond that of treatment
providers into the workplace. The principles are listed below.

1.We Are in the Business to Save Lives

We no longer can afford to perpetuate systems that primarily serve to
maintain their own existence. This occurs in both the public and
private sector and exists among all factions of the health care purchase
and delivery system. We need to create a system that has the prime
objective of building healthy productive lifestyles.

2.Speak the Same Language

Universal operational definition of medical necessity and patient
placement criteria are needed to effectively work together. Such
criteria must require ongoing evaluation and field testing and the
development process must include the perspective of payers,
purchasers and providers. We need to continue to promote ideas that
focus on consensus and common concerns and serve to bring all the
factions of the health care system on the same level playing field.
Specifically, managed care and treatment providers need to have the
same regulations in managing and providing care.

3.Alcoholism and Drug Addiction is a Disease

This is a fundamental mandate and it is our responsibility to provide
clear straightforward information to the general public on the
biopsychosocial elements of the disease.

4.Implement Models for a Continuum of Care

We must build bridges between the efforts to educate, prevent,
intervene and treat addiction. Educational efforts should increase the
understanding of the biopsychosocial aspects of the disease and the
difference between having the disease of addiction and abusing alcohol
and other drugs. Prevention activities should include a focus on the
biomedical features of addiction and, when early signs of the disease
surface in the community, efforts should be made to promote early
intervention and treatment. Intervention and treatment must improve
their quality. They must be able to serve more people who need
treatment at a reasonable cost while at the same time ensure that the
services provided have the desired effect.

5.Include Primary Health Care in the Efforts of Early Detection,
Intervention, and Treatment of Addiction

It is necessary to include physicians, nurses and other primary health
care professionals to assist in early detection, intervention and
treatment of addiction.

6.Research Efforts Must Explore Causes of Addiction

Research initiatives should be directed to identify the biopsychosocial
causes of the disease. An effective partnership must be developed
between the research and service provider communities to apply
research findings and work together to develop effective diagnostic and
treatment tools to improve the quality of care. Any partnership
between the science and the service communities could also serve to
develop innovative treatment models that are effective with patients
who do not recover using traditional approaches.

7.Public Policies Should Emphasize These Principles

Addiction is a public health problem, and more support is needed to
effectively educate about, prevent, intervene with, and treat it. The
federal government should adopt the fundamental mandate in
developing its policies and help create effective models of care. To
begin the process, federal funding for demand reduction should be
given priority status equal to that given to supply reduction. Second,
more priority should be placed on funding research that examines
causes and cures of addiction. Third, policies should be developed to
broaden access to treatment, including those encouraging
public/private treatment partnerships.

8.Create Incentives to Work Together

Payers, purchasers and providers need to see the value in building
bridges and working together to create effective and efficient models
of care. We must create systems that integrate effective and efficient
ways of managing costs while at the same time providing the most
appropriate level of care. The value of the health care dollar is a
balance between efficiency and efficacy.

9.Use Quality Improvement Techniques

Payers, purchasers and providers must serve the best interests of the
patient. Quality improvement techniques can improve the efficiency
and efficacy of paying for, purchasing and providing treatment. We
should promote the use of quality improvement in managing and
providing care, as well as quality improvement in developing an
organized system of working together.

10.Build Bridges with the Medical and Mental Health Communities

Invite the medical and mental health communities to adopt the tenets
listed above and join us in the effort to improve the quality of
treatment.

Treatment Consortium, 444 North Capitol Street, Suite 642,
Washington, DC 20001; (202)434-4783.

GATF RELEASES LONG-AWAITED SKILLS STANDARDS

The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) released the
first two long-awaited books from the National Skills
Standards Project.

The Skill Standards Project was initiated in 1992 to develop
skill standards for education and training for the printing
industry. The first two standards, one on prepress/imaging,
and one on press, are now available. The finishing and
distribution skill standard will be available shortly.

Forty industry representatives of graphic arts firms,
associations, union, and education were members of the Project
Policy Committee that directed the project. Over 1,200
industry practitioners from throughout the U.S. spent hundreds
of hours developing and validating the standards.

This Skills Standards Project was funded by the U.S.
Department of Education (DOE). One half of the $516,127 grant
was received at the start of the project in 1992, while the
balance was funded by the DOE in March of 1994.

The skill standards grants were originally launched by the
Bush Administration. The Clinton Administration then included
the skill standards project as-a key part of its Goals 2000
initiative act which was signed into law in March of 1994.
The legislation includes provisions to establish a National
Skill Standards Board to oversee the implementation of
voluntary industry-based skill standards.

Initially, the printing industry was only one of seven
industries designated for a skills study of such magnitude,
but since the GATF project began, funding has been made
available to fifteen additional industries by the DOE and the
Department of Labor (DOL). Some of the other industries
include travel and tourism, computer-aided drafting,
biotechnical sciences, health science and technology,
electronics, retail trade, and metalworking.

The skills standards are available for sale for $20 each, or
you may order all three standards for $49. To order copies,
please contact the GATF Order Department at 412/621-6941. You
may also send requests by fax to 412/621-6598, or by mail to
4615 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

SKILLS STANDARDS BROCHURE AVAILABLE FROM GATF

A brochure detailing the just-released National Skill
Standards is available from the Graphic Arts Technical
Foundation (GATF).

The brochure contains an order form for the three national
skill standards books. The books on prepress/imaging, Press,
and Finishing and Distribution were released during Graph
Expo'95. The three standards books may be ordered separately
for $20 each, or $49 for all three books.

In 1992, GATF launched a three-year project to develop
world-class standards for business and education/training in
the graphic communications industries, which was funded by the
U.S. Department of Education (DOE) and by members of the
industry.

You may receive a copy of the brochure by sending your
request by fax to the GATF Marketing Department at

GENETIC WORKSTATION INTRODUCED BY VYSIS

Integrating various applications of cytogenetics and
karyotyping just became easier with the introduction of the
QUIPS Genetic Workstation from Vysis Inc., of Downers Grove,
IL. For research use in karyotyping, chromosomal evaluation,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses, the new integrated
system comprises a multitude of tools and optimized reagents
designed to easily capture, enhance, analyze and print high-
quality images.

The QUIPS Genetic Workstation allows researchers to visualize
fluorescent signals under a high-powered fluorescence
microscope. With a simple point and click, the user can
capture and resolve even closely spaced probe signals. The
system combines a high-performance, digital charged-couple
device (CCD) camera with powerful imaging software to permit
acquisition and analysis of even the weakest signals.
Resolution of the Photometrics CCD camera approaches the
theoretical maximum for light.

QUIPS configurations and tools include QUIPS-FISH, QUIPS-CGH,
QUIPS-AKS, and QUIPS-ACES.

The QUIPS-FISH system utilizes scientific grade CCD cameras
for unsurpassed spatial resolution and sensitivity with a wide
range of FISH probes and reagents. The system is equipped with
a complete set of filters and automation for most FISH imaging
needs, including Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH).
Featuring flexible text and graphic layout, QUIPS-FISH offers
accurate, high-resolution printing using dye sublimation
printers for a result that nears photographic quality.

Vysis offers a wide range of FISH probes and reagents
optimized for use with QUIPS-FISH instrumentation and filters.
Vysis CEP Chromosome Enumerator Probes, WCP Whole Chromosome
Paints, and LSI Loci-Specific Identifiers are powerful tools
for enumerating chromosomes in interphase or metaphase
preparations, identifying translocations, or determining other
chromosomal anomalies.

Vysis has designed the QUIPS Comparative Genomic Hybridization
(CGH) System to capture, analyze, visualize and produce rapid
quantitative interpretation and reports of CGH results in one
integrated unit. With CGH used more frequently now as a
powerful in situ hybridization tool for whole genomic DNA
analysis, accurate amplification of the ratio profile of two
fluorescent signals has gained in importance.

The system provides statistical interpretation of the ratio
profile information for quantitative comparison with control
data. In addition, it provides results-oriented automation and
integration of DAPI-banded karyotyping in a flexible data
format. Project management capabilities using a centralized
directory and near photographic quality output complete the
QUIPS-CGH System.

The QUIPS Automated Karyotyping System (AKS) automates the
process of capturing, enhancing, classifying and printing
high-quality images of chromosomes prearranged in a variety or
user-selected karyogram formats. QUIPS-AKS replaces 35mm
photography, darkroom processing and manual cutting and
pasting of chromosomes. The system provides auto-
classification of chromosomes and karyotyping of C, R, Q and
DAPI-banded chromosomes, managed by a centralized directory
for project management. The system simplifies results
reporting and provides near photographic quality high-
resolution accurate prints.

The QUIPS Automated Chromosomal Evaluation System (ACES)
increases throughput by scanning a slide and assessing
multiple gene probes in different colors within nuclei. An
example of the QUIPS ACES is counting human chromosomes in
amniocytes for ploidy status as related to genetic diseases.
The system automatically scans slides, isolates nuclei, and
counts multiple color signals to provide an easily interpreted
statistical result. Reliable unattended operation and rapid
image-acquisition and transfer increase the efficiency of the
cytogenetics laboratory, allowing technician time for other
required tasks. Vysis has designed the QUIPS ACES for future
expansion with additional assays and multiple slide
capabilities.

MANUFACTURERS MUST PROACTIVELY PLAN FOR CHANGE

Manufacturing Automation  underscores that manufacturers should
strive to continuously plan and reengineer their business processes
to successfully apply innovative technologies and thereby address
the evolving demands and expectations of their customers.

The Sixth Annual Grant Thornton Survey of American Manufacturers
Report , sponsored by Grant Thornton LLP (Chicago, IL, 312-856-
0200) and based on interviews with key executives at US
manufacturing companies with annual sales from $10 million-$500
million, addresses several issues that will impact manufacturers'
success or failure as they approach the millennium: strategic
planning; information technology; financial management; and
international expansion.

"No company today can escape the forces of change," asserts Michael
N. Cantwell, Grant Thornton's national director for manufacturing and
partner in charge of the study. "This holds true not only for the
world's industrial and retail powerhouses, but for midsize
manufacturers, which often supply materials, components, or
finished product to the biggest companies. While technology is an
enabler, it is not the solution unless companies engage in meaningful
business planning and processes." The following are among the
study's key findings.

Quality and customer service remain the two most competitive
factors for US manufacturers. Executives are twice as likely to cite as
reasons for their success either high-quality products (38%) or
superior service (33%) rather than cost-efficiency (17%) or rapid
product development (12%). However, the report states that speed
and agility will ultimately become a vital requirement for midsize

manufacturers, as their major customers move toward "mass
customization"--a made-to-order strategy offering greater product
options for the mass market. To realize this goal, 78% of midsize
companies are reducing product cycle times by streamlining product
design or reducing the number of component parts.

A clear majority (87%) of midsize companies have reengineered at
least one business process, most often in the production area (72%);
and 40% of the manufacturers rate the results of their reengineering
efforts as outstanding or excellent.

The majority of midsize manufacturers describe as average their
companies' use of technology in a variety of areas. However, 52%
plan to spend nearly an average of $500,000 in 1995 on new
systems, software, and telecommunications equipment. Despite the
availability of various techniques and technologies for enhancing
inventory management, 40% of midsize manufacturers report their
inventories are higher than they were two years ago. Most say
higher stocks are required to meet customer demands for rapid
response.

In the wake of various regional and global trade agreements, 72%
indicate they will place higher emphasis on developing foreign
markets for their products through such means as exporting and
joint ventures. Moreover, 72% of the companies that are pursuing or
plan to receive ISO 9000 certification report they will do so because
their customers expect or require it.

Sincerely,
Peter Adrian, Editor

MCAD/CAM, CAE SOFTWARE MARKET TOPS $2.5 BILLION IN 1995

Worldwide revenues for mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software will
expand at a scintillating 18.2% rate in 1995 to exceed $2.5 billion,
compared to over $2.1 billion in 1994, according to Daratech, Inc.
(Cambridge, MA, 617-354-2339). (See Figure 1).

The growth in the CAD/CAM, CAE software arena is being propelled
by a strengthening global economy, fueling capital investment by
manufacturing firms. Simultaneously, flagship software products
from many major vendors are generating sanguine demand from
customers in various geographical regions. Many of the products
have benefited from significant technology renewal and functional
enhancements in such areas as solids and assembly modeling,
EDM/PDM integration, and ease of use. Such products now appear
capable of realizing the visions promised by their developers, and
are gaining the confidence of users. Therefore, manufacturing firms
seeking to improve their design and manufacturing productivity and
boost their global competitiveness, are adapting these products in
record numbers.

Global mechanical CAE software revenues are forecast to increase
14.4% in 1995 to reach $355 million, from $310 million in 1994. The
growth in the MCAE software segment is driven by the efforts of
major analysis software vendors, such as MacNeal-Schwendler and
ANSYS, to transcend the engineering analysis market and penetrate
the much broader design engineering arena. Moreover, such vendors
are working to enable closed-loop design optimization by furnishing

bidirectional associativity between their analysis tools and leading
CAD software products.

For example, Parametric Technology Corporation (Waltham, MA)
plans to tighten the integration of Pro/ENGINEER with its recently
acquired MECHANICA design optimization software over the next
several Pro/E release cycles, with the aim of achieving full
bidirectional associativity. EDS Unigraphics (Maryland Heights, MO)
and MacNeal-Schwendler have partnered to deliver "closed-loop
associativity" between CAD/CAM and CAE software for Unigraphics
and MSC/NASTRAN users. SDRC (Milford, OH) has long emphasized
the high level of integration between the modeling and analysis
functions within its I-DEAS suite of design and analysis software.

Parametric Technology is projected to be the growth leader in 1995
among the leading mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software suppliers. The
company's mechanical software revenues are forecast to grow 43.2%
to $313.9 million in1995, compared to $219.2 million in 1994, as it
rapidly gains ground on IBM, which remains in first place.
Parametric is forecast to be the number three software supplier in
the mechanical CAE arena in 1995, as a result of its acquisition of
Rasna Corporation and the latter's MECHANICA product line for
mechanical design synthesis. Parametric's MCAE software revenues
are projected to exceed $31.4 million in 1995, representing a
spectacular 86.3% increase over the estimated revenues of $17.1
million for MECHANICA in 1994.

Among the key factors driving Parametric's growth in 1995 and
1996 are the aggressive expansion of the company's worldwide sales

organization, accelerating sales of its flagship Pro/ENGINEER
software, and robust product sales in all major geographic areas. The
sales growth is also being spearheaded by what Parametric perceives
as a global trend among manufacturers to invest in tools and
technologies to increase productivity and capture a competitive
advantage.

IBM/Dassault Systemes (Armonk, NY/Suresnes, France) is expected
to be the premier supplier of mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in
1995, as its mechanical revenues derived from sales of CATIA and
CADAM software increase 27% in 1995 to $410.4 million, compared
to $323.1 million in 1994. IBM/Dassault notes that the growth in
CATIA sales in 1995 and continuing into 1996 will be fueled by such
key factors as Dassault's increased technical and marketing support
of IBM's North American sales force with respect to CATIA, success
in major automotive accounts, and increased revenue contribution
from the Asia/Pacific region.

Market acceptance of CATIA has increased, as the product's
competitive strengths have markedly improved over the past 18
months, according to IBM/Dassault. The product's new architecture
allows CATIA developer Dassault to deliver software upgrades every
four months; and the company says the processes are now in place to
meet this aggressive release schedule. Dassault reports that Release
4.1.5 of CATIA is the fifth major product release in 18 months, and
increases the total number of CATIA products by 60% over the
previous release. Dassault expects that frequent product upgrades
will allow for more rapid enhancement of CATIA's functionality
across a broad range of applications, thereby enhancing the product's

competitive position.

IBM/Dassault also reports expanding market acceptance of CATIA on

Hewlett-Packard workstations, with about 50 customers having thus
far installed CATIA on HP hardware, many of them new CATIA
accounts.

Autodesk, Inc. (San Rafael, CA), the projected leader in overall 1995
CAD/CAM, CAE software revenue, is forecast to be the number three
supplier of mechanical software, as its mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE
segment revenues increase 20.4% in 1995 to $230.5 million,
compared to $191.5 million in 1994. The company reports that
upgrade revenue from AutoCAD Release 13 has driven a significant
portion of its growth in 1995, along with incremental sales of
AutoCAD to new customers. Sales of Autodesk's Workcenter
EDM/PDM software and data publishing products are also expected to
contribute to the company's software growth in 1995.

Autodesk's Mechanical Desktop offering, announced in September
1995 and slated for shipment in late 1995 or early 1996, is
characterized by the company as heralding its most aggressive push
into the mechanical market. Autodesk's mechanical revenue growth
in 1996 will likely be driven by sales of this product, and third-party

applications provided by the company's dozen Mechanical
Applications Initiative partners. Autodesk notes that the partners
will deliver a range of complementary, fully integrated applications
for analysis through manufacturing that will possess the same look
and feel as Mechanical Desktop.

The forecast is based on Autodesk's November 6, 1995
announcement that its net revenues for the quarter ending October
31, 1995 will be lower than anticipated due to weak sales in Asia
Pacific and Latin America, slower than expected upgrade revenue
from AutoCAD Release 13, and an unfavorable currency impact due
to fluctuations in the US dollar. The company believes such factors
will persist into the fourth quarter, but is optimistic that the launch
of several new products late in the quarter and in the following
quarter will drive revenue growth in 1996. Before the
announcement, Autodesk's mechanical software revenues were
forecast to rise 26.7% to $242.6 million.

Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) is projected to be
the sixth-ranked supplier of mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in
1995, with its mechanical software revenues growing 20.4% to
$134.1 million, compared to $11.4 million in 1994, reflecting user
acceptance of the latest version of I-DEAS Master Series, Release 2.1.
The company, moreover, is projected to be the number two supplier
of mechanical CAE software, as its MCAE software revenues expand
20% in 1995 to $37.5 million, compared to $31.3 million in 1994.

SDRC reports its software growth in 1995 and into '96 will be
propelled by greater use and integration of EDM/PDM with
CAD/CAM, CAE software, a more highly leveraged and expanded
distribution model, and support of its flagship solids modeling
software on Windows NT platforms. The company, which is currently
shipping I-DEAS Master Series software for Windows NT/Intel-based
systems, also anticipates boosting its revenues by gaining more
repeat business from its existing customer base.

EDS Unigraphics is projected to be the fifth leading supplier of
mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in 1995, increasing its
mechanical software revenues 14.9% to $199.4 million, compared to
$173.5 million in 1994. The company reports that the trend toward
performing large-scale, complex design and manufacturing work
among large manufacturing companies is providing it with a plethora
of sales opportunities in the area of CAD/CAM, CAE, EDM/PDM  and
related implementation services. EDS UG expects other groups within
EDS to provide the Unigraphics division with a heightened level of
such opportunities in the near future. An additional factor driving
EDS UG's software growth in 1995 is the recovery of the automotive
and aerospace industries, which account for a large share of the
company's business.

Computervision Corporation (Bedford, MA) is forecast to be the
fourth-ranked mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software provider in 1995,
with its mechanical software revenues rising 10% to $215.6 million,
compared to $196.0 million in 1994. Moreover, CV is projected to be
the number five supplier of mechanical CAE software in 1995,
increasing its MCAE revenues 10% to $32.3 million, compared to
$29.4 million in 1994. Throughout much of 1995, CV maintained its
focus on cost reduction and profitability, while expanding their core

mechanical software and services business.

Closing major sales opportunities will be a key factor enabling
Computervision to meet or exceed projected revenue increase in
1995. CV's growth will also be fueled by a expanding number of sales

opportunities in CAD/CAM and EDM/PDM, and by the company's
implementation of its electronic product definition (EPD) strategy for
helping major manufacturers achieve concurrent engineering, digital
product development, and total product life-cycle management.
Revenues derived from applications based on CV's Pelorus product
architecture are also expected to contribute to the company's
software revenue growth.

Prominent manufacturers from North America, Europe, and the
Pacific Rim will convene in Boston, Massachusetts on March 4-6,
1996 to hear CEOs from the CAD/CAM, CAE and EDM/PDM industry,
including Steven Walske, Chairman & CEO, Parametric Technology
Corporation; James Meadlock, Chairman & CEO of Intergraph
Corporation; Russell Planitzer, Chairman & CEO, Computervision
Corporation; Bernard Charles, president, Dassault Systemes S.A., and
others explain their companies' strategies for computer-aided
engineering and manufacturing.

The discussions, which are part of Daratech's CAD/CAM, CAE and
EDM/PDM Strategy Workshops '96, will focus on how users should
update, revalidate, or completely reformulate their CAD/CAM, CAE
and EDM strategies to conform to contemporary technological and
business realities. This requirement has increasingly pressing in the
light of the significant advances in technology and the emergence of
the Internet and EDM/PDM as major factors impacting end-users'
CAD/CAM, CAE strategies.

PDM CONFERENCE '96 WILL HELP CONTROL PRODUCT DATA AND
DOCUMENTS

CIMdata's sixth annual PDM Conference, regarded as a major event in
the rapidly-expanding Product Data Management (PDM) industry,
will be held April 9-11, 1996 in Boca Raton, FL. The conference is
expected to attract nearly 1,000 delegates and more than 30
suppliers of PDM-related systems and services.

PDM Conference '96 will focus on the ways organizations use PDM to
control vast quantities of swiftly changing product data and
documents, thereby improving information flow, collaboration among
functional groups, and the speed of bringing products to the
marketplace. Exhibits of commercial systems by leading PDM
suppliers will be featured throughout the conference, which will
consist of one day of tutorials followed by two days of conference
sessions.

The conference agenda includes discussions of PDM system selection
and implementation, integration issues, user experiences, technology
and industry trends, multi-industry applications, quality support
efforts, certification requirements, and configuration management.
The cost is US$895 for the two-day conference, and an additional
US$400 for the one-day tutorials.

PDM serves as a tool to help engineers and others manage data as
well as the product development process. Systems keep track of the
reams of data and information required to design, build, support,
distribute, and maintain products. Encompassing the repertoire of
systems that manage product definition information, PDM is a
general extension of a wide range of techniques frequently referred
to as engineering data management (EDM), document management,
product information management (PIM), technical data management
(TDM), technical information management (TIM), image management,
etc.

Ed Miller, CIMdata's president, notes that the information managed
by PDM includes electronic documents, digital files, and database
records. "This type of product information usually pertains to
manufactured items, such as automobiles, aircraft, office equipment,
consumer products, and home appliances," Miller explains. "Other
industries also apply the technology in a more general sense of the
term 'product' so that PDM reaches across a broad expanse of
enterprises. Some of these include projects in the construction
industry, such as buildings and highways, oil refineries and other
types of process plants, complex facilities including airports and
warehouses, and distribution networks for electrical, gas, and other

utilities."

The global PDM market is forecast to expand at about a 33% annual
rate to reach about $636 million in 1995, compared to $478 million
in 1994, according to CIMdata.

TELEDYNE BROWN GARNERS GRANT TO DEVELOP NEW LASER TOOLS
TECHNOLOGY

Teledyne Brown Engineering has received a US Commerce
Department grant for cross-shared funding for optics technology
research and development. Teledyne Brown and Utilase Systems
(Detroit, MI) joined SDL, Inc. (San Jose, CA) to develop technology for
a new generation of laser-based cutting and welding tools that are
more versatile, less bulky, and less expensive to purchase and
operate than those currently available. The new technology promises
to enable laser-based materials processing to penetrate considerably
more manufacturing niches in the automotive assembly line.

Led by SDL, the team is one of 44 selected in five key technology
areas for the Commerce Department's annual Advanced Technology
Program (ATP) Awards--a program designed to catalyze economic
expansion and job creation. The ATP supports strategic, high-risk
research in cutting-edge technologies; and awards projects based on
their scientific and technical merit and potential benefit to the US
economy.

The team received one of 15 awards presented in the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturing Technology category. Teledyne Brown's role entails
developing optical systems to enhance the performance and
efficiency of lasers in material processing systems, thereby reducing
costs for US automobile manufacturers.

"SDL's decision to select Teledyne Brown Engineering as a major
contributor to this effort is an acknowledgment of our leadership in
the field of micro-optics," declared Paul Fileger, Teledyne Brown's
manager of electro-optics. "The ATP award demonstrates not only
the significance of our technology, but is evidence of the trend
toward laser-based systems i material processing."

The team members will receive nearly $3.6 million to match
company funding for research and development of the new laser
tools. The Department of Commerce committed over $188 million
through the Advanced Technology Program in 1995.

Bruce Peters, production manager, Electrooptics Products Group at
Teledyne Brown told Manufacturing Automation  that the overall
system developed by the researchers will use the brightness and
modularity of an array of laser diodes to replace CO2 and Nd:YAG
lasers in welding and cutting applications. The advantages of such
laser diodes include reduced costs and enhanced longevity. SDL will
provide the laser diodes and system packaging; and Utilase, which
supplies laser-based systems for machining and welding applications,
will provide the parameters and system requirements necessary for
satisfying customers.

Teledyne Brown will work with SDL on aligning an array of micro
lenses (that are on the order of several hundred microns in
diameter) with an array of laser diodes used in the system.
According to Peters, the first building block of the overall system will
be demonstrated by the end of 1996. The modular building block
will consist of a laser diodes or an array of diodes, an optical system,
and fixturing. With more than 40 years of experience in supplying
optical products and systems for the Defense Department, Teledyne
Brown (Huntsville, AL, 205-726-2429) has developed a
comprehensive range of optical products with broad commercial
applications.

Demand for laser diodes in the US is forecast to rise at a 7.6% annual
rate to reach $140 million in 2000, from $90 million in 1994,
according to The Freedonia Group, Inc.'s (Cleveland, OH, 216-921-
6800) Flat Screen Displays & Other Optoelectronics  report (#728).

Global revenues for laser machine tools are forecast to increase at a
7.1% compound annual rate to approach $1.3 billion in 1999,
compared to $803.1 million in 1992, according to Frost & Sullivan's
World Standard and Special Machine Tool Markets  report (920-10).
Revenues for 1996-1998 are placed at about $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion,
and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of laser machine tools are projected to
rise at an 8.7% compound annual rate to total 3,941 in 1999, from
2,193 in 1992. Unit shipments during 1996-1999 are pegged at
2,986, 3,268, and 3,589, respectively.

In 1996, the projected distribution of the total laser machine tool
revenues by product type is: CO2 lasers-64.0%; and Nd:YAG-36.0%.
The projected distribution in 1999 is: CO2-62.7%; and Nd:YAG-37.3%.

Revenues for the US laser machine tools market are forecast to
expand at a 6.8% compound annual rate to reach $264.9 million in
1999, as opposed to $167.5 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996-1998
are projected at $212.9 million, $228.0 million, and $245.5 million,

respectively.

In 1996, the projected end-user industry distribution of the total
revenues for the laser machine tools market is (all figures are
rounded): automotive-37.0%; industrial/electrical machinery and
equipment (I/EME)-22.4%; aerospace/defense-20.8%; and "other"
(including medical equipment and precision instrument suppliers,
shipbuilding, and railroads)-19.9%. In 1999, the distribution will be:

automotive-37.9%; I/EME-21.3%; aerospace/defense-20.5%; and
"other"-20.3%.

Revenues for the worldwide automotive industry market for laser
machine tools are forecast to advance at a 7.9% compound annual
rate to reach $491.6 million in 1999, from $289.2 million in 1992.
Revenues for 1996-1998 are put at $384.9 million, $416.7 million,
and $453.2 million, respectively.

BERKELEY SCIENTISTS DISCOVER NEW MR MATERIALS

Scientists at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory's Molecular Design Institute (Berkeley, CA, 510-486-
6249) have used combinational synthesis--a strategy developed at
the Lab for making and testing many complex metal materials in
parallel--to discover new magnetoresistive (MR) compounds; e.g.,
materials whose electrical conductivity changes in a magnetic field. A
US Department of Energy national laboratory managed by the
University of California, the Berkeley Lab conducts unclassified
scientific research.

Berkeley Lab researchers Xiao-Dong Xiang, Peter Schultz (who is also
a professor of chemistry at UC Berkeley) et. al. published their
findings in the October 13 issue of Science. The researchers initially

described their combinational technique for discovering new solid-
state materials with novel physical or chemical properties--
particularly their methodology allowing for the parallel synthesis of
spacially addressable arrays containing superconducting copper
oxide thin films--in the June 23 issue of Science.

"The technique is a powerful way to examine a broad base of
advanced materials," Xiang explained. "Magnetoresistant materials
are just the first."

Combinational synthesis (involving thin-film deposition and physical
masking techniques) purportedly enables materials scientists to
create thousands of complex materials in the time it typically takes
to create one. In the technique, materials are laid down in a
checkerboard arrangement, as thin squares arranged in a grid.
Different metal ingredients are stenciled onto the grid through cut-
out "masks." Each square in the grid receives a different combination
of metals, owing to the different cut-outs used for each ingredient.

Heat treatment mixes the ingredients and creates a grid of stable
compounds--a "combinatorial library." The materials can be scanned
for interesting electrical properties with a matched set of contact
pins. Xiang and Schultz have demonstrated that they can put as
many as 10,000 different hi-tech materials into a single square-inch
library.

The MR compounds in the study are members of a class of materials
known as perovskite oxides--conductive metal crystals comprised of
complex ratios of four to six metal atoms. Their many-atom structure
renders them especially suited for combinational study. Interesting
materials in such classes are generally discovered by substituting
atoms in an already known compound or changing the ratios of the
existing atoms. Using a combinatorial strategy, scientists can look at
many atom substitutions and ratio adjustments in a single
combinatorial library.

To search for new materials with magnetoresistance, the researchers
began with a well-studied class of MR materials based on manganese
oxide. They substituted similar elements from the periodic table--
iron, vanadium, and cobalt--for manganese, and made a separate
combinatorial library for each one. The researchers achieved success
with the cobalt oxide library, which yielded 26 new MR materials.
Such materials showed resistance changes as high as 72%, rendering
the cobalt oxides similar to the so-called "colossal" class of MR
materials. Colossal MR materials lose a great deal of their resistance
in magnetic fields, some as much as 99.99%.

Although the phenomenon is still not well understood, scientists
suspect that magnetoresistance is associated with a physical
characteristic known as spin polarization, which affects how electrons
can be passed back and forth between neighboring atoms. Atoms
with similar spin polarizations are much more likely to transfer
electrons between one another than those with different spin
polarizations. It is thought that magnetism aligns the spin
polarization in MR materials, thereby allowing electrons to jump
more freely between atoms, causing the resistance in a material to
decrease.

Previously, combinatorial approaches have been used successfully by
researchers in the life sciences who have searched for potential
drugs by screening vast libraries of protein combinations. Xiang and
Schultz are purportedly the first to apply the philosophy to solid-
state materials.

Xiang told Manufacturing Automation  that the new MR materials
could potentially be used in disk drive sensor heads, as well as in
other types of sensors to detect magnetic fields. He adds that colossal
MR materials have potential for considerably enhancing the
sensitivity of magnetic sensors and increasing the areal density of
memory devices.

Civilian, open global demand for magnetic field sensors are forecast
to increase at a 3.9% average annual rate during 1991-2001 to reach
828.1 mil. DM (about $552.1 million at the exchange rate of 1.50 DM
for the dollar) in 2001, compared to 565.3 mil. DM (about $376.9
million) in 1991 and 679.2 mil. DM (about $452.8 million) in 1996,
according to Intechno Consulting AG's (Basel, Switzerland) Sensor
Markets 2001  report. An updated version of the report is now
available.

In 1996, the application area distribution of the total civilian, open
magnetic field sensor market is: professional instruments-92.0 mil.
DM (about $61.3 million); consumer electronics-299.2 mil. DM (about
$199.5 million); and EDP office equipment-288.0 mil. DM (about
$192.0 million). VIP's monthly Sensor Business Digest  newsletter
provides in-depth information on key established and emerging
sensor markets, products, technologies, and applications.

EFFICIENT ION BEAM PULSING TECHNOLOGY COULD ENERGIZE KEY
MARKETS

Spearheaded by Technology Ventures Corporation (Albuquerque,
NM, 505-246-2882), Quantum Manufacturing, Inc. (Albuquerque,
NM, 505-881-4121) has received a $4.2 million equity investment
from Rainbow Technologies, Inc. (Irvine, CA). The financing
agreement, signed in September, affords the opportunity to
implement QMI's plan to build a commercial prototype system and
begin validation studies with customers. Quantum's high energy
pulsed ion beam technology for efficient, low-cost surface treatment
of materials was developed by two Sandia National Laboratories

scientists--Regan Stinnett and Eugene Neau--who, with assistance
from Technology Ventures, formed QMI.

"It's amazing to us," Stinnett exclaimed. "And, while we have to give
credit to many people, including the management at the labs for
their encouragement, none of it would have been possible without
Technology Ventures Corporation. They were the key to the
commercialization process."

"We are proud to be part of this success," stated Sherman McCorkle,
president of Technology Ventures. "We believe it represents the best
efforts of our staff and the best and highest use of our resources."
Technology Ventures Corp. is a non-profit organization dedicated to

successfully commercializing technology from Sandia National
Laboratories. In operation for slightly more than two years, the
company has already assisted in the successful transfer of more than
a half-dozen such technologies, thereby offering a vital link for the
lab's scientists and engineers to the business and investment world.

'Technology Ventures is a true innovation in the world of technology

commercialization," declared Paul Robinson, Sandia Laboratories'
president and director. "Founded by Lockheed Martin Corporation as
a conduit for moving technology out of the labs and into the private
sector, this type of success demonstrates a breath and depth of
abilities that are more than enough to accomplish its goals." Stinnett
notes that Technology Ventures assisted the two entrepreneurs in
organizing the business effort from the ground up after recognizing
the significant commercial potential of the technology.

The chemical-free, commercial scale Ion Beam Surface Treatment
(IBEST) technology upon which QMI was formed uses repetitively
high average power pulsed ion beams to efficiently deposit energy in
the top 2-50 micrometers of the surface of a material, and was
developed at Sandia at a cost of more than $20 million. (See Figure
2). The technology, protected by six patents pending, uses short,
intense beams of ions to melt or treat metal, ceramic, glass, or plastic

surfaces in less than one millionth of a second. The controlled ion
deposition in a thin surface layer is followed by rapid cooling at up to
one billion degrees per second. As of mid-December 1995, QMI is
very close to completing negotiations with Sandia for the license to
IBEST technology.

QMI's rapid quenching technique--which uses a unique diode
designed by Cornell University for emitting the beam--has been used
to melt and resolidify metals and ceramics for various potential
industrial applications, including gear teeth for a major automotive

manufacturer. The process has demonstrated its ability to increase
the lifetime of tools by up to threefold, reduce corrosion of metals by
up to a factor of 100, polish and make surfaces nearly defect free,
and increase the bonding properties of plastic surfaces.

QMI's technology environmentally-friendly technology has potential
applications in many areas, including the tool-and-die industry,
aircraft manufacturing, automobile engines, medical implants and
tools, microelectronics fabrication, and even razor blades and
cookware.

A market analysis by KMPG Peat Marwick has confirmed the
attractiveness of the technology for the aircraft industry, tools and
dies, and polymer surfaces. For example, metal and ceramic dies can
range in cost from $5,000 to $50,000. Treating even the largest die
would cost less than a dollar, but could double its lifetime. Similar

advantages could be provided for hardware utilized in such
application areas as automobile engines, microelectronics fabrication,
and aerospace. QMI's technology costs only a few cents per square
foot in high process rate applications.

"We look for 'root' technologies--those that have many applications,
that provide the greatest impact," noted Bob Gibson, Technology
Ventures' director of equity funding who spearheaded the business
development effort for Stinnett and Neau. "This technology is
definitely a root technology. It has many applications. It can be
applied to high-value items, such as hardening an artificial joint used
in hip replacements. Right now, such a joint may last 10 years before

replacement. With this technology, it could last up to 30 years. It can
also be used in a variety of high-volume applications, and in the
future may even have uses in the purification and pasteurization of
food."

Fueled by such potential, Technology Ventures helped the scientists
form QMI and develop a business plan that would "make a business
out of the technology," Stinnett commented. Technology Ventures
helped the pair identify markets, map out a strategy that would
attract investors, and then introduced them to the investors
themselves.

Gibson introduced the scientists to a dozen qualified investors, many
of which attended Technology Ventures' Equity Capital Symposium
last May in Albuquerque. The introductions resulted in four written
offers, and QMI selected the deal with Rainbow Technologies.
"Technology Ventures kept us out of shark-infested waters," Stinnett
explained. "Because of them, we were able to hook up with the right
kind of investors."

"Rainbow is a qualified equity investor," Gibson noted. "This means
they have a long-term interest in the technology and in the company.
And, Rainbow is itself a solid technology company with an 11-year
history and a strong cash position. Currently, their main product is in

software security."

QMI represents an "outstanding investment opportunity," stated
Walter Straub, Rainbow's CEO and president. "We are excited about
the opportunity to invest in a company and technology with such
significant commercial potential."

Technology Ventures--which screens such opportunities as carefully
for the investment community as it screens investors for its

companies--encouraged Rainbow to pay close attention to QMI. In
the earlier stages of the commercialization process, Technology
Ventures helped incubate QMI by providing free office space and
related services, and contributing $10,000 in seed funding.

"But, we got a lot more than money and office space from them,"
Stinnett highlighted. "When we had to move quickly, to keep
investment interest alive, Technology Ventures helped us do that.
They started working with us in March, and now we have a complete
package, complete with financing. We wouldn't have been even close
without Technology Ventures."

However, Gibson credits the scientists for their willingness to enter
the business fray. "The toughest part of finding money is finding
people who are willing to do the things an investor needs to complete
the due diligence process. Stinnett and Neau have been a total joy to
work with. Not only are they world-class scientists, they have an
extraordinary commitment to making the business work."

Stinnett told Manufacturing Automation  that Rainbow has provided
QMI with seed funding to complete the process of obtaining a license
for the technology, and that Rainbow is committed to provide
funding to bring the technology to the commercialization stage.
According to Gibson, it is anticipated that there will be a series of
field use licenses for the technology. Such technology is available
through QMI as a package, including an exclusive global license to the
entire technology, the scientists who developed it, and OEMs who can

manufacture the required subsystems.

The value of worldwide shipments of polymers for surface
modification is forecast to increase at an 11.2% average annual rate
to exceed $3.1 billion in 1998, compared to over $1.8 billion in 1993,

according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'s Surface
Modification of Polymers  report (K4P-214). Ion implanted and ion
beam assisted deposition are expected to account for 13.4% of all
surface treatment techniques by 1998. The value-added through all
surface modification technologies is projected to increase at a 5.9%
average annual rate to reach $724.5 million in 1998, from $543.8
million in 1993.

KPMG PEAT MARWICK AND UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE TO SURVEY
LOGISTICS TRENDS

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (New York, NY) and the University of
Tennessee's Department of Marketing, Logistics and Transportation
(Knoxville, TN) will partner to broaden and deepen the scope of
KPMG's annual logistics benchmarking survey. The alliance will
furnish in-depth information concerning key trends in logistics to
businesses contemplating revamping their logistics processes.

The two organizations will begin the design and methodology of the
survey this month. During the past three years, KPMG has surveyed
about 300 companies to benchmark logistics operations. With the
alliance, plans call for expanding the survey to encompass several
thousand manufacturing and retail companies, allowing for a more
comprehensive view of logistics planning and trends.

Tom Mentzer, Bruce Excellence Chair of Business Policy at the
University of Tennessee, notes that the research will scrutinize the
main trends impacting business planning for logistics, including the
affect of technology on logistics (e.g., how technology has improved
the capability of businesses to track orders and control distribution).

An example of technology's impact on logistics is the ability of
companies to track shipments and packages. Ten years ago, it could
require up to 20 days to receive and send a shipment, let alone track
its whereabouts. Using technology, companies can presently quickly
and easily track a package to within blocks of its location and
determine the precise time of arrival at its destination. Additional
trends the survey will examine include strategic alliances between

manufacturers and retailers that have enhanced the process of
inventory controls, and the new market opportunity for third-party
logistics services providers.

"We're looking forward to working with KPMG on this project,"
Mentzer stated. "We think the alliance of our world-class logistics
expertise and analysis capabilities with KPMG's real-world logistics
consulting knowledge and technology implementation experience will
result in a sophisticated, thorough benchmarking tool."

"We are very excited about working with the University of
Tennessee on the survey," commented Steve Gold, partner, KPMG's
national logistics practice. "The University is nationally recognized as
an innovative business school, and is renowned for its quality
logistics program."

When released in June, the survey results will be distributed to all

participants and available internationally. The survey will continue
to be viewed as a source and baseline for CIOs, CFOs and logistics,

information, and financial managers.

The University of Tennessee's logistics and transportation program,
the oldest such program in the US, was ranked second in the nation
by the Journal of Business Logistics.

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is the US practice of KPMG, which,
worldwide, has over 6,000 partners, as well as 67,000 professionals
servicing clients through 1,100 offices in 837 cities located in 134
countries. KPMG's National Logistics Consulting Practice focuses on
identifying and implementing logistics solutions throughout an
organization's supply chain. The Practice is comprised of experienced

professionals dedicated strictly to functional, operational, and
strategic logistics issues.

KPMG's core competencies in logistics cost reduction, warehousing
and distribution center systems, distribution strategy/site selection,

logistics systems, and activity-based management has made it a
leader in this expanding area of consulting expertise.

The Strategic Services Consulting unit of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP

LXE UNVEILS HANDHELD FUZZY LOGIC SCANNER

The new handheld fuzzy logic smart scanner from LXE, Inc. (Norcross,
GA, 404-447-4224) is designed for industrial environments where
barcodes tend to be of less than perfect quality, and for use with the

company's 6400, 6200, and 280 generation systems. When combined
with LXE's interference-resistant frequency hopping spread
spectrum radios and terminals, the ruggedized fuzzy logic scanner
delivers a superior solution for outdoor industrial data collection

applications, particularly in harsh environments.

The LS3603 (which has a base price of $1,495) is claimed to be the
first scanner with artificial intelligence for performing aggressive,
"smart" scanning by assessing the print quality of the barcode and
compensating for imperfections. The device also enhances barcode
images to improve working ranges on all symbols and offers optimal
read rates on poorly printed barcodes, low -contrast and high-
density bar codes, and dot matrix symbols.

LXE's fuzzy scanner eludes connectivity problems with built-in
communications for RS-232 and wand emulation interfaces. Other
interfaces are available with the use of a "smart cable" which
eliminates the need for a separate interface controller, rendering the
LS3603 easier to install, maintain, and use. The scanner is built to
work in very demanding environments, such as those with extreme
temperatures (-22 degrees  to 122 degrees  F/-30 degrees  to 50
degrees  C), and can withstand extreme humidity as well as repeated
six-foot drops onto concrete. The LS3603 incorporates a patented
Mylar scan element which resonates at a fixed frequency, thereby
creating motion without wear and tear for guaranteed durability.

Global revenues for barcode scanners are forecast to expand at a
13.7% compound annual rate to approach $1.8 billion in 2000,
compared to $730.6 million in 1993, according to Frost & Sullivan's
World Barcode Equipment Markets  report (5193-10). Revenues for
1996-1999 are pegged at about $1.0 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion,
and $1.6 billion, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of barcode scanners are projected to rise
at nearly a 15.6% compound annual rate to total about 6,600,000 in
2000, as opposed to about 2,800,000 in 1993. Unit shipments for
1996-1999 are placed at 3,900,000, 4,400,000, 5,000,000, and
5,700,000, respectively.

In 1996, the projected distribution of the total barcode scannner
revenues by product type is: handheld laser scanners-31.1%; fixed
position laser scanners-49.4%; handheld CCD (charge coupled device)

scanners-12.9%; and wand/lightpen scanners-6.6%. The distribution
in 2000 will be: handheld laser scanners-31.8%; fixed position laser

scanners-46.7%; handheld CCD scanners-16.0%; and wand/lightpen
scanners-5.5%.

In addition, as of last September, LXE had shipped more than 200 2.4
GHz RF (radio frequency) terminals to ANC (Brussels, Belgium), one of
the leading five express package delivery services in England. A
major contract involving a 70-site installation was secured by LIS
(London, England), an LXE international distributor organization (IDO)
and one of the largest logistics systems integrators in Europe.

ANC selected LXE's advanced frequency hopping spread spectrum
system, which provides the backbone for wireless client/server
computing with the former's existing system. The LXE 2320 Scout
(TM) handheld computers (which have a base price of $1,900) are
used to scan barcode tracking labels on individual packages as they
are handled at various points in the delivery process. Such a tracking
system permits ANC to maintain "visibility" for each package from
the time of pickup to the point of delivery.

The 2320 DOS-based handheld data collection computer allows for
both warehouse and field automation operations in a single unit; and
features modular options which permit configuration for a wide
variety of auto ID inputs, including barcode scanning, "touch"
memory modules, RS-232 port, and/or infrared out for wireless
printing. The device supports RF transaction processing and batch
data collection. Working in combination with LXE's 6410 OmniNet
Access Point, the 2300 Scout is able to connect directly to LAN
servers over the wireless link running DOS applications.

"One of the obvious benefits of the new scanning and dispatch
system is that customer inquiries can be provided quickly and
efficiently, also potential problems are virtually eliminated," noted
Andrew Callaghan, ANC's managing director. "As service levels
become even more stringent, only the best will survive. ANC is
determined to be the leading service provider in this region,
therefore, we chose our suppliers very carefully. We feel that LXE's
2.4 GHz RF system will give us the cutting edge over our
competition."

Global revenues for barcode data terminals are predicted to increase
at a 13.6% compound annual rate to exceed $1.4 billion in 2000, from
$584.3  million in 1993, according to Frost & Sullivan's World
Barcode Equipment Markets  report. Revenues for 1996-1999 are
projected at $845.9 million,  $966.6 million, about $1.1 billion, and
over $1.2 billion, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of barcode data terminals are anticipated
to expand at nearly a 19.2% compound annual rate to total 1,730,900
in 2000, compared to 507,500 in 1993. Unit shipments for 1996-
1999 are placed at 927,300, about 1,142,600, 1,346,900, and
1,522,000, respectively.

In 1996, the projected product distribution of the total barcode data
terminals is: batch terminals-59.6%; and RF terminals-40.4%. The
distribution in 2000 will be: batch terminals-53.6%; and RF
terminals-46.4%.

The value of US automatic ID system and software sales, including
exports, is forecast to expand at a 10.9% average annual rate to
approach $8.1 billion in 2000, compared to about $4.3 billion in
1994, according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'s
Automatic Identification Systems  (K4G-12R). The data includes
barcode systems, magnetic stripe and smart cards, biometrics,
machine vision, radio frequency, optical character recognition, and
voice recognition auto ID technologies. Domestic sales of barcode
systems are projected to grow at a 12% average annual rate to
exceed $6 billion in 2000, from over $3 billion in 1994.

In 1994, US sales of RF ID systems totaled $391 million, $156 million
of which was accounted for by the manufacturing industry.

RED PEPPER EXPLOITS A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY

The ResponseAgent (TM) product family from Red Pepper Software
Company (San Mateo, CA, 415-578-2640), an innovative developer of
real-time supply chain optimization software based on intelligent
agent technology, will be available with full support for Microsoft
Windows (R) 95 Clients, and Windows NT Servers in March of this
year. Production pricing for ResponseAgent, which is also available
with UNIX support, begins at $150,000.

Red Pepper's support for Windows 95 and NT integrates the leading
desktop user interface and environment with a highly advanced
supply chain optimization system that provides manufacturers with
an "intelligent assistant" which generates optimized plans, constantly
monitors vital manufacturing variables, and proposes solutions to
large-scale problems. Since most users are familiar with Windows,
the ResponseAgent learning curve will be quite rapid.

Users can, moreover, simply "drag" information from the
ResponseAgent and "drop" it into any desktop application--including
Microsoft Office--for further analysis or presentation. Individuals can

participate in planning sessions from remote sites, since the
ResponseAgent Windows 95 Client is designed to operate over
ordinary phone lines. The Windows 95 Client and Windows NT
Server support offered by the ResponseAgent products leads to a
significant increase in user productivity, decreases the overall cost of

client/server platforms, and accelerates ResponseAgent's return-on-
investment.

"We believe this a very important technology development for Red
Pepper," stated Jim Shepherd, vice president at Advanced
Manufacturing Research, Inc. (Boston, MA, 617-542-6600). "They
have correctly identified that manufacturers need the ability to
support mixed networks of UNIX and NT, and that Windows 95 will
rapidly emerge as the user interface standard. The improved user
interface and seamless integration with desktop applications like
Microsoft Office should significantly enhance the productivity of
individual ResponseAgent users and their ability to engage in
collaborative planning."

"Our ResponseAgents running Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows
NT offers a very wide range of benefits with unprecedented levels of
power and flexibility," noted Monte Zweben, Red Pepper's president.
"The combination provides five key benefits that ad up to superior
performance for our supply chain optimization customers. These
include the ability to plan and schedule remotely via modem-based
portable computers, seamless integration with Microsoft Office and
Backoffice applications and services, individually customized
ResponseAgent user interfaces, and a choice of either or both UNIX
and NT servers."

"Red Pepper is the leading developer of intelligent agent-based
supply chain optimization software, and Microsoft is very pleased to
have their family of products running on Windows 95 and Windows
NT," commented Doug Henrich, director, Microsoft Developer
Relations Group. "Red Pepper's ResponseAgents are addressing
enterprise-wide supply chain management challenges for
manufacturers, and Microsoft's strategy is to provide the best
scalable operating systems from the desktop to the data center. With
our Microsoft Office and Backoffice product families, we are also
providing the enterprise-wide applications and services
infrastructure todays leading manufacturers require. Microsoft's and
Red Pepper's products and strategies compliment one another to
provide quality solutions for manufacturing customers."

"From an end-user perspective, it will be incredibly powerful to
leverage all of our standard desktop productivity tools," noted Chris
Bourne, production planning manager at 3Com Corporation. "We have
a huge investment in personal computer hardware and software, and
we want to take advantage of the seamless integration of our

ResponseAgent-based Worldwide Inventory Planning System (WIPS)
with the rest of 3Com's mission-critical applications. The modem-
based remote access capabilities of the new ResponseAgent also
provide another powerful capability for our users. With the
ResponseAgent Windows 95 Client, 3Com will further advance its
leadership and competitive advantage in manufacturing."

Windows 95 provides the user interface for millions of personal
computers operating worldwide. The ResponseAgent Windows 95
Client enables users to enjoy the ease-of-use of PC-based applications
with an extremely advanced type of supply chain optimization
software. The advanced capabilities of Windows 95--such as point
and click, drag and drop, property inspectors, context-sensitive
menus, and on-line help--apply to the new ResponseAgent Client.
Ongoing user productivity is further bolstered through the user
interface consistency and powerful functions of Windows 95.

The overall system cost reduction enabled by Windows 95 extends
from platform acquisition through the life of the ResponseAgent
solutions. The initial system cost is reduced by employing standard
PC hardware for the ResponseAgent; and the flexibility to select the
best servers for particular applications further diminishes costs. The
ability to achieve more rapid system implementations results in
faster payback and higher ROI for ResponseAgents.

Since the ResponseAgent Client can fully interact with the Server
over ordinary phone lines, remote desktop and portable systems can
fully participate in the planning process--whether at home or on the
road. The same access can be provided to key suppliers, field sales
personnel, or potentially customers requiring the latest information
about product availability. The ResponseAgent Client further
maximizes the power of Windows 95 by seamlessly integrating with
standard desktop applications, including Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint,
Access, or Mail. Users can customize the ResponseAgent user
interface to meet their specific requirements. For example, the order
or format of ResponseAgent spreadsheets, or particular graphical
views, can readily be modified without programming based on user
preferences.

Founded in 1993, Red Pepper has leveraged its supply chain
optimization technology developed at NASA and coupled it with a
new object-oriented system, architected to help manufacturers plan
and schedule their operations in an increasingly complex business
environment. The company's products have evolved from the Ground
Processing Scheduling System used to refurbish the Space Shuttle
following space missions into ResponseAgent software products that
complement existing transactional systems (MRPII, DRP, shop-floor
control) and enable real-time responsiveness to customer demands.

Red Pepper's product offerings include Enterprise ResponseAgent

(enterprise-wide planning and scheduling systems), Production
ResponseAgent (integrated planning and scheduling systems for
production facilities), and Distribution ResponseAgent (integrated
planning and scheduling for distribution centers). ResponseAgents
are especially suited for manufacturers encountering significant

unpredictability in customer demand, material availability, or
capacity optimization. Manufacturing processes benefiting from such
products include make-to-stock, assemble-to-order, make-to-order,
and engineer-to-order.

The value of global shipments of US-based vendors' microcomputer-
based manufacturing planning and control software (excluding
services and hardware) is forecast to expand at about an 8.2% annual
rate to approach $1.6 billion in 1999, from nearly $1.1 billion in
1994, according to Plant-Wide Research Group's (North Billerica, MA,

508-663-9212) annual Manufacturing Planning & Control Systems
Review and Forecast. The value of shipments in 1996 is put at nearly
$1.2 billion.

BAAN AND HP ENHANCE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP

Baan Company (Ede, The Netherlands/Menlo Park, CA, 415-462-
4949) and Hewlett-Packard Company (Palo Alto, CA, 415-857-1501)
are expanding their seven-year technology and service relationship
on a global scale. The enhancement of the relationship furthers
Baan's longstanding commitment to provide joint HP customers with
a strong multi-site, multi-national manufacturing solution, and
signifies HP's recognition of Baan as a leading global Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) software provider.

"Baan prides itself on sharing HP's value of being customer-centric,"
noted M.R. Rangaswami, Baan's vice president of worldwide
marketing. With this new alliance status, we are positioned to deliver
a higher degree of customer satisfaction through tighter technology
links and streamlined pre- and post-sales requirements
management. Additionally, this relationship provides the synergy
necessary to deliver a whole product--including software
applications--to the manufacturing marketplace, as well as key
vertical markets."

As manufacturers migrate to a global environment, information
increasingly must be managed at a multi-site, multi-national level,
and accommodate such variables as local languages, currencies,
manufacturing practices, and financial requirements. Baan--through
its TRITON family of client/server applications--and HP have jointly
supported hundreds of customers worldwide over the past seven
years. The companies jointly enable customers to progress from
proprietary, host-based systems to a distributed, open systems
architecture suitable for global business.

About 50% of Baan's customers--including ABB, Boeing, Hitachi, Oki

Manufacturing, Philips Medical Systems, Northern Telecom, and
Snap-On Incorporated--rely jointly on Baan and HP for a flexible
solution accommodating their changing business requirements. Under
the enhanced global partnering arrangement, the two companies will
be aligned more closely in terms of technology and
marketing/customer satisfaction.

Baan currently uses the HP 9000 for its own development
environment. The enhanced global partnering relationship will
enable the two companies to provide dedicated development teams
to optimize the performance of Baan's ERP applications on the HP
3000 platform. Such development teams will also build tight
integration between Baan's TRITON applications and HP's Service
Guard software to ensure high availability of TRITON/HP 9000 for

mission-critical environments. Moreover, the companies will jointly
integrate with respect to Baan applications and HP OpenView a
complete environment for application, system, and network
management, which are vital for multi-site operations.

Baan and HP are committed to jointly delivering the most advanced
pre- and post-sales services to boost overall customer satisfaction.
"HP is pleased to have Baan Company as one of HP's global partners,"
sated Janice Chaffin, director of channels marketing at HP's General
Systems Division. "Customers can avail themselves of the world-class
consulting and support organizations of both companies, knowing
they will get a complete solution."

The two companies will develop cooperative sales and marketing
programs for strategic accounts, as well as for key vertical markets
(including automotive and electronics). In addition, customers will be
able to leverage HP's Professional Sales Organization that offers

consulting/services for information technology architecture,
benchmarking, systems and network management, and customization
of HP software solutions. Such capabilities complement Baan's
present methodologies/services that insure swift, successful
implementations of TRITON applications.

Emblematic of their commitment, HP and Baan have jointly
established two Cooperative Technology Centers (CTCs) located in
Barneveld, The Netherlands and in Silicon Valley in the US. The
centers will focus on offering pre- and post-sales support in
simulating the customer' implementation environment, and joint
development projects.

Global primary software/services revenues from ERP vendors totaled
$3.0-$3.1 billion in 1994, and are forecast to increase about 15-25%
annually for at least the next three years, according to the Gartner
Group (Stamford, CT, 203-964-0096). Revenues for 1995 are put at
$3.5-$3.7 billion.

COMING SOON TO YOUR FACTORY: WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS


The boom in wireless communications technology is soon going to hit the factory
floor, say analysts and those involved with the new systems. With the
unprecedented growth in consumer markets for cellular phones and such products
as wireless speaker systems, the technology for wireless data communications is
quickly maturing and coming down in price.

For companies supplying wireless equipment, the manufacturing market "is going
to be a very big deal," says Jack Killion of Wireless Publishing Inc.Others
are just as bullish.  "There is going to be a massive boom, driven by the
cellular phone market pushing down the costs of components and chips," says
Wayne Manges of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Centers for Manufacturing
Technology.  "This is a key technology for the 21st Century.  People who get
in early and stay with it will do extremely well."

Numerous companies are installing wireless networks in their factories.  "Our
customer list has become endless," says John Davis, Director of Industrial
Technology Marketing for Akron, Ohio-based Telxon, a publicly held company
(NASDAQ symbol TLXN).  Telxon expects to grow its wireless manufacturing group
by almost 30 percent this year.

"Our growth is out of sight," says Davis. "It's very profitable." With the
amount of growth that exists in the market "we're hiring people like crazy,"
Davis adds. "If you have a skill and you know this industry, we will hire you."
(Telxon supplies entire systems including handheld, pen-based, voice and vision
computers and real time data collection devices. Its revenues increased 28
percent from 1994 to 1995, from $271 million to $379 million.)

Ford Motor's Louisville, Ky., plant, a four-million square foot facility, has
installed a wireless data communications system. Boeing, Chrysler, GM, General
Electric, Miller Brewing, Northrop, Allied Signal, Intel, consumer packaged
goods companies, retail stores like Wal-Mart and others such as Disney and
American Express are installing systems for use in material management,
warehousing, quality control, monitoring and maintenance of machine tools and
in-building paging.

"The leading edge companies in every industry are the ones who are doing this,"
says Killion. "They're biting the bullet of higher costs because they recognize
the benefits are so good that they're just jumping on it."

Wireless manufacturing plants offer the opportunity for companies to retrofit
facilities without extensive engineering hassles. "You can never get the cable
right" in a manufacturing environment," says Manges of Oak Ridge. "There are
people who spend their whole life keeping the cable in order." Wiring in a
nuclear power plant, for instance, typically costs about $2,000 per foot. 

Wireless systems also allow companies to put real-time information in the hands
of empowered workers and they help in decision making. There are also benefits
associated with the speed and reliability of data and the ability to spot
problems earlier with fewer people. Farther down the line, wireless can help
improve customer service and lower inventories.

Analysts project the market for wireless automated data collection at $3.4
billion this year with a growth rate exceeding 20 percent per year.

But there are still a lot of technical issues that need to be resolved before
wireless systems become ubiquitous in manufacturing operations. Integrating
hundreds or thousands of data-generating sources into one seamless system is a
big challenge. Redundancy has to be built in the system.

"Because of the size of the problems and the amount of data [that is being
generated], wireless requires multidisciplinary people," says Manges.
"Theoreticians, mathematicians, communications experts, computer junkies" are
all needed to integrate sensors and data sources, all of which have their own
channel. "If all you've done is replace wire you haven't solved the problem,"
says Manges. "It's the non-architectural issues that are important: data
structuring, queuing theory, modeling. You have to start small and establish
standards as you build these systems." 

"Wireless is only now starting to be applied" in commercial enterprises, says
Killion. "It's a high priority for suppliers because there is so much
low-hanging fruit" in virtually every industrial sector.

Davis of Telxon can be reached at 216-873-2963; Killion can be reached at
201-285-1500; Manges can be reached at 423-574-8529.

LARGE MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS JOIN ENERGY DEPARTMENT'S AGILE MANUFACTURING
PROGRAM


The Department of Energy's Technologies Enabling Agile Manufacturing (TEAM)
program, about a year old, is "beginning to put some flesh on the bones," says
program manager Diane Bird.

TEAM is beginning to do "practical and important things," says Aris
Melissaratos Vice President of Science, Technology and Quality at Westinghouse
Electric Corp.  "They've taken the concepts of agility and are bringing
technology to the shop floor...This is substantive work and brings agility to
the real world rather than it being theory and academics."

TEAM's team now includes about 35 companies, many of which are household
names, such as Cummins Engine, General Motors, AlliedSignal and numerous
others from a variety of industries.  Universities, R&D consortia and other
government agencies are engaged in the effort.

"We're not industry specific, nor are we terribly process specific," says Bird,
who works in DOE's Defense Program's Office of Economic Competitiveness. "We're
going to take the highest priority needs across a variety of industry sectors
and across a variety of processes that are in concert with our own [DOE] needs
and work with that group."

DOE has committed $5 million a year for three years to the TEAM effort.  Bird
estimates that another $5 million in federal funding is finding its way into
the program through other government programs.  Industry is devoting about $10
million a year in the effort, for a yearly total of about $20 million.
"Financially, things are getting tougher," says Bird.  "People are beginning
to see the benefit of dividing up the workload and sharing the results."

One of the primary themes of TEAM is the integration of various design
software tools with the equipment that makes parts and products.  Customers,
suppliers and vendors in virtually every manufacturing sector have different
CAD tools, NC tools and NC programming software.  "One of the big complaints
is that not much of this talks to each other," Bird explains.  "It's not a
simple task to make that happen and to make it happen without data loss or
glitches."

The Energy Department has been dealing with this problem for 15 years. Its
nuclear weapons production complex has purchased machine tool controllers and
has modified them for its own use. That labor intensive effort worked fine when
DOE had lots of money, but its budget is going down and the agency is becoming
more dependent on the private sector to pick up the slack. Moreover, many
commercial companies have the same problem of integrating different design and
manufacturing systems.

"In the past we've had to maintain our hardware and software ourself," says
Bird. "But that's expensive and inefficient and we'd like to go buy this stuff
off the shelf." By involving industry in helping suppliers produce open
architecture equipment and software, the entire supply base will be far more
robust. "A larger group of users in the commercial environment will help find
glitches, improve it, and drive additional revisions and upgrades much more
quickly than we could with our low production volume," says Bird.

There is no doubt that this would happen without the Energy Department's help.
But DOE is restricted to "Buy American" procurement provisions. Unfortunately,
many overseas suppliers have no desire to sell equipment that would be used to
manufacture nuclear bombs.

Overseas suppliers also tend to implement their latest generation systems on
their home turf. "It's much more difficult to have those relationships with
foreign countries and assure that you are indeed getting the newest
state-of-the-art equipment," says Bird.

The new tools would be developed without DOE assistance, but if U.S. industry
misses the market window, then U.S. companies may not be involved both in
supplying the manufacturing systems and utilizing them. And thus DOE's push.
"Sure it will happen anyway," says Bird. "But will it happen by developments by
U.S. companies and entities or will it happen overseas and then we will just be
purchasing all of this?"

Bird can be reached at 202-586-0499. For written information on TEAM (the
compilation of overhead slides from the Annual TEAM Meeting), contact Richard
Neal of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Centers for Manufacturing

AT 101 YEARS OLD, NAME WILL KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT


The National Association of Manufacturers has just completed its 100th year of
operation and the campaign it started planning four years ago to boost the
image of manufacturing in the U.S.  society will continue.

"The whole idea of the Manufacturing Campaign is that it would reach a peak in
1995, and that's true," says Ladd Biro, Vice President of Marketing and Member
Services at NAM and President of the organization's Manufacturing Institute.
But there is plenty of more work to do.

No other national group is tasked with promoting the importance of
manufacturing to the country.  When NAM president Jerry Jasinowski started
planning the campaign, few positive statements were being made about
manufacturing.  Layoffs, pollution and knuckle-headed management stories ruled
the day.  Manufacturers were on the defense.

But there are plenty of success stories that have since been written and the
Manufacturing Institute is doing its best to target members of Congress and the
media to pick up on them.

The campaign last year involved hundreds of people at the national, state and
local level. NAM sponsored 40 events in 25 states. It commissioned artwork and
posters by Peter Max. It wrote a manufacturing coffee table book. It promoted
manufacturing through a national media campaign. And it created a popular
manufacturing educational program for the nation's high schools that is now
being incorporated in a CD-ROM format.

The entire campaign consumed some $3 million and was funded by the nation's
largest manufacturing companies.  Intel, for instance, is underwriting an
$80,000 essay contest for high-school students.  The theme is the future of
manufacturing in America and the contest has drawn more than 2,300 entries.
Only about 750 were expected.

NAM expects the manufacturing campaign to consume between $1 million and $1.5
million this year. "I don't see us letting up on a publicity campaign," says
Biro, who joined NAM from American Airlines in 1992. "There is always going to
be a job to do." Much of the funding this year will come from grants.

The campaign has done a great deal to improve NAM's image as well. NAM is
extremely healthy, says Biro. Revenues have increased by 6 to 7 percent a year
for the past four years. "We're not trying to grow staff, but last year was a
record for membership growth," says the 34-year-old Biro. NAM now has 13,600
member companies.

A lot of that growth has to do with the improved fortunes of manufacturers and
the high profile of NAM president Jerry Jasinowski. But a great deal of it can
be attributed to  Biro and his staff's attention to improving services to
members and marketing NAM in a more aggressive manner. Others in the trade
association field are envious of the job NAM has done in this regard, and it is
often held up as a benchmark for how to improve member services and increase
membership.

Central to the marketing operation is a telemarketing sales force of 20, which
will be increased by three this year. Paid on a commission basis, these folks
call prospective members and those who are renewing their memberships. Biro
believes he can add 1,000 new members this year and he has a personal goal of
25,000 members. The average member pays around $500 a year in dues, but the
range is from $150 to $130,000 per year.

"Our image has changed," he says. NAM is no longer thought of as being a stodgy
place. The organization has improved its communications to members and has
started promoting its own accomplishments rather than taking a more modest
approach to its successes in Washington. Biro can be reached through NAM at

ARTHUR ANDERSEN'S VIEW INTO THE 1996 CRYSTAL BALL


One of the keys to success for manufacturers in 1996 will be "innovative
alliances," says Steven Hronec, worldwide director of Arthur Andersen's
manufacturing industry practice. While new approaches to improving operations
and reducing costs will be important, "manufacturers that want staying power
will continue to use...new alliances to compete," says Hronec.

Companies will need to team up with customers, suppliers and competitors and
the most successful firms will access customer and supplier information
through electronic data interchange and the Internet.  The most successful
global companies will move beyond the "country-to-country" management approach
and will use communications technologies to choose from global vendors and
suppliers, rather than being limited to local, regional or national resources.

Manufacturing Execution Systems and Enterprise Requirements Planning will
continue to gain in popularity during the year.  Companies that involve
employees in their strategic planning processes will succeed above and beyond
their rivals, says Hronec.

Savvy manufacturers will use "activity-based cost management" which will allow
them to restructure their operations to concentrate their resources on the
processes that are the most profitable and cost effective.  "We see
manufacturers either combining operations or splitting them up to enhance
their competitive advantage," says Hronec.  "Either way the result is
something different from what they were before."

Finally, the ISO9000 quality and ISO14000 environmental standards will continue
to be important. ISO14000 will "soon become a basic and necessary part of doing
business around the world," says Hronec, who can be reached at 213-614-8512.

LIMBERING UP IS A BEST PRACTICE AT SPRING FACTORY RUN BY DAYTON PARTS INC.


To manufacture springs, you have to be flexible. That's the lesson learned by
Dayton Parts Inc., of Harrisburg, Pa., a $57 million manufacturer of 17,000
different types of springs primarily used in trucks.

The company had a problem of excessive worker injuries which it discovered
occurred almost entirely during the first two hours of each shift.  In 1990,
the company experimented with a stretching program for all of its plant
personnel and a core group continued with the program for one year.  "At the
end of the year, none of the employees in the stretching group had been
injured," says a U.S.  Navy Best Manufacturing Practices survey of the company
conducted this past summer.  "This result influenced DPI to make stretching
exercises mandatory again in 1992.  All employees are now required to stretch
for 10 to 15 minutes before starting production.  This time is included within
the normal workshift."

The stretching program costs about $75,000 per year to operate, but it pays a
handsome dividend. In conjunction with other safety programs, the company's
annual cost of workman's compensation has decreased from $700,000 to $200,000.
The savings were refunded to the company and the money was used in part to pay
employee bonuses.

Dayton Parts sounds like most companies that have become enlightened over the
past decade.  Its management philosophy is based Eliah Goldratt's theory of
constraints as outlined in his book, The Goal, which is required reading in
all plant departments.  "Every action is focused on the common goal of making
money now and in the future," says the BMP survey.  "This program...has
effected a real cultural change throughout the company."

Safety, customer service, quality and cost reduction are driving forces in the
company. "Shop-floor supervisors now function more as coaches in the continuous
improvement process as the workcells are becoming sell-managed," says the BMP
survey. "Employees are actively involved in continuous improvement teams and
their input is making a difference."

For a copy of the 12-page report, contact Ernie Renner, Director of the BMP
program at 1-800-789-4267, or fax a request to him at 301-403-8180 (e-mail:

A NEW BUSINESS MODEL FOR DOD BEGINS TO GAITHER MOMENTUM: ADVANCED CONCEPT
TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS


The Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration  (ACTD) program at the Pentagon
has evolved in just two years into becoming a substantial effort that will
leverage three-quarters of a billion dollars. And if the Pentagon brass has its
way, it should grow substantially in the future. 

For fiscal year 1997, the ACTD office working with the services had drawn up a
list of 100 potential ACTDs-"fieldable prototypes"-before winnowing that down
to 46.  The office expects to start another dozen or so new projects next
year, although the number of new starts "is not the characteristic by which we
ought to be measured," says Jack Bachkosky, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
for Advanced Technology.  The program also has been pared back by Congress.
The Pentagon asked for $65 million this year, but received an appropriation of
$39 million.

The program aims to quickly prove the viability of new military systems within
tight budgetary constraints.  The systems are tailored to the needs of the end
user-the warfighters-and include close participation by technologists,
industry and program managers.  "We're marriage brokers," says Bachkosky in
explaining his role in fostering the deployment of commercial off-the-shelf
and mature technologies into useful new defense systems.

The eight ACTDs now under way and the nine new projects that will start in
1996 represent a new way of doing business for the Pentagon.  With technology
changing faster than the defense procurement system, military planners are
fielding systems that are obsolete before they go into production.

The ACTDs only embrace mature technologies that can be fielded almost
immediately in new systems, "We make sure the users understand they know what
the technology will and will not do," Bachkosky told a group of reporters in a
recent Pentagon briefing.  Some technologies may not be mature enough to carry
out a far-fledged mission.  Others that use commercial components not designed
for the military may not work without radical reengineering at substantial
cost.  Such technologies are probably not good candidates for ACTDs, says
Bachkosky.

"ACTD provides the procedures for the users to identify his needs initially,
then there is a continuous interaction" so the user understands how much such a
system will cost and whether it's feasible for it to go into production through
the normal acquisition process, he explains. 

Understanding the cost of production and ownership-maintenance and manpower
needed to operate the system-is part of the ACTD process. "If it does provide a
needed capability and its costs are not insurmountable, then it will go into
low-rate production," says Bachkosky.

The "Predator" autonomous aerial vehicle, which is now flying above Bosnia, is
an example of a more mature ACTD.  It has a range of 500 miles; can fly at
25,000 feet for 40 hours and can cruise at 70 miles per hour.  It is equipped
with a payload of sensors.  Commanders on the ground would love to have a
system that flies at mach one or mach 1.6.  But to field such a system, the
ACTD program would have to begin an entirely new project.  If the field
commanders "want to buy a 911 Porsche for a Honda Civic price" then the ACTD
office has to tell them "we can't afford it," says Bachkosky.  "We give them
an estimate on how much more it will cost.  The warfighter can accept that or
not."

The ACTD program "is a way of working around the acquisition process,"
Bachkosky adds.  "It provides an entry for systems the military wants and
needs."  The office is working closely with industry and industry associations
to create projects based on purely commercial technologies.  Even a company
like Disney has something to offer in the way of simulation technology.
"They're not immune from taking money from DOD as they are from anywhere
else," says Bachkosky, who can be reached at 703-697-6446.

APPROVED 1996 ACTDS:
o Combat ID
o Logistics (Total Asset Visibility)
o Medium Lift Helicopter (completed)
o Semi-Automated Imagery Processing

JAPANESE AUTO EXECUTIVE TELLS DETROIT TO QUIT WHINING


The Japanese automobile market is not a "sanctuary" as Chrysler Chairman Robert
Eaton says it is, according to William Duncan, general director of the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association. "Eleven auto manufacturers now compete in
Japan intensely for a market that is less than half the size of the U.S.," he
says. "This is hardly a sanctuary."

The Big Three's problems in Japan are being caused "precisely" for the reason
that Japan's market "is not a sanctuary that allows manufacturers to ignore
customers needs for easy profits."  In August of last year, imports took 13
percent of Japan's automobile market and 32 percent of the large car segment
was captured by Ford, GM and Chrysler.

"Detroit's automakers have only recently indicated a serious interest in
selling cars in Japan and still have a long way to go to match their European
counterparts in product availability, market fit and investment," says Duncan,
who can be reached at 202-296-8537.

CORPORATE NEWS: KOLLMORGAN CORP.; SELECTRON CORP


Kollmorgan Corp.  has won the The National Electrical Manufacturers
Association's Automation Forum's Renewal Award for improving its manufacturing
facilities and keeping them in the United States.  "Kollmorgan could have
easily decided to manufacture products offshore, but believed they could
achieve competitive manufacturing costs and efficiencies by rearranging its
facilities into focused factories in North America," says Automation Forum
executive director Bill Rolland, who can be reached at 703-841-3200.

Solectron Corp., the company that does nothing other than focus on
manufacturing electronics products for others, had another banner quarter.
Its sales for the first quarter of 1996 were up 36 percent to $691 million,
and its net income soared 50 percent to $27.3 million ($0.52 per share).
"During the quarter, several of our customers, particularly those in the
peripherals, telecommunications and workstation markets, expanded their
relationship with us and/or increased their volume requirements," says
Solectron president and CEO Koichi Nishimura, who can be reached at

THE NAVY'S INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO MAINTAIN CAPABILITY WHILE REDUCING ITS
INFRASTRUCTURE


Like the other military services, the Navy has an extensive number of
manufacturing facilities.  For the most part, these are referred to as depots,
although there are other manufacturing assets, such as shipyards and
industrial departments.  Over the years, these facilities have been used to
maintain the fleet and have benefited from protective legislation guaranteeing
sources of work.  But as the Defense Department continues to downsize, these
in-house assets are being viewed for reduction or closure.

The current policy of the government is to depend on the private sector to the
maximum extent possible.  This policy has been established in OMB Circular
A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities," and has recently been
reemphasized in the "Roles and Mission" report presented to the Secretary of
Defense.  Under certain conditions, however, the private sector is not used.
These would include areas protected by the government to maintain capability
as governed by the "60/40" rule which keeps 60 percent of all maintenance work
in-house, and areas where the private sector has defaulted on performance
requirements, can't respond to fleet emergencies, or chooses not to bid on
government solicitations.

There are presently two versions of legislation pending in Congress to address
the "60/40" rule.  Both bills appear to eliminate this "60/40" restriction,
forcing the services to outsource work previously performed in-house.  Taking
the potential legislative decision to the extreme, depots would be closed for
business and private industry would become responsible for all defense
industrial work.  This would include those categories of work that private
industry failed to do correctly the first time.

Obviously, out-sourcing all defense work is not the sole solution to
downsizing.  The government will need to maintain some in-house manufacturing
capability to respond to fleet needs when private industry cannot do so.  The
result will be a compromise to the "60/40" rule, where the government
maintains a much smaller in-house capability.  A challenge for the Defense
Department, therefore, is deciding how to address this impending legislation
in a timely and efficient manner.

In Lakehurst, N.J., the Navy has a $200 million manufacturing facility, which
occupies 250,000 square feet of unique buildings and is staffed by 214
manufacturing engineers and artisans.  The primary purpose of the Lakehurst
plant is to provide prototype manufacturing support, producibility analysis,
drawing package validation and the application of new manufacturing
technologies to the design, development, and product verification of flight
critical aircraft launch and recovery and support equipment.  A significant
part of the Lakehurst work involves completing contractor defaulted efforts,
responding to fleet-critical needs and conducting work the private sector was
not interested in doing.

Supported by the National Performance Review recommendations, a downsizing and
the creation of a competency-aligned organization, Lakehurst has been reduced
to its core, with employment down approximately 33 percent from four years
ago.  The key to the continued success of this downsized organization was
identifying the critical in-house labor required to perform the tasks
necessary to deliver quality equipment and support contracting efforts.  Tasks
that could be performed by industry were earmarked for contracting out.  The
net result is an industrial facility that is working with non-defense
organizations and is operating at the same level of performance at a reduced
cost.

According to Richard Rumpf, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Research,
Engineering and Systems, partnering permits the government to maximize use of
private industry, reduce the possibility of default, keep the fleet running
smoothly and allow the government to reduce its size while maintaining
capability. 

     The partnering concept is also fully compliant with Federal Acquisition
Regulations and public law. Concepts for partnering are being refined and
explored at Navy Lakehurst and, if successful, offer the possibility for
applying the partnership concept to depots when and if the "60/40" rule is
abolished in the December, 1997, timeframe. Partnerships are a win-win
arrangement for both the Navy and industry.

1995: THE YEAR IN QUOTES


"If it ain't broken, break it," became a cliche in 1995, but it's probably the
best way to describe what was happening in the industrial sector last year.

If only that was the case in politics. Politicians spent the year breaking what
was already broken. As U.S. industry stormed into 1996, the U.S. government
limped. 

While the private sector was undergoing a rebirth with a surge of confidence
provided by the maturation of new technologies and the booming stock market,
the U.S.  government reached a nadir, getting bombed in Oklahoma and closing
its doors in Washington.  If it's any consolation to those who work for Uncle
Sam, it wasn't long ago that U.S.  industry was in about the same situation
with few predicting the turnaround that has ensued.

1995 will be remembered as the year the Internet sprang into the consciousness
of the nation. It was a year in which the electronic revolution intensified.
Manufacturing found a seat at the corporate table, having been orphaned for
decades. The quality revolution seeped further into the business culture. And
the government was on the verge of a radical restructuring.

For the vast majority of people in the U.S.  who are involved in the new
industries that have been created over the past 20 years and the older
industries that have been transformed by the new technologies, a new age of
hope has definitely appeared, driven by the knowledge that humans are
resourceful, extremely hard working, are capable of changing quickly and
learning new skills.  This abundance of energy is collectively transforming
the way we live.  All of this is good news.

Here are some of the more profound, enlightened and interesting things people
said in 1995, as captured by the editorial staff of Manufacturing News.

ON INDUSTRY

"There is a disproportionate amount of pessimism in America about our ability
to compete globally.  Remember, 10 years ago people were saying that we
couldn't compete at all and we were living in a post-industrial society and
manufacturing was written off.  The big story is that that is not happening.
I don't think the majority of Americans know about this story."
--Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, May
15, 1995

Over the next 50 years, companies will generate hundreds of billions of
dollars-and maybe even trillions of dollars-a year in revenue. Management will
utilize concepts common in organisms and start applying them to corporate
structures. "We will take anecdotes out of nature and convert them into
practical, living guidelines. We will find better ways of letting things
organize from the bottom instead of from the top."
--Bob Galvin, Chairman of the Executive Committee, Motorola, Nov. 15, 1995

"I don't want guys on the [manufacturing] line supporting me.  I want to
support the guys who are doing the work.  I'm just overhead."
--Koichi Nishimura, President and CEO of Solectron Corp., Jan. 3, 1995

"Will Rogers once said, 'Even if you are on the right track, you'll get run
over if you just sit there.' And he was right.  None of us can afford to
become complacent."
--William Mitchell, Vice Chairman, Texas Instruments, March  31, 1995.

"Leadership is all about causing change. Management is about maintaining a
certain level of performance or implementing a program. You have to have both
skills, but the one that we have least of at this point is leadership."
--Eric Houts, Continuous Improvement Program Manager, Kaiser Electronics, Feb.
1, 1995

The Asian competitive threat, particularly from South Korea, "is coming much
faster than most people think and the implications for business, government,
our customers and employees-our overall competitiveness and our standard of
living-are enormous."  The U.S.  government and industry must undergo a "major
change, [otherwise] the role of the Western World will gradually diminish."
--Alex Trotman, Chairman and CEO, Ford Motor Co., Sept. 15, 1995

"I will be a very content business executive when we sell our $250 million
[defense] business and I don't have to deal with the Defense Department of the
United States or [defense departments] anywhere else in the world. I will be
very content when we're down to zero percent of our business."
--Tracy O'Rourke, Chairman and CEO, Varian   Associates Inc., March 15, 1995.
Five months later Varian sold its Electron Devices operation to Leonard Green &
Partners for $200 million.

"I often do a pronoun test when I go into companies.  I say to the workers,
'Tell me about this company?' And if they say 'They' [when talking about
management], I know it is [a struggling] company.  If they say 'We,' I know
it's a different kind of company."
--Labor Secretary Robert Reich, April 17, 1995.

"I have been through the entire transition of the military being the primary
driver of new semiconductor technologies to the military being such a small
part of it that it doesn't drive anything, virtually,"
--Don Walker, Vice President of Motorola and Director of the company's
Commercial-Plus Technologies Operation formerly the Military Products
Operation, based in Tempe, Ariz, speaking about the company's decision to
close its military semiconductor business, May 15, 1995

"In our world-class plants the only person not on a shift is a plant manager
and he is required to come down once a month and run the line."
--James Schoonover, Director of Operations for DuPont, July 3, 1995

"This year, the government of Switzerland is procuring more fighter aircraft
than the United States. We are primarily working off our backlog and new orders
are at an all-time low."
--James Sinnett, Vice President of New Aircraft and Missile Products, McDonnell
Douglas, September 1, 1995

"Most of our major new products have come from the unarticulated needs of our
customers and understanding that. We have to raise the level of innovation we
have in the company."
--William Coyne, Vice President, R&D, 3M, Oct. 17, 1995

"The nice thing about the [semiconductor fabrication plants being built] is
that today, 60 percent of the equipment going into them-whether they're in the
United States or somewhere else-is from U.S.  suppliers."
--William Spencer, President of Sematech, April 17, 1995

"An awareness of the electronics [contract] manufacturing services industry
continues to increase among analysts and investors. In our opinion, this is an
opportune time for investors to capitalize on this industry."
--William Cage, J.C. Bradford & Co., September 1, 1995

"Quantitative analysis of the culture of top growth companies reveals that they
consistently place higher value in areas such as teamwork, innovation, customer
orientation, flexibility, accountability and organizational learning.
Interestingly, top growth companies place low value on bureaucracy, political
power and an orientation toward profit."
--Douglas Tuttle, Deloitte & Touche, July 1, 1995

"At least three-quarters of America's gain in export competitiveness can be
linked to [the high yen].  It is important to recognize that part of the
apparent transformation in the competitive picture is the result of factors
that don't have much to do with the fundamentals of productive performance."
--Richard Lester, director of the MIT Industrial Performance Center, October
17, 1995

"Plants that export are quite different from firms and plants that do not...In
almost all dimensions, the exporters' performance is preferable."
--Why Exports Really Matter, a report from the Manufacturing Institute, July
17, 1995

"The use of advanced manufacturing technologies confers benefits upon both
firms and employees.  Employees in technology-using firms are the recipients
of higher wages and stronger wage gains."
--John Baldwin, Statistics Canada, July 3, 1995

"The only sustainable competitive advantage you can achieve in the chemical
industry is through new technology, not cost, not service. Technology. And the
development of this new technology is essential just to stay even with the
competition." 
--Jim Trainham, Director of Engineering R&D at DuPont's Central R&D facility,
Oct. 2, 1995

"We're at a critical point-a crisis point-in that the printed board technology
and the assembly technology hasn't kept pace.  It's becoming a roadblock.  So
we need a significant effort to overcome that because the country that doesn't
have a printed circuit assembly industry probably soon isn't going to have
much of an electronics industry either."
--Thomas Dammrich, Executive Director of the Institute for Interconnecting and
Packaging Electronic Circuits, July 3, 1995

"There have been further losses among manufacturers of food processing
equipment and packaging and a decline in investment in food science and
technology research.  Both are bellweathers of erosion in technological
leadership and innovation."
--Al Clausi, President of the Institute of Food Technologists, July 17, 1995

"It cost [Wrangler] a little more to make that pair of jeans in the United
States than it would in Bangladesh, but, hey, they can make them today and
deliver them tomorrow, whereas if they order from Bangladesh, they have to wait
at least three or four months to get the boat back over here."
--Peter Butenhoff, President of TC Squared, Feb. 15, 1995


ON JAPAN'S LINGERING PROBLEMS -
AND AWESOME POTENTIAL

"Early on in the current recession, many writers blamed Japan's economic
misfortunes on external factors-appreciation of the yen, U.S.  trade pressure
and the bust of the economic 'bubble.' More recent writings about business
ties to the ominpresent bureaucracy may reflect deeper and more serious
thinking on what's wrong with Japanese ways."
--Ayako Doi, Editor of Japan Digest, Jan. 3, 1995

"Anybody who believes the Japanese are on their back is just wishfully thinking
and in two years, the Japanese are again going to be 10 feet tall,"
--George Gamota, Director of the Mitre Corp., July 17, 1995

"The Japanese are [still] 10 years ahead of us...It's not like we're gaining
anything in the manufacturing field."
--William Boulton, Auburn University's Center for International Commerce, Oct.
17, 1995

"The U.S. holds 95 percent of the world's microprocessor market. Why? Because
Intel, HP and TI have shorted the timeframe of the life of their chips by 50
percent. When they do that, the creative side dominates, whereas on the
improvement side, when the Japanese start to improve the Intel 486, the Pentium
is released. By the time they start to improve the Pentium, the next one is
coming out. The Japanese are really hurt by this strategy."
--John Preston, Director of Technology Development, MIT, Feb. 15, 1995

"At Nissan, industrial engineers will take video tapes of people doing a piece
of work and then the industrial engineer will go fast forward, repeat, fast
forward, repeat and time it and analyze the motion of the wrists and fingers
down to a level where they are then able to detail out how to do this process
the most efficient way and train their people that way. It was strange to see
how the person almost became part of the machine. They were almost one."
--Willie Kim, Group Leader for Manufacturing Engineering at McDonnell Douglas,
commenting about his experience working at Nissan for one year as part of the
Commerce Department's Japanese Manufacturing Fellowship Program, March 3, 1995.

The high yen, high production costs in Japan, and the threat of having
manufacturing plants closed not so much because of damage from an earthquake
but because of a disruption in Japan's finely tuned just-in-time delivery
system "is totally rewriting their books on their investment plans."  It's
especially true now that Japan's economy is picking up and companies are in
the process of deciding when and where to add production capacity.
--Sheridan Tatsuno, Japanese Analyst, shortly after the devastating Kobe
earthquake, Feb. 1, 1995

Commerce At Light Speed (CALS) is being viewed as a way to transform the
keiretsu structure of Japanese industry.  "CALS is drawing attention as a new
rule for transactions between companies that go beyond corporate groupings.
Even the automotive industry, which used to be well known for its keiretsu
relationships, is beginning to seek transactions beyond corporate groupings
such as introducing common parts and components."
--Norihiko Ishiguro, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Nov.
15, 1995

"[The lifetime employment] guarantee might be the structural deficiency of the
Japanese system that is resulting in the prolonged slowdown of the economy.
If that's the case, then they definitely need to change their management
style.  But if they see a recovery just as they used to when they went through
the typical business cycle, they may be able to maintain the old system."
--Joji Arai, Secretary General of the International Productivity Service,
August 7, 1995.


THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY

"We're in the fashion business and it's a little like the movie business.
There is a need for right-brain people in a car company-people who are highly
creative and who have an innate sense of the market.  Sometimes if you go
rigorously by what the marketing people say what needs to be done, you will be
guaranteed to do the wrong thing."
--Robert Lutz, President, Chrysler Corp., Feb. 1, 1995

"While we're researching agile, the Japanese are implementing it. And it is the
master of lean, which is Toyota, that is going and implementing it. We don't
have any more time to study,"
--Donald Runkle, Vice President of General Motors and General Manager of GM's
Delphi Saginaw division, May 15, 1995

"The advantage of having a single CAD/CAM system, and in particular one like
CATIA, lies primarily in the fact that the entire enterprise can easily access
and communicate product and process definition without the ever-present fear
that it will be misinterpreted either because of translation errors or [it] not
[being] up to date. We can directly trace much of our improved quality and
reduced cost to our implementation of a single CAD system."
--Frank Ewasyshyn, Vice President of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering,
Chrysler Corp., July 17, 1995

"Each of the Big Three companies has a long way to go in the cultural change
process which will result in a truly lean enterprise."
--Daniel Roos, Co-Director of MIT's International Motor Vehicle Program, Nov.
1, 1995

"The focus [of the Ford Production System] is on zero waste, zero defects, high
levels of machine reliability and measuring ourselves every step of the
process."
--Roman Krygier, Advanced Engineering and Process Leadership for Ford
Automotive, Nov. 1, 1995. 

LABOR

"For the sake of the shareholder and [executive] bonuses, [management is]
willing to keep the people down in Third World countries also. I don't see
corporations talking about real democracy in China or Korea. They don't give a
shit about democracy over there. They don't give a shit about it because they
don't really know what democracy is because they don't have democracy in their
own plants in the United States."
--George Korpias, President, International Association of Machinists, Dec. 1,
1995

"True apprenticeships [for tool and die makers] have gone away, which is very
bad. What happens is you have this group of journeymen whose average age now is
61 years old, so it won't be long before there won't be anybody left to train
the new people coming into the field. It's an urgent thing."
--Sam Hart, a machinist at the Oak Ridge Y-12 production facility, Feb.  15,
1995

THE NEW CONGRESS

"The bar has been raised with this session of Congress in terms of someone
showing us that we are making a prudent investment. A prudent investment isn't
good enough. A desirable investment isn't good enough any more. A
well-intentioned investment won't make it in this environment. The old game is
over. And it really is over because times have changed."
--Rep. Bob Franks (R-N.J.), Feb. 1, 1995

"The long-term commitment of the country to research and development is in
jeopardy.  There is a real chance that we'll wind up with a budget resolution
or a set of priorities that do not reflect the same level of national
commitment to research and development that we've had since the second world
war."
--Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), May 1, 1995

Q: "The freshmen organized in the House right now want to get rid of the whole
Department of Commerce."
Good: "I find that one just absolutely mind boggling. How could you possibly be
a group of people who are presumably pro business and want to abolish the only
advocate for business in the cabinet?"

"Q:  But they come over here and see people walking the halls like zombies,
doing nothing."
Good: "That's bull_, come on. I can go to anybody's establishment and find
zombies. And I can find them on Capitol Hill. There are a hell of a lot of
people in this building who are career folks who really work very hard and are
very smart and do a good job.  Sure there is stuff that doesn't get done very
well, nobody is going to argue that. But a hell of a lot gets done pretty well.
The other point is I get a little bit aggravated about the fact that the
suggestion is that I checked my brains when I came here."
-Mary Good, Undersecretary of Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce,
April 17, 1995

"I don't think the Chrysler bill is going to go any place. They [Republican
freshmen] worked solo. You're going to privatize NIST? Over my dead body."
--Rep. Constance Morella (R-Md), Chairman of the House Science Committee's
technology subcommittee, June 15, 1995

The House Republicans "are not anxious to cut off something [pork-barrel
projects] that they got a good deal of benefit out of. The new [committee]
chairmen are chomping at the bit to get some goodies for themselves."
--Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.), Ranking Minority Member of the House Science
Committee, March 3, 1995

"We've been doing technology with industry and triggering things for the
commercial marketplace forever.  We keep kidding ourselves about why we're
doing the projects.  But I like doing it from out behind the curtain [of the
military].  It's risky, and I don't know if it will last, but we owe it to the
country to do it correctly and be honest about it."
--Arati Prabhakar, Director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, June 1, 1995, discussing the fate of the Advanced Technology
Program, which is still up in the air.

"The National Association of Manufacturers believes the disproportionate large
cuts proposed in newer R&D programs are a mistake."
--NAM policy statement on federal R&D budget cuts, Sept. 1, 1995


NATIONAL LABS, R&D AND UNIVERSITIES

"I wonder if the new Congress realizes how angry U.S. high-tech companies are
becoming at what they perceive as the unfair competition they are increasingly
encountering from the federal laboratories for diminishing federal science and
technology spending. In too many instances, federal laboratories established to
serve the public interest seem to have evolved into institutions bent on their
own survival whether that serves the public interest or not."
-Brenda Forman, Director of Marketing Policy for Lockheed Martin, March 15,
1995

"It is now part of every program manager's job not only to develop great new
military relevant technologies, but to take the responsibility of determining
how it will get built."
--Michael McGrath, manufacturing program manager at the Defense Department's
Advanced Research Projects Agency, March 15, 1995

"...One of the difficulties with ARPA is that it has grown so big that-at least
in my view-its character is threatened. There is a danger in ARPA getting too
big, both in changing its character and it becoming too bureaucratic. That is
not necessarily good for an entrepreneurial organization. I'm trying very hard
to shrink the agency. It is not a popular notion. ARPA is very entrepreneurial.
The object of the game is to get all the money."
--Larry Lynn, Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Oct. 17, 1995

"When Alice went looking for a land of nonsense, she found it. It was the
university."
-John White, Dean of the College of Engineering, Georgia Institute of
Technology, July 17, 1995

"Today, the future has no organized political constituency."
--Charles Vest, President, MIT, Oct. 2, 1995

A 1996 MANUFACTURING RESOLUTION: EDUCATION REPLACES COMPETITIVENESS AT NATION'S
PRIMARY CONCERN


Last year was one of the best ever for U.S. manufacturers and will go down as
the year that manufacturing was finally recognized as being as important to the
country's future as financing has been for the past decade or more.

Thank goodness. The nation couldn't wait much longer for manufacturing to
undergo an image change both in the public and corporate worlds.

But now the manufacturing community has to build on the good news of 1995.

Education has replaced competitiveness as the buzzword of the 1990s. As well it
should.

During Christmas break, I drove my family from Washington, D.C., to Toronto, a
10-hour trip. About halfway between the two cities lies Corning, N.Y., near the
Pennsylvania border. On the way back from Toronto, we stopped at the Corning
Glass Museum.

The museum includes a tour of the Steuben glass factory, which my children
found to be "awesome, cool," they say.  They had no idea of how glass was
made, and could not believe their eyes when a craftsman making a $400
paperweight easily cut the hot glass with a pair of shears.

The factory was spotless and modern. The workers obviously enjoyed what they
were doing. And the products they made were works are art-expensive, but worth
it-given the amount of work and skill needed to make them, say my kids, who
enthusiastically said they'd love to learn the craft.

Having never thought of it before, they realized how important glass is in our
culture and that it's been made for more than 3,000 years. They experienced the
entire  process, from the gathering of the raw materials to the grinding,
polishing and inspection of the final product.  "I loved it," said my
12-year-old daughter.

If you are the owner or manager of a manufacturing plant, show it off to the
children in your community AND their parents AND the press. 

Manufacturing is reclaiming its place in American society, but it needs a push.
Making products is sexy, vibrant, high-tech, exciting and rewarding. This
message has to get out to millions of people in the country who are fretting
about the future.

Keep telling the story.

--Richard McCormack
