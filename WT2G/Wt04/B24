Day 22</H3>



At 0700 hrs we got a message on the radio, pilot on board at 0800 hrs
to come alongside. Ya hoo!


<P>Mooring lines ashore, gangway down and a spruce up around the ship.

<P>The lounge was packed with media for the press conference. The ship 
full of people. 

<P>In the early afternoon some of the crew went along to support a peaceful 
demonstration, organised by local environmental groups outside the 
Chinese embassy. Protesting their continuation to test nuclear weapons.
Representatives from the Philippines, Japan, Sth. Korea, Tahiti, 
Indonesia and Germany spoke on behalf of their people in supporting 
the message to the Chinese to stop testing.

<P>Later on, a few of us went to the Seamen’s’ Mission for a couple of 
hours. It is a well run place  where you can enjoy a swim, sit in the 
shade, catch up on mail and have a quiet drink.

<P>Back to the ship where in the evening there was a reception on board 
for some politicians, representatives of embassies, leaders of local 
NGO's and media.

<P>Some of the crew were impressed and nearly bought to tears as a group 
of under privileged children, who were either deaf or blind made a 
performance of singing and dancing, bringing a message for peace. The 
heli deck was transformed into a outdoor cafe and a very tasty catered 
meal was served. Afterwards people were given a tour of the ship.

<P>The Philippine people are very friendly and it is obvious a lot of 
hard work has gone into the preparation of the ship visiting.              

<P>In contrast to the obvious problems around us, of the pollution in 
this bay and city and the hard life that many people are living in, it 
is heartening to meet so many people who are working extremely 
hard and are fervent in their determination to find solutions and make a 
positive change to their environment here in the Philippines.

MV Greenpeace / PC 8023<BR>     
Noon Position: Alongside, Manila Harbour
<BR>
June 8th, 1996<BR>
Day 23</H3>



Friday morning and we had a open boat. Did not seem much
different from the day before, many people on board, but that is
good  as one of the purposes of our visit is to make contact with
people.

<P>Something I have often  heard mentioned by the local people since being here is a story about a mine tailings dam in the Marinduque province that broke and poisoned most of the Boac river. The livelihood and health of many people was destroyed.
Also in the past day there has been a `red tide', an algae bloom
outbreak and six children have died from eating shellfish.

<P>Most of the day all our new crew mates have been arriving on 
board. I'm sure it is even more bewildering for them than it is 
for us. Now there are 32 of us.

<P>In the afternoon I went to the Seamen’s Mission and had one-and-a-half hours of frantic letter writing before coming back to the ship, which was being prepared for a concert in the evening.

<P>Local NGO's had organised 5 bands to play, all good musicians.
Roland our Tahitian delegate impressed us all by joining in with one of the bands, getting the crowd going and feet tapping. A 
musician from way back. Many of us got a good sweat up, dancing 
in this tropical heat!

<P>It seemed a unusual setting for a concert. The ship alongside a 
working dock, huge coils of steel, pallets of timber, trucks and 
forklifts driving crazily everywhere. When you are walking on this quayside you really have to keep your wits about you - forklifts 
seem to lose their  loads regularly. In amongst all this 
bedlam a couple of hundred people enjoying the music.

<P>Just before the farewell concert the crane`packed a sad'. A seal 
gave way on the winding drum and hydraulic oil was pouring onto 
the deck. A mad rush by the crew to clean up the mess and the 
engineers checking out the problem. Due to having to get another 
seal our departure has been delayed to 1800 hrs Saturday instead 
of our intended ETD of 0800 hrs.

<P>This has been our 3rd delay since leaving NZ and I find it a 
little bit unusual. But tomorrow we will be making our way to 
China.

<BR clear=all><BR>Well, the ship has finally left Manila, and the campaign is in earnestly under way. Oh, by the way, my name is Dima Litvinov, and I am taking over from Tanya on writing up these updates.  I flew into Manila to join the ship from Sweden, where I work as the nuclear campaigner.  Now I am on the ship as one of the team of campaigners. We are the ones responsible for having contacts with the media, and communicating the Greenpeace word in general.

<P>Yesterday morning the ship was expected to sail at 10am but as it turned out the crane had not been fixed by then.  A crowd of journalists were waiting on the dock, while Dominic and Bob were working in 40 degree heat astride the crane. That was when the missing part was finally delivered.

<P>Well, the journalists' boredom disappeared right quick when the news came in that the Chinese actually went ahead and tested a nuclear charge in the morning. A bit of a feeding frenzy ensued, with camera's lining up to get interviews and the sat phone ringing off the hook with queries from around the world.
The mood on the ship changed as well.  All of a sudden there was this sense of urgency.  We had to get away from Manila, we had to get to  Shanghai, we had to let the Chinese know that this just won't do, that they are not alone on this planet.

<P>I, meanwhile, am in the galley, running between the chopping board (beef stroganoff and spirals for dinner today, and with 32 people on board and 45 degrees in the galley the newly revived Lynda needs all the help we can give her) and the heli deck to give interviews.

<P>The dinner is ready at six, and so is the crane.  We push off.  The great folks who helped us out in the Philippines are on the dock.  Athena, Ariel, Athena's brothers, the guys and girls from the Philippine Anti-Nuclear coalition.  All the hugs and tears on deck did not make it easier to see them disappear on the horizon.
As we are beginning to pick up some steam we pass a Filipino bulk carrier.  The name - Rainbow Joy.  Wow.  An unknown member of the Greenpeace flotilla? Manila shows us her best side for our departure - the setting sun glitters in pinks and purples off the skyscrapers, the lines of palm trees along the shore line are bending in the light breeze. The air is clean. The night is full of stars and the routine of the sea is setting in. 

<P>Good night.  Dima

June 10th, 1996<BR>
Day 25</H3>





Well, it's not all beautiful sunsets and meetings with ships with
auspicious names.  We hit a nice force 7 yesterday, and a lot of the
new arrivals on board were getting quite sick.  It'll take a couple of days before
everyone finds their sea legs -- hopefully by the time we arrive at the 12 mile
limit off of Shanghai.


<P>The ship is really cruising, the seas have calmed down a lot since 
yesterday when we caught a favourable current, so we were doing up to 
14 knots for a while.  Well, we are a bit late, so that's good.

<P>The e-mail  messages from Greenpeace offices are very inspiring.
Around the world the people are pouring out their outrage about the
Chinese test, and pouring out their support for this trip  --  at least 13
governments have already said they are angered by the test - and on the weekend too!  I thought they 
all played golf!  Greenpeace activists in about 17 countries are protesting at the embassies.  Faxes of 
support for our ship are coming in from people, from parliamentarians, from 
political parties, etc.

<P>Meanwhile, we are getting ready for the birthday party (Shhhhhhh!) .  
Helen's is today, and Shaun's is tomorrow.  Everyone is holding their 
breath:  Will Lynda be able to make a cake in this heat?  We made 
the cards last night, during Jeanette's and Tanya's watch (12-4 AM).  
They turned out to be quite nice -- enlarged copies of the Monopoly 
"Get out of jail free" cards, with Greenpeace on the bottom. Humour helps to remind us of the very 
positive role we are playing  - especially when we know that the environment has just suffered yet 
another nuclear test. 

<P>And what could be more positive than a world free of nuclear weapons?

About 100 miles east of the Chinese coast.
<BR>
June 11th, 1996<BR>
Day 26</H3>


It is a beautiful day.  The sun is reflecting off the sea, the sea is blue-
blue.  Every couple of minutes the flying fish  dive out from under
the bow of the ship, flying for a few meters before crashing back
into the waves. Last night the phosphorecence sparkling in the bow
wave was like tiny fireworks around the ship.


<P>The mood is getting a bit more somber and collected, as we get closer to our destination.  The talk is a 
bit more subdued, less and less light hearted banter, more speculation on what awaits 
us, comparing with similar campaigns of the past -- Moruroa, Russian nuclear testing zone, etc.

<P>In the evening -- Helen's birthday party, Lynda and Stephanie did 
make that cake -- excellent -- chocolate with lovely jam.  

<P>A crew meeting in the evening. Updates from the Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) 
negotiations in Geneva, are not the most heartening, but the trip is certainly having the effect of 
bringing the world's attention to the nuclear testing issue and to the CTBT talks. AT a time when the 
world truly does seem to be on the verge of ending nuclear testing, that spotlight on the negotiation 
process is so very important. Those people whose job it is to negotiate this treaty need to know that the 
world is watching them and that what the world wants is to be free of nuclear testing.

<P>The representatives from Asian anti-nuclear groups on board (there 
are four --Leo from Indonesia, Myra  from Philippines, Jae from  
South Korea and  Roland from Tahiti, Kazue from Japan) are 
settling into the Greenpeace family -- I think they may have been a 
little shy, and not quite used to the Greenpeace style of life on the 
ship at first.  But we are all in this together, for the same reason,  so 
I think they are beginning  to feel more at home.

<P>It's funny, how familiar this adrenaline rush, as we approach 
the unknown, and potentially unwelcoming coast.

Day 27</H3>
<H3>UPDATE FROM XAVIER PASTOR ON BOARD MV GREENPEACE</H3>

<P>At 11.55 (Chinese time) we entered the territorial waters of China

<P>At 12.30 we were at the anchorage point of Changjiang Kou, near the mouth of the Yangtze River and requested a pilot.

<P>At 13.50 we got a radio transmission informing us were illegally in Chinese internal waters. We were asked to "stop our illegal actions and leave the Chinese territorial waters immediately".

<P>At 13.57 two coastguard vessels from the Port Authorities, with naval personnel, marine border guards and naval sailors came alongside both sides of the MV Greenpeace and we were calmly boarded by approx. 70 soldiers of the three institutions. They were not carrying weapons, but an enormous number of video cameras, microphones, photocameras and tape-recorders. They took control of the ship for the next two hours. They prevented all communications to and from the ship and placed guards throughout the ship and by our inflatables.



<P>Officers from the Port Authority and from the Naval Border Guards met in the Captain’s cabin with Capt. Ulf Brigander and senior campaigner Xavier Pastor plus our two interpreters. 10 or so soldiers with cameras and video cameras recorded the meeting, as did our own cameras and a couple of the journalists on board the ship.

<P>The read us two statements, stating very formally all the laws we had already violated and asked us to leave Chinese territorial waters immediately. We asked for one hour to consider their order. After talking it over we told them we would leave only if they acted on behalf of the Chinese government and listened to a statement from us to stop nuclear testing and commit to a CTBT, and also receive a number of anti-testing presents we had brought from different parts of the world.

<P>Meanwhile up to eight Navy and Coastguard vessels,  including a number of gun boats, loaded with many more soldiers surrounded the MV Greenpeace.

<P>The Chinese officers first did not want to receive our statements or presents until we were proceeding outside the territorial waters, but we said we wanted to do it while in the anchorage with all our crew on the heli-deck. They accepted and so the ceremony took place with about 100 people and nearly 40 cameras of all kind. 

<p>View this  <a href="movie02.html">movie 2</a>

<P>On one of the Coastguard vessels there appeared to be some members of the Shanghai (free?) media, but they were not allowed to come on-board our ship. They were also filming. Our campaigner Dima Litvinov tried to hand the crew of the coastguard vessel a number of Greenpeace China bags, but he got a cold - 'Please co-operate. We already have bags from one of the  officers'.

<P>Once we finished, one of the more tough officials said: “Now, leave China immediately! - They left our ship and we heaved the anchor and started to proceed towards international waters at approx. 16.00.  The coastguards escorted us (and are still doing so as we write this update outside of Chinese waters).


<P>The general feeling here is that we have achieved the most  that was realistically possible. We crossed the line despite their serious warnings, we went into territorial waters six miles and were 'arrested' during the 2-3 hours that the Chinese navy took control of the ship. We managed to bring the message to Shanghai that we have wanted to for so long - 'Stop nuclear testing now and commit to a truly Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty'.

<BR>
Day 27</H3>


<P><B>Well, we did it!</B>

<P>I know this is being put up late, but we had a bit of communicas problem
(our radio room being occupied by the Chinese navy and marine border
guards).

<P>We sailed into the Chinese waters at around noon.  Already before crossing the
magic 12 mile mark a 2 prop naval plane circled the ship about 8 times, getting
a good look at us, probably filming.

<P>As we sailed in, the people began to gather on the bridge.  The fog was 
quite thick, ghosts of ships' silhouettes looming in the distance.  To  our
great surprise no warship met us at the boundary itself, so we proceded in. It was 
Jeanette's watch, but the bridge was full of people -- deckhands off watch, 
journalists, our own camera crews.  The tension mounted. 

<P>By 1:00 we were at anchorage, where we decided to wait and figure out a way 
to take us in by inflatable or ship to the docks.  But this was not to be.  
Suddenly the foggy silhouettes around us resolved into shapes of gunboats 
rapidly approaching the MV Greenpeace.  The radio came to life: "MV 
Greenpeace , you are here illegally, you must stop immediately".

<P>Without having much chance to reply that we indeed were already stopped, we 
were boarded. Two ships came along side on either side. About 70 border 
guards and navy personnel got on board.  The radio room, bridge and the 
engine room were taken over.

<P>The weirdest thing was the number of cameras -- at least every other man 
coming on board had a video or a stills camera.  I bet the MV Greenpeace has 
not had so many cameras even in a press conference during the height of the 
Moruroa protests.

<P>Ulf and Xavier were led to the  captain’s cabin, where they were told in no 
uncertain terms that the ship had to leave the territorial waters.  We replied
that we would not do this, without first doing what we had come to do -- 
delivering the message of peace from the people of the world to the Chinese 
authorities.

<P>Negotiations ensued.  Finally it was agreed -- we would be allowed to present 
our message. The crew and the Chinese military gathered on the helicopter deck.

<P>Kazue Suzuki brought forth 1000 paper origami cranes, folded in the 
memory of the victims of Hiroshima.  I brought the photographs of Swedish 
children, sent by their parents, and read out one of the letters -- "Dear
China,  we love our child.  We want her  to live in the world free of nuclear weapons.  
Please stop nuclear testing".  Lynda brought out drawings made by the New 
Zealand kids.

<P>At the end of the ceremony, Ningning (our Philippine Chinese translator) read
in  Chinese our appeal to the Chinese government to stop trying to sabotage an 
agreement on banning all nuclear tests, and to cancel the planned test series.

<P>We did it.  I really wasn't sure we would be able to this time.  We are now 
sailing toward Hong Kong.  The war for peace is moving on to Geneva, and 
world capitals.  The MV Greenpeace is getting ready for the new battle.  Next 
stop -- Japan.

Day 30</H3>


<P><B>Kiaora,  It  is Tanya back again. Sorry about a  couple  of  days
being missed.</B>

<P>As  you  heard  from  Dima, we made it  6  miles  inside  Chinese
territorial  waters and within a couple of hours were making  our
way  back out. We are now approx. one and a half days  from  Hong
Kong, 35 miles off the coast of China, in the Taiwan strait.

<P>There is an interesting mood on board the ship. A crew of 32  people
of  16 nationalities  came together for the for the sole  purpose 
of  taking a message to the Chinese, and no one knowing  what  the 
 outcome of doing this would be.

<P>Greenpeace began in the 1970's because of nuclear testing and for 
the  past 25 years it  has been a passionate issue,  tackled  from 
many different angles. To have the CTBT signed by all the nuclear 
states,  unconditionally, is the beginning of the `light  at  the 
end of the tunnel'.

<P>Before crossing into territorial waters there was a quiet tension 
on board and now a day later I think most of us are replaying  in 
our minds what happened.

<P>We are 32 people with 32 views, working as a team. 
Some  are frustrated that maybe we could of done more. Experimenting  and  testing  nuclear 
weapons specifically designed to destroy life, is serious. We are 
all the guardians of this planet and should not have to tolerate the “games” that the power brokers of this world play. Others  felt  we  made the best  of  the  situation,  approaching 
peacefully  but with determination and getting our message across. 


<P>But most importantly, this small ship was representing millions of 
people, and we are just a little part of the big picture.
Many of the people who sent messages of support as we crossed the 
line  have already spent years of their lives working  towards  a 
nuclear  free world and will continue to do so. They have been a  brake 
on this craziness  and the more people pushing the brake  pedal  the 
sooner it is going to stop.

<BR>
Day 31</H3>



<P><B>I think for the majority of crew that joined the ship in Manila,
the prospect of arriving in Hong Kong is very appealing.</B>

<P>Greg, the Reuters' journalist has been heard around the ship
singing songs like, `I want to be free....'

<P>Gis, our Russian deckhand/campaigner has been withdrawn these
last couple of days, mourning the disappearance of his toothbrush
and accusing innocent people of bizarre crimes.

<P>There is a small group of people who like to congregate on the
Monkey Island (the deck above the bridge) in the evening and talk
about the birds and the bees. There is another small group that
seem to be doing a lot of buzzing and chirping!

<P>Dima, another of our campaigners who was born in Russia, moved 
to America when a teenager and now lives in Sweden with his 
Finnish wife who he met in Equador (and lovely children) has 
taken it upon himself to keep Jeannette and I company on the 
midnight - four watch.Making the hours fly by as he insists on 
singing us Russian songs and telling rather exaggerated stories 
on any subject you could imagine. He claims to be a insomniac, 
but I think really, the rest of his cabin mates have locked him 
out of the cabin!


<P>Sunday morning, 0600 hrs we will be dropping anchor to clear 
immigration and then go on to a mooring buoy.
This involves taking the anchor off the cable and chaining the 
ship to the buoy, the anchor weighs a few ton.


<P>Then it will be people ashore to attend a press conference and 
others coming out to the ship. Over the next few days many crew 
will be leaving, and they have been a good bunch to sail with. We 
will hold a couple of open days to the public and have some small 
functions on board. In between trying to get general ship work 
done and preparing for the next leg of the voyage. On the 20th  of
June we leave for Nagasaki, Japan - one of the two cities devastated by nuclear bombs in 1945.

Day 33</H3>




<P>Hi everyone, this is Lynda (the cook) here. I'm taking over
writing the daily diary from Tanya, who is leaving us in a couple
of days. She is going to catch the Trans Siberian railway across
China and Russia. One of the sadder realities of ship life is saying good-bye to after living together in such a small space - it certainly accelerates the intensity of personal relationships
and ensures that strong friendships are made.


<P>We had a great party a couple of nights ago and it seemed many 
people had a good time letting go of the tension that had built 
up in the past couple of weeks as we were preparing for our visit 
to Shanghai.

<P>On one hand we are ordinary ships' crew carrying out the 
functions necessary for the task of getting our boat from one 
place to another, and on the other hand we are each of us a 
 ` vessel ' carrying the love, hopes and dreams of millions of 
people for a peaceful,safe world for generations to come.
Personally I have found the responsibility an honour - if a bit 
overwhelming at times, and am truly heartened by the contact with 
individual supporters that are able to visit us.

<P>So, here we are in HK  winding down from China and gearing up for 
the toxic waste tour of Japan - although not before visiting Nagasaki on our final port of call to highlight the urgent need for a total nuclear test ban. Nagaskai is the Japanese city that was devastated by a nuclear bomb in 1945,  three days after Hiroshima. The Mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been very vocal against China for its continued nuclear testing and in asking them to join a total nuclear test ban.  It will be an honour to meet the people for whom this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty must mean so much - finally an end to nuclear testing is in sight and hopefully with that we can take the first step to a truly nuclear free world. But first we must convince China to cancel its next planned test and to drop its insistence for a review of these so-called “Peaceful” nuclear explosions.

<P>Tomorrow is bunkering, the term used for refuelling the ship, so 
all the engineers will have to be on hand for that.

<P>My major preparations at each port involve stocking 
up on fresh fruit and veges, so yesterday was shopping day - what an 
experience! I couldn't believe the array of exotic vegetables and 
animals for sale at the city marke. There were cages full of frogs, turtles, chickens, bins full of live shellfish and fish everywhere. Trolly loads of pigs dead but whole, waiting to be cut up.  The 
stall holders seemed to delight in holding up unidentified bits 
and enticing me to buy them..We must have looked hilarious as 
I ran around deciding what to buy while Steph, our Chinese translator from Germany 
bargained and paid,and the others ferried everything 
to our stockpile. Most other people there were just buying enough 
for the day so the stallholders I bought off were delighted as I 
stocked up  rather extravagantly in their terms) for 2 weeks.
Oh the joys of shopping in exotic ports!

<P>  Well this has been a bit of a rave hope it makes up for the 
silence of the last few days.
 <P>  Til tomorrow 
               <P> Love Lynda

Day 34</H3>


<P>
      Wow what a day! We had our first public open day and the
response was wonderful.Over 800 people arrived,all Cantonese
apart from maybe 10 westeners, and considering some of them
waited for up to 3 hours on the wharf before they were ferried
out to us,I'd say the day was very very successful. The media
coverage of our visit to China was high profile in Hong Kong and
sparked a real following amongst people here.
 
<P> It seems like we're regarded more as `eco stars'  rather than
`eco warriors'.Cameras were clicking everywhere as crew were
invited to pose with our visitors. Their excitment was contagious
and I found I was on a real high by the end of the day.
  
<P>A Chinese T.V. crew even came to interview me while I was
cooking! They wanted me to extoll the virtues of vegetables. I
found it difficult to maintain my composure while the interviewer 
stood there with a large bunch of celery in one hand, microphone 
in the other and asked me questions in Chinese. I was trying 
desperately not to burn the onions, had tears running down my face 
because their juice was so strong-a real picture of galley 
glamour-and doing my best to give intelligent/coherent answers in English.

 
<P>  Later on in the day a group of students from Sha Tin college 
came and presented Ulf - our captain - with a cheque for $1600 Hong 
Kong that they had raised for Greenpeace.They had been collecting 
since the French resumed testing at Moruroa last year,and when 
they sent a letter of concern to the French representatives here, 
the respnse was to ridicule them publicly in the newspaper. The energy 
and enthusiasm of the students was very inspiring and bode well for the beginnings 
of an official Greenpeace Office in Hong Kong when it happens.

 
<P>            Bye for now... 
<P> Love Lynda.

Hong Kong harbour

June 20th, 1996 
<BR>
Day 35</H3>




<P>Hello again,
<P>          Well it's 2045hrs (8.85pm) and we're steaming out of
Hong Kong harbour. I've been standing on the main deck surrounded
by reflections, both internal and external. Outside the night
time dazzle of trillions of lights bounce off and over the water.
This is Hong Kong at it's most magical. The intensity of colour
dyes the clouds with rainbow washes,while the first sliver of a
waxing moon surveys all.Not quite out shone by this earthly
show,but nearly.
  <P>  When we first arrived here I felt a large shock. Coming as I
do from a sparsley populated area of New Zealand,I found it
difficult to comprehend so many people living in such a small
space. I thought Sydney might have prepared me a little for this

<P>- no way! Much to some peoples amusement I was very scared of
getting lost and tried to explain that while I can find my way in
the dark with no moon and no torch all around my surroundings at 
home and not be bothered,the lack of reference points and 
visibility due to enormous buildings had me in amild state of 
panic for the first couple of days. It's all relative I guess and 

<P>Im sure that faced with the vast spaces that I'm used to ,some 
people might get the same feelings of culture shock.
   It's been another busy day again with hundreds more people 
coming to visit. Unfortuneately some had to miss out as there 
just wasn't enough time for every one to be shown around before 
we had to make ready to leave. 
<P>   There is always a flurry before the mooring lines are let go 
and this was heightened by the fact we were having to `let go' of 
Jeannette and Tanya who we left behind.Also fond goodbyes to 
Anne,Bruce and the volunteers they had managed to whip up out of 
nowhere a few days before we arrived.

 <P>  As always though,whenever we say goodbye to some there are 
always new people to say hello to and today welcomed on board 
Sabine the new assistant cook from Germany,Stan (short for 
Felicity)our english deckhand and Alexander our Russian chief 
engineer.Also travelling with us to Japan is Clement who was my 
shopping guide the other day.Clement is an ex Honk Kong chinese 
who now lives in Canada and is on a short contract with us.So 
some new people to find out about in the next few weeks.
 <P>  Whooops time flies on this computor. The novelty of getting 
over being able to actually use one hasn't worn off yet. Must get 
back to the galley though and do my last few chores before 
bedtime.

<P>      Bye for now    
              <P>   Love Lynda.

<P>     Hello again,
                Sorry for the silence during the last couple of
days, I'm still getting to grips with this machine and trying not
to bother Neil to much with my limited proficiency at getting
into where I'm supposed to be.
<P>    The days are rolling along here at sea, getting back into the
rythmn of `normal' ship life away from the distractions  and
stimuli of being in port. Last night we had a barbeque on the
poop deck. Frank our bosun has discovred a mean talent for firing
up the barbie and got everything set up very nicely. He'd got
some willing helpers to set up tables and chairs with name tags
and a seating plan of all things, so it was very swish indeed as
we sat out there eating a yummy dinner watching the sky's last
pastel shades giving in to the black velvet night. Sounds great
eh? It was lovely to have a leisurely dinner and take time to 
reconnect with everyone again. During the course of a normal day 
there isn't much time to relax with everyone together at the same 
time and somehow a barbeque gives a bit of a festive air,and 
people linger abit longer instead of scurrying of to their next 
task.
 <P> There were a few moments of absolute peace and tranquility 
today. We've been making really good time due to a fairly strong 
current pushing us towards Japan so Ulf made a decision to turn 
offthe engines and drift for the next half a day or so. I was 
about half way through making lunch when suddenly everything went 
silent on the boat,and for a few minutes before the generators 
sparked up again all I could hear was the gentle slish of waves 
as they slapped the side of the boat. There is something purely 
magical around the feeling of being suspended on the ocean 
courtesy of this vessel no engine power and rocking to and fro, 
the current moving us along at it's lesure. Actually Helen told 
me we were moving at about 1.5 knots and in the direction that we 
would be going if we were under our own power. That seems pretty 
cool to me!
  <P> Always,every day I take a few moments to silently thank all 
the effort and energy that everyone puts in to making all of the 
Greenpeace ships stay in the water and remember how lucky I am to 
have the opportunity to experience the wonders of life on the 
sea.
 <P>  Well my bed is calling and I,m looking forward to a great 
sleep with no engine noise.
     <P> Night all
      <P>    Love Lynda.

MV Greenpeace / PC 8023     June 24, 1996

 
<P>  Hello all,
         
<P>  Just when I thought it was safe to trust my new found computor skills this damn machine has had me in fits of frustration for the last twenty minutes! Anyway here I am.
 
<P> Big news of the day is that Dominic caught a big mahi-mahi off the poopdeck this morning. He has a fishing line set up with a bungy rope arrangement on it and he'd had it out all morning and when he went to check it there was this beautiful blue/yellow fish there. It will be great for dinner tomorrow.   

<P>The deck crew have been working hard again today. As Neil Young's song says `rust never sleeps' and there is a constant cycle of chipping and painting. Having the ship holed up in Hao atoll all those months took it's toll on the general condition of things and the deckhands have had a big job getting it all up to a ship shape standard again. 

<P>We are now less than two days sailing time from our destination of Nagasaki,  one of the two Japanese cities that was devastated by a nuclear bomb. The bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was a plutonium bomb. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima was a uranium bomb. It takes much less plutonium to get a greater explosive force, than it takes of uranium. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima was called Little Boy and was 13 kilotonnes while the bomb dropped on Nagasaki was called Fat Man and was 20 kilotonnes. 

<P>I have seen photographs taken in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombs were dropped and all that is left of people is their shadow - outlines on walls or footpaths where they were literally vaporised by the force of the blast. 


<P>The crew will go to the Nagasaki Peace Park on Thursday for a remembrance ceremony. I just hope that the delegates sitting in Geneva trying to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty will also remember the people of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.


<P> We hear from Geneva that there is some disagreement about how and when the treaty would take effect and that this could lead to delays. If the wording of the treaty isn’t agreed by the end of this week then it will not be ready for signing before the end of this year. Hopefully by going to Nagasaki we will be able to remind people that this treaty is about stopping the testing of nuclear weapons that are designed to kill people - and that is why the world wants a CTBT now, not next year or the year after. 
    

<P>See you 
          
 Love Lynda.

<P>  Hi again,

<P>Well we get to Nagasaki tomorrow and I'm really looking 
forward to catching up with Kazue, the Japanese campaigner who came to China on-board the MV. One of the things organised for a couple of days after we get to Japan is a march to the Nagasaki
Peace Park to lay some flowers at the memorial that commemorates the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. A fitting end to this tour. 22,000 people died the day that bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and another 17,000 died in the next four months - there were in total 64,000 victims of the Nagasaki nuclear bomb. 
<P> I'm covered with goose bumps as I write this and reflect on the horrors that occurred in those two cities. I'm certain that my own personal resolve as well as our collective Greenpeace one, to stop any form of nuclear testing forever, will be strengthened 1000 fold by this ceremony at the Peace Park. It takes place on Friday which is also the last day of the CTBT talks in Geneva. 
<P>I hope that all of you who read this will give a thought to our journey to the park and all that  it signifies - but mainly I hope that the delegates in Geneva will remember what nuclear testing leads to and that they have the power in their hands to free this world of all nuclear explosions for all time.
            
<P>Goodnight,
<P> Lynda.

Position: Noon Pos: Matsugae dock, Nagasaki Harbour

<BR>
June 27th, 1996 
<BR>
Day 42</H3>




<P>We held a press conference on-board the ship today to tell the Japanese media why we had come to Nagasaki. Our captain Ulf told the media: "We have come from a protest voyage to China, which still 
insists on testing nuclear weapons, to Japan, which has experienced the horror of nuclear destruction.  
<P>Our message in China was simple and today in Nagasaki we repeat that message to all parties in the treaty talks -- ban all nuclear testing now." There was a good turn out and I hope that means the message will get back to the delegates in Geneva that they need to remember Nagasaki and get this test ban signed, now. 
<P>A few hours after the press conference we heard that France had delivered a speech to the CTBT conference saying they were prepared to adopt the treaty. This a good sign because France is one of the five nuclear weapons states, and the first to go public with an intention to get this treaty finished. Although it is pretty ironic that Jacques Chirac is turning out to be almost a ‘good guy' on this one. But I guess that is pretty easy for him since he got to do all the tests he needed last year.
<P>Maybe now France is being so helpful in getting a CTBT Jacques Chirac can talk with John Major at the G-7 meeting in Lyon and convince him to change the UK’s position at the CTBT talks. The UK has been one of four countries (Russia, China and Pakistan) who are refusing to compromise on how the treaty would take effect and this is apparently one of the major obstacles to the treaty being finalised.


<P>After the press conference Kazue went with Ulf to meet the Mayor of Nagasaki, 
Iccho Itoh, who agreed to contact the embassies of those four countries and impress upon them the need for compromise. Tomorrow we go to the Peace Park. Being in the very place where a nuclear bomb was dropped and meeting the wonderful people of Nagasaki makes me wonder why the CTBT delegates find it so hard to agree on a way to stop nuclear testing. From here it seems clear.

<B>
<P>Love,

<P> Lynda

<H3>CREW BIOGRAPHIES: MV GREENPEACE VOYAGE TO SHANGHAI JUNE
1996</H3>
 

<B>Ulf Birgander, 44, Captain<BR>
Born Linkoping, Sweden.</B>


<P>I started sailing soon after finishing school. I  studied to get my Mates’ ticket and then 
went on to become a captain,  sailing worldwide on a number of different Swedish 
ships. I got involved with the Swedish anti-nuclear movement in 1979 and then joined  
Greenpeace at the end of 1991.
<P><HR>

<P><B>Ken Ballard, 39, First Mate<BR>
Born Guilford,  Surrey,  UK.</B>
 <P>
I first became involved with GP in 1978 when the 
fledgling organisation had just obtained its first vessel 
in Europe, the Rainbow Warrior. Before that I had done a 
conventional Merchant Navy apprenticeship as Navigating 
Officer and sailed world wide on bulk and general cargo 
<P>
ships. From that time I have worked for Greenpeace on 
most of their ships and taken part in many of the 
campaigns. Most recently I have worked for several years 
on the Antarctic campaign, as First Mate and then 
Expedition Co-ordinator. Seeing Antarctica for the first 
time was a childhood dream come true and many visits 
since have not diminished the sense of awe and 
excitement that the Antarctic environment can engender.
This unique voyage to Shanghai will be the focal point 
for world wide public and political pressure to get China 
to halt all nuclear testing. After 25 years of 
campaigning on this issue we are moving closer to the 
goal of a nuclear arms free world and eventually a 
totally nuclear free world.  I am as committed to that 
vision now as I was 20 years ago when my ideals led me to 
Greenpeace were I became part of the largest and most 
effective environmental campaigning organisation in the 
world.

<B>Jeannette Haagsma, 34, 2nd mate.<BR>
Amsterdam, Nederlands</B>
 <P>
I studied psychology and became a drama teacher before 
getting my mates ticket in 1990. I have been involved in 
anti-nuclear demonstrations since high school and working 
at sea made me aware of how much pollution there is in 
the world -  even in the middle of the Atlantic 
you'll find rubbish! In 1991 I decided to use my 
professional skills to work with Greenpeace. I have 
sailed on the Moby Dick, the Sirius and mostly on the MV, 
involved in various campaigns and actions. I would like 
to see a peaceful, clean and above all 
nuclear free world and I am honoured to play a part in 
this campaign. I hope we reach China and that our 
presence makes a difference.

Philadelphia, USA</B>
 <P>
I have been a crew member on Greenpeace ships since 1991, atlhough my first 
involvement in a Greenpeace campaign was in 1983 as one of a team of people who 
entered the US Nevada nuclear test site and successfully delayed an explosion. I have 
also worked as a campaigner and a campaign co-ordinator on Greenpeace’s toxics 
campaign for six years before joining the ships.

<B>Bob James, 45, 2nd engineer/electrician.<BR>
Born Shrewsbury, Shropshire, now living in Sowerby<BR> 
Bridge, West Yorkshire, UK</B>
 <P>
I have worked for Greenpeace for approx six years, on the 
Sirius, and the Rainbow Warrior, but most of the time on 
the M/V Greenpeace, including  two Antarctic trips. 
Although cynical by nature I am committed to saving our 
environment as much as possible. I was on the M/V 
Greenpeace last year when it was subjected to an act of 
piracy in international waters by the French military, 
seized and illegally detained. I was also on the recovery 
crew six months later and am still on the crew for this 
voyage to China, where the object of the exercise is to 
convince China to stop nuclear tests of any description. 
This is an objective that I wholeheartedly support.

<B>Mark Hardingham, 37, 3rd engineer.<BR>
Fleetwood, Lancashire, UK.</B>
 <P>
I left school  aged 16 and went to work at British 
Nuclear Fuels Ltd on a four year apprenticeship as a 
maintenance fitter. I escaped to sea in May 1980 
(eight months after completing my apprenticeship) working 
for Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. and continued working on 
cargo ships until August 1985. I then traveled 
extensively, working here and there on yachts or 
building sites, in hotels and restaurants for 3 or 4 
months each year to finance my travels until Nov 1991, 
when I came to work with Greenpeace. I had been inspired 
by Greenpeace for many years before I finally wrote to 
Marine Services and I feel very privileged to be 
sailing the worlds oceans aboard Peace Ships. I enjoy 
nature, the wilderness, hiking, camping, cycling, 
climbing mountains exploring other countries and cultures 
- being in direct communication with life. I have been 
anti-nuclear since working at B.N.F.L. and seeing 
the inside of such dangerous and evil industry. Being 
part of the China voyage gives me another chance to 
express my grave concern about the nuclear nightmare.

<B>Neil Brewster, 32, radio operator<BR>
born Ararat, Victoria, Australia
 </B><P>
I did an Army apprenticeship in electronics, followed by 
six years service. I became a financial member of 
Greenpeace while I was still in the Army, and began 
voluntary work while on leave. Three months after being 
discharged from the Army I joined Greenpeace as a radio 
operator and have been working and volunteering for them 
ever since. I have also volunteered for other environment 
and peace organization, most notably the South East Asian 
Information Network, helping to set up communications 
equipment in Burma. I left the army because I realised 
there was more to do for our society than waste money on 
weapons. I think it is time to include China in the 
struggle to rid the earth of nukes.

 <P>
I served my national service with the Royal Air Force and 
on my demob  joined the murchant navy, sailing with the 
Union Castle Line out of London. Two years later I moved 
on to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanks and supply ships. 
On leaving the merchant navy in 1960 I worked ashore as a 
carpenter, and during that time I enlisted in the Royal 
Naval Auxiliary Service as a seaman. I offered to work 
for Greenpeace as a volunteer in 1992 and was offered the 
job as Bosun on the MV Solo. I have now been working on 
Greenpeace ships for the past four years

<B>Dominic Maher, 35, 2nd engineer.<BR>
Born Hastings, New Zealand.</B>
 <P>
I am a qualified engineer and I joined Greenpeace in 
1995 to utilise my skills in a more positive and 
constructive way.  This voyage to China is important to 
me because as soon as a unilateral CTBT is signed more 
effort can be made to concentrate on total nuclear
disarmament, ensuring a more secure and stable world for 
future generations. I have no children of my own but I 
have 12 neices and nephews and I believe it is up to all 
of us to make an effort on behalf of all children 
everywhere and to give them a safe  and nuclear free 
future.

<B>Bora Cvetkovic, 35, Deckhand/ship's doctor<BR>
born Vrsac,Yugoslavia<BR>
Now living in Amsterdam</B>
 <P>
From an early age I visited pure nature sites, so my 
admiration for a clean enviroment was developed during 
these years. While in secondary school I became a member 
of an enviromental group "Young Researchers".The main 
activities were recording and pointing to pollution that 
was caused by industrial complexes. After the outbreak of 
the war in my country in 1991 I moved to Amsterdam and a 
week later I applied to work for Greenpeace. It seemed 
attractive to continue working towards protecting our 
enviroment while at the same time practicing my 
profession - taking care of the health of my friends. 
While working with Greenpeace I can also enhance my 
knowledge of different cultures and enviroments.
I find this trip particularly important because a final 
step toward a ban on all nuclear tests seems to be closer 
than ever before. I am glad to participate in these 
efforts to realise the wishes of all peaceful people 
around the world and to at last stop the mistake 
that our civilization made fifty years ago.

I as brought up in mainly rural New Zealand, attended 14 
schools and in my working life have worked in shearing 
gangs, on a long-line fishing boat, in horticulture and 
as barmaid. In 1989 I got my Commercial Launchmasters' 
licence and in 1990 began working with Greenpeace as a 
deckhand on the Rainbow Warrior, Vega, Red Bill and the 
MV Greenpeace. I live in a very beautiful place and when 
I am not on the ships spend most of my time on the land 
gardening, tree planting and at the moment building an 
adobe in situ earth house. I work for Greenpeace because 
I appreciate the enviroment and see so much destruction 
going on around me. We are the guardians and as such are 
responsible for what is handed on to the future 
generations. This campaign is important to me  because I 
feel the nuclear weapons industry poses a very serious 
threat to the future of this planet. To have all 
countries make the first step towards a peaceful and 
safer world, can only be a positive move.

STATEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
29th July 1996:</H3>

 
 
<P><B>On 29 July, 1996, China successfully conducted a nuclear test.  </B>

<P>The Government  of the People's Republic of China hereby solemnly declares that it will start a
moratorium on nuclear weapons testing effective from 30 July 1996.  Such an
important decision by china is not only a response to their appeal of the vast
number of non-nuclear weapons states, but also a concrete action to promote
nuclear disarmament.
 
<P>Over the past three decades and more since its first nuclear test on 16 October
1964, china has established a capable and effective nuclear self-defense force.
In a pioneering spirit of self-reliance, sustaining hardships and personal
sacrifice, a large number of Chinese workers, scientific and technical

personnel, officers and soldiers of the Peoples Liberation Army, as well as all
the staff working on the front of national defence have made strenuous efforts
under extremely difficult conditions in the research, manufacture and
development of China's nuclear weapons.  Their indelible historic feats have
greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and enhanced China's
capability to safeguard peace.  The Chinese Government and people wish to
extend cordial greetings and pay high respect to them.
 
<P>Adhering to its independent foreign policy of peace, China has always stood for
the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
Historical circumstances compelled China to develop nuclear weapons.  For more
than a century, the Chinese nation experienced untold sufferings and scourges
of war inflicted upon by foreign aggressors.  After the founding of new China,
it was still subjected to the threat of war, including that of nuclear weapons.
In order to survive and develop, China was left with no other alternative.  Our
development of a limited nuclear capacity is not aimed at threatening other
people, but is solely for self defence with a view to maintaining independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ensuring a peaceful life of the
people.  Moreover, our development of nuclear weapons is to safeguard world
peace, counter nuclear blackmail and nuclear threat, prevent nuclear war and
ultimately destroy all nuclear weapons.
 
<P>Since the very first day when China came into possession of nuclear weapons,
China has solemnly declared that at no time and under no circumstances will it
be the first to use nuclear weapons.  China has also undertaken unconditionally
not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons
states or nuclear weapon-free zones.  China is the only nuclear state in the
world that has made and abided by such commitments.  China has never deployed
nuclear weapons outside its border, nor has it ever used or threatened to us
nuclear weapons against other countries.
 
<P>China is a peace loving country and an important force for the maintenance of
world peace and stability.  China is in favour of reaching a comprehensive ban
on nuclear weapon test explosions in the process towards the objective of
complete nuclear disarmament.  China has taken an active part in the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) negotiations in Geneva, and is striving
for the conclusion, within this year and on consensus basis, of a fair,
reasonable and verifiable CTBT with universal adherence and unlimited duration.
<P>China is ready to work with other members of the international community to
this end.
 
<P>Halting nuclear tests is an important step towards nuclear disarmament.  In
order to remove once and for all the threat of nuclear war hanging over mankind
and achieve lasting peace and universal security throughout the world, the
<P>Chinese Government hereby appeals to all the countries, nuclear weapon states
in particular, for the following:
 
<P>Major nuclear weapon states should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence.
States with huge nuclear arsenals should continue to drastically reduce their
nuclear stockpiles.
<P>All nuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear we
apons at any time and under any circumstances, commit themselves
unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear weapon sates or nuclear weapon-free zones, and conclude, at any
early date, international legal instruments to such effect.
<P>States with nuclear weapons deployed outside their boarders should withdraw all
these weapons home.  All nuclear weapon states should pledge their support to
the establishment of nuclear weapon-free zones, respect their status as such
and undertake corresponding obligations.
<P>No country should develop and deploy space weapon systems or missile defense
systems undermining strategic security and stability.
<P>An international convention on the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded through negotiations with
the participation of all states.
 
<P>To realize the goal of a nuclear weapon-free world and ensure the enjoyment of p
eace, security, stability and prosperity by all countries is the strong
aspiration of all people.  
<P>We sincerely hope that there should never be a
nuclear war.  We are convinced that with the concerted efforts of all
peace-loving countries and people around the world, nuclear war is preventable.
<P>If mankind can produce nuclear weapons in the 20th century, it can very well
destroy such weapons in the 21st century.  
<P>The Chinese Government and people
are ready to join the governments and people around the world for the
realization of this lofty goal.

               <BR>Fax 86 21 6255 2761
 

<P>From:       <BR> MV Greenpeace
        <BR>FAX:  872-130-0311
 
 

<P><B>Dear Mr. President,</B>
 
<P>We are writing to you on behalf of Greenpeace.  As you may know, Greenpeace is
an independent, popularly supported non-governmental organization that has
worked for 25 years to convince the nuclear weapons states to stop testing.  As
of this year, the United States, Russia, France and the United Kingdom have
stopped nuclear testing and the world is on the verge of achieving a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
 
<P>On the evening of June 8, the MV Greenpeace departed from Manila to continue
its voyage of peace to China.  We bear a message about the need to end nuclear
testing and agree to a genuine CTBT by the end of June.
 
<P>The June 8 nuclear weapons test at Lop Nor, and your country's announcement
that another test is planned by September,  have underscored the urgency of our
visit to Shanghai. These additional tests, aside from the environmental
contamination they will cause, could sabotage the CTBT talks underway in
Geneva.  China's continued testing is also impeding progress towards complete
global nuclear disarmament, of which a CTBT is the first step. 
 
<P>There are less than three weeks remaining to reach agreement on a CTBT if the
treaty is to be ready for signing this year.  There is an urgent need for China
to take steps to support a meaningful CTBT now, including cancelling further
tests and dropping all references to so-called peaceful nuclear explosions. 
 
<P>Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing has expressed reservations
about the MV Greenpeace's visit, we hope you, the Ministry, and other members
of government will appreciate its importance and welcome us to Shanghai.
Additionally, we hope that when we reach Chinese waters around June 12 the
reception will be cordial.  While in Shanghai, we look forward to meeting with
representatives of the People's Republic of China to discuss these serious
matters of nuclear disarmament and an immediate end to nuclear testing.
 
<P>On behalf of the millions of people around the world who want an end to nuclear
testing and a meaningful Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we look forward to
hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
 
<B><P>Respectfully,
<BR>Ulf Birgander, 
<BR>Master
Xavier Pastor, Campaigner</B>

<P><B>Gentlemen,</B>
 
<P>On the evening of June 8 the MV Greenpeace departed from Manila to continue its
voyage of peace to China.  We bear a message about the need to end nuclear
testing and agree to a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) by
the end of June.
 
<P>As you know, Greenpeace is an independent, popularly supported non-governmental
organization that has worked for 25 years to convince the nuclear weapons
states to stop testing.  As of  this year, the United States, Russia, France
and the United Kingdom have stopped nuclear testing and the world is on the
verge of achieving a CTBT.
 
<P>China's June 8 nuclear weapons test at Lop Nor, and your country's announcement
that another test is planned by September,  have underscored the urgency of our
visit to Shanghai. These additional tests, aside from the environmental
contamination they will cause, could sabotage the CTBT talks underway in
Geneva.  China's continued testing is also impeding progress towards complete
global nuclear disarmament, of which a CTBT is the first step. 
 
<P>There are less than three weeks remaining to reach agreement on a CTBT if the
treaty is to be ready for signing this year.  There is an urgent need for China
to take steps to support a meaningful CTBT now, including cancelling further
tests and dropping all references to peaceful nuclear explosions. 
 
<P>Although you have expressed reservations about the MV Greenpeace's visit, we
hope you and your government will appreciate its importance and welcome us to
Shanghai.  Additionally, we hope that when we reach Chinese waters around  June
12 the reception will be cordial and you will be able to facilitate our
arrival.  While in Shanghai, we look forward to meeting with you and other
officials to discuss these serious matters of nuclear disarmament and an
immediate end to nuclear testing.
 
<P>On behalf of the millions of people around the world who want an end to nuclear
testing and a meaningful Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we look forward to
hearing from you soon.
 
<B><P>Sincerely,
<BR>Ulf Birgander, Master
<BR>Xavier Pastor, Campaigner</B>

The new Italian Minister of the Enviroment, Senator Edo Ronchi, sent out a message to
the MV Greenpeace hereafter translated. He was the first
signataire of the first anti FNT motion passed by the Senate
on July 1995.<P><HR>
 <P>
Dear friends of Greenpeace,
 <P>
I wish you the best for the <m/v Greenpeace> voyage to
Shangai, whose purpose is to ask China to sign, with the other
Nuclear States, the CTBT, the text of which is under
discussion in Geneva.
 <P>
There has never been a better moment for the conclusion of a
Treaty which ends one of the saddest pages of this century,
the nuclear test era. Your mission and the request to meet
Chinese Authorities are peaceful acts representing all those
who wish for an end to nuclear tests.
 <P>
I wish you a most successful journey
 <P>
<I>MoE Edo Ronchi</I>

<H3>Selected Accidents Involving Nuclear Weapons 1950-1993</H3>

<B>Greenpeace March 1996</B>
<P>
The twenty-three accidents listed below involving U.S., Soviet,
and Russian nuclear weapons or nuclear-armed ships and submarines
are some of the more serious nuclear accidents to befall U.S. and
Soviet nuclear forces.
<P>
As a result of accidents, some 51 nuclear warheads were lost into
sea (44 Soviet and 7 U.S.  However, at least one Soviet warhead
was recovered).  Also, seven nuclear reactors (5 Soviet and 2
U.S.) from three Soviet and two U.S. nuclear-powered submarines
have been lost at sea due to accidents.  Another 19 nuclear
reactors from nuclear-powered vessels have been deliberately
dumped at sea (18 Soviet and 1 U.S.).
<P>
The U.S. Navy is known to have experienced at least 380 nuclear
weapons incidents, but the details are not known.  It assumed
that other countries with nuclear weapons have had similar
nuclear weapons accidents or incidents, but official secrecy
means that no information is available.
<P>
The nuclear nations' operational arsenals contain over 21,000
nuclear weapons.  Their militaries still retain hundreds of
nuclear-armed launchers and nuclear-capable military units.  The
threat of a serious nuclear weapons accident has not disappeared
with the end of the Cold War.  This is particularly the case
where the arms race remains the most active:  at sea where
nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines
still go on regular patrols at levels that have not changed much
if at all from the height of the Cold War.
<P>
If history is a guide, nuclear weapons safety probably has been a
problem for the non-declared nuclear powers like India and Israel
and for other countries that have had or do have incipient
nuclear weapons programs.  The experience of the U.S. and the
Soviet Union suggests not only are nuclear arsenals
extraordinarily expensive but they also come with serious safety,
health, and environmental costs.
<P>

<HR>
<P>
1. <B>11 APRIL 1950</B>:  Shortly after departing Kirtland Air Force
Base (AFB) in New Mexico, a U.S. B-29 bomber carrying a nuclear
bomb crashed into a mountain.  The bomb was destroyed but its
nuclear capsule with the fissile materials, which was also on
board the aircraft, had not been inserted for safety reasons.
<P>
2. <B>10 MARCH 1956</B>:  A U.S. Air Force B-47 bomber carrying two
capsules of nuclear materials for nuclear bombs, en route from
MacDill AFB, Florida, to Europe, failed to meet its aerial
refueling plane over the Mediterranean Sea.  An extensive search
failed to locate any traces of the missing aircraft or crew.
<P>
3.  <B>27 JULY 1956</B>:  During a routine deployment to England, a U.S.
B-47 bomber skidded and slid off a runway at Lakenheath Royal Air
Force (RAF) Base.  The plane burst into flames and crashed into a
nuclear bomb storage igloo in which there were three Mark 6
nuclear bombs.  The bombs did not explode.
<P>
4. <B> 18 AUGUST 1959</B>:  A helicopter engine exploded on board the
U.S. aircraft carrier USS Wasp (CVS-18) which was operating 250
miles off Norfolk, Virginia.  As fires raged, the ship's crew
prepared to flood the nuclear weapons magazine, but after more
than two hours the fires were brought under control.
<P>
5.  <B>4 JUNE 1962</B>:  A nuclear test device atop a U.S. Thor rocket
booster fell into the Pacific Ocean near Johnston Island after
the rocket had to be destroyed.  The test was part of the U.S.'s
first high altitude atmospheric nuclear test attempt.
<P>
6.  <B>20 JUNE 1962</B>:  A second attempt to detonate a nuclear device
in the atmosphere failed when a Thor booster was destroyed over
Johnston Island.  The nuclear device fell into the Pacific Ocean.
<P>
7.  <B>5 DECEMBER 1965</B>:  While the U.S. aircraft carrier USS
Ticonderoga (CVA-14) steamed en route from bombing operations off
Vietnam to the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, Japan, an A-4E attack
jet loaded with a B-43 thermonuclear bomb rolled off the Number 2
elevator, and sank in 16,000 feet of water.  The aircraft carrier
was positioned about 70 miles from the Ryuku Islands and about
200 miles east of Okinawa.  The bomb, aircraft and pilot were not
recovered.
<P>
8.  <B>17 JANUARY 1966</B>:  A collision occurred between a U.S. B-52
nuclear bomber and a KC-135 tanker aircraft while over the
village of Palomares in southern Spain.  The B-52 was on an
airborne alert operation and carried four B-28 thermonuclear
bombs.  In the collision, the KC-135 exploded and caused the B-52
to break up, scattering wreckage over a 100 square mile area. 
One of the four nuclear bombs landed relatively intact, while the
high explosives in two other bombs detonated upon impact with the
ground scattering radioactive materials over the village and
surrounding area.  The fourth bomb fell into the sea and was
recovered intact three months later after an extensive underwater
search.
<P>
9. <B> 21 JANUARY 1968</B>:  A U.S. B-52G nuclear bomber crashed on the
ice seven miles west of Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. 
The aircraft was on a airborne alert flight and carried four B-28
thermonuclear bombs.  Upon impact with the ice the bomber
exploded and all four nuclear bombs were destroyed, scattering
radioactive materials over a large area.
<P>
10.  <B>8-10 MARCH 1968</B>:  The K-219, a Soviet Golf II class (Project
629M) diesel-powered ballistic missile submarine armed with three
nuclear SS-N-5 missiles, sank in the Pacific, about 750 miles
northwest of the Island of Oahu, Hawaii.  The submarine possibly
also carried two nuclear torpedoes.
<P>
11.  <B>27 MAY 1968</B>:  The U.S. nuclear-powered submarine USS
Scorpion (SSN-589) sank about 400 miles southwest of the Azores,
killing all 99 men on board.  The submarine was powered by one
nuclear reactor and carried two nuclear-armed ASTOR torpedoes.
<P>
12.  <B>12 APRIL 1970</B>:  The K-8, a Soviet November class (Project
627A) nuclear-powered attack submarine, sank in the Atlantic
Ocean 300 miles northwest of Spain.  The submarine was powered by
two nuclear reactors and carried two nuclear torpedoes.
<P>
13. <B> 29 NOVEMBER 1970</B>:  A fire broke out in the stern of the U.S.
Navy submarine tender USS Canopus (AS-34) while it was at the
Holy Loch submarine base in Scotland.  The tender carried several
nuclear-armed missiles and two U.S. nuclear-powered ballistic
missile submarines were moored alongside.  It took four hours to
bring the fire under control and three men were killed.
<P>
14.  <B>22 NOVEMBER 1975</B>:  The U.S. aircraft carrier USS John F.
Kennedy (CV-67) collided with the cruiser USS Belknap (CG-26) in
rough seas at night during air exercises in the Mediterranean Sea
off Sicily.  The collision caused major fires and explosions, and
the commander of Carrier Striking Force for the Sixth Fleet
issued a "Broken Arrow" message -- at top secret communication
about a nuclear weapons accident -- warning of a "high
probability that nuclear weapons on the USS Belknap were involved
in fire and explosions."  Eventually, the nuclear weapons barely
escaped destruction as the fire was contained just feet from the
forward weapons magazine.
<P>
15.  <B>16 APRIL 1976</B>:  The cruiser USS Albany (CG-10) experienced a
nuclear weapons incident -- known as a "Dull Sword" -- when a
TALOS anti-air missile's nuclear warhead was damaged.
<P>
16. <B>8 SEPTEMBER 1977</B>:  The K-171, a Soviet Delta I (Project 667B)
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, accidently
jettisoned a nuclear warhead near Kamchatka in the Pacific Ocean
after a build-up of pressure in a missile launch tube.  After a
search, the warhead was recovered.
<P>
17.  <B>18-19 SEPTEMBER 1980</B>:  A fire and explosion in a U.S. Titan
II missile silo near Little Rock, Arkansas, blew off the silo
door and catapulted the missile's 9 megaton yield warhead into
the air.  It landed over a 1,000 feet from the silo, but it was
only slightly damaged.
<P>
18. <B>9 APRIL 1981</B>:  The U.S. nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarine USS George Washington (SSBN-598) collided with a
Japanese freighter in the East China Sea.  The freighter sank and
the submarine suffered slight damage to its sail.  The submarine
probably carried a total of 160 nuclear warheads on its 16
Poseidon C3 missiles.
<P>
19. <B> 21 MARCH 1984</B>:  The U.S. aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk
(CV-63) collided with a Soviet nuclear-powered Victor class
(Project 671) attack submarine in the Sea of Japan.  At the time
of the collision, the USS Kitty Hawk is estimated to have carried
several dozen nuclear weapons, and the submarine probably carried
two nuclear torpedoes.
<P>
20. <B> 6 OCTOBER 1986</B>:  The K-219, a Soviet Yankee class (Project
667A) nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine armed with 16
SS-N-6 missiles (two warheads each) and probably also two nuclear
torpedoes, sank 600 miles northeast of Bermuda.  It was powered
by two nuclear reactors and 34 nuclear warheads were estimated to
be on board.
<P>
21. <B> 7 APRIL 1989</B>:  The K-278 Komsomolets, the Soviet Mike class
(Project 685) nuclear-powered attack submarine, sank off northern
Norway following on board fires and explosions.  The submarine
was powered by one nuclear reactor and carried two nuclear
torpedoes.
<P>
22.  <B>27 SEPTEMBER 1991</B>:  A missile misfired aboard a Soviet
Typhoon class (Project 941) nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarine in the White Sea during a training exercise. 
Fortunately, the submarine was able to return to base, but the
accident could have sunk the submarine, along with its two
nuclear reactors and nuclear-armed missiles and torpedoes.
<P>
23.  <B>20 MARCH 1993</B>:  A Russian Delta III class (Project 667BDR)
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine is struck by the U.S.
nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Grayling (SSN-646) while
operating in the Barents Sea close to the Kola Peninsula.  The
submarine suffered slight damage and was able to return to base,
but the collision could have sunk the Delta submarine including
its 16 SS-N-18 nuclear armed missiles.

<H3>Stop Nuclear Testing -- CTBT Now</H3>
 
Greenpeace
April 1996
 
<H3>Nuclear Testing</H3>
 
Since the first nuclear test at Alamagordo, New Mexico, in July
1945, the five major nuclear weapons states -- the U.S., Russia,
the U.K., France, and China -- plus India have conducted 2,044
nuclear tests:  on average one every nine days for the past 50
years.  Every test has produced environmental contamination,
helped to develop new weapons, and added to the arsenals of the
nuclear states.  Even with the end of the Cold War, nuclear
testing continues, a reminder that the nuclear arms race is not
over.
 
<H4>A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)</H4>
 
Since the 1950s, opposition to nuclear testing has been spurred
by concerns over its health and environmental effects and by
testing being one of the more visible signs of the nuclear arms
race.  Most recently, in 1995-1996, massive worldwide criticism
of French nuclear tests in the South Pacific, caused France to
curtail its test program.  Public opposition and the dangers of
an arms race fueled by nuclear testing have lead governments to
try to limit and stop nuclear testing for over 40 years. 
Finally, following the adoption of a unanimous resolution at the
United Nations General Assembly in 1993, the Conference on
Disarmament began negotiations on a CTBT to end nuclear testing
for all time.  These historic negotiations have gathered
widespread support.  In 1995, the 170 nations participating in
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review and Extension
Conference in New York in May, said a CTBT should be completed no
later than 1996.  This was reaffirmed by a United Nations
resolution in November 1995.
 <P>
In mid-May, when the negotiations for a CTBT reopen at the United
Nations Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva, the 37
countries in the CD will have just seven weeks to complete their
work if a treaty is to be ready for signing in September at the
outset of the United Nations General Assembly's 51st session.  If
the CD delegates cannot agree the text of the treaty by the end
of June, the chance to have a CTBT will have slipped away again,
perhaps forever.
 <P>
One of the key points of disagreement remaining is the CTBT's
scope, i.e. what will banned by the treaty.  At the Moscow
Nuclear Safety Summit, Russia at last joined France, the U.S.,
and the U.K. in agreeing that the CTBT should ban all nuclear
explosions regardless of their size and regardless of whether
they explosions are said to be for military or peaceful purposes
(the so-called '0-yield CTBT').  Of the five 'official' nuclear
powers, only China has not agreed to a 0-yield CTBT, wanting to
preserve the option to conduct 'Peaceful Nuclear Explosions' for
civilian purposes.
<P> 
Another important political problem to be resolved is the
Preamble of the Treaty.  The U.S. and other nuclear powers are
opposed to including language in the Preamble that refers to the
need for further specific steps towards nuclear disarmament
steps.  There are also several technical and political issues
regarding verification and the treaty's entry into force which
also need to be settled urgently.
<P> 
Several external events also may derail the CTBT talks.  First,
and most importantly, China still plans to conduct nuclear
weapons tests and has said that it halt testing only when the
treaty enters into force -- at least several years away.  Testing
during the talks or until the treaty enters into force may delay
the negotiations or the application of the treaty.
 <P>
Second, the U.S. has plans to conduct so-called sub-critical
nuclear tests in June and September and continue this programme
in 1997 (and beyond).  Although these tests should not involve a
nuclear explosion and so would not be banned by a 0-yield CTBT,
they will use fissile materials and be conducted underground. 
The sophistication of these sub-critical tests may mean they
could be used to develop new nuclear weapons or improve or
perfect existing ones, thus calling into doubt one of U.S.
President Clinton's stated goals for the CTBT -- in January 1996,
he told the U.S. Congress that the CTBT "must end the race to
create new nuclear weapons."
<P> 
Finally, there are fears that tensions in South Asia may lead
India to conduct another nuclear test and so delay completion of
the treaty.
 
<H4>The CTBT and Beyond</H4>
 
A CTBT is a crucial step toward achieving nuclear disarmament and
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
<P> 
A CTBT will make it much harder for the nuclear weapons powers
and the handful of non-nuclear weapons states with nuclear
ambitions to develop new nuclear weapons.  Getting a CTBT in
place will clear the way for additional disarmament measures.  By
prohibiting all nuclear explosions, a CTBT also would reduce the
risks to health and the environment.
 <P>
The CTBT, however, is just a first step toward nuclear
disarmament.  There are 21,000 nuclear weapons in the world today
-- 95 percent in the hands of the U.S. and Russia.  It is obvious
that once a CTBT is signed, several more nuclear disarmament
steps must follow in order to fulfill the promise to halt the
nuclear arms race and eliminate nuclear weapons.
<P> 
First, to strengthen the CTBT and make it irrevocable, the rest
of nuclear weapons states should follow the example of France and
close their nuclear weapons test sites.  The nuclear weapons
states should also forgo underground sub-critical tests.  Their
ambiguous purpose undermines the goals of the CTBT and they will
complicate the verification of a CTBT.  Also, they should declare
as a matter of policy no new nuclear weapons will be designed or
built.
 <P>
Second, the U.S. and Russia must move immediately to negotiate
deeper reductions in their massive nuclear arsenals, and to
withdraw any remaining nuclear weapons from overseas.  Production
of new nuclear weapons systems, like strategic nuclear submarines
and new nuclear missiles should be stopped.  The U.S. and Russian
nuclear weapons deployed in Europe and western Russia and weapons
carried at sea should be withdrawn and eliminated:  Europe should
join the growing list of Nuclear Weapons Free Zones around the
world and the world's oceans should be made nuclear free.
<P> 
Third, the other nuclear weapons states, the U.K., France, and
China need to join discussions on reducing and eliminating their
nuclear weapons. Israeli nuclear weapons need to be addressed in
the context of the Middle East peace process.
 <P>
Finally, the production of fissile materials needs to stop and
international control needs to be established over fissile
materials and dismantled weapons to ensure the disarmament
process is irreversible.

Greenpeace
April 1996
 
<A NAME="us"><H4>UNITED STATES</H4></A>
 
Origin of nuclear weapons program:  The U.S. started studying the
possibility of building nuclear weapons in 1939-1940.  In 1942,
the official decision was taken to proceed with building a bomb
and the Manhattan Project was established.
 <P>
First Nuclear Test:  16 July 1945, Alamogordo, New Mexico.
 <P>

the Pacific:  Johnston Atoll; Eniwetok Atoll; Bikini Atoll;
Christmas Island.  There have also been three nuclear tests in
the South Atlantic Ocean and four in the Pacific Ocean.
 
 
<A NAME="ussr"><H4>USSR</H4></A>
 
Origin of nuclear weapons program:  During the 1930s, the Soviet
Union had research programs on atomic and nuclear physics.  In
1943, a pilot project was established to pursue the development
of nuclear weapons.

across the USSR, outside the formal test sites, as part of a
program of 'Peaceful Nuclear Explosions'.
 
<A NAME="fr"><H4>FRANCE</H4></A>
 
Origin of nuclear weapons program:  Although French physicists
were leaders in the field of 20th century nuclear physics it was
not until 1951 that the military started showing an interest in
nuclear weapons.  Toward the end of 1954, France officially
decided to build a nuclear bomb.

declared it will close its South Pacific test site).
 
<A NAME="uk"><H4>UNITED KINGDOM</H4></A>
 
Origin of nuclear weapons program:  The U.K. started looking into
nuclear weapons in late 1940-early 1941.  Unable to develop a
weapon by themselves, the British passed their data to the U.S.
and then assisted in the U.S. Manhattan Project from 1943 till

Past nuclear test site:  same as above.
 
 
<A NAME="india"><H4>INDIA</H4></A>
 
Origin of nuclear weapons program:  India's Atomic Energy
Commission was established in 1954.  The existing nuclear program
began to include a nuclear explosives program after China tested
their first nuclear weapon in 1964.  In 1970, officials started
stating publicly that India was looking into the possibility of
using nuclear weapons for peaceful purposes.
 <P>
First nuclear test:  18 May 1974, near village of Pokharan,
Rajasthan Desert.

<H3>History of Nuclear Weapons Testing</H3>
 
Greenpeace
April 1996
 <P>
The nuclear weapons age began on 16 July 1945 when the U.S.
exploded the first nuclear bomb, codenamed 'Trinity' at
Alamogordo, New Mexico.  The Soviet Union was the next country to
explode a bomb, with a test on 29 August 1949.  Other countries
followed:  Britain's first test was on 3 October 1952; France's
on 3 December 1960; China's on 16 October 1964 and; India's on 18
May 1974.
<P>
The "thermonuclear age" began on 1 November 1952 when the U.S.
exploded the first thermonuclear bomb at Eniwetok atoll in the
Pacific.  Codenamed 'Mike', this bomb was 500 times more powerful
than the 'Trinity' test and had an estimated yield of 10.4
megatons.  As for the other thermonuclear states:  the Soviet
Union tested its first thermonuclear bomb on 22 November 1955;
China on 17 June 1967; Britain on 8 November 1957 and; France on
24 August 1968.
<P> 
The U.S. has carried out 1,030 nuclear weapons tests (the last
and final test on 23 September 1993).  The Soviet Union:  715
tests (the last on 25 October 1990 -- Russia has not exploded any
nuclear weapons).  France:  210 tests (the last and final test on
27 January 1996).  Britain:  45 tests (the last and final on 26
November 1991).  China:  43 tests (with some four more tests
reportedly planned for 1996-1997).
 <P>
The average pace of nuclear weapons testing is remarkable:  Since
16 July 1945 there have been 2,044 tests worldwide, the
equivalent of one test occurring somewhere in the world every
nine days for the last fifty years.
<P> 
The U.S. has conducted the equivalent of one nuclear weapons test
every 17 days since its first test; the Soviet Union has tested
on average every 23 days; France every 63 days; Britain every 349
days and; China every 222 days.  India has conducted only one
test so far. 
<P> 
Nuclear weapon test explosions have been carried out in all
environments:  above ground, underground, and underwater.  They
have occurred on top of towers, onboard barges, suspended from
balloons, on the earth's surface, underwater to depths of 2,000
feet, underground to depths of more than 8,000 feet, and in
horizontal tunnels. Test bombs also have been dropped by aircraft
and fired by rockets up to 200 miles into the atmosphere.
<P> 
Nuclear weapons tests have been carried out all over the world. 
In the Pacific at:  Bikini Atoll (U.S.); Christmas Island
(U.S./U.K.); Eniwetok Atoll (U.S.); Fangataufa Atoll (Fr);
Johnston Atoll (U.S.); Malden Island (U.K.) and; Mororua Atoll
(Fr).  Also, in Australia, Monte Bello Island, at Emu Fields, and
Maralinga (U.K. tests).
 <P>
In the U.S.:  Nevada (several sites; but the Nevada Test Site is
the only currently open U.S. test site); Alamogordo, New Mexico;
Carlsbad, New Mexico; Hattiesberg, Mississippi; Grand Valley,
Colorado; Rifle, Colorado; Farmington, New Mexico; Hot Creek
Valley, Central Nevada; Fallon, Nevada and; Amchitka, Alaska.
 <P>
In the Soviet Union:  the Arctic Islands of Novaya Zemlya (the
only currently open Russian test site); Semipalatinsk in eastern
Kazakhstan; near Azgir and Astrakhan in western Kazakhstan; near
Orenburg between the Volga river and the Ural mountains; in the
Ukraine; in Uzbekistan, and in Turkmenistan.
 <P>
In Algeria:  near Reggane, and in the Hoggar Massif at In Ecker
(French tests).  In China:  at the Lop Nor Test Site in Xingjiang
Province (the currently open Chinese test site).  In India:  at
the Pokhran test site.  Also, in the South Atlantic, (U.S.;
rocket launched tests).
 <P>
Of the 2,044 nuclear weapons tests worldwide, there have been 711
in the atmosphere or underwater:  215 by the U.S., 207 by the
Soviet Union, 21 by Britain, 45 by France and, 23 by China.
<P> 
The last atmospheric nuclear weapons test occurred on 16 October
1980 in China.  The first was on 16 July 1945 in the U.S.
 <P>
It is estimated that the total yield of all the atmospheric
nuclear weapons tests conducted is 438 megatons.  That's
equivalent to 29,200 Hiroshima size bombs.  In the 36 years
between 1945 and 1980 when atmospheric testing was being
conducted this would have been equivalent to exploding a
Hiroshima size bomb in the atmosphere every 11 hours.
<P> 
Approximately 3,830 kilograms of plutonium has been left in the
ground as a result of all underground nuclear testing and some
4,200 kilograms of plutonium has been discharged into the
atmosphere as a result of atmospheric nuclear testing.
 <P>
There has also been a program of 'Peaceful Nuclear Explosions'
conducted over the years by two of the five declared nuclear
powers.  The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive PNE
program.  Some 116 PNE's were conducted between 1965 and 1988: 
81 in Russia, 30 in Kazakhstan, two in the Ukraine, two in
Uzbekistan and one in Turkmenistan.  These PNEs had a variety of
uses:  deep seismic sounding; creating underground storage
cavities; helping to help extract gas and oil; extinguishing
burning gas or oil wells; creating reservoirs and; one was used
to help build a canal.
 <P>
The U.S. carried out 27 PNE's between 1961 and 1973:  one in
Carlsbad, Colorado, one in Grand Valley, Colorado, one in Rifle,
Colorado, one in Farmington, New Mexico, and 23 at the National
Test Site in Nevada.  France, Britain, and China have not
conducted PNE's; China, however, remains interested in conducting
PNEs in the future.  India claims its only nuclear test was for
peaceful purposes.
 <P>
Wherever nuclear weapons testing has occurred for whatever
reasons there have been environmental problems.  Radioactivity
has leaked into the environment from underground nuclear tests,
large areas of land are uninhabitable as a result of atmospheric
and underground nuclear testing, and indigenous people, their
children and their children's children's health and livelihoods
have been affected by nuclear weapons tests.
 <P>
Greenpeace has made the achievement of a CTBT in 1996 a major
priority.  The time for the CTBT is now, and a CTBT is needed as
a critical first step toward nuclear disarmament.

<H3>World Nuclear Arsenals 1996</H3>
 
Greenpeace
April 1996
 <P>
At the beginning of 1996, there were some 21,000 operational
nuclear weapons in the world.  Divided among six countries,
nearly 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons are in the
possession of the U.S. and Russia.
 <P>
Half a decade after the ending of the Cold War, none of the
nuclear powers display any willingness to give up their nuclear
arsenals.  Instead, all are consolidating their nuclear forces at
lower levels, adjusting their nuclear strategies to new post-Cold
War missions, and all continue to modernize their nuclear forces.
 <P>
Sea-based nuclear forces are attaining a new prominence in the
post-Cold War era.  While all U.S. and Russian land-based
missiles (ICBMs) will be limited to carrying one nuclear warhead
under the START II Treaty, strategic submarines will continue to
carry offensive submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs)
with multiple warheads.  The sea is the only place where
strategic nuclear operations continue largely as they did during
the Cold War.  The U.S. and Russia both plan to put about half of
their future deployable strategic nuclear warheads at sea; France
nearly 90 percent; while Britain will have its entire nuclear
arsenal on submarines.
<P>
Since the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) was signed in
1987 and the Bush-Gorbachev proposals of 1991, there have been no
new arms control agreements or initiatives to constrain or
prohibit non-strategic nuclear forces although they represent
almost a quarter of the world's nuclear stockpile and proliferant
states are more likely first to develop tactical rather than
strategic nuclear weapons.
 
<A NAME="us"><H4>The United States</H4></A>
 
The U.S. has some 9,150 nuclear weapons in its operational
arsenal.  This includes approximately 8,000 strategic warheads of
nine different types (deployed on nuclear-powered ballistic
missile submarines, ICBMs, and bombers), and 1,150 non-strategic
warheads of five types.  Another 1,100 strategic and non-
strategic nuclear warheads are thought to be held in reserve.
 <P>
The U.S. continues to modernize its nuclear arsenal, albeit at
much lower rate than during the Cold War.  New Trident nuclear-
powered ballistic missile submarines and B-2 long-range bombers
continue to enter service, and major upgrades are underway on
both the Trident SLBMs and land-based Minuteman ICBMs.  Moreover,
the U.S. plans to "reproduce" hundreds of nuclear warheads to
replace aging or "unsafe" warheads in the stockpile.  This
includes a new version of the B-61 air-dropped nuclear bomb to
replace the older B-53 bomb in the year 2000 for the purpose of
being able to destroy underground facilities.
 <P>
Under START II, it is widely perceived that the number of U.S.
nuclear weapons will be reduced to 3,500 warheads by 2003.  But
the reality is different:  the Clinton administration plans to
retain a nuclear arsenal more than twice that size.  START II
does not require nuclear warheads to be destroyed, so the Clinton
administration will keep another 2,500 intact warheads in reserve
as a "hedge" which can be "uploaded" onto operational platforms
(e.g. submarine missiles and bombers) to quickly "reconstitute"
the force level back to the START I treaty size if this is deemed
necessary.  Moreover, the START II treaty will only affect
deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but the U.S. will also keep
950 warheads for non-strategic forces (these will be a
combination of air-dropped bombs and submarine fired sea-launched
cruise missiles (SLCMs)).
 
<A NAME="russia"><H4>Russia (CIS)</H4></A>
 
Russia's nuclear arsenal consists of more than 10,400 nuclear
warheads, of which 7,235 are strategic (deployed on nuclear-
powered ballistic missile submarines, ICBMs, and bombers), and
approximately 3,200 are non-strategic warheads.  Another 7,000 -
13,000 nuclear warheads are thought to be in reserve or awaiting
dismantlement.
 <P>
Russia continues to try to upgrade the SS-N-20 SLBM on board the
six Typhoon class (Project 941) nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines with a new SLBM, the SS-N-26.  A new nuclear-powered
ballistic missile submarine has been designed, and the Russian
Navy is hoping to receive financing to proceed with its
construction.  Also, SS-25 (Topol) ICBMs continue to be produced
and deployed; plans call for several hundred more to enter
service by 2003.
 <P>
In addition to the 3,500 operational warheads permitted under
START II, like with the U.S.'s arsenal, the actual size of
Russia's future nuclear stockpile will be much larger.  Russia
may keep approximately an additional 3,000 non-strategic nuclear
warheads which are not counted under START II.  Russia also may
chose to retain a reserve of thousands of additional warheads.
 
<A NAME="fr"><H4>France</H4></A>
 
As the largest of the "smaller" nuclear powers, France has an
arsenal of nearly 500 operational nuclear warheads deployed on
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, on land-based
aircraft, and with aircraft on board an aircraft carrier.
<P> 
French President Jacques Chirac announced in February 1996 that
France will scrap its land-based nuclear missile force, thus
making France the second nuclear power after the U.K. to abandon
a "triad" of nuclear forces.  This plan will eliminate the 18
operational SSBS S3D missiles deployed in southern France as well
as 30 Hades missiles and their associated TN90 warheads held in
storage.
 <P>
Yet at the same time, President Chirac disclosed plans to
modernize France's sea- and air-based nuclear forces.  This
includes deployment in 2010-2015 of a new SLBM, designated the
M51, on board four new Triomphant class nuclear-powered ballistic
missile submarines, scheduled to enter service between 1996 and
2005.  A new nuclear air-launched missile, designated the ASMP+,
will also be built for entry into service around 2007.  It is
thought that the six nuclear tests conducted by France in the
South Pacific between September 1995 and January 1996 were partly
used to complete the development of the new warheads for the M51
and ASMP+ missiles.
 
<A NAME="china"><H4>China</H4></A>
 
China has almost 450 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.  The weapons
are deployed in on triad of nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines, ICBMs, and bombers.  The arsenal also includes about
150 nuclear weapons for non-strategic use, including nuclear
artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions.
 <P>
Unlike the other nuclear powers, China has not announced any
reductions in its nuclear stockpile as a result of the end of the
Cold War.
 <P>
Modernization of Chinese nuclear forces includes development of
two new ICBMs (the DF-31 and DF-41) which are expected to be
deployed in the late 1990s and around 2010, respectively.  The
DF-41 will be China's first missile with multiple warheads.  A
new SLBM, the JL-2 (CSS-N-4), is also under development for
deployment in the late 1990s.  It has a range of nearly five
times that of China's current SLBM.
 
<A NAME="uk"><H4>United Kingdom</H4></A>
 
The U.K. nuclear arsenal consists of approximately 392 nuclear
warheads, deployed on nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines and with Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter-bombers.
<P>
The U.K. government has decided to phase out all air-delivered
nuclear bombs by 1998.  After that, the entire operational
nuclear stockpile will be deployed on board a fleet of four new
nuclear-powered Vanguard class ballistic missile submarines
carrying U.S.-made Trident SLBMs.  The second of the class, the
HMS Victorious, recently entered service.  This arrangement will
slightly reduce the U.K. nuclear arsenal to a maximum of 384
nuclear warheads.
 <P>
In addition to a strategic role with multiple warheads, Trident
SLBMs on board U.K. ballistic missile submarines will also have a
tactical mission, replacing or augmenting that of the RAF bombs
being phased out.  According to press accounts, the HMS
Victorious deployed in January 1996 with a mix of single-warhead
"sub-strategic" and multiple-warhead strategic Trident missiles.
 
<A NAME="other"><H4>Other Nuclear Powers</H4></A>
In addition to the five declared nuclear powers, Israel has
developed nuclear weapons, and is thought to have an operational
stockpile of some 200 warheads.  India, which conducted a nuclear
test in 1974, may also have developed a limited nuclear arsenal. 
Pakistan may also to be capable of building nuclear weapons, but
it is unclear if it has done so.

<H3>China's Nuclear Weapons and Testing Program</H3>
 
Greenpeace
April 1996
 <P>
China has used its 43 nuclear tests since 1964 to develop the
world's fourth largest nuclear weapons arsenal (only the UK's is
smaller).  It includes approximately 450 nuclear weapons of at
least five different types, made up of around 300 strategic
weapons that could be fired from land, air and from submarines
and around 150 tactical weapons made up of artillery shells and
atomic demolition munitions. Together they have a cumulative
yield of over 251 megatons or some 17,000 Hiroshima bombs.
<P> 
China conducted two nuclear tests in 1995, one on 15 May and the
other on 17 August. Although many observers expected a further
two tests last autumn, China declined to carry out any further
tests while the world-wide condemnation of France's nuclear
testing program was at its height.

<H4>CURRENT POLICY ON COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY (CTBT)</H4>
 
China has said it will abide by a nuclear test ban but probably
only when it enters in force (some time after the actual
signing). When the current round of negotiations on a CTBT
commenced in Geneva on 23 January, China presented a major
obstacle to an agreement on a test ban by continuing to insist on
the right to conduct so called Peaceful Nuclear Explosions
(PNEs). Such explosions could be used to collect data for nuclear
weapons development, would be impossible to verify, and would
cause widespread environmental destruction. France, the U.S., the
U.K., and Russia are proposing a ban on all nuclear tests, the
so-called "zero yield" test ban.
 <P>
Furthermore, it is thought China has plans to carry out between
four and six more nuclear tests before implementing a test ban.
 <P>
These tests are central to the development of new nuclear weapons
systems. Last year's test on 15 May was three days after the end
of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review and
Extension Conference, where along with other nuclear weapons
states China committed itself to work towards nuclear
disarmament.
 
<H4>CHINA'S TESTING PROGRAM</H4>
 
Testing takes place at the Lop Nor site, approximately 265
kilometers south-east of Urumqi in the Xinjian region (due west
of Beijing, due north of Kathmandu). The Xinjian region is home
to the Uighur people, and China has never allowed any form of
independent or outside assessment of the environmental or health
impacts of its nuclear testing program. Since testing began in
1964, China has conducted one test on average every 284 days.
 <P>
China's current testing program is thought to involve warheads
for two new missile systems, one for deployment in the late
1990s, and one around 2010. The latter may carry several
warheads.  China is also developing a new  sea-launched ballistic
missile (JL-2) for deployment on its second generation strategic
nuclear-powered submarine. In May 1995, China tested a new
ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers.
<P> 
The chief design laboratory for Chinese nuclear weapons is the
Ninth Academy at Mianyang (Sichuan) or the Chinese Academy of
Engineering Physics (CAEP). Plutonium production for weapons
purposes, which has taken place at two reactors, in Jiuquan
(Gansu) and Guangyuan (Sichuan), reportedly ceased in 1991.
However a new plutonium facility is scheduled to open in the
mid-1990s.
 
<H4>RADIOACTIVITY AND LOP NOR</H4>
 
A 1991 book, "Radioactive Heaven and Earth," released by
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War
(IPPNW) has given the following amounts of radioactivity as
having been released from Lop Nor.
<P> 
The total amount of plutonium-239 released to the atmosphere as a
result of the 23 atmospheric nuclear tests is estimated at 3,300
curies, approximately 48 kilograms in weight. One millionth of a
gram of plutonium-239, if inhaled can cause cancer. The amount of
plutonium-239 still contained within the Lop Nor site as a result
of underground nuclear testing is estimated by IPPNW as 1,800
curies (25 kilograms).
<P> 
A further two million curies of caesium-137 and 1.3 million
curies of strontium-90 have also been released into the
atmosphere. The radioactive half-life of these materials are 30
and 29 years respectively. Caesium-137 concentrates in muscle
tissue, but normally passes out of the body in two years.
Strontium-90, however, attaches to the bones and thus stays in
the body giving radiation doses over a longer period of time. 
The above figures are exclusive of the shorter lived fission
products, such as iodine-131, which has a radioactive half-life
of eight days, which would have also been released.
 
<H4>CHINESE NUCLEAR TESTS: 1964-1995</H4>
 
The Chinese nuclear test site is at Lop Nor in the western
province of Xin Jiang.  Since the first test there on 16 October
1964, China has exploded 43 nuclear bombs: 23 in the atmosphere
(ceased in 1980); 20 underground (since 1969) plus three
unverified seismic events suspected to have been nuclear
explosions.  China's last atmospheric test was on 16 October 1980

<H3>TEST BAN SHOULD BE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
.</H3>
 

<P><B>Communities Across U.S. Commemorate Grassroots Victory With Call for Nuclear Abolition
<P>WASHINGTON, September 24th, 1996</B>

<p>Grassroots activists in over a dozen

U.S. cities commemorated today's signing of the long-sought
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in New York by organizing bell
tollings and other events to draw attention to the need for further
nuclear disarmament measures.   
 
<p>"The completion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a historic
moment in the decades-old quest for nuclear disarmament and it was
brought about by grassroots activism,"  said Greenpeace's Nuclear
Disarmament Campaigner Bruce Hall.  "In communities across the
country, bells will ring 51 times today to mark the damage done by 51
years of nuclear testing."
 
<p>Since the first nuclear test in 1945, there have been 2,046 nuclear
tests at more than 20 locations around the globe.  The Committee for a
SANE Nuclear Policy (now Peace Action), Women Strike for Peace, and
Physicians for Social Responsibility formed in the late 1950s and
early 1960s to oppose the blasts.  Greenpeace formed in 1971 when a
group of activists set sail toward Amchitka, Alaska to oppose a
planned US nuclear test on that island.  But despite decades of
intense public and diplomatic pressure, the test ban remained elusive
until negotiations started again at the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva in January 1994.  The 50th United Nations General Assembly
overwhelmingly approved the CTBT on September 10, 1996.
 
<p>"As we mark the important role of citizen activists in ending nuclear
weapon test explosions, we are also recommitting ourselves to the goal
of a nuclear weapon-free 21st Century," said Peggy Prince who
organized the commemoration taking place today in Santa Fe, New
Mexico.  After a noon rally and the tolling of the bells at St.
Francis Cathedral, there will be a caravan to Los Alamos National
Laboratory, which developed the first atomic bombs.  "We've made the

difference on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we can make the
difference on nuclear disarmament."
 
<p>Bulletin of Atomic Scientists editor Michael Moore will speak at
tonight's commemoration and bell tolling at the University of Chicago,
site of the first nuclear chain reaction.  Bell tollings are also
planned in Honolulu, Seattle, New York City, Philadelphia, Princeton,
New Jersey, and Washington, DC.  
 
<p>These events and others have been organized through the Disarmament
Clearinghouse - a joint project of Greenpeace, Peace Action,
Physicians for Social Responsibility, Plutonium Challenge, and Women's
Action for New Directions.  Citizens taking part will sign a People's
Pledge that describes the zero-yield CTBT as "a testament to the power
of grassroots activism and (as constituting) an important step toward
the unfinished task of grassroots of abolishing nuclear weapons."

UNITED NATIONS ADOPTS HISTORIC NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY;</H3>
 

<P><B>Greenpeace hails key "first step" on the road to disarmament.
<P>NEW YORK, September 10th, 1996:</B>
 
<P>Greenpeace today hailed the
overwhelming approval by the United Nations General Assembly of a
"zero-yield" Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  The international
environmental group urged the five nuclear powers to sign the
treaty as soon as it is opened for signature, and to commit
themselves to pursuing complete nuclear disarmament.
 
<P>"Twenty-five years ago this month, Greenpeace was launched to
peacefully protest nuclear weapons testing," said Bruce Hall,
Greenpeace Disarmament Campaigner.  "We view this treaty as a
milestone in the history of the nuclear age and an extraordinary
way to mark our anniversary."
 
<P>"We must now channel the overwhelming worldwide momentum toward
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into efforts to eliminate all
nuclear weapons," Hall added.
 
<P>The treaty was adopted late this afternoon by a vote of 158-3,
setting the stage for a signing ceremony expected to take place
on September 24.  However, the treaty can only take effect after
the signature and ratification of 44 specific countries,
including India, which so far refuses to sign.  Hall said it is
therefore essential that the United States and the other four
nuclear powers ratify the treaty as soon as possible, and affirm
their commitment never to test nuclear weapons again.

 
<P>"By building swift momentum towards ratification, we hope India
will soon feel confident enough about the chances for disarmament
to sign on," Hall explained.  "Ending nuclear testing is in
everyone's best interest, including India's."

 TIME TO TAKE NUCLEAR TEST- BAN TO NEW YORK:</H3>
 

<P><B>   Greenpeace urges submission of the CTBT to UN General Assembly
<P>GENEVA / AMSTERDAM, August 20th, 1996:</B>
  
<P>Greenpeace  today  urged 
countries  who want to see a permanent end to nuclear testing  to 
take the text of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to  the 
United  Nations (UN) in New York, in time for it to be signed  at 
the UN 51st General Assembly in September this year.
 
<P>"Despite  the disagreement in the Committee, there is now a  text 
of  a  treaty which cannot be allowed to just sit in  some  dusty 
archive in the United Nations", said Simon Carroll,  Greenpeace's 
representative at the CTBT negotiations in Geneva. "Although  not 
perfect,  the treaty would be sufficient to prohibit all  nuclear 
tests  forever  and ensure that this ban is complied  with.  It's 
time to take it to New York and get it signed."
 
<P>Today  the  report of the Committee which negotiated  the  treaty 
over the last two and a half years will be formally presented  at 
a  special Plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament.  The 
report  concludes that there was no consensus on the text of  the 
treaty  itself  or  on  what action should  be  taken  next.  But 
although the Conference on Disarmament can only take decisions by 
consensus, now that the Geneva negotiations have been  completed, 
there is nothing to prevent the great majority of countries  that 
support  the  text  from taking the draft treaty  to  the  United 
Nations General Assembly for endorsement and then signing. 
 
<P>"There  have  been over 2000 nuclear tests - an  average  of  one 
every  9  days over more than half a century", said  Carroll.  "A 
CTBT  is simply too important to lose -- failure could mean  that 
testing would eventually resume."
 
<P>Greenpeace  considers  that responsibility for failure  to  reach 
agreement in Geneva must be shared between those countries  which 
refused  to accept the text, especially India, and those  Nuclear 
Weapon  States,  in  particular the United  Kingdom,  Russia  and 
China,  who  took  inflexible positions on  several  key  issues, 
especially entry into force.
 
 <P>"The uncompromising position of the Nuclear Weapons States  once 
again  brings  into doubt their commitment to a CTBT.  To  remove 
this  doubt, they should be at the forefront of efforts to get  a 
CTBT  signed  in  New  York this year.  They  must  affirm  their 
commitment  not to resume nuclear testing pending the entry  into 
force  of  the CTBT and to take further measures leading  to  the 
elimination of nuclear weapons", said Carroll.

NUCLEAR TEST-BAN DELEGATES LOCKED INTO UNITED NATIONS
 :</H3>
 

<P><B>Greenpeace demands: Stay at work until the CTBT is agreed.

<P>GENEVA, August 6th, 1996:</B>



<P>On the 51st anniversary of the 
bombing of Hiroshima about 100 Greenpeace protestors today sealed the exits of
the United Nations headquarters in Geneva  in protest
at the delays in talks to achieve a ban on nuclear testing.
 
<P>Stressing the urgency of concluding the nuclear test-ban treaty, 
Greenpeace began the protest after diplomats arrived to discuss the ban and
said it would not let them leave until they had reached 

agreement on a treaty prohibiting all nuclear tests. Final agreement is 
being blocked at present largely by China and India who have thus far refused
to support the draft treaty presented by the Chairm
an at the end of June.

 <P>The Greenpeace activists, from a half-dozen countries, have chained  
themselves in a human barricade across the gates of the 'Palais de Nations' in
Geneva, where the negotiations of the Comprehensiv
e Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) are being held.
 
<P>"Fifty-one years is too long to wait for an end to nuclear testing. 
Now is literally the last chance to finally achieve this ban  and make it
international law. It must not be allowed to slip by," sa
id Michael Kuehn of Greenpeace. 
 
<P>Despite 32 months of negotiations, final agreement on a CTBT has 
proved elusive. According to Greenpeace, political issues not fundamental to
the effectiveness of a nuclear test-ban -- related
to the treaty's verification and entry-into-force in particular -- 
have been the main barrier to finally concluding the talks. Greenpeace believes
that delegates should adopt the text of a CTBT propo

sed by the Chairman at the end of June.
 
<P>"There is no point in jeopardising the end to nuclear testing in a 
futile effort to try and change a word here and there in the Chairman's draft",
said Kuehn. "The draft treaty does the job - it woul
d ban all nuclear test explosions anywhere, for all time. It's the 
first of a number of steps which must lead to the total elimination of nuclear
weapons".

DAY OF RECKONING FOR NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY :</H3>
 

<P><B>"CTBT Now !" demands Greenpeace

<P>GENEVA, July 29th, 1996:</B>

<P>As the United Nations (UN) 
Conference on Disarmament resumed today, a dozen Greenpeace activists placed a
large 'atomic bomb' outside the UN in Geneva with a b
er calling for the immediate conclusion of a ban on nuclear tests. 
 
<P>'This is literally the last chance for a nuclear test ban treaty', 
said Clement TOLUSSO, Greenpeace Campaigner in Geneva. "Unless a Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is adopted now, this historic 
opportunity to end more than fifty years of nuclear testing could be 
lost forever".
 
<P>Negotiations on the test ban treaty were suspended at the end of June 
with a handful of key issues unresolved - most importantly the question of how
and when the treaty should enter into force. Count
ries were split over whether or not countries like India, Pakistan 
and Israel should be required to join the treaty before it could become legally
binding. Russia and the United Kingdom were insistin
g on this, while other countries were deeply concerned that this 
could jeopardise the entire treaty.
 
<P>"Greenpeace urges all countries, including India and Pakistan, to 
join the CTBT. But it's foolish in the extreme to make a ban on all nuclear
tests completely dependant on whether these two countrie
 sign up", said Clement TOLUSSO.

<H3>TEST BAN DELEGATES FAIL TO MEET DEADLINE, BUT SUCCESS IS

<P><B>Agreement on CTBT must come when talks
resume on July 29.


<P>GENEVA, June 28th, 1996:</B>


 
 

<P>
  Greenpeace greeted the
presentation of a final text for the Comprehensive
nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) today with guarded
enthusiasm.
 

<P>"We are disappointed that due to the obstinance of a few
countries the test ban delegates have failed to agree a
nuclear test ban by the end of this part of the
Conference on Disarmament," Greenpeace Disarmament
Campaigner Josh Handler said.
 

<P>"But it is a success that Chairman Ramaker delivered the

final text today.  The negotiations are now finished. The
delegates have one last job to do - a decision to sign
the treaty must be made when talks resume on July 29, so
it can be ready for signing at the 51st UN General
Assembly in September."
 

<P>"The pressure is now really on the key problem countries:
the UK, Russia and China," said Handler. "They must now
prove that they do really want a CTBT."
 

<P>The UK, Russia, China and Pakistan are insisting on a
formula for Entry into Force that calls for specific
acceptance of the treaty by the five nuclear weapons
states AND the three threshold states -- India, Pakistan,
and Israel -- before it can take effect.
 

<P>However, India has made it clear that it would not
subscribe to a treaty that singled-out India's signing as
a precondition of the treaty entering into force.
 

<P>"Greenpeace urges India to join a test ban treaty, but we
don't want a treaty that can be held hostage to one
nation's unwillingness to sign," said Handler.  "It is
essential that the UK, Russia, China and Pakistan show
flexibility on this point."
 

<P>"To rid the world forever of nuclear testing will be a
great victory but a CTBT will not free the world of the
threat of nuclear weapons.  After getting the CTBT, the
nuclear weapons states, particularly Russia and the
United States, must take steps to reduce and eliminate
their nuclear arsenals." Mr Handler said.

BAN  MAY FAIL: GREENPEACE:</H3>
 

<P><B>commitment made at Moscow Nuclear Safety Summit.


<P>NAGASAKI, June 28th, 1996:</B>





<P>Greenpeace activists holding a 
ceremony of remembrance for atomic bomb victims in Nagasaki on 
the final day of the nuclear test ban talks in Geneva 
made a plea for the governments of Britain, Russia, China, and 
Pakistan to cease blocking agreement on the ban.  

<P>In a statement released after the ceremony at Nagasaki's Peace 
Park, Greenpeace said that 'the memory of the victims of nuclear 
weapons should be honoured by all countries agreeing to the ban 
without reservations'.

<P>The final draft text of the Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty (CTBT) is expected to be presented by the Chairman of  the
negotiations in Geneva later today.  It is expected that  the
Chairman, Ambassador Ramaker of the Netherlands, will  state that
negotiations are closed and request nations to sign  the treaty
without further changes.

<P>Fears have grown this week, however, that the hardline demand 
for veto power over the treaty by Britain, Russia, Pakistan  and,
to a lesser degree, China, could wreck the treaty.   Despite
opposition from many other countries, led by Canada and 
Australia, the four have not indicated that they will back off 
before the June 28 deadline passes.

<P>"A ban on all nuclear tests is the minimum first step to  nuclear
disarmament", said John Willis of Greenpeace Japan.   "Right now
a very small number of holdouts who either have or  could soon
have nuclear weapons, are blocking this first step.   This does
not appear to be a bargaining tactic, but a callous  bid to
preserve their own nuclear weapons by halting progress  towards
disarmament."

<P><B>COMMENTS ON THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN IN NAGASAKI ON THE FINAL DAY 
OF THE CTBT TALKS 

GREENPEACE JAPAN
28 JUNE 1995</B>


<P>Today is the final deadline for the completion of a CTBT, which 
comes 51 years after the nuclear attack which destroyed this
city.


<P>Today in Geneva, we understand that the Chairman of the 
negotiations will put forward a final text of a treaty, and 
request that all nations sign it and ratify it.


<P>Greenpeace believes that this text -- the evolution of which we 
have been following in detail for six months -- will be 
imperfect and will contain weaknesses that need attention.  
However, we also believe that extending the deadline and 
delaying the final draft treaty would allow certain nations to 
undermine a test ban and possibly even destroy it completely.


<P>The nations which are of greatest concern are the UNITED 
KINGDOM, RUSSIA, PAKISTAN, and CHINA.  These states are 
insisting (with various degrees of inflexibility) that a fixed 
list of specific nations must ratify the CTBT before it can 
become binding international law.  These nations would include 
all the recognised nuclear weapons states (FRANCE, UK, USA, 
RUSSIA, and CHINA), the three recognised 'threshold' states 
(INDIA, PAKISTAN, ISRAEL), plus a further group of some 29 
nations which have the technical means to monitor nuclear 
testing.

<P>This proposal would in effect give an open-ended veto to 37 
states, including all those who either have or are suspected of 
having nuclear weapons, over a ban on testing.  The 
unwillingness to compromise by the four countries proposing  this
veto formula seriously calls into question their good  faith and
raises the distinct possibility that they actually  seek to wreck
the test ban.  These nations are all either  nuclear-armed, our
could be in a short time-frame, and thus  their position on this
issue appears to be a cynical bid to  protect their nuclear
weapons from the disarmament process. 

<P>For this reason, Greenpeace concludes that negotiations on the 
CTBT must come to a close now, and that the final text as 
presented today by the Chairman be signed and ratified by all 
states, as is.  Imperfections are not desirable, but the 
alternative may be that we allow the opponents of a true 
comprehensive test ban to advance their own agenda, which would 
be much worse for the future of our world.

<P>Bearing in mind that nuclear weapons are designed, built, and 
tested for one purpose, which is to kill, we call on all 
countries to honour the victims of nuclear arms by agreeing to 
the nuclear test ban now, without reservations.

<H3>AS TEST BAN TREATY TALKS DRAW TO UNCERTAIN CONCLUSION IN GENEVA,
SENATE SQUASHES ATTEMPTS TO TURN BACK CLOCK ON U.S. NUCLEAR
TESTING:</H3>
 

<P><B>Greenpeace urges world leaders at G-7 Summit to save the treaty 


<P>WASHINGTON, June 27th, 1996:</B>


<P>Greenpeace and other disarmament
organizations claimed a decisive victory today with the defeat
on the Senate floor of a bill that would have cleared the way for
a resumption of U.S. nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. 
The victory came just before Friday's close of international
negotiations on a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
in Geneva, where tense disagreements over key questions threaten
to stymie the treaty.  

<P>Last night's 53-45 vote killed a dangerous attempt by Senators
Harry Reid (D-NV) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ) to relax the current U.S.
nuclear weapons testing moratorium by allowing a U.S. president
to resume testing after September 30, 1996.  The bill was a
thinly-veiled attempt to enable the U.S. to conduct one more
series of nuclear tests before the CTBT enters into force.
 
<P>"The people have faced down America's nuclear arms proponents at
a key time, and stated once and for all that we do not want our
tax dollars spent honing weapons of mass destruction," said
Greenpeace Disarmament Campaigner Bruce Hall.  "We must now seize
on this momentum and close down the nuclear weapons test sites. 
Otherwise, Cold Warriors like Kyl and Reid will keep trying to
turn back the clock on disarmament."  
<P>With just hours left for nations to agree on a CTBT, negotiations
appear to be on a tightrope.   The U.S. remains at loggerheads
with nuclear powers Britain and Russia, and with "threshold"
states Pakistan and India, over the question of when and how the
treaty would enter into force.  Greenpeace sources in Geneva
expect a final treaty text to be tabled tomorrow afternoon, but
final acceptance apparently must wait until talks resume on July
29.
 
<P>Today Greenpeace called on leaders of the key nuclear and
industrial states, now gathering for a G-7 Summit meeting in
Lyon, France, to intervene on behalf of the CTBT.
 
<P>Following its peaceful anti-nuclear mission to China two weeks
ago, the ship MV Greenpeace arrived today in Nagasaki, Japan.
Greenpeace campaigners are meeting with the Mayor of Nagasaki,
to press jointly for a successful conclusion of the CTBT, and
will participate in a ceremony at Nagasaki's Peace Park on
Friday, to remember the victims of nuclear weapons on the final
day of CTBT negotiations (photos will be available through Kyodo
News Wire Service).

<H3>GREENPEACE SHIP ARRIVES AT NAGASAKI AS FRANCE INDICATES
IT IS READY TO SIGN CTBT:</H3>
 

<P><B>commitment made at Moscow Nuclear Safety Summit.


<P>NAGASAKI, June 27th, 1996:</B>





<P>The anti-nuclear campaign
ship  MV Greenpeace has arrived in  the  Japanese port
city of  Nagasaki, one of the two places on  earth to
have been deliberately attacked with nuclear weapons.
 

<P>The ship's arrival coincides with the final days of talks
in  Geneva to negotiate a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban
Treaty  (CTBT).  Greenpeace campaigners on-board the ship
told a press conference that there is a threat that the
treaty would never enter into force because of a refusal
by the UK, China, Pakistan and Russia to compromise.
 
<P>"The Russian, Pakistani, British, and Chinese delegates
to the CTBT Conference in Geneva should come to Nagasaki
to reflect upon the real purposes of nuclear
weapons  -- to kill, to eliminate human life," said Kazue
Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan.
"As a first step toward total nuclear disarmament, we
must have a zero-yield nuclear test ban without delay",
she said.
 
<P>At the CTBT talks in Geneva today, France announced that
it would be willing to adopt the Chairman's draft of the
treaty, with some changes to the text relating to Entry
into Force.
 
<P>France is the first of the Nuclear Weapons States (NWS)
to announce a willingness to adopt the treaty. Greenpeace
is calling on the other NWS to follow suit and for
Jacques Chirac to raise the issue at the G-7 meeting in
Lyon.
 
<P>"Jacques Chirac must convince John Major to make an
urgent compromise on the UK's position on Entry into
Force," Greenpeace Disarmament Campaigner Josh Handler
said.
 
<P>"The G-7 leaders must remember that they made a
commitment to conclude and sign a CTBT by the end of
1996, just six weeks ago at the Moscow Nuclear Safety
Summit. They need to act now so the CTBT can be finished
by tomorrow.
 
<P>The second session of the Conference on Disarmament
closes tomorrow, June 28. For the CTBT to be ready for
signing at the 51st UN General Assembly in September, it
should be finished by the end of this negotiating
session.

<H3>G7 LEADERS MUST THROW WEIGHT BEHIND CTBT - GREENPEACE:</H3>
 

<P><B>Urgent compromise needed to complete treaty on time


<P>LYON, June 27th, 1996:</B>



 

<P>Greenpeace is calling on the leaders of
the key nuclear and industrial states, gathering for a G-7
Summit meeting in Lyon, France today, to make the compromises
needed if a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty is to be
agreed to this week.
 
<P>Only two days remain for delegates to the CTBT in Geneva to
finish the final text if the treaty is to be ready for signing
in September as agreed by the United Nations last year.
 
<P>A failure to compromise on how the treaty will eventually
Enter into Force, could mean that delegates will miss the end
of  June deadline.
 
<P>On Tuesday, Pakistan reiterated its position - in common with
the UK, Russia and China - that before the treaty can Enter
into Force all five nuclear weapons states PLUS the three
"threshold" states, India, Pakistan and Israel must sign the
treaty.
 
<P>India however has made it clear that is would not subscribe to
a treaty that specified India's signing as a pre-condition of

the treaty taking effect.
 
<P>"Unless a compromise can be found between these two positions
the CTBT will not be ready for signing on time," Greenpeace
Disarmament campaigner Josh Handler said.
 
<P>"Britain, France and the USA - three of the five nuclear
weapons states - are represented at the G-7 in Lyon and they
will be joined by Russia. These leaders must take steps to
ensure the CTBT is finalised by Friday."
 
<P>"Clinton, Chirac, Major, and company could solve these
remaining problems in an instant," he said.  "The world wants
and needs a CTBT now."

<H3>GREENPEACE PRESENTS SPANISH SENATE WITH THOUSANDS OF SIGNATURES AGAINST CHINESE NUCLEAR TESTING, AS JIANG ZEMIN VISITS:</H3>
 

<P><B>One million signatures gathered world-wide


<P>MADRID, June 25th, 1996:</B>

 

<P>At ten o'clock this morning,  members of Greenpeace delivered  20000 signatures from 50 different countries against Chinese nuclear
testing on behalf of the million signatures gathered world-wide for this reason,
delivered in the Chinese embassies around the world.
 

<P>Greenepace has asked the President of the Spanish Senate to pass the signatures to
the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, who is visiting the senate today.
 

<P>"We want to tell the Chinese government, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of citizens around the world and the majority of the Spanish society, to commit to a total ban on nuclear testing."
 

<P>Meanwhile, China is still blocking the negotiations at the Disarmament
Conference in Geneva,  where a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is being discussed. China wants to leave the door open door to carry out so-called "Peaceful” nuclear explosions (PNEs) in the future. There is only a week left for negotiations to reach a conclusion if the Treaty is to be ready for signing by the end of 1996. 
 

<P>Greenpeace demands that the Chinese government halt nuclear testing now and accepts a total nuclear test ban, prohibiting and ALL kinds of nuclear tests.
 

<P>At the same time, Greenpeace denounces the totally irresponsible behaviour of
the Spanish Government, who has not  spoken out against China's nuclear test of June 8, or against China's position on the CTBT.

<H3>UK, CHINA, RUSSIA AND PAKISTAN MUST COMPROMISE IF THE WORLD IS
TO GET NUCLEAR TEST BAN THIS YEAR:</H3>
 



<P>GENEVA, June 24th, 1996:


<P>UK, China, Russia and Pakistan must
compromise on Entry-into-Force provisions if the world is to
have a CTBT ready for signing this year, Greenpeace said
today.
 
<P>Amendments to the draft treaty, presented by Chairman Jaap
Ramaker today,  show that no progress has been made toward
resolving the issue of how the treaty would Enter into Force.
Mr Ramaker has not amended the unworkable Entry into Force
provision he proposed three weeks ago due mainly to
inflexibility by Russia, the UK, China and Pakistan.
 
<P>Russia, the UK, China and Pakistan are still insisting on a
formula for Entry into Force that is dependent on the five
nuclear weapons states PLUS the three "threshold" states --
India, Pakistan, and Israel -- signing the treaty before it
can take effect.
 
<P>However, India made it clear in a speech last week that it
would not subscribe to a treaty that singled-out India's
signing as a precondition of the treaty entering into force.
 
<P>"The negotiators in Geneva must find a compromise," Greenpeace
Disarmament Campaigner Josh Handler said.  "There is no point
trying to bully India into being part of a treaty that does

not meet India's critical concerns. The best solution would be
a simpler Entry-into-Force provision that includes the big
five nuclear weapons states together with some 30-40
unspecified states, and makes a stronger commitment to nuclear
disarmament."
 

<P>Greenpeace believes that an acceptable compromise alternative
would be the one proposed by the Chairman last Friday, despite
its complexities. This compromise would guarantee that the
treaty could enter into force, without allowing one country to
block that process.
 
<P>There are only four days left for delegates to negotiate a
treaty that could be ready for signing in 1996.
 
<P>"If CTBT negotiators cannot solve these problems by Thursday,
Greenpeace will be looking for last minute intervention by the
leaders of the key nuclear and industrial states at the G-7
meeting in Lyon to get the CTBT," said Handler.  "Clinton,
Chirac, Major, and company could solve these remaining
problems in an instant."

and visit the city's Peace Park on the final day of the CTBT 
talks in Geneva.
 
 

<P>The ship was recently expelled from Chinese waters off Shanghai 
while campaigning against China's position in the treaty 
negotiations, which threatens to undermine the intent of the 
test ban.  
 

<B><P>Time:               1400h

<P>Date:               27 June 1996

<H3>ONLY ONE WEEK LEFT TO THE END OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE OF DISARMAMENT NEGOTIATIONS FOR A CTBT :</H3>
 

<P><B>Chinese President JIANG ZEMIN is visiting Spain: GREENPEACE will actively protest to demand the end of nuclear testing

<P>GENEVA, 22nd June 1996</B>  



<P>Greenpeace stated today, in a press conference held in Majorca (Spain), that it will peacefully protest during the official visit to Spain of the President of the People’s Republic of China, Jiang ZEMIN, in order to force the Chinese Government to sign a truly Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) based on the  Zero Yield  option. 

<P>Greenpeace spokespersons also denounced the irresponsible position of the Spanish Government and its Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, who is yet to condemn the June 8th Chinese nuclear  test at Lop Nor and has not officially rejected the Chinese proposal of leaving the door open to  Peaceful Nuclear Explosions.

<P>The Chinese President’s visit  to Spain starts on Sunday, 23 when he arrives in Majorca. Then, he will fly to Madrid for two days, and then spent another day (Wed, 26) in Barcelona. Greenpeace will be protesting during the whole visit.

<P>Xavier Pastor, Executive Director of Greenpeace Spain, who has just returned to Spain after heading up a peaceful protest voyage to China on board the MV Greenpeace, and  Carlos Bravo, GP Spain anti-nuclear campaigner,  denounced the irresponsible position of the Spanish Government who is silent about the nuclear testing programme of China and its unjustifiable position on PNEs in Geneva.

"Spain is now a full member of the Conference of Disarmament,"Mr Bravo said. “Unjustifiable commercial Spanish interests are the reason behind Spain’s official silence."

In particular, the interests of the Spanish Government, at present negotiating several contracts to sell aircraft carriers to China and the intent of a desperate Spanish nuclear industry to obtain some contracts in China, are forcing the Aznar Government to keep completely quiet about the Chinese  position in the CTBT negotiations.

"An absolute and immense majority of the Spanish population is in favour of banning  all nuclear tests or nuclear explosions forever. The attitude of the Spanish Government of favouring particular commercial interests is clearly opposed to the wish of the Spanish society" , stated Bravo.

<H3>GREENPEACE RESPONSE TO INDIA’S STATEMENT TO THE CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT:</H3>
 

<P><B> "Special Treatment"
would undermine test-ban.

<P>GENEVA, 20th June 1996</B>
 




<P> India will not achieve its “quest for world peace” by blocking progress at  talks to negotiate a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty or threatening to opt out of the treaty, Greenpeace said today.

<P>A Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty that prohibits all nuclear tests is the first step to total nuclear disarmament and any delay to the signing of the treaty is a delay on the road to a nuclear free world.

<P>Greenpeace applauds India’s sentiments expressed in today’s speech, but deplores any veiled threats that it would refuse to sign a CTBT.  Greenpeace believes it is essential to ban all nuclear weapons explosions and that all countries, including India, should join a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty to achieve that goal.

<P>If the five Nuclear Weapons States (China, France, UK, Russia, USA) want India to support the treaty they should make a commitment not to develop, produce or deploy new nuclear weapons and to seek greater nuclear disarmament -  instead of using Entry Into Force requirements to bully India into joining the CTBT.

<P>In contrast to other delegations to the Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty  negotiations in Geneva, China is not ready to declare a total nuclear test ban, proposing on a ten-year moratorium for so-called “Peaceful” nuclear explosions. 


<P>World-wide Greenpeace has collected almost 700,000 signatures calling for an immediate prohibition of all nuclear explosions. Most of the signatures have been handed to the respective Chinese embassies in the countries they were collected.  Greenpeace Switzerland today handed 30, 000 signatures and photographs to the Chinese UN-mission in Geneva, fastened to a 30 metre rope and carried by 25 activists.


<P>For 25 years Greenpeace has fought for a complete ban of all nuclear tests. Until last year the nuclear weapon states would only commit to restraints on the size of explosions. A complete ban first became possible at the peak of the campaign against the French nuclear tests in the South Pacific when France, the USA and Great Britain announced they would sign a zero-yield. Russia joined this group in the spring 1996. 


<P>China is alone in insisting that Peaceful nuclear explosions be included in the treaty and on Tuesday (June 18), made a formal proposal that PNEs be reviewed in 10 years and that review be automatic unless a majority of countries vote against it.


<P>China remains the main obstacle to the signing of a total nuclear testing ban Greenpeace is appealing to the members the UN-Conference not to make weak compromises to the treaty, and to ban both military and "civil" atomic bomb tests once and for all.

<H3>GREENPEACE CALLS ON CTBT DELEGATES TO OPPOSE CHINA's
'PEACEFUL' NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS' PROPOSAL:</H3>
 

<P><B> "Special Treatment"
would undermine test-ban.

<P>GENEVA, 19 June 1996</B>
 

<P> China formally introduced its proposal
to include so-called "Peaceful" Nuclear Explosions in the
final wording of the Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty, at
a `closed-door' meeting in Geneva last night (Tuesday June18).
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling on CTBT delegations to join Mexico,
Canada, Japan and Australia in strongly opposing the Chinese
proposal and to call for a test ban that prohibits all nuclear
tests for all time.
 
<P>Under China's proposal, Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs)
would be reconsidered at  a review conference 10 years after
the CTBT enters into force. Review would be AUTOMATIC unless a
majority of parties voted against it.
 
<P>On 6 June, China unofficially suggested at a plenary session
that China would accept a zero-yield CTBT but ONLY IF
countries accepted China's idea that PNEs should be
specifically reviewed in the treaty in 10 years time.
 
<P>"Any nuclear explosion can be used to gather information for
building nuclear weapons - the Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban
Treaty must ban all nuclear tests of any kind if the true
intention of the treaty is to rid the world of nuclear tests,"
Greenpeace spokesperson Josh Handler said.
 
<P>"China's proposal on PNEs has been widely mis-reported as a
concession or compromise that clears the way for getting a
CTBT by the end of June, but China has conceded nothing.
Acceptance of a zero-yield treaty is still being held hostage
to China's insistence that PNEs be legitimized in the treaty
in some form."
 
<P>The U.S. and the Soviet Union conducted some 150 nuclear
explosions for peaceful purposes between 1961 and 1988 before
they were abandoned as unnecessary and dangerous technology.

<P><B>Greenpeace Calls for Redoubled Efforts for Successful Conclusion of CTBT Talks</B>
<P><B>GENEVA, 17th June 1996: 12 noon</B>





<P>Greenpeace applauded today's decision to admit a further twenty-three countries as full members of the Conference on Disarmament and called on the new members to bring fresh impetus to the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty (CTBT).
 

<P>'Many of these countries have long-standing and deeply held views on nuclear disarmament', said Josh Handler, Greenpeace Disarmament Campaigner. 'Their addition to the Conference on Disarmament may provide the much-needed boost
to complete a CTBT by the end of June'.
 

<P>If the CTBT is to be completed in time for signing in 1996, the treaty must be adopted by the Conference on Disarmament within the next two weeks. While the number of issues still to be resolved are few, they are also deeply divisive and go to the heart of the viability and effectiveness of the nuclear test-ban.
 

<P>These issues include whether special treatment is accorded to so-called 'Peaceful Nuclear Explosions' in the review, as insisted on by China; the regime for On-Site Inspections, and the mechanism governing the eventual entry-into-force of the
CTBT.


<P><B>The 23 new members of the Conference on Disarmament:

<P>Austria		|		Bangladesh		|	Belarus|
Cameroon	|		Chile		|		Colombia|
Finland	|		Iraq	|			Israel  |
New Zealand	|		Norway	|		Republic of Korea|
Senegal		|	Slovakia		|	South Africa  |
Spain			|	Switzerland	 |		Syria |
Turkey		|		Ukraine		|	Vietnam  |

<H3>MV GREENPEACE ARRIVES IN HONG KONG AFTER EXPULSION FROM CHINESE WATERS DURING ANTI-NUCLEAR PEACE VOYAGE</H3>
 
<P><B>HONG KONG, 16th June 1996: 12 noon</B>


<P>The MV Greenpeace sailed into Hong Kong this
morning, three days after campaigners met People's Republic of China officials
and called on China to commit to a total nuclear test ban.
 
<P>"We successfully delivered our message to the Chinese government," said Xavier
Pastor, the senior campaigner on board the MV Greenpeace.  "The Chinese
government cannot escape the fact that their ongoing nuclear weapons tests are
jeopardizing the talks for an end to nuclear testing.  The world is calling for
an end to all nuclear tests for all time and China is currently the major
obstacle to achieving that."
 
<P>China's obstinate position that a review of so-called "Peaceful" Nuclear
Explosions be written into the Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty, threatens
to destabilize treaty discussions, taking place in Geneva until June 28.  Less
than two weeks remain for delegates to negotiate a treaty that could be ready
for signing in 1996.
 
<P>Earlier this month China announced it would agree to a CTBT only if a ban on
so-called "Peaceful" Nuclear Explosion (PNEs) would be reviewed in 10 years.
 
<P>"Any nuclear test can be used to gain information for the development of
nuclear weapons," Mr Pastor said.  "China is being hypocritical to say it
supports a CTBT while insisting on a review that could allow them to detonate
'peaceful' nuclear explosions in the future."
 
<P>China is the only declared nuclear weapons state with an active nuclear testing
program and on June 8, detonated its 44th nuclear test, provoking world-wide
condemnation, including protests from the governments of at least 17 countries
and some of China's neighbors: Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, New Zealand,
Australia, the Philippines and South Korea.  China plans to explode another
nuclear weapons test before September.
 
<P>The crew of the MV Greenpeace - 32 people from 16 nations - endured a tense
four hours in Chinese territorial waters off Shanghai on Wednesday, June 12,
when approximately 70 Chinese soldiers, outnumbering the crew by two to one,
boarded the ship and cut its communications.
 
<P>Mr Pastor added: "This campaign is not over.   With just two weeks to go before
the CTBT negotiations fail or succeed, Greenpeace will continue to press all
countries to join together in taking this historic step towards ending the
nuclear arms race.  We have a way to go before ridding the world of all nuclear
weapons, but such a journey must begin with the decisive first step - an end to
nuclear testing."
 
<P>The MV Greenpeace will be moored in Hong Kong until the evening of Thursday
June 20.  It will be open to the public on Wednesday June 19 from 12pm to 8pm
and on Thursday from 10am to 4pm.  Launches will run to and from the Tsim Sha
Tsui public pier at regular intervals throughout both days.  There will be
exhibitions on board the ship explaining the work of Greenpeace, and everything
is free of charge.

<H3>MV GREENPEACE EXPELLED FROM CHINESE WATERS: SETS COURSE TO HONG KONG</H3>



<P>East China Sea, June 12th 1996


<P>The MV Greenpeace set a course for Hong Kong today after being boarded by approximately 70 unarmed Chinese soldiers, who took control of the ship and expelled it from Chinese waters.

<P>Speaking from on-board the MV Greenpeace, nuclear campaigner Xavier Pastor said: "We believe we have achieved what we came here to do - before the ship was expelled the Chinese officials received our message to stop nuclear testing and commit to a total nuclear test ban and agreed to deliver it to the authorities in Beijing."

<P>In a ceremony held on board the heli-deck of the MV Greenpeace, the crew  - representing 16 nations -  presented the Chinese officials with anti-nuclear testing gifts from around the world.

<P>The peaceful voyage was timed to coincide with talks in Geneva to negotiate a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  There are now less than three weeks left if delegates are to agree a treaty to be ready for signing before the end of 1996. 

<P>China's position at the CTBT talks and it's nuclear testing programme remain major obstacles to  achieving a nuclear testing ban in 1996. China announced last week that it would agree to a CTBT ONLY IF a ban on so-called "Peaceful" Nuclear Explosions (PNEs) could be reviewed in 10 years.
    
<P>On Saturday, June 8th, China detonated its 44th nuclear test, provoking world-wide condemnation, including protests from many of it's neighbours: Australia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, New Zealand, the Philippines and South Korea. China plans to explode another nuclear weapon test before September.

<P>"We have achieved what we could on this voyage and we now call on world leaders to take up the protest and demand that China stop nuclear testing and commit to a truly Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty, without compromise for so-called "peaceful" nuclear explosions," Mr Pastor said.

<P>The MV Greenpeace is approximately three days sailing time from Hong Kong.  A press conference will be held in Hong Kong when the boat arrives.

<H3>Statement from Regional Representatives on board the MV Greenpeace</H3>
<P><B>On board the MV Greenpeace, off the coast of China, 12th June 1996</B>

<P>We, the representatives of neighboring NGO's of Asia and the 
Pacific are here to carry our message of peace to the Chinese 
people.  We are not here to interfere with Chinese internal affairs 
and sovereignty.  We just want to ask China to participate and 
contribute to world peace.

<P>In the same manner that we are concerned for the victims of 
radiation in Mururoa and other nuclear test sites in the world, we 
are also concerned with the impact of nuclear testing to the health 
and the environment of the indigenous people of Lop Nor.  

<P>We call on China to cancel its scheduled nuclear testing in 
September and to conclude the CTBT without conditions now.

<H3>GREENPEACE BOAT ARRIVES OFF CHINESE COAST TO DELIVER 'STOP NUCLEAR TESTING'
MESSAGE</H3>
 
<P><B>HONG KONG, 12th June 1996: 12 noon</B>



 

<P>The MV Greenpeace arrived off the Chinese
coast today at 11.34am local time.
 
<P>No attempt has been made to prevent the ship from entering Chinese territorial
waters and there are no Chinese naval vessels in sight.
 
<P>The ship is heading to an anchorage area near Changjiang Kou buoy, near the
mouth of the Yangtze river which leads to the port of Shanghai.  The vessel is
signaling for a pilot to continue its entry into the port of Shanghai.
 
<P>The peaceful voyage of the MV Greenpeace has been timed to coincide with talks
in Geneva to negotiate a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). There
are now less than three weeks left if delegates are to agree a treaty to be
ready for signing before the end of 1996.
 
<P>Speaking from on board the MV Greenpeace, senior campaigner Xavier Pastor said:
"We bear a message which is supported by millions of people around the planet -
China must stop nuclear testing immediately and commit to a truly Comprehensive
nuclear Test Ban."
 
<P>China's position at the CTBT talks and its nuclear testing programme remain

<H3>MV GREENPEACE NEARS CHINESE WATERS:
REITERATES NEED FOR IMMEDIATE NUCLEAR TEST BAN</H3>
 
<P><B>HONG KONG, 11th June 1996</B>
<P>The MV Greenpeace is one day's sail from
Chinese national waters off Shanghai on its voyage to deliver a
peaceful message to China to stop nuclear testing and commit to a
total nuclear test ban.

<P>At midday the ship reported it was approximately 100 miles off
Wenzhou, a coastal city in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.  It is
estimated the MV Greenpeace will approach Chinese territorial
waters off Shanghai tomorrow (WEDNESDAY) morning.

<P>The voyage has been timed to coincide with talks in Geneva to
negotiate a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  There
are now less than three weeks left if delegates are to agree a
treaty that could be ready for signing before the end of 1996. 
China's position at the talks and nuclear testing program remain
major obstacles to achieving a CTBT in 1996.

<P>China announced last week that it would agree to a CTBT ONLY IF an
allowance was included in the treaty for a ban on so-called
"Peaceful" Nuclear Explosions (PNEs) to be reviewed in 10 years.

<P>Speaking from on board the MV Greenpeace, nuclear campaigner Xavier
Pastor said:  "ANY nuclear explosion - peaceful or otherwise - can
be used to gain information for developing nuclear weapons and the
CTBT should ban any and all nuclear tests.  China's position of
linking PNEs in the review to its support of a comprehensive test
ban is unacceptable.  China's position still remains a major
obstacle to getting an effective CTBT by the end of June."

<P>China detonated a nuclear weapon at its Lop Nor test site on
Saturday and announced it would test again before September. 
Saturday's test sparked condemnation around the world.  Sixteen
countries have criticized the renewed testing program, including
many of China's neighbors: Australia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia,
New Zealand, the Philippines and South Korea.

<P>"China's testing plan underscores the urgency of our peace visit,"
said Mr Pastor.  "The world wants an end to nuclear testing now. 
We are sailing to Shanghai to keep up the momentum for achieving a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  With less than three weeks of
negotiations to go, China needs to push for this historic treaty,
not conduct further nuclear tests."

<P>At 4pm local time (0800GMT) the MV Greenpeace, on a peaceful voyage to China, reported that her position was 80 nautical miles northeast of O luan pi, the southern tip of Taiwan. 
 
<P>The Dutch flagged vessel, with 32 Greenpeace and other crew on board from 16 different nations, is sailing to Shanghai in a bid to open direct discussions with officials in China about nuclear disarmament and the crucial talks progressing in Geneva towards a Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). 
 
<P>The Greenpeace vessel left Manila on Saturday, June 8, at 1810 local time, the same day that China conducted a nuclear weapons test which was condemned by a number of countries around the planet including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea and the United States. 

<P>China's 20 80 kiloton nuclear test was carried out even as CTBT talks are ongoing at the United Nations in Geneva.  Greenpeace has carried out protests at Chinese embassies and consulates in more than a dozen countries around the world. 
 
<P>The MV Greenpeace is expected to arrive in the waters off Shanghai on Wednesday, June 12. 
 
<P>Neither the MV Greenpeace nor Greenpeace International has yet had a reply to its message sent yesterday to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and senior Shanghai municipal authorities.  The letter advised the officials of the ship's progress and requested talks in Shanghai between Greenpeace and Chinese officials about nuclear disarmament and an immediate end to nuclear testing.

<H3>MV GREENPEACE SENDS MESSAGE TO CHINA,
 REQUESTS ENTRY TO SHANGHAI
 </H3>
 
<P><B>HONG KONG, 10th June 1996</B>
 

<P>The MV Greenpeace, a campaign ship of the
environmental group Greenpeace, today (SUNDAY) sent an open letter to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin requesting his assistance in facilitating the ship's
visit to Shanghai.  
 
<P>The international environmental organization has sent its flagship to Shanghai
in a bid to engage Chinese officials in a dialogue around ending nuclear tests.
 
<P>The message from the ship, which was faxed via satellite to President Jiang and
senior Shanghai municipal authorities, called for discussions with Chinese
leaders on the "serious matters of nuclear disarmament and an immediate end to
nuclear testing".
 
<P>Signed by Xavier Pastor, the senior Greenpeace campaigner on board the ship,
the letter voiced concern about China's ongoing nuclear weapons testing program
and its effect on crucial negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).
 
<P>"The June 8 nuclear weapons test at Lop Nor and your country's announcement
that another test is planned by September, have underscored the urgency of our
visit to Shanghai," Mr Pastor wrote.
 
<P>From the MV Greenpeace, Mr Pastor said: "China has long called for nuclear
disarmament. They now have the opportunity to provide leadership in assuring a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  They can either secure or sacrifice a ban on
nuclear tests for all time.
 
<P>"Ongoing testing neither complies with the intent nor the spirit of the CTBT.
The Chinese must choose between developing weapons and developing peace."

<H3>CHINA'S TEST UNDERMINES NUCLEAR TEST BAN TALKS </H3>
 
<P><B>HONG KONG, 8th June 1996</B>



<P>Greenpeace condemned today's 20-80 kiloton Chinese
nuclear weapons test and called on world leaders to protest the action and
demand that China show the utmost restraint while negotiating a Comprehensive
nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
 
<P>The environmental group said that its ship, the MV Greenpeace, would sail today
from Manila to continue its peaceful voyage to Shanghai to deliver a message to
China of worldwide opposition to nuclear testing and nuclear weapons.  The ship
should arrive off China around 11 June.
 
<P>"This nuclear test is deplorable, particularly as it occurs at such a sensitive
time in the test ban negotiation," said Damon Moglen, a Greenpeace
International spokesman.
 
<P>"China is not only jeopardising the CTBT and impending progress on nuclear
disarmament, it is now the only nuclear weapons state with an active testing
program.  International public opinion should condemn China's tests as strongly
as it did those of France."
 
<P>News of the test was broken by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation in
Canberra, Australia.  From its seismic monitoring stations, scientists reported
that a presumed Chinese test at Lop Nor took place today at 1056 local time
(0256 GMT) with an estimated body-wave magnitude of 5.7.  The survey estimates
that the explosion's yield was in the range of 20 to 80 kilotons of TNT - a
blast as much as five times more powerful than the bomb which destroyed
Hiroshima.
 
<P>Today's test was China's 44th.  China is now the only nuclear weapons state
with an active testing programme.  More tests are expected as part of China's
prgrammed of nuclear weapons development.
 
<P>"This test does not deter us from sailing to Shanghai, rather it strengthens
our resolve to take our peaceful message direct to China," said Xavier Pastor,
campaigner on board the MV Greenpeace.

<HR>
<P>SUGGESTION FOR A LETTER TO AMBASSADORS 

<br>
<P>Your Excellency,

<P>I want to protest strongly against the nuclear test China held
in Lop Nor on 8 June. This is the third time your country
has set off a nuclear test since the signing of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty in May 1995. 

<P>At the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) conference in
May 1995, your country promised to "excercise utmost restraint" in
the field of nuclear testing.  By continuing to test
nuclear weapons, your country blatantly defies the spirit of
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aims to put a stop to
the spread of nuclear weapons. 

<P>It also sets back the current negotiations about the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, by provoking other countries to
develop and test nuclear weapons because you do. You cannot
ask other countries to hold back on acquiring their own nuclear
arsenal unless the states which currently hold nuclear weapons
show they are prepared not to use them. Your country, as well
France, must set an example for world peace and stop
testing nuclear weapons, instead of actively continuing
the nuclear threat. 

<P>I urge you to reconsider any further plans for nuclear tests
immediately, and start working towards eliminating all nuclear
weapons by adopting a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty now.

<P>Yours Sincerely,

<br><br><br><br>

<H3>MV GREENPEACE SETS SAIL FOR SHANGHAI TO DELIVER STOP NUCLEAR 
TESTING MESSAGE </H3>
 
<P><B>MANILA, 7th June 1996</B>



<P>The ship MV Greenpeace will 
depart Manila tomorrow on the final leg of its journey to 
Shanghai to deliver a peaceful message to China to stop 
nuclear testing and commit to a total nuclear test ban. 
The peace voyage has been timed to coincide with talks 
taking place in Geneva to negotiate a Comprehensive nuclear Test 
Ban Treaty (CTBT). Only three weeks remain if CTBT 
delegates are to agree a treaty before the end of June. 

<P>China announced this week that it would only agree to a zero 
yield CTBT if an allowance was included in the treaty for a ban 
on so-called "Peaceful" Nuclear Explosions (PNEs) to be reviewed 
in 10 years. 

<P>"China is placing pre-conditions on a total nuclear test ban and 
is weakening the ban before it has even been agreed. We are 
calling on the govenments at thwe conference
delegation to the conference to strongly oppose China's 
proposal, " Greenpeace campaigner Josh Handler said. 
"Special treatment for PNEs is unnecessary because under the 
current draft of the treaty any issue can be raised at 
future review meetings. And yet by highlighting PNEs China raises 
the possibility that they could be conducted in the future. ANY 
nuclear explosion - peaceful or otherwise - can be used to gain 
information for developing nuclear weapons and the CTBT should 
ban any and all nuclear tests,"
<P>"The world is on the verge of agreeing a truly Comprehensive 
nuclear Test Ban Treaty and we are sailing to Shanghai to be sure 
that China knows that now is the time to secure a 
future free of all nuclear testing," Handler said. 





<P><B>NOTE:</B> China is the only nuclear weapons state with an active 
nuclear testing programme and is reportedly planning to 
conduct its 44th nuclear test within days. Other countries have 
conducted peaceful nuclear explosions in the past but the 
practice has been abandoned by all of them due to 
considerable environmental problems, the lack of any 
tangible benefits and major concerns about nuclear 
proliferation.

<H3>GREENPEACE REJECTS CHINA'S CONDITION ON NUCLEAR TREATY </H3>

<P> Calls "Insulting" Requests for Provisions in CTBT to Allow 
"Peaceful Nuclear Tests" 
<P><B>WASHINGTON, June 6th 1996</B>

 

<P>Greenpeace dismissed as "insulting" 
China s proposal today at the  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
talks in Geneva that would leave open the possibility of 
conducting so-called 'peaceful nuclear explosions' in the future. 
 
<P>China announced Thursday that it would agree to a zero-yield CTBT 
only if the treaty would allow a ban on 'peaceful nuclear 
explosions' to be reviewed in 10-years. China's official 
announcement stated, "the Chinese delegation is now ready to go 
along with a temporary ban on peaceful nuclear 
explosions...[provided that] the possibility of permitting the 
conduct of peaceful nuclear explosions shall be considered by the 
review conferences of states parties." 
  
<P>The current draft treaty already states that any issue can be 
raised at a review conference in 10 years. "Giving special 
treatment to 'peaceful nuclear explosions' would substantially 
weaken the treaty," said Greenpeace disarmament campaigner Bruce 
Hall in Washington. He dismissed China's statement saying, "There 
is nothing peaceful about nuclear explosions. This is an insult 
to common sense and to all the nations of the world legitimately 
committed to nuclear disarmament."  
 
<P>Monitoring the CTBT talks in Geneva, Greenpeace's Simon Carroll 
said,  "Special treatment for peaceful nuclear explosions leaves 
open the possibility that they could be conducted in the future. 
ANY nuclear explosion can be used to gain information for 
developing nuclear weapons. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
should be just that: comprehensive. It should ban ANY and ALL 
nuclear explosions."  
 
<P>China is the only nation currently conducting nuclear tests, with 
preparations now underway for another blast. Greenpeace called 
on the Clinton administration to strongly oppose China's CTBT 
proposal and call on the Chinese to immediately join the 
worldwide testing moratorium.  
 
<P>Hall also said the U.S. should cancel its own  'subcritical' 
nuclear weapons tests, slated to begin June 18th at the Nevada 
Test Site.  In an article headlined, "US postpones nuclear 
tests,"  the Asia Times newspaper reported today, "an official 
announcement [from the U.S.] would be made by the weekend."   
 
<P>"Postponement is not good enough," said Greenpeace's Hall. "Just 
like China, the U.S. tests need to be cancelled and their test 
site shut down."                               ###

<H3>GREENPEACE SLAMS CHINESE NON-COMPROMISE ON 'PEACEFUL'
NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS</H3>
 
<P><B>GENEVA, 6th June 1996</B>


<P>Greenpeace has slammed a proposal
put forward by China  at Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban
treaty talks in Geneva today,  that would allow for a ban
on  so-called 'peaceful nuclear explosions'  to be
reviewed in 10 years.
 
<P>The organisation called on delegations to the Conference
on Disarmament to strongly oppose China's proposal
because "special treatment" for peaceful nuclear
explosions would severely undermine the effectiveness of
a nuclear test-ban.
 
<P>"China is placing pre-conditions on a total nuclear test
ban, weakening the ban before it has even been agreed.
China is effectively holding the CTBT hostage,"
Greenpeace spokesperson Simon Carroll said.
 
<P>"The main purpose of a nuclear test-ban is to prohibit
ALL nuclear explosions of any size for any purpose
whatsoever and any door left open for peaceful nuclear
explosions (PNEs), is simply a quick exit from a true and
effective nuclear test-ban treaty. All countries should
reject China's non-compromise."
 
<P>China announced that it would agree to a zero yield CTBT
only if  "....the possibility of permitting the conduct
of PNEs shall be considered by the review conferences of
states parties".
 
<P>Greenpeace believes that giving special treatment to PNEs
is unnecessary because the current draft treaty already
states that any issue can be raised at a review
conference in 10 years.
 
<P>"Special treatment for PNEs leaves open the possibility
that they could be conducted in the future. ANY nuclear
explosion - peaceful or otherwise - can be used to gain
information for developing nuclear weapons and the CTBT
should ban ANY and ALL nuclear tests," Mr Carroll said.
 
<P><B>NOTE:</B> Other countries have conducted peaceful nuclear
explosions in the past but the practice has been
abandoned by all of them due to considerable
environmental problems, the lack of any tangible benefits
and major concerns about nuclear proliferation.

GREENPEACE OPPOSES COMPROMISE ON 'PEACEFUL' NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS: "Special Treatment" would undermine test ban.
 </H3>
<B>GENEVA, 3 June 1996</B>    Greenpeace today expressed opposition to any special compromise that would leave open the possibility for so called 'peaceful nuclear explosions' under a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The organisation called on all the nations taking part in the negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament to oppose such a move because "special treatment" for
peaceful nuclear explosions would undermine the effectiveness of the nuclear test ban.
 <P>
"The main purpose of a nuclear test ban is to prohibit all nuclear explosions of any size for any purpose whatsoever", said Greenpeace spokesperson Josh Handler.  "Any door left open for peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs), is simply a quick
exit from a true and effective nuclear test ban treaty. All countries should reject any such compromise."
 <P>
Only China is insisting that peaceful nuclear explosions should not be prohibited. Recent reports indicate that China might accept a compromise that would prohibit PNEs for now, but would require the treaty to review PNEs in 10 years time.
 <P>
"Giving special treatment to PNEs in the treaty is unnecessary and dangerous.   Unnecessary because the current draft treaty already states that any issue can be brought up at the review conference in 10 years. Dangerous, because giving special status to PNEs and leaving open the possibility that they could be
conducted in the future, would undermine the effectiveness of the treaty    a peaceful nuclear explosion can be used to gain important information for developing nuclear weapons."
 <P>
China has stated that it does not want to ban peaceful nuclear explosions as it may need to conduct these in the future as part of its industrial development.  While other countries have conducted peaceful nuclear explosions in the past,
the practice has been abandoned by all of them due to considerable environmental problems, the lack of any tangible benefits and major concerns about nuclear proliferation.

GREENPEACE HEAD WELCOMES DRAFT NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY AND CALLS FOR RAPID
COMPLETION OF TALKS</H3>
<B>GENEVA, 28 May, 1996</B>    (GP) Greenpeace International Executive Director, Thilo
Bode, welcomed this afternoon's presentation of a complete draft nuclear
test ban treaty at the Conference on Disarmament as a 'major step' towards
completing the treaty on schedule by the end of June.<P>
Bode was especially pleased that the draft treaty ruled out all nuclear
explosions whatsoever, including so called Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs),
which China has been seeking to allow under the treaty.<P>
"A test ban treaty that allowed small nuclear tests or peaceful nuclear
explosions would not make any sense and could not be called 'comprehensive",
said Bode. "The draft presented today can form the basis of a treaty to end all
nuclear tests forever."<P>
Greenpeace considered that the introduction of the draft treaty by the Chairman
of the negotiations to be a very important development, he explained. 'With
this text as a starting point, it is possible to work towards completing the
treaty by the end of June', said Bode. 'Two things can undermine this   another
nuclear test by any country, or a failure of political will."<P>
Bode stated also that the environmental organisation's flagship,  the MV
Greenpeace, was continuing on its voyage to China. "At present our ship is
sailing to Manila, following a successful stopover in Sydney", said Bode. "From
Manila,  our ship intends to go to Shanghai with Greenpeace's message of peace
and a call to end all nuclear testing".<P>

<H3>MV GREENPEACE TAKES ON NEW ANTI NUCLEAR CHALLENGE</H3>
 <P>
Sydney, Monday, 20 May 1996:   The MV Greenpeace, seized in 
protests against nuclear testing at Moruroa last year, 
arrived in Sydney this morning from New Zealand. The ship 
sails for China tomorrow on a new mission to urge China to 
end its nuclear testing programme.
<P> 
China is reported to be planning to conduct its 44th nuclear 
test imminently, and is blocking agreement of a ban on 
nuclear testing because of its insistence on  peaceful 
nuclear explosions  being excluded from the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty currently being negotiated in Geneva.
 <P>
The MV Greenpeace sails as talks in Geneva reach crisis 
point with just seven weeks left to reach agreement on the 
treaty. Even if China does sign the treaty, Beijing has said 
it will continue to test until the treaty comes into force   
the timing of which is dependent on agreement between all 
the nuclear weapons states and other countries at the 
negotiating table. 
<P> 
Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Jean McSorley said:  China 
and the other nuclear powers must take responsibility for 
agreeing on a treaty. If Governments cannot agree to a 
treaty in June, we will not have a complete test ban this 
year,  she said.  They have only seven weeks left and our 
voyage to China aims to bring that urgency to world 
attention.
 <P>
 It is a timely mission for the ship as Greenpeace 
commemorates 25 years of campaigning against nuclear 
testing. We hope that this is the last time we have to set 
sail in order to achieve as end to nuclear testing,  said 
McSorley.
 <P>
There will be a media conference on board the MV Greenpeace 
at 10.30am today, Monday 20 May at Thames Street Wharf, Mort 
Bay, Balmain.
 <P>
The MV Greenpeace is then scheduled to depart Tuesday, May 
21, at approximately middy for Manila, en route to Shanghai 
on 13th/14th June.

    <H3>GREENPEACE DECLARES UNITED NATIONS IN GENEVA A RADIOACTIVE
               EXCLUSION ZONE AS TEST BAN TALKS RESUME
</H3>
<B>GENEVA - 14 MAY 1996 (GP)</B> - Forty activists from Greenpeace
Switzerland established a 'radioactive exclusion zone' around the
Palais des Nations in Geneva this morning as the opening plenary
meeting of the second part of the Conference on Disarmament got
underway. Declaring the site 'contaminated by nuclear testing',
Greenpeace established a checkpoint at the entrance bearing the legend
"ALL NUCLEAR TESTS POLLUTE THE EARTH - BAN ALL TESTS NOW !".
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament resumes its talks on a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this week, with just seven
weeks remaining for the negotiations if the treaty is to be
completed on schedule by the end of June. Unless this deadline
is met, the treaty will not be able to be signed this year. 
<P>
The Greenpeace 'checkpoint' with its mobile barrier established
an exclusion zone around the United Nations site which the
environmental organization declared "politically and
radioactively contaminated" in protest at the slow progress of
the negotiations.
<P>
"Because of nuclear weapons testing, numerous places around the
world are contaminated by radioactivity. Unless all nuclear
testing is stopped, this can only get worse.", said Wendl Hilti,
Greenpeace Switzerland's nuclear campaigner. "Here in Geneva the
diplomats are getting lost in the details and engage in endless
rhetoric. This approach risks failing to agree a treaty at all.
This cannot be allowed to happen - its time to complete a test
ban treaty which will prohibit all nuclear explosions." 
<P>
With the United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia
accepting that a ban should prohibit all nuclear tests,
Greenpeace sees the position of China and its plans to conduct
further nuclear tests as the single biggest barrier to the
completion of the negotiations.
<P>
Since 1964, China has exploded 43 nuclear tests at Lop Nor and
has developed the fourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world.
Its nuclear weapons have a combined power equivalent to 17,000 Hiroshima bombs.

	<H3>TIME RUNNING OUT FOR TEST BAN TREATY TALKS<BR>
	Greenpeace Sails For China as China Prepares Next Nuclear Test</H3>
 
<B>GENEVA, 13 May 1996</B> -  (GP) Only seven weeks remain for an agreement on a ban on all nuclear weapons testing or the opportunity could be lost forever, Greenpeace said today at a press conference a day before the Geneva based Conference on Disarmament resumed.
<P>
With China remaining as the only country intending to conduct more nuclear tests -  the first of which is expected any day -  Greenpeace's Xavier Pastour announced that the organization will send its vessel, the MV Greenpeace, to China.  The vessel will depart on 15 May from Auckland, New Zealand, having completed repairs after its protests against French nuclear tests last year, he said.  Pastour, who lead the same vessel into the French nuclear testing site at Moruroa, will be aboard the vessel as Campaign Coordinator.
 <P>
"Millions of people around the world expect an end to nuclear tests now," said Josh Handler, Disarmament Coordinator for Greenpeace. "If Governments cannot agree to a treaty by June, we will not have a test ban this year. They have only seven weeks left. The clock is ticking."
<P>
According to Greenpeace, only a few obstacles remain to achieving the treaty, but a handful of countries, especially those with nuclear weapons, are refusing to make the compromises needed to gain agreement.  Of the declared nuclear weapons states, only China is planning  further underground test explosions. It is expected to conduct  its 44th nuclear test in May or June this year while CTBT talks are under way.
<P> 
"This treaty can be won or lost in discussions between the White House, the Kremlin and Beijing," said Handler. "It remains to be seen whether Governments make the commitments in Geneva that will match their rhetoric of recent months."
<P>
After leaving New Zealand, the MV Greenpeace will visit Sydney and Manila before arriving off the coast of Shanghai in early June to demonstrate the region's opposition to China's test plans.  This would mark Greenpeace's first ship visit to mainland China.<BR>

<P>Moruroa, South Pacific 2330pm BST-- French commandos have boarded
peace flotilla support vessel MV GREENPEACE in international
waters off Moruroa as France delayed its first nuclear test.

<P>New information from the Rainbow Warrior confirms that the ship's

been right over the place," radio operator Tim Gorter said using
a hidden satellite phone in the first contact with the Rainbow
Warrior crew since their arrest.

<P>Rainbow Warrior captain Jon Castle is still inside the ship's
crows nest on the mast.  Most of the ship's crew are being held
on the deck while commandos await a tow vessel.  It is believed
that the journalists aboard are being taken to Tahiti.

<P>Two Greenpeace divers, who positioned themselves under the test
monitoring platform within the Moruroa lagoon, were arrested
before the MV Greenpeace boarding.  They are American Bill Mosca
and Austrian Heinz Smital.  No contact has been made with either
since their arrest. 

<P>The MV Greenpeace, a Dutch-flagged vessel carrying a New Zealand-
registered helicopter was boarded outside the 12-mile exclusion
zone in international waters. Communications with the vessel were
severed during the boarding.  

<P>"France has not only boarded the MV Greenpeace in international
waters but it has also tried to silence the Rainbow Warrior,"
said Greenpeace campaigner Thomas Schultz in Tahiti.  "This can
only mean it intends to hide its nuclear tests -- from people
opposed to nuclear testing worldwide as well as from their own
citizens."

<P>For more information, contact:
Thomas Schultz, Greenpeace International, Tahiti: +689 770613;
Jean McSorley, Greenpeace New Zealand, ++649 377 6128; or
Greenpeace Communications: +44 171 833 0600

<P>Note to Editor:

<P>Greenpeace Executive Director Steve D'Esposito has issued a plea
for all protests taking place in the event of French testing to
be peaceful.  For a copy of the statement, please contact the
numbers above.</body></html>

<h2>A message from</h2>
<img alt="County Kildare Supporting Greenpeace" width=475 height=168 src="images/kildare.gif"></center>
<font size="+1">
Greenpeace Ireland is not wealthy. Greenpeace Ireland does not accept money from Government or Industry, and so it is a truly independent watchdog for the protection of the environment. Greenpeace Ireland does not recieve financial assistance from Greenpeace International, in order that the organisation can expand into new territories in the Far East. <i>It is only as strong as the support it gets in this country</i>.<p>

Greenpeace Ireland relies totally on us, the people of Ireland, to fund it's campaigns. Right now the campaign is the <a href="clean_water/index.html">Millennium Clean Water Campaign 2000</a>, to respond to the serious threat of pollution to Ireland's drinking water. Our waterways are polluted from many sources, including agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage effluent, leachate from dumps and runoff from forestry and peat harvesting practices.<p>

Greenpeace Ireland has called for our help to ensure that Ireland will have clean water for the year 2000 and beyond.<p>

The people of County Kildare are responding to that call with the launch of the scheme &quot;County Kildare Supporting Greenpeace&quot;, whereby small groups of active members throughout the county will organise celebrations, fundraisers and special events in support of Greenpeace Ireland. Please support our scheme and become an active member of Greenpeace.<p></font>

<h2>Think about Greenpeace and what images come to mind?</h2>
...tiny inflatable dinghies, struggling with gigantic waves, trying to stop the dumping of radioactive waste off Russia or prevent the slaughter of whales in Antartica? Or people swathed in protective clothing and masks blocking pipes to stop gallons of poison polluting our seas? Or climbers unfurling a banner on a toxic waste incinerator in Cork to draw attention to another abuse of the environment?<p>
<h3>Environmental crimes are commited simply because nothing is done to stop them. That's why Greenpeace believes in non-violent direct action. When the safety of the planet is in the balance...</h3><br></td>
<td width=50%>
<h2>...ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER</h2><br>
Since 1971 Greenpeace has been at the cutting edge, getting it's hands dirty, taking risks and taking on governments and big business.<br>
As well as peaceful direct action, Greenpeace lobbies governments and industrialists and gathers evidence to build legal cases to take through the courts. Greenpeace enables it's supports to voice their dissent, as tens of thousands did to protest against THORP, the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield.<p>
<h2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Whatever it takes, Greenpeace will continue to defend the earth through non-violent direct action.</FONT></h2></td></tr></table>
<h2>Who's behind Greenpeace?</h2>
<h3>PEOPLE LIKE YOU</h3>
4,500,000 supporters worldwide make Greenpeace what it is. 4,500,000 ordinary people playing their part in the fight for clean air, fresh water, the protection of wildlife and a safe and nuclear free planet.<br>
It is Greenpeace policy not to accept money from corporations nor from governments. Greenpeace is not affiliated to any political organisation. We refuse to compromise our independence so that whenever the environment is threatened, we are free to target our campaigns at whoever is responsible.<br>
To have a chance, Greenpeace needs everyone who is worried by what is happening to get behind us. Whether we succeed or fail depends on the commitment of people like you. Every time one more person joins our supporters, Greenpeace gets bigger and stronger.<br>

<img src="images/millennium.gif" height=315 width=296 alt="Millennium Clean Water Campaign"></center><p>
The Greenpeace Ireland Clean Water Campaign, launched on the River Shannon this year flagged the
need to ensure that the Irish people have clean water coming into the new millennium and beyond.<p>

The greatest legacy we can leave to future generations is clean, fresh water. Our delicate inland water-ways are suffering under the onslaught of a concoction of polluting discharges. Sewage, slurry, industrial wastes, dump leachate, fertilisers, forestry and peat bog runoff, all make their way into our waterways.<p>

Nutrient levels in the water are increasing. Public health is at risk. Water sports enthusiasts have seen events cancelled. The past months have seen a number of major fish kills in the Shannon alone. We can't ignore the warning signals.<p>

Its time we shouted STOP. Everyone needs to take responsibility for protecting the water. Our very survival depends on it.<p>

Greenpeace have called, and will continue to call, on the government to take an integrated, catchment based approach to policies aimed at protecting our rivers. Greenpeace have shown that the solutions are available, reed bed technology for the treatment of slurry and sewage, dry or low flush toilets, phosphate-free detergents. Let's use them.<p>

Greenpeace are urging individuals, communities, everyone, to take ownership of their rivers once again. Celebrate what they were and what they can be once again. Over the next four years
Greenpeace will be celebrating many more of Ireland's river systems. Through "Living Downstream", our school education project, River-watch groups and our water quality database, we are strengthening our role as an independent watchdog for the environment.<p>

Join with us by beginning to celebrate your river now.<p>
<hr>

The Millennium Clean Water Campaign was launched in March 1996 on board the Brad&aacute;n Feasa.
Over a two week period Greenpeace travelled up the length of the Shannon - celebrating the river, listening to the people and offering solutions.<p>

Over 500,000 people reside in the Shannon catchment. Over one fifth of this population receive their drinking water directly from the rivers. A vital point. Greenpeace strongly support those who are willing to take the initiative and begin protecting the health of our water. Viable solutions have been demonstrated.<p>

The excess input of plant nutrients, nitrogen, potassium and, especially phosphorus, through sewage, slurry and fertiliser discharges, has resulted in many of the problems the waterways are facing this summer. The growth of toxic algae has resulted in the deaths of animals and the cancellation of water sports events. Delicate ecosystems within rivers and lakes are at breaking point, and the stress is beginning to show.<p>

The solutions presented by Greenpeace are not new, in fact other European countries have been using some of them for years. The promotion of constructed wetlands, or reed beds, as a clean and efficient alternative to conventional sewage treatment plants is one possibility.<p>

There are already a number of constructed wetlands in operation in Ireland. The first one was constructed for the Curragh Camp during the 1800's.<p>

A constructed wetland, is an artificially created ecosystem. Reeds, lilies and other wetland plants are planted over' layers of clay and gravel beds. The waste water' from both slurry and sewage can be passed through the head of the reed bed. As it filters through the underlying layers, the plants take nutrients up out of the water. Bacteria in the water attach on to the clay particles, leaving a discharge equal to that coming out of a conventional tertiary sewage treatment facility. At 20% of the cost of conventional treatment systems, constructed wetlands are a viable alternative.<p>

<b>A nation-wide ban on phosphate-based detergents.</b><p>

Up to one sixth of the phosphorus, (the plant nutrient causing many of the problems in Irish water-ways), in waste water comes from fabric washing processes.<p>

Many European countries including Belgium and Germany, have reduced the market for phosphate-based detergents through legislation, voluntary agreements and public pressure on detergent manufacturers.<p>

Phosphate-free detergents are available. Public pressure on supermarkets can make these alternatives more readily available. This is one solution that everyone can be involved in implementing! Buy phosphate-free detergents, and get everyone you know to buy them.<p>

How can you tell if they are phosphate-based or not?<p>

Look at the ingredients box found on the side of any detergent pack. It will list a number of different ingredients like surfactants and bleaching agents. The bulk of most powders is made up of a substance known as a 'builder', which assists in removing dirt from fabrics. Phosphate is used as a builder. If it is contained in your pack it will be listed. Often up to 30% of the pack will be phosphate. Look for packs containing an alternative builder, called zeolite.<p>

<b>A reduction in agricultural wastes through a move to sustainable agriculture</b><p>

Up to two thirds of phosphorus entering our water ways can be attributed to agricultural sources. Severe pollution events in the past have resulted from bad management practices involving slurry disposal. There are guidelines for good practice now available through Teagasc aimed at improving the way farms are managed to reduce pollutant sources.<p>

By integrating solutions into a catchment-based management policy for all waterways, we can go a long way towards ensuring clean water for the next generation.<p>

Since the first Greenpeace ship, the Phyllis Cormack, sailed 
into the US atomic test site at Amchitka, Alaska in 1971, the 
campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons has been a mainstay 
of Greenpeace's work. Combined with international work to end 
nuclear energy generation and to stop nuclear waste dumping and 
reprocessing, Greenpeace is determined to END THE NUCLEAR AGE.<hr>
<p>
<img align=right width=402 height=41 src="images/journeys.gif">
<br clear=all>
<FONT COLOR="#FB8D10">In 1972, David McTaggart, now Honorary Chair of Greenpeace 
International, began what would become a series of voyages to 
the French Test Site at Moruroa Atoll in the South Pacific. 
Sailing his yacht "Vega", McTaggart and his crew spent 20 days 
at the test site before finally being detained by the French 
authorities.<p>

The next year McTaggart returned to Moruroa. This time Vega was 
boarded by French commandos and McTaggart was badly beaten. 
Photos of the beatings smuggled to the worlds press brought 
international outrage to bear on France.<p>

Greenpeace ships have returned to Moruroa consistently to try to 
bring an end to France's testing programme. But it was in 1985 
that the issue really came to international attention. While 
preparing to set sail to Moruroa the Greenpeace flagship, 
Rainbow Warrior, was blown up by French secret service agents in 
Auckland, New Zealand resulting in the death of photographer, 
Fernando Pereira.<p>

This did not deter Greenpeace who immediately sent the MV 
Greenpeace in its place. Right up to 1995 when the replacement 
Rainbow Warrior and MV Greenpeace were brutally seized by French 
commandos at Moruroa, Greenpeace crews have borne witness to the 
plight of the South Pacific.<p>


But it is not only French testing which has been the focus of 
Greenpeace campaigns. Actions at the US test site in Nevada, at 
the Soviet Union's Test Site in Novaya Zemlya and in 1995, the 
first ever Greenpeace action in China, have been central to the 
Greenpeace aim of achieving a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</FONT> 
<hr>
<p>
<img width=460 height=36 src="images/react.gif"><br>

Closer to home the Greenpeace Nuclear Campaign has focused on 
the dangers presented by nuclear reprocessing at Sellafield in 
England and LaHague in France. <p>

Greenpeace has blocked shipments of nuclear waste to and from 
the plants, it has consistently fought legal battles against 
reprocessing, it has lobbied around the world for an end to this 
nightmare and most dramatically, in 1987 two Greenpeace members 
were jailed in Britain for blocking the Sellafield discharge 
pipeline.<hr><p>

<img align=right width=444 height=34 src="images/herecomesun.gif"><br clear=all>
<FONT COLOR="#FB8D10">
Now Greenpeace is working to make nuclear power obsolete. 
Intensive research and lobbying around the world to promote the 
solar alternative is central to the Greenpeace Campaign. Ten 
years on from the world's worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl it 
is time to start the Solar Revolution. </font><hr>

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><CENTER><h2>RAINBOW WARRIOR FREE</h2></CENTER></FONT>

The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior sailed from Hao atoll into 
international waters on 19th March, five months after being seized 
by the French at Moruroa.
The Rainbow Warrior and the MV Greenpeace were both detained at the 
Hao military base, while the Vega, La Ribaude and Manutea were 
released from captivity at Moruroa a week before.


The captains of both the Rainbow Warrior and the  MV Greenpeace 
were under pressure from the French authorities to leave Hao as 
soon as possible.  The skipper of the Rainbow Warrior, Andy Troia, 
would not leave until the MV Greenpeace was released, so the two 
ships could sail together for safety reasons.
"Our ships are in bad disrepair and we have not had adequate 
time to check all the systems on board," he said.  "Both ships 
will require extensive repairs before returning to campaign 
work, and Greenpeace will be able to decide their destinations 
only after seeing how they handle at sea."

<i><font size=+1>Talks to agree a 'Peaceful Nuclear Co-operation Agreement' between
the European Union and Japan could soon begin. Such an Agreement
would enable nuclear trade between Europe and Japan to expand more
easily.<p>

Greenpeace sees this proposal as a further threat to the
environment and to nuclear non-proliferation, in that it will assist the
expansion of the global trade in nuclear weapons materials. This cannot
be in the interest of Ireland or the EU as a whole.</font></i></td></tr></table>
</center>
<br>

<font size=+1>
The European Commission and Japan have begun informal talks with the
objective of securing a 'Peaceful Nuclear Co-operation Agreement' between
Japan and the European Union.<p>

If, and once, official negotiations are embarked upon, the talks will be based
on the <a href="http://www.cec.lu/en/comm/euratom/euratom.html">EURATOM</a> Treaty. This Treaty, the European Atomic Energy
Treaty, is one of the original three Treaties of the Common Market.<p>

Before the Commission can begin formal negotiations with Japan, however,
they must first get the approval of the EU Council of Ministers. This matter
may be on the Council's agenda as early as October. If Council approves,
then the Commission will most likely open negotiations with Japan before
the end of the year, i.e. during the Irish Presidency.<p>

BNFL (operators of the Sellafield site) are desperate to secure new large
contracts to supply plutonium-fuel to Japan. If this Aggreement proceeds then
Japan will take it as a signal that the EU, including Ireland, supports
plutonium reprocessing and nuclear fuel fabrication.<p>

Aside from the day-to-day environmental risks posed by Sellafield, this
agreement is inherently linked to the transportation of plutonium fuel from
Europe to Japan. This is most likely to be by sea, but may be by air.<p>

Ireland must stop this happening. The decision at Council will most likely
need to be by qualified majority in line with Article 101 of Euratom which
states:</font><p>

<CITE>&quot;The Community may, within the limits of its powers and jurisdiction, enter into
obligations by concluding agreements or contracts with a third State, an
international organization or a national of a third State.<p>

Such agreements or contracts shall be negotiated by the Commission in
accordance with the directives of the Council: they shall be concluded by the
Commission with the approval of the Council, which shall act by a <B>qualified
majority</B>&quot;.
</CITE><p>

<font size=+1>Qualified Majority means 62 out of 87 votes in favour of the Mandate for
the Commission. Therefore, Ireland will have to enlist the support of other
Member States to stop this.</font><p>

<CENTER><table bgcolor="#f0f0f0" border=1 cellpadding=10><tr><td align=center><b>Voting in the Council of Ministers</b><br><br>
Member States' votes are weighted on the basis of population size as follows:<br><br>

10 votes to Germany, France, Italy, UK<br>
8 votes to Spain<br>
5 votes to Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece<br>
4 votes to Austria, Sweden<br>
3 votes to Finland, Denmark, <b>Ireland</b><br>
2 votes to Luxembourg<br><br>

making 87 votes in total. Adoption of a proposal from the Commission by qualified<br>

majority requires 62 votes out of the 87.<br>
</td></tr></table></CENTER>

<p><font size=+1>
These negotiations, if given the go ahead, will be conducted on behalf of all
EU member states, not just the nuclear states. Ireland must seek support to
oppose the Mandate. To do anything else would be hypocritical. Ireland's
endorsement of a so-called 'Peaceful Nuclear Co-operation Agreement' with
Japan would be rightly interpreted as contrary to its historical role in
promoting effective nuclear non-proliferation and in calling for an end to
reprocessing at Sellafield/THORP.</font><p>

At a Press Conference to mark the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl 
accident Greenpeace said that unless governments world-wide 
begin a rapid programme to shut down all nuclear reactors another  
accident, another Chernobyl,  will  occur. The statement was by 
two  Ukrainians  -- Natalia Proebrazhenska, a scientist and 
Volodymyr Usatenko, an engineer and politician -- who travelled to 
Ireland as part of the Greenpeace  Chernobyl 10th Anniversary 
Testimonies Tour.<p>

Both  Ms  Proebrazhenska and Mr Usatenko spoke of the  devastation  -
-  the deaths, the human health problems, the contamination of 
agricultural land and  drinking water,  and  the  widespread  fear of 
having  children  --  caused  by  the Chernobyl accident 10 years 
ago.<p>

Ms Proebrazhenska is concerned about the fate of the children and has  
been involved since May 1986 when she assisted in the evacuation  of  
children from Kiev. Over the past ten years she has devoted her life 
to helping with medical  research, getting medical equipment and 
supplies, and  to  working closely with sick and dying children.
"Chernobyl continues to cause much agony and suffering. It is only 
now that we are beginning to see its real effects," she said. "I now 
work for an end to  nuclear power globally. I do not wish to see this 
horror happen  again, anywhere.<p>

Volodymyr  Usatenko,  a  Deputy of the Ukrainian  Parliament  and  a  
power engineer  by training, became involved in the Chernobyl issue 
in 1987  when he spent 60 days at the plant with the military 
reserves assisting with the clean up of the accident site.</td>
<td>"The present post-Chernobyl plight of Ukraine is an example to the 
world of the  consequences of nuclear power. The question is not 
whether  French  or American or UK reactors are of a better design 
than those of Chernobyl, but whether  we  are  willing to live and 
die with a  dangerous  technology,  a technology out of control," he 
said.<p>

John Bowler, Campaigns Director of Greenpeace Ireland, drew  the  
links between  Chernobyl  and the threat posed to Ireland  by  
Britain's  nuclear stations.<p>

"Everyone  in  Ireland  knows of Sellafield and  its  associated  
risks  to Ireland,  but we must remember that there are many nuclear 
power plants  on Britain's  west  coast, bordering the Irish Sea. A 
serious accident at any of these would be disastrous for Ireland. 
According to the Radiological Protection Institute the Chernobyl 
accident could cause up to 25 fatal cancers here over a 70-year 
period. Imagine the consequences to  Ireland in the event of an 
accident at a British plant. Wylfa in  North Wales for instance is 
less than one hundred miles away," he said.<p>


Ten  years  after  the Chernobyl accident, is now more apparent than 
ever that nuclear power is an ultimate problem, rather than the 
ultimate solution.<p>

In its Testimonies Report Greenpeace  offers  first  hand  accounts  
by  those  who experienced  the Chernobyl disaster and now live with 
the  consequences. Testimonies  is a stark reminder of the real price 
humanity has to pay  for nuclear technology.<p></td></tr></table>

Greenpeace  believes  that  now  is the time to build  a  future  
based  on realistic,  safe  and  sustainable energy sources  that  do  
not  carry  the environmental,  health and financial costs associated 
with nuclear  energy. The operational  Chernobyl  reactors  generate  
about  5%  of   Ukraine's electricity.  A new energy study released 
by Greenpeace earlier  this  week shows  that increased energy 
conservation, wind power and the  transfer  of surplus energy from 
western Europe could remove the country's dependency on Chernobyl. 
Greenpeace has estimated that wind-based energy production alone 
could eventually produce between 10 and 15% of the Ukraine's 
electricity needs.
<p>
Now is the time to start to implement a New Energy  Deal. Nuclear 
power is not  safe and  it is certainly not sustainable. A world-wide 
nuclear phase-out is  the only way forward.

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Aanwezig zijn op de plaats waar de natuur geweld wordt aangedaan.
Op een opvallende manier laten zien wat er mis is en hoe het
anders kan. Dat was de filosofie achter de allereerste Greenpeace-actie,
25 jaar geleden.</FONT></B><P>
Greenpeace is een internationale, onafhankelijke actie-organisatie.<BR>
Spectaculaire, altijd geweldloze acties zijn het
meest zichtbare deel van het Greenpeace-werk, maar ook
wetenschappelijk onderzoek, overleg met politiek en bedrijfsleven,
en deelname aan vele internationale overlegorganen zijn
belangrijk. <BR>
Greenpeace stelt mondiale milieuproblemen aan de kaak
&eacute;n dwingt oplossingen af die van essentieel belang zijn voor een
gezonde, 'groene' toekomst.<P>

<PRE>Opvallende Greenpeace-actie in de 
jaren zeventig: op de ijsvelden van 
Newfoundland (Canada) bespuiten 
actievoerders de pels van jonge 
klapmutsen en zadelrobben met een 
onschuldige, felgroene kleurstof. 
Zo wordt de vacht voor de jagers 
waardeloos.
Zie ook: <A HREF="wat4.html">Successen.</A></PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<HR>

<B>Oorspronkelijk</B> richtte Greenpeace zich vooral op oceanen, zee&euml;n en
rivieren en alles wat daarin leeft en daarvan afhankelijk is,
zoals zeehonden en walvissen. <P>

De laatste jaren pakt Greenpeace,
naast deze 'klassieke' onderwerpen, ook andere problemen aan.<BR>
Milieuproblemen houden niet op aan de wal of bij de grens: zo
vinden we bestrijdingsmiddelen die gebruikt worden bij de
katoenteelt in het Caribisch Gebied terug in Noordzeevis. <BR>
En onder de Noordpoolkap zijn radioactieve deeltjes aangetroffen die
geloosd zijn door de Engelse nucleaire opwerkingsfabriek in
Sellafield. <BR>
Milieuproblemen gaan ook steeds meer de hele wereld
aan, zoals het versterkte broeikaseffect (met klimaatverandering
als ingrijpend gevolg) en de aantasting van de ozonlaag. Ook de
internationale handel in gevaarlijk afval laat zien dat een
mondiale aanpak noodzakelijk is.

<H1>Greenpeace en vrijwilligers</H1>


Het succes van Greenpeace berust voor een groot deel op de inzet van
vrijwilligers. De strijd voor een schoner milieu doet een beroep op de
inzet van velen. Zonder de betrokkenheid van duizenden vrijwilligers
over de hele wereld zou Greenpeace vandaag niet de organisatie kunnen
zijn die ze is. En zouden vele succesvolle stappen naar een schonere
wereld (nog) niet genomen zijn.<P>

Amsterdam, 16 december 1996

<P>
<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>ROUTE NUCLEAIR TRANSPORT 
GEMARKEERD MET BORDEN EN SPANDOEKEN
</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>
Greenpeace-activisten hebben vanmorgen vanaf 5.00 uur de route 
gemarkeerd in Zeeland en West-Brabant die de vrachtwagen met 
gebruikte nucleaire brandstof uit de kerncentrale Borssele neemt op 
weg naar het Franse Cogéma. Langs de route zijn op twintig plaatsen 
borden neergezet met 'Stop opwerking¹, geen radioactief transport' en 
spandoeken aan viaducten gehangen met 'Geen radioactief transport'. 
De activisten zijn begonnen in de buurt van de Belgische grens en 
geëindigd bij de centrale.
<P>
Greenpeace protesteert al geruime tijd tegen de waas van 
geheimzinnigheid die om de transporten hangt. Volgens de 
milieuorganisatie zouden de omwonenden van de route op de hoogte 
moeten worden gehouden van het tijdstip van de transporten en van de 
gevaren die er aan kleven. Lokale autoriteiten zijn pas op de hoogte 
sinds Greenpeace aandacht vraagt voor dit onderwerp. Echter niet 
nadat zij zélf initiatief hadden genomen om meer details te horen te 
krijgen over de radioactieve transporten. Ook een ruime meerderheid 
van de Tweede Kamer wil meer weten over de transporten en heeft 
daarom minister Wijers van Economische Zaken (EZ) gevraagd een 
onderzoek te starten naar alle aspecten van opwerking. Het resultaat 
wordt eind januari 1997 verwacht.
<P>
De grootste doorn in het oog van Greenpeace is elk gebrek aan 
noodzaak voor deze uiterst riskante transporten. De gebruikte 
nucleaire brandstof  kan beter worden opgeslagen bij de Covra, een 
speciale opslagplaats vlakbij de kerncentrale. Niet dat opslag dé 
oplossing voor het grote nucleaire afvalprobleem is, maar dan hoeft 
er tenminste niet mee worden rondgereden.
<P>
In België is grote ophef ontstaan nadat de radioactieve transporten 
weer volop in de belangstelling kwamen te staan. Daar immers rijdt de 
vrachtwagen met hoog-radioactief materiaal direct door de dorpskernen 
aan de route naar Frankrijk. Burgemeester J. Schenkels van Zelzate 
heeft gedreigd de geladen vrachtwagen te zullen tegenhouden.
<P>
Dat de transporten nog steed plaatsvinden komt omdat Borssele 
opwerkingscontracten heeft afgesloten met Cogéma. De contracten 
zouden volgens Greenpeace moeten worden ontbonden. Opwerking is 
namelijk duur, gevaarlijk en overbodig. Er komt plutonium bij vrij 
dat alleen voor kernbommen geschikt is, het levert een enorme berg 
radioactief afval op -tien tot twintig keer zo veel als bij opslag- 
en maakt transporten van grote hoeveelheden radioactief materiaal 
noodzakelijk. 
<P>
De Franse opwerkingsfabriek Cogéma in La Hague loost meer 
radioactiviteit in het milieu dan alle kerncentrales ter wereld 
samen. Direct opslaan van de gebruikte brandstof bij de Covra is veel 
minder milieuvervuilend en half zo duur. Uit het, op 2 december 
gepresenteerde Greenpeace-rapport 'Het einde van de plutoniumdroom, 
afrekenen met opwerking', blijkt dat opzeggen van het laatste 
opwerkingscontract 284 miljoen gulden oplevert. Dit bedrag is 
gebaseerd op gegevens van Duitse Elektriciteitsbedrijven die staan in 
het rapport van dr. I. Hensing 'an Economic Comparison of Different 
Methods Used by the Nuclear Power Plants'. Greenpeace daagt daarom 
Borssele' eigenaar EPZ (Elektriciteitsmaatschappij Zuid-Nederland) en 
EZ uit openbaar te maken waarom opzeggen onbespreekbaar is.

<IMG SRC="persbergraphics/kopharing.gif"  ALT="Greenpeace voert actie tegen haringvissers in Engelse kanaal."  BORDER=0 WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=109 ALIGN=TOP><BR><BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Visserij in haringbroedplaats volstrekt onverantwoord</FONT></B>
<P>

<B>Actievoerders van Greenpeace hebben vandaag korte tijd in het Engelse 
Kanaal verhinderd dat een
haringtrawler zijn netten binnen haalt. De actievoerders hadden hun 
rubberboot vastgebonden aan de
trawler 'Helen Mary'. De haringstand is op een historisch dieptepunt 
beland. Volgens Greenpeace is
het daarom volstrekt onverantwoord dat juist in een van de 
belangrijkste haringbroedkamers van de
Noordzee wordt gevist.</B><P>

Op dit moment vist een visserijvloot, die voor een groot deel bestaat 
uit Nederlandse schepen, op de
scholen haring die elk jaar rond deze tijd vanuit de Noordzee naar de 
Golf van Dieppe trekken om
te gaan paaien. De grote vriestrawlers en de kleinere schepen willen 
de scholen tijdens deze trek
onderscheppen - de zogenaamde 'Haring-race'. Het gaat de vissers 
hierbij vooral om de eitjes (de kuit)
die in Japan een delicatesse is, en vooral met Nieuwjaar veel wordt 
gegeten. <BR>
De haringen zelf zijn te
mager voor verse consumptie, maar worden wel tot onder meer zure 
haring verwerkt. 
<P>
Op dit moment zijn een tiental trawlers in het Engelse kanaal actief. 
De 'Helen Mary' is een
splinternieuwe trawler van 116 meter lengte, die in het bezit is van 
een Nederlands bedrijf maar vaart
onder Duitse vlag. Het schip is gebouwd met ruim 13 miljoen gulden 
subsidie van de EU en de Duitse
regering, die hiermee feitelijk de overcapaciteit van de 
visserijvloot financieren.<P>


Greenpeace wil dat er onmiddelijk een eind komt aan het bevissen van 
de paaiende Noordzeeharing.
De EU-ministers negeren tot nu toe het strikte advies van 
visserijbiologen van de International
Commission for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) om de paaiende 
haring in het Kanaal niet te
bevissen. De Greenpeace-actie vond plaats vanaf het Greenpeace-schip 
de 'Sirius' die in dit gebied
vaart. De komende dagen zullen de acties worden voortgezet.<P>


Omdat de haringstand met 500.000 ton ver onder de kritische 
ondergrens -het biologische minimum-
van 800.000 ton zit, is afgelopen juli door de Europese Unie een 
noodmaatregel afgekondigd die de
haringquota van dit jaar halveerde. Een maatregel die volgens 
Greenpeace onvoldoende is, aangezien
de EU daarmee slechts streeft naar herstel tot aan het biologische 
minimum. Op dit minimum is de
kans op herstel van het bestand klein. <P>
<B>De situatie is nu 
vergelijkbaar met de jaren zeventig. Ook toen
was de haringstand extreem laag en was een totaal vangstverbod van 
zes jaar noodzakelijk. </B>

<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+3>ADVISEUR RAAD VAN STATE STERKT 
STANDPUNT MILIEUORGANISATIES</FONT></B></PRE>
<P>
Internet-gebruikers sturen protestfaxen naar BF Goodrich
<P>
De Raad van State behandelt vandaag het verzoek van Greenpeace en de 
Waddenvereniging om de verleende milieuvergunningen aan het 
Amerikaanse bedrijf BF Goodrich te schorsen. De adviseur van de Raad 
van State, de Deskundige Beroepen Water, onderschrijft het standpunt 
van de milieuorganisaties dat de lozing van deze nieuwe chloorfabriek 
in strijd is met het Rijks-Waddenzeebeleid en het stand-still-
beginsel.
<P>
Het stand-still-beginsel houdt in dat lozingen van zwarte-lijst 
stoffen, als chloroform, niet mogen toenemen. Door de komst van deze 
nieuwe fabriek aan de rand van de Waddenzee wordt juist het 
tegenovergestelde bereikt: de chloorchemie en daarbij horende giftige 
lozingen nemen alleen maar toe. 
<P>
BF Goodrich wil een CPVC-fabriek (nagechloreerd PVC) bouwen in 
Delfzijl. Lozingen van deze fabriek bevatten uiterst giftige 
chloorstoffen voor mens en milieu. De nieuwe fabriek zal meer 
chloroform (een kankerverwekkende stof) gaan lozen dan de rest van de 
Nederlandse chemische industrie jaarlijks bij elkaar loost. 
<P>
In Duitsland is geschokt gereageerd op de komst van BF Goodrich. Ons 
buurland voelt zich gepasseerd dat het niet gekend is in de nieuwe 
CPVC-vestiging. De toegestane lozing, van een cocktail van giftige 
stoffen in de Waddenzee, schendt het op 22 augustus jl. door 
Duitsland en Nederland ondertekende Milieuprotocol van het Eems-
Dollard Verdrag. Deze lozing staat bovendien haaks op internationaal 
gemaakte afspraken (o.a. Noorzeeministersconferentie, 1995) waarin is 
afgesproken de lozingen van giftige chloorstoffen binnen de tijdsduur 
van een generatie (25 jaar) te beeindigen.Het Wereld Natuur Fonds 
Duitsland heeft, mede namens andere organisaties, gisteren een 
internationale resolutie tegen de nieuwe CPVC-fabriek aan minister 
Jorritsma en Gedeputeerde Staten van Groningen gestuurd.
<P>
Dat niet alleen de milieuorganisaties maar ook burgers zich zorgen 
maken over de komst van de nieuwe CPVC-fabriek blijkt wel uit de 
tientallen faxen die dagelijks bij de hoofddirectie van BF Goodrich 
in Cleveland, Ohio, binnenkomen. Voor het eerst heeft Greenpeace, via 
haar internet web-site, internet-gebruikers opgeroepen hun bezwaren 
tegen de komst van de nieuwe CPVC-fabriek kenbaar te maken. De 
directie van BF Goodrich wordt verzocht te stoppen met de produktie 
en lozing van giftige stoffen en over te schakelen op 
milieuvriendelijke produktieprocessen. 
<P>
Schorsing van de vergunningen door de Raad van State is van groot 
belang. Gebeurt dat niet dan kan de bouw van de CPVC-vestiging 
beginnen voordat de Raad van State over het beroepschrift beslist. 
Greenpeace en de Waddenvereniging vinden dat onaanvaardbaar. Het gaat 
immers om een nieuwe fabriek die giftige chloorstoffen zal gaan lozen 
en dat is in strijd met zowel nationaal als met internationaal beleid.
<P>
Het schorsingsverzoek is mede ondertekend door: Gemeentebestuur van 
Borkum (Duitsland), Stichting Natuur en Milieu, Ecomare, Friese 
Milieu Federatie, Milieufederatie Groningen, Werkgroep Noordzee en 
Milieudefensie.

<IMG SRC="persbergraphics/walvismaan.jpg"ALT="walvis & maan"  WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=200 ALIGN=TOP LOWSRC="http:www.greenpeace.org/~nl/pagegraphics/grijs.gif">

<IMG SRC="persbergraphics/walviswereld.gif"ALT="WALVISWERELD GREENPEACE TENTOONSTELLING BIJ HET SCHEEPVAARTMUSEUM "  WIDTH=232 HEIGHT=94 ALIGN=TOP><P>

<B>Van 6 september tot en met 30 december ligt bij het
Scheepvaartmuseum op pontons, in een tent van bijna 1200 m2 , de
unieke drijvende Greenpeace-tentoonstelling "Walviswereld".</B><P>

Deze bijzondere tentoonstelling is georganiseerd ter gelegenheid van
het 25-jarig bestaan van Greenpeace.Walviswereld is vooral bedoeld
voor kinderen, maar voor hun ouders en andere volwassenen zijn er ook
veel interessante dingen te zien. <BR>
Walviswereld beantwoordt in vier tijdzones (oudheid, begin deze eeuw, begin zeventiger jaren en het
heden) alle vragen over walvissen: wat hebben ze betekend voor de mens
door de eeuwen heen? Hoe werd er vroeger op hen gejaagd? Hoe groot
zijn ze? Hoe was het aan boord van een ouderwetse walvisjager? Wat
zijn baleinen? Waarom voert Greenpeace actie voor de walvissen? <BR>
Er zijn
ondermeer een levensgrote, bewegende potvis en een zogende bultrug op
ware grootte te zien. Op de tentoonstelling lopen voorlichters van
Greenpeace rond om allerlei vragen te beantwoorden.<P>

Naast de walvissen komen ook de andere activiteiten en
aandachtsgebieden van Greenpeace uitgebreid aan bod. Op de
tentoonstelling wordt geprobeerd aan kinderen uit te leggen waarom hun
enthousiasme voor Greenpeace zo belangrijk is en waarom Greenpeace hun
steun zo hard nodig heeft. Het gaat tenslotte om hun toekomst, hun
wereld.<P>

De tentoonstelling is voor een groot deel interactief: er is veel te
zien, te horen, te beklimmen, te voelen en vast te pakken. De
informatiepanelen die bij de tentoonstelling zijn geplaatst (in drie
talen) zijn qua taalgebruik afgestemd op kinderen.<P>

De toegang voor kinderen tot en met 5 jaar is gratis, kinderen tot 12
jaar betalen f10,- en de toegang voor volwassenen bedraagt  f14,-. <BR>
Met
het Toegangsbewijs voor Walviswereld kunnen de bezoekers ook aan boord
 het VOC schip "De Amsterdam". Het Scheepvaartmuseum is niet
bij het kaartje inbegrepen, maar als u de tentoonstelling heeft
bezocht, is het Walviswereld-kaartje goed voor 40% korting op de
toegangsprijs van het Scheepvaartmuseum (dit geldt voor het
standaardtarief). Andersom is het toegangskaartje van het
Scheepvaartmuseum goed voor f2,50 korting bij de Walviswereld.

<P>No one thought that seven people sailing to an island in the U.S.
nuclear test zone could  make a difference. But they did.  They created
so much opposition that one year later the island became a bird
sanctuary, instead of a nuclear test zone, and Greenpeace was born.
<P>For nearly 25 years, Greenpeace has grown into a world wide web of
people actively working  to preserve the global environment.  With the
support of concerned citizens all over the world, we  are fighting
against the over-exploitation of the marine environment, toxic waste,
destruction of  our forests, radioactive waste, global warming, and
ozone depletion.
<P>Across the country and around the world, Greenpeace draws public
attention  to environmental dangers and puts pressure on industry and
government to stop the destruction of  our planet. Whether calling
attention to these injustices through non-violent direct action, public 
education, or grassroots organizing, we need people like you to get
involved. With nearly 3 million supporters in 31 countries,
Greenpeace is creating a global movement that politicians and  corporate
leaders can't ignore.
<CENTER><H2><I>Be a part of this movement for change!</I></H2></CENTER>
<P>Support the Activist Network and be an advocate for the environment.
Work with  Greenpeace to maximize the pressure on the decision-makers
who determine the fate of entire  ecosystems. Acting together, we have
the power to protect the planet and ourselves.
<P>As a member of our Activist Network, you'll be contacted by means of 
<B>"Action Alerts"</B> that  will give you an opportunity to react to the
environment's most  urgent issues.  For example, an <B>"Action 
Alert"</B> might ask you to call your state health authorities and ask them 
<a href="pvcalert.html">take action against lead-containing PVC miniblinds</a> or
contact President Clinton to ask him to favor <a href="current.html">clean paper-making technologies</a>.

<h1>A Dolphin-Safe Label That Really Means It</h1>
<img align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" width="324" height="215" src="pix/tunadolp.gif"
ALT="photo of dolphins surrounded by tuna net"></img>
<p>
Over the past few months, there have been many questions raised
regarding Greenpeace's support for U.S. legislation and
international agreements which address the killing of dolphins in
tuna fisheries.  To set the record straight, there is a definite
number of dolphins Greenpeace believes is acceptable to kill
during tuna fishing: <i>ZERO</i>.  This has been our position for 25
years and remains our position today.
<p> 
We believe that this goal of reducing dolphin deaths related to
tuna fishing to zero can only be achieved through international
cooperation.  One country acting alone cannot save the world's
dolphins, oceans, atmosphere, or forests.  Yet, in the case of
the "tuna-dolphin" issue, as it is known, this is exactly what
the United States has tried to do.  The <b>"Marine Mammal Protection
Act (MMPA) of 1972"</b> was passed by Congress to address the problem
of dolphin kills in the tuna fishery of the Eastern Tropical
Pacific Ocean (ETP).  While tremendous progress has been made,
Greenpeace believes that the only way to eliminate dolphin kills 
is through a strong international commitment by all the countries
fishing for tuna in the region.  
<p> 
In the ETP, Greenpeace supports a new international strategy for
saving dolphins from tuna nets, while ensuring a healthy and
viable tuna fishery for generations to come.  Greenpeace believes
the current U.S. "dolphin-safe" law falls far short of
accomplishing these goals.  Moreover, Greenpeace is concerned
that the public is being lead to believe that all tuna bearing
the "dolphin-safe" label is caught without killing
dolphins, that "dolphin-safe" tuna is environmentally-friendly,
and that the problem of dolphin kills in tuna fisheries has been
solved.  These things are simply not true.  
<p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>  
In the 1950s, a new fishing technology emerged, the purse-seine
net, that enabled ships to fish more intensively and travel
farther out to sea to catch tuna for a growing market. This net 
is deployed around a school of fish and then pulled tight like a 
drawstring on a bag, capturing thousands of pounds of fish at
a time.  Today, more than ninety percent of the world's canned
tuna is caught with this technology.  
<p> 
In 1959, in the ETP, the U.S. tuna fleet found that the largest, 
most valuable tuna swam beneath dolphins.  The U.S. fleet began
the practice of encirclement of dolphins to catch the tuna. By
the early 1960s, U.S. purse-seiners fishing for tuna in the ETP
were killing hundreds of thousands of dolphins annually.        
For decades, Greenpeace has campaigned aggressively on the 
"tuna-dolphin" issue.  Working with other concerned organizations throughout
the 1980s and 1990s, our efforts finally paid off, thrusting the
issue to the forefront of the international environmental agenda.
The U.S. public, the largest consumers of tuna in the world,
began to take notice.  Through citizen action, consumer boycotts,
and other political activities, laws were passed in the United
States to help put a stop to this unnecessary killing.  
<p> 
In 1988, Congress first used economic pressure for dolphin
conservation by adding a new provision to the <b>MMPA</b>, requiring
other fleets in the ETP to kill dolphins at a rate no higher than
the U.S. fleet in order to import tuna into the United States. 
This measure was a complete failure.  Within two years, all other
fishing nations had been embargoed, and dolphin deaths and the
practice of encirclement of dolphins to catch tuna continued.  
<p> 
Criteria for use of the "dolphin-safe" label was enacted by 
Congress as an amendment to the <b>MMPA</b> in 1990.  This legislation
prohibited the practice of encirclement of dolphins in the ETP in
order for that tuna to be labeled as "dolphin-safe."  
<p> 
Another amendment to the <b>MMPA</b> was added in 1992 directing the
United States to negotiate a five-year moratorium on the practice
of encirclement of dolphins with the other countries active in
the ETP.  If the moratorium was not agreed by June 1994, the
United States would ban the sale of non-"dolphin-safe" tuna
within its borders.  
<p> 
But the threat of a closed U.S. market proved unsuccessful, and no 
moratorium was agreed upon.  However, the fishing countries in the
ETP did come together <i>VOLUNTARILY</i> and agree to reduce dolphin
kills on a seven-year schedule.  Under this cooperative 
agreement, dolphin deaths have decreased dramatically, numbering
only 3300 in 1995.    
<p> 
<h3>Is It Really "Dolphin-Safe"?</h3> 
<p> 
The "dolphin-safe" label, by definition, was intended to end the practice of 
encirclement of dolphins to catch tuna.  It has failed to do so.  While the <b>La Jolla 
Agreement</b> has reduced dolphin deaths by more 90 percent since 1990, the "dolphin-safe" 
law has only reduced encirclement by just over 25 percent.  Moreover, this reduction 
in encirclement is attributed to the mass exodus of the U.S. tuna fleet who left the 
ETP to avoid the "dolphin-safe" laws. Unfortunately, other fishing fleets continue 
to encircle dolphins with impunity. 
<p> 
The "dolphin-safe" label we have come to trust has been
manipulated by the Starkist, Bumblebee and Chicken of the Sea
companies into a mere marketing tool to sell more tuna.  The
canners have used the label to imply that all catches are
verified as "dolphin-safe" through an airtight enforcement and
monitoring scheme.  This is far from the truth.  
<p> 
In the ETP, where less than 20 percent of the world's canned tuna is caught,
verification is the tightest, with independent observers on every
boat complemented by dockside observers at the cannery.  For the
rest of the world's canned tuna, the burden of verification rests
solely with dockside monitors who are forced to accept the word
of the skipper as to whether the tuna is "dolphin-safe." 
<p> 
Many of the transnational corporations involved in tuna fishing 
have moved their tuna boats and processing facilities to areas
where there is less regulation than in the ETP.  Most U.S. tuna
boats have been sold to other countries or moved to other regions
to avoid the restrictions of the "dolphin-safe" law and U.S.
legal jurisdiction.  As a result, most of the tuna canning
production has moved from U.S. territories in the South Pacific
to Southeast Asia where monitoring and enforcement of these U.S.-
based policies is almost impossible.   
<p> 
Some vessels fishing for tuna outside of the ETP evade observer
requirements by fishing in another part of the Pacific for most
of their trip, and "topping off" their catch in the ETP on their
way home.  Tuna from that entire trip would then be considered
"dolphin-safe." 
<p> 
In other regions, large tuna transport ships complicate efforts
to track "dolphin-safe" tuna by taking to port the tuna from
several boats from different ocean regions.  Once on land,
determining which tuna is "dolphin-safe" gets even more
complicated as "dolphin-safe" tuna are mixed with loads from
other transport boats. By the time it reaches your grocery store, 
there is little surety that it is actually "dolphin-safe."       
<p>
Finally, it is also important to note that in the ETP and
elsewhere, dolphins have never been the only creatures killed by
vessels purse-seining for mature tuna.  Millions of juvenile
tuna, shark, sea turtles and billfish are taken, with no effort
made to reduce the take or assess the full impact of this bycatch
on the marine environment.  It is clear that even so-called
"dolphin-safe" tuna still causes environmental damage.   
<p> 
<h3>Greenpeace's Solution</h3>
<p>
The "dolphin-safe" label did what was necessary at the time of
its passage:  it brought much needed attention to this issue. But
the current law has gone as far as it can.  However easy or
appealing it may sound to simply shut down the ETP tuna fishery,
this is not a viable option.  Doing so would raise questions of
survival for fishing communities and the need to feed a growing
world population.  Tuna is the leading seafood consumed in the
United States, and a renewable protein source for poor and low-
income persons the world over.
<p> 
There needs to be an international agreement, binding on all
fishing countries through national laws, that will protect not
only dolphins, but other marine species as well as the long-term
sustainability of the tuna stocks.  Resolving these problems in
the ETP would set an important precedent that could lead to
similar agreements for all regions where tuna are caught.    
Therefore, Greenpeace believes the time has come for replacing
unilateral embargoes and the single-country approach with strong
international regulations.  With the leadership of our sister
Greenpeace offices in Latin America -- Mexico, Chile, Brazil,
Guatemala and Argentina --  Greenpeace participated in
discussions with those countries fishing in the ETP, the result
of which was the <a href="#panama"><b>Panama Declaration</b></a>.  
<p> 
The declaration brought all of the countries fishing for tuna in
the ETP to the table, and is a critical first step toward
creating a legally-enforceable international agreement to address
the environmental problems in the ETP tuna fishery.  The 
consensus support for the <a href="#panama"><b>Panama Declaration</b></a> indicated a
strong willingness among the fishing countries to negotiate and adopt an
agreement that would:
<ul> 
<li>Commit all countries fishing for tuna to reduce dolphin deaths 
towards zero;</li>
<li>Be legally binding, and supported by national laws;</li>   
<li>Ensure stronger compliance and enforcement measures rather    
than the current voluntary compliance scheme;</li>
<li>Require mandatory reporting and enforcement measures to be    
shared with all fishing nations;</li>
<li>Protect already depleted dolphin populations;</li>
<li>Ensure healthier marine ecosystems by protecting dolphins as   
well as juvenile tuna and other marine species caught in the   
course of fishing operations;</li>
<li>Provide incentives for fishers who do not kill dolphins; and</li> 
<li>allow the U.S. to impose future trade sanctions on nations failing to 
live up to their commitment to protect dolphins.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Greenpeace's Position On Current Legislation</h3>
<p>
During its final days in October, the 104th Congress failed to take 
final action on <b>H.R.2823/S.1420</b>, <b>"The International Dolphin 
Conservation Act,"</b> legislation that would have fulfilled U.S. 
commitments under the <a href="#panama"><b>Panama Declaration</b></a>. While the House of
Representatives had voted to approve the legislation by a 316-107 margin 
in July, the U.S. Senate was unable to bring it up for a vote prior to
its adjournment.  while it's too early to tell what the prospects are for 
passage in the 105th Congress, Greenpeace will urge the new Congress to
support the legislation  and pass a reintroduced version in early 1997.   
<p>
To accomplish all of this is no small feat.  But, we already have
taken several steps toward what continues to be the only
acceptable number of dolphins which can be killed during tuna
fishing: <i>ZERO</i>.  If we succeed in getting governments and fishing
people around the world to agree to that goal and to keep making
clear progress in that direction, then we will have a package of
environmental protection for dolphins that they can live with, 
regardless of the label.

<font size=+3><b>GREENPEACE RELEASES CONFIDENTIAL FRENCH GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT ON
RADIOACTIVE SHIPMENT ROUTE</b><p></font></center>
<b>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, December 18, 1996</b> -- According to a confidential document
obtained by Greenpeace, the second controversial plutonium waste shipment from Europe to
Japan will leave France on January 16, 1997, on board the U.K.-registered ship <i>Pacific Teal</i>. The
document, released today by Greenpeace, says the ship will travel around the Cape of Good Hope in
South Africa, the east of Australia, and through the South Pacific. The document, the
authenticity of which has not yet been confirmed, also states that en-route governments are to be informed on
December 23 of the intended route of the waste shipment.
<p> 
The same document appears to have been sent by the French Foreign Ministry in
Paris to its embassies in Tokyo, London and Washington, as well as to senior officials in the French
nuclear industry.
<p> 
"If the information in this document is correct, then it highlights the desperation of the governments of
France, Japan and the UK to avoid the strong public and political opposition to nuclear shipments in
the Caribbean, Central and South America," said Tom Clements from on board the vessel <i>M/V
Greenpeace</i>, docked today in San Juan. 
<p> 
Since the beginning of December, Greenpeace has been campaigning in the
Caribbean and Panama Canal to oppose the shipment from using that route. Today the <i>M/V Greenpeace</i>
leaves Puerto Rico for Frederiksted, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The Greenpeace ship <i>Rainbow
Warrior</i> arrived December 16 in the Argentine port of Ushuaia near Cape Horn to protest the
waste shipment.
<p> 
The route given in the French document is the same as the 1992 plutonium
shipment on board the <i>Akatsuki-Maru</i>, which generated widespread opposition among nations along the route.
In 1995, the <i>Pacific Pintail</i>, carrying plutonium waste to Japan, sailed around South America amid
strong condemnation by the governments of Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
<p> 
"All routes for this shipment are unacceptable from an environmental and
security perspective," Clements said.  "Greenpeace will remain in the Caribbean until, and beyond, the
time this deadly shipment sets sail, and we will continue to work with the citizens and
governments of the region to expose and oppose such shipments."

<td valign=top>
In late 1996 or early 1997, a British ship containing highly radioactive nuclear waste is expected to leave the French port of Cherbourg bound for Japan. The secretive transport is the latest chapter in Japan's program to procure tens of tonnes of weapons-usable plutonium. This shipment of glassified, highly radioactive plutonium waste involves tremendous risks to the environment and public health.
<p>
In 1992, after the transport of 1.7 metric tonnes of plutonium onboard the ship <I>Akatsuki Maru</I> caused international condemnation around the globe, Japanese authorities said that they would reconsider the role of plutonium in their energy program. Instead, with the release of a new long-term plan in June of 1994, they rededicated themselves to an ambitious program of plutonium procurement and stockpiling; thereby assuring their status as a world leader in the international trade in weapons-usable plutonium. As part of this misguided and economically unjustifiable nuclear program, Japan, supported by France and Britain, is quietly preparing to make tens of transoceanic transports of irradiated nuclear fuel, nuclear waste and plutonium before the year 2000 alone.
<p>
<img align=right src="pix/plutop1.gif" width=200 height=400 ALT="GP protest of rad waste trasport ship">
The transport of highly radioactive plutonium waste is part of a program to ship more than 3,000 cylindrical glass blocks of some of the most radioactive waste ever produced. In fact, the waste is so deadly that a person within one meter of a single unshielded glass block would receive a fatal dose of radiation in less than one minute.
<p>
The imminent shipment is only the second attempt at moving such deadly material.  The first such transport was made from France to Japan in 1995.  In a desperate effort to evade international attention, that shipment, onboard the British-flagged <I>Pacific Pintail</I>, avoided the Caribbean and Panama Canal and was routed along the South American coast and around Cape Horn.  During its dangerous voyage, the transport was condemned by many nations around the world, and numerous countries put military aircraft in the sky and naval vessels at sea in response to the threat posed by the ship's passage.
<p>
The upcoming shipment will involve the carriage of forty glass blocks which belong to the Tokyo, Kansai, Kyushu and Shikoku electric power companies of Japan.  This cargo will contain some 20,500,000 curies of radioactivity. As British, French and Japanese authorities are keeping the shipment secret, it is not known which ship or route will be chosen.  
<p>
Despite the immense risks involved in moving such dangerous material, there are serious shortcomings in the transport and safety arrangements being made by relevant authorities. These dangers are intensified by apparent cost-cutting measures that have further eroded already inadequate safety provisions. In addition, rather than notifying and involving countries situated along the transports' routes, the Japanese, French and British authorities involved have chosen to act secretively and in arrogant disregard of public will and the authority of other sovereign states.  Altogether, the planned transports are a recipe for disaster which will only be stopped by public opposition and political and legal action.

<img align=left src="pix/plutoqt2.gif" width=121 height=89 ALT="Why Produce and Transport Nuclear Waste?">
The nuclear waste  shipments are the outcome of Japan's ambitious program of plutonium procurement. In order to acquire plutonium, Japan has sent irradiated nuclear fuel from its nuclear power reactors to "reprocessing" plants in France and Britain.  At COGEMA's la Hague (France) and BNFL's Sellafield/THORP (U.K.) reprocessing plants, this irradiated nuclear fuel is chemically dissolved, and plutonium and uranium are removed from the other radioactive waste products formerly contained in the fuel.
<p>
In addition to the separated plutonium and uranium, reprocessing generates a tremendous volume of nuclear waste. A small proportion of this waste from reprocessing is mixed with glass and turned into blocks of highly concentrated radioactive waste. These glass blocks of "plutonium waste" are among the most radioactive materials ever produced. It should be noted that while an estimated 1,280,000 kg of glassified plutonium waste will be transported to Japan in this fashion, this represents only a very small proportion of the overall volume of nuclear waste generated by reprocessing. According to a document leaked to Greenpeace in July 1994, current reprocessing contract negotiations may require only between 3 and 7 percent of the nuclear waste arising from reprocessing to return to the clients. If all the generated nuclear wastes were to be returned to the clients, thousands of additional nuclear transports would be required; for example, British authorities have estimated that the return of clients' waste from the THORP/Sellafield reprocessing site would require more than 19,000 transports.
<p>
A large proportion of the nuclear waste generated by plutonium separation in France and Britain is discharged into the air, ground and sea, creating direct short- and long-term risks to the environment and public health. At the same time, all of the chemicals, equipment and other materials involved in the reprocessing activities themselves become contaminated by the radioactivity released from the reprocessed fuel.  In the end, reprocessing generates a volume of waste as much as 189 times greater than that of the irradiated fuel.
<p>
This nuclear waste generation is a sensitive subject for the plutonium industry and its governmental sponsors.  The terms of the contracts between the reprocessors (Britain and France) and their clients (Japan and others) are kept secret from politicians and the public alike. It is clear that if the public were fully aware of how much waste is dumped or stored in France and Britain, and the quantities which will be returned to Japan and the other client nations throughout Europe, there would be widespread resentment and opposition. By and large, the nuclear industry in Japan and the European client states have been able to dump their nuclear waste in France and Britain, while the plutonium industry in those two countries has aggressively promoted reprocessing as a clean, high-tech enterprise that makes money rather than nuclear waste.
<p>
Nonetheless, resentment and protest in France and Britain have grown, and government and industry have been forced to try and address public concern.  Accordingly, COGEMA and BNFL (the governmentally owned and controlled reprocessing companies in France and Britain respectively) are now planning to return some of the generated nuclear waste to Japan and the European clients. While the material returned may account for as little as 3 percent of the volume of nuclear waste ultimately generated for each client, the planned transboundary movement and return of waste have caused additional protests in the client nations, as well as those along the transport route.

<font size=+3>Genetically Altered Soybeans Threaten U.S. Food Supply</font>
<p>
This fall, U.S. farmers will harvest the first crop of genetically engineered
soybeans. This represents a crucial step in a massive genetic experiment in
which human beings and the environment are guinea pigs.  These soybeans,
developed by Monsanto and known as "Roundup Ready Soybeans" (RRS), may be mixed
with traditional soybeans and sold to both domestic and foreign markets, making
it the first genetically engineered food to be distributed widely.  There is
one -- and only one -- benefit of RRS: it can survive exposure to the herbicide
glyphosate (trade name "Roundup"), allowing farmers to apply it even after the
soybean has started to grow.  This one benefit, however, is outnumbered by
several risks:  to our health, our environment, and our farm economy.
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>Genetically Altered Soybeans</b><p></font>
<p>
Soy is a major staple of the world food supply.  Soybean oil, mulch, and
derivatives (such as lecithin) are used in up to 60 percent of the food products found
on supermarket shelves, as well as being a major component of animal feed.
Roundup Ready is a genetically altered strain of soybean, combining genes from
a virus, a bacteria and a petunia to create a species which is resistant to the
herbicide Roundup.  Monsanto, a St. Louis-based company who also created Agent
Orange and PCBs, holds the patent on RRS, and is the producer of Roundup.  The
patent is in turn licensed to seed companies, such as Pioneer and Asgrow, who
produce and sell the RRS seeds to farmers.
<p> 
Soybeans are America's second largest agricultural crop, accounting for $14
billion in sales each year.  In 1996, 1-2 percent of the U.S. soybean crop was planted
with RRS.  Monsanto projects that 30 percent or more of the U.S. crop will be RRS in
1997.  Monsanto also intends to introduce RRS to farmers in Brazil and
Argentina.
<p> 
The impact of RRS on our health and the environment is not known.  Genetically
engineered plants are living and can breed and even cross-breed, possibly
endangering whole ecosystems.  The hazard of genetic pollution exists
everywhere RRS is grown because of the potential of weeds incorporating the
gene, but the most severe potential impact is in Asia and Australia, where weedy
varieties of soybeans exist.  These strains are the most likely plants to adopt
the Roundup genes, and would do so faster than other plants.  Other vegetation
can also develop a resistance to the herbicide, requiring additional
applications that has potential repercussions on our soil and water.
<p> 
RRS is also a genetic experiment with our bodies.  The potential for allergic
reactions to the virus, bacteria, and/or petunia added to soybeans to make RRS
is unknown because they are all foreign to the human diet.  Since soya is
contained as a sub-component in such a wide variety of foods, it would be very
difficult to trace soya as an allergen.  And, certainly, without labeling of
products containing genetically engineered soybeans, determining food allergies
would be impossible.
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>European Consumer Concern</b><p></font>
Public awareness and concern about genetically engineered food is high in
several European countries.  EuroCommerce, which represents about one third of
European retailers, has already sent a letter to the regional head of the
American Soybean Association in Brussels, demanding segregation of genetically
engineered (GE) and traditional soybeans so that products containing the
experimental beans can be labelled.  Switzerland and Austria are planning
national referenda concerning the growing and use of genetically engineered
crops and food, and on October 8 the Norwegian grocery trade stated that it
would not accept genetically engineered soybeans.  These precautions against
Monsanto's reckless behavior will affect America's soybean exports, and
subsequently American farmers.  
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>American Farmers and Monsanto</b><p></font>
Approximately half of the annual U.S. soybean crop is exported, with more than
one-third of our total crop sent to Europe alone.  In light of the existing
European consumer concern about genetically engineered foods and the growing
reluctance of food companies and retailers to sell RRS, Monsanto is gambling
with the livelihoods of thousands of American farmers in this giant genetic
experiment. 
<p> 
Since RRS is designed to be resistant to Monsanto's own herbicide, the planting
of RRS will guarantee higher profits for Monsanto as farmers who plant the
Monsanto bean will use the Monsanto herbicide.  Due to this experiment with
genetically engineered foods, American farmers stand not only to suffer severe
losses on the European market, but to have Monsanto claim greater control over
their farms. This will make farmers dependent on a single
corporation -- Monsanto -- thus reducing their ability to care for their land and
control their seeds.
<p> 
American farmers have been victimized by Monsanto before. In 1996 another
Monsanto product, genetically engineered cotton, went wrong. The cotton was
supposed to protect itself against caterpillar attack by producing its own
pesticide, but it failed and approximately 20,000 acres of cotton was lost.
There is even a danger that the caterpillars will become resistant to the
pesticide. 
<p> 
Recently, Monsanto genetically engineered "rBGH," a controversial growth hormone
for cows. This is designed to make them produce more milk but can harm the cows
themselves. Farmers and consumer groups in the U.S. have protested against its
use, and the European Union has banned it at least until the year 2000.

Monsanto is engaging in a gigantic genetic experiment with our environment,
health, and economy.  Consumers have the right to know of possible dangers in
our food supply; this includes genetically engineered foodstuffs.  In the case
of RRS, Monsanto is trying to eliminate this right to know by forcing it on the
consumers and contaminating sources of traditional soybeans.

</B><FONT SIZE=3>
 
Lebanon was shaken last October by two waste trade
scandals. Greenpeace has helped uncover the case of 36
containers full of plastic wastes from Germany.  Shortly
afterwards, the authorities on Beirut port confiscated 2
containers full of plastic waste from Belgium.
 
<B>1. WASTE FROM GERMANY:</B>
 
The Greenpeace Mediterranean Office has been pressing
Germany to take back from Lebanon all the 36 containers
filled  with a mixture of plastic wastes.  No distinction
should be made between contaminated and not contaminated
waste.
 
Last November, three German experts inspected the
containers at Beirut Port.  Lebanese officials and
Greenpeace were present at the site and documented the
inspection. The experts will write a report and then the
German authorities are expected to say next January that
they will return all the waste.
 
Until today, German officials have refused to clearly
state that they would return all the waste and insinuated
that they might return only the contaminated wastes. This
is unacceptable and outrageous.  Germany has no excuse.
It cannot hide behind anything because German and
European Union (EU) laws were broken when the 36
containers were sent to Lebanon last July. Germany has a
legal and moral obligation to agree to take back this
waste just like it did last month with 380 tons of
industrial chemical German waste in Hungary.
 
A Greenpeace expertise, published recently, proved that
the export from Germany to Lebanon of 36 containers with
plastic wastes is an illegal operation under German and
EU laws. Treatment of waste inside Germany is the first
option of waste disposal under Article 3 of the German
law on shipments of waste. The second priority is
treatment in another EU country.  Disposal outside the EU
can only be the last option when treatment inside Germany
or the EU is impossible. 21 containers are clearly
hazardous waste under the German legislation. This means
that their export to Lebanon is illegal under article
1.1b of the Basel Convention," the expertise said.
 
Due to strong indications that the German waste was
shipped to Lebanon for final disposal, "this waste export
is prohibited by the EU Council regulation on the
supervision and control of shipments of waste (EEC Nr.
259/93, Article 14).   Even if the wastes shipped to
Beirut would be considered as wastes for recovery, they
would by no means fall into the Green List of Wastes
(Annex II to EEC 259/93) because of their contamination,"
the expertise added.
 
Greenpeace has provided copies of the expertise to the
Lebanese judicial authorities and to the Environment
Ministry to support them in their work to return the
wastes to Germany. We also gave copies to the German
authorities in Bonn and Baden-Wuerttemberg and to the
German embassy in Beirut.  Greenpeace has been in regular
contact with the authorities in Bonn and in Stuttgart,

the capital of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg from which
the waste originated.
 
<B>2. BACKGROUND WASTE FROM GERMANY:</B>
 
A Lebanese Environment Ministry report and a French
expertise proved that the 36 containers are full of
unsorted plastic waste, including PVC plastics, that
cannot be recycled in Lebanon. There are no facilities in
Lebanon to deal with such wastes because some of it is
contaminated with chemicals like pesticides and
fertilisers, said the Lebanese and French report. Some
waste is from hospitals and biologically contaminated.
The shipment was sent to Lebanon via Rotterdam last July.
It was declared as plastic raw material for the
industrial production. The Lebanese company "George
Freiha and Sons" was to buy it but on 8th August the
company rejected the material when it realised that it
was useless waste.
 
Greenpeace has learnt that Bernd Bretzing, the director
of RC-GMBH Reifenrecycling, was in 1993 the director of
the German company Asian Trade Import Export. This
company was responsible for dumping in the Baltic state
Estonia 6,000 tons of used tires from Germany in the
early 1990s. They were burnt illegally and emitted
poisonous smoke.  Bretzing was jailed on remand in
Germany last August under suspicion of illegally storing
hazardous waste.
 
<B>3. WASTE FROM BELGIUM:</B>
 
Lebanese authorities demanded last November that Belgium
returns 2 containers full of mixed plastic wastes, some
of it contaminated with chemicals. The 2 containers
arrived in Beirut Port on 24 October and were confiscated
shortly afterwards.
 
A Lebanese factory called Saltex imported the 2
containers. It is owned  by a man called Jean Salakhian.
He got the waste through a Lebanese businessman in
France, Nabil Kassir. Salakhian paid for the 2 containers
20,000 French Francs. When the shipment arrived at Beirut
Port, the importer claimed that he refused it because of
the horrible smells. The shipment was declared as plastic
bags and used plastic bags.
 
Lebanese authorities, already alarmed at that time by the
issue of German plastic waste, confiscated the 2
containers. The environment ministry sent experts to
inspect the waste. They wrote 2 reports saying that the
waste from Belgium is contaminated with pharmaceutical
chemical substances like "Eugenol", "Phnyliques" and
"Amidiques". They concluded: "These wastes were meant for
final disposal and
cannot be recycled in Lebanon." The numbers of the 2
containers are: TRIU539192/9  and TRIU525857/8.
Authorities in Lebanon have arrested Jean Salakhian.
 
<B>4. EVALUATION OF THE TOXIC TRADE CAMPAIGN:</B>
 
In a preliminary evaluation of the toxic trade campaign
in Lebanon one can say that two years of work on this
issue led to a strong awareness among Lebanese officials
and the people. Deputies and the new Environment Minister
Akram Shuhayeb took our ideas about a new legislation to
ban the import of all wastes even under the disguise of
recycling.
 
I gave the head of the Parliamentary Committee on the
Environment, Elie Skaff, and Mr. Shuhayeb documents to
help them draft a law banning the import of all sorts of
wastes - even under the disguise of recovery or
recycling. Lebanon may become
next year the first Arab state to pass a stiff anti-waste
trade law.
 
Greenpeace supports the position of the Lebanese
government and the judiciary who asked Germany to return
all the waste and make no exceptions.  Greenpeace
reiterates its call to the Beirut government to sign the
Waste Trade Protocol of the Barcelona Convention, that
was signed in Izmir last October, and the 1995 Basel Ban
amendment to protect itself from toxic and nuclear waste
attacks.
 
The export of all sorts of wastes from industrialised
nations to developing ones - even for so-called recovery
or recycling - should be banned. Waste is waste and
should stay where it was produced. As a matter of
principle, clean production methods should be introduced
in all industrial processes so that no hazardous or toxic
waste is produced in the first place.

Report From The Second Diplomatic
Conference On Fisheries Management
In The Mediterranean
</B><FONT SIZE=3>
Venice, 27-29 November 1996.
 
This second EU sponsored conference has shown an
improvement from the previous one which was held in Crete
two years ago.  Almost all the countries which made
interventions recognised the need to take measures
towards the conservation and sustainable exploitation on
marine resources in the Mediterranean.
 
The Commission's position (Emma Bonino) was clear and
strong: it is necessary to reduce fleets in the Mediterranean
and change the current path of lack of action. She openly 
referred to the need to implement the UN Treaty and the FAO
Code as well as that the EU must become a GFCM Member Party
as soon as possible.
 
The main concrete conclusion of the conference is the
creation of a working party of legal and technical experts to
develop a system of conservation and management harmonised at
Mediterranean level.  This working party will be mandated
to provide the States'contribution to the 22 Session of
the GFCM.  It will prepare practical proposals and submit
them in time for the next session of the GFCM to be held
in Morocco in October 1997.
 
On the specific driftnet issue, the Italian Minister
defended a total driftnet ban in the Mediterranean, giving
assurances that his country will implement the reconversion 
plan in order to eliminate the Italian Drift-net fleet.

European Union Bans Hazardous Waste Trade
</B><FONT SIZE=3> 
Brussels, December 10.

European Union (EU) followed through its commitments with the 
United Nations Basel Convention to prohibit hazardous wastes 
exports to non-OECD countries.

At yesterday's Council meeting, EU environment ministers
from all 15 member states reached political agreement to 
amend EU legislation so that shipments of hazardous waste for 
recycling and recovery to all non-OECD countries have to end 
by December 31, 1997 (1).
 
This will close the recycling loophole through which most
hazardous waste exports are currently flowing. While EU-
exports of waste for final disposal are prohibited since 
1993, shipments of wastes for recovery, no matter how
hazardous, are still allowed.  Following yesterday's decision
for the legal amendment, and beginning in 1998, hazardous 
waste traders in the EU will no longer be able to justify 
their dirty business with sham or dirty recycling operations 
in non-OECD countries.
 
"The transposition of the Basel Ban into EU law is a
great step forward to the detoxification of our planet", 
said Axel Singhofen, Greenpeace International EU Toxics 
Advisor.  "The hazardous waste export ban will force the 
rich EU countries to minimize hazardous waste generation at 
the source and spare the less industrialized world from 
their toxic effluent," added Singhofen.
 
The ministerial decision made it very clear that the EU
ban is a no-exception ban, since no kind of circumventing
trade agreement will be possible after 31 December 1997, and
all existing trade agreements will end by that date (2).
 
As one of the biggest steps towards clean production
since Rio, the European Community has now taken the global
lead in establishing that all hazardous waste exports to 
non-OECD countries, due to the immanent threat to health and
environment, are criminal.  Following the example of the
EU, it is now up to the rest of the world, in particular to 
the remaining OECD-countries, to transpose into legislation
their commitment under the Basel Convention to ban all OECD -
non-OECD hazardous waste trade.

<B>NOTES FOR THE EDITOR:</B>
(1) The EU is a contracting party to the Basel Convention
on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and their Disposal.  In March 1994, the contracting 
parties to the Basel Convention decided (Decision II/12) to 
immediately ban all hazardous waste exports from OECD to 
non-OECD countries for final disposal, and as of January 1, 
1998, all hazardous wastes destined for recovery. In April 
1995, Environment Commissioner Bjerregaard took the 
initiative to amend the existing EC Regulation on waste 
shipments (EEC/259/93) accordingly.
 
(2) see amended text of Regulation EEC/259/93, Article 16
(1): "All exports for recovery of waste listed in Annex V
shall be prohibited except those to: (a) countries to which
the OECD Decision applies; (b) other countries: [..] Any 
such exports shall however be prohibited from 1 January 
1998 onwards."

<FONT SIZE=5><B>Issue #1: INCINERATION</B><FONT SIZE=3>
</A>
<IMG SRC="pics/img0051.jpg" ALT="[Incinerator]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="bottom"></A>

On July 10th 1996, the Greenpeace Mediterranean Office held 
a press conference on incineration in Malta during which it 
presented a report entitled "The Burning Truth".  The 
conference was held jointly with Moviment Ghall-Ambjent, 
Friends of the Earth (Malta).  This report said that 
incinerators and landfills are being proposed in Malta, 
Lebanon, Turkey, Israel and other states as the 
environmentally acceptable solution to the current waste 
crisis.  But Greenpeace explained that  this is nothing but 
a myth.  Waste incineration is actually a seriously 
polluting technology.

The embedding of waste incineration and landfilling in 
southern Mediterranean states would ensure a waste-
generating industrial infrastructure, encourage waste trade 
and divert capital from waste prevention and recycling 
activities.  This would also postpone the introduction of 
Clean Production policies in industrial processes and hinder 
a sustainable future.  Under the guise of "transfer of 
environmentally sound technology for sustainable 
development", the West`s hazardous  and unwanted 
technologies are now being exported to Malta, Lebanon, 
Turkey, and other southern Mediterranean states.

Source reduction, reuse, recycling and composting of 
household waste is the only way to solve the growth waste 
crisis in the southern and eastern Mediterranean.  
Therefore, Greenpeace calls for:

1.  An immediate ban on burning waste containing chlorinated 
compounds and heavy metals.
2.  Plans to phaseout existing incinerators.
3.  A halt in construction of new incinerators and in the 
expansion of existing ones.
4.  A ban on dumping all sorts of hazardous waste in 
landfillls.
5.  Formulating and implementing programs for waste 
prevention, reuse, recycling and composting of household 
waste.  Financial incentives for communities to institute 
programs for source reduction, reuse, recycling and 
composting of solid household and urban waste.
6.  Formulating and implementing large-scale Clean 
Production programs in the industry.  Financial incentives 
to promote the introduction of clean production and not end-
of-pipe technologies.

In Israel, authorities want to incinerate waste from  Ramat 
Hovav, Israel’s hazardous waste disposal site.  Some 45,000 
tons of  waste are stored on the site.  The planned 
incinerator is to burn toxic as well as sewage sludge, used 
oils, solvents, pesticides, waste rich with heavy metals, 
PVC and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  The toxic ash is 
to be landfilled in the Negev.

Authorities are planning to build the country`s first 
household waste incinerator in Hadera, south of Haifa.  
Plans exist for a landfill for municipal waste in the Negev.


<A HREF="lebanon.html"><IMG SRC="pics/lebanst.gif" ALT="[Lebanon]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="bottom"></A><P>

The Lebanese Environment Ministry and the Council for the 
Development and Reconstruction (CDR) have formulated waste 
management plans relying solely on incinerators and 
landfills.  On December 5, 1996, the Lebanese Parliamentary 
Committee on Agriculture and Environment made a tragic 
mistake when it allowed the government to seek 110 million 
dollars of foreign loans to set up several incinerators and 
waste landfills in the country.

The agreement between the Lebanese government and the 
International Bank for Development and Reconstruction 
envisages getting a loan of 55 million dollars.  The 
remaining 55 million dollars are to come from Japan.  The 
money is to be used to set up 15 landfills, modernise and 
rehabilitate the existing landfills, set up two new 
composting plants in the cities of Saida and Zahle, 
modernise the incinerator in Amrusieh south of Beirut and 
set up there a composting plant, and construct a new 
incinerator for hospital waste.  The agreement does not even 
mention the ideas of "waste prevention and reduction" or 
"Clean Production".  Greenpeace has learnt that the toxic 
ash of the Amrusieh incinerator in southern Beirut is being 
dumped in the Borj-Hammud landfill.  They were part of 
15,800 barrels of toxic waste were dumped in 1987/88.  They 
were part of 15,800 barrels and 20 containers of toxic waste 
imported illegally from Italy in 1987.


<A HREF="turkey.html"><IMG SRC="pics/turkeyst.gif" ALT="[Turkey]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="bottom"></A><P>

In Turkey, a hospital and hazardous  waste incinerator is 
being constructed in Izmit, and  is expected to  be 
operational next September.  The  city is a centre of the 
country`s  heavy industry.  The city is a centre of the 
country`s heavy industry.  The incinerator is expected to 
burn 2600kg of solid waste per hour and 1.400 kg of waste 
water per hour.  There is also an industrial and household 
landfill in Izmit with a surface of 800.000 m2.  Authorities 
constructed an incinerator for hospital waste in Istanbul.  
Recently, after a short period of operation, the plant was 
closed for "technical modifications".  Its furnace has a 
capacity of 1000 kg per hour.


<A HREF="malta.html"><IMG SRC="pics/host2.gif" ALT="[Head Office (Malta)]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="bottom"></A><P>

In Malta, a 1992 official report estimated the waste 
problems to be:

*domestic solid waste: 97.200 tonnes per year in 1992 
increasing to 126,400 tonnes by the year 2010
*industrial solid waste: 90,000 tonnes per year in 1992 
increasing to 100,000 tonnes by the year 20110

Malta`s Environment Secretariat  is reported to be seriously 
considering the Incinerator option. This would be a tragic 
decision.  Authorities are looking for a short term, quick 
solution to the waste problem, when they should rather 
formulate and implement long-term Clean Production, waste 
reduction and recycling policies, a process requiring 
dedication and patience.

The Israeli environment ministry and Haifa Chemicals 
recently agreed to solve the company`s waste problem on 
land.  This was possible after Greenpeace torpedoed plans of 
Haifa Chemicals to build a pipe to discharge toxic effluents 
directly into the sea.  The company is now discharging its 
toxic sludge into the Kishon River, and its ship the 
"Aribel" regularly dumps highly toxic sludge into the 
Mediterranean.  The accord has loopholes: It allows the 
factory discharge into the Kishon for the coming 4.5 to 6 
years.  Haifa Chemicals then celebrated the "year of 
environment" to greenwash its image.

<B>SHELL</B>  <IMG SRC="pics/img0022a.jpg" ALT="[Shell]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="absmiddle"></A>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Shell has been systematically polluting an aquifer in 
southeast Turkey.  To escape possible liabilities, it sold 
the oil to Perenco that is continuing the criminal practice.

Pumping polluted water into the aquifer must stop at once.  
This practice will effect the lives of future generations in 
and around Diyarbakir.  Shell must accept permanent 
responsibility for the legacy it left.  The double standards 
and non-existent ethics of Shell are now clear to everybody.  
Shell and Perenco are just keen to make money at the expense 
of the environment and the people of Turkey.  The 
Dutch/British company Shell would have never injected 
polluted water into the aquifers in Britain or the 
Netherlands.  

<IMG SRC="pics/img0023.jpg" ALT="[Midyat/Diyarbakir Aquifer]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="bottom"></A>

In a related development, Turkey narrowly escaped from a 
disaster when one of Perenco`s oil pipelines transporting 
crude oil to nearby tanks exploded north of Diryarbakir last 
July.  The blast ignited a fire that Perenco could not 
extinguish.  It called the army that was able to stop the 
fire from reaching huge oil tanks.  Greenpeace contacted 
Perenco, but it refused to give any information.  Perenco`s 
main business strategy has been to buy unprofitable oil 
fields and drilling assests from at a profit after cutting 
staff and operating costs to a minimum.

The pipelines of Perenco are falling apart and maintenance 
work is almost non-existent to save costs.  Greenpeace 
demands that Turkish authorities force Perenco to repair and 
maintain its facilities to achieve the best possible safety 
standards.  The company must stop injecting production water 
polluted with chemicals and oils into the Midyat aquifer.

<B>OFFICIALS LIED OVER IMPACT OF CHERNOBYL
IN TURKEY</B>
<FONT SIZE=3>
When the Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded in 1986, Turkish 
politicians claimed that the impact on their country was 
null. The Reality is different: People consumed contaminated 
food. Ten years after the disaster, the same officials are 
now promoting plans for a nuclear power plant in Turkey.
 

Turkish authorities have lied to their people about the 
impact of the Chernobyl disaster. The disinformation policy 
has been going on since the nuclear power plant exploded in 
the Ukraine on April 26, 1986.  This resulted in tons of 
contaminated food being consumed by millions of people. Last 
April Greenpeace published a report on this issue and on the 
tenth anniversary of the nuclear disaster.  The report 
included confidential memos from Turkish officials and the 
few credible Turkish scientific studies on the impact of 
Chernobyl in Turkey.
 
Turkish ministers and other officials forbade scientists to 
carry out independent studies, allowed only a handful of 
politicians to make public statements on the issue and 
allowed contaminated food to be sold. In Turkey, the sale 
and export of contaminated tea and hazelnuts, and not public 
health, was the main concern of authorities. This means that 
radiated food will effect people for many years to come.

<IMG SRC="pics/ch06.jpg" ALT="[Child]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="bottom"></A>
 
The Turkish Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK) knew about the 
contamination in regions like the Black Sea. But it neither 
warned farmers growing tea in this region nor factories 
processing it. Contaminated tea was sold on the Turkish 
market.  Best quality tea was sold most likely in Germany 
and consumed by Turkish workers living there. Results of 
measurements in Germany of tea bought in
Turkey in June 1987 varied from dangerous levels of 6,000 to 
30,000 Bq/kg.
 
Cahit Aral, Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade, bluntly 
said in June 1986:  "All meat, milk, water, fish, vegetables 
from all over our country are totally clean. There is no 
radioactive contamination harming human health." But he 
confessed in 1992: "The government has indeed hidden the 
facts and figures on the impact of Chernobyl in Turkey." He 
justified this policy with the following argument: "We did 
take our revenge on the Soviet Union for the nightmare of 
Chernobyl by exporting contaminated hazelnuts to Russia." 
Mr. Aral confirmed that the same hazelnuts were given  for 
free to Turkish soldiers. Hazelnuts were also distributed in 
primary schools. 
 
Mr. Ozemre, former head of TAEK, Mr. Aral and other 
officials had tried to suppress information about the 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.  Today thay are 
promotin nuclear power  with the support of the current 
coalition government.  Officials recently said that the 
tender for the construction of a nuclear power plant in 
Akkuyu near Mersin would start soon.
 
Greenpeace demands that Turkish authorities allow intensive 
and independent scientific research on the impact of 
Chernobyl in Turkey.  The full consequences on people`s  
health and on the environment must be assessed.  All 
information on this issue should be made public.  And all 
nuclear plans should be scrapped once and forever.

<B>THE MUGLA TRIANGLE WILL STOP DESTROYING LIVES
AND THE ENVIRONMENT</B>
<FONT SIZE=3>
On June 20th, 1996 the Aydin Administrative Court, accepted 
the demand to stop the Gokova, Yenikoy and Yatagan Coal 
Power Plants due to the damage they inflict on human health 
and the environment.  The cases for Gokova and Yatagan was 
started in 1993 and Yenikoy in 1994 by The Izmir 
Environmental Movement Lawyers.

The lawyers first applied to the Prime Ministry, and the 
Ministry of Energy for the closure of these power plants 
stating that their operation violate the laws and cause 
environmental damage.  Then they sued The Ministries of 
Energy and Health, Mugla Governor’s Office and the Turkish 
utility TEK at the Aydin Administrative court.

Turkey is an extremely energy wasteful country and therefore 
has a great potential in energy efficiency.  Unfortunately, 
energy efficiency is not taken seriously by the Ministry of 
Energy which is busy with dangerous nuclear investments.  
Also, the power lost in transmission and distribution in 
Turkey amounts to a huge 25 percentage.  Turkey could easily 
keep Yatagan, Yenikoy and Gokova closed and forget its 
nuclear plans if it invested in energy efficiency and its 
clean, inexpensive and safe renewable energy sources now.  
Renewables not only contribute to a cleaner environment, but 
also help with creating more jobs than the polluting thermal 
and nuclear power plants.

Greenpeace demands that the decision of The Aydin 
Administrative Court is implemented immediately and the 
nuclear tender to be cancelled.  This is the only way to a 
safe and secure energy future where efficiency and 
renewables are the true solution.

Hotels".  This company is owned by Mr. Michaelides.

To raise the pressure against Mr. Michaelides,  Greenpeace

The demonstrators carried sandwich boards with a caricature

<B>FRANCE WANTS TO EXPORT NUCLEAR WASTE</B>
<FONT SIZE=3>
France has been blocking and agreement on a protocol banning 
the export of toxic and nuclear waste from northern to 
southern Mediterranean countries.  Dring recent negotiation 
rounds, France has filed a "reserve" on the inclusion of 
radioactive waste in the export ban to non-European Union 
countries in the basin.  France agreed to ban nuclear waste 
exports to 66 developing countries in Asia, the Pacific and 
Latin America, but it refuses to apply the same policy in 
the Mediterranean.  Greenpeace demands that France signs the 
protocol during a meeting in Turkey this September.

<B>SOLAR ENERGY IS MARKETABLE</B><IMG SRC="pics/fluorblb.gif" ALT="[Fluorescent Bulb]" BORDER="none" ALIGN="absmiddle"></A>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Athens - Greenpeace exchanged last April normal lamps in the 
Greek Ministry of Energy with energy-efficient ones.  The 
"high-tech" bulbs consume only a fifth of the energy and 
last ten times longer than the normal ones.  The action 
meant that the ministry would save about 20,000 kilowatt-
hours, or $2,500, per year.  Greenpeace wants authorities in 
the Mediterranean to subsidise energy-efficient technologies 
and provide incentives to alternative energies like solar 
and wind.

In Germany, Greenpeace proved last spring that rooftop 
photovoltaic units are now 40 percent cheaper than before.  
Five firms submitted to us bids saying they can offer 2-
kilowatt rooftop solar facilities fulfilling specific 
technical and cost criteria.  Greenpeace then collected from 
4,000 people intents of purchase for such a facility.  If 
all these people install a solar rooftop unit, this would 
double present solar power use in Germany.

<center>
<h2>ROEKKE AND RGI </h2>
 

<table width=80% cellpadding=7>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>
<p>RGI head, Kjell Inge Roekke, and his partner Bjoern Rune
Gjelsten, have built up the most powerful private fishery empire
ever, controlling about 10% of the global Whitefish resource. 
When he founded American Seafoods Co. (ASC) in 1987, nobody took
notice, for it was merely one of a host of fishing companies
which got its start in Seattle in the factory trawler boom of the
late 1980s. But Roekke kept buying boats, and in a few short
years ASC has risen to the top while many of its rivals went
bankrupt.

<p>Today, Roekke's companies operate fishing vessels in Alaska,
Russia, Argentina and South Africa, often dominating the other
players: in Alaska, they control 37% of the offshore pollack
quota. Not surprisingly, Roekke is widely regarded as the most
powerful man in international fisheries.
 </td><td width=50% valign=top> 
<p>Although it got its start in Seattle, there is nothing
"home-grown" about American Seafoods. Vessels based there have
fished from the Bering Sea to the Antarctic, and it could be said
that these ocean nomads have no home port: owned by a Norwegian
holding company, managed by a Seattle-based subsidiary, crewed
by citizens of many nations, purchasing licences and reflagging
in whichever country is most convenient at the moment.
</tr></table> 


<p><b><h3>THE MODERN FISHING REALITY</h3></b>
 
<table width=80% cellpadding=7>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>
<p>Companies such as American Seafoods and its parent, RGI, have
transformed the fishing trade into a globalised extraction
industry dominated by multinational corporations which operate
using industrial economies of scale. 
 
<p>Today, fish and fish products such as surimi and fishmeal are
sold to the highest bidder. The sad reality is that farmers or
producers in the industrialised countries can pay far higher
prices for fishmeal than the local communities in developing
countries can pay for fresh fish. Thus, these communities are
exploited twice: the fish stocks are depleted by these distant
water fishing fleets, and the catch disappears to other
countries, so valuable protein sources are lost. 
 </td><td width=50% valign=top>
<p>With bases on four continents and a global infrastructure to
market the catch, RGI and its subsidiaries are well-positioned
to cash in on whatever fish resources are available around the

world. 
 
<p>Now, Roekke plans to send the American Monarch, the world's
largest surimi supertrawler, to fish off the coast of Chile; for
very good reasons, the local Chilean fishermen are saying "NO".
</table>
 
<p><b><h3>RGI IN LATIN AMERICA</h3><b>
 <table width=80% cellpadding=7>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>

<p>RGI is planning on sending the American Monarch to fish primarily
for southern blue whiting, but also hoki (Patagonian grenadier),
in the waters of southern Chile. They claim that the addition of
this vessel will not affect local fisheries, as the stocks of
these two species are abundant and there are no ecological links
between them and the stocks fished by artisanal Chilean
fishermen. Greenpeace does not accept these claims.
 
<p>First, the abundance of the stocks. A research fishery conducted
by another RGI vessel, the American Dynasty, produced an estimate
of 170,000 tonnes for the stock of southern blue whiting. RGI
doubles this figure to 340,000 tonnes, claiming that the lower
figure represents only adult biomass, to which must be added an
estimate for the juveniles. They provide no justification for
simply doubling the adult biomass, and the Norwegian Institute
of Marine Research biologists have said that a ratio of 1:1 is
probably too high and would not be used in Norway.

<p>To the estimate of 340,000 tonnes of whiting, RGI adds an
estimate of 760.000 tonnes for the biomass of hoki, for a total
estimate of 1.1 million tonnes of exploitable biomass. Yet the
preliminary fishing of the American Dynasty for southern blue
whiting included only 1.12% of hoki in the catch. In fact, while
hoki is a bottom species, whiting lives further up in the water
column, so the simple addition of the estimates for these species
is dubious at best. It seems that, as is frequently the case,
"optimistic" estimates of total stock abundance are used to
justify addition of vessels to a fishery.


<p>Southern hake is the most important species for local Chilean
fishermen, and RGI has stated that, not only will the American
Monarch not fish for this species (though it is included in their
licence), but there is no ecological link between hake and either
southern blue whiting or hoki. The latter is a strange claim,
since the results of the American Dynasty noted that 30% of the
stomach contents of southern hake consisted of southern blue
whiting. There is thus a significant and direct link between the
principle target species of the American Monarch and the most
important species for Chilean fishermen.
 </td>
<td width=50% valign=top> 
 
<p>A report by the Chilean Central Bank has stated that the stock
of southern hake has been reduced by 85% since 1985, from 575,000
tonnes to 85,000 tonnes in 1993. If one of the most important
prey species of hake, southern blue whiting, is now put under
intense fishing pressure by the American Monarch, any recovery
of the hake stock could be adversely affected, possibly even
prevented.

<p>"Intense" is the most appropriate word to describe the fishing
capability of the American Monarch.  The opening of the trawl it
will use measures 124 metres by 124 metres. The American Dynasty,
using a trawl with an opening less than half that of the American
Monarch, averaged a catch rate of 38 tonnes an hour. Simple
arithmetic suggests that the American Monarch could catch the
entire adult biomass of southern blue whiting in less than one
year.  The RGI vessel will not be alone, though, as there is
already another vessel in the fishery catching 30,000 tonnes per
year.

<p>RGI had said that the American Monarch would provide jobs for 500
Chileans, though this figure was later modified to 240.  The
Chilean coastal fishing association, CONAPACH, is worried that
if this vessel enters the southern blue whiting fishery off
Chile, it will end up putting 6,000 people out of work in the
areas of Aysen and Magellan.
 
<p>The chairman of CONAPACH said in an interview during his visit
to Norway in June 1996: "We fear that the American Monarch will
sweep up all the fish that is available off Chile, and then move
on to other places to fish."  The Chilean fishermen have good
reason to be worried about the RGI vessel.
 
<p>RGI has claimed publicly that their activities in Chile will pose
no threat to local fish stocks or fishing communities and that
they are truly interested in sustainable fisheries. If they are
sincere in these claims, the company should make one decision and
one decision only: to withdraw their plans to send the American
Monarch to Chile. On the other hand, it is difficult to see what
other fishing grounds provide viable options for this ship; it
is an open question whether or not there is a future for such
technology, but all signs suggest that there is not.

<p><h3>RGI/AMERICAN SEAFOODS CO. AND "AMERICAN MONARCH": 
MAKING SURIMI OUT OF SOUTHERN MARINE BIODIVERSITY.</h3>
<tr><td width=50% valign=top>
<p>The Southeast Pacific is one of the most productive marine
ecosystems, characterized by the high variability in its
oceanographic conditions. In this area you find Chile and Peru,
representing the second and third most important fishing
countries worldwide, with  approximatelly  20% of the world fish
captures annually. 
 
<p>The Chilean marine production has grown from 900.000 tons in
1975 to 7,6 millions tons in 1994. Between 1986 and 1994, the
export of fisheries products grew by a 100%.  In 1995,
fisheries represented Chile's third largest export income, after
mining and forestry. At the present, fisheries and aquaculture
brings in US$ 1.700 millions annually,  representing 12% of 
total annual Chilean export value.
</td><td width=50% valign=top>
 
<p>Chilean fishery is oriented mainly around intensive captures of
small pelagic species. Presently the captures are mainly taken 
between the northern  and central-southern  areas, in total  36
pelagic species used for fish meal and fish oil production. But
only 4 of these species represents  90% of the total Chilean
fish capture: Jack Mackerel (Trachurus murphyii), - representing
60% of the total Chilean fish capture annually, Anchoveta
(Engraulis ringens), Horse Mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and
Sardine (Sardinox sagax). Both Jack Mackerel and Anchoveta, 
representing some 87% of the total Chilean fish captures, are
straddling stocks (Zuleta y Oliva,1995).

<p><b><h3>THE CHILEAN DEMERSAL FISHERY</b></h3>
<table width=80% cellpadding=7> 
<tr><td width=50% valign=top>
<p>In the southern regions of Chiloe, Aysen and Magellan, besides
Antartic waters under CCAMLR administration, the chilean
demersal fishery is located between the 41 and 57 southern
latitude.
 
<p>This fishery represent approximatelly  10% of the total
captures, but added to aquaculture, it represents 75% of  total
value of Chilean fishery.
 
 
<p>In this remote area, the southern Chilean demersal fishery is
sustained by several species that interact  trophically. The
main target of  this fishery is, however, the Patagonian hake
, (Merluccius australis). This species is a top predator in the
demersal community, consuming principally Patagonian grenadier
or Hoki   (Macrouronus magallanicus)  and Southern Blue Whiting
(Micromesistius australis)  (Ojeda,1981).
 
<p>Another important demersal species is the overexploited Cusk Eel 
(Genypterus blacodes) and the Chilean Seabass or Patagonian
Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides).
 
</td><td width=50% valign=top> 
<p>Patagonian Hake, Patagonian Grenadier  and  Southern Blue
Whiting are all  straddling stocks, with a distribution around
the southern cone of Latin America and subantartic waters.They 
are captured mainly by factory and freezer trawlers, most of
these with  EU and Asian investors. 
 
<p>Blue Whiting has been a regular by-catch in the Patagonian Hake
fishery. Patagonian Grenadier were taken as by-catch too, but
decreasing abundance of Patagonian Hake  in 1990, made
Patagonian Toothfish and  Patagonian Grenadier the target
resources.  
 
<p>Approximately 1.500 artisanal fishermen, catch the Patagonian
Hake from the internal channels and fjords of  Chiloe, Aysen and
Magellan regions, many of  them  under extremely poor economical
and social conditions. Complementary, the industrial fleet under
Chilean flag, is compsed mainly by old Spanish, South Korean and
Japanese vessels, exported due to overcapacity in these
countries.

<p>Patagonian  Toothfish is an demersal straddling stock, with 
distribution in the Economics Exclusive Zones of  Southern Cone
coastal countries (EEZs),  Antartic sector under <a href="#CCAMLR">CCAMLR</a>
administration  and international  waters. It is captured mainly 
by factory and  freezer longliners owned by EU, Asian  and
Chilean investment companies .
 
<p>In the sub antarctics waters - mainly South Georgias/ Shag Rocks
area, Sandwich and Orcadas islands and EEZs - there has been
during past two years, reported a widespread  illegal fishing
in the longline fishery for Toothfish. 
</td><td width=50% valign=top>
<p>The estimated  level of
illegal captures is between 100% to 200%  over the formal
quotas. The Scientific Committee of CCAMLR estimated that there
had been at least 2,870 tons of illegal catches taken in 1995
in the subarea 48.3 (South Georgias and Shag Rocks) (Antartic
Project,1996).
 
<p>As fish stocks decrease globally, economic pressure will compel
nations  with long distance fleets and investors, to increase
fishing activities in the southern ocean.

<p>Overexploitation is a generalized characteristic in the Chilean

if the deterioration of the main fishery resources biomass were
taken into account, the Gross Geographic  Product (GGP) of  the
Chilean fisheries sector, with an annual growing average of 8,8%
between 1980 to 1989, only has been growing at a value equal to
half of this official rate.

<p>An unpublished report of Chilean Ceine of the major
species reviewed, only one - Anchoveta - shows an increase in
biomass between 1985 and 1993. Four others showed signs of
severe overexploitation, with declines in its biomass of 96% for
Sardine, 85% for Patagonian Hake and 75% for Cusk Eel. Stocks
of Common Hake (Merluccius gayi) are reported to have decreased
by 30%.(Latin American Weekly Report, 12 September,1996, p:419).

<p>The southern  and subantarctic demersal fishery is the most
overexploited fishery in Chile. It is a clear example of  the
environmental and social impacts of  the export of fishing
over-capacity  and investment  to the southern  fisheries,
linked with  mismanagement, mistakes in the governmental stocks
evaluation, non existence of a management plan and weak  or
inexistent governmental control and monitoring systems.

 <td width=50% valign=top>
<p>This is a paradox situation, because the  southern demersal
fishery, started in 1976, had regulations of the industrial
vessels  and with TACs (Total Catch Allowed) determinations,
established across differents governmental resolutions.
 
<p>Nevertheless, TACs both for the small scale fishermen and the
industrial fleet,  have been assigned without real and reliable
scientific information of the states of stocks. At the present,
there is an unknown amount of different components in the
southern ecosystem  and little is known about its ecological
interrelations.

OPERATE.</b></h3></center>  
<tr><td width=50% valign=top>
<ul> 
<p><li type=square>From 1976 to the 90's  the bottom trawling fleet, mainly  linked
with european and asiatic TNCs  under Chilean flag, stimulating
the high international prices, caused the decrease of 87% of 
Patagonian Hake's biomass. Between 1986 and 1990, the capture

efforts grew by five times and created a strong overinvestment.
The
stock of Cusk Eel are reported to have decreased by 75%.
The effects on associated species are not known.
 
<p>There is also information indicating that in the fisheries for
Patagonian Hake, there is  about 70% of discard and waste. Cusk
Eel is in  an extremely deteriorated situation, as a consequence
of high levels of juveniles captures and pressure on the
recruitment stock. 
 
<p>During 1987 and 1988, there was a high level of illegal
captures in  the spawning and recruitment grounds in the
internal channels and fjords of Aysen and Magellan.
 
<p>This fishery shows a worrying development in technologies, as
the long liners have huge amounts of fishhooks, there is a lack
of regulation for fishhooks, double geared trawlers, huge ships
motorizations and the absense of geographic position system in
the industrial fleets.
 
<p>Chilean Undersecretary of Fisheries (1996), has stated that the
fishing efforts has been reduced by 80% during the last 6 years,
as a consequence of the strong reduction (87%) of  the
Patagonian Hake's biomass.
 
<p>The annual global quotas for Patagonian Hake and Cusk Eel now,
are reduced by 50% compared to 1991, including a reduction of
fishing seasons.
 
<p><li>From an estimated biomass of nearly 575.000 tons in 1985, the
biomass of  Patagonian Hake in 1993 was estimated to be less
than 85.000 tons.  That represent a  reduction of 85,2% of its
original biomass (Chilean Central Bank, unpublished data.).
Aguayo et al (196), characterizes  the Patagonian Hake
biologically overexploited.
 
<p><li >From  an estimated biomass of 65.000 tons in 1985, the 1993 Cusk
Eel biomass was estimated to 16.000 tons, representing a drop
of 75.3% from its original biomass.( Op.cit.).
 
<p>Presently there exists a high risk that the cusk eel stock might
be under the critical limits that permit its recovery, as a
consequence of the recruitment biomass dropping below 20%.
(Subpesca,1996 b)
 
<p><li>From the 92 industrial vessels fishing in 1988, there is only
21 left in the off shore waters and 8 in the internal channels
and fjords of Chile.  The main part of the other industrial
vessels, have changed to flags of convenience or to fish under
the Argentinian flag., fishing legally and /or illegally  in the
southern Atlantic, subantartics waters  and Indian Ocean, under
very risky condition for its crews. 
 
<li><p>From the 11 factory vessels that existed in the Chilean demersal
fishery in 1991, owned of transnational companies like
Nippon Suissan Kaisha,  Taiyo, Daerim Fisheries  and Pesca Nova,
only 3 vessels remain today.

<p>" Analyzing the present fisheries situation, this document
concludes that the only possibility to avoid making the
situation more critical, is to continue with severe catch level
controls, as to effectively protect the reproductive process of
the juvenile segment of the population. (...) If  these 
measures are not taken and strictly enforced, a collapse in
fisheries is a serious probability in a period no longer than
three year"
 

<p>According to Food and Agricultural Organisation by the UN (FAO),
overcapacity in the world's fishing fleets is more than a 100%.
In 13 of the 15 most important fishing regions, catches are
declining in spite of increased fishing efforts. In this
overexploited fishery in Chile, where exists no management plan
and nor a strong control system. 

  </td><td width=50% valign=top>

<p>The situation with the "American Monarch" illustrates not only
the problem of excessive fishing capacity, but the global
fishery crisis and more badly , the problem of food security,
lack of transparency and public control over fishing industry
and governmental policies.
 
<p>Adding  the "American Monarch" to the Chilean southern
demersal fishery, will result in overfishing and a collapse of
stocks and  thus the communities dependening upon it.
It will operate on the same zone where the patagonian hake
resource is overexploited and that a fishing effort increase
would have the situation become worse, thus affecting the
already precarious work sources of both the industrial and small
scale parties as well as endangering the sustaining of the
resource.
 
 
<p>Due to it's potential environmental and social impact, the
"American Monarch", must never be introduced to the Southern
Blue Whiting and Patagonian Grenadier fisheries in Chile.

<center><h2>FISHERIES AND THE WORLD FOOD SUPPLY</h2>
<table border=0 width=80% cellpadding=7>
<tr><td width=50% valign=top>
 
<p>Food production at a global level is in a state of crisis. In its
report State of the World 1995/96, the Worldwatch Institute
states that the decline in food is particularly noticeable in two
crucial areas, grain and fish. On a per capita basis, the amount
of grain and fish is declining from year to year, suggesting that
the production limits for the biosphere may have been reached. 
 
<p>While in 1984 there were 500 million people living below the
starvation level, by 1993, this figure had increased by 60% to
800 million. The Worldwatch Institute's Lester Brown notes that
signs are occurring in country after country that environmental
pressure, as well as technical and economic activities, are
creating increasing ecological and social problems. These are
growth related problems which cannot simply be solved by more
growth. Global overfishing cannot be solved by building more
ships when overcapacity is already a problem.

</td><td valign=top width=50%>
<p>Global fish production reached 100 million tonnes in 1989 and
increased to 109 million tonnes in 1994.  Between 1989 and 1993,
this figure had declined by four per cent in spite of an increase
of the fishing fleet both in quantity as well as in the form of
modern technology.  Catches increased again in 1994 largely due
to much greater catches of Peruvian anchoveta.  
 
<p>This level of fish production is only accomplished by
aquaculture. In 1984 the total contribution of fish and shellfish
farming amounted to 6.9 million tonnes. A decade later, it had
almost tripled to 18.5 million tonnes. While some may view this
as a solution, it is actually part of the problem, for these
farmed fish require food, and much of the food comes from
fishmeal. This creates the ironic and ultimately disastrous,
situation in which fish are caught, not to feed people, but to
feed to other fish which people will then eat. This circle cannot
expand forever, so aquaculture is not a solution for the
declining food supply of fisheries resulting from fisheries
mismanagement.
</td></tr></table> 

<p><b><h3><center>GLOBAL EXCESS FISHING CAPACITY</center></h3></b>
<table border=0 width=80% cellpadding=7><tr><td width=50%>

<p>In spite of the massive excess capacity in fisheries around the
globe, the building of new and more efficient ships continues
unabated. Between 1970 and 1990, the FAO recorded a doubling of
the global fishing fleet, from 585,000 medium and large-sized
vessels to 1.2 million. This is made possible by governments
providing extensive subsidies for shipbuilding. The extent of
these subsidies is alarming; FAO has calculated that the losses
of the global fishing fleet, on an annual basis, amount to an
incredible US$54 billion. It is easy to conclude that these
subsidies are the engine of today's overfishing.
</td><td valign=top width=50%> 
<p>Unemployment is another major problem in many areas of the world,
and fishing companies and shipowners often argue that new vessels
create jobs. However, it depends on what vessels are built and
how they are used. There is a great disparity between the numbers
of jobs provided by vessels such as the American Monarch and
those in small-scale fisheries:
</tr></table>
<Center>
<table border=0><tr><td>
<b>
<Ul> 
<li>0.2-0.3 million people are employed on large-scale vessels
<li>0.9-1.0 million people are employed on medium sized vessels
<li>14-20  million people are employed on artisanal and small vessels
</ul>
</b>
</tr></table>
</center> 

<p>The overall contribution of small vessels to employment is not
their only advantage. In order to catch a given amount of fish,
this sector employs more people, create less waste and has less
need of capital.

<h2>Foreword.</h2>

Food production at a global level is in a crisis. In its report 
State of the World 1995/96, the Worldwatch Institute states that 
the decline is particularly noticeable in two areas crucial for 
the global food production: grain and fish. In both these areas, 
the limit for the production ability of the biosphere seems to 
have been reached. On a per capita basis, the amount of grain and 
fish is declining from year to year. Lester R. Brown points to 
the fact that the biological production systems, the very 
foundation of the world economy, are about to be overloaded. 
Overfishing of the world's marine resources cannot be solved by 
building more ships when overcapacity is already a problem.
<p>
It is in that context that Greenpeace puts the spot light on 
Resources Group International (RGI) and the fishing activities of 
that company. RGI has now set its eyes on Chile, a country whose 
fish resources are already extensively harvested. The American 
Monarch, which RGI is currently building and plans to send to 
Chile, will be the world's most efficient factory trawler.
<p>
This report will show conclusively that the addition of the 
American Monarch to the fishery in Chilean waters will result in 
overfishing and possible collapse of the stock and thus the 
communities dependent upon it. This is documented using 
publically available statistics, including RGI's own reports. The 
arguments which form the basis of RGI's decision to send the 
American Monarch to Chile are reviewed and strongly critised.
<p>
If RGI is sincere in their public statements that they are 
concerned with the need for sustainable fisheries, the company 
sould make one decision and one decision only: to withdraw the 
plans to send the American Monarch to fish in Chile. On the other 
hand, alternative locations for the ship to fish are not obvious. 
It is an open question whether factory trawlers like the American 
Monarch have a future at all. All signs suggest that they do not.

<H1>Options for Extension of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty<br>A Legal Analysis</H1>
<A Name = textf1> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef1">  [1]</A> <P>
By Duncan Currie, Greenpeace International Legal Department
<p><h3>
<A HREF = "#Table_of_Contents">Table of Contents</A> </H3>
<P>
<H1><A NAME=h_1_introduction> </A> </H1>
<H1>1.    Introduction</H1>
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons<A NAME= h_textf2> </A> 
<A Name = textf2> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef2">  [2]</A>  ('NPT') was concluded in 1968 
and is aimed at the promotion of nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
attempts to freeze the transfer of nuclear weapons technology from nuclear to non-nuclear states. The 
NPT was concluded for an initial 25 years after its entry into force in 1970.<A NAME= h_textf3> </A> 
<A Name = textf3> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef3">  [3]</A> <P>


Article X(2) of the NPT reads as follows:<P><ul>
Twenty-five years after the entry into force of the Treaty, a conference shall be 
convened to decide whether the Treaty shall continue in force indefinitely, or shall be 
extended for an additional fixed period or periods. This decision shall be taken by a 
majority of the Parties to the Treaty.<P>
</UL>
Thus a conference is due to be held on 17 April to 12 May 1995 in New York to decide the extension of the 
NPT and review its implementation.<A NAME= h_textf4> </A> 
<A Name = textf4> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef4">  [4]</A>  <P>
Three options are expressed in Article X(2): the Treaty shall continue in force indefinitely, the Treaty shall 
be extended for an additional fixed period, or the Treaty shall be extended for additional fixed periods. <P>
Discussion about extension of the NPT should be viewed in the political context of the debate. Questions 
of interpretation of Article X cannot be resolved in a political vacuum. As was noted in a general 
context,<P>
Many disputes which appear to be disputes about the correct interpretation of a treaty 
or customary law have hidden motivation. Judicial resolution in terms of legal issues 
presented would not touch the real source of the difficulties, the real problems and 
policies that are involved.<A NAME= h_textf5> </A> 
<A Name = textf5> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef5">  [5]</A> <P>
Shabtai Rosenne likewise noted that <P><UL>
[T]he harsh fact is that the elements of the law of treaties and indeed the treaties 
themselves are completely overshadowed by the graver clashes of interests, even 
vital interests, not merely of the States immediately and directly concerned, but of 
others as well. It is a tendentious and misleading oversimplification to treat them as 
disputes of an exclusively legal character, as 'legal disputes' or as 'legal questions'.<A NAME= h_textf6> </A> 
<A Name = textf6> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef6">  [6]</A> <P></UL>
That nuclear interests affected by the NPT affect the vital interests of both nuclear and non-nuclear states 
Party is clear.<A NAME= h_textf7> </A> 
<A Name = textf7> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef7">  [7]</A>  Thus it is vitally important that 
Article X be seen as clearly and dispassionately as possible in order that the pending Extension 
Conference in 1995 can take place in a broad and realistic political context. This political dimension is 
been seen in the varying interpretations of Article X in the literature to date.<A NAME= h_textf8> </A> 
<A Name = textf8> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef8">  [8]</A> <P>
The essential argument is between those that favour an indefinite extension, consisting primarily of nuclear 
weapons states, and those that favour renewal for single or multiple periods, often predicated upon 
progress in achieving a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ("CTBT"), security assurances and wider 
adherence to the NPT.<P>
This paper concludes that there is considerable latitude given to the Parties, that if the Parties do not 
reach an agreement then the Treaty will expire, and that a rolling set of fixed periods of extension with a 
decision-making mechanism between them about continuing on into the next period is compatible with the 
provisions of the NPT.<P>
<H1><A NAME=h_2_background_on_the_npt> </A> </H1>
<H1>2.    Background on the NPT</H1>
The two-tiered nature of the NPT was agreed to by the non-nuclear weapons states predicated<A NAME= h_textf9> </A> 
<A Name = textf9> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef9">  [9]</A>  upon undertakings towards 
concrete steps towards disarmament, including a mandatory initial 5 year review and optional subsequent 
reviews every five years with a view to assuring that the purposes of the Preamble and the provisions of 
the Treaty are being realised,<A NAME= h_textf10> </A> 
<A Name = textf10> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef10">  [10]</A>  together with five tangible 
steps to halt the nuclear arms race and limit, reduce and eliminate the stocks of nuclear weapons and 
delivery systems.<A NAME= h_textf11> </A> 
<A Name = textf11> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef11">  [11]</A>  The five yearly review 
Conferences have shown that none of the five steps have been reached and therefore some non-nuclear 
powers argue that the nuclear powers have breached their obligations, including in particular Article VI.<A NAME= h_textf12> </A> 
<A Name = textf12> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef12">  [12]</A>  Negotiations towards a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban, nearly twenty-five years after entry into force of the Convention, have 
only recently commenced in Geneva. The ABM Treaty,<A NAME= h_textf13> </A> 
<A Name = textf13> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef13">  [13]</A>  Intermediate-range Nuclear 
Forces Treaty<A NAME= h_textf14> </A> 
<A Name = textf14> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef14">  [14]</A>  and STARTs I and II  
represent only halting progress towards ceasing the nuclear arms race. Many non-nuclear weapons states 
would argue the world is not even close to nuclear or general disarmament and the review conferences 
have revealed that the purposes of the Preamble and the provisions of the Treaty, Article VI in particular, 
are far from being realised.<A NAME= h_textf15> </A>

</H1>
<H2><A NAME=h_3_1_traveaux_préparatoires> </A> </H2>
<H2>3.1    Traveaux Préparatoires</H2>
Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties<A NAME= h_textf16> </A> 
<br><A HREF="vien-tr.html#h_article_32_supplementary_means_of_i"> Goto Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</A><br>
<A Name = textf16> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef16">  [16]</A>  permits recourse to 
supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work<A NAME= h_textf17> </A> 

<A Name = textf17> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef17">  [17]</A>  of the treaty (<I>traveaux 
préparatoires</I>) and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning or to determine 
the meaning when the interpretation leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure or  leads to a result which 
is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. The extension provisions of Article X (2) are both ambiguous and 
obscure, thus recourse to <I>traveaux préparatoires</I> appears amply justified.<P>
The intention of the non-nuclear states in insisting on the five yearly review provisions was that this would 
provide the framework for the momentum towards achieving the five tangible steps towards disarmament. 
The extension provisions of Article X can then be seen in context of being intended to facilitate the 
finalization of remaining steps.<P>
George Bunn has noted that instead of the indefinite term advocated by the Soviet Union and the United 
States, Italy and other non-nuclear states proposed that the NPT should be of fixed term but automatically 
renewable for additional fixed terms, but allow parties to withdraw at the end of any term.<A NAME=h_textf18> </A> 
<A Name = textf18> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef18">  [18]</A>  This proposal gave rise to 
the 'additional fixed periods' concept, but the right of individual withdrawal was rejected in favour of the 
provision to end the treaty for all parties either by a short extension in 1995 or by non-renewal at the end 
of an additional fixed period.<P>
<H2><A NAME=h_3_2_subsequent_practice> </A> </H2>
<H2>3.2    Subsequent Practice</H2>
The Vienna Convention mandates in Article 31 
<br><A HREF="vien-tr.html#h_article_31_general_rule_of_interpre"> Goto Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</A><br>
that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance 
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object 
and purpose. Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or 
the application of its provisions is taken into account, as is any subsequent practice in the application of 
the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. A special meaning 
shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. Most notably, a practice has 
evolved whereby an abstention by a permament member of the Security Council is not considered a veto, 
contrary to the language of Article 27(3) of the United Nations Charter.<A NAME= h_textf19> </A> 

<A Name = textf19> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef19">  [19]</A> <P>
Thus any interpretation of Article X should be viewed not only in the wider context of the NPT but in light of 
practice by the NPT Parties and any agreement between the Parties. Such an interpretation would 
strongly militate against a restrictive interpretation of Article X relating to such matters as conditions on 
renewals. <P>
During the 1990 Fourth Review Conference, a number of non-nuclear states called for a comprehensive 
nuclear test ban treaty which would facilitate the extension of the NPT for a significant period beyond 
1995.<A NAME= h_textf20> </A> 
<A Name = textf20> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef20">  [20]</A>  Other working papers 
explicitly drew the connection between Article VI and Article X.<A NAME= h_textf21> </A> 
<A Name = textf21> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef21">  [21]</A>  Working Group I at the 
1994 Pugwash Conference concluded that:<P>
This Group is wholly convinced of the necessity of extending the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty beyond 1995, for one or more fixed periods, and is opposed to an indefinite 
extension. The extension(s) must be of a finite duration to prevent the permanent 
categorization of some nations as 'nuclear weapon states' and the implicit legalization 
and acceptance of nuclear weapons. One or more periods of extension should be 
envisaged; a majority urged that they be linked to the completion of explicit 
disarmament measures. A 25 year period, to reach a nuclear-weapon-free world, was 
urged.<A NAME= h_textf22> </A>

<H2>4.1    General Procedural Considerations 
and Failure to Reach a Decision</H2>
Any decision must be taken by a majority of the Parties to the Treaty, not simply a majority of Parties 
attending the Extension Conference. If the Conference fails to achieve a majority in favour of one of the 
extension options, then there seems to be no reason that the Parties could not agree, by majority, not to 
extend the Treaty. In this way, Article X could be read as permitting Parties to agree to extend the NPT in 
one of the three suggested ways - or not. It is by no means certain that this interpretation, particularly if it 
were adopted by a majority of the Parties to the NPT, would be <I>ultra vires</I> Article X.<A NAME=h_textf47> </A> 
<A Name = textf47> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef47">  [47]</A>  It has been argued that 
failure to reach any decision could not result in termination since this would in effect amount to a right of 
termination which is not provided for in the Treaty.<A NAME= h_textf48> </A> 
<A Name = textf48> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef48">  [48]</A>  However conversely this 
could be seen as an expiration of the natural duration of the treaty, absent a decision to extend the treaty. 
An interpretation of Article X which restricted any possible decision to the three listed options, but 
permitted, for instance, an extension of one day<A NAME= h_textf49> </A> 
<A Name = textf49> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef49">  [49]</A>  would be unduly narrow. 
Other authors have suggested that failure to reach agreement would mean that once the extension 
conference is convened it should continue "until it reaches one of the alternatives open to it"<A NAME=h_textf50> </A> 
<A Name = textf50> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef50">  [50]</A>  and that the conference 
must continue in being so that it can reconvene, and that should it be unable to reach a decision within 
some reasonable time, "the parties could consider that the Treaty had lapsed and declare that judgement 
to the depositaries without reference to the provisions for withdrawal in article X(1)".<A NAME=h_textf51> </A> 
<A Name = textf51> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef51">  [51]</A>  <P>
However, while this may be a course open to the parties, a more straightforward conclusion may be that 
failure to reach agreement could lead to automatic termination at the conclusion of the conference. Epstein 
and Szasz suggested that such a step, even if it did not formally require notification to the Security Council 
under Article X(1), may  nonetheless prompt the Security Council to resolve that any withdrawal from the 
NPT constitutes a threat to peace under Article 39 of the United Nations Charter and is therefore not 
permissible.<A NAME= h_textf52> </A> 
<A Name = textf52> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef52">  [52]</A>  However, apart from a 
query whether such a step would in fact constitute a 'withdrawal', it is speculative that the Security Council 
would pass such a resolution, even if such a resolution, concerning as it would the necessary 
consequence of the failure of Parties to reach a decision, would be soundly based.<A NAME=h_textf53> </A> 
<A Name = textf53> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef53">  [53]</A> <P>
Hoinkes<A NAME= h_textf54> </A> 
<A Name = textf54> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef54">  [54]</A> considers the 
Epstein/Szasz suggestion of declaring the Treaty to have lapsed 'gratuitous' and suggests that a 
"straightforward reading of the text comes the conclusion that the Treaty cannot be terminated other than 
by exhaustion of either a single period of extension or the last in a series of periods of extension". 
However, it is not easy to extract such a meaning from the text of the Treaty. The Parties certainly may 
choose one of the three stated options, following which the Treaty may expire. However if the Parties do 
not choose one of the options, the Parties could thereby  have chosen not to extend the treaty at all. By 
necessary inference, a Treaty which is not extended has surely expired: otherwise there is no need for 
extension. <P>
Another interpretation is that the Parties may choose 'whether the Treaty shall continue in force 
indefinitely', on the one hand, or whether it 'shall be extended for an additional fixed period or periods' on 
the other. Either choice requires a decision. It must be noted that the Parties could not agree on indefinite 
duration when the Treaty was concluded, thus even if Article X could be said to be the <I>quid pro quo</I> 
for an otherwise indefinite treaty, that compromise resulted in the need for a choice. In other words, a 
second opportunity is presented for the parties to agree on an indefinite duration. It appears difficult to 
conclude that the non-nuclear states may be said to have consented to an indefinite agreement if parties 
cannot reach any agreement at all in 1995, as well as if parties agree to such an agreement, particularly in 
view of the use of the term 'extended': as noted, an indefinite agreement is surely not capable of 
'extension'. The better view is thus that the NPT would expire if no extension agreement is reached. A 
paper presented by Germany on behalf of the European Union similarly concludes that "while the NPT 
would be deemed to be terminated if the Conference failed to take a decision on extension, the 
Conference cannot be closed without a decision on extension pursuant to article X.2." <A NAME=h_textf55> </A> 
<A Name = textf55> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef55">  [55]</A> <P>
Looking at the matter from a different angle, Epstein and Szasz suggest that the Article X(2) option for 
indefinite extension would be otiose if the Treaty was already of indefinite duration.<A NAME=h_textf56> </A> 
<A Name = textf56> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef56">  [56]</A>  The two authors note that if 
the Parties fail to agree on any of the Article X(2) options, an interpretation which would not permit the 
Treaty to expire until one of the Article X(2) conditions are fulfilled is to create an indefinite treaty by 
inaction:<A NAME= h_textf57> </A> 
<A Name = textf57> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef57">  [57]</A>  a result which would 
replace an explicit method of extending the treaty indefinitely by majority agreement with one which would 
extend the treaty indefinitely because majority agreement could not be obtained. This rather attractive view 
is, however, rather difficult to reconcile with Epstein and Szasz's later suggestion that the NPT should be 
considered as staying in effect for up to another five year period, while the parties endeavour to reach 
decision.<A NAME= h_textf58> </A> 
<A Name = textf58> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef58">  [58]</A> Attractive and sensible as 
this suggestion is, it is difficult to extract from the text of Article X. A solution more consistent with Article X 
and more certain would be for the Parties to agree to further additional extension periods subject to 
conditional reviews, the first period being for five years.<P>
Epstein and Szasz suggest an additional option: that if no CTBT is concluded prior to the Extension 
Conference, the Parties may decide to recess the conference and reconvene when a CTBT is concluded 
or some other treaty such as a treaty covering fissionable material for weapons, nuclear disarmament or a 
non-first-use agreement is signed.<A NAME= h_textf59> </A> 
<A Name = textf59> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef59">  [59]</A> However, such a course 
would be controversial and perhaps hazardous, in light of the ambiguous wording of Article X, and may 
open the way for parties to declare their belief that the NPT is at an end, thus giving rise to uncertainty at 
best and further controversy and instability at worst. <P>
It is usefel to refer to the current draft Rules of Procedure in this respect.<P>
<H3><A NAME=h_4_1_1_rules_of_procedure> </A> </H3>
<H3>4.1.1    Rules of Procedure</H3>
Rule 28(3) of the draft Rules of Procedure for the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference<A NAME= h_textf60> </A> 
<A Name = textf60> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef60">  [60]</A>  provides that:<P>
(a)  The requirements of paragraph 2 of article X of the Treaty shall be considered met 
when there is a consensus in support of a proposal made in accordance with that 
paragraph,  provided that the Conference is quorate as defined in Rule 13.<A NAME= h_textf61> </A> 
<A Name = textf61> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef61">  [61]</A> <P>
(b)  If, notwithstanding the best efforts of delegates to achieve a consensus decision 
on extension, a proposal or proposals come up for voting, the President shall defer the  
vote for 48 hours and during this period of deferment shall make every effort, with the 
assistance of the General Committee, to facilitate the achievement of general 
agreement and shall report to the Conference prior to the end of the period.<P>
(c)  If by the end of the period of deferment the Conference has not reached a 
consensus decision on the extension, voting shall take place and the decision shall be 
taken by a  majority of the Parties to the Treaty, in accordance with paragraph 2 of 
article X.<P>
(d)  The Conference may be closed only when the decision required by paragraph 2 of 
article X of the Treaty has been reached.<P>
Thus the draft Rules contemplate that the Conference remains open until a majority decision has been 
reached. Under draft Rule 20,  a representative may at any time move the suspension or the adjournment 
of the meeting. No discussion on such motions shall be permitted and such motions shall, subject to rule 
23,<A NAME= h_textf62> </A> 
<A Name = textf62> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef62">  [62]</A>  be immediately put to the 
vote.<P>
Paragraph 16 of the German paper<A NAME= h_textf63> </A> 
<A Name = textf63> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef63">  [63]</A>  claims that it is implicit that 
the Treaty must continue in force while the Conference is in session and that therefore while the 
Conference is suspended or adjourned the Treaty continues in force. To avoid this possibility, however, 
would appear to require a mechanism for restricting the duration of a suspension or adjournment. As 
neither the Treaty nor the draft Rules of Procedure for the Conference give guidance on the possible 
duration of such a suspension or adjournment it would seem necessary to specify the suspension and 
adjournment options possible in the Rules of Procedure or by a Resolution of the Conference as part of 
any suspension or adjournment decision. If this was the means chosen, it would seem desirable for the 
Parties to have the possibility of restricting this in terms of limits on the duration of any suspension or 
adjournment. However it should be emphasized that in view of the difficulties of interpretation surrounding 
Article X and the termination of the Treaty, any suspension or adjournment of the NPT beyond the current 
meeting may give rise to claims by Parties that the Treaty has terminated. Thus use of suspension or 
adjournment as a device for <I>de facto</I> unlimited extension would be controversial at best and at 
would be likely to give rise to instability and uncertainty as to the status of the Treaty. In particular, 
suspension may be viewed as such a device, as may be any adjournment of excessive length or without a 
specific timetable attached.<P>
If the draft Rule of Procedure 28(3)(d) is adopted by the 1995 Conference as drafted, the Conference will 
not be able to be terminated without taking a decision pursuant to Article X.2, and thus the possibility of an 
automatic termination of the NPT by a failure to reach a majority decision on an extension option would 
thus be averted provided that an attempt at indefinite or long term suspension or adjournment is not made 
so as to give rise to uncertainty as to the continued viability of the Treaty. This would then appear to 
strengthen the importance of the conditions which need to be attached to any suspension or adjournment 
decision of the 1995 Conference to ensure that the Treaty remains in force during the suspension or 
adjournment period.<P>
In conclusion, Article X is far from clear and there is a difficult question of interpretation which will be 
resolved by standard rules of interpretation including reference to the context of Article X and the 
subsequent practice of the parties at the extension conference and possibly beyond.<P>
<H2><A NAME=h_4_2_timing_of_the_decision> </A> </H2>
<H2>4.2    Timing of the Decision</H2>
One tactical issue is the timing of the extension of the decision. John Simpson of Southampton University 
has noted<A NAME= h_textf64> </A> 
<A Name = textf64> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef64">  [64]</A>  that Foreign Ministers may 
be present during the early part of the conference, and any decision made at this time could strengthen 
the legitimacy of the vote and avoid the necessity of reference of delegates to capitals for decisionmaking. 
However, there are far stronger arguments for the decision to be made at the end of the conference, when 
the review process would have been completed. The latter would with respect appear to be the more 
logical solution, as the conclusions of the review would be available to crucial in assisting any extension 
decision. This approach would also allow more time for consultation and negotiation.<P>
Preparatory Committee meetings have been held throughout 1993 and 1994<A NAME= h_textf65> </A> 
<A Name = textf65> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef65">  [65]</A>  to settle procedural issues. 
At present, the conference is due to consist of a plenary session of 5-10 days in which heads of delegation 
will make formal opening statements, a following period of 5-10 days in which committees will examine the 
implementation of the NPT and a final period of 5-7 days when a drafting committee and other groups will 
attempt to finalize the Final Document.<P>

Hoinkes, arguing for an indefinite extension<A NAME= h_textf76> </A> 
<A Name = textf76> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef76">  [76]</A>  argues that Article X 
provides only one shot at unlimited duration. <A NAME= h_textf77> </A> 
<A Name = textf77> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef77">  [77]</A>  She accepts that unlimited 
duration was unachievable by consensus at the time the Treaty was concluded and argues that "if a 
majority of the parties does not opt for unlimited duration after twenty-five years, the opportunity is lost, 
unless the Treaty is amended, and if a majority of the parties opts for extension for a single fixed period or 
a series of fixed periods, the Treaty will expire at the end of the period or periods unless it is amended."<A NAME= h_textf78> </A> 
<A Name = textf78> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef78">  [78]</A> It would appear correct that 
the option of indefinite duration as such is only available at the extension conference. However as a 
suitably large number of fixed periods - such as one hundred five year periods, for the sake of argument - 
subject to conditions, which are not excluded by Article X, may for all practical purposes approximate an 
extension of indefinite duration, the point seems academic. In fact the main substantive difference 
between the two results would be that multiple fixed term renewal would provide an opportunity for regular 
review to ensure the Treaty is achieving its objectives in a way that indefinite extension would not, and 
thus may be more consistent with the objects and principles of the Treaty, with the expressed wishes of 
many non-nuclear states to link extension with progress towards the Article VI objects and particularly a 
CTBT<A NAME= h_textf79> </A> 
<A Name = textf79> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef79">  [79]</A>  and with the existing review

Period</H2>
If one fixed period is chosen, the treaty would terminate at the expiration of that period, which could be of 
any duration. No further extension would be possible without further agreement of the parties and 
amendment of the NPT. While it has been argued that only one extension conference is authorized by 
Article X and that an amendment of the Treaty  would be necessary to permit such a conference,<A NAME= h_textf80> </A> 
<A Name = textf80> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef80">  [80]</A>  it would be unduly 
restrictive to argue that a further conference is not permitted by Article X: Article X is silent on the matter. 
Parties, or non-Parties, for that matter, could still agree outside the NPT to hold a further conference to 
discuss possible extension by amendment, for instance. No breach of the NPT would be thereby incurred 
by the conference alone. Likewise, while obviously further extension of the treaty under the majority 
provisions of Article X(2) would not be possible,<A NAME= h_textf81> </A> 
<A Name = textf81> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef81">  [81]</A>  there is no reason parties 
cannot otherwise agree prior to or at subsequent termination to renew the treaty by amendment.<A NAME= h_textf82> </A> 
<A Name = textf82> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef82">  [82]</A>  Clearly such an agreement 
would need to comply with the special majority requirements of Article VIII(2).<A NAME= h_textf83> 
</A> 
<A Name = textf83> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef83">  [83]</A> <P>
Epstein and Szasz have suggested that a majority of the Parties could provide for a single extension, at 
the end of which the parties would again be able to select one of the Article X(2) options.<A NAME=h_textf84> </A> 
<A Name = textf84> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef84">  [84]</A>  While such a view has the 
advantage of flexibility, Article X(2) merely provides for the three options as being applicable after twenty-
five years after entry into force of the Treaty. It would be a lengthy extension to apply the same options 
after some further review period. The better view is that if Parties resolved to renew for one single fixed 
period, then that is the binding decision under Article X(2) and any further extension would have to take 
place under the more formal amendment provisions of Article VIII.<P>
It has been suggested that the extension conference is not authorized to choose a single fixed period to be 
followed by another extension conference.<A NAME= h_textf85> </A> 
<A Name = textf85> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef85">  [85]</A>  This observation is 
misleading at best. It is true that a single fixed period means just that, but there is no prohibition on a 
further conference, if the parties so choose. However any further extension would require a treaty 
amendment. This restriction does not apply to multiple extension periods, with intervening 
conferences.<P>
<H2><A NAME=h_4_5_extension_for_additional_fixed_
> </A> </H2>
<H2>4.5    Extension for Additional Fixed 
Periods</H2>
There can be any number of additional fixed periods, which can themselves be for any duration, including 
a number of fixed periods of different duration. <P>
The conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty may have an impact on the duration of the NPT insofar 
as such developments are of a fundamental or vital character.<A NAME= h_textf86> </A> 
<A Name = textf86> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef86">  [86]</A>  Insofar as such a treaty 
would render Article V not only obsolete but effectively repealed as between parties to both instruments,  
although <I>rebus sic stantibus</I> may not strictly speaking apply as a CTBT was in fact foreseen by the 
parties in the preamble,<A NAME= h_textf87> </A> 
<A Name = textf87> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef87">  [87]</A> the possibility significantly 
strengthens the argument for tying any fixed extension periods to developments such as a CTBT.<P>
George Bunn  has suggested multiple twenty-five year renewal periods, automatically renewed unless a 
majority of the Parties decide to terminate the Treaty at the end of any period.<A NAME= h_textf88> 
</A> 
<A Name = textf88> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef88">  [88]</A>  This has the advantage 
that the renewals are explicitly authorized by Article X. Bunn argues that any subsequent review 
conference would simply decide to halt further automatic renewals, and thus would not qualify as an 
extension conference.<A NAME= h_textf89> </A> 
<A Name = textf89> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef89">  [89]</A>  However at first sight this 
may only solve part of the problem. A contrary argument would be that periods fixed by the 1995 extension 
conference are just that, and no subsequent conference may purport to terminate the period. However 
termination by agreement of all the Parties is always permissible under Article 54 of the Vienna 
Convention, 
<br><A HREF="vien-tr.html#h_article_54_termination_of_or_withdr"> Goto Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</A><br>
upon consultation with contracting States. <P>
Obviously an extension mechanism is equally valid irrespective of the duration of the extension period and 
therefore, for example, extensions of 5 years in duration could offer additional advantages by linking closer 
the review of the operation of the Treaty with decisions to proceed from one extension period to 
another.<P>
Moreover, if Parties to the NPT evince a clear intention in the extension conference and thereafter to 
agree to multiple renewals of the Treaty conditional upon a subsequent event, such as the signing of a 
treaty, or Conference, then such intention should be taken as subsequent agreement between the parties 
regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions under Article 31 of the Vienna 
Convention, 
<br><A HREF="vien-tr.html#h_article_31_general_rule_of_interpre"> Goto Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</A><br>
together with any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the 
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation, and as such would guide the interpretation of Article 
X. This is particularly so as it is difficult to otherwise ascribe a sensible meaning to the words 'or periods', 
as multiple automatic periods are in reality no different than one period if there is no intervening event 
which may render a later period less than inevitable.<P>
In a suggestion perhaps giving rise to a little more difficulty, one or more twenty five year periods with 
review conferences every five years and extension conferences at the end of each period has been 
suggested.<A NAME= h_textf90> </A> 
<A Name = textf90> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef90">  [90]</A>  There certainly seems to 
be no reason that Article VIII.3 should not continue in force so further <I>review</I> conferences are 
permitted. This suggestion may meet with an objection that <I>extension</I> conferences are not, 
however permitted. However, agreement and subsequent practice of the parties can not be excluded as a 
sufficient basis for further conferences, as there are no clear prohibitions of such conferences in the text of 
the Treaty.<P>
<H3><A NAME=h_4_5_1_conditions_for_renewal> </A> </H3>
<H3>4.5.1    Conditions for Renewal</H3>
Different periods could be automatic or predicated upon conditions, as Article X is silent on the matter. 
However the periods must be 'fixed'. This would appear to mean fixed in duration, although perhaps 
another means of fixation through mechanism of the parties or an external mechanism may not be 
excluded. A decision setting a certain number of fixed periods, each contingent upon the satisfaction of 
certain criteria, would appear to satisfy Article X. It has been argued that conditions are required for a 
number of fixed periods, as something must take place before the end of each successive period in order 
to give meaning to the plural 'periods'.<A NAME= h_textf91> </A> 
<A Name = textf91> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef91">  [91]</A> Whether conditions are 
required, they certainly appear consistent with Article X, particularly in light of the existing review 
provisions of Article VIII.<A NAME= h_textf92> </A> 
<A Name = textf92> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef92">  [92]</A> <P>
There are clearly risks associated with setting absolute time-limits to steps to be achieved within each 
extension period. However, the value of being able to specify goals for the performance of the Treaty's 
operation in a given period as a factor relating to its renewal at the end of that period, can also be seen to 
be a valuable mechanism for enhancing the performance of the Treaty. In particular, goals such as a 
CBTB, negotiations and progress towards realization of the Article VI goals would be both tangible and 
directly relevant to the Treaty.<P>
It has been suggested that the treaty does not authorize the Conference to condition the extension 
decision on a CTBT.<A NAME= h_textf93> </A> 
<A Name = textf93> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef93">  [93]</A>  With respect, no restriction 
is nowhere supported by either the text of the NPT nor the <I>traveaux préparatoires, </I>wherein the 
negotiators clearly considered a CBT and other disarmament goals relevant considerations to the duration 
question,<A NAME= h_textf94> </A> 
<A Name = textf94> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef94">  [94]</A>  or by the discussions of the 
Parties to date.<A NAME= h_textf95> </A> 
<A Name = textf95> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef95">  [95]</A>  Notably, Mr Graham does 
not dispute the legality of the attachment of conditions to an extension decision, noting only 'obvious 
dangers' to such an approach and the precedent it would set.<A NAME= h_textf96> </A> 
<A Name = textf96> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef96">  [96]</A>  It would be peculiar, to say 
the least, to permit the attachment of conditions to an extension decision yet not to deny the relevance of 
conditions to the extension decision itself. Mr Graham does agree that a decision for multiple fixed 
extension periods, with a transition mechanism between periods, would be permissible.<A NAME= h_textf97> </A> 
<A Name = textf97> </A>  <A HREF = "#notef97">  [97]</A> <P>
<A NAME=h_4_5_2_the_number_of_multiple_fixed_> </A> </H1>
<H3>4.5.2    The Number of Multiple Fixed Periods</H3>
The question may arise whether the Parties could agree to an open-ended number of fixed periods, each 
being followed by a conference, or whether the number as well as duration of the periods should be fixed. 
It would not seem inconsistent with the Treaty if the Parties agreed to an open-ended number of periods. 
Article X, in providing the option that the Treaty "shall be extended for an additional fixed period or periods" 
would not seem to prohibit what would effectively be an automatic renewal system, or, put another way, an 
indefinite treaty with the possibility of termination at the end of any given fixed period. If the Parties so 
decided, then that decision should colour any interpretation according to Article 31 of the Vienna 
Convention. <P>
<br><A HREF="vien-tr.html#h_article_31_general_rule_of_interpre"> Goto Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</A><br>

<H1><A NAME=h_5_conclusions_and_a_suggested_exten> </A> </H1>

<H1>5.    Conclusions and A Suggested Extension Option</H1>
There is considerable latitude available to the Parties in deciding on whether and how to extend  the 
Treaty under Article X.2. A rolling set of fixed periods of extension with a decision-making mechanism 
linked to conditions between each period addressing the continued extension of the Treaty into the next 
period of extension is fully compatible with the provisions of the NPT.<P>
A failure by a majority of the Parties to reach agreement on an extension option at the 1995 Review and 
Extension Conference could lead to automatic termination at the conclusion of the conference. <P>
Rule 28(3)(d) of the provisional draft Rules of Procedure attempts to prevent this by only permitting the 
Conference to be closed when the decision required by Article X.2 has been reached. It has been 
suggested that it is implicit that the Treaty must continue in force while the Conference is in session and, 
therefore, if the Conference is suspended or adjourned the Treaty continues in force. However to avoid the 
uncertainty as to the Treaty's continued efficacy which would accompany an open-ended suspension or 
adjournment a mechanism would be required for carefully restricting and defining the duration and 
conditions of any suspension or adjournment. As neither the Treaty nor the draft Rules of Procedure for 
the Conference give guidance on the possible duration of such a suspension or adjournment it would seem 
necessary to specify the suspension and adjournment options possible in the Rules of Procedure or by a 
Resolution of the Conference as part of such a decision.<P>
The following components of an NPT extension option are suggested for the consideration of the 
Parties:<P>
1.     extension for an open-ended series of fixed extensions of five years duration;<P>
2.     a Conference between each period to decide whether or not to continue further renewals. A decision 
to proceed with each period of renewal would be taken following a review of the operation of the 
Treaty at a Conference to take place at the end of each 5 year period;<P>
3.     at each such Conference, objectives for the operation of the Treaty in the subsequent 5 yearly 
period or periods shall be specified by the Parties to the Treaty.  <P>These could include:<P>
<uL>
(a)     conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty;<P>
(b)     satisfactory ratification and observance of such a treaty;<P>
(c)     good faith negotiations and concrete progress on effective measures moving towards to 
cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament; and<P>
(d)     good faith negotiations towards a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict 
and effective international control.<P>

treaty provided that the intention of the parties to this end is clear (G. Haraszti, <I>Some Fundamental 
Problems of the Law of Treaties</I>," Akadamiai Kiado, Budapest (1973), 238-9, citing W.E. Hall,

Treaties (Harvard Draft Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1935 <I>A.J.I.L.</I> (Suppl.), 1169) preferred 
express agreement. However the express language of Article X would appear to exclude implicit renewal 
in the case of the NPT treaty.

729 UNTS 161, UKTS 88 (1970), 7 ILM 809, 21 UST 483<p>
<p>
The States concluding this Treaty, hereinafter referred to as the "Parties to the Treaty",<p>
Considering the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind by a nuclear war and the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war and to take measures to safeguard the security of peoples,<p>
Believing that the proliferation of nuclear weapons would seriously enhance the danger of nuclear war,<p>
In conformity with resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly calling for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of wider dissemination of nuclear weapons,<p>
Undertaking to co-operate in facilitating the application of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on peaceful nuclear activities,<p>
Expressing their support for research, development and other efforts to further the application, within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system, of the principle of safeguarding effectively the flow of source and special fissionable materials by use of instruments and other techniques at certain strategic points,<p>
Affirming the principle that the benefits of peaceful applications of nuclear technology, including any technological by-products which may be derived by nuclear-weapon States from the development of nuclear explosive devices, should be available for peaceful purposes to all Parties to the Treaty, whether nuclear-weapon or non-nuclear-weapon States,<p>
Convinced that, in furtherance of this principle, all Parties to the Treaty are entitled to participate in the fullest possible exchange of scientific information for, and to contribute alone or in co-operation with other States to, the further development of the applications of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, <p>
Declaring their intention to achieve at the earliest possible date the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to undertake effective measures in the direction of nuclear disarmament,<p>
Urging the co-operation of all States in the attainment of this objective,<p>
Recalling the determination expressed by the Parties to the 1963 Treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water in its Preamble to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time and to continue negotiations to this end,<p>
Desiring to further the easing of international tension and the strengthening of trust between States in order to facilitate the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons, the liquidation of all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery pursuant to a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, <p>
Recalling that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, States must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations, and that the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security are to be promoted with the least diversion for armaments of the world's human and economic resources,<p>
Have agreed as follows:<p>
<h2><a name="article_i">Article I</a></h2><p>
Each nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; and not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such weapons or explosive devices.<p>
<h2><a name="article_ii">Article II<p></a></h2>
Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.<p>
<h2><a name="article_iii">Article III</a></h2>
1.	Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes to accept safeguards, as set forth in an agreement to be negotiated and concluded with the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Agency's safeguards system, for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfilment of its obligations assumed under this Treaty with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Procedures for the safeguards required by this Article shall be followed with respect to source or special fissionable material whether it is being produced, processed or used in any principal nuclear facility or is outside any such facility. The safeguards required by this Article shall be applied on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of such State, under its jurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere.<p>
2.	Each State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide: <p>
	(a) source or special fissionable material, or <p>
	(b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article.<p>
3.	The safeguards required by this Article shall be implemented in a manner designed to comply with Article IV of this Treaty, and to avoid hampering the economic or technological development of the Parties or international co-operation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, including the international exchange of nuclear material and equipment for the processing, use or production of nuclear material for peaceful purposes in accordance with the provisions of this Article and the principle of safeguarding set forth in the Preamble of the Treaty.<p>
4.	Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty shall conclude agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency to meet the requirements of this Article either individually or together with other States in accordance with the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Negotiation of such agreements shall commence within 180 days from the original entry into force of this Treaty. For States depositing their instruments of ratification or accession after the 180-day period, negotiation of such agreements shall commence not later than the date of such deposit. Such agreements shall enter into force not later than eighteen months after the date of initiation of negotiations.<p>
<h2><a name="article_iv>Article IV</a></h2>
1.	Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty.<p>
2.	All the Parties to the Treaty undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Parties to the Treaty in a position to do so shall also co-operate in contributing alone or together with other States or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world.<p>
<h2><a name="article_v>Article V</a></h2>
Each Party to the Treaty undertakes to take appropriate measures to ensure that, in accordance with this Treaty, under appropriate international observation and through appropriate international procedures, potential benefits from any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions will be made available to non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty on a non-discriminatory basis and that the charge to such Parties for the explosive devices used will be as low as possible and exclude any charge for research and development. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty shall be able to obtain such benefits, pursuant to a special international agreement or agreements, through an appropriate international body with adequate representation of non-nuclear-weapon States. Negotiations on this subject shall commence as soon as possible after the Treaty enters into force. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty so desiring may also obtain such benefits pursuant to bilateral agreements.<p>
<h2><a name="article_vi">Article VI</a></h2>
Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.<p>
<h2><a name="article_vii"> Article VII</a></h2>

<H1>G.A.P. SEEKS TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER   TO EXPOSE COVER-UP OF NAVY NUCLEAR WASTE    </H1>
<H2>Note: Not a Greenpeace Press Release</H2>
Embargoed From Release Until:  Monday July 10, 1995.    <P>
<P>
The Government Accountability Project (G.A.P.) - the nation's premier  whistleblower protection organization - today 
filed suit against the Department of Transportation in federal court in Washington, D.C., to expose the Coast Guard and 
Navy's cover-up of deadly radioactive material the Navy has been discharging   into the Puget Sound.  For the past ten 
years, the Navy has been decommissioning nuclear  submarines in the Puget Sound.  The Navy is legally required to 
observe strict safety procedures to control for discharges of radioactive material, and has repeatedly assured the public 
that it has complied.   Observations by SEARCH - a non-profit organization devoted to monitoring nuclear activities - 
reveals otherwise.  Further, the Navy has refused to provide data and samples to verify its claims.    <P>
In 1993, SEARCH began collecting its own biological samples from Sinclair Inlet  in Puget Sound.  Analysis of these 
samples has revealed traces of radioactive material in shellfish and other marine life.  The radioactive materials measure 
at levels 50 times greater than the maximum levels allowed by government safety  standards. In order to comply with 
existing regulations in gathering biological samples, SEARCH did not send   a vessel into the restricted area; rather, 
Norman Buske, a SEARCH scientist, took  samples by swimming from a boat located in adjacent waters.  Buske notified 
the Navy in advance of his samplings; on one or more occasions, the Navy vis-a-vis the Coast Guard has escorted Buske 
and used his samples for their own study.    <P>
Concerned about Buske's discoveries of the high levels of radioactive materials  found in marine life, the Navy went on 
the offensive.  On September 22, 1994, the Navy and the Coast Guard had Buske placed under arrest for purportedly 
trespassing on military property.  The vessel which transported Buske, operated by the environmental group Greenpeace, 
was seized and involuntarily towed into restricted waters so that its   personnel could be arrested as well.  When Buske 
entered the area again, he was criminally prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle, Washington.      <P>
The case against Buske was thrown out of federal court by the judge, who found  that this "area is not the property of the 
United States" and that Buske posed no threat to security or safety of government operations in Puget Sound.  In June, 
Buske resumed his sampling, accompanied by government representatives.  In an effort to stem any further revelations, 
the local Coast Guard office published an emergency rule aimed solely at   preventing Buske from taking any further 
samples.  It then threatened Buske with another  arrest, and refused his personal request for access.    <P>
The suit filed today on behalf of Buske and SEARCH by G.A.P. aims to restrain  the government from  continuing to 
interfere with SEARCH's right to freely investigate and speak out about the Navy's dangerous and unlawful discharges of 
radioactive material.    For more information or to request a copy of the filing contact:    <P>

Subject:          press release<P>
 I am Tom Carpenter, an attorney with the non-profit organization called Government Accountability Project (GAP).  
GAP represents environmental whistleblowers, with our Northwest work focussing primarily on Hanford and on  the oil 
pipeline in Alaska.  We also defend forest service employees (in conjunction with AFSEE and PEER), and EPA 
employees nationwide. I am enclosing a press release relating to radioactive pollution in the Puget Sound, and our filing 
of a lawsuit on behalf of SEARCH, a non-profit eco-sleuthing group that is attempting to get access to restricted Navy 
waters to investigate high radiation levels found in earlier samplings. <P>
Note that this action involved a Greenpeace Zodiac which was illegally towed into restricted waters for the sole purpose 
of arresting the activists on board and to confiscate the samples collected by SEARCH. I would appreciate your posting 
of this press release - - the complaint and accompanying brief and affidavit can easily be made available electronically, 
and I am happy to do so.  Thanks in advance if you can help.<P>

The Parties to this Convention, <P>
<I>Acknowledging</I> that change in the Earth's climate and its adverse effects are a common 
concern of humankind,  <P>
<I>Concerned</I> that human activities have been substantially increasing the atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases, that these increases enhance the natural greenhouse effect, 
and that this will result on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface and atmosphere 
and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and humankind, <P>
<I>Noting</I> that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse 
gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are 
still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will 
grow to meet their social and development needs,<P>
<I>Aware</I> of the role and importance in terrestrial and marine ecosystems of sinks and 
reservoirs of greenhouse gases, <P>
<I>Noting</I> that there are many uncertainties in predictions of climate change, particularly 
with regard to the timing, magnitude and regional patterns thereof, <P>
<I>Acknowledging</I> that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible 
cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international 
response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities and their social and economic conditions,<P>
<I>Recalling</I> the pertinent provisions of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference 
on the Human Environment, adopted at Stockholm on 16 June 1972,<P>
<I>Recalling</I> also that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and 
the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to 
their own environmentaland developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities 
within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of 
areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,<P>
<I>Reaffirming</I> the principle of sovereignty of States in international cooperation to address 
climate change,<P>
<I>Recognizing</I> that States should enact effective environmental legislation,that 
environmental standards, management objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental 
and developmental context to which they apply, and that standards applied by some countries may 
be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular 
developing countries,<P>
<I>Recalling</I> the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/228 of 22 December 1989 
on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and resolutions 43/53 of 6 
December 1988, 44/207 of 22 December 1989, 45/212 of 21 December 1990 and 46/169 of 19 
December 1991 on protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind,<P>
<I>Recalling</I> also the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/206 of 22  December 
1989 on the possible adverse effects of sea level rise on islands and coastal areas, particularly low-
lying coastal areas and the pertinent provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/172 of 19 
December 1989 on the implementation of the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification, <P>
<I>Recalling</I> further the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, 1985, 
and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 1987, as adjusted and 
amended on 29 June 1990,  <P>
<I>Noting</I> the Ministerial Declaration of the Second World Climate Conference adopted on 
7 November 1990, <P>
<I>Conscious</I> of the valuable analytical work being conducted by many States on climate 
change and of the important contributions of the World Meteorological Organization, the United 
Nations Environment Programme and other organs, organizations and bodies of the United 
Nations system, as well as other international and intergovernmental bodies, to the exchange of 
results of scientific research and the coordination of research,  <P>
<I>Recognizing</I> that steps required to understand and address climate change will be 
environmentally, socially and economically most effective if they are based on relevant scientific, 
technical and economic considerations and continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in 
these areas,<P>
<I>Recognizing</I> that various actions to address climate change can be justified economically 
in their own right and can also help in solving other environmental problems, <P>
<I>Recognizing</I> also the need for developed countries to take immediate action in a flexible 
manner on the basis of clear priorities, as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies at 
the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels that take into account all greenhouse gases, 
with due consideration of their relative contributions to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect, 
<P>
<I>Recognizing</I> further that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with low-
lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, and 
developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the 
adverse effects of climate change, <P>
<I>Recognizing</I> the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, 
whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation, as a 
consequence of action taken on limiting greenhouse gas emissions,<P>
<I>Affirming</I> that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and 
economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the 
latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the 
achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty, <P>
<I>Recognizing</I> that all countries, especially developing countries, need access to resources 
required to achieve sustainable social and economic development and that, in order for developing 
countries to progress towards that goal, their energy consumption will need to grow taking into 
account the possibilities for achieving greater energy efficiency and for controlling greenhouse 
gas emissions in general, including through the application of new technologies on terms which 
make such an application economically and socially beneficial, <P>
<I>Determined</I> to protect the climate system for present and future generations,<P>
Have agreed as follows:<P>
<H3>Article 1     Defin<A NAME = Definitions></A>itions *</H3>
[ *  Titles of articles are included solely to assist the reader.]<P>
For the purposes of this Convention:<P>
1.     "Adverse effects of climate change" means changes in the physical environment or biota 
resulting from climate change which have significant deleterious effects on the composition, 
resilience or productivity of natural and managed ecosystems or on the operation of socio-
economic systems or on human health and welfare.<P>
2.     "Climate change" means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to 
human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition 
to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.<P>
3.     "Climate system" means the totality of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and 
geosphere and their interactions. <P>
4.     "Emissions" means the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the 
atmosphere over a specified area and period of time.<P>
5.     "Greenhouse gases" means those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and 
anthropogenic, that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation.<P>
6.     "Regional economic integration organization" means an organization constituted by 
sovereign States of a given region which has competence in respect of matters governed by 
this Convention or its protocols and has been duly authorized, in accordance with its internal 
procedures, to sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to the instruments concerned.<P>
7.     "Reservoir" means a component or components of the climate system where a greenhouse 
gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored.<P>
8.     "Sink" means any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an 
aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. <P>
9.     "Source" means any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a 
precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.<P>
<H3>Article 2     Objec<A NAME = Objective></A>tive</H3>
The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of 
the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, 
stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent 
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  Such a level should be achieved 
within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure 
that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a 
sustainable manner.<P>
<H3>Article 3      Princi<A NAME = Principles></A>ples</H3>
In their actions to achieve the objective of the Convention and to implement its provisions, the 
Parties shall be guided, <I>inter alia</I>, by the following: <P>
1.     The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future 
generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but 
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  Accordingly, the developed 
country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects 
thereof.<P>
2.     The specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those 
that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those Parties, 
especially developing country Parties, that would have to bear a disproportionate or 
abnormal burden under the Convention, should be given full consideration.<P>
3.     The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the 
causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects.  Where there are threats of serious 
or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for 
postponing such measures, taking into account that policies and measures to deal with 
climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible 
cost.  To achieve this, such policies and measures should take into account different socio-
economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of 
greenhouse gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors.  Efforts to address 
climate change may be carried out cooperatively by interested Parties.<P>
4.     The Parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development.  Policies and 
measures to protect the climate system against human-induced change should be appropriate 
for the specific conditions of each Party and should be integrated with national development 
programmes, taking into account that economic development is essential for adopting 
measures to address climate change.<P>
5.     The Parties should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic 
system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development in all Parties, 
particularly developing country Parties, thus enabling them better to address the problems of 
climate change.  Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should 
not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction 
on international trade.<P>
<H3>Article 4     Commi<A NAME = Commitments></A>tments</H3>
1.     All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their 
specific national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances, 
shall:<P>
(a)     Develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the Conference of the 
Parties, in accordance with <A HREF = "#CommofInforeImplementation">Article 
12</A>, national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by 
sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, using 
comparable methodologies to be agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties;<P>
(b)     Formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where appropriate, 
regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change by addressing 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not 
controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to 
climate change;<P>
(c)     Promote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, including 
transfer, of technologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent 
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol 
in all relevant sectors, including the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry 
and waste management sectors;<P>
(d)     Promote sustainable management, and promote and cooperate in the conservation and 
enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not 
controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including biomass, forests and oceans as well as 
other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems;<P>
(e)     Cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change; develop and 
elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone management, water 
resources and agriculture, and for the protection and rehabilitation of areas, 
particularly in Africa, affected by drought and desertification, as well as floods; <P>
(f)     Take climate change considerations into account, to the extent feasible, in their 
relevant social, economic and environmental policies and actions, and employ 
appropriate methods, for example impact assessments, formulated and determined 
nationally, with a view to minimizing adverse effects on the economy, on public 
health and on the quality of the environment, of projects or measures undertaken by 
them to mitigate or adapt to climate change;<P>
(g)     Promote and cooperate in scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and 
other research, systematic observation and development of data archives related to the 
climate system and intended to further the understanding and to reduce or eliminate 
the remaining uncertainties regarding the causes, effects, magnitude and timing of 
climate change and the economic and social consequences of various response 
strategies;<P>
(h)     Promote and cooperate in the full, open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific, 
technological, technical, socio-economic and legal information related to the climate 
system and climate change, and to the economic and social consequences of various 
response strategies;<P>
(i)     Promote and cooperate in education, training and public awareness related to climate 
change and encourage the widest participation in this process, including that of non-
governmental organizations; and<P>
(j)     Communicate to the Conference of the Parties information related to implementation, 
in accordance with <A HREF = "#CommofInforeImplementation">Article 
12</A>.<P>
2.     The developed country Parties and other Parties included in annex I commit themselves 
specifically as provided for in the following:<P>
(a)     Each of these Parties shall adopt national policies and take corresponding measures on 
the mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of 
greenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its greenhouse gas sinks and 
reservoirs.  These policies and measures will demonstrate that developed countries are 
taking the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent 
with the objective of the Convention, recognizing that the return by the end of the 
present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol would contribute to 
such modification, and taking into account the differences in these Parties' starting 
points and approaches, economic structures and resource bases, the need to maintain 
strong and sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual 
circumstances, as well as the need for equitable and appropriate contributions by each 
of these Parties to the global effort regarding that objective.  These Parties may 
implement such policies and measures jointly with other Parties and may assist other 
Parties in contributing to the achievement of the objective of the Convention and, in 
particular, that of this subparagraph;<P>
(b)     In order to promote progress to this end, each of these Parties shall communicate, 
within six months of the entry into force of the Convention for it and periodically 
thereafter, and in accordance with <A HREF = 
"#CommofInforeImplementation">Article 12</A> , detailed information on its 
policies and measures referred to in subparagraph (a) above, as well as on its resulting 
projected anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse 
gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol for the period referred to in 
subparagraph (a), with the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels 
these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not 
controlled by the Montreal Protocol.  This information will be reviewed by the 
Conference of the Parties, at its first session and periodically thereafter, in accordance 
with <A HREF = "#ConferenceoftheParties">Article 7</A> ; <P>
   (c) Calculations of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases for 
the purposes of subparagraph (b) above should take into account the best available 
scientific knowledge, including of the effective capacity of sinks and the respective 
contributions of such gases to climate change.  The Conference of the Parties shall 
consider and agree on methodologies for these calculations at its first session and 
review them regularly thereafter;<P>
(d)     The Conference of the Parties shall, at its first session, review the adequacy of 
subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.  Such review shall be carried out in the light of the 
best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its 
impacts, as well as relevant technical, social and economic information.  Based on this 
review, the Conference of the Parties shall take appropriate action, which may include 
the adoption of amendments to the commitments in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.  
The Conference of the Parties, at its first session, shall also take decisions regarding 
criteria for joint implementation as indicated in subparagraph (a) above.  A second 
review of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall take place not later than 31 December 1998, 
and thereafter at regular intervals determined by the Conference of the Parties, until 
the objective of the Convention is met;<P>
(e)     Each of these Parties shall :<P>
(i)     coordinate as appropriate with other such Parties, relevant economic and 
administrative instruments developed to achieve the objective of the 
Convention; and<P>
(ii)     identify and periodically review its own policies and practices which encourage 
activities that lead to greater levels of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse 
gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol than would otherwise occur;<P>
(f)     The Conference of the Parties shall review, not later than 31 December 1998, 
available information with a view to taking decisions regarding such amendments to 
the lists in annexes I and II as may be appropriate, with the approval of the Party 
concerned;<P>
3.     The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in annex II shall 
provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by 
developing country Parties in complying with their obligations under <A HREF = 
"#CommofInforeImplementation">Article 12</A> , paragraph 1. They shall also provide 
such financial resources, including for the transfer of technology, needed by the developing 
country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures that are 
covered by paragraph 1 of this Article and that are agreed between a developing country 
Party and the international entity or entities referred to in <A HREF = 
"#FinancialMechanism">Article 11</A> , in accordance with that Article. The 
implementation of these commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy and 
predictability in the flow of funds and the importance of appropriate burden sharing among 
the developed country Parties.<P>
4.     The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in annex II shall also 
assist the developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of 
climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects. <P>
5.     The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in annex II shall take all 
practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access 
to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly 
developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention.  
In this process, the developed country Parties shall support the development and 
enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties.  
Other Parties and organizations in a position to do so may also assist in facilitating the 
transfer of such technologies.<P>
6.     In the implementation of their commitments under paragraph 2 above, a certain degree of 
flexibility shall be allowed by the Conference of the Parties to the Parties included in annex 
I undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, in order to enhance the ability 
of these Parties to address climate change, including with regard to the historical level of 
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol 
chosen as a reference.<P>
7.     The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their 
commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by 
developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial 
resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and 
social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the 
developing country Parties.<P>
8.     In the implementation of the commitments in this Article, the Parties shall give full 
consideration to what actions are necessary under the Convention, including actions related 
to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology, to meet the specific needs and concerns 
of developing country Parties arising from the adverse effects of climate change and/or the 
impact of the implementation of response measures, especially on:<P>
(a)     Small island countries;<P>
(b)     Countries with low-lying coastal areas;<P>
(c)     Countries with arid and semi-arid areas, forested areas and areas liable to forest 
decay;<P>
(d)     Countries with areas prone to natural disasters;<P>
(e)     Countries with areas liable to drought and desertification;<P>
(f)     Countries with areas of high urban atmospheric pollution;<P>
(g)     Countries with areas with fragile ecosystems, including mountainous ecosystems;<P>
(h)     Countries whose economies are highly dependent on income generated from the 
production, processing and export, and/or on consumption of fossil fuels and 
associated energy-intensive products; and<P>
(i)     Land-locked and transit countries.<P>
Further, the Conference of the Parties may take actions, as appropriate, with respect to this 
paragraph.<P>
9.     The Parties shall take full account of the specific needs and special situations of the least 
developed countries in their actions with regard to funding and transfer of technology.<P>
10.     The Parties shall, in accordance with <A HREF = 
"#SubsidBodyforImplementation">Article 10</A> take into consideration in the 
implementation of the commitments of the Convention the situation of Parties, particularly 
developing country Parties, with economies that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of the 
implementation of measures to respond to climate change.  This applies notably to Parties 
with economies that are highly dependent on income generated from the production, 
processing and export, and/or consumption of fossil fuels and associated energy-intensive 
products and/or the use of fossil fuels for which such Parties have serious difficulties in 
switching to alternatives.<P>

4. The following chemical substances of natural and anthropogenic origin, not listed in order of 
priority, are thought to have the potential to modify the chemical and physical properties of the 
ozone layer. <P>
(a) Carbon substances<P>
(i) Carbon monoxide (CO)<P>
Carbon monoxide has significant natural and anthropogenic sources, and is thought to play a 
major direct role in tropospheric  photochemistry, and an indirect role in stratospheric 
photochemistry.  <P>
(ii) Carbon dioxide (CO2)<P>
Carbon dioxide has significant natural and anthropogenic sources, and  affects stratospheric 
ozone by influencing the thermal structure of  the atmosphere.<P>
(iii) Methane (CH4)<P>
Methane has both natural and anthropogenic sources, and affects both  tropospheric and 
stratospheric ozone.<P>
(iv) Non-methane hydrocarbon species<P>
Non-methane hydrocarbon species, which consist of a large number of  chemical substances, 
have both natural and anthropogenic sources, and  play a direct role in tropospheric 
photochemistry and an indirect  role in stratospheric photochemistry.<P>
(b) Nitrogen substances<P>
(i) Nitrous oxide (N2O)<P>
The dominant sources of N2O are natural, but anthropogenic  contributions are becoming 
increasingly important. Nitrous oxide is  the primary source of stratospheric NOx, which play a 
vital role in  controlling the abundance of stratospheric ozone. (ii) Nitrogen oxides (NOx)<P>
Ground-level sources of NOx play a major direct role only in  tropospheric photochemical 
processes and an indirect role in  stratosphere photochemistry, whereas injection of NOx close 
to the  tropopause may lead directly to a change in upper tropospheric and  stratospheric 
ozone.<P>
(c) Chlorine substances<P>
(i) Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CCl4, CFCl3 (CFC-11), CF2Cl2  (CFC-12), C2F3Cl3 (CFC-
113), C2F4Cl2 (CFC-114)<P>
Fully halogenated alkanes are anthropogenic and act as a source of  ClOx, which plays a vital 
role in ozone photochemistry, especially in  the 30-50 km altitude region.<P>
(ii) Partially halogenated alkanes, e.g. CH3Cl, CHF2Cl (CFC-22),  CH3CCl3, CHFCl2 (CFC-
21)<P>
The sources of CH3Cl are natural, whereas the other partially  halogenated alkanes mentioned 
above are anthropogenic in origin.<P>
These gases also act as a source of stratospheric ClOx.  (d) Bromine substances<P>
Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CF3Br<P>
These gases are anthropogenic and act as a source of BrOx, which  behaves in a manner similar 
to ClOx.<P>
(e) Hydrogen substances<P>
(i) Hydrogen (H2)<P>
Hydrogen, the source of which is natural and anthropogenic, plays a  minor role in stratospheric 
photochemistry.<P>
(ii) Water (H2O)<P>
Water, the source of which is natural, plays a vital role in both  tropospheric and stratospheric 
photochemistry. Local sources of water  vapour in the stratosphere include the oxidation of 
methane and, to a  lesser extent, of hydrogen.<P>

twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled 
substances in Group I of <A HREF = "#Annex_A">Annex A</A> does not exceed, 
annually, eighty percent of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party 
producing one or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its 
calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed, annually, eighty per cent 
of its calculated level of production in 1986. However, in order to satisfy the basic 
domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5  and for the purposes of industrial 
rationalization between Parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by 
up to ten per cent of its calculated level of production in 1986.<P>
4.     Each Party shall ensure that for the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, and in each

of its calculated level of production in 1986. However, in order to satisfy the basic 
domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial 
rationalization between Parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by 
up to fifteen per cent of its calculated level of production in 1986. This paragraph will 
apply unless the Parties decide otherwise at a meeting by a two-thirds majority of Parties 
present and voting, representing at least two-thirds of the total calculated level of 
consumption of these substances of the Parties. This decision shall be considered and 
made in the light of the assessments referred to in <A HREF = 
"#AssessmentandReviewofControlMeasures">Article 6</A>.<P>

<H3><A NAME=Preamble></A>Preamble</H3>
The Parties to this Convention,<P>
<I>Aware</I> of the risk of damage to human health and the environment caused by hazardous 
wastes and other wastes and the transboundary movement thereof,<P>
<I>Mindful </I>of the growing threat to human health and the environment posed by the 
increased generation and complexity, and transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other 
wastes,<P>
<I>Mindful</I> <I>also</I> that the most effective way of protecting human health and the 
environment from the dangers posed by such wastes is the reduction of their generation to a 
minimum in terms of quantity and/or hazard potential,<P>
<I>Convinced</I> that States should take necessary measures to ensure that the management of 
hazardous wastes and other wastes including their transboundary movement and disposal is 
consistent with the protection of human health and the environment whatever the place of their 
disposal,<P>
<I>Noting</I> that States should ensure that the generator should carry out duties with regard to 
the transport and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes in a manner that is consistent with 
the dprotection of the environment, whatever the place of disposal,<P>
<I>Fully recognizing</I> that any State has the sovereign right to ban the entry or disposal of 
foreign hazardous wastes and other wastes in its territory,<P>
<I>Recognizing</I> <I>also</I> the increasing desire for the prohibition of transboundary 
movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal in other States, especially developing 
countries,<P>
<I>Convinced</I> that hazardous wastes and other wastes should, as far as is compatible with 
environmentally sound and efficient management, be disposed of in the State where they were 
generated,<P>
<I>Aware</I> <I>also</I> that transboundary movements of such wastes from the State of their 
generation to any other State should be permitted only when conducted under conditions which do 
not endanger human health and the environment, and under conditions in conformity with the 
provisions of this Convention,<P>
<I>Considering</I> that enhanced control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and 
other wastes will act as an incentive for their environmentally sound management and for the 
reduction of the volume of such transboundary movement,<P>
<I>Convinced</I> that States should take measures for the proper exchange of information on 
and control of the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes from and to 
those States,<P>
<I>Noting</I> that a number of international and regional agreements have addressed the issue 
of protection and preservation of the environment with regard to the transit of dangerous 
goods,<P>
<I>Taking into account</I> the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment (Stockholm, 1972), the Cairo Guidelines and Principles for the Environmentally 
Sound Management of Hazardous Wastes adopted by the Governing Council of the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by decision 14/30 of 17 June 1987, the 
Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous 
Goods (formulated in 1957 and updated biennially), relevant recommendations, declarations, 
instruments and regulations adopted within the United Nations system and the work and studies 
done within other international and regional organizations,<P>
<I>Mindful</I> of the spirit, principles, aims and functions of the World Charter for Nature 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its thirty-seventh session (1982) as the 
rule of ethics in respect of the protection of the human environment and the conservation of 
natural resources,<P>
<I>Affirming</I> that States are responsible for the fulfilment of their international obligations 
concerning the protection of human health and protection and preservation of the environment, 
and are liable in accordance with international law,<P>
<I>Recognizing</I> that in the case of a material breach of the provisions of this Convention or 
any protocol thereto the relevant international law of treaties shall apply,<P>
<I>Aware</I> of the need to continue the development and implementation of environmentally 
sound low-waste technologies, recycling options, good house-keeping and management systems 
with a view to reducing to a minimum the generation of hazardous wastes and other wastes,<P>
<I>Aware</I> <I>also</I> of the growing international concern about the need for stringent 
control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, and of the need as far 
as possible to reduce such movement to a minimum,<P>
<I>Concerned</I> about the problem of illegal transboundary traffic in hazardous wastes and 
other wastes,<P>
<I>Taking</I> <I>into account also</I> the limited capabilities of the developing countries to 
manage hazardous wastes and other wastes, <P>
<I>Recognizing</I> the need to promote the transfer of technology for the sound management of 
hazardous wastes and other wastes produced locally, particularly to the developing countries in 
accordance with the spirit of the Cairo Guidelines and decision 14/16 of the Governing Council of 
UNEP on Promotion of the transfer of environmental protection technology,<P>
<I>Recognizing</I> <I>also</I> that hazardous wastes and other wastes should be transported 
in accordance with relevant international conventions and recommendations<P>
<I>Convinced</I> <I>also</I> that the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other 
wastes should be permitted only when the transport and the ultimate disposal of such wastes is 
environmentally sound, and<P>
<I>Determined</I> to protect, by strict control, human health and the environment against the 
adverse effects which may result from the generation and management of hazardous wastes and 
other wastes,<P>

1     H1     Explosive<BR>
An explosive substance or waste is a solid or liquid substance or waste (or mixture of substances 
or wastes) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature 
and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to the surroundings<P>
3     H3     Flammable liquids<BR>
The word "flammable" has the same meaning as "inflammable". Flammable liquids are liquids, or 
mixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (for example, paints, 
varnishes, lacquers, etc., but not including substances or wastes otherwise classified on account of 
their dangerous characteristics) which give off a flammable vapour at temperatures of not more 
than 60.5 deg. C, closed-cup test, or not more than 65.6 deg C, open-cup test. (Since the results of 
open-cup tests and of closed-cup tests are not strictly comparable and even individual results by 
the same test are often variable, regulations varying from the above figures to make allowance for 
such differences would be within the spirit of this definition.)<P>
4.1     H4.1     Flammable solids<BR>
Solids, or waste solids, other than those classed as explosives, which under conditions 
encountered in transport are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through 
friction.<P>
4.2     H4.2     Substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion <BR>
Substances or wastes which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions 
encountered in transport, or to heating up on contact with air, and being then liable to catch 
fire.<P>
4.3     H4.3     Substances or wastes which, in contact with water emit flammable 
gases <BR>
Substances or wastes which, by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously 
flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities.<P>
5.1     H5.1     Oxidizing<BR>
Substances or wastes which, while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may, generally by 
yielding oxygen cause, or contribute to, the combustion of other materials.<P>
5.2     H5.2     Organic Peroxides <BR>
Organic substances or wastes which contain the bivalent-o-o-structure are thermally unstable 
substances which may undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition<P>
6.1     H6.1     Poisonous (Acute)<BR>
Substances or wastes liable either to cause death or serious injury or to harm human health if 
swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact.<P>
6.2     H6.2     Infectious substances<BR>
Substances or wastes containing viable micro organisms or their toxins which are known or 
suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.<P>
8     H8     Corrosives<BR>
Substances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact with 
living tissue, or, in the case of leakage, will materially damage, or even destroy, other goods or the 
means of transport; they may also cause other hazards.<P>
9     H10     Liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water<BR>
Substances or wastes which, by interaction with air or water, are liable to give off toxic gases in 
dangerous quantities.<P>
9     H11     Toxic (Delayed or chronic)<BR>
Substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may 
involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity.<P>
9     H12     Ecotoxic<BR>
Substances or wastes which if released present or may present immediate or delayed adverse 
impacts to the environment by means of bioaccumulation and/or toxic effects upon biotic 
systems.<P>
9     H13     Capable, by any means, after disposal, of yielding another 
material, e.g., leachate, which possesses any of the characteristics listed above.<P>
*Corresponds to the hazard classification system included in the United Nations 
Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (ST/SG/ AC.10/1/Rev.5, United 
Nations, New York, 1988).<P>
<U>Tests</U><P><U>
</U>The potential hazards posed by certain types of wastes are not yet fully documented; tests to 
define quantitatively these hazards do not exist.  Further research is necessary in order to develop 
means to characterize potential hazards posed to man and/or the environment by these wastes.  
Standardized tests have been derived with respect to pure substances and materials. Many 
countries have developed national tests which can be applied to materials listed in Annex 1, in 
order to decide if these materials exhibit any of the characteristics listed in this Annex.  <P>

<I>Rule 44</I><P><I>
</I>A motion is considered to be an amendment to a proposal if it merely adds to, deletes from, or revises parts of that 
proposal. An amendment shall be voted on before the proposal to which it relates is put to the vote, and if the amendment is 
adopted, the amended proposal shall then be voted on.<P>

the proposer of a proposal or of an amendment to a proposal to explain his vote on his own proposal or amendment, except if it 
has been amended.<P>

equally divided, the President shall decide between the candidates by drawing lots.<P>
2. 	In the case of a tie in the first ballot among three or more candidates obtaining the largest number of

the procedure set forth in paragraph 1 of this rule.<P>
<I>Rule 51</I><P><I>

of votes and a majority of the votes cast by the Parties present and voting shall be deemed 
elected.<P>
2. 	If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or 
delegations to be elected, there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places, the voting 
being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot, to a 
number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled, provided that, after the third 
inconclusive ballot, votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation.<P>
3. 	If three such unrestricted ballots are inconclusive, the next three ballots shall be restricted to the 
candidates who obtained the greatest number of votes in the third of the unrestricted ballots, to a 
number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled, and the following three ballots 
thereafter shall be unrestricted, and so on until all the places have been filled.<P>

(a) <U>Comments on the</U> <U>provisional Framework Document</U><P>
1. Further consultation required on the future relevant priorities to be taken into account for the different waste 
management options and activities.<P>
2. Future technical guidelines should address economic aspects of different proposed disposal and recovery 
operations as well as preventive measures.<P>
(b) <U>Comments on the</U> <U>provisional Technical Guidelines</U><P>
The following issues were identified by several States and interest groups as deserving particular attention in 
comments to be provided on the provisional technical guidelines.<P>
1. A regulatory and enforcement infrastructure is essential to ensure observance of the guidelines.<P>
2. The vital role of the development and adoption of clean technologies must not be<B> </B>underplayed or 
downvalued. Guidelines should emphasize the importance of technology and environmental audits, rapid 
implementation of new approaches, substitution of technologies and raw materials, product life cycle analyses 
etc.<P><B>
</B>3. Waste management facilities of all sorts should be in the hands of technically competent, trained 
persons.<P>
4. The principles set out in the draft guidelines provide a preliminary indication of available approaches to the 
management of waste. Options identified for waste streams require further consideration as to their long term 
suitability for environmentally sound management. For example, the appropriateness of options D3 and D5 for 
organic solvents, and the allowable level of PCB in waste oils.<P>
5. Guidelines must never be regarded as providing a "once-and-for-all" indication of appropriate action and will 
require regular update in line with developing circumstances. Neither should they be regarded as prescriptive or 
a clear recommendation to use an option in all cases. They provide background information for guidance in 
decision making.<P>
6. Transfer of technology, so as to make available the benefits of developments, must be encouraged.<P>
7. Waste management activities of all types should be critically assessed as to their effectiveness and value by 
consideration of matters such as the input/output mass balance and the receiving environmental media.<P>
8. In any consideration of technical guidelines notice must be taken of available capacity and the capability to 
deal effectively with waste within the areas of each competent authority.<P>

<H1>THE RIO DECLARATION ON 
ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT 
(1992)</H1>
<H1>Preamble</H1>
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development,<P>
Having met at Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992,<P>
Reaffirming the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, adopted at Stockholm on 16 June 1972, and seeking to build upon it,<P>
With the goal of establishing a new and equitable global partnership 
through the creation of new levels of cooperation among States, key sectors of societies and people,<P>
Working towards international agreements which respect the interests of all and protect the integrity of the global environmental and developmental system,<P>
Recognizing the integral and interdependent nature of the Earth, our home,<P>
Proclaims that:<P>
<H2>Principle 1</H2>
Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.  They are entitled to a healthy and 
productive life in harmony with nature.<P>
<H2>Principle 2</H2>
States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the 
sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and 
the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment 
of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.<P>
<H2>Principle 3</H2>
The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present 
and future generations.<P>
<H2>Principle 4</H2>
In order to achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute an integral part of the 
development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it.<P>
<H2>Principle 5</H2>
All States and all people shall cooperate in the essential task of eradicating poverty as an indispensable requirement 
for sustainable development, in order to decrease the disparities in standards of living and better meet the needs of the 
majority of the people of the world.<P>
<H2>Principle 6</H2>
The special situation and needs of developing countries, particularly the least developed and those most 
environmentally vulnerable, shall be given special priority.  International actions in the field of environment and 
development should also address the interests and needs of all countries.<P>
<H2>Principle 7</H2>
States shall cooperate in a spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the 
Earth's ecosystem.  In view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation, States have common 
but differentiated responsibilities.  The developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in the 
international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global 
environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command.<P>
<H2>Principle 8</H2>
To achieve sustainable development and a higher quality of life for all people, States should reduce and eliminate 
unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and promote appropriate demographic policies.<P>
<H2>Principle 9</H2>
States should cooperate to strengthen endogenous capacity-building for sustainable development by improving 
scientific understanding through exchanges of scientific and technological knowledge, and by enhancing the 
development, adaptation, diffusion and transfer of technologies, including new and innovative technologies.<P>
<H2>Principle 10</H2>
Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level.  At the 
national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held 
by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the 
opportunity to participate in decision-making processes.  States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and 
participation by making information widely available.  Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, 
including redress and remedy, shall be provided.<P>
<H2>Principle 11</H2>
States shall enact effective environmental legislation.  Environmental standards, management objectives and 
priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply.  Standards applied by 
some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular 
developing countries.<P>
<H2>Principle 12</H2>
States should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to economic 
growth and sustainable development in all countries, to better address the problems of environmental degradation.  
Trade policy measures for environmental purposes should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable 
discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.  Unilateral actions to deal with environmental 
challenges outside the jurisdiction of the importing country should be avoided.  Environmental measures addressing 
transboundary or global environmental problems should, as far as possible, be based on an international 
consensus.<P>
<H2>Principle 13</H2>
States shall develop national law regarding liability and compensation for the victims of pollution and other 
environmental damage.  States shall also cooperate in an expeditious and more determined manner to develop further 
international law regarding liability and compensation for adverse effects of environmental damage caused by 
activities within their jurisdiction or control to areas beyond their jurisdiction.<P>
<H2>Principle 14</H2>
States should effectively cooperate to discourage or prevent the relocation and transfer to other States of any 
activities and substances that cause severe environmental degradation or are found to be harmful to human 
health.<P>
<H2>Principle 15</H2>
In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their 
capabilities.  Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be 
used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.<P>
<H2>Principle 16</H2>
National authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of environmental costs and the use of economic 
instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, with 
due regard to the public interest and without distorting international trade and investment.<P>
<H2>Principle 17</H2>
Environmental impact assessment, as a national instrument, shall be undertaken for proposed activities that are likely 
to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and are subject to a decision of a competent national 
authority.<P>
<H2>Principle 18</H2>
States shall immediately notify other States of any natural disasters or other emergencies that are likely to produce 
sudden harmful effects on the environment of those States.  Every effort shall be made by the international 
community to help States so afflicted.<P>
<H2>Principle 19</H2>
States shall provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to potentially affected States on activities 
that may have a significant adverse transboundary environmental effect and shall consult with those States at an early 
stage and in good faith.<P>
<H2>Principle 20</H2>
Women have a vital role in environmental management and development.  Their full participation is therefore 
essential to achieve sustainable development.<P>
<H2>Principle 21</H2>
The creativity, ideals and courage of the youth of the world should be mobilized to forge a global partnership in order 
to achieve sustainable development and ensure a better future for all.<P>
<H2>Principle 22</H2>
Indigenous people and their communities, and other local communities, have a vital role in environmental 
management and development because of their knowledge and traditional practices.  States should recognize and 
duly support their identity, culture and interests and enable their effective participation in the achievement of 
sustainable development.<P>
<H2>Principle 23</H2>
The environment and natural resources of people under oppression, domination and occupation shall be 
protected.<P>
<H2>Principle 24</H2>
Warfare is inherently destructive of sustainable development.  States shall therefore respect international law 
providing protection for the environment in times of armed conflict and cooperate in its further development, as 
necessary. <P>
<H2>Principle 25</H2>
Peace, development and environmental protection are interdependent and indivisible.<P>
<H2>Principle 26</H2>
States shall resolve all their environmental disputes peacefully and by appropriate means in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations.<P>
<H2>Principle 27</H2>
States and people shall cooperate in good faith and in a spirit of partnership in the fulfilment of the principles 
embodied in this Declaration and in the further development of international law in the field of sustainable 
development.<P>

2. When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating States and the object and purpose of a treaty that the 
application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be 
bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.<P>
3. When a treaty is a constituent instrument of an international organization and unless it otherwise provides, a 
reservation requires the acceptance of the competent organ of that organization.<P>

(a) acceptance by another contracting State of a reservation constitutes the reserving State a party to the treaty in 
relation to that other State if or when the treaty is in force for those States;<P>

between the objecting and reserving States unless a contrary intention is definitely expressed by the objecting 
State;<P>

after it was notified of the reservation or by the date on which it expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, 
whichever is later.<P>

2. The reservation does not modify the provisions of the treaty for the other parties to the treaty inter se.<P>

has been received by that State; (b) the withdrawal of an objection to a reservation becomes operative only when 
notice of it has been received by the State which formulated the reservation.<P>

1. A reservation, an express acceptance of a reservation and an objection to a reservation must be formulated in 
writing and communicated to the contracting States and other States entitled to become parties to the treaty.<P>
2. If formulated when signing the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, a reservation must be formally 
confirmed by the reserving State when expressing its consent to be bound by the treaty. In such a case the reservation 
shall be considered as having been made on the date of its confirmation.<P>
3. An express acceptance of, or an objection to, a reservation made previously to confirmation of the reservation does 
not itself require confirmation.<P>
4. The withdrawal of a reservation or of an objection to a reservation must be formulated in writing.<P>

<P>In February 1995 a cargo of highly radioactive plutonium 
waste, generated by the La Hague reprocessing plant in 
France, was shipped on board the British-flagged ship, 
the Pacific Pintail, to Japan.    This first ever 
shipment of plutonium waste between Europe and Japan 
contained 28 glassified blocks, some 13,000,000 curies of 
radioactivity.  

<P>The waste transported was so deadly that a person within 
one meter of a single unshielded glass block would 
receive a fatal dose of radiation in less than one 
minute.   

<P>This transport, made in secret by the French, British and 
Japanese governments, caused global public and 
politically condemnation.  Over 40 governments condemned 
the shipment and some even banned it from entering their 
territorial waters.

<P>If all the blocks of plutonium waste are transported at 
the rate of 28 per shipment, over 100 sea shipments will 
be required by the year 2010.  

<P><B>The next shipment between France and Japan is expected to 
be made within the next few months.  More details will be 
made available on this web site in the near future!!!

<P><H3>Gestational and Lactational Exposure of Rats to Xenoestrogens Results in Reduced testicular Size and Sperm Production</H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B>

<P>This study assessed whether exposure of male rats to two estrogenic, environmental chemicals, 
4-octylphenol (OP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) during gestation or during the first 21 days of postnatal life, 
affected testicular size or spermatogenesis in adulthood (90-95 days of age). Chemicals were administered via the drinking water at concentrations of 10-1000 &#181;g/l (OP) or 1000 &#181;g/l (BBP); diethylstilbestrol (DES; 100&#181;g/l) and an octylphenol polyethoxylate (OPP; 1000&#181;g/l), which is a weak estrogen or nonestrogenic <I>in vitro</I>, were administered as presumptive positive and negative controls, respectively. Controls received the vehicle (ethanol) in tapwater. In study 1, rats were treated from 1-22 days after birth; in studies 2 and 3, the mothers were treated for approximately 8-9 weeks, spanning a two week period before mating, throughout gestation and up until 22 days after giving birth.

<P>With the exception of DES, treatment generally had no adverse effect on body weight: in most instances, treated animals were heavier than controls at day 22 at days 90-95.  Exposure to OP, OPP, or BBP at a concentration of 1000 &#181;g/l resulted in a small (5-13%) but significant (<I>p</I><0.01 or <I>p</I><0.001) reduction in mean testicular size in studies 2 and 3,  an effect that was still evident when testicular weight was expressed relative to body weight or kidney weight. This effect of OPP  is attributed to its metabolism <I>in vivo</I> to OP. DES exposure caused similar reductions in testicular size but also caused reductions in body weight, kidney weight and litter size. Ventral prostate weight was reduced significantly in DES-treated rats and to a minor extent in OP-treated rats. Comparable but more minor effects of treatment with DES or OP on testicular size were observed in study 1. None of the treatments had any adverse effect on testicular morphology or on the cross sectional area of the lumen or seminiferous epithelium at stages VII-VIII of the spermatogenic cycle, but DES, OP, and BBP caused reductions of 10-21% (<I>p</I><0.05 to <I>p</I><0.001) in daily sperm production. Humans are exposed to phthalates, such as BBP, and to alkylphenol polyethoxylates, such as OP, but to what extent is unknown. More detailed studies are warranted to asses the possible risk to the development of the human testis from exposure to these and other environmental estrogens.

<P><H3><KBD>Sperm Warning: As male fertility declines, evidence is growing that chemical pollutants are playing hell with our hormones. </KBD></H3>

<P><B>By Geoffrey Lean</B>


<P>MAYBE, in retrospect, we will decide that it was the "gay gulls" - as they came to be called - which gave the first clue that something strange and sinister was happening to life on earth. Back in the early 1970s researchers in California found that female gulls had taken to nesting together. The males had, apparently, lost interest. 

<P>Before long, strange couples were being found all round the United States from the Pacific north-west to Massachusetts. When the reluctant males were caught and examined the story became stranger still. For they were found to have grown female egg-laying canals. 

<P>Or perhaps we will fix on the inadequate alligators. In the late 1980s, scientists trying to find out why few of the reptiles' eggs were hatching at Lake Apopka in Florida found that more than half the males had mysteriously tiny penises. Further research revealed that they had female hormone patterns - and that turtles in the same lake had developed into hermaphrodites. 

<P>Then again, it could be that the warning was really sounded by the Danes. In 1990, experts at Copenhagen University began to wonder why sperm banks were finding it so hard to build up a register of donors. Only one out of every 10 volunteers was producing enough of the stuff to qualify. When they investigated they found that average sperm counts in Denmark and in 19 other countries all over the world had been cut by half in the previous 50 years. There is no sign that the decline has stopped there. 

<P>Growing alarm at these bizarre developments - and many more of the same -will be focused next week on the British publication of a disturbing new book. Our Stolen Future (Little Brown, £18.99), which became an overnight sensation when it was issued in the United States last month, ascribes these and a host of other disorders to a range of man-made substances. 

<P>These substances are now found all over the Earth, from Antarctic sediments to the breast milk of Inuit in the Canadian Arctic, and everywhere in between. They are used in children's toys and beer bottle caps, in pesticides and shoes, in upholstery and rocket fuel. And they contaminate much of what we eat and drink. 

<P>In the foreword, Vice-President Al Gore repeatedly compares the book to Rachel Carson's classic Silent Spring which 30 years ago aroused the world to the dangers of pesticides. He calls it "a critically important book that forces us to ask new questions about the synthetic chemicals that we have spread across this Earth" and adds: "Initial animal and human studies link these chemicals to myriad effects including low sperm counts, infertility, genital deformities, human cancers neurological disorders in children, and developmental and reproductive problems in wildlife."

<P>The prestigious US National Academy of Sciences has set up a special panel to assess the threat and the Administration's Environmental Protection Agency has identified the substances as a top research priority, fearing they could become "a.very serious problem". It is also introducing new rules for testing chemicals for their effects on reproduction. 

<P>Here in Britain, the Chemical Industries Association guardedly agrees that "there is enough evidence to suggest cause for concern", while the Ministry of Agriculture - already in disarray over the BSE crisis - is preparing itself for another outcry. 

<P>The book describes the plummeting sperm counts as "the most dramatic and troubling sign" that the pollution may already have had a major effect. A team led by Niels Skakkebak of Copenhagen University concluded, after examining 61 separate studies covering more than 15,000 men on all five continents, that the average count has fallen from 113 sperm per millilitre of semen in 1940 to 66 million in 1990. 

<P>Some scientists dispute his findings, but more and more are coming to similar conclusions. Most recently, the Medical Research Council reported that the fertility of Scottish men born since 1970 was 25 per cent less than those born in the 1950s, and that sperm counts were declining by about 2 per cent per year. 

<P>Pierre Janouet, a French reproductive biologist who first attacked Skakkebak's work, and then confirmed it through his own research, has said that, at the present rate of decline in the count "it will take 70 or 80 years before it goes to zero". 

<P>THEO COLBORN, a tall, spare, 69-year-old grandmother, makes an unlikely scientific prophet of doom, yet it is her research that has linked the gay gulls, the inadequate alligators and countless other disturbing natural phenomena with falling sperm counts and other human disorders. Our Stolen Future is based on her work and she is one of its three authors - with Dianne Dumanoski, a Boston Globe journalist, and John Peterson Myers, the head of a US environmental foundation. 

<P>A pharmacist and the widow of a Colorado farmer, she decided, at 51, to go back to college because she wanted to "get out from behind the drugstore counter, dishing pills". Armed with a PhD, she ended up nine years ago at Washington's Conservation Foundation, researching the effects of pollution in the Great Lakes. Fish in the lakes had been found to develop cancer and she was trying to find out whether the contamination was causing the disease in people too. 

<P>Her results at first seemed reassuring. There was no sign of  higher rates of cancer in the area than elsewhere in the US. But during her research, she had turned up study after study showing reproductive failure, population declines, behavioural changes and disease in 16 species ranging from eagles to salmon, otters to terns, gulls to turtles. She set out the data on a giant computer spreadsheet. 

<P>As she scanned the screen three common factors stood out. First, all of the most affected species were - like humans - at the top of food chains. Persistent pollutants, which accumulate in fat, build up as each predator eats many prey: thus a herring gull concentrates them 25 million times over. 

<P>Second, mainly young creatures were affected; adult ones were relatively unscathed. And third, Dr Colborn's pharmacological background told her, most of the cases could be linked to disruption of the endocrine system, which she calls the "biological equivalent of the information superhighway". 

<P>The endocrine system carries messages that govern sex and reproduction, regulate behaviour and immune systems, and co-ordinate organs and tissues that work together to keep the body functioning. Hormones play an extremely important part in this process, particularly in the unborn child. They are quite extraordinarily powerful, having effects at concentrations of parts per trillion, the equivalent of one drop of gin in 660 railway tanker trucks of tonic. 

<P>There is increasing evidence that some chemicals act, as the book puts it, as "thugs" on the highway, "sabotaging vital communication". It adds: "They mug the hormone messengers or impersonate them. They jam signals, They scramble messages. They sow disinformation. They wreak all manner of havoc." 

<P>Working from more than 12,000 scientific papers from around the world, Dr Colborn says that at least 51 man-made chemicals have been identified as "hormone disrupters", and that at least half of them are persistently building up in body fat. Some mimic the female hormone, oestrogen. Others block the male hormone, testosterone. Still others break down and eliminate a wide variety of them. 

<P>The best attested is DES, a synthetic chemical designed precisely to imitate oestrogen, long given to pregnant women to try to prevent miscarriages. Babies exposed to it in the womb have grown up with reproductive defects, and the girls are at higher risk of getting vaginal cancer. 

<P>But most of the hormone-disrupting chemicals have taken scientists by surprise, and some are very common. Use of the pesticide DDT was once almost universal, and is still widespread in developing countries. It mimics oestrogen and breaks down into chemicals that attack hormones. 

<P>Nearly one and a half million tons of the extremely persistent PCBs have also been spread around the world - in a host of uses, from paints to pesticides plastics to electrical equipment. Several studies report that infertile men have higher levels of them than normal. 

<P>Dioxins, some of the most toxic of known chemicals, also disrupt hormones: male rats exposed to only a single small dose in the womb have dramatically reduced sperm counts. Several thousand tons of just one herbicide containing them was used every year in the 1970s, to keep down weeds and brush on railway lines, fields and lawns. 

<P>Dioxins, DDT and PCBs all accumulate in body fat. When a mother breast-feeds, the book points out, she passes on chemicals long stored in her fat to her child. It calculates that every day a breast-feeding North American or European baby will receive five times the allowable level of PCBs for adults. But there are so many benefits to babies from breast-feeding that the authors draw back from discouraging it. 

<P>Nowhere is uncontaminated. Some of the most remote places are among the most affected by persistent chemicals, because these are concentrated enormously in food chains on their way there - three million times over, for example, in the fat of an Arctic polar bear. 

<P>Dioxins, PCBs and DDTs have all been tightly regulated or banned for years in many countries, but still persist in the environment and in people. And they are now being joined by new classes of chemicals, also thought to disrupt hormones. 

<P>In 1987 Dr Ana Soto of Tufts Medical School in Boston inspected some scientific plates where she was growing breast cancer cells with differing levels of oestrogen. To her amazement she found the cells were proliferating, even when none of the hormone had been added. Painstaking detective work established that an oestrogen mimicking chemical, nonylphenol - added to polystyrene and PVC to make thern less breakable - was leaching from the plastic used in the test tubes. This was the first sign that plastics previously thought to be inert may also be contributing to  hormone disruption and falling  sperm counts. It was also found  that another plastic, polycarbonate - used in bottling spring water- similarly leached an oestrogen-mimicking chemical.

<P>Concern is growing too over  phthalates, used in PVC and a  wide range of other plastics to  make them more flexible, though  these are little mentioned in  the book. Some 2.7 million tons of them are produced world-wide  each year. They have been found  as far away as in Antarctic sediments and in the air over the great oceans and are thought  says Greenpeace, to be the  world's "most abundant environmental contaminants".
 
<P>Ministry of Agriculture research has found phthalates in British food, from meat to sweets, ice lollies to pasta, dried fruits to cheese - either because they were there originally, or because they have leached into them from wrappings. It accepts that phthalates are "ubiquitous" and can cause reproductive effects in mammals, but says there are "unlikely to be health risks". 

<P>Theo Colborn and her colleagues are not just worried about falling sperm counts and other reproductive changes. They point to evidence linking hormone-disrupting chemicals to breast, testicle and prostate cancers, to endometriosis (a common cause of female infertility), and to damage to the immune system.

<P>But they are most anxious about increasing evidence that the substances damage  the brain in the womb and in early life, causing hyperactivity and aggression. Studies have shown these effects in chidren exposed to PCBs before birth - maybe as many as one in every 20 in America. 

<P>By disrupting hormones and development, say the authors of Our Stolen Future, "these synthetic chemicals may be changing who we become. There may be fates worse than extinction." Nothing is proven. In fact most of the possible damage to humans would be impossible to prove. Because they cannot be subjected to laboratory experiments, there is no way of knowing what doses each person has received, and there are no uncontaminated people on Earth to provide a comparison. 

<P>The book has already provoked furious argument in the US. The chemical industry points out that humanity has long been exposed to natural oestrogen mimicking chemicals in many cereals, vegetables and fruits, without suffering any apparent harm. The authors reply that the species has had time to evolve resistance to these natural sources, but not to the synthetic ones and that imitating oestrogen is only one of the new substances' tricks. They cite strong evidence of damage to animals in laboratory 
experiments, and point out that these are particularly significant as the endocrine systems of mammals are remarkably similar. 

<P>Already authorities are beginning to react. PVC water bottles have been banned in Switzerland, Sweden plans to phase out the plastic, and councils all over Europe have started taking precautions. The Chemical Industries Association promises that it will "immediately take steps", including possible bans, "if research evidence concludes that specific chemicals are causing human reproductive health problems". Al Gore may be right: this week's publication could turn out to be the most significant since Silent Spring.

<P><B>Abstract</B>

<P>Objective - To investigate whether sperm production has changed during the past 16 years in the Toulouse area of France.

<P>Design - Time series analysis of sperm donors' specimens between 1977 and 1992.

<P>Setting - Sperm bank of university hospital in Toulouse, France.

<P>Subjects - 302 healthy fertile men candidate sperm donors more than 20 and up to 45 years old and without any infertile brothers.

<P>Main outcome measure - Spermatozoa concentration.

<P>Results - Donors' mean age at time of donation was 34.05 (SD 5.13), but this increased significantly (P< 0.001) during the study, from 32.4 in 1977 to 36 in 1992.  Mean sperm count of samples was 83.12xl06/ml (SD 68.42xl06/ml).  Sperm concentration was positively linked to the year of donation (Pearson's coefficient r= 0.12, P< 0.05), but this correlation disappeared after adjustment for age of donors (r= 0.09, P> 0.05).

<P>Conclusion - Sperm concentration has not changed with time in the Toulouse area. 

<P><H4><KBD>Key messages</KBD></H4>

<P>Several reports have suggested that sperm production is declining in men.

<P>This decline in sperm count was recently confirmed in the Paris area of France.

<P>We studied sperm production of healthy fertile men in the Toulouse area of south west France.

<P>The men were recruited according to the same selection criteria as in the Parisian study, but, contrary to the Parisian results, the sperm count of the semen samples had remained constant during the past 16 years.

<P>These discrepant findings could be explained by different environmental conditions noted between the two areas.

<P>Semen analyses in 1,283 men from the United states over a 
25-year period: No decline in quality.

<P>Columbia-Presbyterian Medical center; Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and 
Idant Laboratories New York, New York; Cryogenic Laboratories, Roseville, 
Minnesota; and California Cryobank, Inc., Los Angeles, California.

<P>Objective: To determine whether semen quality has changed in the United States over 
the last 25 years.

<P>Design: Retrospective review.

<P>Setting: Three U.S. sperm banks, Cryogenic Laboratories, Inc. (Roseville, 
Minnesota), Idant Laboratories (New York, New York), and California Cryobank, Inc. 
(Los Angeles, California)

<P>Patients: Twelve hundred eighty-three consecutive men who banked sperm before 
vasectomy from 1970 to 1994.
Intervention: None

<P>Main Outcome Measures: Age at sample collection, sperm concentration, volume, 
motility, and days of abstinence before sample collection were determined for each 
man. Linear and multiple regression analyses were used to assess changes in these 
characteristics over time. 

<P>Results: Controlling for effects of age and duration of abstinence, there was a slight 
but significant increase in mean sperm concentration but no change in either motility or 
semen volume over the 25-year period. Both sperm motility and semen volume 
decreased with increasing age at sample collection. Both sperm concentration and 
semen volume increased as a function of duration of abstinence. There were significant 
differences in mean ( ±SEM) sperm concentrations (106 sperm/mL) and motilities 
between the different sperm banks with California lowest (72.7 ± 3.1, 51.4% ± 1.1%, 
respectively), Minnesota higher (100.8 ± 2.9, 56.0% ± 0.5%, respectively), and New 
York highest (131.5 ± 3.5, 58.2% ± 0.5%, respectively).

<P>Conclusions: Our data show no decline in sperm counts over a 25-year period in 
1,283 men who banked sperm before vasectomy in three distinct geographical sites in 
the United States.

<P><H3><KBD>Evidence of deteriorating semen quality in the United Kingdom: birth cohort study in 577 men in Scotland over 11 years.</KBD></H3>

<P><B>Stewart Irvine, Elizabeth Cawood, David Richardson, Eileen MacDonald, John Aitken.</B>


<P><B>Abstract</B>

<P>Objective - To determine whether the quality of semen has changed in a group of over 500 Scottish men born between l951 and 1973.

<P>Design - Retrospective review of data on semen quality collected in a single laboratory over 11 years and according to World Health Organisation guidelines. 

<P>Setting - Programme of gamete biology research funded by Medical Research Council.

<P>Subjects - 577 volunteer semen donors.  Of these, 171 were born before 1959, 120 were born in 1960-4, 171 in 1965-9, and 115 in 1970-4.

<P>Main outcome measures - Conventional criteria of semen quality including semen volume (ml), sperm concentration (106/ml), overall motility (% motile), and total number of sperm in the ejaculate (106), and total number of motile sperm in the ejaculate (106).

<P>Results - When the four birth cohort groups were compared a later year of birth was associated with a lower sperm concentration, a lower total number of sperm in the ejaculate, and a lower number of motile sperm in the ejaculate.  The median sperm concentration fell from 98xl06/ml among donors born before 1959 to 78xl06/ml among donors born after 1970 (P= 0.002).  The total number of sperm in the ejaculate fell from 301xl06 to 214x106 (P= 0.0005), and the total number of motile sperm in the ejaculate fell from 169.7x106 to 129.0x106 (P= 0.0065).

<P>Conclusion - This study provides direct evidence that semen quality is deteriorating, with a later year of birth being significantly associated with a reduced number of sperm in adult life. 

<P><H4><KBD>Key messages</KBD></H4>

<P>This study provides the first evidence that the quality of human semen is deteriorating in the United Kingdom.

<P>When men born in the 1970’s were compared with men born in the 1950’s, the total number of motile sperm in the ejaculate was reduced by almost 25%.

<P>These data confirm previously published data from other countries that semen quality is changing, declining by about 2.1% per year.

<P>Research is urgently required to examine the function as well as the number of sperm and to assess whether these changes are affecting human health and male fertility.

What is the role of science in environmental policy? Is science alone enough to assess environmental risk? How should decisions be made when environmental impacts are often so uncertain?



<P>Greenpeace advocates a precautionary approach to environmental protection. Such an approach requires the use of clean production techniques, innovative solutions and social and consumer change to achieve an ultimate goal of zero discharges of harmful substances to the environment.



<P>Sometimes this approach is called "unscientific", by those who argue that industry should continue to produce whatever it wishes unless there is absolute proof that a given substance is causing environmental harm. Greenpeace argues that this is impossible and dangerous - it has already led to a damaged ozone layer, the growing threat of climate change and the build up of persistent chemicals such as PCBs in marine wildlife.

<P>Research priorities are influenced by political decisions and regulations. Political decisions, particularly on environmental matters, are then informed by that research. This process tends to exclude issues and views that lie outside the regulatory framework. 



<P>There are dangers when politicians or industrialists maintain that decisions are purely scientific, especially when they have determined the research priorities in the first place. What is the relationship between science, policy and public concern about the environment? Should scientists take more responsibility for how their research is framed and used?

<p>Male reproductive health has deteriorated in many countries during the last few decades. In the 1990s, declining semen quality has been reported from Belgium, Denmark, France, and Great Britain. The incidence of testicular cancer has increased during the same time. Incidences of hypospadias and cryptorchidism also appear to be increasing. Similar reproductive problems occur in many wildlife species. There are marked geographic differences in the prevalence of male reproductive disorders. While the reasons for these differences are currently unknown, both clinical and laboratory research suggest that the adverse changes may be inter-related and have a common origin in fetal life or childhood. Exposure of the male fetus to supranormal levels of estrogens, such as diethlylstilbestrol, can result in the above-mentioned reproductive defects. The growing number of reports demonstrating that common environmental contaminants and natural factors possess estrogenic activity presents the working hypothesis that the adverse trends in male reproductive health may be, at least in part, associated with exposure to estrogenic or other hormonally active (e.g.,antiandrogenic) environmental chemicals during fetal and childhood development. An extensive research program is needed to understand the extent of the problem, its underlying etiology, and the development of a strategy for prevention and intervention. - Environ Health Perspect 104(Suppl 4):741-803 (1996) 


<H4>Introduction</H4>

In 1992, a research group at the Department of Growth and Reproduction, the National University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), and the Panum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark, published in the British Medical Journal a metaanalysis of the data from the international literature that revealed a significant decrease in sperm concentration and semen volume in otherwise normal men over the period 1938 to 1990. During the same time period, the incidence of testicular cancer had markedly increased in many countries. These and other observations provided a clue that this apparent decline in male reproductive health might be caused by some common environmental factors. It was recognized that similar abnormalities of the male reproductive system were caused by administration of estrogens during pregnancy in humans and experimental animals; therefore, a hypothesis was put forward that environmental chemicals having estrogenic effects were contributing agents. In particular, it was suggested that fetal exposure to an excess of estrogenic compounds was a key risk factor.

<p>[..................................] 

<H4>General Discussion on the Association between Chemicals in the Environment and Male Reproductive Health</H4> 

<p>The possibility that exposure of humans and wildlife to environmental estrogenic chemicals might result in adverse changes in reproductive development, function and/or behaviour is not particularly new; concern was first expressed two decades ago in relation to DDT. Indeed, the first demonstration that a range of man-made chemicals could be estrogenic when administered to animals stems from 1938 (Dodds EC, Lawson W. Molecular structure in relation to oestrogenic activity. Compounds without phenanthrene nucleus. Proc Royal Soc London 118(series B)222-232 (1938)). The issue has resurfaced because of two new developments. The first is the increasing appearance in the human population of several adverse changes of the sort that researchers predicted might occur if human exposure to environmental estrogens was widespread. The second has been the discovery of many new environmental estrogens to which we are exposed daily. In light of these developments, the foregoing report has re-evaluated the strength of the available information to ascertain whether or not there is real concern for human health stemming from exposure to environmental estrogens, or whether the data are more consistent with a theoretical, but unlikely effect on the human. The following stepwise conclusions have been reached: 

<p>* All of the best evidence available points with some certainty to a rising tide in Europe and many other countries of human male reproductive disorders involving sperm counts (and probably sperm quality), testicular cancer, malformation of the external genitalia, and possibly testicular maldescent. 


<p>* There are insufficient data to prove or disprove that these adverse changes in male reproductive health are the result, wholly or partially, of exposure to environmental estrogens. In addressing this issue, we have identified alarming gaps in our knowledge of the route and levels of human exposure to nonpesticide environmental chemicals. Many of these chemicals have not been evaluated for their reproductive toxicity; even where such studies have been performed, their design and intent were such that they may have failed to exclude delayed effects of the sort that can be induced by estrogen (or other hormone) exposure during development. 

<p>* If the above changes in male reproductive health do result from fetal and/or neonatal exposure to environmental estrogens, then we will not know what the current prevalence in male children is for another 20 to 40 years. This is due to the delay between induction and manifestation of many of the effects, e.g., lowered sperm counts or the development of testicular cancer in adult life. The indications are that these problems are still increasing in incidence in the general population. 

<p>* Based on what is known about the widespread imprinting effects of steroid hormones (androgens and estrogens as well as antagonists of these hormones) when there is exposure during fetal/neonatal development, it is possible that there are other adverse health consequences in man of such exposures of which we are currently unaware, e.g., permanent changes to the immune system, growth, etc. 

<p>* There is enough evidence from a variety of sources to suggest that environmental estrogens have the capacity to induce adverse minor and major reproductive defects in man, but there are inadequate data on the level of actual human exposure to these chemicals, which means that no accurate risk assessment can be made. There are also insufficient animal data to permit such an assessment. 

<p>* Determination of whether environmental estrogens do exert harmful effects in man will probably have to rely on weight of evidence rather than establishment of precise cause and effect. To provide this evidence as accurately as possible, future work should address the problem at several levels, including epidemiology, laboratory animal studies, wildlife studies, more complete identification of estrogenic chemicals (i.e., screening), and accurate assessment of the routes and levels of human exposure to these chemicals. 

<p>* There are substantial differences in the incidence of the reproductive defects, referred to previously, in different countries/races and these also appear to show possible relationships to the incidence of other hormone-dependent diseases of the 
reproductive system (breast, prostate). The etiology of these differences should be explored to ascertain to what extent they reflect ethnic/genetic, lifestyle, or environmental influences. 

<p>* There is an urgent need for a clearer understanding of the hormonal environment of the fetus during the period of male sexual differentiation and development, especially of what mechanisms are present to protect the fetus from maternal estrogens, e.g.,<i>a</i>-fetoproteins, steroid-metabolizing enzymes, etc. Because of the inaccessibility of the human fetus at this stage, these studies will probably have to be undertaken in animals. 

<p>* Investment of resources in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether environmental estrogens pose a health risk to man will have major spin-off in terms of our understanding of fetal and neonatal determinants of disease, the routes and importance of human exposure to nonpesticide environmental chemicals and of the etiology of geographic and ethnic differences in disease.

<p><b>Abstract</b><BR>

<P>Certain chemicals in the environment are estrogenic. The low potencies of these compounds, when studied singly, suggest that they may have little effect on biological systems. The estrogenic potencies of combinations of such chemicals were screened in a simple yeast estrogen system (YES) containing human estrogen receptor (hER). Combinations of two weak environmental estrogens, such as dieldrin, endosulfan, or toxaphene, were 1000 times as potent in hER-mediated transactivation as any chemical alone. Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls shown previously to synergistically alter sexual development in turtles also synergized in the YES. The synergistic interaction of chemical mixtures with the estrogen receptor may have profound environmental implications. These results may represent a previously uncharacterized level of regulation of estrogen-associated responses.

PHTHALATES IN FOOD</KBD></H3>

<B>Summary</B><P>
MAFF's Food Safety Directorate has carried out a survey of the levels of total and individual phthalates in samples of composite fatty foods from the Total Diet Study (TDS). The survey was carried out using stored samples of food that had been collected in 1993. 
<P>
Phthalates were detected in all TDS samples that were analysed. There were considerable differences between the levels of phthalates found in retail samples in a pilot study and the levels found in the TDS samples. The reasons for this are unclear and MAFF will investigate further some of the issues raised by this study. Estimates of average dietary intakes of total phthalates range from. 0.1 to 0.8 mg/person/day and high level (97.5th percentile) dietary intakes of total phthalates range from 0.4 to 1.6 mg/person/day. These are considerably below the Tolerable Daily Intakes set for some of these chemicals. The Department of Health has advised that there are unlikely to be any health risks to consumers from these dietary intakes of individual phthalates. This advice takes account of all available information on the possible effects of phthalates, including recent studies concerning oestrogenic activity. 
<P>
<B>Background</B><P>
Phthalic acid diesters, commonly known as phthalates, are a group of organic chemicals that have a variety of industrial uses, including use as plasticisers in a wide range of household and consumer goods,(2) uses in lubricating oils and uses as carriers for perfumes in cosmetics. The use of phthalates in plastic food packaging is limited, for example, to the manufacture of materials such as some adhesives and some printing inks. Phthalates are no longer used in the manufacture of cling film and most other food contact plastic materials. 
<P>
The release of phthalates to the environment may occur during the production and distribution of phthalates, during the manufacture or use of products in which they are used, or after the dispersal of these products. Although some phthalates occur naturally in coal, crude oil and shale, the contribution of such sources to general environmental levels of phthalates is likely to be insignificant.(3) 
<P>
As a- result of their extensive use and their moderate resistance to degradation, phthalates are widely distributed in the environment and are often found at low levels in food. The toxicity of these substances has been considered by the EC Scientific Committee for Food (SCF), which has established Tolerable Daily Intakes (TDIs) for several of the chemicals in the group. 
<P>
A recent survey by MAFF showed that two phthalates, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), were often present in paper and board packaging and were also present at generally low concentrations (typically less than 10 mg/kg) in foods packaged in paper and board.(4) The concentrations of phthalates in samples of fat analysed in this recent survey would be expected to be lower in the core than at the surface if migration from packaging was the major source of contamination. In over half the samples, the concentrations of the phthalates at the core were about equal to or higher than the concentrations found at the surface. These results suggested that phthalates in food originate at least in part from general environmental contamination. Results from other surveys of milk and milk products,(l) (5) pork fat (6) and fish(7) (8) also indicate that phthalates are present in food from general environmental contamination rather than specific sources such as food packaging. 
<P>
The current survey was conducted to estimate the intakes of total and individual phthalates from the average diet. TDS samples consist of retail food products, prepared as for consumption, then combined in amounts reflecting their relative importance in the average UK diet into twenty composite samples, each one representing a defined food group.(9)(10) Phthalates are fat soluble and therefore only those TDS food groups which make a major contribution to dietary fat intakes were selected for analysis. These were carcass meat, meat products, offals, poultry, eggs, fish, fats & oils, milk, and milk products. 
<P>
A pilot study was undertaken to assess whether the normal preparation and storage of TDS samples may itself introduce phthalate contamination. Concentrations of total phthalates were compared in a selection of fatty food samples purchased from retail outlets in Norwich and split so that one portion of each sample was analysed directly and a second portion was analysed after having been processed in the manner used for regular TDS samples. The pilot study concluded that systematic contamination by phthalates in samples processed in the manner of TDS samples should not occur. 
<P>
<B>Method</B><P> 
All samples were analysed at CSL Food Science Laboratory, Norwich. 
<P>
<B>Identification and determination of individual phthalates</B><P>
Food samples were extracted with diethyl ether/hexane (1:1) (liquid milk samples) or acetone/hexane (1:1) (all other food groups) and were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography then concentrated prior to analysis by gas chromatography/low resolution mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify individual phthalates. The limit of detection of the GC-MS instrument was typically 0.001 mg/kg for individual phthalates. The analytical methodology has only recently been developed and insufficient validation data are available for a robust quantitative measure of repeatability to be given. Further analyses were conducted using gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry to confirm the identities of both major and minor peaks. These showed that some small peaks with relative retention times coincident with those of phthalate standards were, in fact, interfering compounds that had been co-extracted. 
<P>
Concentrations of dipropyl phthalate (DPP), DBP, di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) and DEHP were quantified after appropriate calibration. The presence of five other phthalates (di-iso-propyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dicyclohexyl phthalate, diheptyl phthalate and dinonyl phthalate) could be confirmed by gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry, but these compounds were not quantified. Dicyclohexyl phthalate and phthalates of higher molecular weight (dinonyl, didecyl, diundecyl and didodecyl isomers) were not detected in any of the samples analysed. 
<P>
Some commercially-important phthalate esters, such as di-iso-octyl phthalate (DIOP) are complex mixtures of isomers that are dispersed over a wide range of retention times in capillary column gas chromatography. One sample of carcass meat, two of egg and two of milk were therefore analysed by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation interface, under which conditions the three mixtures of isomers represented by DIOP, di-iso-nonyl phthalate, and di-isodecyl phthalate are each eluted as single peaks, thus allowing total dioctyl, dinonyl and didecyl phthalate concentrations to be established. The limit of detection of the HPLC-MS instrument was of the order of 0.01 mg/kg for each of the mixtures of phthalate isomers. Concentrations of total dioctyl phthalates are given in Table 1. Dinonyl and didecyl phthalates were not detected in any of the samples analysed. 
<P>
<B>Determination of total phthalates</B><P>
Food samples were extracted with diethyl ether/hexane (1:1) (liquid milk samples) or acetonelhexane (1:1) (all other food groups) and phthalates were converted to dimethyl phthalate (DMP) by heating the extracts with methanolic potassium hydroxide solution and then with boron trifluoride/diethyl ether complex. These extracts were then fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
<P>
Preparation and analysis of all of the samples of a particular food type were completed in parallel, in a batch which included five process blank determinations. In all cases, the lower limit at which DMP extracted from samples could be measured securely was set by the presence of DMP in blanks rather than by instrumental sensitivity. The limit of quantification for each commodity was the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the corresponding blanks. Limits of quantification were below 0.2 mg/kg for most food types but were higher for fats and oils (0.24 mg/kg), milk (0.34 mg/kg) and carcass meat (0.41 mg/kg). 
<P>
Quoted results are the mean of duplicate determinations. The average of the differences between duplicate determinations, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding mean ("mean duplicate difference") was below 10% for most commodities but was higher (around 35%) for milk and carcass meat. 
<P>
<B>Results</B><P>
The mean concentrations of individual phthalates and of total phthalates (expressed as DMP) are shown in Table 1. Individual phthalates were measured in two samples of each of carcass meat, poultry, eggs and milk. Total phthalates were determined in ten samples of each of seven food groups (carcass meat, offals, poultry, fish, fats & oils, milk, and milk products) and in two samples of each of eggs and meat products. 
<P>
The most abundant individual phthalate in each of the samples was DEHP. Earlier work had shown that DEHP accounted for 9% - 50% of total phthalate in a survey of retail cows' milk,(l) and the results in this study are broadly comparable. The concentrations of DEHP measured by GC-MS and the total dioctyl phthalate measured by HPLC-MS for samples of carcass meat and eggs were similar, indicating that octyl phthalates other than DEHP were not present in these samples in appreciable quantities. In samples of milk, the total dioctyl phthalate concentration was considerably higher than that of DEHP, indicating contamination with other isomeric forms such as DIOP. 
<P>
In the case of the two milk samples, the total quantity of individual phthalates found, expressed as the equivalent concentration of DMP, exceeded the measured total concentration. The precision and overall uncertainty inherent in the measurement of individual phthalate concentrations may be sufficient to account for this apparent discrepancy. For other commodities, a smaller proportion (2% - 23%) of the measured total was attributable to measured individual compounds. 
<P>
The dietary intakes of phthalates have been estimated for average and high level UK consumers using food consumption data from the dietary and nutritional survey of British adults.(11) Using this method to calculate intakes, dietary intakes of total phthalates, measured and expressed as DMP, were estimated to be 0.8 mg/person/day (mean intake) and 1.6 mg/person/day (high level intake). 
<P>
Intake calculations using the results of analysis of the TDS samples suggested that the largest contributions to both mean and high level intakes are made by carcass meat (about 25%), eggs (about 15%), poultry (about 35%) and milk (about 10%). Individual phthalate esters were determined in two samples of each of these composite food groups. Using the concentrations found in the TDS samples gives estimates of intakes for each of the five individual phthalates quantified within the ranges 0.004 to 0.15 mg/person/day for mean intakes and 0.009 to 0.30 mg/person/day for high level intakes from these four foods (Table 2). 
<P>
<B>Interpretation</B><P>
The levels of phthalates measured in TDS samples are at variance with those found in earlier surveillance(l) and also with levels found in the pilot study, in which retail samples of a range of fatty foods and milk were analysed directly after purchase. Concentrations of phthalates found in the pilot study samples before and after preparation as for consumption are given in Table 3. Using the data on phthalates in retail samples of food (as purchased) for calculating dietary intakes gives an estimate of 0.1 mg/person/day for mean intakes and 0.4 mg/person/day for high level intakes. These are considerably below the estimates of 0.8 and 1.6 mg/person/day for average and high level dietary intakes of phthalates that were made on the basis of concentrations found in the TDS samples. This needs further investigation. 
<P>
The toxicity of those phthalates permitted for use in food contact materials has been considered by the SCF. Sufficient toxicological data were available for the committee to set a TDI of 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight/day for DEHP and a temporary TDI for four of the other phthalates included in this survey: 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day for BBP; 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight for DBP; 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day for dicyclohexyl phthalate; and 0.2 mg/kg bodyweight/day for diethyl phthalate. Less toxicological data are available for the remaining phthalates used in food contact materials. The SCF has recommended a "group restriction" for the sum of these remaining compounds of 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight/day. Unlike the TDI, the group restriction is not a precise measure of potential risk to human health. Instead, it is a precautionary limit set to guide the food contact materials industry and enforcement authorities pending submission of further toxicological data. 
<P>
The measurements of total phthalates found in the Total Diet Study give intake estimates of 0.013 and 0.027 mg/kg bodyweight/day for mean and high level adult consumers. Making a “worst case” assumption that all phthalates might have TDIs as low as DEHP or DBP, which is unlikely, then even high level consumers' total phthalate consumption is well within the lowest TDI of 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight/day. The total phthalate levels found in the pilot study (0.002 and 0.006 mg/kg bodyweight/day for mean and high level consumers, respectively) are even lower at around one-twenty-fifth to one-tenth of this TDI. 
<P>
High level intakes of DEHP were estimated to be 0.30 mg/person/day, which is equivalent to 0.005 mg/kg bodyweight/day for a 60 kg adult. This level of intake is one-tenth of the TDI for this compound. Estimated intakes of BBP and DBP are considerably lower. Therefore consumption of foods containing the levels of phthalates found in the TDS samples would not result in mean or high level consumers exceeding the TDIs for DEHP, BBP and DBP. 
<P>
The TDIs discussed above were set before the recent findings that some phthalates may have oestrogenic activity. Two phthalates, BBP and DBP, appear to have weak oestrogenic activity in vitro.(l2) That is, in “test tube” experiments they triggered some of the same effects as the natural hormone, oestradiol. However, they were about a million times less potent than oestradiol. The plasticisers, di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate and DEHP, were not found to be active. Activity of BBP and DBP in vitro is not necessarily evidence that they will be active in the human body. To date only one of these phthalates, BBP, has been tested in laboratory rodents.(l3) Female rats were given BBP at a fixed concentration of 1 mg/l in their drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation. Resulting intakes were estimated to range from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg bodyweight/day during the treatment period. This was reported to cause small reductions in testis weight and sperm production in the male offspring, who would have been exposed to BBP via the mother during the entirety of their most vulnerable period of testis development. These studies suggest that BBP and DBP may have weak oestrogenic activity but at this stage the data are very tentative and no firm conclusions can be drawn. Studies to confirm these effects and to establish a no-effect level would be needed. 
<P>
Considering the individual phthalate measurements for BBP and DBP, and summing the high level consumer intakes, gives a combined estimated intake of 0.00085 mg/kg bodyweight/day. This is more than one-hundred fold below the dose range said to cause minimal effects in developing rodents. The Department of Health has advised that there are unlikely to be any health risks to consumers from the levels of individual or total phthalates found in the TDS samples.

Notes: These data give the dietary intakes of phthalates for adults from foods in the Total Diet Study food groups for which quantitative data are available (see Table 1). On the basis of total phthalate measurements, these foods are expected to account for approximately 85% of dietary intake of phthalates. The contributions from other food groups is assumed to be zero. Food consumption data were taken from the Dietary and Nutritional Study of British Adults. Values for mean and high level intakes are derived from a distribution of the consumption patterns of survey respondents consuming any one or a combination of the foods for which quantitative data are available.

PHTHALATES IN INFANT FORMULAE
</KBD></H3>
<B>Summary</B><P>
MAFF's Food Safety Directorate has carried out a survey of phthalates in samples of 
retail infant formulae. Results indicate that dietary intakes of individual phthalates by 
infants consuming these formulae are below Tolerable Daily Intakes, where these have 
been set. The Department of Health has advised that these initial surveillance data and 
the available biological studies do not suggest that the concentrations of phthalates 
found in infant formulae would have any effect. This advice takes account of all 
available information on the possible effects of phthalates, including recent studies 
concerning oestrogenic activity. 
<P>
Phthalates were detected in all samples of infant formula that were analysed. As in 
earlier unpublished work conducted at CSL Food Science Laboratory, Norwich, the 
most abundant phthalate identified in all samples was di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(DEHP). Using the manufacturers’ feeding guides, average intakes of total phthalates 
(expressed as dimethyl phthalate) from infant formulae would be 0.13 mg/kg 
bodyweight/day for a new-born infant, falling to 0.10 mg/kg bodyweight/day at six 
months. Further work is required to establish the sources of phthalates present in infant 
formulae and the reasons for any systematic variation between different brands, and, as 
a matter of prudence, to reduce phthalate levels in infant formulae where possible. 
<P>
<B>Background</B><P>
Phthalic acid diesters, commonly known as phthalates, are a group of organic 
chemicals that have a variety of industrial uses, including use as plasticisers in a wide 
range of household and consumer goods,(1) uses in lubricating oils and uses as carriers 
for perfumes in cosmetics. The use of phthalates in plastic food packaging is limited, 
for example, to the manufacture of materials such as some adhesives and some printing 
inks. Phthalates are no longer used in the manufacture of cling film and most other 
food contact plastic materials. 
<P>
The release of phthalates to the environment may occur during the production and 
distribution of phthalates, during the manufacture or use of products in which they are 
used, or after the dispersal of these products. Although some phthalates occur 
naturally in coal, crude oil and shale, the contribution of such sources to general 
environmental levels of phthalates is likely to be insignificant.(2) As a result of their 
extensive use and their moderate resistance to degradation, phthalates are widely 
distributed in the environment and are often found at low levels in food. The toxicity of 
these substances has been considered by the EC Scientific Committee for Food (SCF), 
which has established Tolerable Daily Intakes (TDIs) for several of the chemicals in the 
group. 
<P>
A recent survey by MAFF showed that two phthalates, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and 
DEHP, were often present in paper and board packaging and were also present at 
generally low concentrations (typically less than 10 mg/kg) in foods packaged in paper 
and board.(3) The concentrations of phthalates in samples of fat analysed in this recent 
survey would be expected to be lower in the core than at the surface if migration from 
packaging was the major source of contamination. In over half the samples, the 
concentrations of the phthalates at the core were about equal to or higher than the 
concentrations found at the surface. These results suggested that phthalates in food 
originate at least in part from general environmental contamination. Results from other 
surveys of milk and milk products,(4),(5) pork fat (6) and fish(7),(8) also indicate that phthalates are present in food from general environrnental contamination rather than specific sources such as food packaging. 
<P>
The current survey was conducted to estimate the intakes of individual phthalates and 
total phthalates by infants from infant formulae. Information on the market share of 
different brands of infant formulae was taken from a MAFF study of food and 
nutritional intakes of infants conducted in 1986;(9) additional information on current 
brand availability was provided by the Infant and Dietetic Foods Association. 
<P>
A total of 59 individual samples of 15 different brands of infant formulae were 
purchased from retail outlets in five towns across the UK. In most, but not all, cases 
the different samples of each brand represented different manufacturing batches, as 
indicated by batch codes on the retail packaging. For each of the nine market-leading 
brands of casein-dominant, whey-dominant or soya-based products, samples were 
composited together such that each sample for analysis contained samples of a single 
brand. Three further composite samples were made up of (i) two other brands of 
casein-dominant formulae; (ii) two other brands of whey-dominant formulae; and (iii) 
two other brands of soya-based formulae. 
<P>
<B>Method</B><P> 
All samples were analysed at CSL Food Science Laboratory, Norwich. 
<P>
Identification and determination of individual phthalates
Infant formulae samples were extracted with acetone/hexane (1:1) and were 
fractionated by size exclusion chromatography then concentrated prior to analysis by 
gas chromatography/low resolution mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify individual 
phthalates. The limit of detection of the GC MS instrument was typically 0.001 mg/kg 
for individual phthalates. The analytical method has only recently been developed and 
insufficient validation data are available for a robust quantitative measure of 
repeatability to be given. Further analyses were conducted using gas 
chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry to confirm the identities of both 
major and minor peaks. These-showed that some small peaks with relative retention 
times coincident with those of phthalate standards were, in fact, interfering compounds 
that had been co-extracted. 
<P>
Concentrations of dipropyl phthalate (DPP), DBP, di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP), 
butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) and DEHP were quantified after appropriate calibration. 
The presence of five other phthalates (di-iso-propyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, 
dicyclohexyl phthalate, diheptyl phthalate and dinonyl phthalate) could be confirmed by 
gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry, but these compounds were 
not quantified. Phthalates of higher molecular weight (didecyl, diundecyl and didodecel 
isomers) were not detected in any of the samples analysed. 
<P>
Some commercially-important phthalate esters, such as di-iso-octyl phthalate (DIOP) 
are complex mixtures of isomers that are dispersed over a wide range of retention 
times in capillary column gas chromatography. Nine of the twelve samples were 
therefore analysed by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-MS) using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation interface, under which 
conditions the three mixtures of isomers represented by DIOP, di-iso-nonyl phthalate 
and di-iso-decyl phthalate are each eluted as single peaks, thus allowing total dioctyl, 
and dinonyl phthalate concentrations to be established. The limit of detection of the 
HPLC-MS instrument was of the order of 0.01 mg/kg for each of the mixtures of 
phthalate isomers. 
<P>
<B>Determination of total phthalates</B><P>
Infant formulae samples were extracted with acetonethexane (1:1) and phthalates were 
converted to dimethyl phthalate (DMP) by heating the extracts with methanolic 
potassium hydroxide solution and then with boron trifluoride/diethyl ether complex. 
These extracts were then fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and analysed 
by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
<P>
Preparation and analysis of the samples were completed in parallel, in a batch which 
included five process blank determinations. The lower limit at which DMP extracted 
from samples could be measured securely was set by the presence of DMP in blanks 
rather than by instrumental sensitivity. The limit of quantification of 0.10 mg/kg was 
the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the process blanks. 
<P>
Results for each of the twelve samples are the means of replicate determinations: 
<P>
* Eight determination were performed in duplicate; the overall mean difference 
between duplicate analyses was 16%. <BR>
* For two further samples, differences between duplicate analyses were excessive and 
a further pair of analyses was performed. In both cases the larger of the original results 
was clearly anomalous and was discarded. The result quoted is therefore the mean of 
the three other determinations <BR>
*  For two samples, analyses were performed in quadruplicate to provide an indication 
of repeatability. Relative standard deviations of the quadruplicate analyses were 6.3% 
and 9.6% 
<P>
<B>Results</B><P>
Total phthalates and individual phthalates were determined in all twelve composite 
samples. The concentrations of total phthalates, measured and expressed as DMP, and 
of individual phthalates in each of the samples are shown in Table 1. The 
concentrations of each of the analytes were similar in casein-dominant, whey-dominant 
and soya-based formulae. 
<P>
Dietary intakes of individual phthalates have been calculated for infants, based on the 
manufacturers' feeding guides and assuming that infant formulae were the only source 
of nutrition. When expressed on a bodyweight basis, consumption of infant formulae, 
and thence intakes of phthalates, are higher in new-born infants than in older children. 
For each compound, there will be a range of daily intakes between birth and six months 
due to changes in feeding regime and body weight over this period in the infant's life. 
These ranges are given in Table 2. 
<P>
The dietary intakes of total phthalates was estimated on the same basis as for individual 
phthalates. Average intakes of total phthalates from infant formulae would be 0.13 
(range: 0.03 to 0.23) mg/kg bodyweight/day in new-born infants, falling to 0.10 
(range: 0.02 to 0.19) mg/kg bodyweight/day at six months. A variable proportion (5% 
- 77%) of the measured total was attributable to the measured individual compounds. 
<P>
<B>Interpretation</B><P>
The toxicity of those phthalates permitted for use in food contact materials has been 
considered by the SCF. Sufficient toxicological data were available for the committee 
to set a TDI of 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight/day for DEHP and a temporary TDI for four 
of the other phthalates included in this survey: 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day for 
butylbenzyl phthalate; 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight for DBP; 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day for 
dicyclohexyl phthalate; and 0.2 mg/kg bodyweight/day for diethyl phthalate. Less 
toxicological data are available for the remaining phthalates used in food contact 
materials. The SCF has recommended a "group restriction” for the sum of these 
remaining compounds of 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight/day. Unlike the TDI, the group 
restriction is not a precise measure of potential risk to human health. Instead, it is a 
precautionary limit set to guide the food contact materials industry and enforcement 
authorities pending submission of further toxicological data.
<P>
 The TDIs for any of the individual phthalates would not be exceeded at any time by 
infants fed according to the manufacturers' instructions on any of the infant formulae 
analysed in this study. Dietary intakes of the sum of the other phthalates that were 
quantified in this study (DPP, DEBP and dioctyl phthalates other than DEHP) would 
also be lower than the recommended group restriction of 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight/day. 
<P>
The measurements of total phthalates found in infant formulae give average intake 
estimates falling from 0.13 to 0.10 mg/kg bodyweight/day over the first 6 months of 
life. Making a “worst case” assumption that all phthalates might have TDIs as low as 
DEHP or DBP, which is unlikely, total phthalate intakes exceed the lowest TDI of 
0.05 mg/kg bodyweight/day by two- to three-fold. However, the TDI incorporates a 
100-fold safety factor beyond the dose with no effect. The Department of Health has 
advised that there are unlikely to be any risks to infant health from total phthalate 
levels even using the above "worst case" assumptions about the activity of phthalates. 
The Department of Health has also commented that the lowest TDIs are based on the 
no-effect level for increases in liver peroxisomes, an effect seen in rodents exposed to 
certain phthalates, but man is either considerably less sensitive or may be insensitive to 
this effect. As this effect has been taken into account by the SCF when setting the 
TDIs and the group restriction for phthalates, it represents a very cautious approach to 
safety. 
<P>
The TDIs discussed above were established before the recent findings that some 
phthalates may have oestrogenic activity. Two phthalates, BBP and DBP, appear to 
have weak oestrogenic activity in vitro.(l0) That is, in "test tube" experiments they 
triggered some of the same effects as the natural hormone, oestradiol. However, they 
were about a million times less potent than oestradiol. The plasticisers, di-(2-
ethylhexyl) adipate and DEHP, were not found to be active. Activity in vitro is not 
necessarily evidence that they will be active in the human body. To date only one of 
these phthalates, BBP, has been tested in laboratory rodents.(11) Female rats were given BBP at a fixed concentration of 1 mg/l in their drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation. Resulting intakes were estimated to range from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg bodyweight/day during the treatment period. This was reported to cause small 
reductions in testis weight and sperm production in the male offspring, who would 
have been exposed to BBP via the mother during the entirety of their most vulnerable 
period of testis development. These studies suggest that BBP and DBP may have weak 
oestrogenic activity but at this stage the data are very tentative and no firm conclusions 
can be drawn. Studies to confirm these effects and to establish a no-effect level would 
be needed. 
<P>
Taking as a worst case the infant formula with the highest concentrations of the two 
phthalates which may have oestrogenic activity (BBP and DBP), the combined 
estimated intake of these two phthalates was 0.023 mg/kg bodyweight/day. This is 
between four- and seventeen-fold lower than the dose range said to cause minimal 
effects in rodents. All other formulae analysed had lower concentrations of these 
phthalates, ranging down to 33 to 133 times below the dose range said to cause 
minimal effects in rodents. 
<P>
The Department of Health has commented that there are differences in the timing of 
testis development between rats and humans that may be important for risk 
assessment. The relevant aspects of testis development in humans takes place over a 
much greater proportion of prenatal and postnatal life compared with testis 
development in the rat. Thus it is not possible to directly extrapolate from effects 
observed in rats to human new-borns and infants. The Department has advised that 
these initial surveillance data and the limited biological studies available so far do not 
suggest that the concentrations of phthalates found in infant formulae would have any 
effect in humans. Further work is required to establish the sources of phthalates 
present in infant formulae and the reasons for any systematic variation between brands 
and, as a matter of prudence, to reduce phthalate levels in infant formulae where 
possible.

Notes: Samples C1 to C5 are casein-dominant formulae; samples W1 to W5 are whey-dominant formulae; samples Sl and S2 are soya-based formulae <BR>
Concentrations of octyl phthalates other than DEHP were calculated by subtracting the concentrations of DEHP measured in each sample from the 
concentrations of total dioctyl phthalates. The result was used to calculate intakes of octyl phthalates other than DEHP for each of the infant formulae. 
<P>
- = concentration of total dioctyl phthalates not measured. 
<P>
a) total pithalate was measured independently (see methods section) and the intake of total phthalates is not the sum of intakes of 
individual phthalates given in the table.

<P>"Data from men in greater Seattle area reveals no downward 
trend in semen quality: further evidence that deterioration 
of semen quality is not geographically uniform."
<P>C. Alvin Paulsen, M.D.

<P>Nancy G. Berman, Ph.D.

<P>Christina Wang, M.D.

<P>University of Washington , Seattle, Washington, and Harbor-University of California 
Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center, Torrance, California

<P>Objective: To determine whether there has been a decline in semen quality in a group 
of healthy men during the past 21 years. 

<P>Design: Retrospective analysis of the relationship between time and changes in semen 
parameters over 21 years using regression analysis.

<P>Setting: A tertiary university center.

<P>Patients: Five hundred ten healthy, normal men who donated multiple semen samples 
as participants in clinical studies between 1972 and 1993.

<P>Main Outcome Measures: Sperm concentration, semen volume, total number of 
sperm per ejaculate, and percent spermatozoa with normal morphology.

<P>Results: There was no decrease in sperm concentration, semen volume, total number 
of sperm per ejaculate, and percent normal sperm morphology on 510 healthy men 
studied between 1972 and 1993.

<P>Conclusion: We conclude that in this population of healthy young men there has not 
been any decline in semen quality in the past 21 years.

<P><B>Geographic variations in sperm counts: a potential cause of bias in studies of semen quality
</B>
<P>Harry Fisch, M.D.
Erik T. Goluboff, M.D.


<P>Columbia-Presbyterian Medical center,  and Albert Einstein College of Medicine,  New York, New York

<P>Objective: To determine whether geographic variations in sperm counts might bias conclusions drawn from studies of  semen quality.

<P>Design:  Reanalysis of published data from a meta-analysis of 61 studies from 1938 to 1990 that concluded a worldwide decline in semen quality over the last 50 years.

<P>Main Outcome Measures: Influence of geographic location on sperm counts.

<P>Results: Of 61 studies in the meta-analysis, only 20 included ³ 100 men. These 20 studies collectively comprised 91% of the total men studied. We focused our reanalysis on these 20 studies. Of the studies before 1970, all were from the United States and 80% were from New 
York. These studies represented locations with the highest sperm counts. In contrast, after 1970, 80% of the studies were from locations not 
represented earlier, including five studies from third world countries, where sperm counts were low.

<P>Conclusions: Sperm counts vary dramatically among different geographic locations. Geographic variations in sperm counts need to be considered when analyzing data from different locations.

<P><H2>Panic over falling sperm counts may be premature</H2>

<P><B>Norman Bauman</B>, New York

<P>AMERICAN men are not suffering from declining sperm counts. In fact their sperm seem to be doing rather well, researchers announced at a meeting of the American Urological Association in Florida last week. What's more, sperm counts are closely correlated with birth rates, says Harry Fisch, director of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York. 

<P>Fisch's findings contradict those of European researchers, who have been amassing evidence for a worldwide decline in sperm counts. In 1992, Niels Skakkebaek of the University of Copenhagen sounded the first alarm. After analysing data from studies going back to the 1930s, he concluded that there had been a dramatic decline in sperm counts. Last year, a French study confirmed that counts were falling in Paris. 

<P>Skakkebaek and others argue that the decline - together with other male reproductive problems such as an increase in testicular cancer and malformations of the penis - might be linked to rising levels of oestrogen-like compounds in the environment. People are exposed to oestrogen mimics in foods such as milk and soya beans, and through polluting chemicals such as PCBs, dioxins and detergents. Other researchers found male fish in polluted waters behaving physiologically like females, and there has been a shift in the sex ratios of alligators in polluted waters in Florida. 

<P>Fisch, however, believes there has been no decline in sperm counts. He says that the European studies were flawed because they failed to take into account geographical variations and fluctuations from year to year, or suffered from sampling bias . 

<P>Fisch reviewed sperm counts of 1283 men who banked sperm between 1970 and 1994 before they had a vasectomy, in Los Angeles, Roseville in Minnesota, and New York City. He found a statistically significant increase in New York and Minnesota and a slight but not statistically significant increase in California. The average sperm count rose from 77 million per millilitre in 1970 to 89 million/ml in 1994, he reports in the latest issue of Fertility and Sterility. In the same issue, Alvin Paulsen of the University of Washington in Seattle, reports that he found no fall-off in sperm counts among 510 students who donated sperm for research between 1972 and 1993. 

<P>Most surprising, says Fisch, was the great variation in counts both geographically and from year to year. He believes this explains why earlier studies wrongly concluded that there has been a severe decline. Within the US, counts varied hugely according to where men live. Californian men had the lowest counts (73 million/ml). In Minnesota they were higher (101 million/ml), but New Yorkers held the record (131 million/ml). 

<P>But Fisch also points out that variation from one year to the next could be greater than the variation over 25 years. For example, the variation from 1976 to 1977 is almost as large as the entire variation for all years. "So if you selected two years out of this data, you could get completely different conclusions about the long-term trend," he says. "If we looked at our data from 1984 to 1994, we would also have concluded a decline." Fisch also found a strong correlation between the average sperm count in a particular year and the birth rate in Minnesota, suggesting that sperm counts may be an index of fertility. 

<P>These findings clearly contradict those of the Danish and French studies, Fisch says. The study that first put men on alert was Skakkebaek's huge multi-study analysis, in which he looked at the data from 61 sperm count studies in the medical literature since 1930, covering 14 947 men. He found that between 1940 and 1990, sperm counts fell by 60 per cent on average, and he concluded that there was "a genuine decline in semen quality". 

<P>Fisch points out that 93 per cent of the men in Skakkebaek's pre1970 data were from New York, where he found sperm counts were highest, whereas after 1970, most of the data came from developing countries, where sperm counts were lower. He observed differences in geography, not time, says Fisch. 

<P>Skakkebaek admits that a meta-analysis of the world's literature is very crude. "Fisch's data are very important," he says. Recent studies in Edinburgh and Belgium show declines, while studies in Toulouse, France, and from  Finland do not, he says. 

<P>But that does not mean that all is well, Skakkebaek says. "I confidently believe there is a problem with male reproductive health." The incidence of testicular cancer is increasing every year, and in Denmark now affects 1 per cent of young men. 

<P>He points out that Fisch's geographical variation in itself would indicate that there could be environmental impact. It's difficult to explain the difference between East coast and West coast on ethnic grounds, he says. 

<P>The French study, similar to Fisch's, is by Pierre Jouannet of the Centre for the Study of Human Eggs and Sperm in Paris. He studied 1351 sperm donors in Paris. Men who donated sperm for artificial insemination in 1973, at an average age of 32, had a mean sperm count of 89 million/ml, while men who donated sperm in 1992 at an average age of 36 had a count of 60 million/ml, a drop of 33 per cent. Jouannet stresses that his conclusions cannot be extended to any other place or even to the whole of Paris. 

<P>"One of the most puzzling points is the tremendous variability of reported sperm characteristics from one place to another," says Jouannet. We cannot rule out the effects of chemicals in the environment.  "The debate is still open."

<P><H3><KBD>Declining sperm counts</KBD></H3>

<P><H4><KBD>Environmental chemicals may be to blame</KBD></H4>


<P>The controversy over whether sperm counts have declined over the past 50 years is reopened by two papers in this issue of the BMJ.  In a carefully analysed study of cohorts of unselected men in Britain born between 1951 and 1973, Irvine and colleagues demonstrate a progressive decline in sperm concentration and total sperm number per ejaculate of about 2% a year over 11 years.1   A smaller study by Bujan et al finds no change in sperm counts of sperm donors in the Toulouse area of France over a 16 year period.2

<P>The controversy over sperm counts began with a meta-analysis by Carlsen et al which showed a decline in a sperm concentrations from 113x 106/ml to 66x 106/ml between 1940 and 1990.3  These findings were supported by Auger et al in a study of 1351 fertile men in Paris.4  Commentators have criticised both the retrospective design and the mathematical analysis used by Carlsen et al.5 6   "Irvine et al have used data from one laboratory and employed appropriate mathematical analysis to reach their conclusion that sperm counts have declined.1  Bujan et al suggest that the difference between their findings and those of Auger et al4 may be related to the differing environmental conditions of rural and urban populations.2 


<P>The reported decrease in sperm concentration may seem difficult to reconcile with the absence of any detectable decrease in male fertility.5   But important impairment of fertility is often not evident until sperm concentrations decline below 5x 106/ml.7   This is consistent with one hypothesis advanced to explain the decline in sperm count.  Sharpe and Skakkebaek proposed that exposure of the fetal testis to oestrogens or oestrogenic compounds decreased the multiplication of Sertoli cells.8  These cells control the inner environment of the seminiferous tubules in which spermatogenesis occurs,9 and there is strong evidence that each Sertoli cell can support only a limited number of germ cells.10  Hence a decrease in the number of Sertoli cells reduces the output of fertile spermatozoa.  Our growing knowledge of how the number of Sertoli cells can be manipulated11 may provide clues to how environmental factors affect sperm output. 


<P><H4><KBD>Oestrogens and pesticides are implicated</KBD></H4>

<P>The concept that exposure of the fetal testis to oestrogens can interfere with adult sperm production is supported by other data.  The sons of women who were given diethylstilboestrol in pregnancy between 1945 and 1970 have been found to have decreased sperm counts and semen volume and an increased incidence of cryptorchidism and hypospadias.12  The Danish Environmental Protection Agency has recently released a report raising concern over possible links between environmental chemicals that have oestrogenic effects and the increasing incidence of cryptorchidism, testicular cancer, and declining sperm counts.13 

<P>Another environmental pollutant with the potential to influence testicular function in utero is the main metabolite of DDT, p,p-DDE, which has been shown to act as an antiandrogen.14  Countries such as Brazil and Mexico used nearly 1000 tonnes of DDT in 1992.15  The metabolic products of DDT and related molecules seem to have the capacity to act through oestrogenic or antiandrogenic mechanisms on the developing male reproductive tract.15 

<P>The time delay between exposure to an agent and development of reproductive dysfunction can often pose problems of linkage.  Until recently, for example, the cause of Young's syndrome remained obscure.  Young's syndrome occurs in men with bronchiectasis and is characterised by azoospermia due to epididymal obstruction.16  No link has been found with mutations of the cystic fibrosis gene.18  The syndrome was particularly prevalent in Britain and Australia between l960 and 198016 but is now rarely seen.17  In l993 Hendry et al noted that many men with Young's syndrome had a history of Pink's disease in infancy.18  Pink's disease disappeared around 1960 with the removal of mercury from teething powders, and the disappearance of Young's syndrome some 30 years later raises the strong possibility that exposure to mercury in infancy may have caused both Pink's disease and Young's syndrome through mechanisms yet to be elucidated. 

<P>Such examples, and our growing understanding of the vulnerability of the male reproductive system to environmental factors, highlight the need for vigilance.  Regulatory and research agencies need to determine the most appropriate methods of assessing the actions of agents on the reproductive system, and should undertake whatever studies are necessary to confirm or refute the emerging hypotheses.  Delay may compromise the fertility of future generations.

<P><KBD><a href="#endsadd"><font color="#ff0000">ENDS</font></a> Report 251, December 1995.</KBD>

<P><H2><KBD>Study shows phthalates, APEs reduce sperm counts. </KBD></H2>

<P>Low levels of exposure to oestrogenic chemicals can cause laboratory rats to have lower sperm counts and smaller testes, a scientific study has confirmed (1).  The research gives the first strong experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that exposure to industrial chemicals - particularly phthalates, alkyl phenols and bisphenol A - is responsible for observed declines in human sperm production.  Although the effects seen are not proven to be oestrogenic, they appear to occur at exposures which are below recognised no observed effect levels (NOELs). 

<P>Recent epidemiological studies have reported that men's sperm counts are in decline, while certain male reproductive disorders, including testicular cancer, are on the increase.  Wildlife scientists have drawn parallels with the reproductive problems seen in animal populations affected by pollution and suggest that the effects in man may be the result of exposure to chemicals with hormonal properties.  A recent review of the evidence commissioned by the Department of the Environment from the Institute for Environment and Health concluded that the link was "plausible" (ENDS Report 246, pp 3-5). 

<P>The present study was carried out by Dr Richard Sharpe and colleagues at the Medical Research Council's Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh.  Dr Sharpe fed female rats with chemicals which had been shown to be oestrogenic in vitro assays - butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and octyl phenol (OP).  BBP is a plasticiser used in PVC packaging, and OP is a breakdown product of alkyl phenol ethoxylate (APE) detergents.  Both are widespread in the environment.  Another group of rats was fed the APE detergent octyl phenol polyethoxylate (OPP), which shows little or no activity in in vitro oestrogen assays. 

<P>The dose levels were chosen to mimic possible levels of human exposure, and a positive control group of animals was also fed a powerful synthetic oestrogen, diethylstilboestrol (DES), for comparison. 

<P>The rats were mated and their male offspring allowed to grow to maturity, receiving doses of the test compound during postnatal development.  The testis weight, sperm count, and body and organ weights of the offspring were measured at maturity and the results compared with control animals which received no oestrogenic compounds. 

<P>The results showed that male rats exposed to all three test compounds had significantly smaller testes than the controls by a factor of 5-13%.  Sperm counts were also reduced in animals treated with OP and BBP by 10-21%.  DES reduced size and sperm count in exposed animals, but also had other effects on body weight and litter size. 

<P>The researchers found that the testis structure of the treated animals was identical to the controls, but believe that the crucial effect of the chemicals may have been to reduce the number of sperm-producing Sertoli cells.  These are formed only during a fixed window of development, and their number affects the total size and sperm production of the organ. 

<P>The experimental design included three different treatment regimes to test the effects of different lengths of exposure.  All offspring were exposed to oestrogenic chemicals up until weaning, but in one group treatment began after birth, in the second group mothers began treatment two weeks prior to conception, and in the third group the mothers had been exposed for seven weeks before conception. 

<P>The treatment effects were consistent across all three groups, but the animals which received the longest exposure generally showed the most pronounced effects.  The suggestion is that all of the compounds accumulate in mother and offspring and exert a cumulative effect. 

<P>The potency of OPP in the experiment compared to its very weak effects in vitro was also particularly striking.  The researchers attribute this to its metabolism to OP in the animals a reaction which does not occur readily in cell cultures. 

<P>The experimental animals received up to 370æg/kg/day of OP, OPP and BBP, but as the chemicals were administered via drinking water, exposure increased as the animals grew.  The researchers conclude that, at least as far as BBP is concerned, human exposure may approach, but is likely to be less than, the experimental levels.  They note that there appear to be no data on human exposure to OP and APEs. 

<P>Monitoring by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF) has shown that many packaged foods contain levels of phthalates in the tens of milligrams per kilogram range (ENDS Report 245, pp 7-8).  The researchers note that one study has shown that foil-packed butter contained close to 50mg/kg of BBP. Consumption of 50g per day of this product alone would give a 60kg person an intake of 40 microgrammes/kg body weight/day, leading them to recommend that "further studies on the oestrogenicity of phthalates should be a priority."

<P>The study does not prove that the effects of the compounds are caused by oestrogenic or other hormonal mechanisms.  However, given the current understanding of the possible developmental effects of hormone-disrupting compounds, such mechanisms do appear highly probable. 

<P>Dr Sharpe was not available for comment as the paper appeared in print.  But co-author Professor John Sumpter of Brunel University said: "I was surprised at the relatively low level at which the effects were seen."  He added: "I am pretty certain that human exposure to BBP is less than in the experiment, but that is a single chemical and what is more realistic is simultaneous exposure to several compounds at lower levels."  Experiments along these lines should be a priority for future research, he recommended. 

<P>Professor Sumpter also confirmed that Dr Sharpe has completed studies on bisphenol-A - a compound known to have oestrogenic properties which has been found to leach into food from the epoxy lining of some metal cans (ENDS Report 246, p3).  Bisphenol-A was also found to cause a reduction in rat testis size and sperm production. 

<P>Dr Sharpe's results suggest that several oestrogenic chemicals may have significant effects at levels much lower than those previously regarded as toxicologically significant.  For example, the researchers note that the established NOEL of BBP for testicular toxicity in rats is 125-150mg/kg body weight/day, a factor of 300 higher than the doses shown to be effective in the experiment. 

<P>Gwynne Lyons, scientific consultant to the Worldwide Fund for Nature, commented: "The results call into question previous NOELs for environmental chemicals.  These effects are subtle and not easily seen.  Industry needs to look more closely at its toxicity testing protocols." 

<P>Geoff Randall, who chairs a European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology Of Chemicals (ECETOC) task force on environmental oestrogens, said that the paper was "an interesting piece of work but not sufficiently thorough to test the hypothesis [that industrial chemicals affect human sperm counts] fully."  He added: "The trouble is we don't know the dose.  The materials are in the drinking water and we can't plot a dose/response curve."  More robust studies are needed to quantify the effects and explain their relationship to effects in humans, he concluded.

<H3><KBD>Some of our sperm are missing</KBD></H3>


THE quality of men's sperm declined steadily in the early years of the 21st century until hardly anyone could reproduce in the normal way. Meanwhile, the countryside was virtually emptied of animals as natural populations crashed. The first signs of the impending catastrophe were noted in the 1990s, but few people then believed that a cocktail of pollutants that mimic human hormones could have such profound effects. And so nothing was done-until it was too late. 
<P>
This chilling scenario has already inspired a best-selling thriller by R D. James, The Children of Men. But could any of it be true? Are pollutants altering the reproductive health of humans and wildlife? "Everybody in the environmental movement is drawing their breath and saying my God, what if,” says Gwynne Lyons pollutant  consultant to the World  Wide Fund for Nature. Her organisation, along with Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, has recently campaigned against hormone-like pollutants - or "endocrine disrupters"- in the environment. And she believes we need urgent action to reduce the exposure of  humans and wildlife to these chemicals in water, food and air. 
<P>

<B>Flawed Statistics </B>
<P>
Yet last month, a report for the British government, by the Institute for Environment and Health at Leicester, found no direct evidence of a causal link between these environmental chemicals and reproductive problems in people. The report concluded that "it is currently very difficult to assess" whether environmental oestrogens might be responsible for a fall in sperm counts or rising rates of testicular cancer. Lewis Smith, director of the institute, added that a ban on suspected chemicals would be premature. Others are downright sceptical. "I am absolutely not worried," says Jack Cohen, a developmental biologist at the University of Warwick, who believes that the alleged fall in sperm counts is based on flawed statistics. 
<P>
<B>So who is right?</B>
<P>
Most researchers would agree that an overdose of oestrogenic chemicals could damage a fetus: sex hormones such as oestrogen influence the development of the reproductive system in the developing fetus, including the Sertoli cells that control future sperm production. And since sex hormones can also stimulate the proliferation of cancer cells, in theory environmental chemicals that mimic them could be responsible for the rise in testicular cancer. In theory, too, such chemicals could damage the reproductive health of women. Indeed, medical researchers have already seen what can happen later in life to fetuses exposed to an excess of hormones during pregnancy thanks to a famous "medical mistake". Between the 1940s and the late 1970s doctors prescribed a synthetic oestrogen drug, DES-or~diethylstilboestrol, to an estimated 2.3 million pregnant women worldwide in the belief that it would prevent miscarriage. The adult children of the women given DES are now acknowledged to be at greater risk of developing various cancers of the reproductive system. They also suffer a higher incidence of infertility and other reproductive problems. 
<P>
But the fact that certain substances could damage reproductive health doesn't necessarily mean that the chemicals people are currently exposed to in their everyday lives are actually doing so. Establishing such a link scientifically is no easy task, and most of the evidence accumulated so far is dogged by uncertainty. 
<P>
The strongest evidence that something is amiss comes from surveys of men's reproductive health, and in particular from semen samples analysed  at sperm banks or fertility centres. According to studies in Denmark, Scotland and France over the past three years, the number of sperm generated by the average "normal" man in an ejaculation has fallen substantially - by almost half - compared with samples taken 50 years ago. Over the same timescale, the rate of testicular cancer in adult men has doubled, and there has also apparently been a rise in the number of boys born with misshapen penises or testicles. 
<P>

Two years ago, an Anglo-Danish research team attempted to link all these observations. Richard Sharpe, of the MRC's Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh, and Niels Skakkebaek of the University of Copenhagen, argued that oestrogen-mimicking chemicals in the environment might be damaging male fetuses in the womb. "It is only a hypothesis," Sharpe emphasises, "but all the facts fit." 
<P>
The problem is that the central "fact" of the case - that sperm quantity and quality has declined - is strongly disputed. A comprehensive American study published in 1979 found no evidence for any decline from 1951 to 1977, and more recent studies have
also been attacked by researchers in Britain and the US. Last year, for example, Cohen, with Ian Stewart, a mathematician at Warwick, published  a paper in the British Medical Journal  which claimed to find statistical flaws in the Danish study that first reported the decline. The study is flawed, says  Cohen, because the WHO "changed the goalposts", raising the lower limits of a "normal" sperm count, in the mid-1960s. "The change in reference value accounts for almost all the decline, and what's left is probably just  statistical noise," comments Stewart.
<P>
Earlier this year, a group of American epidemiologists from the Dow Chemical Company,  Shell and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston  reanalysed the data from the Danish study using three different statistical models, in a report published in Fertility and Sterility. The researchers point out that the linear regression model used in the Danish study, if extrapolated forward in time, "portends the collapse of traditional means of procreation by the middle of the next century". Yet alternative models which fit the data just as well suggest that average sperm counts have been increasing since the late 1970s, while a third approach, the "stairstep" model, indicates that a large drop in sperm counts happened in the mid1960s with counts constant ever since. 
<P>
The most recent study, of Parisian sperm donors, has stood up better to statistical scrutiny. Nevertheless, reviewing all the published studies, the Institute for Environment and Health report concludes that the evidence for falling sperm counts is "not entirely convincing". 
<P>
If proving that sperm counts are falling is difficult, establishing a direct link with specific environmental chemicals - and ruling out the effects of changes in people's lifestyles and diets - is harder still. Certainly, the list of chemicals alleged to mimic or interfere with sex hormones is now vast. It includes ubiquitous industrial chemicals and products of petrol combustion such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins; phthalates which are added as plasticisers in plastics and used as ingredients in paints, inks and adhesives, alkyl phenolic substances (such as octyl and nonyl phenol), which are breakdown products of alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEs) used as surfactants in industrial detergents and also found in paints, herbicides and some plastics; and organochlorine pestirides such as DDT. aldrin and dieldrin. 
<P>

<B>Plastic tubing</B>
<P>
However, only a tiny number of these chemicals have actually been shown in lab tests to behave like a sex hormone. The research just hasn't been done, partly because there are no quick and easy ways to screen chemicals for oestrogenic effects. Nor is the degree of our exposure clear. What is known is more by accident than design. 
<P>
For instance, in 1991 Ana Soto at Tufts Unjversity in Boston stumbled on the truth about one chemical, a common additive in plastics, when it leached from plastic tubing into the cells growing in the laboratory. She noticed that something was encouraging the growth of the human breast cancer cell line. The culprit, nonylphenol, turns out to act like an oestrogen hormone, and stimulates breast cells to divide. "Industry uses about 300 000 tonnes of APEs every year, 60 per cent of which ends up in water," says Charles Tyler, a researcher studying oestrogens in the environment with fish endocrinologist John Sumpter at Brunel University. A new paper by Sharpe and Sumpter, to be published in Environmental Health Perspectives, reports an experiment in which pregnant lab rats were fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to what a human might be exposed to. At maturity, the male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. 

<P>
Sumpter began his investigations when anglers began turning up odd-looking fish with ambiguous genitalia in the mid1980s. With government funding, he placed caged male fish (typically rainbow trout) near sewage outflows into rivers to act as sensitive "biomonitors" of hormonal pollution. If the male fish detects oestrogen, says Sumpter, it produces an egg yolk protein, vitellogenin, usually produced in quantity only by females. The more vitellogenin in his blood, the more oestrogen in the river, Sumpter surmised. He found the male fish placed in some 30 different sites in British rivers made vitellogenin in very large amounts - "physiologically, they were behaving like females," he says. 
<P>
The pesticide DDT has also been identified as an endocrine disrupter in wildlife, not least because of an outbreak of male alligators with abnormally small penises in Lake Apopka in Florida - which had been accidentally polluted by a massive pesticide spal in 1980. Most of the male reptiles were sterile - the result, it was thought, of "feminising" exposure to oestrogen-like DDT. But there was a new twist to the story in June this year when William Kelce of the US Environmental Protection Agency and his colleagues reported in Nature that DDE, DDT's main breakdown product, is an "antiandrogen": rather than acting like an oestrogen, it blocks the action of "male" androgen hormones instead. 
<P>
Like a wrong key that fits into a lock but won't quite open it, all these endocrine-disrupting compounds can bind to hormone receptors on the surfaces of human cells. So DDE binds to the androgen receptor, for example, while nonylphenol binds to the oestrogen receptor. Once securely plugged into a receptor, these artificial horrnones then behave abnormally. They set off only some of the biochemical reactions normally stimulated by bona fide oestrogen or androgen. What's more, their very presence on the receptors blocks the normal lines of communication between the natural hormone and a cell. 
<P>
Popular headlines call these substances "the emasculators" or talk about "the chemical attack on the male sex". But female wildlife and women may also be at risk. For instance, an epidemic of infertile eggs laid by western gulls and common and roseate terns on the Pacific coast of the US has recently been attributed to oestrogenic effects of DDT and PCBs. 
<P>
Some believe that oestrogen-like compounds in the environment may be contributing to the steady rise in the rate of breast cancer. 
<P>
But epidemiologists in Britain are by and large sceptical of such claims. "There has been no sudden upturn in deaths from breast cancer since pesticides were introduced," says Valerie Beral director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's Cancer Epidemiology Unit in Oxford. The increasing trend for women to have fewer children later in life is probably largely to blame, she suspects. Similarly, the steady rise in testicular cancer rates could also be linked to marked changes in lifestyle since the Second World War. 
<P>
Attempts to blame human health problems on oestrogenic chemicals must also contend with the fact that fetuses are inevitably exposed to their mothers' bloodstream, which is awash with oestrogen during pregnancy. But Sharpe and his like-minded colleagues argue that while fetuses may be somehow protected against natural oestrogen, they are not safe from synthetic variants. 
<P>
One sign that natural oestrogenic chemicals found in plants are benign is the longevity and good health of the Japanese. The Japanese diet is extraordinarily rich in oestrogen-mimics produced by plants such as soya beans. Yet there is no sign of increased infertility in Japan, and the nation's cancer rates are among the lowest in the world. Indeed, nutritionists at the MRC Dunn Nutrition Unit in Cambridge and elsewhere suspect a diet high in plant oestrogens may actively lower a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. 
<P>


<B>Polluted fat</B>
<P>
Plant oestrogens may be something we've evolved to cope with, suggests Lyons at WWE "What is new is manmade chemicals mimicking hormones." Certainly, the ability of synthetic chemicals such as DDT, phthalates and APEs to accumulate in fats in the body sets them apart from natural plant oestrogens and may make them more dangerous. These chemicals can be taken up by algae and fish so that trace amounts in rivers, lakes and the sea become multiplied thousands of times in food. The chemicals can then be stored in human fat; if this fat is broken down, as often happens early in pregnancy, concentrated pollutants may flood the system. 
<P>
The chemicals may also have additive effects, as researchers at Brunel have discovered. When fish were exposed to a mixture of oestrogenic compounds, the vitellogenin response was larger than if either chemical had been added alone, says Tyler. The message here is that even if chemical oestrogens are much less powerful than natural steroids - and some PCB-type compounds are known to be a million times less potent - the combined effects of a multitude of different chemicals could still be noticeable. "We are particularly concerned that with the tens or hundreds of different substances acting on the same receptors," says Lyons, "even small amounts of pollutants in the environment could have quite startling effects." 

<P>
A report produced for the Danish government and published earlier this year called for urgent research, particularly into the exposure of women of childbearing age to oestrogenic pollutants. It also warned that existing methods of testing for toxicity may not pick up the harmful effects of oestrogenic pollutants. In the US, environmental campaigners have called for new chemicals to be screened for their ability to mimic hormones before they are released into the environment. Sumpter and his colleagues at Brunel are working to develop a genetically engineered strain of yeast that contains the human oestrogen receptor. This could streamline the screening of thousands of chemicals and become a standard test for oestrogenic effects. 
<P>
The Institute for Environment and Health report, accepted by the government, argues that more research is needed before any chemicals are banned. "It's a major nightmare trying to unravel what is going on, to find out how much oestrogen is present and what its consequences are - 50 years of research is needed," says Sumpter. But Lyons and fellow campaigners say we can't wait for scientific proof of cause and effect. "With widespread and multiple exposures to chemicals, it will be more or less impossible to get that proof," she argues. "We must act now on the weight of evidence to reduce the release of  these substances."

<P><H3><KBD>DoE report understates evidence of oestrogen pollution </KBD></H3>


<P>There is convincing evidence of a decline in human reproductive health but no evidence of a causal link with oestrogenic chemicals, a review commissioned by the Department of the Environment (DoE) has concluded.1 

<P>However, some of the chemicals which are of most concern - notably phthalates and bisphenol-A - barely get a mention. The review is also in danger of understating the full force of the scientific argument behind current concerns because of its focus on gaps in the evidence. 

<P>The report was commissioned from the Institute of Environment and Health (IEH) in response to growing concern about the possible impacts of oestrogen-mimicking chemicals on the reproductive health of human and wildlife populations. It reviews much ofthe scientific evidence to emerge in recent years (ENDS Reports 226, pp 21-24, and 243, pp 15-19). 

<P>On human health effects, the IEH found the evidence of increases in breast and testicular cancers "particularly convincing". The incidence of hypospadias - a deformation of the penis - has also increased substantially, it says. But on the question of sperm counts, it concludes only that "the balance of evidence suggests a downward trend", while trends in undescended testes and male breast cancer are even less certain. 

<P>The report barely considers possible biological mechanisms connecting these health trends with environmental oestrogens, and finds other hypotheses explaining them to be "plausible". 

<P>Findings in wildlife - such as vitellogenic responses in fish exposed to oestrogenic effluents (see pp 5-6) and reproductive failure in alligators exposed to organo-chlorine pesticides - "increase the concern", it says. 

<P>But the report's bottom line is that "a causal relationship between exposure to environmental oestrogens and adverse effects on human reproductive health has not yet been established. Further information from epidemiological and experimental studies is still needed to allow assessments of risk to be made based on a weight of evidence approach." 

<P>The report was welcomed by Environment Secretary John Gummer as "a sound basis for taking forward our policies." It "reinforces the need for further research to clarify whether real problems exist," he said. 

<P>The report suggests many topics for future research. One key area is evolving standardised tests for oestrogenic effects. A widely used human breast cancer cell assay has been criticised by industry specialists because its oestrogen receptor is believed to be abnormal. 

<P>Assessments of human exposures to key chemicals of concern are also needed. These include phthalate plasticisers, alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs) and the epoxy resin monomer bisphenol-A (see p 3). A dietary study of phthalates in food is due to be completed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF) early next year but other sources of exposure also need to be examined. MAFF studies have already suggested that environmental and food processing sources may be significant (ENDS Report 245, pp 7-8). 

<P>The UK is also cornmitted to conducting risk assessments on alkylphenols as part of an EC programme of testing bulk industrial chemicals. Other research priorities are more long term, such as establishing a baseline of sperm counts to assess whether these are declining. 

<P>However, research most likely to push the issue forward has already been completed by Dr Richard Sharpe and colleagues at the Medical Research Council's Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh. In a television interview in July, he said that he had results awaiting publication which show that low-level exposure of pregnant rats to phthalates caused a reduction in testis weight in their male offspring. The changes were induced by levels comparable to human dietary exposures. Other oestrogenic compounds, including bisphenol-A and alkylphcnols, proved to have similar effects. 

<P>Speaking at the report's launch, IEH Director Professor Lewis Smith acknowledged the importance of Dr Sharpe's findings. "If these effects are convincingly demonstrated in rats then my personal view is that there should be action," he said. "It would be a case of using the precautionary principle." 

<P>The view of the DoE, IEH and Dr Sharpe remains, however, that there is at present insufficient evidence on any compound for regulatory action. But Friends of the Earth and the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) have criticised the Government for failing to act now on a precautionary basis. 

<P>For the Chemical Industries Association (CIA), Liz Surkovic suggested that the reproductive effects may have been caused by "lifestyle changes". Consumption of fat, fibre and phytoestrogens had all changed in the last fifty years, she said. But she declined to repeat to ENDS earlier CIA allegations that tight underpants were responsible. 

<P>In press statements, the CIA, the British Plastics Federation (BPF) and the Soap and Detergent Industries Association all highlighted the relatively “weak” oestrogenic activity of chemicals like APEs and phthalates. This is one poinl not covered fully by the IEH review. Although these artificial oestrogens are 1,000 times less active than natural oestrogen in cell assays, the comparison ls a false one. 

<P>As the report notes, natural oestrogens are bound to proteins in the blood stream called sex hormone binding globulins (SHBG). These lower the effectivc concentration of oestrogen in the body and mediate its effects. However, there is good reason to believe that the mechanism does not work for artificial oestrogens 

<P>In general, binding to the oestrogen receptor is non-specific. Binding to SHBG proteins is much more specific and some artificial oestrogens, such as the drug diethyl stilboestrol, are known not to bind to SHBG. The absence of this control mechanism will amplify the effects of these compounds. 

<P>Research on the effect of APEs on fish has also found that in vitro assays underestimate the oestrogenic effects of the detergents on living animals by l00 times (see pp 5-6). The effects are probably due to the length of the exposure and to bioaccumulation. 

<P>The IEH is also open to criticism for giving only a passing mention to phthalates and bisphenol-A. A BPF spokesman told ENDS that phthalates were therefore "not a chemical of concern". However, the DoE told ENDS that their omission had been purely a matter of  timing because key papers implicating them have only been published in recent weeks. "Phthalate esters are at the top of our list," the DoE says. 

<P>As reported last month, studies by MAFF have shown that phthalate plasticisers are present in some foods in the tens of milligrams per kilogram range. Migration from packaging is one of the major sources. However, the different branches of the packaging industry are all denying responsibility for the contamination. 

<P>The BPF and the European Council of Plastics and Intermediates (ECPI) told ENDS that phthalate levels in plastic packaging are negligible. The ECPI said that "printing inks, adhesives and coatings are the major applications." 

<P>Moira Macmillan of the British Coatings Federation (BCF) admitted that phthalates were present in inks but declined to give levels. She also said that "printing inks cannot be the only source", but when pressed was unable to give any figures to justify the claim. 

<P>The BCF represents ink and coating manufacturers but has not taken a stand on the phthalates issue. It says that its members are taking different views. Some are talking to their customers about substitution, while others believe the issue will affect specialist applications and are delaying action until it is forced on them. 

<P>Industry associations such as the BCF and ECPI are failing to acknowledge the severity of the situation by taking refuge in dubious statements from MAFF. A recent study of foods packaged in paper and board concluded, MAFF has said, that estimated phthalate intakes from these sources would be "well within tolerable levels", and that even the intakes of extreme consumers "would be well within the respective tolerable daily intakes (TDIs)." 

<P>The statements do not stand up to scrutiny. MAFF has not yet considered total dietary intakes of phthalates, and rough calculations from previous MAFF studies on a wide range of foods suggest that TDIs - which were in any event not intended to protect against oestrogenic effects - could easily be exceeded. 


<P>WWF's pollution consultant Gwynne Lyons commented: "The Department of Health's Committee on Toxicology said that phthalates were insufficiently tested in 1987, and repeated the warning in 1990. Industry is culpable and wanton for not testing them."

<B>Abstract. </B><P>
Sewage, a complex mixture of organic and inorganic chemicals, is considered to be a major source of environmental pollution. A random screen of 20 organic man-made chemicals present in liquid effluents revealed that half appeared able to interact with the estradiol receptor. This was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit binding of 17b-estradiol to the fish estrogen receptor. Further studies using mammalian estrogen screens in vitro, revealed that the two phthalate esters butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DBP) and a food antioxidant, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were estrogenic; however they were all less estrogenic than the environmental estrogen octylphenol. Phthalate esters, used in the production of various plastics (including PVC), are among the most common industrial chemicals.  Their ubiquity in the environment and tendency to bioconcentrate in animal fat are well known. Neither BBP nor DBP were able to act as antagonists, indicating that, in the presence of endogenous estrogens, their overall effect would be cumulative. Recently, it has been suggested that environmental estrogens may be etiological agents in several human diseases, including disorders of the male reproductive tract and breast and testicular cancers. The current finding that some phthalate compounds and some food additives are weakly estrogenic in vitro, needs to be  supported by further studies on their effects in vivo before any conclusions can be made regarding their possible role in the development of these conditions.

<P><H3><KBD>"The Emasculators" by Dr Charles Tyler.</KBD></H3>

<P><H3><KBD>Originally published in BBC Wildlife Magazine.</KBD></H3>

<P>Male fish producing yolk. Female terns pairing up with each other. A lake’s 
turtles with only one sex among them. Declining sperm counts in pumas, 
belugas and humans. What’s happening to the world’s boys? Dr Charles 
Tyler looked in the water.  
Looking back, I suppose it was obvious from the start that something was 
seriously wrong. Feminised fish were turning up in British rivers, and no one 
knew why. Before long we had a major detective story on our hands – with a plot 
and a named cast of suspects worthy of any conventional whodunit.

<P>It all started with some findings on the roach, a fish whose very name conjures 
up images of lazy summer afternoons on the river. At one site, near a sewage 
outlet on a river in south-eastern Britain, biologists began to find roach with both 
male and female sex organs. Images of summer afternoons rapidly gave way to 
an altogether more disturbing picture. 

<P>When we heard about the findings, my colleague John Sumpter and I suspected 
that the sewage effluent might be harbouring some chemical that was affecting 
sexual development. We found that male fish downstream of the sewage outlet 
were producing a protein normally found only in females – something we had 
already noticed in some other fish populations. The protein in question was 
vitellogenin, a component of the nutritious yolk that females pack into their eggs. 
If males were making it, the natural order was being turned on its head. 
Disconcerting as it was, the discovery gave us an important clue. Female fish 
make yolk protein in response to oestrogen, the sex hormone in their 
bloodstream. Perhaps male fish were making the protein because of some 
chemical in the river with oestrogen-like effects.
John and I felt we had to find out whether male fish were becoming feminised 
elsewhere in the UK. From 1989 to 1991, with help from the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, we placed groups of rainbow trout in rivers at 
more than 20 sites around the country, each of which was below a discharge 
from a sewage-treatment works. When we analysed the blood samples, we 
couldn’t believe our eyes: male rainbow trout at every site had yolk protein in 
their blood - a sure sign of sexual disruption.

<P>Even more remarkable was the amount of yolk protein involved. After just three 
weeks’ exposure, the trout had up to 100,000 times more yolk protein in their 
blood than was normal in male fish – more than half of their blood protein was 
yolk. This was incredible, for these were levels typical of fully mature females. 
To check our findings, we repeated the work with a native fish, the carp. We got 
similar results. Our original discovery was not a one-off: fish populations up and 
down the country were being exposed to oestrogenic chemicals. But what were 
they and where were they coming from? 

<P>As we were piecing together this astonishing story, a similar tale was unfolding 
in the US. Researchers from the US Fish and Wildlife Service were investigating 
a dramatic decline in the alligator population in Lake Apopka, Florida, when they 
found that more than half the juvenile males had abnormally small penises, and 
many had unusual testes. Most of the males were sterile and had abnormally 
high levels of oestrogen in their blood. Turtles from the same lake were faring no 
better, for nearly all were female. Something, it seemed, was feminising the 
lake’s reptiles. 

<P>There was more. On the Pacific coast of the US, western gulls and common and 
roseate terns had also been experiencing problems. The sex ratio had tipped in 
favour of females, and so females were pairing with one another, producing 
large clutches of infertile eggs. Some of the males had developed female sex 
organs, while others had simply lost their sex drive and failed to arrive at the 
breeding colonies.

<P>The mystery deepened further when reproductive anomalies turned up in 
mammals, too. Biologists studying the last remaining Florida cougars (a 
subspecies of puma) reported that males were producing less sperm than they 
should, and what they did produce tended to be abnormal. Not only were the 
cougars having to contend with mercury contamination and a dwindling gene 
pool – there are only 30-50 of them left in the wild – they were also facing a tide 
of feminising pollutants.

<P>As I read more widely, more of these sad tales emerged. Beluga whales at the 
polluted mouth of the St Lawrence River, in Canada, were experiencing 
reproductive problems. Pallid sturgeon in the Missouri and Mississippi rivers 
hadn’t bred in 10 years. Fish in the Great Lakes were being feminised, along 
with the bald eagles. Worldwide, there were declines in populations of 
amphibians and many birds. Could these problems also stem from oestrogenic 
chemicals in the environment? Most of the evidence was circumstantial. What 
we needed was proof that some man-made chemical was responsible. 
We began to search for suspects. One of the first chemicals to come under 
suspicion in our work on fish was a component of the contraceptive pill – the 
man-made oestrogen, ethinyl oestradiol. This compound seemed a good 
candidate because millions of women take the pill in the UK, and it is a very 
powerful substance indeed. Researchers have reported finding it in British river 
water.

<P>But when we tested this theory we found that much of the ethinyl oestradiol 
excreted by women is in a modified form that is inactive in fish, and it seemed 
unlikely that this compound was the cause of the problem. Even so, more 
research will be needed before we can eliminate it from our inquiries, not least 
because of signs that bacteria at sewage works may be able to turn the inactive 
form back into the active form.

<P>Another suspect emerged - quite by chance - from work by Dr Ana Soto at Tufts 
University in the US. Dr Soto was working on breast cancer cells that need 
oestrogen to divide, when she noticed that a substance leaching from plastic 
tubing was stimulating the cells to divide, as though it were an oestrogen. The 
substance was nonylphenol.

<P>Nonylphenol is a breakdown product of a class of chemicals called 
alkylphenolethoxylates (APEOs). APEOs are used mainly in detergents of one 
kind or another, but they turn up in a huge range of other items too, including 
paints, herbicides, food packaging and personal-care products. Industry uses 
about 300,000 tonnes of APEOs every year, 60 per cent of which ends up in the 
water – drinking water included. Nonylphenol is a significant pollutant in some 
UK rivers, particularly those receiving waste from the textile industry.

<P>Sue Jobling, a new recruit to our team, decided to find out whether this 
substance acted as an artificial oestrogen in fish. It did. When male fish were 
exposed to nonylphenol - as well as a number of other breakdown products of 
APEOs - they started to produce yolk protein, and their testes grew more slowly 
than usual. Here at last was some hard evidence. It looked as if nonylphenol and 
its chemical relatives could be responsible, at least in part, for the strange 
effects we had noticed in fish.

<P>But this was only part of the story, for researchers around the world were 
studying a wide range of other chemicals that could mimic oestrogens. In 
Florida, for instance, the unhappy fate of Lake Apopka’s reptiles was attributed 
to a DDT-like insecticide, dicofol, 30,000 gallons of which were accidentally 
released into the lake in 1980. The feminisation of California’s gulls was blamed 
on releases of DDT in industrial waste between 1950 and the mid-1970s. The 
idea that DDT and its chemical relatives could cause these problems was not a 
surprise: more than 30 years ago, intersex mosquitoes started to appear after 
several generations of exposure to DDT.

<P>Other pollutants have now joined the catalogue of suspects. Polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs), for example, are probably responsible for reproductive 
abnormalities in tern colonies on Bird Island, off the Massachusetts coast. PCBs 
are used in sealants, plastics and paints - and something like 20 tonnes enter 
the North Sea annually. Also under suspicion are polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) - chemical contaminants that come from the burning of 
natural fuels and from oil spillages - and some plasticisers. Although 
governments now restrict the use of some of these compounds, huge quantities 
persist in the environment because they resist breakdown by microbes.

<P>Other candidates include oestrogen-like compounds produced by plants and 
fungi. If these substances reach watercourses in large amounts – as could 
happen if cattle slurry passes untreated into a river, say – then they, too, could 
create problems for fish. 

<P>With so many chemicals under suspicion, we realised that animals would 
probably be exposed to a number of oestrogenic compounds at once. This would 
certainly be true of fish in UK rivers. But would the effects of the different 
chemicals be additive, or not? We did some more tests. We found that when 
animals were exposed to a mixture of oestrogenic compounds, the effects of the 
different chemicals were indeed additive. Ecologists, it seems, have to consider 
the entire cocktail of chemicals if they are to understand their potential effects.

<P>To make matters worse, most chemicals that mimic oestrogens have two 
troublesome properties. They tend to build up in the tissues of an animal with 
time, particularly when it spends most of its life in polluted water. They also tend 
to accumulate at the top of food chains. As big fish eat little fish, they take on an 
extra load of oestrogenic pollutants, then pass them on to the creatures that eat 
them – and so on. Some animals end up with levels of pollution 100,000 times 
higher than levels in the environment. Under these conditions, chemicals that 
are only weakly oestrogenic build up to the point where they start having serious 
effects.

<P>Our work has focused on fish and other wildlife, but there are signs that males of 
our own species may also be reacting to oestrogens in the environment. Sperm 
counts have fallen, while reproductive disorders have all increased over the last 
few decades. The reason for these changes is unknown, but exposure to 
environmental pollution by oestrogen-like substances could be playing a part, 
according to Dr Richard Sharpe of the Medical Research Council’s Reproductive 
Biology Unit, Edinburgh, and Professor Niels Skakkebaek of the University of 
Copenhagen. It is well known that oestrogens can affect the developing embryo. 
From the late 1940s to the early 1970s, some pregnant women were treated with 
diethylstilboestrol - a man-made oestrogen - to reduce the risk of miscarriage. 
The drug caused reproductive disorders in babies of both sexes.
The detective story is far from over. There are more than 60,000 man-made 
chemicals in regular use - not to mention their breakdown products – and a 
surprisingly large number are turning out to have oestrogen-like effects. (At least 
one pollutant, tributyl tin from ‘anti-fouling’ paints, is having the opposite effect, 
causing female whelks to develop penises.) There is little doubt that more 
compounds will join the list of suspects as research continues.

<P>And then there is the biggest unknown of them all. We do not yet know whether 
we are dealing with a major global problem or a localised one, affecting specific 
places such as the Great Lakes, toxic dumps and sewage outfalls. We need to 
find out. If it is global, then it is potentially very serious indeed, with huge 
implications for wildlife and humans.



<P><B>FACT FILE 1</B>
<P>Egg-makers

<P>Animals control their physiology by deploying a wide variety of hormones and 
other chemical messengers. Oestrogens govern the development of female 
sexual characteristics and help control reproductive cycles. They belong to the 
great class of steroid hormones and are close cousins of testosterone and 
cortisol. They are produced mainly by the ovary. 

<P>In mammals, the genetic make-up of an individual decides its sex, and the sex 
hormones – testosterone in males, oestrogen in females – reinforce that 
decision. In birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish the situation is rather different. 
Regardless of genetic make-up, individuals develop as females if oestrogen is 
present and as males if it is absent. In these animals, exposure to oestrogen-like 
chemicals during a critical period of development is enough to feminise the 
embryo. Such a ‘female’ may have ovaries and produce eggs, despite being 
genetically male.

<P><B>FACT FILE 2</B>
<P>Hormone hunt

<P>One way of finding out if male fish have been exposed to oestrogen-like 
chemicals is to look for yolk protein in their blood. As part of the normal 
reproductive process, female egg-laying animals make a special yolk protein 
and pack it into their eggs as a food store for their developing young. The 
protein is produced by the liver – in response to oestrogen – then transported to 
the ovary, where it is taken up by the eggs.

<P>Males also have the biochemical machinery for making yolk protein inside the 
liver, but the machinery normally lies idle simply because there is no oestrogen 
to switch it on. But if they are exposed to oestrogens – in polluted rivers, say – 
the machinery switches on and yolk protein builds up in their blood. 

<P>Researchers have developed a second test for checking whether specific 
chemicals act as oestrogens. In some reptiles, sex determination depends on 
temperature; at a high temperature, eggs develop as females, while at a lower 
temperature, they develop as males. (Intermediate temperatures give a mixture 
of males and females.) The test makes use of the fact that eggs exposed to 
oestrogens develop as females, even at a low temperature. The test involves 
painting the eggs with the chemical on trial and then incubating them at a low 
temperature, which normally produces males. If the chemical is oestrogenic, 
then a proportion of the hatchlings will be female.

<P><B>FACT FILE 3</B>
<P>Skeleton keys

<P>Oestrogens are small molecules with large effects. They enter cells with ease, 
where they meet and cling to molecules that act as specific oestrogen 
‘receptors’. As a result of this encounter, the receptors are triggered into an 
active state, whereupon they attach to DNA and switch on certain genes. 

<P>An oestrogen molecule and its receptor are like a key and its lock: only the 
correct key will undo the mechanism. But real locks are vulnerable to anything 
from a skeleton key to a jemmy – and the same seems true of these minute 
chemical structures. Some man-made chemicals ‘unlock’ oestrogen receptors 
because they have a similar structure to oestrogen, and so fit the lock. 
Many environmental pollutants bear no structural relationship to natural 
oestrogens – the key is radically different – and yet they still manage to switch 
on genes that are normally under the control of oestrogen. How they do this is 
still unknown.<P>

<P><H3><KBD>Another DDT connection</KBD></H3>

<P><B>Richard M. Sharpe</B>


<P>As we celebrate the half-centenary of the end of the Second World War in Europe, it will come as a surprise to many readers that the pesticide DDT played a part in the Allied victory.  At the time, DDT was hailed as the new war weapon of the Allies1 because of its ability to kill the lice responsible for the spread of typhoid.  Only 20 or so years later was it realized that DDT was environmentally disastrous, as portrayed in Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.  Now, 50 years on, comes another twist to the story, with the discovery by Kelce and colleagues (page 581 of this issue)2 that p,p'-DDE, the main metabolite of DDT in the body, is a potent anti-androgen.  The fact that this discovery comes at a time of increasing concern about adverse changes in male reproductive health3,4 is a remarkable coincidence.  Or is it more than this? 

<P>There is evidence of a substantial fall in average sperm counts in normal men5 and a progressive increase in incidence of testicular cancer6 over the past half-century.  There is other, although more equivocal, evidence that abnormal development of the penis (hypospadias) and mal-descent of the testes (cryptorchidism) have also increased in incidence4.  It has been hypothesized that all of these changes are interrelated and that they may have a common origin in fetal and/or neonatal life3.  But the veracity of the data on falling sperm counts continues to be disputed7, although a recent study of 1,300 fertile semen donors from the Paris region showed that sperm counts have dropped on average by around 2 per cent each year over the past 20 years8.  In Denmark, where the lifetime risk of a male developing testicular cancer is now nearly 1 per cent, the government has been sufficiently concerned to commission a detailed report4, the findings of which are to be discussed in the Danish parliament in the autumn. 

<P>If these trends are true (and the increase in incidence of testicular cancer is beyond dispute), the cause (or causes) must lie in changes in our environment or lifestyle over the past 50 years.  The most strongly argued case has been that human exposure to a range of weakly oestrogenic chemicals, which are ubiquitous in the environment, is to blame.  This case is based, first, on evidence that exposure of man and animals to inappropriate levels of oestrogens during fetal and neonatal life will result in a spectrum of male reproductive disorders similar to those listed above3,4.  Second, all these oestrogenic chemicals have been introduced into the environment in large amounts during the past 40-60 years4. They include certain detergent breakdown products and various plastics additives and stabilizers. However, it has long been known that one isomer of DDT (o,p'-DDT) and related chlorinated pesticides can also exert oestrogenic effects (so too can some modern pesticides)4.  Oestrogenic ('feminizing') and anti-androgenic ('demasculinizing') effects often manifest themselves in the same way, but work through oestrogen and androgen receptors, respectively. The discovery that p,p'-DDE is a potent antiandrogen means that 'DDT' has the capacity to interact with both receptors. As androgens have a key role in development of the male reproductive tract and in masculinization of the body in the male during fetal life, Kelce et al.2 rightly ask whether p,p'-DDE could be responsible for some or all of the reported adverse trends in male reproductive health. 

<P>Use of DDT has been banned or restricted in most Western countries for 20 or more years, largely because of its persistence (it has a half-life of about 100 years) and its accumulation and concentration in food chains and because of a range of deleterious effects on reproduction in wildlife. DDT is still detectable in us all (mainly in body fat), despite the ban on its use. It is not, however, this present burden of DDT that is the centre of concern; rather it is the level of exposure in the period from the 1940s to the 1960s when it was still in use. Could it have exerted effects then on developing males which have only become apparent in more recent years? To address this possibility we need to know the level of exposure of the general population to DDT (DDE) when it was in use and whether such exposure would be sufficient to cause reproductive defects. 

<P>When first introduced, DDT was used in ways that would be unacceptable now. For example, when Naples was liberated by the Allies in the war, the whole population was 'dusted' with DDT1. Allied soldiers were similarly treated at recruitment and were issued with DDTimpregnated shirts when going overseas. In the tropics DDT was used in mosquito control and in many countries (including Britain) it was used in household flysprays. Today we would not contemplate using one of the safer modern pesticides in many of these ways, let alone a persistent chemical such as DDT. We can only guess what levels of exposure to DDT this led to in the general population, but measurements in dwellings in which DDT was used suggest that this exposure would probably be sufficient to exert significant antiandrogenic effects2. Male alligators in Lake Apopka in Florida contain high levels of p,p'-DDE and have abnormally small penises, amongst other reproductive changes9 . Administration of pharmaceutical anti-androgens (used in the treatment of prostatic cancer) to animals during fetal and neonatal life can result in a range of reproductive tract disorders (small penis, hypospadias, cryptorchidism)l0, although sperm counts and testicular germ cell cancer in adulthood have not been studied. 

<P>If we are currently witnessing the legacy of DDT use in the past, can we at least comfort ourselves with the knowledge that things can only get better? Unfortunately not. Present use of DDT in developing countries (mainly for malarial control) probably exceeds the level of its use historically. Mexico and Brazil each used nearly 1,000 tonnes of DDT in 1992 according to World Health Organization figures. As well as posing a health threat in these countries, the export of DDT through animals, crops and the atmosphere to the countries where its use is now restricted remains likely. And we still have the matter of environmental oestrogens on our doorstep to clear up. 

<P>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the findings of Kelce et al.2 is that it has taken 50 years to discover that the main metabolite of DDT is an anti-androgen. This, coming on top of the recent discoverv of oestrogenicity of several abundant environmental chemicals, must mean that our current methods of testing and surveillance of manufactured chemicals require modification so that the release of 'hormonally active' compounds to the environment can be minimized. For the present, we do not know whether such chemicals pose a significant risk to man because we lack accurate data on the levels and routes of human exposure and on whether, and at what levels, adverse reproductive changes can be induced (in animals). Collecting this information is therefore a priority. Only then will we be in a position to assess whether these chemical skeletons in our cupboards are likely to have contributed to male reproductive disorders.

<!--INSERT TEXT HERE><P><H3><KBD>STATEMENT FROM THE WORK SESSION ON
CHEMICALLY-INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN SEXUAL
DEVELOPMENT: THE WILDLIFE/HUMAN CONNECTION
</KBD></H3>


<P><H4><KBD>THE PROBLEM</KBD></H4>

<P>Many compounds introduced into the environment by human activity are capable of disrupting the endocrine system of animals, including fish, wildlife, and humans. The consequences of such disruption can be profound because of the crucial role hormones play in controlling development. Because of the increasing and pervasive contamination of the environment by compounds capable of such activity, a multidisciplinary group of experts gathered in retreat at Wingspread, Rachle, Wisconsin, 26-28 luly 1991 to assess what is known about the issue. Participants included experts in the fields of anthropology, ecology, comparative endocrinology, histopathology, immunology, mammalogy, medicine, law, psychiatry, psychoneuroendocrinology, reproductive physiology, toxicology, wildlife management, tumor biology and zoology. 

<P>The purposes of the meeting were: 

<P>1. to integrate and evaluate findings from the diverse research disciplines concerning the magnitude of the problem of endocrine disruptors in the environment; 

<P>2. to identify the conclusions that can be drawn with confidence from existing data; and 

<P>3. to establish a research agenda that would clarify uncertainties remaining in the field. 


<P><H4><KBD>CONSENSUS STATEMENT</KBD></H4>

<P>The following consensus was reached by participants at the workshop. 

<P>1. We are certain of the following: 

<P>A large number of man-made chemicals that have been released into the environment, as well as a few natural ones, have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, including humans. Among these are the persistent, bioaccumulative, organohalogen compounds that include some pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides) and industrial chemicals, other synthetic products, and some metals.1 

<P>Many wildlife populations are already affected by these compounds. The impacts include thyroid dysfunction in birds and fish; decreased fertility in birds, fish, shellfish, and mammals; decreased hatching success in birds, fish, and turtles; gross birth deformities in birds, fish, and turtles; metabolic abnormalities in birds, fish, and mammals; behavioral abnormalities in birds; demasculinization and feminization of male fish, birds and mammals; defeminization and masculinization of female fish and birds; and compromised immune systems in birds and mammals. 


<P>The patterns of effects vary among species and among compounds. Four general points can nonetheless be made: (1) the chemicals of concern may have entirely different effects on the embryo, fetus, or perinatal organism than on the adult; (2) the effects are most often manifested in offspring, not in the exposed parent; (3) the timing of exposure in the developing organism is crucial in determining its character and future potential; and (4) although critical exposure occurs during embryonic development, obvious manifestations may not occur until maturity. 

<P>Laboratory studies corroborate the abnormal sexual development observed in the field and provide biological mechanisms to explain the observations in wildlife. 

<P>Humans have been affected by compounds of this nature, too. The effects of DES (diethylstilbestrol), a synthetic therapeutic agent, like many of the compounds mentioned above, are estrogenic. Daughters born to mothers who took DES now suffer increased rates of vaginal clear cell adenocarcilloma, various genital tract abnormalities, abnormal pregnancies, and some changes in immune responses. Both sons and daughters exposed in utero experience congenital anomalies of their reproductive system and reduced fertility. The effects seen in in utero DES-exposed humans parallel those found in contaminated wildlife and laboratory animals, suggesting that humans may be at risk to the same environmental hazards as wildlife. 


<P>2. We estimate with confidence that: 

<P>Some of the developmental impairments reported in humans today are seen in adult offspring of parents exposed to synthetic hormone disruptors (agonists and antagonists) released in the environment. The concentrations of a number of synthetic sex hormone agonists and antagonists measured in the US human population today are well within the range and dosages at which effects are seen in wildlife populations. In fact, experimental results are being seen at the low end of current environmental concentrations. 

<P>Unless the environmental load of synthetic hormone disruptors is abated and controlled, large scale dysfunction at the population level is possible. The scope and potential hazard to wildlife and humans are great because of the probability of repeated and/or constant exposure to numerous synthetic chemicals that are known to be endocrine disruptors. 
As attention is focused on this problem, more parallels in wildlife, laboratory, and human research will be revealed. 


<P>3. Current models predict that: 

<P>The mechanisms by which these compounds have their impact vary, but they share the general properties of (1) mimicking the effects of natural hormones by recognizing their binding sites; (2) antagonizing the effect of these hormones by blocking their interaction with their physiological binding sites; (3) reacting directly and indirectly with the hormone in question; (4) by altering the natural pattern of synthesis of hormones; or (5) altering hormone receptor levels. 

<P>Both exogenous (external source) and endogenous (internal source) androgens (male hormones) and estrogens (female hormones) can alter the development of brain function. 

<P>Any perturbation of the endocrine system of a developing organism may alter the development of that organism: typically these effects are irreversible. For example, many sex-related characteristics are determined hormonally during a window of time in the early stages of development and can be influenced by small changes in hormone balance. Evidence suggests that sex-related characteristics, once imprinted, may be irreversible. 

<P>Reproductive effects reported in wildlife should be of concern to humans dependent upon the same resources, e.g., contaminated fish. Food fish is a major pathway of exposure for birds. The avian (bird) model for organochlorine endocrine disruption is the best described to date. It also provides support for the wildlife/human connection because of similarities in the development of the avian and  mammalian endocrine systems.


<P>4. There are many uncertainties in our predictions because: 

<P>The nature and extent of the effects of exposure on humans are not well established. Information is limited concerning the disposition of these contaminants within humans, especially data on concentrations of contaminants in embryos. This is compounded by the lack of measurable endpoints (biologic markers of exposure and effect) and the lack of multi-generational exposure studies that simulate ambient concentrations. 

<P>While there are adequate quantitative data concerning reduction in reproductive success in wildlife, data are less robust concerning changes in behavior. The evidence, however, is sufficient to call for immediate efforts to fill these knowledge gaps. 

<P>The potencies of many synthetic estrogenic compounds relative to natural estrogens have not been established. This is important because contemporary blood concentrations of some of the compounds of concern exceed those of internally produced estrogens. 


<P>5. Our judgement is that: 

<P>Testing of products for regulatory purposes should be include hormonal activity in vivo. There is no substitute for animal studies for this aspect of testing. 

<P>Screening assays for androgenicity and estrogenicity are available for those compounds that have direct hormonal effects. Regulations should require screening all new products and by-products for hormonal activity. If the material tests positive, further testing for functional teratogenicity (loss of function rather than obvious gross birth defects) using multigenerational studies should be required. This should apply to all persistent, bioaccumulative products released in the past as well. 

<P>It is urgent to move reproductive effects and functional teratogenicity to the forefront when evaluating health risks. The cancer paradigm is insufficient because chemicals can cause severe health effects other than cancer. 

<P>A more comprehensive inventory of these compounds is needed as they move through commerce and are eventually released to the environment. This information must be made more accessible. Information such as this affords the opportunity to reduce exposure through containment and manipulation of food chains. Rather than separately regulating contaminants in water, air, and land, regulatory agencies should focus on the ecosystem as a whole. 

<P>Banning the production and use of persistent chemicals has not solved the exposure problem. New approaches are needed to reduce exposure to synthetic chemicals already in the environment and prevent the release of new products with similar characteristics. 

<P>Impacts on wildlife and laboratory animals as a result of exposure to these contaminants are of such a profound and insidious nature that a major research initiative on humans must be undertaken. 

<P>The scientific and public health communities' general lack of awareness concerning the presence of hormonally active environmental chemicals, functional teratogenicity, and the concept of transgenerational exposure must be addressed. Because functional deficits are not visible at birth and may not be fully manifested until adulthood, they are often missed by physicians, parents, and the regulatory community, and the causal agent is never identified. 


<P>6. To improve our predictive capability: 

<P>More basic research in the field of developmental biology of hormonally responsive organs is needed. For example, the amount of specific endogenous hormones required to evoke a normal response must be established. Specific biologic markers of normal development per species, organ, and stage of development are needed. With this information, levels that elicit pathological changes can be established. 

<P>Integrated cooperative research is needed to develop both wildlife and laboratory models for extrapolating risks to humans. 

<P>The selection of a sentinel species at each trophic level in an ecosystem is needed for observing functional deficits, while at the same time describing the dynamics of a compound moving through the system. 

<P>Measurable endpoints (biologic markers) as a result of exposure to exogenous endocrine disruptors are needed that include a range of effecls at the molecular, cellular, organismal, and population levels. Molecular and cellular markers are important for the early monitoring of dysfunction. Normal levels and patterns of isoenzymes and hormones should be established. 

<P>In mammals, exposure assessments are needed based on body hurdens of a chemical that describe the concentration of a chemical in an egg (ovum) which can be extrapolated to a dose of the chemical to the embryo, fetus, newborn, and adult. Hazard evaluations are needed that repeat in the laboratory what is being seen in the field. Subsequently, a gradient of doses for particular responses must be determined in the laboratory and then compared with exposure levels in wildlife populations. 

<P>More descriptive field research is needed to explain the annual influx to areas of known pollution of migratory species that appear to maintain stable populations in spite of the relative vulnerability of their offspring. 

<P>A reevaluation of the in utero DES-exposed population is required for a number of reasons. First, because the unregulated, large volume releases of synthetic chemicals coincide with the use of DES, the results of the original DES studies may have been confounded by widespread exposure to other synthetic endocrine disruptors. Second, exposure to a hormone during fetal life may elevate responsiveness to the hormone during later life. As a result, the first wave of individuals exposed to DES in utero is just reaching the age where various cancers (vaginal, endometrial breast, and prostatic) may start appearing if the individuals are at a greater risk because of perinatal exposure to estrogen-like compounds. A threshold for DES adverse effects is needed. Even the lowest recorded dose has given rise to vaginal adenocarcinoma. DES exposure of fetal humans may provide the most-severe-effect model in the investigation of the less potent effects from environmental estrogens. Thus, the biological endpoints determined in in utero DES-exposed offspring will lead the investigation in humans following possible ambient exposures. 

<P>The effects of endocrine disruptors on longer-lived humans may not be as easily discerned as in shorter-lived laboratory or wildlife species. Therefore, early detection methods are needed to deterrnine if human reproductive capability is declining. This is important from an individual level, as well as at the population level, because inferlility is a subject of great concern and has psychological and economic impacts. Methods are now available to determine fertility rates in humans. New methods should involve more use of liverenzyme-system activity screening, sperm counts, analyses of developmental abnormalities, and examination of histopathological lesions. These should be accompanied by more and better biomarkers of social and behavioral development, the use of multigenerational histories of individuals and their progeny, and congener-specific chemical analyses of reproductive tissues and products, including breast milk.

<H3><KBD>Where do hormone disrupting chemicals come from and how are they getting into the environment?</KBD></H3>
<P>
There are a large number of synthetic chemicals in the environment that have been identified as potential hormone disrupters, and more are being found as further research is undertaken. Many of these chemicals are very widely used, and the routes by which they get into the environment are varied.
<P>
However two known hormone disrupters that are of particular concern - dioxins and phthalates - have a common source - PVC. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin,or TCDD, is one of the most toxic chemicals known, and phthalates are the most abundant synthetic chemicals in the environment.(1)
<P>
The formation of dioxins is an inevitable result of the oxychlorination process via which 1,2-dichloroethane, and thence vinyl chloride are produced. This process provides ideal conditions for the formation of dioxins. ICI themselves admit that: "it is difficult to see how any of these conditions could be modified so as to prevent PCDD/PCDF (dioxin/furan) formation without seriously impairing the reaction for which the process is designed."(2) Most of these dioxins end up in organochlorine waste which is then buried or incinerated, and others are discharged in effluent.(3)  
<P>
Dioxins are also formed when chlorinated organic compounds, or a mixture of inorganic chloride and organic matter are burned. PVC is a major source of chlorine in municipal waste incinerators (contributing 67% according to the Danish EPA) (4)
<P>
Dioxins resist breakdown in the environment, accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms and concentrate in increasing levels as they pass up through the food chain.
We all now carry significant levels of dioxin in our bodies.
<P>
The second group of hormone disrupting chemicals linked to PVC is the phthalates. They are one of a plethora of additives - plasticisers, colorants, biocides, lubricants, flame retardants, impact modifiers, fillers and stabilisers - that are needed to make PVC usable, in this case they make it flexible.
<P>
Three phthalates - Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) - have been found to be oestrogenic.(5) Others have not yet been tested. They have been shown to reduce sperm counts in rats(6) and are implicated in observed declines in human sperm counts. According to the European Council for Plasticisers and Intermediates 95% of phthalates are used in the production of flexible PVC.(7)
<P>
This link with dioxin and phthalates is one reason why Greenpeace is campaigning for an end to PVC production. 20 million tonnes of PVC is produced every year. It does not biodegrade, it cannot be effectively recycled and it cannot be safely disposed of. Many of the chemicals that are emerging as hormone disrupters are linked  to chlorine production and PVC consumes about one third of all chlorine produced.
<P> 
Alternatives already exist for virtually all uses of PVC. By using these alternatives and phasing out PVC, a major source of hormone disrupting chemicals can be eliminated.

<P>1.Introduction/summary

<P><I>'The quality of mens sperm declined steadily in the early years of the 21st century until hardly anyone could reproduce in the normal way. Meanwhile, the countryside was virtually emptied of animals asnatural populations crashed. The first signs of the impending catastrophe were noted in the 1990's, but few people then believed that a cocktail of pollutants that mimic human hormones could have such profound effects. And so nothing was done until it was too late'</I> (This chilling scenario was hypothesised in the New Scientist, 1995)

<P>Over the last few years, an increasing number of reports have appeared about reproductive problems in both wildlife and humans. Reports of alligators with malformed reproductive organs,(1) feminisation of fish in UK rivers (2) and changes in the mating behaviour of gulls (3) have appeared alongside studies showing a decline in human sperm count and sperm quality,(4) an increase in testicular cancer and genital abnormalities, such as undescended testicles (5), and a rise in the incidence of breast cancer in women. (6)

<P>The conclusion of many of these studies is that man made chemicals in the environment are suspected to be interfering with hormonal systems in both humans and wildlife.(7) Hormones are chemical messengers 
which control or mediate vital bodily functions. The hormonal system regulates the development of vital functions in the foetus including the reproductive organs, the immune system and intelligence and behaviour.

<P>It is our children that are most at risk. Persistent chemicals in the mothers body pass through the placenta to the foetus.(8) The developing foetus is also more susceptible to the adverse effects of any pollutants, 
because it is growing rapidly and is immature in a number of its bodily functions.(9) Many chemicals are also passed through the mothers breast milk to the nursing infant.(10) It has been estimated that an infant which is breast fed for one year will receive between 4 and 12% of its total lifetime exposure to dioxins.(11) As Dr Theo Colborn says in her newly released book Our Stolen Future Children have the right to be born chemical free.(12)

<P>As the evidence about wildlife and human health effects accumulates, the list of chemicals identified as synthetic hormone disruptors has also grown longer. These chemicals can work in different ways; for example, among those that disrupt sex-related functions, many mimic the female hormone oestrogen (and have a feminising effect). Others might be anti-androgens (which would block testosterone and have a demasculinising effect).

<P>Unlike natural hormones, some of these synthetic hormone disruptors build up in body fat, are highly resistant to breakdown, and accumulate through the food chain. Natural hormones are broken down once 
their message has been delivered; persistent hormone pollutants can cause damage over and over again.

<P><a href="#endsadd"><font color="#ff0000">ENDS</font></a> Report 219, April 1993, pp19-21

<P><H2>Spotlight on PVC in the battle over chlorine</H2>


<P><B>Greenpeace has renewed its offensive against the chlorine industry with two reports on 
PVC production. The reports present data from recent studies into releases of dioxins 
and other organochlorines from European PVC plants and warn that there are vital 
gaps in knowledge about the extent and impacts of such emissions. The group has 
already scored one success in persuading the Norwegian authorities to suspend a 
decision to authorise expansion of a PVC plant.</B> 

<P>Global PVC production capacity. the annual CMAI chemical market analysis 
conference in Houston was told recently, will rise from 21 million tonnes in 1991 to 24 
million tonnes by 1997. Almost half of the new capacity is expected to be in expanding 
markets in the Asia-Pacific region. particularly China and India. Their role will be 
particularly critical in absorbing the current surplus of production in the USA, where 
publicity about the environmental impacts of PVC has led to falling sales, particularly 
in packaging. 

<P><B>Key chlorine outlet</B>
<P>These bullish forecasts appear to offer an explanation for Greenpeace's decision to 
home in on PVC in the latest step in its campaign for a ban on all chlorine production 
(ENDS Report 213, pp 15-18). Outlets for chlorine in the manufacture of CFCs, 
chlorinated solvents and bleaching agents are diminishing as recently enacted national 
and international legislation begins to bite. PVC, though, consumes about one third of 
current chlorine production. and the proportion is clearly set to rise with present 
market trends. 

<P>Greenpeace's two reports were released at the PVC industry's  annual conference in 
Brighton at the end of April. They were intended in part as a response to the partial 
life-cycle analysis on PVC published by one of the compound's major producers Norsk 
Hydro, late last year (ENDS Report 215, pp 23-24). 

<P>One of the group's targets is the Paris Commission. Ministers from the North Sea 
countries agreed last September that releases of organohalogens which are toxic, 
persistent and liable to bioaccumulate should be reduced by 2000 to levels that are 
not harmful to man or nature with the aim of their elimination (ENDS Report 212, pp 
29-30). Proposals for action submitted by governments are now being examined by a 
technical working group and a statement of intent may emerge from the Commission's 
annual meeting in June. 

<P>One of the Greenpeace reports constitutes a partial life-cycle analysis of PVC 
summarising the environmental impacts On each stage of its manufacture. The report 
re-emphasises some well-documented problems, such as mercury pollution during 
chlorine production and the difficulties posed during recycling and disposal of PVC 
products due to the substantial quantities of additives employed, some of which are 
now recognised as toxins. On the basis of these inherent problems the group argues 
that PVC manufacture is unlikely ever to be able to fulfil the requirements of cleaner 
production. 

<P><B>Focus on production residues</B>
<P>But it also draws attention to an area of the PVC life-cycle which the group says has 
hitherto been largely overlooked in analyses by industry and government bodies - the 
emissions and residues from production of the feedstocks for PVC, ethylene dichloride 
(EDC) and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). 

<P>Norsk Hydro's report stated that the main emissions from VCM manufacture are 
EDC, VCM, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and copper catalyst residues, for which it 
gave figures for all its plants. The company concedes that there are many other by-
products and many possible emissions from the cracking and oxychlorination 
processes used to produce VCM. but did not elaborate on these. 

<P>Greenpeace says that recent studies of other firms' PVC plants have shown that some 
of these emissions include dioxins and furans. In its second report. Dioxin Factories, 
it lists nine studies around four European PVC plants for organochlorines in sediment, 
diffuse emissions and groundwater. 

<P>The report cites Norsk Hydro's own measurements at Hydro Plast's factory at 
Stenungsund. Sweden, which identified 29 short-chain organochlorines in the tars and 
the light and heavy ends or residues that are separated from EDC and VCM during 
production. 

<P>The figures, which Norsk Hydro has confirmed, reveal that for every 100,000 tonnes 
of VCM output at the factory, by-products include 897 tonnes of chloroform, 687 
tonnes of 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 511 tonnes of tetrachloroethane, 459 tonnes of EDC 
and smaller quantities of other organochlorines, including 150 tonnes of carbon 
tetrachloride. Norsk Hydro says most of these products are destroyed by incineration. 

<P>But Greenpeace argues that given the many PVC production plants operating around 
the world, the amount of data on such emissions is surprisingly small. It points out that 
many of the compounds emitted during VCM manufacture are included in phase-out 
lists in various international environmental treaties, including the 1990 Ministerial 
declaration on the North Sea. 

<P><B>Sediment contamination</B>
<P>One case study reported was carried out by Dutch scientists in 1988 to look at levels 
of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) in the sediments of the Rhine. 
In one stretch of the river, this identified the presence of isomer patterns of PCDFs 
which were unlike those which had been linked to incinerator sources. Subsequent 
investigations revealed a similar pattern of isomers in the gas-phase and residue output 
from an EDC production process involving the oxychlorination of ethylene at an Akzo 
factory in Rotterdam 

<P>Another study of sediment contamination was carried out in 1992 at 13 points along 
the Swedish west coast, including a site outside Norsk Hydro's PVC and EDC/VCM 
facilities at Stenungsund. Conducted by several Swedish research groups the study 
found high levels of hexachlorobenzene and pentachlorobenzene at Stenungsund, both 
of which are listed in the firm's by-product inventory for the site. The site was also 
contaminated with higher levels of octachlorodibenzofurans and 
heptachlorodibenzofurans than the other sampling points. 

<P>A further case study reveals findings by the Norwegian Institute of Air and a parallel 
Swedish study of fugitive emissions from Norsk Hydro's plants at Rafnes in Norway 
and at Stenungsund. Diffuse emissions totalled 66 tonnes and 240 tonnes per year, 
respectively, compared with measured direct emissions of 5.3 and 3.67 tonnes per 
year. These were said to include emissions of ethylene chloride, VCM and EDC. The 
other case studies reported by Greenpeace highlight similar discrepancies in emission 
measurements at Norsk Hydro and Solvay facilities. 

<P><B>Permit decision suspended</B> 
<P>Norsk Hydro's response has been to criticise the assumptions of production quantities 
on which Greenpeace bases several of its calculations. A particular objection is that 
emission quantities are quoted without taking into account the amounts that are 
subsequently incinerated. A spokesman confirmed that Norway's Environment Ministry 
has deferred a decision to approve the expansion of PVC production by 200,000 
tonnes per year at Rafnes until mid August, but said this was for a variety of reasons 
and not due to Greenpeace's activity. 

<P>However. a spokeswoman for the Environment Ministry told ENDS that the decision 
had been postponed directly as a result of the evidence presented by Greenpeace. She 
said the reports have been sent to the State Pollution Control Authority, while the 
Ministry itself will be looking at national and international reports of pollution around 
PVC plants. She could not at this stage say whether Norsk Hydro would be required 
to carry out further investigations of its own production facilities. 

<P>Greenpeace accepts in its report that the case studies do not represent a conclusive 
case against PVC. But the group says it will circulate the evidence to environmental 
protection agencies in other countries with PVC industries simply to highlight the 
unknown quantities in assessing the environmental impacts of PVC. At the very least it 
wants a halt in expansions of EDC/VCM and PVC capacity until further independent 
studies of releases have been carried out. 

<P>The European trade association of chlorine manufacturers and users, EuroChlor, has 
responded to the campaign with a non specific statement reiterating the importance of 
PVC and other plastics in many everyday products. EuroChlor points to everyday 
sources of dioxins such as bonfires, cigarette smoke and vehicle exhausts in addition to 
the relatively low emissions from industrial processes. And it added that claims that 
PVC production leads to harmful levels of dioxins and organochlorines are both 
alarmist and misleading. Both the chlorine industry and the PVC industry are 
committed to modem processes and monitoring technologies which ensure that 
emissions from plants are kept within statutory limits.The whiff of chlorine, it seems, 
is prompting the participants in the debate to dig themselves into ever deeper trenches.

<P>Press release from Greenpeace Sweden Nov 95

<H3>Swedish Parliament demands rapid phaseout of PVC 

</H3>
<P>STOCKHOLM, 23 November 1995 - Greenpeace has hailed the decision, of the 
Swedish Parliament to phase out the toxic, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a 
momentous decision for the future of the planet and future generations: 

<P>The proposal, submitted by the Committee for Agriculture, stated that an overall 
assessment shows that PVC cannot be part of an eco-cycle society, current plasticised 
as well as rigid PVC with environmentally harmful 'additives' should therefore be 
phased out. The phaseout should begin speedily.

<P>"The Swedish Parliament has taken seriously the harmful effects to human health of 
chlorine based substances and has taken real steps, to address the problem", said Matts 
Knapp of Greenpeace Sweden, "It is now time for other countries to do the same and 
work towards the total phaseout of PVC and chlorinated substances world-wide". 

<P>At a hearing on chlorine and chlorinated compounds arranged by the Swedish Ministry 
for Environment prior to the vote, the Swedish Minister for Environment, Anna Lindh 
stated: "It is no longer a question of if PVC should be phased out but how it shall be 
phased out." 

<P>Greenpeace has been campaigning for the phaseout of chlorine based substances such 
as PVC for many years, added Knapp; "This is a tremendous step for the future of our 
planet". The Swedish Chemical Inspectorate and the Swedish EPA will now 
investigate how to phase out PVC based on the Ecocycle Commission's report of 
1993. They are due to present their findings to the Ministry for Environment in June 
1996. 

<P>The text from parliament also includes statements on the production, use, waste 
treatment etc. These are a few excerpts: 


<P>On production: 

<P>...the chlorine manufacture for PVC production puts a burden on the environment 
through emissions of organochlorines, releases of mercury and high energy 
consumption. Several of the light and heavy waste streams from the actual PVC 
manufacture is highly contaminated with dioxins and other undesirable 
organochlorines. There are also diffuse organochlorine emissions from the production 
facility. Based on this, the government and relevant authorities should take the 
opportunity to decrease the negative environmental impact from chlorine production 
and the PVC manufacture itself.


<P>On recycling: 

<P>. . .The committee does not rule out the possibility that PVC can be recycled in the 
future. Material recycling of PVC using current techniques cannot be recommended. It 
should be the responsibility of the manufacturer wanting to initiate recycling to prove 
that it will not cause unacceptable environmental consequences. It should then depend 
on the relevant authority to assess and approve a proposed material recycling scheme.  


<P>On land disposal: 

<P>... conventional disposal is an inappropriate treatment method for older PVC waste 
containing hazardous substances. Conventional disposal is neither acceptable for worn-
out, or newer PVC products with hazardous components. Plasticisers and stabilisers 
will gradually be released and may be spread in the environment. The effects of this 
have not been investigated. Neither has it been investigated which degradation 
products are created in the longer term from the PVC polymer itself. 


<P>On incineration: 

<P>...When PVC is incinerated, most of the plasticisers are destroyed while heavy metals 
from stabilisers are collected in residues. The chlorine content of the incinerated waste 
causes risks from dioxin formation. Because of the chlorine content in the waste. 
special treatment steps are required for treatment of the flue gases and corrosive 
protection equipment in the incinerators. The committee is of the opinion that 
incineration, because of the low energy content in PVC waste, should only be seen as a 
short term option and should therefore decrease. 


<P>On labelling: 

<P>...All new PVC products and other chlorinated plastics should be labelled to make 
separation for recycling of other thermoplastics and waste treatment easier.

<P>Summary of research paper in<H3><B>SCIENCE, Vol 272, 7 June 1996.</B></H3>
by Mark Strutt, Greenpeace UK.

<p>This issue of <i>Science</i> contains a paper by <a href="cemac01.html">Arnold <i>et al.</i></a>from Tulane University in New Orleans, which reports that mixtures of weakly oestrogenic compounds were between 160 and 1600 times  more potent than the  individual chemicals in the mixture (p.1490). 

<p>The paper inspires two further commentaries in the same issue: one by Jocelyn Kaiser (p.1418) who believes that the findings are causing scientists to take a fresh look at an already "hot topic". The second article (Perspectives p.1451) points out that "We all want to know whether substances in our environment are harmful to us and other animals. But answering this question is no easy task." The author asks "How should the risk of new chemicals be assessed?" Unfortunately the answer to this question is not pursued.

<p>Arnold et al. report that "abnormal sexual development in reptiles (1, 2) or birds (3) as well as feminised responses in male fish (4 - 6) have suggested an association with environmental chemicals functioning as estrogens." Likewise hormone disrupting chemicals have been implicated in increased risk of breast cancer (7, 8) and observed decreases in human semen quality (9,10). Whilst it has been  maintained that these compounds, because of their low potency, are unlikely to have similar effects on humans (11, 12) the combined action of hormone disrupting chemicals has been given very little attention. It is this area that Arnold et al have addressed. 

<p>The researchers used genetically engineered yeast cells to investigate the interaction of a mixture of  chemicals with human oestrogen receptor. They used four pesticides believed to be only weakly oestrogenic; dieldrin, endosulfan, toxaphene and chlordane. When tested individually they yielded little response as expected. But when paired their oestrogenic activity shot up by an a factor of 160 to 1600. A result which one of the authors, John McLachlan, described as "really quite astounding" (p. 1418). Importantly the research was repeated using PCB's and human cells. A five fold increase in oestrogenic response of human endometrial cells to combinations of PCB's was demonstrated. This is the same result they got with PCB's in the yeast system and shows that observed oestrogenic effects were not specific to yeast cells.

<p>McLaughlan is quoted (p 1418) as saying that the team worked with "levels [of environmental estrogens] actually achieved in some systems" (such as turtle eggs and the serum of women with breast cancer). 

<p>The report concludes that "....the addition of weakly estrogenic PCB congeners to developing turtle eggs resulted in sex reversal of  male-determined eggs; addition of two PCB's at sub-threshold concentrations were effective. Likewise, dieldrin, endosulfan, or toxaphene, although only marginally effective in stimulating proliferation of human breast cancer cells in culture, exhibited greater than additive effects when administered together. Apparently synergistic estrogenic effects of environmental chemicals were observed in cultures of fish hepatocytes. Our data...suggest that the estrogenic potency of some environmental chemicals, when tested singly, may be underestimated".

<P><KBD><a href="#endsadd"><font color="#ff0000">ENDS</font></a> Report 257, June 1996.</KBD>

<P><H2><KBD>Phthalate scare drives retailers to review use of PVC </KBD></H2>

<P><B>Five major retailers have pooled resources to investigate the environmental and health effects of PVC in the wake of public concern about the health risks posed by phthalates - chemicals used as plasticisers in flexible PVC. The group intends to apply the precautionary principle, and will set strategies and timetables for phasing out PVC if necessary.</B> 

<P>The health risks posed by oestrogenic chemicals were pushed up the agenda in May following the detection of phthalates in baby formula milk by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF) (ENDS Report 255, pp 5-6). 

<P>Also in May, the British Retail Consortium's environment committee heard presentations on PVC from Greenpeace and the British Plastics Federation (BPF) in response to requests for more information from members. A few months earlier, Greenpeace had written to major retailers urging them to stop using PVC as part of its wider campaign against chlorine (ENDS Report 229, pp l5-l7). PVC is the single largest market for chlorine, accounting for one-third of use. 

<P>In June, five major retailers - The Body Shop, Tesco, Lloyds Chemists, IKEA and the Co-op - agreed to set up an ad hoc working group to examine the "increasing public concern over PVC and the impact of dioxins and phthalates on human health and the environment." 

<P>The firms say that they will "adopt a precautionary/riskbased approach." They will initially concentrate on packaging, and then move on to applications such as building materials and cables which are of less concern to the consumer. "Timetables and strategies for phasing out PVC from retail applications with significant risk will be considered" if necessary. 

<P>The Body Shop - which, along with IKEA, has already removed PVC from items for retail sale - has led the group to date. Dr David Wheeler, Environmental Affairs Manager for Body Shop International, says that the company will invite other retailers which "recognise the problem" to join the group and "stick by its solutions". 

<P>Although the baby milk furore brought phthalates to the attention of consumers, the product is not packaged in PVC and it is not known how the samples analysed by MAFF became contaminated. The BPF says that phthalates are not used in any PVC food packaging or wrapping manufactured in the UK. It is unclear whether the chemicals are present in imported food packaging or non-food packaging. 

<P>Concern is growing among retailers about oestrogenic chemicals in products. Sainsbury's, for example, intends to investigate whether packaging for it's own brands contains phthalates or other hormone-disrupting chemicals, and will also identify PVC uses outside food packaging.

<P>Boots set up a working party on oestrogenic chemicals earlier this year, but is not convinced that flexible PVC is a major contributor to the problem. "There is a wealth of scientific evidence showing that there is a whole range of oestrogenic chemicals out there. We have to be absolutely sure that any action we take is the most effective way to reduce these effects,"  said Environmental Manager Belinda Howell.

The Guardian, Tuesday 18th June 1996

<P><H2><KBD>Tesco and IKEA join Greenpeace attack on the dangers of PVC </KBD></H2>
<P>
Roger Cowe
<HR width=50% align left><BR>

<P>A group of leading retailers, including Tesco and IKEA, will today join the attack on the plastic PVC as part of a long running campaign by the environmental group Greenpeace.
<P>Tesco is expected to join IKEA, Lloyd's chemists and Body Shop in announcing that PVC should be treated with caution and will investigate the elimination of the plastic from all retail uses which carry a risk to consumers, such as in packaging and building applications.
<P>This latest threat to PVC, one of the biggest products of the chlorine industry, comes after the recent scare concerning phthalates in baby milk. These are chemicals which make PVC pliable for use in conveyor belts and other flexible plastic products. They have been implicated in a number of medical disorders, at levels well above those found in government tests on baby milk.
<P>Flexible PVC is no longer used as food packaging, removing the direct threat from phthalates, but Greenpeace says there are many other dangers from rigid PVC, which is widely used in the grocery business.
<P>Sarah Burton of Greenpeace said last night: "We are particularly concerned about dioxins, which are released when PVC is incinerated, and which are also gender benders."

<P><KBD><a href="#endsadd"><font color="#ff0000">ENDS</font></a> Report 257, June 1996.</KBD>

<P><H2><KBD>Phthalates scare subsides amidst Euro-confusion </KBD></H2>

<P><B>The public concern which erupted in May over phthalates in baby formula milk was calmed after the European Commission supported an assessment by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF) that they pose no risk to health. However, the opinion from Brussels was not based on any scientific assessment - but an EC committee which reviewed the data in June came to less reassuring conclusions about the safety of phthalates in food and the environment.</B> 

<P>The scare began several weeks after MAFF published data on phthalates in baby milk and other foods (ENDS Report 255, pp 5-6). ENDS concluded that babies' intake of all phthalates would be above a precautionary limit set by the EC's Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). The doses of one compound, butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), were within a factor of ten of doses shown to reduce the testis size and sperm counts of developing rats in a study carried out by Dr Richard Sharpe (ENDS Report 251, pp 8-9). 

<P>The story was picked up by the press in May and dominated the media for a week. The scare prompted the European Commission's Industry Directorate, DGIII, to ask MAFF for the data for circulation to other Member States. 

<P>However, after considering the data for only a day, DGIII announced that it agreed with MAFF's findings that there was no risk to babies' health. A Reuters article on 31 May quoted spokesman Jochen Kubosch as saying: "[Commission researchers] see no reason to say that there is any risk," and "after checking what [MAFF] found in the study, we agree with them." A document in French obtained ,by ENDS from the Commission's London office also claimed that the MAFF data had been "analysed by its experts." 

<P>However, when contacted by ENDS, Mr Kubosch denied that there had been any statement. He  said that all DGIII had done was to circulate the information to Member  States. "It was just an information procedure, not a decision procedure," he said.  Nonetheless, the messages coming from DGIII were widely interpreted by the media as an all-clear and coverage quickly subsided. However, when told that his statements had suggested there had been an independent scientific assessment,
 Mr Kubosch said: "It seems there is  some misunderstanding here. I don't  want to comment on that."  Scientific scrutiny of the MAFF  report was not undertaken until the  SCF met on 7 June. In a statement  after the meeting, the SCF said that it
 was "inappropriate" to compare the total phthalate levels found by MAFF
with the SCF's precautionary limit for all phthalates. The SCF said that 
there are uncertainties over which phthalates might be measured by MAFF's
methods and what the toxicological properties of such mixtures might be.

<P>The SCF added that it was important for Dr Sharpe's work, which showed that low doses of BBP can harm developing rats, to be followed up. His findings "suggest that reproduction could be affected...by exposure during prenatal and early postnatal life, but require confirmation," it concluded. In the meantime, it expressed the view that BBP levels in baby milk were "unlikely" to pose a risk to health. 


<P>The SCF concluded by calling for more data on phthalates in food and improved analytical methods. It also asked "appropriate bodies" to consider the ubiquitous contamination of the environment by phthalates. 

<P>Public reaction to phthalates in baby milk appears to have been as strong in Denmark and the Netherlands as in the UK. 

<P>The Danish Ministry of Health told ENDS that a debate on oestrogenic chemicals has bee,n under way in the press for some time. The Ministry is planning to repeat the phthalate analyses with products on the Danish market. 

<P>The Dutch Ministry of Health also said that there had been much media reaction and it had plans to do its own research into infant phthalate intakes. The levels of BBP found by MAFF gave cause for concern, according to the Ministry, and Dr Sharpe's experiments should be repeated to establish a dose-response relationship for the compound.

RICHARD SHARPE<BR><P><B>‘There should be more accuracy in public utterances on health-scare issues, but in the present climate this would be a disaster’.</B><P>In the past few weeks, I have struggled to find superlatives which adequately describe my incredulity over the media and public reaction to, first BSE, and last week to phthalates in baby milk. <P>Has the rest of Britain gone mad, or is it me? Although I'm sure that scientists in many disciplines will share my reactions, I have the additional burden that it is some of my work that has been used to fuel the public panic on the phthalates. <P>The fact that I see no great problem with the phthalates in baby milk means that somebody is seriously out of line - but is it me or is it the media? To answer this question, without arrogant presumption, takes us into the poorly explored realms of the different perspectives of the scientist and layman about risks and "the truth". <P>To the public, science is about facts. Facts = certainty = "the truth". To a scientist, "facts" are more flexible; they are pieces of data which can often be interpreted in more than one way. <P>So most "facts" are not 100 per cent certain. This is because a scientist knows that. with time, a "fact" will prove to be only part of the truth, not the whole truth. <P>As a result, we scientists speak always in qualified terms, for example describing something as being "more likely" or "highly probable" or "highly unlikely". For a scientist to be more definite would be dishonest, because we know that certainty is a rare commodity. <P>This does not mean that we spend our lives sitting on the fence. We take the available "facts", put them together and construct a possible explanation (a hypothesis) which we then test - usually to destruction - and then repeat the process ad infinitum. So "the facts" and our understanding are forever changing, but improving. <P>The gulf between scientific reality and public perception is even wider regarding risk. I can illustrate this by showing how I, as a scientist, would go about assessing the risk from phthalates in baby milk. <P>I look at my data showing which level of intake of one phthalate in laboratory rats can result in a 10 per cent decrease in sperm production, and I see that this level is l0 - 100 times higher than the levels of this phthalate in baby milk powder reported by the Ministry of Agriculture. <P>At face value, this suggests already that the risk to infants is very low, but I also have to take into account many other factors which I, as an expert know about, not least of which are the inadequacies of my own data (assessment of risk is usually based on much more data). <P>Based on all this and my overall understanding, I can then estimate risk and I conclude that the "risk is minimal". Unfortunately, phrases such as this present a goldmine to journalists looking for a story. They reinterpret this as meaning that there really is some risk. But remember, to a scientist there is no such thing as "no risk", only levels of risk. Driving a car carries a moderate risk of injury, but we all accept it and drive; smoking carries an enormous risk to health, but millions choose to take it.<P>Compared with these, the risk from phthalates in milk powder, or of BSE from eating beef, are infinitesimal based on the available data. Unfortunately, the latter phrase, though scientifically accurate, can be reworked by any journalist to mean almost anything. <P>So who is right? The scientist or the journalist? And remember that public perception of science is based mainly on how non-expert journalists present it. I have little doubt on this issue. <P>The scientist tells the truth as he or she sees it, which amounts to his informed judgment based on the known facts, which he can expertly weigh and assess. In contrast, the non-scientist journalist is interpreting what the scientist says or, worst of all, is trying to please his editor. <P>Time, and new data, may show that the scientist got it wrong, but he told the truth as it was at the time. So believe the scientist before you believe the journalist - and, of course, before you believe the politician. <P>If an independent scientist says that he thinks a risk is minimal, this is what he really believes based on "facts". If a journalist or a politician makes such a pronouncement, then you should be sceptical, as they may not be basing what they say on facts but on the need to fill the front page, protect some sector of industry or to score political points. <P>So how can the general public tell whether a public pronouncement which they hear or read is accurate? An easy guide - if phrases such as "no doubt" and "absolutely certain" are used, then it will be departing from the scientific facts; the first pronouncement on BSE, "absolutely no risk of transmission to man", is a classic example. <P>I feel strongly that there should be more accuracy (that is, more uncertainty) in public utterances on health-scare issues. Unfortunately, in the present climate this would be a colossal disaster for two reasons. <P>First because the public has been desensitised by the gross exaggeration and misrepresentation of scientific data in the form of scares about salmonella and eggs, thrombosis and the new contraceptive pills, and the recent BSE and phthalate fiascos. <P>Second, because the public has not been informed how to judge relative risk. There are no quick solutions to the latter problem, but I think that responsible, informed journalism is the only way to reach the public. <P>This means putting the scary skeletons back in the cupboard and trying to help educate and inform the public on health issues in an honest rather than alarmist way. <P>To carry on as at present is to insult the common sense of the general public, who know that things cannot be as bad as the media are making out. It also means that scientists will stop talking to the media - I now decline eight out of 10 such invitations because I no longer trust the motives of most journalists: And yet, if we scientists stop talking to the media, how can we keep the public informed, which is surely our duty? <P>So the challenge for the media is: Do you really want to inform the public accurately, or do you only want to scare them? <P>The choice can be only yours, but if you want to continue to talk to me and to other scientists freely and openly, then you have got to put your house in order. I want no part of this misinformation fiasco. The public deserves "the truth" with all its shades of grey. <P>And a different challenge for politicians: when scientists express concern, such as over BSE several years ago, don't just presume that their sole motive is to get more research money. Their concern is based on "facts", which may or may not turn out to be the truth. <P>Whichever this should be, to ignore it is to be unwise and, as BSE has illustrated, can result in enormous cost to the country. All for the want of a small shrewd investment, not in industry, but in some half-decent “fact”-finding research. <P>As with everything in life, what you get out is directly proportional to what you put in, and the same is true of scientific research. There are plenty of health-scare storms out there brewing and only "facts", even with all their uncertainty, will quell those which are imagined and prepare us to respond to the infrequent real storm. <P><B>Dr Richard Sharpe has been a leading figure in studies of male infertility and the decline in sperm counts. He conducts research with the MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh. </B></td></tr></table></center></body></HTML>

<P><H3><KBD>Now breast milk faces tests in poison alert</KBD></H3>


<P><B>By Ian Burrell and Alistair Law<BR>
</B>


<P>Scientists have begun urgent tests of human breast milk amid fears it contains the same 
potentially harmful chemicals discovered last week in powdered baby milk. 

<P>The probe was ordered following the scare over phthalates, a range of organic 
chemicals which can impair fertility. 

<P>European health officials who had demanded details of the brands of British powdered 
milk involved said later that their was no risk to babies.

But 200 mothers around Britain have now been asked by scientists from the Ministry 
of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) to submit samples of their breast milk for 
analysis.

<P>The study is being conducted in conjunction with the Medical Research Council at a 
Laboratory in leicester and will take at least nine months to complete.

<P>No previous testing of human milk for phthalates has been conducted and government 
officials want to be sure that levels of the chemicals are within recognised safety limits.

<P><B>Chemicals</B>
<P>Mothers may have absorbed phthalates into their milk through food and water. The 
high fat content of breast milk is likely to be a factor in increasing the prevelance of the 
chemicals.

<P>MAFF was severely criticised for not publishing the names of nine powdered babyfood 
brands found to contain phthalates. One minister claimed the public did not need to 
know about the risks.

<P>"There is no need to talke any action - if there was I would tell you" said Agriculture 
Minister Tim boswell.

<P>But, as details of the breast milk tests emerged, scientists attacked the Governments 
handling of the issue. Gwynne Lyons, a scientific adviser on the 'round table'
committee investigating environmental contaminants - including phthalates - said 
politicians must face up to the perils these chemicals posed. 

<P>"This issue must not be covered over the way the government has done this week," she 
said. "We must do more research and build in much greater safety margins. We cannot 
afford to be complacent."
                                
<B>
                         
<P>    LEVELS OF PHTHALTES FOUND PER kg</B>
    
                             <BR> 31.4 mg     Gravy granules and parmesan cheese
                                       <BR>  4.95 mg   Fats
                                       <BR>  2.9 mg     Confectionary  
                                      <BR>   2.2 mg     Meat and Fish products
                                       <BR>  0.46 mg   Bakery products
                                      <BR>  0.26 mg   Pasta and cerials
                                       <BR>  0.2   mg   Poultry
                                       <BR>  0.18 mg   Baby milk formula
                                       <BR>  0.1   mg   Eggs
                                       <BR>  0.09 mg   Carcass meat
                                       <BR>  0.02 mg   Dried fruits
                                       <BR>  0.003mg  Milk

<P>The safety level for a baby of 4 kilograms (9 pounds) would be 0.2 milligrams of       
phthalte per day (more than a kilogram of baby milk). For an adult weighing 64   
kilograms (10 stones) the safe level is 3.2 milligrams of the chemical per day.
                                                                 Source: MAFF Food Safety Directorate      

<P>Concern over contaminants in human milk is now threatening to eclipse the fears for 
the safety of manufactured milk.

<P>The breast milk tests coincide with government findings that mothers' milk contains 
alarming levels of dioxin, a highly toxic carcinogen produced by waste incineration and 
motor vehicles.

<P>A report completed last week by the MAFF Food Safety Directorate in more than 100 
mothers from Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge were nearly 70 times above the 
safety limit.

<P>The potential dangers of phthalates, used to make plastics more flexible, emerged in 
1972 when scientists speculated on their risk to the reproductive system.  In 1985 the 
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in America conducted tests on 
powdered baby milk. 

<P>Levels of phthalates were similar to those found in Britsh baby milk last week. But in 
contrast to Britain, the results were made public and millions of dollars spent 
identifying the source of the contamination and removing plastics used in packaging.

<P>Dr Michael Bolger, chief of the FDA's contaminants branch, said: "The (phthalate) 
levels in infant formulae in the U.S. are now below detectable level.

<P><H3><KBD>The 5 million ton plastic peril in food</KBD></H3>


<P><B>Tim Radford reports on the unknown effects of phthalates, whose toxic properties have been worrying environmentalists for about 10 years </b><BR>

<P>IN 1989 a scientist pointed out that there was a little problem with a label that said "environmentally friendly" on vegetables for sale. The labels had been plasticised with a class of chemical called a phthalate to make it stick to the plastic film that protected them. 

<P>Phthalates and similar chemicals have been around for as long as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is rigid unless treated with something to make it plastic, and about half of all the PVC on the planet has been plasticised with a phthalate. John Emsley, author of The Consumer's Good Chemical Guide, says a plasticiser can make up to half the weight of a plastic bag or washing up bowl. 

<P>This, he says "has sometimes proved a problem: When it is in contact with fatty foods, such as certain types of cheese, the plasticiser can migrate from the plastic film to the product." 

<P>Phthalates are clear oily liquids which carry pigments and catalysts and which also give flexibility to cellulose acetate and other plastics. They exist in certain kinds of bleaches, and in all sorts of domestic objects - carpet edgings, vinyl floorings, paint, hose pipes, margarine tubs, food wrappers, polypropylene pot plants and so on. The world output of phthalates is reckoned to be 5 million tons a year.

<P>Phthalates have been worrying environmentalists for about 10 years: vapours from di-ethyl phthalate have been found to be toxic to clover, aster, tobacco, broad beans, roses and alfalfa. 

<P>Japanese chemical companies banned certain chemicals such as di-butyl phthalate 20 years ago, and used the apparently less problematic di-ethyl-hexyl phthalate instead. This is the one used for making PVC bags for storing blood for transfusions, and for medical catheters. 

<P>When fed in large quantities to mice, this phthalate caused cancer, but most scientists believe this doesn't reveal much about the risk to humans. The maximum acceptable daily intake for humans has been set in Europe at 25 milligrams per kilogram. 

<P>In recent years phthalates have been linked with another threat, to fertility. They "mimic" the effect of natural plant oestrogens and have been implicated in birth defects in animals and in falling sperm counts in men.  

<P>But this evidence, too, is confusing: male sperm counts appear to be falling steadily in Britain and parts of Europe but not in crowded, urban parts of the US like New York. 

<P>The other catch is that phthalates are not the only chemicals supposed to mimic or interfere with human sex hormone; others are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs), dioxins and organochlorine pesticides. 

<P>The real problem is that scientists know remarkably little about the potential long-term effects of many manmade chemicals. 

<P>More than 7 million have been identified and more than 80,000 are in widespread use. Some occur in huge quantities. Humans for instance pump 25,000 tons of arsenic and 10,000 tons of mercury from exhausts and factory chimneys, into the air each year, and nobody knows what these two dangerous toxic metals are doing to human health. 

<P>Man-made chemicals are everywhere - they have been measured in the snows of Greenland and the Antarctic and on the ocean bottom - and ever subtler detection systems have made them easier to find. But it is one thing to round up the suspects, an other thing to pin down the guilty and make the charge stick.

<P>Copyright SCI. Reproduced by permission.
This article was originally published in Chemistry & Industry, 6 May 1996.

<P><img src="../icons/c&imag.gif">           

<P>At the <a href="http://ci.mond.org"><font color ="#FF0000"> Chemistry and Industry web site</font></a></font>  you will find daily environmental news, a jobs database, meeting
announcements, and many more articles about chemically-related environmental issues.


<P><BR><H3><KBD><P>Another chemical balls-up? </KBD></H3>


<P><I>There is no conclusive evidence that synthetic hormone mimics are harmful. But industry should curb their use now anyway, before customers and governments do so.</I> 


<P>Like a genitally deficient alligator lurking in Lake  Apopka, Florida, concern about the effects of synthetic chemicals on sexual hormones in humans and wildlife is an issue about to take a painful bite out of the chemical industry's backside. Launched last week in Europe, and a month ago in the US, a book describing research on hormone mimics, Our Stolen Future, is the most visible milestone so far in what is turning into
another awkward episode in the industry's history (see page 316).


<P>Compared favourably by US vice-president Al Gore to Silent Spring, Rachel Carson's 1962 bestseller about pesticides, Our Stolen Future eloquently describes research which supports (but doesn't prove) a biologically plausible hypothesis, and leaves many questions unanswered. The research shows that a variety of synthetic chemicals (natural ones too, though it says less on those) can disrupt hormonal signals in animals. This can lead to scrambled sexual organs, sexual dysfunction and disease, bizarre behaviour and other unpleasant effects (see C&l 1995, 575). Research also shows that, in the case of humans, sperm counts are declining (see C&l 1996, 156), and testicular and breast cancers are increasing. The prevalence of undescended testes may also be, as they say, on the rise. 

<P>What is unproven and possibly unprovable, as the book's authors admit, is the hypothesis that the synthetic hormone mimics cause a multitude of environmental ills, that even vanishingly low levels of these chemicals are harmful, and that there is a serious human health and fertility hazard from those chemicals currently still in widespread use. 

<P>Nevertheless, the authors highlight studies that support the hypothesis, and give little or no mention to those that don't. From this, they conclude that exposure to synthetic hormone disrupters should be curtailed. The book is clearly one-sided, but that is its raison d 'etre: to put the case for action now. 

<P>Industry's sensible response - 'there's no evidence' and 'we're going to do some research'-is reminiscent of its forlorn defence of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Reasonable, yes; persuasive, no. The parallels with ozone depletion, heavily signposted in Our Stolen Future, are not lost on vice-president Gore: 'It is now clear that we waited too long to ask the right questions about the CFCs that eventually attacked the ozone layer.' 

<P>If the industry believes its own tired rhetoric on sustainable development, self-regulation and better public relations (see page 325), it will have to make more effort than it did with CFCs to respond in a credible fashion. For one thing, it is critical to avoid even inadvertently suggesting that 'no evidence of harm' some how equals 'evidence of no harm'. Equating the two, if only by implication, is just as misleading as the environmentalists' exaggerations. 

<P>There is a better way for industry: get ahead of the issue, not behind it. First, start looking now for the most cost-effective first steps to eliminate or reduce exposure to some putative hormone disrupters, and take these as soon as they are identified. This would provide encouraging evidence that companies are capable of  'responsible care' (in the generic sense), and take momentum out of calls for mandatory bans. (In any case, consumer marketing people will drive these changes even faster than the regulators: 'phthalate free' and 'hormone-friendly' labels will soon sprout in the supermarkets.) 

<P>Second, find new people to run the industry's public relations in Europe. Response to this issue is too little, too late, and too unsophisticated. CEFIC, the European chemical trade federation, has a lamentable lack of information to offer. Oestrogen mimics have been bubbling inexorably to the top of the public agenda for at least four years now (see C&l 1992, 88), plenty of time to cobble together more than some excuses about the difficulty of coordinating an industry view. 

<P>Third, put substantial funding and a sense of urgency into answering all those questions that stretch across the gaps in the data. The industry is already making slow but welcome progress here, with funding available in the US and on its way in Europe. 

<P>In the end, the outcome of this issue revolves around interpretation of the 'precautionary principle'. How much evidence do we need before we act? Companies, understandably, would like conclusive proof; consumer zealots and environmental extremists want to ban all remotely suspicious chemicals now. 

<P>The problem with hormone disrupters, as with other global environmental issues, is that conclusive evidence won't be found soon, if at all. The authors of Our Stolen Future advocate a new approach to risk assessment they call 'eco-epidemiology', in which a roomful of smoking guns mostly pointing at the dead body in the corner are sufficient for action, even if no one sees the bullets fly. Other responsible environmental and health scientists, but not all, also subscribe to a similar 'weight of evidence' philosophy. 

<P>Governments and industry should take this philosophy on board and take prudent, cost-effective, voluntary steps first. Assigning priorities for such action sensibly, of course, hinges partly on facts about these chemicals that are still unknown: for example, their relative potencies and total human exposures. But these unknowns are no excuse for lengthy delay.

<P><H3><KBD>Chemical threat to intelligence</KBD></H3>


<P><B>NICHOLAS SCHOON<BR>
<P>Environment Correspondent</B>


<P>Our intelligence, good behaviour and ability to reproduce are all under threat from the postwar boom in mass-produced synthetic chemicals, argues a best-selling book published in Britain this week. 

<P>Our Stolen Future explains how man-made substances which mimic our natural hormones, or disrupt their normal workings, have caused chaos among wild animal populations. 

<P>But there is growing evidence that they are also lowering human sperm counts and disrupting the normal development of babies' brains in the womb. The  book's three authors claim a substantial part of the population may already be suffering lowered intelligence, learning difficulties and attention deficits because of these chemicals, which exert their effects at extremely  low concentrations.

<P>The book has been compared with Silent Spring, Rachel Carson's 1962 warning about how DDT and other pesticides were wiping out wildlife and threatening humans. Our Stolen Future may cause greater alarm. The first print run of 25,000 copies in the United States this year sold out. 

<P>The book is a synthesis of research findings. Dr Theo Colborn, the book's lead author, who works for a private environmental foundation in Washington DC, said she had read about 10,000 papers and reports in the past eight years. 

<P>It may soon be possible to conclude, if not prove, based on the weight of the evidence, that hormone-disrupting chemicals are linked to testicular cancer, falling sperm counts and learning disabilities and attention deficits in children," says the book. 

<P>Scientists have discovered 51 types of synthetic chemical which interfere with the natural workings of hormones in animals or people. Some of these are already banned or restricted because they are known to be toxic to humans and wildlife - or to be carcinogenic. 

<P>These include PCBs, once manufactured in huge quantities for electrical transformers and capacitors, DDT, and dioxins produced when chlorine-containing compounds are burnt at low temperature. 

<P>Although the manufacture of PCBs was banned in most developed countries more than 10 years ago, it is still widespread - and found at levels of one part per million in the breast fat of women all over the world. 


<P>Consequently, says the book, a breast-feeding baby gets "five times the allowable daily level of PCBs set by international health standards for a 150 pound adult". 

<P>New hormone disruptors are also coming to light. A substance called nonylphenol mimics the female sex hormone oestrogen at very low concentrations. It is used in plastics and is also a breakdown product of industrial detergents, pesticides and personal care products. Another oestrogen mimic bisphenol A, has been found leaching from the plastic lining of food cans. 

<P>"I think the problems are going to get worse if we wait for governments and policymakers to act," Dr Colborn said. "We have to go back to the drawing board on how we produce and manage these chemicals."

<P>3 New Books-Environmental literary trilogy - the new silent spring?

<P>It is rare that a passionate social justice advocate, a dispassionate scientist, and a 
conservative policymaker see any aspect of the world in the same fundamental way. 
That Colborn, Durnil and Gibbs agree on so much when it comes to chlorine and 
dioxin makes this trilogy of books fascinating from several perspectives.

<P>Concern about toxic pollution in the environment began with Rachel Carson. Her 1962 
book Silent Spring warned that chlorinated pesticides and other man-made poisons 
could pollute the tissues of virtually all living things on earth: fish, birds, mammals and 
people. Carson's central message - the need to stop production and use of a broad 
range of industrial chemicals - was defamed and ignored. Today her foresight seems 
obvious.

<P>Three recently published books in the USA - by an environmental scientist, a 
housewife turned activist from Love Canal, and an arch-conservative Republican party 
leader - form a trilogy in environmental literature that surpasses even Silent Spring in 
their implications for our future. They should not be missed.

<P>Dr Theo Colborn is one of the nation's leading experts on the health effects of 
chemicals which assault the hormonal systems of humans and wildlife. Like Rachel 
Carson before her, Colborn has shaken the foundations of conventional science with 
her astute observations of the natural world, and her interdisciplinary approach to 
biology and toxicology. Her new book, Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our 
Fertility, Intelligence and Survival ?, lives up to its billing as a scientific detective 
story that makes environmental science accessible to ordinary readers. 

<P>With co-authors Dr. John Peterson Myers and journalist Diane Dumanoski, Colborn 
writes engagingly about how she unravelled the 40-year mystery of alarming sexual 
abnormalities and devastating reproductive failures in wildlife - from alligators in 
Florida swamps, to bald eagles in the Great Lakes - and now, growing evidence of 
related problems developing in humans.

<P>She traced the cause to chemicals that are called 'hormone disrupters' because they 
fool the body's delicate hormone system. This system conveys the chemical messages 
that govern human development. The 'hormone disrupters' scramble the messages: 
'Muggers on the body's information superhighway...,' Colborn calls them.

<P>Many hormone disrupters are inextricably linked to industrial uses of chlorine. They 
are found in chlorinated pesticides such as DDT, and in the dioxin coming out of 
incinerator smokestacks, or production of plastics such as the ubiquitous PVC 
(polyvinylchloride). Additional hormone disrupters are commonly added to PVC and 
leach out during use. Scientists believe hormone disrupters are linked to the 50% drop 
in male sperm counts over the last 50 years, and the soaring rates of breast, prostate 
and testicular cancer. 

<P>As any adult knows, hormones rule our sexual and reproductive functions from 
adolescence through menopause. Less known is the fact that hormones also control 
many other sensitive bodily functions. Hormonal disruption, especially during foetal or 
early infant development, can impair fertility, learning ability, create behaviour 
disorders, weaken the immune system's ability to provide protection from infectious 
disease as well as cause some types of cancer. The implications of this information are 
staggering, in that threats to fertility and development could endanger the survival of 
whole species, including humans. 


<P>CHLORINE ON THE GREAT LAKES

Gordon Durnil is a leading figure in the Indiana Republican Party, friend of former 
Vice President Dan Quayle, and George Bush's appointee to the International Joint 
Commission (IJC) - an influential advisory body with jurisdiction over the Great Lakes.

<P>In that capacity, he was convinced by Colborn's research that chlorine was the 
common precursor for many of the worst poisons contaminating the Great Lakes. As 
Chairman of the IJC, he recommended an orderly transition process to sunset the use 
of chlorine in major industrial uses on the Great Lakes.

<P>Durnil's firsthand account of his conversion to environmentalism during the anti-
regulatory craze of the Bush/Quayle Administration is called The Making of a 
Conservative Environmentalist. The book is compelling both for its personal honesty 
and its factual integrity.

<P>A lifelong, pro-business Republican, Durnil candidly exposes the strategy of the 
chemical industry to undermine any meaningful effort to address the crisis in the Great 
Lakes. He draws from his deeply rooted social and economic conservatism to support 
his call for a swift response to the threat posed to children by chlorine based 
compounds such as dioxin. As he concludes, toward the end of his book: 'And one last 
word for my conservative colleagues: We should be leading this parade!'.

<P>Dying From Dioxin reaches the same conclusion from a different starting point. 
Author Lois Marie Gibbs lived and raised a family in dioxin-contaminated Love Canal. 
Her first-hand experience of injury to her family's and community's health, and the 
failure of government and industry to respond to this public health crisis, compelled 
her to take up the fight her self. Her campaign to clean up Love Canal first brought the 
world's attention to the threat posed by industrial waste dumps. 

<P>She is unabashedly anti-corporate, but Gibbs nevertheless shares Durnil's passion to 
protect future generations from the threat posed by dioxin, an inevitable waste product 
of industrial chlorine use. Her new book methodically catalogues the extent of the 
known threats from dioxin: 

<P> there is no safe exposure level; 

<P>humans currently carry dioxin in their bodies at levels that have been proven to 
cause serious health impacts in animals; 

<P> this dioxin bioaccumulates in the fat, and 90% of human exposure occurs through 
our diet (e.g. meats, dairy products, and fish); 

<P> dioxin is linked to cancer and hormone disruption; 

<P> children get the biggest exposures of dioxin while in the uterus, while nursing and 
through diet in early childhood (when body weight is low, yet dietary exposure is 
comparable to adult's). 

<P>Gibbs' call for citizen action echoes Durnil's official IJC mandate: halt incineration (a 
major dioxin source), and phase out industrial production and use of chlorine and PVC 
(the leading industrial use of chlorine today). 

<P>It is rare that a passionate social justice advocate, a dispassionate scientist, and a 
conservative policymaker see any aspect of the world in fundamentally the same way. 
That Colborn, Durnil and Gibbs agree on so much when it comes to chlorine and 
dioxin, makes this trilogy of books fascinating from several perspectives. 

<P>Amidst the urgency of their message, they offer some hope for optimism. There is 
emerging agreement about the nature of the problem and direction of future solutions 
rooted in industrial transition. There would seem to be no further excuse to delay the 
transition to a chlorine-free society.

<P><B>Mother's milk may not be best</B>

<P>Scientists disagree about the dangers to babies of dioxins that accumulate in women's bodies, writes Jackie Kemp


<P>Choose your poison: that's the unpleasant choice facing mothers feeding babies. Breast has long been seen as best but scientists are falling out over claims that toxic waste builds up in women's bodies and comes out in their milk.

<P>Dioxins, produced mainly through burning plastic waste, are toxic chemicals which get into the food chain. Over time they accumulate at the top of the chain, in humans. The only mechanism which discharges them - breast feeding - passes them straight into babies. 

<P>A first born baby can get as much as 14% of the lifetime safe dose of dioxins in a year of being breast-fed.

<P>Scandinavian scientists claim new research shows that one in ten women have such a high level that they should breast feed for only a few weeks at most. At a conference next month they will try to put pressure on the World Health Organisation to find a cheap test to establish dioxin levels in women.

<P>But in Britain this week The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food will publish research carried out by the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow showing dioxin levels in breast milk have apparently fallen by a third in the last five years. The complicated tests, costing £2,000 each, were carried out on 20 volunteers in Glasgow and 20 in Birmingham as part of a WHO screening programme.

<P>However, although the levels were lower than in previous tests, they still showed babies getting  a level more than 10 times the safe daily dose for adults in Britain. The US, Holland and Germany have now lowered the estimated safety levels to one tenth of the figure used in Britain.

<P>Many experts regard as complacent the view that breast feeding should be encouraged. One of the worlds leading authorities is the Dutch scientists Janna Koppe. She says her work has shown that dioxins in the mother subtly affect a baby's thyroid gland and liver function. It can even make babies less responsive to stimuli. They have diminished potential, she says.

<P>You cannot say who has a high level of dioxins and who does not, says Koppe. There are some statistical indicators. If a woman is in her 30s or older, they will be higher because they accumulate over time.  If she eats a lot of animal fat, particularly fish and dairy products, they will be higher because those are the main source, and if she has never breast fed a baby before they will be high.

<P>At the conference Koppe will call on the World Health Organisation to take the issue more seriously. The WHO is trying to get people to breast feed. They think the information about dioxins will dilute the message. They fear it will be misinterpreted by women, particularly in the Third World. But if women find out in ten years time that they breast fed when perhaps they should not have, they will be very angry.

<P>Koppe says for the vast majority of women the advantage of breast feeding for their own health  and for the baby's health, outweigh the risks. 

<P>What we want to see is a test available for all women so they can have the information about their dioxin level. I would say if a woman's level is rather high she should consider breast feeding for a few weeks only. Women must make up their own minds, but we want them to have all the information they need to do that.

<P>Koppe says women who are worried should avoid animal fat and drink low fat or organic milk in an attempt to help.

<P>The Women's Environmental Network in the UK supports the governments stance. We say women should keep breast feeding, says spokeswoman Ann Link.

<P>I have seen womanise breasts described by some of these scientists as toxic waste dumps. I think that in the language scientists are using there is an element of undermining women and attacking their bodies and what they can do. Breast feeding is best for the mother and best for the baby.

<P>Link and her colleagues call for a huge effort by society to reduce dioxin levels. We believe that dioxins do most damage to babies in the womb. They cause subtle effects on the development of the thyroid gland and the brain - it may be that disorders like hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder are more common now as a result of dioxin damage.

<P>But the added effect of breast feeding is very slight and does nothing to outweigh the advantages to the baby's immune system and the other advantages of it.

<P>She points out that bottle feeding itself produces more dioxin as a by-product of disposing of the plastic.

<P>Environmentalists are attacking the UK government for not phasing out chemicals that mimic the female hormones, oestrogens.  A report from the Medical Research Council (MRC) (1) says that such chemicals might be linked to testicular cancer and falling sperm counts.  The government wants further research before it acts.

<P>‘If there ever was a case for applying the precautionary principle (that is, it's better to be safe than sorry), then this must surely be it,’ fulminate Friends of the Earth (FoE), Greenpeace, the Pesticides Trust, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the Women's Environmental Network and the International Society for Stereology, in a letter to The Times.  They argue that phase-outs are worth inconveniencing some companies if they safeguard the health of many people. 

<P>The report by the MRC's Institute for Environment and Health found that deteriorate reproductive health in humans and wildlife might be connected with the many chemicals that either mimic oestrogens or block the actions of the male hormones.  But it stresses that no-one has proved a direct link.  ‘Proof of a cause-effect relationship is likely to remain elusive,’ it adds. 

<P>The report calls for urgent research to establish human exposure levels; to develop tests to identify oestrogen-mimics; and to investigate testicular cancer and sperm quality. 

<P>The range of suspected chemicals is large.  Natural and synthetic oestrogens, such as those used in oral contraceptives and for veterinary use, are obvious candidates.  Many vegetables also contain oestrogen-like compounds. 

<P>Other culprits are industrial chemicals and byproducts whose oestrogen-like properties have mostly been uncovered since 1990.  These include organochlorine pesticides such as DDT and dieldrin; polychlorinated biphenyls; alkylphenol polyethoxylates, which are non-ionic surfactants; and di(2-ethyhexyl)phthalate, a plasticiser for PVC.  Dioxins may cause problems by inhibiting oestrogens, rather than mimicking them. 

<P>Many researchers have found that sperm count and quality have been falling since the 1940s, says the report,  but it points out that this doesn't necessarily mean that fertility is also on the wane. Other male reproductive disorders - from birth and developmental defects to testicular cancer - are increasing in the UK, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, Australasia and the US. 

<P>Wildlife is also affected. For example, recent research found that effluent from sewage works made male rainbow trout in English and Welsh rivers produce a protein normally only excreted by female fish who are laying eggs.  Other research highlights sex-changes in alligators and whelks. 

<P>The government claims that the report ‘provides no justification for any immediate action on any particular chemicals.’  But it adds that this might change ‘if and when further scientific evidence is available.’  Controls already exist to limit releases of harmful chemicals into the environment, it says. 

<P>The UK Chemical Industries Association agrees.  ‘We need to develop a fuller understanding of exactly what the problem is and its causes,’ says policy director David Culpin.  The industry is funding research and ‘will take a appropriate action if its products are found to be at fault.’ 

<P>But this is not good enough for environmentalists.  WWF consultant Gwynne Lyons says that regulations only apply to specifically ‘prescribed’ substances; many of the compounds in the report aren't prescribed. 

<P>Meanwhile, FoE's pollution campaigner Roger Lilley points out that the government's sustainable development strategy says action can be taken on dangerous pollutants ‘even where scientific knowledge is not conclusive.’  The ability of our species to reproduce might be under threat, he says.

<P><H3>New Statesman and Society, 7 July 1995 pp 29-30
</H3>

<P><H3>Are men on the way out?</H3>

<P>Sex maybe necessary for genetic fitness, but that does not necessarily mean lots of 
able-bodied males, says Ruth Grant. Some animals do without them altogether, 
others reduce them to dependent dwarfs. Now pollutants maybe threatening those that 
are left. 


<P>It's a very little thing, maleness.  Genetically, vertebrate males, including men, hang on 
by the skin of their teeth (or by the appropriate analogy for the dentitionally challenged 
elements of the animal world). Just one gene, 240 DNA bases long in a genome that 
contains billions of bases, differentiates the male of the species from (in computer 
jargon) the default mode, the female. As Steve Jones, author of the Language of 
Genes, has pointed out, the same gene is found in all male mammals and is similar to 
the gene that passes for masculinity in yeast. It has even been suggested that maleness 
is essentially parasitic, that those 240 bases managed to insert themselves in some 
long-ago bacterial coupling and have remained there ever since, as difficult to get rid 
of as a herpes virus and about as much use. 

<P>As it is with the genotype, so it is with the phenotype, the physical expression of those 
genes. The very precariousness of maleness has been emphasised by the suspicion that 
a number of chemical pollutants can mimic the effects of sex hormones, with dire 
consequences for some male animals, including humans. 

<P>Why sex, and therefore males, exists at all is something of a mystery. After all, 
parthenogenesis, where females simply give birth to daughters, would seem a more 
efficient mode of reproduction - no need to find a mate and all the mother's genes are 
passed on instead of half. For plants and insects there are lots of examples. The best 
known would be dandelions and aphids. However, sex and the genetic diversity it 
brings, whether you like it or not, does appear to be necessary to higher vertebrates. 
Among lower vertebrates, a few frogs, lizards and fishes are parthenogenetic but 
among birds and mammals, apart from a few highly inbred domestic fowl, none is 
known. 

<P>Yet, while males may be necessary for higher animals, why are there so many of them 
and why are they so big? After all, one male can normally inseminate large numbers of 
females and, since most males contribute only fleetingly to fertilisation and little or 
nothing to raising the young, why should the male of a species be much more than a 
rare, short-lived carrier of sperm? The first is easy to answer. There are sound 
mathematical reasons why the ratio of the sexes should be equal, which any biology 
textbook should be able to explain. Only in exceptional circumstances does that ratio 
change. 

<P>The other is more problematic. The idea that males are bigger than females is a rather 
mammal-centred one. It is notoriously untrue for, say, spiders and praying mantises, 
where the male often provides the female with dessert after his one and only effort at 
copulation. For most of the animal world, larger females are the norm. Even among 
mammals, while males are generally larger, there are plenty of exceptions, such as 
rabbits and hares, and some bats, seals and antelopes. The biggest animal that ever 
lived was almost certainly a female, since blue whale females are larger than males. 

<P>Those who enjoy putting the male in his place might appreciate the example of certain 
ceratioid angler fishes. These live in the deep ocean, in total darkness, at depths of 
3,000-10,000 feet. They have large, gaping, teeth-filled mouths and lure their prey by 
flashing luminescent light glands. In I922, one of these fishes, a female 26 inches long, 
was found to have a smaller, two-inch long individual, attached to its skin. At first, this 
was assumed to be a juvenile, but a few years later it was realised that it was actually a 
male fish. Furthermore, their vascular (blood) systems were fused. The young one 
was in reality a fully adult, sexually mature dwarf male. Its mouth parts were fused 
with the female's skin and it no longer fed for itself. Several species of these fish 
employ the same technique; in some it is almost impossible to decide where one fish 
begins and the other ends . The reason seems to be that, in these sparsely populated, 
utterly dark waters, the female would find it difficult to meet an unattached male when 
she needed one. Better to have him reduced to the absolute minimum and carry him 
around with you. 

<P>Not that this represents the limit of this particular strategy. One species of the parasite 
Enteroxenos, which lives inside the gut of sea cucumbers, was thought to be 
hermaphrodite since it appeared to have both male and female parts. Then, in I972, it 
was discovered that the “male organ” was actually all that was left of a dwarf male that 
had invaded the female’s body and then lost virtually all its organs except, of course, 
its testes. 

<P>So why is this eminently reasonable strategy - sexual reproduction without the need for 
a load of loafing males constantly demanding attention, eating food and generally 
making a nuisance of themselves - not adopted by most of the animal kingdom? The 
answer seems to be that, since males are necessary, they become actors in the 
evolutionary game, with individual priorities that may not be those of the species, let 
alone those of the female. The greatest number of viable offspring is the ultimate goal, 
for male as well as female. If, for example, it makes sense to be aggressive and fight 
with other males for access to a harem, then body size and strength will matter. (For an 
interesting and amusing discussion of some of these points see Stephen Jay Gould's 
Hen 's Teeth and Horse’s Toes.) 

<P>Bigger and stronger the human male may be, but definitely not tougher. Life 
expectancy for women is 5-10 per cent greater than for men and almost twice as many 
women as men reach the age of 85. The reasons are complex. It seems to be that, 
across a whole range of indicators, the female body is tougher and more resilient than 
the male. A key factor in the expression of gender in the animal body is the balance of 
the sex hormones, primarily oestrogen in the female and testosterone in the male and it 
is beginning to look as if males, including men, are rather more sensitive to external 
hormonal influences than are females . 

<P>For men, this can be seen in a lowering of sperm counts and an increase in testicular 
cancer. Sperm counts in some industrialised countries have halved over the past 20 
years and testicular cancers have increased dramatically, according to Richard Sharpe 
of the Medical Research Council Reproductive Biology Unit, writing in the journal 
Nature last month. In Denmark, the lifetime risk of developing testicular cancer is now 
nearly 1 per cent and the rise has so alarmed the Danish government that it has 
commissioned a report to be published this autumn. Nor is this the only effect. There is 
other, though more equivocal, evidence of an increase in abnormal development of the 
penis (hypospadias) and failure of descent of the testes (cryptorchidism). The cause is 
thought to be the accumulation of industrial pollutants that mimic the effects of 
oestrogen and cause abnormalities in the development of male embryos which manifest 
themselves later in life. The effects are by no means confined to humans, but have been 
seen in animals from alligators to sea birds . 

<P>Naturally, no pollution threat goes unchallenged these days, and Greenpeace produced 
an ad, coyly entitled You're not half the man your father was, accompanied by an 
equally coy picture of a (very small) cherubic willy (see Green Gauge, 23 June). The 
implication was that oestrogen-like chemicals were a threat to the amour propre of the 
present generation of men. Perhaps. Greenpeace did not get where it is by the subtlety 
of its approach and the ad definitely overstated the case, but there is a case 
nevertheless. As Sharpe points out, the list of potential problem chemicals is large. 
More than 30 have been identified so far, ranging from insecticides to combustion 
products and plasticisers used in the making of clingfilm. These compounds are near-
ubiquitous in the environment, albeit at very low levels, but no one knows whether 
they can act cumulatively, so that while individually none may be above the danger 
level, in total they could be. 

<P>And in addition to the oestrogen mimics, there are the anti-androgens, chemicals that 
bind to testosterone and prevent its action. Last month, it was announced that the main 
breakdown compound from DDT in the body (called p,p'-DDE) is a potent anti-
androgen. It has taken nearly 5O years since its first use to discover the anti-androgen 
effects of DDT and, while its use has been restricted or banned for more than 20 years 
in most developed countries, it was used in enormous quantities before then and it is 
still in very wide use in the third world. As Sharpe points out: We can only guess at 
the levels of exposure to DDT this led to in the general population. Male alligators in 
Florida exposed to high levels of p,p'-DDE have abnormally small penises as well as a 
range of other genital abnormalities. 

<P>So what to do? The crux of the problem is the absence of hard data. Neither the 
amounts and numbers of these chemicals in the environment, nor their effects. nor even 
the factor by which male reproductive disorders have increased, are known with any 
degree of precision. The first priority is thus collection of information. As that 
information is gathered, the net will inevitably widen. In particular, we will have to 
address a question that so far appears to have gone completely unasked. Hormones are 
quintessentially behaviour affecting compounds. What effect, therefore if any, does the 
build up of oestrogen-like and anti-androgen compounds in the environment have on 
the behaviour of the human male? It would be interesting to know.

<!--INSERT TEXT HERE>

<H3> Background on Genetically Engineered Maize.</H3> Greenpeace, December 1996

<p>Ciba Geigy applied in 1994 to the French authorities to have its genetically engineered corn approved for marketing in the European Union. Ciba Geigy's genetically engineered (GE) corn has been manipulated to be herbicide tolerant to the herbicide Basta, and a synthetic version of a gene from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has been inserted to add insect resistence. In addition, a marker gene has been inserted, which confers resistance to the antibiotic Ampicillin. 

<p>After acceptance by the French authorities, the application was forwarded to the European Commission in March 1995, and the Commission in turn circulated it to all Member States in April 1995 for com ments. On the basis of the comments submitted by Member States, the Commission circulated in March 1996 a proposal to accept Ciba Geigy's application.

<p>The proposal did not muster the required qualified majority. On 25 April, the press reported that four countries had voted "no" to the GE corn (Denmark, Austria, Sweden, and the UK), while another four countries had abstained (Germany, Luxembourg, Italy and Greece). This information has subsequently been confirmed by the Commission.

<p>The non-approval of the Commission's proposal was the result of the normal written voting procedure in the Article 21 committee through which the EU member states advice the EU Commission on the implementation of the EU directive 90/220 on deliberate releases of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The members of the Article 21 committee are officials of national administrations in charge of implementing Directive 90/220. 

<p>Denmark, Sweden and Austria all objected to the marketing application because the Commission's proposal did not provide for labelling of the Ciba Geigy corn as "genetically modified". One of them also objected because of the herbicide tolerance and another because of the insect resistance. For the UK, inadequate assessment of the impacts of antibiotic resistance and herbicide tolerance were among the key factors causing it to turn its thumb down to this application.

<p>The non-approval of the Ciba Geigy's genetically engineered corn by the Article 21 Committee means that the matter must now be dealt with by the Council of Environment Ministers. 


<H4>RE: INADEQUATE AND FLAWED RISK ASSESSMENT.</H4>

<H5>The Requirements For Risk Assessment</H5>

 Directive 90/220, Article 11, stipulates that any application for marketing of a genetically modified organism must be accompanied by a risk 
assessment specified in Annex II of the Directive. 

<p>According to Annex II B, section D, the applicant must assess:

<p>- "any toxic or harmful effects on human health and the environment" (point 7), and 

<p>- "potentially significant interactions with non-target organisms" (point 9). 

<p>According to section H, the applicant must further assess:

<p>- the likelihood of the genetically engineered plant "becoming more persistent than the recipient or parental plants in agricultural habitat
or more invasive in natural habitats (point 1), and 

<p>- "possible environmental impact resulting from potential interactions with non-target organisms" (point 4). 

<H4>RE. ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE.</H4> Ciba Geigy's genetically engineered corn contains a socalled marker gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic Ampicillin, - an antibiotic commonly used in human and animal therapy against a wide spectrum of pathogenic organisms.

<p>The risk of the transfer of this antibiotic resistance gene to micro-organisms, including pathogenic micro-organisms in the human digestive tract, cannot be ruled out. 

<p>Greenpeace raised this concern about the transfer of the Ampicillin resistance gene in a submission regarding Corson Grain's field testing application on behalf of Ciba Geigy to the New Zealand GMO Interim Assessment Group (IAG) in October 1995. 

<p>Ciba Geigy's response to this concern was that a fairly high degree of resistance to Ampicillin already exists among human and animal pathogenic organisms, thus arrogantly implying that whatever benefits from Ampicillin may still remain, Ciba Geigy is free to undermine in pursuit of its own economic interests. 

<p>The danger of transfer of antibiotic resistance to bacteria in the human intestines has caused the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) of the UK Government to evaluate 
the matter in a "Report on the Use of Antibiotic Resistance Markers in Genetically Modified Food Organisms (July 1994). 

<p>In the report (p.vii), the ACNFP recommends that where antibiotic resistance marker genes are used in foods from genetically modified plants, safety evaluation should include assessments of:

- the clinical use of the antibiotic,<br>
- the likelihood of transfer of the antibiotic resistance gene into, and expression in, gut micro-organisms; and<br>
- toxicity of the gene product.<br>

<p>More generally, the ACNFP recommends that "researchers developing food GMOs should be encouraged to develop and use alternatives to antibiotic resistance markers and/or methods to jettison those used ".

<H4>RE. ALLERGIES.</H4> The risk of genetically engineered corn having such human health effects cannot be ruled out. Ciba Geigy's corn contains genetic material from different bacteria, and a
synthetic gene encoding for a Bt toxin. The bacteria as well as the synthetic gene product has never before formed part of the human diet. 

<p>Proof already exists that allergens can be transferred into plants through genetic engineering. The American seed company Pioneer Hi-Bred attempted to increase the nutritional value of soybeans by in
serting a gene from a Brazil nut. Although animal studies had found that the protein of this gene was not a major allergen, subsequent studies discovered that Pioneer Hi-Bred's genetically altered soya bean could cause allergic reactions in humans sensitive to Brazil nuts. This was reported by Nordlee et al. in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 14, 1996 (p. 688-692).

<p>This was, however, a lucky case. The discovery of the allergenic potential of Pioneer's genetically engineered soybean before it was used as human food was thanks to the fact that Brazil nuts are a known food allergen, and hence serum samples of persons known to be allergic to Brazil nuts were available for testing.

<p>In most other cases of genetically engineered plants, the genes come from bacteria which have never been part of human diet. In these cases, no information exists about their allergenic properties and, consequently, no serum samples for testing are available. This is the case with Ciba Geigy's transgenic corn.

<p>As mentioned in the letter to the EU environment ministers, the allergenic potential of such exotic, introduced gene products are, according to another article in the new England Journal of Medicine (p. 726-728) by Marion Nestle, uncertain, unpredictable and untestable.

<p>Ciba-Geigy disregards the danger of allergenicity and chronic toxicity. This means that the consumers in Europe have effectively been reduced to guinea-pigs, who will have to test whether the 
transgenic corn causes food allergies in the short and long-term. This clearly is contrary to both the word and spirit of Directive 90/220.

<H4>RE. INSECT-RESISTANCE.</H4> 

With regard to this trait, assessment of the environmental impact on non-target organisms in European eco-systems is called for in relation to the above-mentioned requirements of Directive 90/220. These are clearly not fulfilled by the application by Ciba Geigy. 

<p>The Bt toxin, when produced by the Bt soil bacteria in its natural form, is present only when spores are formed. The toxin is present in an inactive form and only activated in the gut of the insect after partial enzymatic digestion. In Ciba Geigy's GE corn, the Bt toxin will be produced non-stop, which makes this Bt toxin far more potent both against target and non-target insects. 

<p>With regard to the impact on non-target organisms, only two field projects have studied the interactions of Bt insect resistant plants with non-target insects. One study was conducted in Italy and the other in the US. Both tests were part of Ciba Geigy's application to the EU.

<p>However, no experimental details were given for the tests in Italy, and with regard to the US tests, the impacts of the transgenic corn on lepidopterans insects (e.g. butterflies and moths) were not 
assessed. In addition, the results presented are not necessarily representative for impacts on European eco-systems. 

<p>Greenpeace asked Dr. John Barrett of Cambridge University, a geneticist, who has acted as an advisor to the OECD on genetic engineering, to review Ciba Geigy's study on the impacts of the transgenic corn pollen on lady beetle larval development, - a study, which was submitted as a part of their application to the EU. Dr. Barrett found that the experimental design was constructed in such a manner that it was unlikely to detect a statistically significant difference in the survival rate of the larval receiving transgenic pollen compared to those receiving normal pollen. 

<p>Given this combination of inadequate, inaccurate and geographically irrelevant studies, the Directive's requirement of assessment of impact on non-target organisms cannot possibly be said to be fulfilled. 

<H4>RE. HERBICIDE TOLERANCE.</H4> This trait calls for assessment of impact on non-target organisms and with the combination of herbicide tolerance and insect-resistance, the corn's potential weediness and invasiveness should also be carefully assessed. With regard to the invasive potential, Ciba-Geigy states in their application:  "In Europe, maize unintentionally released into the environment is hardly able to grow because of the competition with other plants and is most of the time sterile. The establishment of a spontaneous maize population is therefore highly unlikely and has never been reported. The genetically modified maize behaves in the same way." Ciba-Geigy's assertion that the transgenic corn behaves in the same manner as normal corn is unfounded.

<p>Although normal corn has so far shown no weedy characteristics, there is no guarantee that this is also true for genetically engineered corn. Genetically engineered traits such as enhanced resistance
to insects and diseases in combination with herbicide tolerance may well confer survival advantages. Such an advantage may allow the plant to invade surrounding ecosystems.

<p>Ciba-Geigy's statement ignores scientific warnings.  Kareiva and Parker of the University of Washington conclude in an independent report prepared for Greenpeace International in 1994 (p. 2) that: "Blanket assurances of safety for all GEOs are not scientifically sound ... it is erroneous to draw a conclusion of safety because crops in the past have generally not produced ecological disasters, or because nothing unfortunate has happened as a result of our thousands of GEO field trials to date.  Past experiences simply do not apply to some of the new trait-crop combinations produced through genetic engineering."

<p>In circumstances where irreversible harm may occur, safety should not be based on assumptions and poorly educated guesses. This is contrary to the precautionary principle to which the EU is committed in the Maastricht Treaty.


<H4>RE. UNDEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES.</H4>

<p>Article 21 of Directive 90/220 stipulates that if a Commission proposal such as the approval of Ciba Geigy's corn is not adopted by the committee of Member State officials, then: 

<p>"... the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority." "If, on the expiry of a period of three months from the date of referral to the Council, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Comission."

<p>These provisions of Directive 90/220 may entail three scenarios, which - taken together - leave all the cards in the hands of the Commission and the one country, which originally accepted the applica
tion. The scenarios are:

<p>Scenario 1: if the Commission submits an un-amended proposal for approval of Ciba-Geigy's GE corn, and if a qualified majority of Member States in favor of this proposal still cannot be found, then, 
according to EU law, "the Council has not acted", which - according to the last paragraph quoted above - means that the Commission can itself approve the GE corn after "a period of three months".

<p>In other words, the Commission and France can - by leaning back and doing nothing - approve Ciba Geigy's corn against the will of what could even be a clear majority of the Member States.

<p>Scenario 2: if an amended proposal is submitted by the Commission or with the concurrence of the Commission, it can be adopted by qualified majority. Again, the Commission is in a key-position elevated above the Member States.

<p>Scenario 3: if an amended proposal is submitted without the concurrence or against the will of the Commission, unanimity is required for its adoption. Given the fact that one Member State, in this case France, already has approved the original application, this is as good as a non-option. This brings us back to the mechanism described in scenario 1. By being unable to muster the required unanimity, "the Council has not acted", and consequently the Commission can implement its original proposal.

<p>Legally, this leaves the Member States virtually powerless if they are opposed to a proposal from the Commission, - an unbelievable situation in a Union of democratic states. It is a Catch 22 situation, where either Member States approve a Commission proposal, or the Commission can implement its proposal even if it is against the will of a majority of the Member States.

<p>The only legal option left for the Member States is a cumbersome one of bringing the Commission before the European Court of Justice for violating Directive 90/220. This ultimate legal threat, of course, also gives the Council of Ministers considerable political weight to urge the Commission to withdraw its proposal to approve an application, which so clearly does not meet the requirements of Directive 90/220.

<p>It goes without saying that Member States ought to review and change these decision-making rules at the Intergovernmental Conference on the Review of the Maastricht Treaty on the European Union.  

<p>Finally, it should be recalled that according to Article 4, paragraph 1 of Directive 90/220, "member States shall ensure that all apropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the deliberate release or placing on the market of GMOs."

<!--INSERT TEXT HERE> Greenpeace Briefing Oct. 1996
<H2>By Christmas, 60% of your food could be genetically manipulated</H2>

<B><I>Genetic manipulation is a vast experiment with unknown risks.  We are all about to become a part of  this global experiment, the results of which are unpredictable and irreversible. But it can be stopped.</I></B>

<P>US farmers are now harvesting the first crop of genetically manipulated soya beans.

<P>These soya beans have been genetically manipulated by chemical giant Monsanto, to be resistant to their own herbicide "Roundup". They contain genes from a bacteria, a virus and a petunia. Monsanto have called these beans "Roundup Ready".

<P>Although, this year, less than 2% of US soya beans planted will be Roundup Ready, the plan is to mix them with traditional soya beans and introduce them into many of the hundreds of products which contain soya bean ingredients.  

<P>About 60% of all processed food contains soya bean ingredients.  Everyday foods like bread, margarine, biscuits and cakes often contain soya, as do many baby foods, vegetarian and diet foods, chocolate and beer.

<P>If this goes ahead,  consumers will NOT have the right to choose whether or not they want to buy or eat genetically manipulated food.

<P>There is only one benefit from Roundup Ready Soya beans: they can survive exposure to the chemical herbicide Roundup  (glyphosate). Against this single benefit weigh the risks of genetic pollution and rising dependence on herbicides.

<P>Consumers do not want genetically manipulated material in their food. In a recent poll carried out in Germany, 80% of those questioned said they did not wish to eat genetically manipulated food. Despite the fact that Europe is one of the largest markets for US soya beans, retailers have been told that food ingredients made from natural soya will NOT BE AVAILABLE when this years harvest arrives in a few weeks time.


<H3>What's wrong with Genetic Manipulation?</H3>

<P>Genetic manipulation (also sometimes called genetic modification, genetic engineering or biotechnology), is still very much an experimental science. The results of this experiment are to a large extent unpredictable. 

<P>1) It is impossible to predict exactly what effect a new set of genes in a plant will have, and how they will make that plant behave. Genetically manipulated plants may cross-breed with wild relatives, leading to strains of wild plants taking on some of the characteristics of the genetically manipulated plant. Existing weeds could become more hardy, food crops could be turned into invasive weeds. The consequences of this sort of  'genetic pollution' could be a loss in plant biodiversity as genetically manipulated species drive more delicate plants from their habitat. 

<P>2) Reliance on a bean like the Roundup Ready Soya bean increases the dependency of farmers on a single chemical company and on chemicals in general. We have seen something similar to this before, with disastrous results for many farmers. Under the flag of the "green revolution" farmers in underdeveloped countries were tied into a dependence on chemical fertilisers and pesticides. The capital intensiveness of this new system drove smaller farmers out of business and reduced biodiversity. The introduction of a new technology had unintended social and environmental costs. 

<P>3) The pathway  for agriculture which involves genetic manipulation effectively rules out the chance for a sustainable agricultural system for the future. By encouraging farmers to use genetically manipulated crops often reliant on chemical herbicides, giant corporations such as Monsanto push the farming industry away from the possibility of a more sustainable agricultural system that uses integrated pest management and organic techniques, something which the public is increasingly interested in. 

<P>4) Changes in the protein structure of foods, through the introduction of new genetic material, may trigger off allergies and have other unpredictable health consequences in humans. 

<P>Field trials are currently inadequate. They do not take into account all the factors that may affect the genetically manipulated crop once it is grown commercially. Field trials are regulated in such a way as to minimise opportunity for seed escape, seed carryover in the soil and pollen escape. However, none of these can be controlled once the plants are grown as commercial crops.

<P>With large scale commercial releases of genetically manipulated organisms, extremely rare events WILL occur.   

<P><I>Impacts on the natural environment are irreversible. Once new genetic material is released it is self replicating and can never be contained.</I>

<P><H3>But won't genetic engineering help to feed the worlds hungry?</H3>

<P>The world hunger problem is not one of a simple shortage of food. The world already produces 50% more food than is necessary to feed everyone. The problem is one of poverty and access to food. Many poor people, especially in third world countries just cannot get access to food, no matter how much is produced.

<P>Genetic manipulation of food does not address this problem. Instead it compounds it by reinforcing the trend in which control of food production and marketing is taken away from small farmers and consolidated in the hands of agri-business. Companies that develop genetically manipulated crops use patents to gain monopoly control over them. Hence the 'Roundup Ready' Soya bean (RRS) has been patented by Monsanto and the seed is sold at a premium price that is out of reach of many small farmers. Patents on crops also mean that royalties may be charged if farmers want to keep some seed for their own use the following season, or if they want to exchange seed with neighbours. Seed saving and exchange is crucial to small farmers in the third world with little or no cash but companies involved in genetic manipulation want farmers to buy afresh each year.

<P>Likewise RRS ties soya bean farmers to a particular chemical herbicide and to a single company that makes that chemical. 


<H3>Great genetic failures of our time.</H3>

<P>There have already been a stream of failures which exemplify the unreliability, unpredictability and potential consequences of large scale releases of manipulated crops. For example: 

<P><B>Genetically manipulated cotton</B> was designed to resist attack from caterpillars by producing a toxin in its own leaves. American farmers planted 600,000 hectares of the new cotton strain. But it didn't work. Not enough toxin was produced. Thousands of hectares were lost despite the spraying of large quantities of herbicide to try to save the crop. The damage was estimated at 1 billion dollars. (Nature Biotechnology Vol.14, 1996).  

<P>Another Monsanto product is the genetically engineered "<B>recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone</B>" (rBGH). It is injected into cows to increase milk production. It has side effects on cows health, it's expensive to buy and the United States already produces a surplus of milk. It's use is currently banned in Europe because here too, a surplus of milk is produced. Monsanto have attempted to sue American companies who dared to label their products rBGH-free.
    
<P>The <B>genetically manipulated bacteria</B> "<I>Pseudomondas putida</I>" was intended to degrade the herbicide 2,4-D. It did just that, but unexpectedly broke it down into a substance that killed beneficial soil fungi. These fungi are crucial to soil fertility and protect plants against disease.

<P><B>Soil bacteria</B> "<I>Klebsiella</I>" were genetically manipulated to transform leftover parts of plants (like leaves) into ethanol that farmers could use as fuel. The engineered bacteria thrived in several soil types, but unexpectedly killed off grass (which died from alcohol poisoning) and caused a decrease in population of the beneficial soil fungi which help plants take up nutrients.   

<P>Previous attempts at a genetically engineered soybean included an inserted <B>Brazil nut gene</B>. It was only because Brazil nut is a known food allergen that the manipulated soya was tested for allergenic potential, found positive and withdrawn before it was used in human food.

<P>The giant Swiss corporation Ciba-Geigy is currently trying to get its genetically manipulated corn onto the European market. Approval has so far not been given as 13 EU Environment Ministers have expressed concern over the genetic modification. In the UK official bodies are concerned about the presence of an antibiotic resistant gene. It is feared that this gene could jump to the gut bacteria of animals that eat the corn and result in bacteria resistant to the antibiotic. 
  
<P>Greenpeace opposes agricultural and food uses of genetic manipulation as they involve deliberate releases of  genetically manipulated life forms into the wider environment.   The gains may be small and accrue to particular companies, the risks are unknown and are taken by the environment and society as a whole.<BR>

Dr. Michael Antoniou, Senior Lecturer in Molecular Biology, Letter to The Independent 29/9/96

<H3>Unique peril of engineered food crops</H3>

<P>Sir: I write in an effort to dispel the common myth that the use of genetic engineering to produce new varieties of crops and farm animals is a natural extension of cross-breeding methods (Suzanne Moore, 20 September;  J Stocker Letter 23 September). 

<P>In contrast to traditional methods, genetic engineering involves transfer of genetic material between totally unrelated organisms. Genes from viruses, bacteria, animals as well as unrelated plants have been engineered into crops. This circumvents natural species barriers and brings about combinations of genes that would never occur naturally. 

<P>This could be hailed simply as yet another great advance for modern agriculture if it wasn't that this is an imperfect technology with inherent dangers. The generation of genetically modified ("transgenic") plants  and animals not only involves the use of artificial genetic combinations ( such as parts of  plant viruses linked to bacterial genes), but also it's random splicing into the DNA of  the host organism. This gives rise to an unpredictable component with regard to the functioning of both the host and introduced gene unit. (Normal gene control is preserved during cross breeding of closely related species). 

<P>Furthermore, it is assumed that the protein product of the newly introduced gene will function in exactly the same way as it does in its native host, which frequently will not be the case. It is therefore not surprising to find that genetic engineering can result not only in reduced nutritional value, but also in the unexpected production of novel toxins and allergens. It is the unpredictability of these outcomes that is most worrying. This argues strongly for general toxicity testing perhaps something similar to that used for pharmaceuticals, and full labelling for all of these products. This will also allow the consumer to make and informed choice and truly "vote with supermarket trolley" (leading article, 20 September).

<P>Given that we have safe natural alternatives we should not be surprised to find the Prince of Wales and others questioning the use of this technology, since once out in the field genetic pollution cannot be cleaned up and will be passed on to all future generations.

<H3>The chicken and tomato problem</H3>

 By <B>Charles Arthur</B>

<H4>The food industry has grown so big that it has lost sight of what it exists to do: provide products that we all need to survive</H4>

<P>Imagine this. You walk into your local supermarket and in the bakery section find two loaves. One is blue; the other looks normal. A note below explains that there is no difference in the taste, recipe or dietary effect of the loaves, except that the blue one includes soya extract that was genetically engineered to be resistant to pesticides. It's the same price as the normal one. Would you buy it? 

<P>This hypothetical question is about to come true some time in the next couple of months, all over the supermarkets and food shops of Britain, and anywhere else in Europe that allows it except that the genetically engineered loaves won't be blue, nor will there be a label to tell you which Ioaf is which. It's conceivable - likely, in fact that every loaf in the store will have some geneticaty engineered contents. You simply won't know, and the stores won't be able to tell you. 

<P>It's not just the loaves, either: 60 per cent of the products in the supermarket - anything including soya or soya oils or extracts, including such staples as margarines, biscuits, cakes, sauces, noodles, pies, cooking oils, salad dressings and pizza bases, will also contain genetically engineered soya or its extracts. 

<P>Is that bad? Up to 85 per cent of European consumers think so: they say they would like to know if food has been genetically modified. Understandably. They would be eating something that their bodies had never encountered before, something that could not arise in nature. Environmentaists and scientists argue that the stretches of DNA which confer the herbicide resistance could interactwith bacteria in the gut to produce strange new hybnds - with unpredictable properties. 

<P>Is this worry well founded? Such jumps do happen; it's part of the mysteries of genetics. Nobody knows the full story of how genes truly operate and interact. The science journal <I>Nature</I> commented in an editorial last week that stlch a sequence of events has "a low probability. But the risk, nevertheless, is there, and a matter of genuine scientific debate." 

<P>We will have no chance to debate the matter. Scientists, shopping chains and consumers will have the changes imposed on them by a combination of commercial steam rolling and government and consumer apathy. The stores aren't actually very happy about this. All the major supermarkets pledged earlier this year that they would always label genetically engineered foods, so that customers would know what they were buying. When tomato pureé made from tomatoes genetically modified to stay fresh longer (by switching off an enzyme-producing gene) went on sale in February, it was proudly labelled. One supermarket proclaimed: "If Sainsbury's are to sell further products developed with the aid of genetic modification, these will be labelied." 

<P>Eight months later, they are beating the retreat. "We have been forced to accept that we won't be able to label [soya products] separately," said a spokeswoman for Sainsbury's recently. 

<P>The problem is, they don't have any way to prevent it. The soya is being grown on the other side of the Atlantic, and will this year make up about 2 per cent of the harvest. The powerful American Soybean Association has decided that it would be too expensive for its members to separate out the genetically engineered crop and so it is all going into the same hopper. It's a multi billion dollar industry, and the concerns of a few scientists not on their payroll, and of some environmental pressure groups, are not going to sway them. 

<P>It doesn't stop there. Ciba Geigy, the Swiss giant, has developed a form of maize that has been genetically altered to produce a chemical that poisons a troublesome mite called the corn borer, which normally chews out the stalks of the young crop. It is lobbying hard to have it accepted for wider use. 

<P>However, the maize has not been approved by the EU Council of Environmental Ministers. The UK's Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes was concerned by the addition to the maize of a gene that confers resistance to ampicillin, a widely used antibiotic. It argued that the gene could jump to the gut bacteria of animals that ate the unprocessed corn. The result would be bacteria resistant to ampicillin. 

<P>Europe may ban the US soya imports but that could trigger a small-scale trade war. So, at present, only Germany looks like it rnight take achon, by finding alternative sources of standard soya. 

<P>Monsanto and Ciba-Geigy have hit back by finding scientists prepared to say that there is "no scientific data" to indicate that DNA could jump from food to a microbe in an animal's gut. Fine - except that once they said the same about BSE. 

<P>The core of the problem is that the food industry has grown so big that it has lost sight of what it exists to do: provide products that we all need to survive. In fact, companies such as Monsanto and CibaGeigy have begun to act as though people are a peculiar irritant to their achievement of their aims of making money from selling biological products to farmers. 

<P>There's a significant distinction between a foodstuff bred to grow larger, or a different colour, and one that has been genetically ehgineered to do so by adding another species' gene. Gardeners and farmers have managed the former for centuries, without resorting to high-tech laboratories. 

<P>But the new debate goes beyond even that. Genetic technology offers our best hope for understanding so much about ourselves and the world we live in - and consume. But it has to learn to distinguish between a tomato that has had one of its normal genes switched off, and one that has had a foreign one added to make it - in one case a chicken gene was added to a tomato to enhance its growth properties. Such a thing is no longer a tomato - it's a chimera which might not ever arise in nature. I'd like to know that before I bite into it.

<!--INSERT TEXT HERE>What are the risks of releasing genetically manipulated organisms to the environment?

<H3>UNPREDICTABLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE</H3>  

The lessons of plants or animals being transferred to new locations, teach us that we are not able to predict how an organism will behave when introduced into a new environment. Often, for example when the Dutch Elm disease fungus was introduced into the UK in beetles in imported timber, the effects may be extremely damaging and widespread.

<P>The loss of elm trees in the British countryside has not only altered the landscape but because barn owls have lost nesting sites and chaffinches song posts, their numbers have declined. A species of butterfly has been almost lost and voles, having reduced predation from barn owls have been one of the few to benefit. It is unlikely that such a complex chain of events could have been predicted  even by computer modelling. Since they are living and have the capacity to reproduce, GMOs once released, will not be retrievable once environmental damage is recognised. Such damage may take decades to become evident.


<H3>EVOLUTION BYPASSED</H3>

<P>The "new" genes in the GMO may spread to its wild relatives, for instance via pollen in the case of plants, and alter their genetic makeup. The natural evolutionary process may be radically altered.

<H3>MORE CHEMICALS IN OUR COUNTRYSIDE</H3>

Many of the agricultural applications of genetic engineering are going to prolong our dependence on chemical inputs. Genetically engineered herbicide resistant crops have been produced. Their immunity to herbicide means that crops can be sprayed with these chemicals with impunity. The use of such crops will probably hasten the emergence of herbicide resistant weeds, which are already an increasing problem, and a new generation of herbicide resistant crop will have to be developed. Good for the agrochemical industry but not for the environment.

<H3>CHANGING THE COUNTRYSIDE</H3>

Under the multitude of different environmental conditions which exist, GMOs may behave very differently from the way they behave in the laboratory or in carefully controlled field trials. They may spread and displace native species and alter our countryside in irreversible ways. This will be possible for both plants and animals. Transgenic fish with a growth hormone gene inserted so they grow more rapidly are being developed. destined for fish farms they will almost inevitably escape and compete with natural populations, where their increased size and growth rate may lead to the displacement of indigenous species.

<P>So genetic engineering brings its own particular risks to the environment. The release of GMOs to the environment may have unpredictable effects and once released they will not be retrievable. Natural evolutionary processes will be bypassed and our countryside changed. Agricultural applications threaten to entrench our dependence on chemical inputs.

<P>But will genetic engineering solve our present environmental problems of pollution and global warming, and will they feed the world?

<H3>TECHNOLOGICAL FIXES - NOT SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS</H3>

Industry is designing bacteria to digest pollutants. This sounds wonderful but the pollutants will already have damaged the environment. Our efforts should be focused on pollution prevention rather than cleaning up afterwards.

<H3>AVOIDING THE ISSUES</H3>

Designing crops to grow in hotter climates and algae to consume carbon dioxide also sounds attractive, but distract us from taking active steps now to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.


<H3>NOT REACHING THE PEOPLE IN NEED</H3>

The new crops far from feeding the world are likely to continue to depend on chemical inputs, be expensive and not available to the poor farmers who really need help. In the same way the agricultural "Green Revolution" of the 1970s has failed to prevent starvation neither will genetic engineering. There are more fundamental issues to be addressed.

<P>So far from solving the problems we solve today, genetic engineering will not only bring new threats to the environment but will divert us from the fundamental problems by promising technological fixes which won't help those that need it most.

<!--INSERT TEXT HERE><H3>SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS ON THREATS POSED BY GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ORGANISMS (GEOS)</H3>

<B>A.  Genetic pollution through pollen or seed dispersal</B>

<P>* Gene transfer from crop radish to wild weedy relatives has been detected over distances of one kilometre (Klinger et al., 1992). Klinger and Ellstrand studied as well the fitness of weed-crop hybrids (crossbreeds) of radish. The crossbreeds showed significantly greater fruit and seed production, and in all other measured characters the hybrids were like weeds. Their results suggest that neutral or advantageous transgenes introduced into natural population will tend to persist in wild populations (Klinger & Ellstrand, 1994).

<P>* Field tests with genetically engineered potatoes have demonstrated both the high frequency and wide range of gene flow. When normal potato plants were planted in distances up to 1100 metres from genetically engineered potatoes, and the seeds of the normal potatoes were collected afterwards, 72% of the plants in the immediate neighbourhood of the transgenic potatoes contained the transgene.  At greater distances an almost constant 35% of seeds contained the transgene (Skogsmyr, 1994).

<P>* Scientists at the Scottish Crop Research Institute have shown that much more pollen escapes from large fields of genetically engineered oilseed rape than is predicted from earlier experiments on smaller plots. They found that escaping pollen fertilised plants up to 2.5 kilometres away (Timmons, 1994).

<P>* Joergensen and Andersen (1994) showed how easily oilseed rape crossbreeds with wild relatives and therefore how easily transfer of the herbicide resistance gene could occur. Within the first season they estimated that a substantial part of wild weed population could acquire the gene for herbicide tolerance. (Joergensen & Andersen, 1994, Mikkelsen,et al., 1996))

<P>*  Crop seeds travel hundreds of kilometres between seed merchant, farmer and processing factory, therefore spillage in transport is inevitable - and could be more worrying than threat through pollen spread (Crawley, 1996).


<P><B>B. The risk of transfer of foreign gene to micro-organism</B>

<P>It was reported in 1994 that gene transfer can occur from plants to micro-organisms.  Genetically engineered oilseed rape, black mustard, thorn-apple and sweet peas all containing an antibiotic-resistance gene were grown together with the fungus Aspergillus niger or their leaves were added to the soil.  The fungus was shown to have incorporated the antibiotic-resistance gene in all co-culture experiments (Hoffmann et al., 1994). It is worth noting that micro- organisms can transfer genes through several mechanisms to other unrelated micro-organisms.

<P>This risk caused UK Environment Department's Biotechnolgy Unit to advise the UK government to vote in the EU against the authorisation for placing onto the market of Ciba Geigy's transgenic corn in 1996: "the presence of an intact gene for resistance to beta-lac  tam antibiotics poses an unacceptable risk because consumption of the unprocessed product as animal feed could lead to the transfer of the gene to the gut microflora of animals." Ciba Geigy's genetically engineered corn contained among other foreign gene a gene for resistance against Ampicillin antibiotics (beta-lac tam antibiotics).


<P><B>C. Nasty surprises</B>

<P>* Genetically engineered soil bacteria Klebsiella: A common harmless variety of a bacteria Klebsiella planticola, inhabiting the root-zone of plants had been genetically engineered to transform plant residues like leaves into ethanol that farmers could readily use as a fuel. The genetically engineered bacteria not only survived and competed successfully with their parent strain in different soil types, it proved unexpectedly to inhibit growth or kill off grass in different soil types tested. In sandy soil, most of the grasses died from alcohol poisoning. In all soil types the population of beneficial mycorrhizal fungi in the soil decreased. These soil fungi are crucial for plant health and growth as they help plants to take up nutritions and to resist common diseases. In clay soils, the genetically engineered bacteria increased as well the number of root-feeding nematodes. (Holmes and Ingham, 1995)

<P>* Genetically engineered salmon: The transgenic salmon was engineered with an arctic flounder gene for increased cold tolerance. However, this transgenic salmon grows ten times as fast as normal salmon as the genetic modification resulted in an increased activity of the salmon's own growth hormone gene (MacKenzie, 1996).

<P>* The bacteria Pseudomonas putida was genetically engineered to degrade the herbicide 2,4-D.  The engineered bacteria broke down the herbicide but degraded it to a substance that was highly toxic to fungi.  These fungi - crucial to soil fertility and in protecting plants against diseases - were therefore destroyed (summarised in Doyle et al., 1995).

<P>* The toxin-producing gene of the bacteria Bacillus thurigiensis, for instance, is commonly engineered into crops to provide them with a built-in insecticide.  However, the toxin produced is known to resist degradation by binding itself to small soil particles whilst continuing its toxic activity.  The long term impact of this toxin on soil organisms and soil fertility is unknown (summarised in Doyle et al., 1995).


<P><B>D. Deadlier viruses</B>

<P>Genetically engineered virus resistant crops may cause the development of new kinds of plant viruses due to recombination events. Scientists published a study demonstrating that virus genes implanted into plant cells could be transferred into the genome of other viruses that the plants come into contact with (Greene and Allison, 1994). This could lead to the unintentional creation of new, and perhaps more virulent, plant viruses.


<P><B>E. Allergies</B>

<P>A new study showed that genetically engineered soybeans containing one  foreign Brazil nut gene could cause allergic reactions in Brazil nuts sensitive humans (Nordlee et al., 1996).

<P>The discovery of the allergenic potential of Pioneer's genetically engineered soybean prior to its use as human food sources was thanks to a unique advantage: the donor organism for the gene, Brazil nut, was a known food allergen, and serum samples of persons known to be allergic to brazil nuts were available for testing. However, in many cases it is not genes from long known food plants that are transferred into crops. Genes from bacteria which have never been part of the diet are more common components.  This is the case with Monsanto's RRS. Who knows what the allergenic potential of this newly introduced gene product will be?  It is uncertain, unpredictable and untestable (Nestle, 1996).

Greenpeace press release on EU corn decision


<H3>EU COMMISSION OPENS FLOODGATES TO GENETIC HAZARD</H3>
 
Brussells, 18 December 1996 -- Greenpeace has strongly criticised the
European Commission's failure to protect Europe's environment and
citizens' rights when it approved today the authorisation of Ciba
Geigy's genetech maize.
 
<p>For the first time genetically engineered crops can be legally grown,
imported  and used in food in Europe.
"To release a crop which may increase antibiotic resistance in
dangerous bacteria and could increase  pesticide resistance in
insects is one of the most irresponsible decisions the Commission has
taken," said  Louise Gale of Greenpeace's European Unit. "The known
risks to the environment and to human health have apparently been
swept aside by the Commission."
 
<p>"Once more the Commission has given in to pressure from the genetic
engineering industry and the USA. And, once more the Commission has
ignored its duties to protect the environment and  the public's
health".
 
<p>Greenpeace calls on members states to take control of this dangerous
situation in Europe and to take matters into their own hands.
 
<p>"We recommend that Member States use their EU legal rights to ban the
imports and use of this genetech corn and to take the European
Commission to the European Court of Justice for violating Directive
90/220."
 
<p>"Europe is opening the floodgates to widespread environmental and
health hazards. We will take action to ensure that the food and animal
industry reject genetically manipulated products," said international
campaigner Michelle Sheather.
 
<p>Although the Commission's scientific committees have concluded that
the corn is safe, this has not been the opinion of 13 member states
who oposed approval of the corn last June, after advice from their own
scientific advisers.  Greenpeace has pointed out that the Commission's
scientific committees did not predict the disastrous situation arising
from BSE when animal carcasses were allowed to be used as animal feed.
 
<p>Although not approved, at least  hundred thousand tonnes of US corn --
some of it genetically engineered and therefore illegal -- has arrived
and continues to arrive in Europe, including the Netherlands, Belgium,
Finland, Italy, Portugal and the UK.<br>

<p><b>BBC-2 Television "Newsnight" Wednesday 18th December 1996</b>

<h4>Genetically-engineered corn: Extracts from an interview with Professor Derek Burke (in Cambridge)</H4>

<p>Presenter (Peter Snow): "I am joined from Cambridge by Professor Derek Burke, who
is the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government on this food issue.

<p>"Professor Burke, you've heard the Commissioner (i.e.,
Ritt Bjerregaard - EU Environment Commissioner). She's consulted three scientific committees, they've come back with their answer and she is persuaded that this stuff is safe. Is it safe?"

<p>Professor Derek Burke:
"Let me first of all reassure many of your viewers about
some of the things that were said earlier in the programme. Nobody is going to eat this corn. It is not the corn you buy in supermarkets, it's not the corn that's used for human consumption, it's the corn that's fed to cattle. Most of the corn we import from the United States is processed and finishes up as pellets. Those pellets are absolutely safe. So we're only talking about corn that is imported that is fed to cattle and we were concerned about that. But even that's not a major problem this year. There's fifteen thousand tonnes going to be imported this year from the US of this unprocessed corn and around point six per cent of that will be the genetically- modified form."

<p>Presenter:
"But let's cut through all this. There are still going to
be products in the shops that are the final result of all this."

<p>Professor Burke:
"No."

<p>Presenter:
"Surely? It can be fed to animals and we'll eventually
find that ending up in the shops?"

<p>Professor Burke:
"The products you'll find in the shops have all been
treated in such a way that the genetic material that we're worried about has been completely degraded. I can reassure your viewers that the products in the shops are safe. What we're concerned about is transfer of antibiotic resistance to cattle and ultimately into the population. This is not a problem of food safety, it's more a problem of medical safety and we were concerned and, as you say, the European Commission has decided that our concerns are not sufficient to hold back the product."

<p>Presenter:
"Well, are you reassured or not? Do you still insist on
what you originally said: that we were concerned - or not?"

<p>Professor Burke:
"Yes, we still hold our original view but you've got to
understand, Peter, that we're all working in areas where our knowledge is limited. We've taken a rather more cautious view, the European committees have taken a less cautious view, but both of us are working in areas where we're not absolutely certain what would happen and I would prefer to be cautious in those circumstances."

<p>Presenter:
"What does that mean, then? Do you think this stuff
should be coming into this country or not?"

<p>Professor Burke:
"That's still my view: that it shouldn't be coming into
this country..."

<p>Presenter:
"So what are you going to do about it?"

<p>Professor Burke:
"Well, I think the EU has now made a decision which is
binding. What we should now do is start to discover what we can do next year, when there will be much more of the genetically-modified corn coming through. And we shall also try and find out whether any of the concerns that our Committee had are real in practice. And there are experiments we can do to actually monitor the effects of the corn on the cattle and I think we should be doing those."

<p>Presenter:
"In the meantime, should you be saying to the Government-
or should the Government be saying on your advice - this stuff is not yet cleared, we don't think it's yet safe, it should be held back until we're satisfied it is."

<p>Professor Burke:
"I think the best people to leave to make the decision
are the food manufacturers and retailers, who are very concerned about this issue - as I am - and who are likely to..."

<p>Presenter:
"One food manufacturer - well, I suppose he's not exactly
a food manufacturer - we heard the gentleman from Ciba-Geigy saying life is not risk-free."

<p>Professor Burke:
"No but you'll find that food retailers are very
sensitive to their consumers. The last thing they want to do is drive people away from their doors. I think they will probably take steps to limit or exclude this GM corn from the UK this year and they'll make a decision later this week. So there are things that can be done to keep Britain free of this problem. Meantime we've really got to settle down and decide how we're going to handle it next year."

<p>Presenter:
"In one word, is this in a sense, if this stuff is not
prevented coming in, is this in the nature of a serious health worry in the long-term or not? How urgently would you try and persuade the Government to take action now?"

<p>Professor Burke:
"It's not a catastrophe, it's not a plague that's coming
upon us but it's something we should deal with because we're going to have other issues like this coming and, as your commentator said, food is now a commodity product, we can't separate out these different things. We're going to have to find ways of handling them."

Maize that has been genetically altered is being illegally imported into Europe, according to the European Commission. Marius Enthoven, head of the commission's environment arm, told member states late last month that, since the beggining of October, "4000 to 5000 tonnes of maize have been entering the community market every week".

<p>Most of the maize comes from the US, where about 1 per cent of this years crop is a strain developed by the Swiss based multinational firm Ciba-Geigy, containing a bacterial gene for Bt, an insecticide. As American traders have not been segregating the altered grain, "it is to be expected" that the imports contain "non-authorised Bt maize", Enthoven wrote to member states. 

<p>European Union approval for imports of Ciba-Geigy's maize has been delayed due to British fears that a gene in the plant that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin might jump to bacteria. A decision awaits the advice of three scientific committees.<br>

<H3>Retailers and Food Manufacturers. Who is doing what?</H3> As of 22 Nov 1996<BR>

<P>Unilever UK are say it is not possible to avoid using genetically engineered soya in their products (Flora, Blue Band & I Can't Believe Its Not Butter margarines, Magnum, Cornetto, Solero and other ice creams, Birds Eye frozen foods). This is strange as Unilever Germany have stated that they will not be using soya until they can be assured of natural sources for the 20 million bushels they use each year. 

<P>Meanwhile Kraft Jacobs Suchard are putting their customers  first. The fourth biggest food producer in Europe, are showing that it is not necessary to use genetically modified soya. Their products include Maxwell House Coffee, Angel Delight & Birds Custards deserts, Philadelphia & Dairy Lea cheeses, Terry's chocolates and Vitalite margarine. On November 4th 1996 they faxed the following statement to Greenpeace International:

<P><I>We would very much agree with you that the circumstances surrounding the introduction of genetically modified soya into the European market are totally unsatisfactory from everyone's perspective - producer, consumer, processor and food manufacturer.

Currently, and for the foreseeable future, all soya based ingredients in KJS's products in Europe will be derived from conventionally grown soya. Any change in that practice in future will most assuredly be disclosed.</I><BR>
<BR>


<P>Among UK retailers, Sainsbury's are doing the least. Earlier this year, in a leaflet that accompanied genetically engineered tomato purée, they promised; "If Sainsbury's are to sell further products developed with the aid of genetic modification, these will be labelled." They are now intending to break this promise. On the 18th September 1996 Sainsbury's withdrew instructions to Nestlé regarding  segregation of genetically engineered soya and labelling of products containing it. They later announced "we have been forced to accept that we won't be able to label (soya products) separately." <a href="arthur.html">(Article in <I>The Independent </I> 21.10.96)</a> 

<P>Iceland Frozen Foods are at the moment the only  UK retail chain making a serious effort to ensure their customers right to buy natural food. They say "we have contacted all our suppliers and requested immediate details of their supply chain.......we are now pursuing details of suppliers for 1998 and beyond".

<H3>FIRST MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON</H3>

I first met Brian Anderson the chairman and managing director of Shell Nigeria on the Queens birthday party 1995 in Lagos, and he promises to my wife to help, to see that Ken gets adequate medical attention, he says he will see what he can do and we leave at the end of the party and I write of my encounter to Ken send it through my wife who leaves this day to see Ken and through this letter we are very happy to learn that Ken has been taken to the hospital the military hospital for the first time after being in detention for about 11 months.  (<a href="1stmeet.vmd">1:04 min Iwave file</a>)

<H3>SECOND MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON</H3><p>
 <p>
Well I asked him if he would use his influence to stop the trial announced so that Ken can get can get out of the illegal detention and so that negotiation can start between Shell and the Ogoni people. And he says that's difficult, but not impossible but that the international campaign is hurting Shell and the Nigerian government and if we can stop the campaign that he might be able to do something.<p>
 <p>
So I tell him that I don't have the power to do that, but however I will pass the information to Ken,  and he also at that time said I should try and get into the press - to get a press release and get him a copy, you know mentioning the fact that there is no environmental devastation in Ogoniland and I just say how can I do that, you mean I tell the world that what we've been saying ever since 1990 is a lie, there is no way I will do that.  And that happened at our second meeting.  (<a href="2ndmeet.vmd">1:48 min Iwave file</a>)<p>

<H3>THIRD MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON</H3><p>
 <p>
I wrote to Ken and Ken replied back with a letter to Brian Anderson where he gives him two scenarios. The first one - Ken gets killed and becomes a martyr or they [Shell] did the right thing, use their influence with the Nigerian government and get him out of their illegal detention and stop the charade of the tribunal. And when that happens the lobby with the writers will stop, the lobby by the human rights groups will stop and that remains the environmental campaigners and when the environmental lobby sees that he is now discussing with Shell they will lower or stop their campaign.<p>
 <p>
Mr Brian Anderson tells me that he will no longer be available for further discussion as he'll be travelling frequently but that I should continue the discussion with Mr Achebe.  Mr Achebe stresses the importance of continuous dialogue and after a week I phone Achebe and I'm told he's in Germany I phone again a second time and I'm told he's in Abucja and I phone again and I'm told he's in Port Harcourt holding meetings with other Ogoni people and I phone another time and he's not in the office and all this time I'm leaving my number and my messages and I don't get any reply so I now switch back to phone Anderson both in his office and in his house.  Now I phoned the first time in his house and they tell me he's at a cocktail party I phone another time and he's having lunch and I ask whether I can phone after lunch I don't get any answer, but I still phone and still he's not available and I phone another time and I hear he's not around you know and then I sort if get the message and I write back to Ken that it appears that I'm being avoided and Ken writes back - that I shouldn't bother as it appears a decision has been made.

<H3>DEVASTATION OF OGONILAND</H3><p>
 <p>
Ogoni environment is devastated. I got involved in Ogoniland after coming back to Ogoni after my University medical school and then the first thing that struck me is that the trees around my father's house the oranges and the guavas are no longer there the ones there are not producing any fruit and they sort of shrunken. Then I go to the hospital and the spectrum of diseases I see there is quite different from the ones I was taught at school or the ones I saw in other places I'd worked in Nigeria. A lot of respiratory diseases - high incidence of asthma, cancer, bronchitis and I'm quite surprised and also some bizarre skin diseases and a high level of miscarriages which is quite different from other areas in Nigeria that are not producing oil. And the land Ogoni is a small place  about 404 square miles 12 miles by 32 and large expanse of land that nothing grows on because of the oil spillages that have happened because of oil blow outs gas flares all over Ogoniland. You don't know when it is night it's always glowing. With the noise from the flow stations - it's very deafening and the people speak rather they shout the way of talking because they have to get across to the other person. And the pipe line gas and oil pipelines criss-crossing the whole place on the surface of the ground passing in front of houses at the back of houses on farm land unprotected.

<H3>SHELL CLAIM SABOTAGE BY OGONI</H3><p>
 <p>
Shell claims that the environmental devastation in Ogoniland is due to sabotage of the installations by Ogoni people, as far as I know no Ogoni person no MOSOP activist has ever been convicted of sabotage of oil installations. The Ogoni people would be the last people on earth to go near the Shell installations because they know that if anything goes wrong on the pipelines or on the installations it is their land which they hold precious that will be spoiled - that will be devastated it is their streams from which they fish and drink water that will be polluted because their is no piped on water in Ogoniland it's only the water from the streams so no Ogoni person will go near any Shell installation for sabotage because that would lead to spillage and we understand spillages and devastated land more than any people in this world.

<H3>EVIDENCE THAT SHELL ARE INVOLVED WITH MILITARY</H3><p>
 <p>
I drive down to the village of Korokor-tai when I get there I meet another young man on the ground in a pool of blood at the feet of his mother and I'm told that he was shot by Major [Okuntino??] who had come there in the Shell bus accompanied by Shell executives and they had come to the village, said they were coming to look for Shell trucks. In my clinic in Bori Ogoniland I see the police constable coming to my clinic to tell me that all Ogoni people in the police in Ogoni land have been transferred out and I'm scared and he shows me the posting order transferring them and immediately I get to my car because that's frightening and go to visit my brother in hospital and I tell him what I've just heard and give him the police posting order and he immediately writes on it telling the world about what is happening and he's afraid that the first episode of genocide is being planned against the people, the Ogoni people.<p>
 <p>
I see foreign journalists in Bori and I ask what's happening they said they heard that there's shooting a journalist from the Guardian of London and one from the Independent.  And I take them to the village Kaa where most of my patients come from and we arrive there and it's like a small atomic bomb has been placed on the village I mean dropped on the village, everything the market is completely destroyed, the school the houses even the trees are on the ground and it is very very frightening and we do know this time there were police, I mean a military presence in Ogoniland. They were stationed not too far from my clinic so I go back to the army and ask them what has happened, and we go back there and they see the place and one of the officials says that he hasn't seen this sort of thing even while he was serving in Liberia that no destruction has ever been to this level and in that particular incident 35 people are killed and it continues like that another 7 Ogoni villages are all destroyed and a total of about one thousand people are killed in these raids by people using sophisticated weapons on unarmed villages and my patients tell me that the soldiers arrived across Andoni river with Shell boats  and while all this is going on we notice the presence of Shell helicopters hovering around and we're actually very very worried.

<H3>DETENTION OF OWENS WIWA</H3><p>
 <p>
On the 26th December 1993 on Boxing day I'm in my house with my wife who's pregnant and her sister as well come to spend Christmas with us and a captain in the Nigerian army Captain Tunde Odina comes in and has a beer in my house and eats the food my wife has prepared and at the end of it he tells me to take a holiday, to leave Ogoniland go to Lagos or somewhere.<p>
 <p>
At about 5 O'clock another Major comes in he calls himself Major Akintola of the Army Intelligence Unit at the Brigade in Bori camp and he tells me that the governor of the state Lieutenant Colonel Komo wants to see me and Barika Idamkue because at this time Barika Idamkue is the secretary of the Ogoni Relief and Rehabilitation Committee and I'm the coordinator so I mean we go there happily thinking that the Governor wants to give some relief to the people so at the end of the conversation I tell him that I was told by a captain, Captain Tunde Odina that I was to be arrested.  So the Governor tells me that is not true that is just one of the rumours that we hear and keep telling people and there's nothing like that so I go back to my house have dinner with my family and go to bed.<p>
 <p>
At about 2am the same captain who had come to my house you know to eat and drink comes in shouting, breaking my door and asks where is Dr Wiwa, I say well I'm here and then the other soldiers climb the fence and generally make noise and then I ask what is the matter and he tells me you are, by the order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria you are under arrest.  So I go back to my room change into my clothes and go into the 504 military vehicle and the other soldiers enter squeeze me in and they take me straight to the country home of Mr Ledum Mitee the Deputy President of MOSOP and repeat the same sort of thing they did in my house and bring the guy into the car and then the soldiers are coming inside too with their guns reeking of alcohol and marijuana and generally threatening us you know, and took us straight to the Air force base in Port Harcourt and later to the house of the government reservation division in Port Harcourt.<p>
 <p>
And we stayed there until the 4th of January at about 5 O'clock or so Major Okuntimo comes in to meet us and to discuss.  We ask him why we are detained he doesn't tell us anything, all he says is he's following his orders and then curiously asks us that since MOSOP is big it's powerful that we should join forces with him you know to see that one Mr Lawson-Jack senior executive of Shell in Port Harcourt is removed and we tell him that we don't do things like that.  We talk about ideas and how to change corporate behaviour in terms of the environmental devastation of Ogoniland we are not in for removing individuals and all that and he insist and so we ask him why, why do you want the man off? and then he explains that the man has been undercutting him in his payments that he was also receiving from Shell.<p>
 <p>
And after our discussion he tells us that we are released and on getting out I meet my mother-in-law and I ask about my wife and she answers that they are fine, I say what do you mean they are fine?  I only have one wife, so she says they are fine that you have a child I said a child ?, she said yes, a son, I said yes how do I know it's a son I said I dreamt you know but then my wife is not due but I rushed down to the hospital that she's supposed to have delivered and I go in there and see her very happy and beside her there's, there's a young kid you know all red and cries when he sees me and I go and pick up my son and I feel very happy and I decide to forget and forgive my detention because that has brought me a son and asked my wife how everything happens and she tells me that after they are taking me away after some hours when daylight was coming she decides to come and look for me.  And at this time there are many roadblocks manned by the army in Ogoniland and she is stopped in one of the roadblocks and she comes out, she is asked to come out of the car, she comes out and they ask her who she is and she tells the person that she's my wife and they say Oh that trouble maker so they ask her to identify herself further , she says she's a housewife and housewives don't carry ID cards. So they search her and they decide to search her person and she doesn't like that and the army man tell her to go into the stream, the stream is polluted covered with oil, my wife doesn't know how to swim.  She protests, she gets the gun, they put up the gun pushing her from the back and she is pushed into the pond, into the stream but because of her hydrophobia she comes out and then the man aims the nozzle of the gun at her pregnant abdomen and then contractions start to come on and that process leads her to the hospital and my baby comes out born on January 4th Ogoni day and that's how I get my child.
