<b>3.  Dosage Form</b><p>
Suspension 22.5&#37; (225 mg/ml) for administration intraruminally, using the rumen
injector, or orally, using appropriate dosing equipment.<p>
Suspension 9.06&#37; (90.6 mg/ml) for oral administration only using appropriate
dosing equipment.<p>
<B>Dosage:</B>  4.5 mg oxfendazole/kg body weight (2.05 mg/lb).<p>

<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
Oxfendazole was identified in the laboratories of Syntex Research, Palo Alto,
California, as having broad spectrum anthelmintic properties against larval and
adult forms of gastrointestinal cestodes and nematodes in various animal
species. The drug was therefore evaluated for efficacy in cattle both within
the United States and internationally.<p>
In the United States, pivotal studies using the intraruminal method of delivery
included dose-titration studies, dose-confirmation studies, and clinical field
trials in five different geographical areas. Doses of 2.25 to 6.75 mg 
oxfendazole/kg of body weight were used in the dose-titration studies, while a
dose of 4.5 mg/kg was used for the dose-confirmation and field trial studies.
Oxfendazole was supplied to the investigators as a 22.5&#37; suspension which was
administered either intraruminally or orally. For oral administration only, the
drug was supplied to investigators as a 9.06&#37; suspension. The drug was
evaluated for efficacy in controlled critical trials where groups of naturally
infected animals were treated with the compound, sacrificed approximately 14
days later, and the remaining parasitic burdens compared to those of control
animals. These dose titration and dose-confirmation studies were conducted by
Dr. M. Sharp, Vernon, Texas; Drs. J. A. Hawkins and C. Ed Couvillion,
Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, Mississippi; Dr. J. E. Miller,
Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.<p>
Internationally, a series of pivotal studies were conducted by Dr. J. Berger,
the Wellcome Foundation Ltd., Kwanyanga, South Africa, in animals artificially
infected with various nematodes. One study involved animals naturally infected
with tapeworms (<i>Moniezia benedeni </i>). These studies were conducted using
the 9.06&#37; oxfendazole suspension (See Table:  Efficacy of Oxfendazole in 
Controlled Critical Studies Against Various Parasites At 4.5 mg/kg).<p>
Each claim for a larval or adult form of a helminth species is supported by
adequate and well controlled studies.<p>

 The efficacy was calculated as follows:<p>
 <pre>

   Number of parasites in control animals - 
   Number of parasites in treated animals
-----------------------------------------------  x  100  &#61;  &#37; Removal
   Number of parasites in control animals   
   
   
   </pre>
The data were then analyzed statistically by parametric and nonparametric
methods. The results of these analyses support the claim that, in cattle,
oxfendazole is highly effective anthelmintic with a wide range of activity at a
dose of 4.5 mg/kg of body weight.<p>

Twenty calves of mixed sexes were obtained from suppliers in south Texas.
Equal numbers of animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Group 1
animals were treated with 4.5 mg/kg of oxfendazole while the control animals in
Group 2 were untreated. Treatments were administered by intraruminal injection
using the 22.5&#37; suspension. There were no adverse reactions reported during
the course of the study. All animals were necropsied seven days after
treatment. Oxfendazole was 100&#37; efficacious in removing the adults stage of
the following species:  <i>O. ostertagi, Haemonchus</i>&#160;spp., <i>T.
axei, O. radiatum, Cooperia</i>&#160;spp., and <i>D. viviparus</i>.
Although they were not totally eliminated, the L4 stages of <i>O. ostertagi</i>&#160;
were significantly reduced. The percent efficacy for the Developing L4 was 70&#37;

to cattle at a rate of 4.5 mg/kg of body weight. Seven treated steers were
compared to seven control steers seven days after treatment. The efficacies
for early L-4, L-4, and adults were 92.6, 96.8, and 99.7&#37; respectively.<p>

Twelve Fresian calves harboring naturally acquired infections of <i>D.
viviparus</i>&#160;were used in a control project to test the efficacy of
oxfendazole at 2.5 mg/kg. The 2.5 mg/kg dose rate was 100&#37; effective
against all stages of <i>D. viviparus</i>.<p>

Oxfendazole at the dose rate of 4.53 mg/kg was 100&#37; effective in removing adult
and immature stages of <i>D. viviparus</i>&#160;in yearling calves. The absence of
larvae in the faeces of the treated animals is a positive factor in the control
of bovine husk.<p>

An overall efficacy of 99.5&#37; against adults and inhibited larvae of <i>O.
ostertagi</i>&#160;with total elimination (100&#37;) of the other abomasal parasite
<i>T. axei</i>&#160;is excellent. In addition a 100&#37; reduction of the intestinal
nematode <i>C. oncophora</i>&#160;shows this to be an extremely effective
anthelmintic for use in the treatment of bovine parasitic gastroenteritis.<p>

Weaner cattle, carrying naturally acquired burdens of gastrointestinal
nematodes, were treated with oxfendazole at a dose of 4.53 mg/kg. Complete
clearance of adult <i>H. placei</i>, and immature <i>Cooperia</i>&#160;spp. was
effected; and against adult <i>O. ostertagi</i>, <i>T. axei</i>,
<i>Cooperia</i>&#160;spp. and <i>O. radiatum</i>&#160;efficacies of 99.9&#37;, 99.6&#37;, 99.9&#37;
and 99.5&#37;, respectively were recorded.<p>
<B>Clinical Field Trials</B><p>
The effectiveness of oxfendazole has been evaluated in clinical field trials.
These trials were conducted by Julian H. Edwards, D.V.M., Scotland Neck, NC;
Ross A. Hendry, D.V.M., Brandenton, FL; Edward O. Kearley, D.V.M., Ceres, CA;
Larry E. Mehr, D.V.M., Memphis, TN; and Daryl G. Meyer, D.V.M., Gothenburg,
NE.<p>
Each of five investigators selected approximately 100 cattle for field trials
to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of intraruminally-administered
oxfendazole. Group 1 animals were treated with a 22.5&#37; oxfendazole suspension
by intraruminal injection, at a dose rate of 4.5 mg per kg of live body weight.
Group 2 animals were untreated controls. Fecal samples were collected prior to
treatment for EPG (eggs per gram) determination and again approximately 7 to 11
days post-treatment. There were no adverse reactions recorded during the
course of the trials.<p>
In four of the five trials, oxfendazole treatment was effective in reducing the
fecal egg counts (p&#60;.001); the median reduction ranged from 92&#37; to 100&#37;. In
the remaining trial, the median reduction for oxfendazole was 100&#37; while the
median reduction for the controls was 0&#37;. However, the oxfendazole advantage
was not significant (p&#61;.19), possibly due to sampling errors.<p>

<B>Additional Study - Pharmacokinetics</B><p>
<B>Biocomparability Study (corroborative), K. Bairden, Glasgow University,
Scotland - Study IAS 1103-C470</B><p>
The pharmacokinetics of oxfendazole were not significantly different when
administered orally or by intraruminal injection. A 4.5 mg/kg dose of
oxfendazole produced peak plasma concentrations of 0.20 &#181;g by the intraruminal
injection route and 0.18 &#181;g by the oral route. Both routes produced nearly
identical areas under the curve. For both routes, efficacy against inhibited
L-4 <i>O. ostertagi</i>&#160;was 97&#37;, 100&#37; for adult <i>O. ostertagi</i>, and 100&#37;
for all stages of <i>C. oncophora</i>.<p>
<b>5. Target Species Safety</b><p>
The following studies to evaluate the safety of oxfendazole were performed both
in the United States and internationally:<p>
<B>A. Pivotal Studies</B><p>
<B>Acute and Sub-Acute Target Species Toxicity Study</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>1) Target Species Safety Study (pivotal), R.D. Glock, Casa Grande, AZ -
Study ITS 42-CW-85</B><p>
Three each of 6- to 8-month-old mixed beef-breed heifers and bulls were
assigned randomly to 5 treatment groups. The test article was 22.5&#37;
oxfendazole suspension. Control animals received intraruminal doses of
unmedicated suspension. Cattle received doses of 0, 4.5, 13.5, or 22.5 mg of
oxfendazole per kilogram of body weight intraruminally via injection through
the left paralumbar fossa on study days 1, 4, and 8. Cattle receiving  112.5
mg/kg were given a single intraruminal dose. Necropsies were performed 10 days
after the last dose of animals receiving 0 through 22.5 mg/kg; necropsies were
performed 14 days after the single dose of 112.5mg/kg. Predose and terminal
body weights and hematologic and clinical chemistry values were determined.
Multiple clinical observations were made daily.<p>
The single intraruminal dose of 112.5 mg/kg caused only transient gastric
disturbance characterized by non-productive eructation in one of three males
and in one of three females. Minor swellings occurred at the sites of  the
multiple injections in some animals in all groups, including controls.<p>
Hematologic data, clinical chemistry values, and body weights were not
altered by the treatment regimen. No gross or microscopic pathologic change
attributable to oxfendazole treatment was observed in any dose group.</ul><p>
<B>Reproductive Studies:</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>2) Target Species Reproductive Study - Heifers (pivotal), T.A. Miller,
Milford, IN - Study ITS 44-CW-85</B><p>
Ninety-nine beef type heifers were randomized into three equal groups, were
estrus synchronized using
fenprostalene, and artificially inseminated with semen from an Angus bull.
Heifers that did not conceive following artificial insemination were bred
naturally. Oxfendazole, as 22.5&#37; suspension, was administered intraruminally
in individual doses of 4.5 or 13.5 mg/kg. Corresponding control cattle received
doses of water intraruminally. Oxfendazole suspension or water was
administered prior to artificial insemination and at weekly intervals from day
14 through day 42 of gestation and at approximately 60 day intervals for the
remainder of the gestation. Dosing continued at approximately monthly
intervals for two months during lactation. The study terminated when the
calves were approximately 90 days old. Intraruminally-administered oxfendazole
in multiple doses did NOT cause:<p>
a)  anatomical abnormalities in calves<br>
b)  decreases in calf birth weights<br>
c)  decreases in average daily weight gain of calves<br>
d)  alterations in conception rates<br>
e)  alterations in length of gestation for artificially or naturally bred
heifers<br>
f)  alterations in time to pregnancy<br>
g)  increases in the number of services required for pregnancy<br>
h)  adverse effects on weight gains of heifers during gestation or
lactation.<p>
<LI><B>3) Target Species Reproductive Study - Bulls (pivotal), Robert H. BonDurant,
University of California, Davis, CA ITS 18-BO-86</B><p>
Eighteen sexually mature mixed beef-breed bulls were assigned randomly to 3
treatment groups of 6 bulls each. Scrotal circumference was used as the
randomization factor for study group assignments. Groups 1, 2, and 3   were
designated as control, 1X oxfendazole, or 3X oxfendazole groups, respectively.
Doses were 0 (vehicle), 4.5, and 13.5 mg oxfendazole/kg for groups 1, 2, and
3, respectively. Test materials were vehicle suspension (control) which
contained no oxfendazole, and 22.5&#37; oxfendazole suspension. Oxfendazole was
administered at one or three times the intended clinical use level. Three
doses of the test materials were administered by intraruminal injection within
8 days, (e.g., study days 1, 4, and 8). Breeding soundness parameters,
including scrotal circumference measurement, assessment of sperm morphology,
sperm motility, semen volume, and sperm counts, were evaluated during the
4-week acclimatization period and at weekly intervals for the 14-week
observation period following treatment.<p>
Oxfendazole administered intraruminally three times within 8 days at doses of
one or three times the intended clinical use level did not cause effects on
breeding soundness parameters, weight gains, or clinical health of sexually
mature beef bulls.</ul><p>
<B>B. Corroborative Studies:</B><p>
<B>Acute Target Species Toxicity Studies</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>1) Target Species Safety Study (corroborative), Syntex Research, Palo Alto,
CA. - Studies 50X-8858-CA and 73-CW-76</B><p>
Three each young, beef-type steers and heifers were dosed once with 125 mg/kg
oxfendazole, as the 2.265&#37;  suspension, using a small bore (1/4 inch) stomach
tube. Clinical observations in the drug treated cattle included reduced
appetite, feed consumption and rumen activity, fever, diarrhea, weight loss,
and general weakness. Four of the six animals died prior to the end of the 14-day
observation period. Gross gastrointestinal changes,observed at necropsy,
included congestion, mucosal erosions/ulcers, hemorrhage, free blood with
fibrin, and sloughed mucosa along with increased fluid contents. Healed
gastric ulcers were present in one survivor.<p>
Five each young crossbred beef-type heifers were administered single doses of
either 0, 2.5, or 12.5 mg/kg oxfendazole, as the 2.265&#37; suspension, by stomach
tube. No clinical signs of oxfendazole toxicosis were 
observed and all cattle survived the one-week observation period. Body
weights, feed intakes, hematology values, clinical chemistry parameters, or
urinalysis values were not altered by the treatment regimen. There were no
gross or microscopic pathologic changes nor alterations in organ weights or
organ weight to body weight ratios attributable to oxfendazole treatment.<p>
<LI><B>2)  Target Species Safety Study (corroborative), Syntex Research, Palo Alto,
CA - Study IAS 1103-339</B><p>
This study was conducted to determine the reliability of the intraruminal
device to deposit test material into the contents of the rumen. When the
device was intact, it was found to enter the rumen consistently (100&#37;) in 239
animals. Three additional animals were injected unsuccessfully when a part of
the device became unglued. This device was a prototype and the production
model has greater reliability. It was concluded that, in the absence of
mechanical failure, the device was 100&#37; accurate for the intraruminal
administration of pharmaceutical preparations.<p>
<LI><B>3)  Target Species Safety Study (corroborative), J.F.S. Reid and S.P. Dean,
Syntex Research, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium - Study IAS 1103-C611</B><p>
A total of 4,239 animals, weighing from 100 to 550 kg, were administered
oxfendazole intraruminally using the intraruminal injector. The animals were
located in various areas of Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.  By 24
hours after injection, 91 animals (2.2&#37;) had slight post-treatment reactions
ranging from slight bleeding to swellings at the injection sight. After 7
days, all reactions had disappeared. It was concluded that the intraruminal
administration of oxfendazole was safe and reliable whether used by a
veterinarian or a layman.<p>
<LI><B>4)  Target Species Safety Study (corroborative), J.F.S. Reid, Syntex
Research, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium -   Study IAS 1103-C453</B><p>
A total of 562 steers, heifers, and bulls weighing from 150 to 400 kg were
administered oxfendazole intraruminally using the intraruminal injector. The
animals were located in various areas of Ireland. By 24 hours after
injection, only 22 animals (4&#37;) showed minor swelling up to 6 cm at the
injection site. It was concluded that the intraruminal administration of
oxfendazole was safe and reliable whether used by a veterinarian or layman.<p>
<LI><B>5)  Target Species Safety Study (corroborative), P.J. Kieran et al, Wellcome
Research Foundation, Sydney,Australia Study IAS 1103-C398</B><p>
Over 5,000 cattle, located in New Zealand and Australia, were administered
oxfendazole intraruminally using the intraruminal injector. All injections
were made by laymen. Of the 114 reactions recorded in these animals(&#60;3&#37;),
14 were abscesses, 60 were lumps in the abdominal wall, 3 were plaques, and 37
had a thickening of the skin in the injection area. Most of these reactions
were seen in cattle that were wet when treated with the rumen injector. It
was concluded that treatment with the rumen injector is contraindicated when
the animals are wet. No treatment-related losses were recorded in any of the
slaughtered animals.<p>
<LI><B>6)  Target Species Safety Study (corroborative), J.B. Bentley, Wellcome,
Australia - Study IAS 1067-C152</B><p>
The safety of 90.6 g/l oxfendazole cattle concentrate formulation at 5, 10, 15
mg/kg was demonstrated under field conditions on properties located in New
South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia and involved the treatment of 914
head of cattle. Cattle were treated at 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg and
concurrent treatment carried out with flukicide, lousicides, vaccines and
injectable copper. No adverse reactions alone or in conjunction with the
ancillary treatments simultaneously applied were observed.</ul><p>

<B>Sub-chronic Toxicity Studies in Rats:</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>Investigator: Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA, - Study 30-R-76</B><p>
Equivalent doses of oxfendazole or mebendazole were administered by gavage
daily for 2 weeks to groups of rats in doses ranging from 5 to 160 mg/kg/day.
At doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg/day of oxfendazole, neutrophil levels  were
depressed at the end of the dosing period. When examined again after a
two-week drug-withdrawal period, neutrophil levels in oxfendazole dose groups
had returned to control values. Within the dose range tested, mebendazole did
not affect neutrophil levels.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 38-R-75</B><p>
Oxfendazole was administered to rats by gavage at levels of 11, 33, or 100
mg/kg/day for 14 days. Decreased weight gain was seen in females treated with
33 mg/kg/day of oxfendazole and in both males and females treated with 100
mg/kg/day of oxfendazole. At the end of the two-week dosing period, no
differences between drug-treated and control animals were observed in clinical
chemistries. Decreased neutrophil levels were observed in the females given
33 mg/kg/day and in both males and females given 100 mg/kg/day. Reduced
hemoglobin and  hematocrit values were also noted in females given 100
mg/kg/day. Hepatocytic vacuolation was seen at all doses of oxfendazole.
Doses of 33 and 100 mg/kg/day were associated with gastroenteropathy and
reduced activity in lymphoid, testicular and bone marrow tissues.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 108-R-74</B><p>
Oxfendazole was compared to a related series of candidate compounds in a
1-month study in rats. Each compound was admixed with the diet at a level of
600 ppm and administered to a group of male and female rats. Oxfendazole was
associated with decreased neutrophil levels and/or decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit
levels. SGOT levels were
slightly increased  with all test compounds and hepatic enlargement was evident
with oxfendazole.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Bio/dynamics Inc., East Millstone, New Jersey - Study
256-R-73</B><p>
In a three-month oral dosing study using rats, oxfendazole was admixed with
the diet. The study was originally started using dietary levels of 200, 600,
or 2000 ppm. However, since 13/30 rats fed the 2000 ppm diet died by the end
of the first week of dosing, this group was terminated and additional groups
were started which were fed diets containing 50 or 100 ppm of oxfendazole. By
the end of the 3-month feeding period, 24/30 rats fed the 600 ppm diet had
died. There were no deaths in any of the other groups.<p>
At the end of the three-month feeding period, dose-related changes were seen
in the liver, consisting of hepatocytic hypertrophy, vacuolation and/or
rarefaction in the rats fed the 600 ppm diet. Minimal to slight hepatocytic
hypertrophy was seen in 4/20 rats fed the 200 ppm diet. No gross or
microscopic changes related to  treatment were seen in livers of rats fed 100
or 50 ppm of oxfendazole.<p>
Related clinical chemistry changes included elevation of plasma glutamic
transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels in the 600 ppm group. Slightly
elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were seen in both sexes of the 200 ppm
group and in the 100 ppm females.<p>
Other pathologic changes seen in the rats from the 600 ppm group consisted of
testicular atrophy, splenic necrosis or atrophy, abscesses and bone marrow
hyperplasia or diffuse atrophy.</ul><p>
<B>Sub-acute Toxicity Studies in Beagle dogs:</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Bio/dynamics Inc., East Millstone, New Jersey - Study
257-D-73</B><p>
Oxfendazole was administered to dogs in hard shell gelatin capsules at doses
of 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg/day for three months. No meaningful differences were
seen between these dogs and control dogs given empty gelatin capsules in
hematology, clinical chemistry or in gross or microscopic pathology when then
dogs were sacrificed at the end of the dosing period.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 39-D-75</B><p>
An oxfendazole formulation was administered by gavage to dogs for two weeks at
11, 33 or 100 mg/kg/day. Reduced myeloid maturation in bone marrow was seen
in some dogs in all drug-treated groups. In addition, most drug-treated male
dogs exhibited reduced splenic lymphoid tissue and thymic atrophy. No
meaningful changes were seen in any of the other parameters examined.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator: Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 97-D-76</B><p>
In a 2 week study in dogs, oxfendazole was administered at 3, 6, or 11

drug-related effects were noted.</ul><p>
<B>Teratology and Reproduction Studies:</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Bio/dynamics, East Millstone, New Jersey - Study 247-M-73</B><p>
Mice were fed diets containing 200, 600, or 2000 ppm of oxfendazole during the
period of organogenesis. The diet containing 2000 ppm of oxfendazole was
fetotoxic for mice. Only 2/22 mice maintained pregnancies through day 18 of
pregnancy and in these two pregnancies there were three live fetuses and one
dead fetus.Neither fetotoxicity or teratologic changes were seen when mice
were fed diets containing either 200 or 600 ppm of oxfendazole during
organogenesis. The dietary level of 200 ppm (36 mg/kg/day) was considered to
be the no-effect level.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Bio/dynamics, East Millstone, New Jersey - Study 248-R-73</B><p>
Oxfendazole was administered by gavage to rats during the period of
organogenesis at doses of 10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day. These doses correspond to
dietary intakes of 200, 400, or 1200 ppm of oxfendazole, respectively.
Evidence of fetotoxicity characterized by decreased litter size and fetal
weight with a high incidence of total litter resorption was seen
in the group dosed with 60 mg/kg/day. Further evidence of fetotoxicity was
provided by the changes seen in fetuses from animals dosed with either 20 or
60 mg/kg/day of oxfendazole. The changes seen in fetuses from these groups
were typical of those produced by delayed development and included reduced
ossification of the cranial bones, sternebrai and vertebrae. The dose of 10
mg/kg/day, corresponding to a dietary level of 200 ppm of oxfendazole, did not
cause fetotoxic or teratologic changes in the rat.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 48-B-77</B><p>
In rabbits, oxfendazole was administered by gavage at doses of 0, 0.025,
0.125, or 0.625 mg/kg/day during theperiod of organogenesis. No biologically
meaningful changes were seen in maternal parameters which included  litter
size, fetal weight, resorptions, implantations, corpora lutea, gestation
survival index, resorption index and implantation index.<p>
No teratologic change was seen. Minor changes including abnormal carpal and
tarsal flexion, and low incidence of gallbladder hypoplasia or aplasia were
seen in fetuses from treated animals. Although greater numbers of high
dose fetuses had minor skeletal variants, the incidences of these changes were
not significantly different (p&#62;0.05) from the controls. Similar numbers of
control fetuses with those minor skeletal variants have been seen in prior
rabbit studies. The no-effect level was considered to be 0.625 mg/kg/day.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 83-R-84</B><p>
Male rats were administered oxfendazole in their diet at concentrations of 0,
10, 30, or 100 ppm, beginning 10 weeks prior to cohabitation with females.
Females were treated with the same concentrations of oxfendazole until weaning
of the first generation of offspring. Representative F1 animals of both sexes
were treated similarly and then mated to produce an F2 generation.<p>
No drug effect was noted on the clinical condition, mean body weight or
average daily food intake of treated rats. Also, no drug effect was noted for
incidence of pregnancy, length of gestation, live litter size or gestation
index. Upon pathologic examination, one high-dose male had hepatocytic
cytoplasmic vacuolation, and high-dose females had increased mean liver
weights and liver to body vacuolation. Increased incidence of eosinophilic
cytoplasmic material was present in hepatocytes of high-dose females. These
changes were attributed to  oxfendazole treatment.<p>
All dose groups including controls had high pup mortality from postpartum
days 7 to 14. Male F1 pups born to high-dose dams weighed less at first
observation and had a decreased rate of growth compared to male pups from
control dams. At weaning, both male and female pups had statistically
significant lower mean body weights relative to pups from control dams. No
oxfendazole-related anomalies occurred. Pups from high-dose litters that
were submitted to necropsy had liver changes similar to those found in
high-dose parents. The dietary level of 10 ppm (0.8 mg/kg/day) was considered to
be the no-effect level.</ul><p>
<B>Chronic Toxicity Studies in Dogs and Rats</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 18-D-84</B><p>
Beagle dogs were administered oxfendazole orally at levels of 0 (vehicle),
1.5, 4.5, or 13.5 mg/kg/day for one year. Eye examinations, hematology, and
serum chemistry evaluations were conducted predose and at periodic intervals
during treatment. After at least one year of treatment, gross and
histopathologic examinations were performed.<p>
No treatment related changes were noted in in-life observations, clinical
pathology parameters or pathology. Daily oral doses of oxfendazole up to 13.5
mg/kg were well tolerated by beagle dogs, and this was considered to be the
no-effect level.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 101-R-74</B><p>
Rats were administered oxfendazole in the diet at levels of 0, 10, 30, or 100
ppm for one year. Blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry
evaluations were collected at four intervals during the study. Also, eye
examinations were performed predose and at four intervals during the study.
Dietary levels of 30 and 100 ppm of oxfendazole caused mild hepatotoxicity.
At 10 ppm, the only effects observed were physiologic changes in BUN and serum
alkaline phosphatase that were not considered to be biologically meaningful.
The dietary level of 10 ppm (0.7 mg/kg/day) was considered to be the no-effect
level.</ul><p>
<B>Carcinogenicity Studies in Mice and Rats</B><ul><p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 66-M-84</B><p>
Mice were administered oxfendazole in the diet for 18 months at levels of 0,
100, 300, or 1000 ppm. Blood samples were collected from designated animals
at six and twelve months following treatment and at study termination from
surviving animals. Complete necropsies and histopathological examinations were
performed at termination of the study.<p>
No treatment-related effects were noted for clinical condition or survival.
Mean body weights for treated males were often lower than those for controls
during the first year of the study. High-dose females had significantly
higher body weights than controls during the first year. Food intakes were
higher for all treated groups during the first year.<p>
No biologically-significant hematologic effects were noted. There were no
treatment-related increases in the incidence of any type of neoplasm.
Histologically, an increased incidence of hepatocellular vacuolation was
present in high-dose females and the incidence of hepatocytic hypertrophy was
increased in high-dose males. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect
of oxfendazole in mice. The dietary level of 1000 ppm (150 mg/kg/day) was
considered to be the no-effect level.<p>
<LI><B>Investigator:  Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA - Study 53-R-83</B><p>
Oxfendazole was administered to weanling rats of each sex at dietary levels of
10, 30, or 100 ppm. During the two year period, the female dose groups
consumed 0.88, 2.53, and 8.8 mg/kg/day while the males consumed 0.7, 2.1, and
7.0 mg/kg/day of oxfendazole, respectively. The animals were treated for a
minimum of 104  weeks. There were no treatment related clinical signs, and the
survival of the animals was not affected by oxfendazole treatment. No
biologically significant effects were noted on body weight, food intake, or
hematology. There were no treatment-related increases in the incidence of any
type of neoplasm. Hepatocellular vacuolation was present in the livers of 30
and 100 ppm dose groups. No evidence of carcinogenic effect of oxfendazole
was noted in this study. The no-effect level was determined to be 0.7

Total residues of oxfendazole in the tissues of cattle treated with
C-14 oxfendazole were determined in two studies. Study No. 77-CA-29
was a range-finding study and involved four steers and four heifers which each
received a single 4.5 mg/kg dose of C-14 oxfendazole administered by
stomach tube. One calf was sacrificed on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post
dosing, and the remaining four animals were sacrificed as a group at 30 days
post dosing. Radioassay of the tissues gave the results shown below.<p>

Study No. 78-CA-18 was a larger investigation and was conducted with a slightly
higher dose level, 5.0 mg/kg. The study involved 12 steers and 12 heifers which
each received a single 5.0 mg/kg dose of C-14-oxfendazole by stomach
tube. The animals were sacrificed in groups of six (three steers and three

The extraction of liver samples in the studies summarized above revealed that
liver contained a significant amount of nonextractable residue and that the
relative proportion of that residue increased with the length of time post
dosing. At three days post dosing, 24&#37; of the total radioactivity was
nonextractable with ethyl acetate. That percentage increased to 77&#37; at seven
days and to about 94&#37; by days 14 and 21.<p>
The extractable fraction of the radioactivity in liver was subjected to a
procedure involving thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid
chromatography, and mass spectrometry. This resulted in the isolation and
identification of
parent oxfendazole and its thioether (febendazole) and sulfone metabolites.
The percentages of the metabolites in the extractable fractions at three days
and at seven days post dosing are shown below. The chromatography also showed
that a small amount of more polar metabolite fraction was present, but its
components were not identified.<p>

The metabolite pattern of oxfendazole was also studied in the plasma and liver
of rats at sacrifice intervals from one-half hour to 24 hours post dosing with
a 6 mg/kg dose of C-14-oxfendazole. Extraction with ethyl acetate or
chloroform, followed by thin layer chromatography of the extract, demonstrated
that the extractable radioactivity in rat plasma and liver consisted
predominantly of oxfendazole and its thioether and sulfone metabolites. The
quantitative distribution of the three compounds in rat liver was quite similar
to that observed in calf liver.<p>
The metabolite workup showed that nonextractable (bound) residues in rat liver
amounted to about 40&#37; of the total radioactivity at 1 hour post dosing. That
percentage increased to more than 90&#37; by 24 hours post dosing.<p>
A comparison was made of the metabolite patterns presents in cattle liver with
those present in rat liver, and its was concluded that the major identifiable
metabolites were the same in both species. A very similar quantitative
distribution was observed, and an appreciable nonextractable (bound) residue
was shown to be present in the liver of both species. The comparison thus
indicated that the test species was exposed to all of the metabolites shown to
be present in the liver of cattle.<p>
<B>D. Bioavailability of the Cattle Liver Bound Residue and Calculation of the
Total Residue of Human Food Safety Concern</B><p>
A bioavailability study in the rat based on the Gallo Torres model&#42;(Methodology for the Determination of Bioavailability of labeled Residues,"
H.E. Gallo-Torres, <i>Journal of Toxicology and Enviromental Health, 2,</i>
827-845 (1977)) was
conducted with the nonextractable residue  of C-14-oxfendazole
present in cattle liver. This study (87-RT-124/IM) established the relative
bioavailability of the cattle liver bound residue compared with the
bioavailability of the parent drug and allowed a portion of the bound residue
in cattle liver to be discounted from human food safety concern. The
investigation yielded bioavailability values of 8.8&#37; for the bound residue in
cattle liver and of 69.8&#37; for C-14 oxfendazole. This yielded a
relative bioavailability of 13&#37;.<p>

</pre>
The results of the bioavailability study and the residue data in studies
77-CA-29 and 78-CA-18 (Section C) were used to calculate values for a decline
curve of the total C-14-oxfendazole residue in liver after the
discount of a portion of the bound residue. That curve represents the total
residues that are of human food safety concern, and it allows the calculation
of a tolerance as explained in Section E.<p>
Values for the decline curve were obtained by a procedure which used 23&#37; and
77&#37; as the percentages of extractable and nonextractable total residue in
cattle liver at seven days and longer post dosing. The values for the decline
curve were calculated as shown below by adding the extractable residue (23&#37; of
the total residue at each time point) and the portion of bound residue that is
of concern (13&#37; of 77&#37; of the total residue) at each time point.<p>

</pre>
<B>E. Target Tissue, Marker Residue, Tolerance and Rm Assignments</B> <p>
The data reported in total residue studies 77-CA-29 and 78-CA-18 (Section C)
established that liver contains the highest levels of total residues of
oxfendazole and that it is the tissue in cattle from which residues are slowest
to deplete to the safe concentration. The fact that total residues in liver
were generally eight to tenfold higher than in other tissues strongly suggested
liver as the choice for the target tissue.<p>
The metabolism data described earlier confirmed liver as the target tissue and
revealed that there were two candidate marker substances for oxfendazole in
liver. One choice was the combined residues of oxfendazole and its two
metabolites (its thioether and sulfone), and the other choice was fenbendazole
(the thioether metabolite).<p>
Two things complicated the selection of a marker residue for oxfendazole. The
first was the fact the fenbendazole already is a regulated drug in cattle and
serves as its own marker (21 CFR 556.275). The second is the fact that
fenbendazole and oxfendazole are very closely related structurally with
oxfendazole simply being the sulfoxide of fenbendazole. Both compounds are
rapidly metabolized in cattle to a common pool of metabolites that consists of
fenbendazole, its sulfoxide (oxfendazole) and its sulfone. Evidence for this
exists in the published literature (For a leading reference see "Pharmacokinetics
of Fenbendazole and Oxfendazole in Cattle," A.J. Ngomuo, S.E. Marriner, and J.A.
Bogan, <I>Veterinary Research Communications </I>, 8, 187-193 (1984)) and in a
residue comparison study conducted in the course of data collection for this
NADA.<p>

The studies demonstrating the common pool of metabolites showed that the
quantitative relationship of the three metabolites was so close that cattle
treated with oxfendazole cannot be distinguished from cattle treated with
fenbendazole on the basis of the residues present in their edible tissues.
This suggested two things. The first was that fenbendazole should be the
marker because the residue pattern of oxfendazole is the same in cattle as that
for fenbendazole and the latter drug is currently regulated with fenbendazole
as its marker. The second was that it would be necessary to confirm that the
0.8 ppm tolerance established under 21 CFR 556.275 is also a valid tolerance for
fenbendazole as the marker for oxfendazole, if it were to be used as the marker
residue.<p>
Fenbendazole was the final choice between the two candidate marker substances,
and the steps used to arrive at that choice are described below.<p>
Prior to the approval of fenbendazole as an anthelmintic drug in cattle, the
combined metabolites of oxfendazole were the marker substance being developed
for oxfendazole. Because the total residue studies that support this NADA were
conducted at that time, combined metabolites were measured as the marker in
that work. Values for the combined metabolite marker were reported in total
residue study 78-CA-18, which is described in Section C. The measurements were
made by an HPLC assay of liver, and the assay included an oxidation step to
convert oxfendazole and the fenbendazole metabolite to the sulfone which was the
entity actually measured. The levels of the combined metabolites reported for
liver tissue are shown below.<p>

</pre>
The graphical representation of these data along with the total residue values
of human food safety concern allowed the calculation of a tolerance for
oxfendazole based on the combined metabolite marker. Using the value of 1.7
ppm as the safe concentration in cattle liver, this procedure yielded a
tolerance of 1.0 ppm. That value is the level of the combined metabolite
marker expected to be in liver tissue when the oxfendazole total residue of
concern in that tissue has depleted to the safe concentration of 1.7 ppm.<p>
The two candidate marker substances and their respective tolerances were
compared to see how equivalent they were in terms of setting a withdrawal time
for oxfendazole. This was believed to be the only practical test for comparing
the two, and it was done with the data in withdrawal study IAS 1134-952
described in Section G. That study contained residue values in liver for
oxfendazole as well as for fenbendazole and the sulfone. This allowed
withdrawal times based on fenbendazole and on the sum of the three metabolites
to be calculated days from the same data set. The results were a withdrawal
time of seven days for the fenbendazole marker with its 0.8 ppm tolerance.
Seven days was also the withdrawal time calculated for the combined metabolite
marker substances and its 1.0 ppm tolerance. This served to show that the two
marker substances and tolerances were equivalent in terms of the regulatory
withdrawal time. Once this was done, fenbendazole was assigned as the marker
residue with 0.8 ppm as the Rm (tolerance). That choice allows a single common
marker to serve for the group of benzimidazole anthelmintics that yield the
same common pool of metabolites in the tissues of cattle.<p>
<B>F. Regulatory methods</B><p>
The determinative and confirmatory methods that serve to regulate residues of
oxfendazole by its marker residue, fenbendazole, are the official methods for
fenbendazole. Those methods are filed in the Food Additives Analytical Manual
on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600
Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857.<p>
<B>G. Withdrawal Time</B><p>
A withdrawal time for the 22.5&#37; and 9.06&#37; oxfendazole suspensions was
calculated from the residue data in study IAS 1134-952. That investigation
involved a total of 20 steers and heifers, and each animal received a single
4.5 mg/kg intraruminal dose of the 22.5&#37; oxfendazole suspension. A Synanthic
Tru-Fire Injector was used to inject the dose. The animals were killed in
groups of four (two steers and two heifers) at 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 days post
dosing. Liver samples were collected from each of the animals, and the assays
were performed with a method developed by Syntex. The assay (BMS method 87005)
which was based on high performance liquid chromatography individually
quantitated oxfendazole, fenbendazole and the sulfone at levels to 0.005 ppm.
The levels of the combined metabolites were obtained by adding the values for
oxfendazole and its two metabolites. The assay results are shown below.<p>

In order to obtain a withdrawal time from the residue data listed above, 99&#37;
tolerance limits (95&#37; confidence) were calculated in two statistical analyses.
The first of these considered the combined metabolites as the marker substance
with its tolerance of 1.0 ppm as calculated in Section E. The second analysis
used fenbendazole as the marker with its 0.8 ppm tolerance. Both analyses
yielded seven days as the time required for the upper tolerance limit to fall
below the tolerance.<p>
Seven days was assigned as the withdrawal period for the intraruminally
administered 22.5&#37; suspension as well as for the 22.5&#37; suspension administered
as a drench and for the 9.06&#37; suspension administered as a drench. The latter
two treatments were considered an alternate dosing scheme and an alternate
formulation of the intraruminal treatment investigated in residue study IAS
1134-952. The differences they represented were considered unlikely to alter
the concentration of oxfendazole residues in liver to the extent that the
withdrawal time would be changed. This assumption was supported by results
from a bioequivalence study. As a result, separate withdrawal studies were not
required for the oral dosing with the 22.5&#37; suspension or for the 9.06&#37;
suspension.<p>

<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and with 21 CFR 514 of the
implementing regulations. The data demonstrate that oxfendazole "Synanthic&#174;"
9.06&#37; and 22.5&#37; suspension when used under the labeled conditions of use are
safe and effective.<p>
A tolerance is established for total oxfendazole residues in edible cattle
tissues based on a marker residue concentration of 0.8 ppm fenbendazole in the
target tissue liver. A fenbendazole concentration of 0.8 ppm in liver
corresponds to a total safe concentration of oxfendazole residue of 0.84 ppm in
muscle, 1.7 ppm in liver, 2.5 ppm in kidney, and 3.3 ppm in fat. Oxfendazole
and fenbendazole are benzimidazole anthelmintics with an identical metabolite
pattern. Fenbendazole is a major metabolite of both drugs.<p>
The agency has granted an exemption under 21 CFR 201.105 from the requirement of
"adequate directions for use" in section 520(f)(1) of the act for the
oxfendazole "Synanthic&#174;" 22.5&#37; suspension for oral or intraruminal
administration. Therefore, labeling will restrict this drug to use by or on
the order of a licensed veterinarian. This decision was based on the following
factors: (a) the intraruminal route needs prior training before it can be used,
(b) the intraruminal route of administration is the first for this anthelmintic
product to be approved in the U.S.A., and (c) because of (a) and (b) adequate
direction for over-the-counter use of the drug for its labeled route of
administration could not be prepared at this time. However, because of the
drug's route of administration, conditions to be treated, and the ability of a
layperson to determine these conditions, the agency has concluded that
oxfendazole "Synanthic&#174;" 9.06&#37; suspension labeling for oral use contains
adequate directions for use by layperson and, thus, the drug may be marketed
over-the-counter.<p>
Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the act provides a three year period of exclusivity
to NADAs for previously approved active ingredient because of report of new
clinical trial, field investigation, and human food safety studies were
required for approval.<p>

<B>II. Indications for Use </b><p>
For the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by <i>Eimeria
acervulina, E. tenella, E. maxima, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati</i>&#160; and as an aid in
the reduction of mortality due to <i>E. coli</i>&#160; infections susceptible to such
treatment.<p>
<B>III. Dosage Form </b><p>
Finished feeds manufactured from: <p>
<B>BIO-COX</B> <br> Supplied as a medicated premix in 50 pound bags.  Each pound of premix
contains 30 mg of salinomycin sodium activity.<p>
<B>AUREOMYCIN 50, 70, and 100 Granular Type A medicated articles</B><br> Contains
chlortetracycline calcium complex equivalent to 50, 70, and 100 grams of
chlortetracycline HCl per pound of premix.<p>

<B>Route of Administration:</B> Oral administration <i>via</i>&#160; the feed.<p>
<B>Recommended Dosage </B><p> Salinomycin sodium (from BIO-COX) at concentrations ranging
from 0.0044% to 0.0066% (40 to 60 g/ton) in finished feed.  Chlortetracycline
(from AUREOMYCIN) at a concentration of 0.055% (500 g/ton) in finished feed.<p>
<B>IV. Effectiveness </B><p>
The approved original NADA 128-686 for BIO-COX (salinomycin sodium) contained
adequate data to establish that salinomycin sodium at a range of 0.0044% to
0.0066% (40 to 60 g/ton) in finished feed is safe and effective for the
prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria acervulina, E. tenella, E.
brunetti, E. maxima, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati </i>.<p>

The approved original NADA 48-761 for AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline
(32 FR 14155; 10/12/67) contained adequate data to establish that,  

at concentrations of
500 g/ton of feed,  the drug is safe and effective 
as an  aid  in the reduction of mortality due to<i> E. coli</i>&#160; infections susceptible
to such treatment.<p>

Data supplied in this submission demonstrate that the combination
of  salinomycin sodium at concentrations of 0.0044% to
0.0083% (40 to 75 g/ton) + at a
concentration of 0.055% (500 g/ton) is effective for the prevention of 
 coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by <i>E. necatrix, E.
acervulina, E. tenella, E. maxima, E. brunetti</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati </i>, and as an aid in
the reduction of mortality due to <i>E. coli</i>&#160; infections susceptible to such
treatment.<p>
<B>A. Non Interference in Battery Studies</B><p>
<B>Experiment A-86-21 <i>E. coli</i>&#160; Challenge Study</B><p>
Four hundred Hubbard X Hubbard broiler chickens at nine days of age were used
in an adequate, well-controlled battery study.  The
study was conducted in a uniform environment with a 12 hour light-dark cycle to
test for noninterference of BIO-COX salinomycin with the antibacterial efficacy of
AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline.<p>
This study was conducted by using the recommended use level of
chlortetracycline (500 g/ton).  The experimental treatment groups were as
follows: uninfected nonmedicated control, infected nonmedicated control,
infected chlortetracycline at 500 g/ton (550 ppm), infected salinomycin  at 75g/ton (82.5
ppm) and infected chlortetracycline at 500 g/ton (550 ppm) with salinomycin 75g/ton (82.5
ppm).<p>
There were four replicate pens per treatment and each pen contained five males
and five females.  At 3 hours post-treatment initiation the nine-day-old-birds 
were challenged by injection in the right thoracic air-sac with a culture
containing approximately 1.4 X 10-4 cfu per dose of chlortetracycline sensitive
<i>E. coli </i>.  Noninfected control birds were injected similarly with sterile
phosphate buffered saline.  The birds were medicated for 5 days and a 7-day
withdrawal period ensued.  Feed consumption and mortality were recorded daily
for each pen.  Birds were weighed at 5 and 12 days post challenge.  Results
are in Table 1.  Survivors were sacrificed 12 and 13 days post challenge. At
necropsy, all birds were assigned air sac lesion scores.  Air sac swabs were
cultured in attempts to recover the challenge <i>E. coli</i>.<p>

The results presented in Table 2 show that chlortetracycline incorporated in
the diet at 550 ppm (500 g/ton) prevented development of <i>E. coli </i>&#160; induced air
sac infection in chickens challenged with <i>E. coli </i>.  BIO-COX
salinomycin in combination with chlortetracycline did not interfere with the
antibacterial efficacy of chlortetracycline in broilers.<p>

<b>B. Coccidial Challenge Studies</b><p>
Two week old Hubbard X Hubbard broiler chickens were used in adequate, well-controlled 
battery studies.  The studies were conducted in a uniform
environment with continuous artificial illumination to test for noninterference 
of AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline with the anticoccidial
effectiveness of BIO-COX salinomycin.  Recent field strain isolates collected
from various broiler producing regions of the United States were used.  For
each study, combinations of <i>E. acervulina/E. mivati, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E.
brunetti</i>&#160; or <i>E. acervulina, E. maxima</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; 
were used.  Combinations of
three challenge species in each study were used to differentiate areas of the
intestines infected by the parasite.<p>
These studies were conducted by using the lowest recommended use level of
salinomycin (40 g/ton).  The experimental treatment groups were as follows:
Group I - noninfected, nonmedicated control; Group II - infected, nonmedicated
control; Group III - infected, salinomycin 40 g/ton; Group IV) infected,
chlortetracycline 500 g/ton; Group V - infected, salinomycin 40 g/ton +
chlortetracycline 500 g/ton.<p>
In each of these studies all pens were preselected, birds were randomized by
weight and assigned to cages with 10 birds/cage, and 4 replicates were used
per treatment group.  Groups were medicated 2 days before infection was
administered.  Evaluations were by lesion scores, (analysis was performed on
preselected birds from each pen), dropping scores, weight gains and feed
conversions.<p>
Salinomycin at 40 g/ton in combination with AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline at
500 g/ton provided better anticoccidial activity than that obtained with either
chlortetracycline alone or unmedicated controls.<p>

<b>V. Animal Safety</b><p>
The original approved NADAs for salinomycin (NADA 128-686) and for
chlortetracycline (NADA 48-761) contained adequate data to establish the safety
of each drug for broiler chickens.<p>
The safety of the 2 drugs when used in combination was demonstrated in the
noninterference battery and coccidial challenge  studies described in this document.  In each 
of the several studies there
was no evidence that drug was the cause of any mortality or toxicity.<p>

Based on the data in the parent NADAs and from 
the noninterference battery and anticoccidial challenge  studies, 
 the combination is safe to be fed to broiler chickens as
indicated on the label.<p>
The data show that  the combination of BIO-COX salinomycin at 40 - 60 g/ton plus 
AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline at 500 g/ton in the feed of broiler
chickens fulfills all the requirements for a
combination drug for animals as follows:<p>
A. Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed effects;<p>
B. The dosages of each drug component are such that the combination is safe and
effective; and<p>
C. The label claims are not antagonistic.<p>
<b>VI. Human Safety</b><p>
<b>A. Data to Support Human Safety</b><p>
The safety of the approved products, salinomycin sodium (BIO-COX) and
chlortetracycline (AUREOMYCIN) has been established by data submitted in their
respective original NADAs, NADA 128-686 and NADA 48-761.<p>

The tolerance for residues of chlortetracycline in edible tissue of chicken is
established at 4.0 ppm in kidney and 1.0 ppm in muscle, liver, fat and skin (21
CFR 556.150).  Safe concentrations of total residues of salinomycin in the
edible tissues of chickens are 0.6 ppm for muscle, 1.8 ppm for liver and 1.2
ppm for skin/fat.  (Safe concentrations refer to the concentrations of total
residues considered safe in edible tissues.)  Total residues are highest in
liver tissue.  Parent drug salinomycin in skin/fat was established as the marker
substance for total residues in liver. An upper limit of 200 ppb (0.2 ppm) for
residues of parent salinomycin in skin/fat is established for uses of
salinomycin with a zero day withdrawal.<p>
<b>B. Residue Depletion/Non Interference Studies</b><p>
Residue data supporting the approved individual uses of salinomycin and
chlortetracycline and their withdrawal times of 0 and 1 day, respectively,
were submitted in their respective original applications (see Part A
above).<p>
Drug residue elimination and assay noninterference studies were conducted to
establish that each drug in the presence of the other does not exceed its
established safe concentration of tolerance, as applicable, at the proposed
withdrawal time and that neither drug interferes in each other's tissue residue
assay.<p>
Control chicken muscle, liver, skin/fat were fortified to contain 2.0 ppm
salinomycin, 2.0 ppm roxarsone and/or 0.50 ppm chlortetracycline.  The analyses
of these samples by the chlortetracycline microbioassay procedure showed
quantitative recovery of chlortetracycline either in the presence or absence of
salinomycin plus roxarsone.<p>
Control skin/fat tissue homogenate were spiked with combinations of salinomcyin
(0.7 ppm) and chlortetracycline (1.0 ppm). Chlortetracycline did not interfere
with the tissue residue assay procedure (HPLC) for salinomycin.<p>
A tissue depletion study was conducted by A.H. Robins Company under protocol
86-0595 at the A.H. Robins Farm in Ashland, VA.  Tissues were obtained from
broiler chickens fed one of the following: 1) unmedicated control diet for 42
days; 2) a diet containing the drug combination of 75 g/ton salinomycin plus 45
g/ton  roxarsone plus 200 g/ton chlortetracycline for the first 37 days, then a
diet containing the drug combination of 75 g/ton of salinomycin plus 45 g/ton
of roxarsone plus 500 g/ton chlortetracycline from Day 37 to 42.  The medicated
group was switched on the morning of Day 42 to unmedicated control diet, and
birds were sacrificed following drug withdrawal periods of 0 to 7 days.

Tissues were collected, and tissue levels of   drug residue determined for the
respective drug as follows: salinomycin at Day 0 post withdrawal,
chlortetracycline on days 0, 3, 5 and 7 days post withdrawal, and
roxarsone at days 0, 3 and 7 post withdrawal.  Tissues from chickens
receiving unmedicated feed during the entire study served as controls with
tissues being collected on day 42 of the study.<p>
The target tissue for residue elimination studies for salinomycin is skin/fat.
Salinomycin assayed at &#60;.1 ppm in skin/fat, which is below the upper limit
of (0.2 ppm) for the marker residue.<p>
At withdrawal days of 0, 3, 5, and 7 all samples assayed for
chlortetracycline residues were well below  1 ppm, the established tolerance.
   Kidney tissue was not assayed, as chicken kidney is no longer
considered to be an edible tissue.<p>
The results of the residue depletion study (Table 5) support the 24 hour
withdrawal for this salinomycin - chlortetracycline combination .<p>

</pre> 
A regulatory analytical method for salinomycin is not required.  A practical
analytical method for the determination of tissue residues of chlortetracycline is
available in the Food Additives Analytical Manual on display in FDAs Freedom of
Information Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857).<p>
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and demonstrate that the combination of salinomycin sodium  
 at
concentrations of 40 to 60 g/ton (0.0044 to 0.0066%) + chlortetracycline at 
500 g/ton (0.055%) in   finished feed for broilers is safe and effective for the indications stated
on  the product labeling.<p>

The tolerances for residue of chlortetracycline in edible tissue of chicken are
established at 4.0 ppm in kidney and 1 ppm in uncooked muscle, liver, fat and
skin (21 CFR 556.150). 
Safe concentrations of total residue of salinomcyin in edible tissues of
chickens are 0.6 ppm for muscle, 1.8 ppm for liver and 1.2
ppm for skin/fat.  The data submitted in support of the NADA indicated that the residues
of chlortetracycline were below the established tolerance in edible tissue and the residues of salinomycin
were below the safe concentration in the edible tissues.<p> 

The 24 hours withdrawal time before slaughter is satisfactory.<p>

Adequate directions for use of the proposed drug combination in broiler
chickens have been written for the requested claims of this NADA.  Products
containing salinomycin and chlortetracycline alone are currently available over-the-counter.<p> 
The Agency has concluded that approval of the
combination (salinomycin + chlortetracycline) will not significantly increase
human exposure to residue in edible tissues.<p>

4. Placebo: OTOMAX formulation vehicle.<P>
<B>d. Treatment Schedule:</B><P>
Otitis externa was induced in twenty-eight dogs using <I>Staphylococcus
aureus</I>&#160;and the yeast, <I>Malassezia pachydermatis</I>. Dogs were
randomly assigned into 4 treatments groups. Treatment began after
induction of acute otitis externa and assignment into groups.Treatments
were given according to the label instruction for TOPAGEN Ointment,
i.e., 4 drops per treatment (for dogs less than 30 pounds), administered
twice a day for 7 days. Following instillation of drug, the ear was
gently massaged to ensure full, even distribution of the drug.<P>
Blinding was accomplished by serially numbering each treatment tube.
Each dog was assigned a single numbered tube immediately prior to the
first treatment. The number code was broken at the conclusion of the
trial.<P>

A. Discomfort <BR>
B. Inflammation (i.e., erythema) <BR>
C. Swelling<BR>
D. Exudate - odor, color, quantity<P>
<B>Microbiological</B><P>
Agar plates containing selective media for bacteria or fungi were
inoculated from ear swabs taken from each dog at each observation point.
Resulting growth was scored for relative amounts of bacteria and or
<I>M. pachydermatis</I>. In addition, ear swabs were used to make a roll
smear which was evaluated for relative numbers of bacteria and <I>M.
pachydermatis</I>&#160;cells.<P>
<B>g. Summary of Results</B><P>
OTOMAX adequately controlled the clinical signs associated with an
induced otitis externa and effectively eliminated both the bacterial and
<I>M. pachydermatis</I>&#160;infections, although there was still
evidence of bacterial and yeast growth on roll smears and in culture.
Significant improvement in clinical signs was seen by the first
post-treatment observation (Day 4). OTOMAX was most effective in
eliminating both bacterial and <I>M. pachydermatis</I> infections. OTOMAX was
not different from TOPAGEN and both were superior to placebo and
clotrimazole in controlling clinical signs and eliminating bacterial
infections.<P>
<B>h. Statistical Analysis:</B><P>
The variables discomfort, swelling, and odor were analyzed by Fisher's
Exact Test. The variables inflammation and quantity of exudates were
analyzed by Ridit Analysis. Cultures from the ears of each dog were
grown on four selective media. Resultant growth was rated. Ridit
analysis was used to analyze the results from each medium. Roll smear
results were ranked for each observation, then analyzed by a
Kruskal-Wallis test.<P>
All of the above analyses were performed separately for each observation
day. Statistical significance was declared at the p&lt;= 0.05 level.<P>
For the clinical observations, no significant differences between groups
were observed on day 1, indicating comparable infections in all four
groups. At the later time points, OTOMAX and TOPAGEN were clinically
superior to the Placebo or Clotrimazole groups. No clinical differences
were seen between OTOMAX and TOPAGEN as both products contain
betamethasone which rapidly controlled signs of inflammation.<P>
For the microbiology culture observations, all groups were comparable on
day 0 and day 1. For the Sabouraud's plate, the OTOMAX group had
significantly lower culture scores than the Placebo and TOPAGEN groups
on day 4 and day 8. At later dates, the OTOMAX group had significantly
lower culture scores than the Placebo and Clotrimazole groups on blood
and mannitol salt plates, but no difference was seen on McConkey
agar.<P>
OTOMAX and Clotrimazole groups had significantly reduced <I>M.
pachydermatis</I> roll smear counts over TOPAGEN and Placebo groups. The
Clotrimazole group, however, did not demonstrate a statistically
significant difference for <I>M. pachydermatis</I>&#160;over Placebo
with regard to agar growth scores.<P>
<B>i. Conclusion:</B><P>
It was concluded that OTOMAX was effective in controlling the clinical
signs associated with an induced mixed bacterial and <I>M.
pachydermatis</I>&#160;otitis externa. The safety and compatibility of
the components of OTOMAX was demonstrated. OTOMAX was determined to be
better than Placebo or Topagen for yeast culture scores on days 4 and 8.
OTOMAX and Clotrimazole were determined to be better than Placebo or
Topagen for roll smear results for yeast. However, Clotrimazole was not
determined to be better than Placebo for yeast culture scores. Due to
the ambiguous nature of results regarding the efficacy of the
clotrimazole component, an additional study was required to confirm the
efficacy of 1% clotrimazole (V89-010).<P>
<B>j. Adverse Effects:</B><P>
No adverse effects were observed during this study in any of the dogs
receiving either OTOMAX, TOPAGEN, or Placebo.<P>

<B>Microbiolooical:</B><P>
Amounts of <I>M. pachydermatis</I>&#160;in the affected ear were
monitored and quantitatively scored on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar.<P>
<B>g. Summary of Results:</B><P>
Clotrimazole treated dogs demonstrated a statistically significant
reduction in <I>M. pachyderrnatis</I>&#160;infection levels over placebo
treated dogs on Study Days 3, 5, 7 and 10. By Day 10, the organism was
eliminated in 88% of the dogs receiving clotrimazole while all of the
dogs receiving the placebo remained positive for the organism.<P>
<B>h. Statistical Analysis:</B><P>
Infection levels of <I>M. pachydermaris</I>&#160;and the clinical
parameters of discomfort, swelling, inflammation, exudate quantity and
color were analyzed by the Wilcoxon Midrank Test. Exudate odor was
analyzed by Fisher's Exact Test. Statistical significance was declared
at the p&lt;=0.05 level.<P>
The comparisons of the <I>M. pachydermaris</I>&#160;scores between
Clotrimazole and Placebo groups were not statistically significant on
Day 1 or Day 0. The differences in the <I>M.
pachydermaris</I>&#160;growth scores between the clotrimazole and
placebo groups were statistically significant on all other examination
days (Days 3, 5, 7, and 10).<P>
There was no evidence that the two treatment groups differed with
respect to level of discomfort at any of the scheduled assessments.
Swelling was significantly reduced in the clotrimazole group, over
Placebo, on Days 7 and 10. Inflammation scores were also significantly
improved in the clotrimazole group as compared to Placebo on Day 7.
There was no statistically significant difference with respect to the
quantity or color of exudate at any of the observations. The exudate
odor was significantly less evident in dogs treated with clotrimazole on
Days 5, 7, and 10.<P>
<B>i. Conclusions:</B><P>
Clotrimazole at a concentration of 1% in the OTOMAX vehicle demonstrated
a statistically significant effect over OTOMAX vehicle alone in
elimination of <I>M. pachydermatis</I>&#160;from the ear. Clotrimazole
also exerted a statistically significant effect on exudate odor and
swelling.<P>
<B>j. Adverse Effects:</B><P>
No adverse reactions attributable to treatment were encountered during
the course of the study. Two dogs died during this study - one in the
clotrimazole group and one in the control group. Necropsy and
histopathology revealed no definite cause of death in the dogs; however,
a clinical diagnosis of viral enteritis was made. This was based on an
outbreak of similar signs affecting several animals from both groups, of
which all but two recovered.<P>
Both studies C-6-87 and V89-010 are pivotal in establishing the
component efficacy of OTOMAX. In study C-6-87 the three way combination
of betamethasone valerate, gentamicin sulfate, and clotrimazole was
shown to be superior to either the two way combination of betamethasone
valerate and gentamicin (TOPAGEN) or clotrimazole alone for treatment of
otitis externa in dogs caused by bacteria susceptible to gentamicin
and/or <I>M. pachydermatis</I>. Study V89-010 demonstrated that 1%
clotrimazole was superior to placebo against experimentally induced
<I>Malassezia pachydermatis</I>&#160;(yeast). The combination product is
therefore justified. The TOPAGEN components, betamethasone valerate and
gentamicin sulfate, contribute to the treatment of acute and chronic
canine otitis externa caused by bacteria susceptible to gentamicin. The
clotrimazole 1% component contributes to the treatment of acute and
chronic canine otitis externa associated with <I>M. pachydermatis</I>.<P>

2. Panolog Ointment: commercially available<P>
<B>d. Treatment Schedule:</B><P>
Dogs from each center in the U.S. were randomly assigned into the two
treatment groups. Centers represented three distinct geographic
regions.<P>
A total of 341 dogs of various breeds, ages, weights, and both sexes
were presented for diagnosis and treatment of otitis externa with both
bacterial and <I>M. pachydermatis</I>&#160;infections. There were 58
cases which met the inclusion criteria and these were subsequently
included in this study. Dogs with ear mite infestations were excluded as
well as those receiving concomitant local or systemic antibiotic
therapy. Concomitant therapy for unrelated disorders such as diabetes,
congestive heart failure, etc., was permitted.<P>
Previous treatment and cultural history were obtained wherever possible.
A complete physical and otoscopic examination was made of both ears in
each affected animal included in the study.<P>
Dogs enrolled in the study were assigned to a treatment group, with the
medication dispensed in coded, identically-appearing tubes, according to
a sponsor-generated randomization schedule. To further ensure blinding,
treatment was administered by someone other than the principal
investigator.<P>
Prior to inclusion in the study the ear was swabbed and a roll smear was
made to demonstrate both bacteria and <I>M. pachydermatis</I>&#160;were
present and were believed to be contributing to the otitis externa. A
dog was eligible for inclusion whether one or both ears were affected.
In cases where the infection was bilateral both ears received the same
treatment, but only the right ear was included for evaluation of
treatment.<P>
The first microbiology specimen was collected and clinical evaluation
was made prior to initiation of treatment. The ears were cleaned with an
ear cleansing solution free of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory
activity. Medication was applied twice daily for seven days according to
label instructions:<P>
1. Dogs that weighed 30 lbs. or less received 4 drops per affected
ear.<P>
2. Dogs that weighed more than 30 lbs. received 8 drops per affected
ear.<P>
After treatment the ears were massaged, taking care to distribute the
medication evenly throughout the ear canal.<P>
A second examination was made 2 - 4 days following termination of
treatment at which time the ears were examined clinically and
microbiologically as before.<P>
Cases which did not complete the full 7-day therapeutic regimen and
reexamination were considered dropouts. The dropouts were analyzed as
described in the statistical section.<P>

<B>g. Summary of Results:</B><P>
OTOMAX adequately controlled the clinical signs associated with otitis
externa. In addition, OTOMAX controlled both bacteria and <I>M.
pachydermatis</I>&#160;infections associated with otitis externa. OTOMAX
was safe when applied to dogs' ears for the treatment of otitis
externa.<P>
<B>h. Statistical Analysis:</B><P>
A total of 58 cases qualified for inclusion in the statistical analysis.
Data were pooled across the five investigators supplying qualified
cases.<P>
The continuous variable, weight, was analyzed by Analysis of Variance.
Categorical variables, sex, otitis duration, otitis type, affected ear,
discomfort, swelling, exudate color and odor, otitis resolution and
elimination of <I>M. pachydermatis</I>, were analyzed by Fisher's Exact
Test. Ordered categorical variables, age, inflammation, exudate
quantity, overall evaluations by investigator, owner and microbiologist,
and quantitative assessment of roll smear results, were analyzed by
Wilcoxon Midrank Test. Statistical significance was declared at the p
&lt;=0.05 level.<P>
There were no statistically significant differences between OTOMAX and
Panolog Ointment groups for weight, age, sex, otitis duration, otitis
type, affected ear, discomfort, inflammation, swelling, exudate
quantity, exudate odor, overall evaluation by the investigator,
microbiologist and owner.<P>
OTOMAX and Panolog both reduce the quantity of
<I>Malassezia</I>&#160;spp. found on fungal roll smears.<P>
Culture results showed that Panolog eliminated a significantly greater
number of <I>Staphylococcus</I>&#160;spp. (3 of 3) than OTOMAX.
Otherwise roll smear and culture results were not statistically
different with regard to bacteria.<P>
<B>i. Conclusion:</B><P>
This controlled clinical study demonstrated that OTOMAX, a combination
(clotrimazole-gentamicin-betamethasone) otic product, administered to
dogs as recommended was equivalent, with regard to adverse reactions or
side effects, to the approved product (Panolog Ointment).<P>
OTOMAX significantly reduces the quantity of <I>Malassezia</I>&#160;spp.
observed on roll smears when analyzed statistically. However, OTOMAX has
shown only moderate efficacy towards some gram positive cocci, including
some <I>staphylococcus</I>&#160;species. There were no other statistical
differences between Otomax&#174;; and Panolog with respect to efficacy
against bacteria.<P>
This study showed OTOMAX to be both safe and effective for the treatment
of otitis externa in dogs.<P>
<B>j . Adverse Reactions:</B><P>
A total of 13 cases of 341 dispensed test articles (both OTOMAX and
Panolog Ointment) exhibited adverse reactions (8 for OTOMAX; 5 for
Panolog Ointment). Adverse reactions included redness of pinna and
skin(1), redness and bumps on pinna (1), scratching and snorting(1),
discomfort during cleaning or medication(5) for OTOMAX. Panolog Ointment
adverse reactions included head shaking(1), vomiting after three days of
treatment(1), redness and swelling(1), difficulty in medicating(1) and
increased scratching(1).<P>
Overall, there were few adverse reactions for either treatment. OTOMAX
and Panolog Ointment were considered equivalent in this study, with
regard to safety.<P>

<B>General Design of the Investigation:</B><P>
<B>a. Purpose:</B><P>
Early efficacy studies were discontinued because the performance of the
product was in question. Subsequently, the excipients were changed, and
it was proposed that a formulation change would increase the shelf life
stability of the active ingredients.<P>
The purpose of this study was to determine if differences in excipients
between OTOMAX and Topagen Ointment would affect the efficacy of the
active ingredients.<P>

mg/g<P>
3. Placebo: Mineral Oil formulation without active ingredients.<P>
<B>d. Treatment Schedule:</B><P>
Bacterial otitis externa was induced in twenty-one dogs using <I>S.
aureus</I>&#160;and were randomly assigned into 3 treatment groups.
After infection and assignment of groups treatments commenced.
Treatments were given according to label instructions for TOPAGEN
Ointment.<P>
Blinding was accomplished by coding each formulation. The code was
broken at the conclusion of the trial.<P>

B. Inflammation<BR>
C. Swelling<BR>
D. Exudates - odor, color, quantity<P>
<B>Microbiological</B><P>
Agar plates containing selective media for bacteria or fungi were
inoculated with ear swabs collected at each evaluation point from each
dog. Resulting growth was scored according to the amount of bacteria
and/or <I>M. pachydermatis present</I>.<P>
<B>g. Summary of Results:</B><P>
TOPAGEN and TOPAGEN Mineral Oil adequately controlled clinical signs
associated with the induced otitis externa and effectively eliminated
the bacterial infection. Topagen and Topagen Mineral Oil were not
statistically different from each other but were statistically superior
to placebo.<P>
<B>h. Statistical Analysis:</B><P>
The variables discomfort, swelling and odor were analyzed by Fisher's
Exact Test. The variables inflammation and quantity of exudate were
analyzed by Ridit Analysis. Ridit analysis was used to analyze the
culture scores for each selective medium. All of the above was performed
separately for each observation day.<P>
For the clinical observations, no significant differences between groups
were observed on day 1, indicating comparable infections in all three
groups. At the majority of the later dates, the TOPAGEN Mineral Oil
group was significantly better than the Placebo group, and not
significantly different than the TOPAGEN group.<P>
For the microbiology culture observations, all groups were comparable on
day 0 and day 1. No differences between the TOPAGEN Mineral Oil group
and the TOPAGEN group were detected on any of the four media.<P>
<B>i. Conclusion:</B><P>
TOPAGEN and TOPAGEN Mineral Oil were both effective in controlling the
clinical signs associated with an induced bacterial otitis externa as
well as eliminating the associated bacterial infection. There was no
significant difference in either clinical or bacteriological parameters
between the TOPAGEN and TOPAGEN Mineral Oil formulations. Treatment with
TOPAGEN and TOPAGEN Mineral Oil was both safe and effective.<P>
<B>j. Adverse Effects:</B><P>
No adverse effects were observed during this trial in any animal
receiving TOPAGEN, TOPAGEN Mineral Oil or Placebo.<P>
<B>Corroborative Efficacy Study</B><P>
Data from thirty-six dogs initially presented for enrollment in the
Positive Controlled Clinical Evaluation study (V87-008), but who failed
to meet specific entrance requirements were analyzed separately to
support the efficacy of OTOMAX against <I>Malassezia</I>&#160;spp. Refer
to page 6 of this Freedom of Information summary for information on the
parent study. These cases had a <I>Malassezia</I>&#160;spp. infection
and no bacterial infection, as confirmed by roll smear. Evaluation of
the thirty-six cases indicated that OTOMAX and Panolog were equivalent
in reducing <I>Malassezia</I>&#160;spp. and controlling clinical
signs.<P>

<B>Results</B><P>
<B>a. Overt Toxicity</B><P>
Elevated rectal temperatures (equal to or greater than 103 degrees F)
were seen in all groups (except 1X) prior to treatment and early in
therapy. Infection of the penile sheath (as indicated by a purulent
discharge) was seen with similar frequency in all groups. Difficulties
in catheterization were experienced with 1X males. Ocular discharge was
limited to the placebo and 3X groups. Untreated controls and
placebo-treated dogs had higher edema scores. Emesis was seen only in 5X
dogs after 5-6 days of treatment.<P>
<B>b. Hematology</B><P>
A generalized leukocytosis (range of means from 20.4 thousand/cmm in the
1X group to 24.8 thousand/cmm in the 3X group) was seen in all groups
prior to treatment but post induction of infection. Periodic elevations
in band cells were seen in all groups with the highest peaks noted in
animals in the 3X and 5X groups.<P>
<B>c. Serum Chemistry</B><P>
Frequent sporadic elevations in GGT ranging from 9 to 30 units/L (normal
is less than 8 units/L) were noted in all groups pre and post treatment.
There were generalized increases in albumin values post treatment for
the (1X, 3X, and 5X), although the values remained within the normal
range. There were sporadic increases in alkaline phosphatase values up
to 64 IU/L (placebo and 5X). However, all values had returned to the
normal range by the end of the study. Elevations of Lactate
Dehydrogenase (LDH) up to 429 IU/L (normal was less than 293 IU/L) were
noted post infection. Increased values (up to 845 IU/L) persisted in all
groups throughout the study, although values had returned to the normal
range at the study conclusion. The 1 X group consistently had the
highest values (6 of 12 sample means were above the normal range). There
were isolated incidents of potassium values above normal (5.5-6.1
mmol/L), but the means were within the normal range. There were
generalized increases in triglyceride levels in the placebo, 1X, 3X, and
5X groups. The untreated control group did not show such a trend towards
increasing values. All mean triglyceride values were within the normal
range.<P>
<B>d. Urinalysis</B><P>
Composite urinalysis results were within the normal range. There were
rare isolated incidents of findings outside the normal range, including
hematuria (2+ Red blood cells), which could be attributed to
catheterization.<P>
<B>e. Urine Sediment</B><P>
No trends were noted. The sediment results were within the normal range,
with the exception of isolated incidents of elevated red blood cells
(30-70/HPF) and elevated white blood cells (10-30/HPF).<P>
<B>f. Fecal Blood</B><P>
Occult blood was a frequent finding in all treatment groups.<P>
<B>g. Body Weight</B><P>
All animals in the study maintained their weight.<P>
<B>Statistical Analysis:</B><P>
Parameters were evaluated for biological and toxicological rather than
statistical significance.<P>
<B>Conclusions</B><P>
Most overt and all hematological changes appeared to be directly or
indirectly related to the infection model used. Variations in serum
chemistry were either within normal range or isolated incidents. All
values were within the normal range at the conclusion of the study.
Therefore, none of these changes were considered to be toxicologically
significant.<P>
Treatment related changes were limited to a lower edema score in treated
vs. untreated control and placebo groups and emesis at 5X after 5-6 days
of treatment. Both are typical responses to steroid therapy.<P>
In conclusion, OTOMAX administered otically, even at 1, 3, and 5X doses
and for prolonged therapy, is well tolerated by the target species.<P>
<B>6. Human Safety</B><P>
Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:<P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in
food, were not required for approval of this NADA. This product is
labeled as a prescription drug for use only in dogs, which are non-food
animals.<P>
Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling, and Administration:<P>
There is a bolded statement on the front panel of all labeling
components "Keep out of reach of children."<P>
<B>7. Agency Conclusions</B><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements
of section 512 of the Act and section 514.111 of the regulations. It
demonstrates that Otomax&#174; (betamethasone valerate, gentamicin
sulfate, and clotrimazole), when used under labelled conditions of use,
is safe and effective.<P>
This product qualifies for a period of three years of marketing
exclusivity under section 512 (c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act.<P>
Betamethasone, gentamicin, and clotrimazole are previously approved
drugs for use in dogs. This NADA provides for a two-way combination
(betamethasone/gentamicin and clotrimazole) of the approved drugs. It
qualifies for a three year period of marketing exclusivity because new
clinical and field investigations were required for approval of this
drug in combination and were conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<P>
This drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed
veterinarian because professional expertise is required to determine the
existence of and microbiological components of otitis externa.
Additionally, veterinary expertise is needed to ensure that the tympanic
membrane is intact prior to initial administration of the drug.<P>
<B>GUIDELINE FOR DRUG COMBINATIONS FOR USE IN ANIMALS</B><P>
Each of the drug components in this combination is approved
individually. One approved two-way combination consists of betamethasone
and gentamicin, Topagen&#174; Ointment. The other component,
clotrimazole, is approved for use in the treatment of yeast infections
in humans. It is also approved as Veltrim&#174; for topical use in the
treatment of the fungal infections caused by <I>Microsporum
canis</I>&#160;and <I>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</I>&#160;in dogs and
cats. Safety and efficacy information is available on each component of
this combination. The Guideline for Drug Combinations is generally
applied to new drug combinations. The Guideline states that the
combination of the drugs provides a benefit that cannot be obtained by
the use of each of the drugs individually (i.e., each drug has made a
contribution). A 2-way combination must be better than each of the
components. It is prudent to state that the effect of betamethasone will
mitigate clinical signs of inflammation both singularly and in
combination with no antibacterial or antifungal effect. This New Animal
Drug Application satisfies the drug combination policy because the
sponsor has provided evidence that the combination product is superior
to each component (gentamicin/betamethasone and clotrimazole) of the
combination. The betamethasone reduces clinical signs of inflammation;
the gentamicin reduces susceptible bacterial growth, and clotrimazole
reduces <I>Malassezia</I>&#160;spp. growth. Both bacteria and
<I>Malassezia</I>&#160;spp. can be components of otitis externa in the
dog.<P>

<b>5.   Safety:</b><p>
Extensive studies were conducted to establish the safety of apramycin in 
swine.  These included acute and subacute toxicity studies in which the 
drug was shown to have a five-times margin of safety when administered as labeled.<p>
In acute oral toxicity studies single doses of 500 mg/kg,

 800 mg/kg, and 1250 mg/kg were administered
to pigs by gavage.  There were no treatment-related deaths, therefore, the LD1
is greater than 1250 mg/kg (50 x use level) of body weight.no treatment-related
deaths, therefore, the LD1 is greater than 1250 mg/kg (50 x use level) of body
weight.<p>
Intramuscular administration of 1000 mg/kg body weight to pigs resulted only in
transient pain and lameness of 48 hour duration.<p>
Twenty-eight-day subacute toxicity studies at 1, 3, and 5 x the recommended
dosage produced no signs of adverse effects.  There were no treatment-related
changes in organ weights, hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis nor were
any gross or histopathological lesions observed.<p>
Swine fed 100 grams apramycin per ton of feed for 5 weeks showed no more signs
of gastrointestinal irritation than control pigs receiving an apramycin-free
ration.<p>
Pigs were fed apramycin at 100 grams per ton of feed for eight weeks.  A
conditioned avoidance response test system (sound-shock) was used to determine
auditory responses.  It was found that apramycin treated swine responded as
well as unmedicated controls.<p>
Studies were conducted to determine the effect of oral doses of apramycin
sulfate upon the fecal consistency of baby pigs.  Dosages of 50 mg to 200 mg
resulted in less firm stools for a day or two following treatment but caused
no adverse effect upon the gain or survival of the pigs.  This was the only
sign of possible toxicity detected in swine.<p>
The administration of apramycin (2 g of activity per gallon, 0.53 g/liter) via
drinking water to sows of proven parity for seven-day periods at breeding,
early gestation (days 21-28 after breeding), and early lactation (parturition
to 7 days), was without adverse effect on conception rate, litter size, litter
gain during nursing, and survival rate of pigs to weaning.  Likewise, the
administration of the same concentration of apramycin to the boar prior to and
during breeding was without adverse effect on conception rate and litter
size.<p>
<b>6.  Human Safety</b><p>
Fifteen <i>in vivo</i>&#160; toxicity studies were conducted involving mice, rats, rabbits,
guinea pigs, chickens, and dogs treated with graded levels of apramycin.<p>
Acute toxicity tests were conducted in mice, rats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs,
and chickens.<p><b>  The results of oral toxicity tests are shown in the following
table:</b><p>

No sex differences were noted in any of the acute oral toxicity studies. The
only sign of toxicity in dogs given an oral dose of 1,000 mg/kg was mild
diarrhea and vomiting in two (2) of four (4) males and one (1) of four (4)
females.<p>
In the rabbit, signs of toxicity during the first week of observation included
anorexia, weight loss, and some hypoactivity.  The rabbits appeared normal
during the second week.<p>
Signs of toxicity in guinea pigs included anorexia in both sexes; alopecia and
distended abdomens in females.  A reduction in weight gain was evident for both
male and female animals given high doses of apramycin.  Delayed deaths occurred
in one (1) of five (5) male and one (1) of five (5) female guinea pigs given
1250 mg activity/kg.  Of the remaining eight (8) animals in this dose group,
five (5) were found to have mild renal injury at necropsy.<p>

</pre>
All mortalities occurred within 30 minutes in mice and with one 
    exception, within one hour in the rat.  The deaths appeared to be due to CNS
toxicity.<p>
Two (2) of ten (10) mice surviving an intravenous dose of 620 mg/kg showed
enlarged kidneys upon gross examination.  Microscopic examination of kidneys
from rats surviving an intravenous dose of 1800 mg/kg revealed varying degrees
of nephrosis in four (4) animals.<p>
Dermal application of 2000 mg/kg (1040 mg activity/kg) of apramycin to either
intact or abraded rabbit skin caused no mortality during a 14-day observation
period.  Instillation of 36 mg (19 mg activity) of apramycin into the rabbit
eye caused slight reversible conjunctival. redness in two (2) of six (6)
animals.  Attempts to sensitize the guinea pig by applying 29.2 mg apramycin
activity 3 times a week for 3 weeks and challenging 2 weeks later were
negative.<p>
In pilot toxicity studies all rats maintained on diets containing 0.05, 0.1, or
0.2&#37; apramycin activity, equivalent to doses up to 191 mg activity/kg body
weight/day for males and 193 mg activity/kg/day for females, survived a 14-day
study.  No significant changes in growth, efficiency of food utilization or
clinical chemical parameters were observed.  No treatment related
histopathological changes were observed in the kidney.<p>
    Apramycin was administered orally to dogs at 250,  
    1250 or 1600 mg activity/kg/day for 14 days without  
    mortality.  Anorexia accompanied by weight loss was  
    observed in all dogs, and vomiting and dark feces  
    occurred in animals given the highest doses.  Nephrosis  
    was found in all animals with the severity varying  
    from very mild at 250 mg/kg to moderate or severe for  
    the highest dose groups.<p>
    
    In order to test ototoxicity potential, apramycin was-administered 
    subcutaneously to cats at a dose of  
    100 mg/kg/day for 30 days.  Only one (1) of four (4)  
    cats completed the study.  Anorexia and weight loss  
    were apparent in all animals.  Righting reflex and  
    post-rotatory nystagmus time were unaffected by  
    apramycin treatment in three (3) of four  (4) cats.   In  
    the other cat, righting reflex was normal but post-rotatory 
    nystagmus time declined slowly (from 23 to 17  
    seconds) during the first 22 days and rapidly to 9  
    seconds on day 25, the day the animal was killed.  
    Extreme elevations in clinical chemistry parameters  
    were noted in this same animal.   Severe nephrosis-was 
    found at necropsy in three(3) of three (3) cats.<p>
    In subacute toxicity studies, rats were maintained  
    for 3 months on diets containing 200, 400 or 1000 ppm  
    of apramycin sulfate (104, 208 or 520 ppm apramycin  
    activity) or were allowed to consume a 1&#37; w/v (0.52&#37;   
    w/v as activity) solution of apramycin sulfate as   
    their only source of liquid.  Average daily doses of  
    50.4 mg/kg (26.2 mg activity/kg) and 62.7 mg/kg  
    (32.6 mg activity/kg) were consumed by the male and  
    female rats maintained on the 1000 ppm diets.  Male  
    and female rats drinking the 1&#37; solution consumed a  
    daily average of 1040 mg/kg (547 mg activity/kg) and  
    1359 mg/kg (707 mg activity/kg), respectively.  All  
    rats survived with mild diarrhea as the only observable  
    effect.  No apramycin-related effects on body weight  
    gain, efficiency of food utilization, hematology,  
    clinical chemistry or relative organ weight parameters  
    were noted in this study.   Histopathologic examination.  
    of tissues did not reveal any lesions related to apramycin  
    treatment.<p>
Daily oral doses of 5, 10, or 25 mg/kg for 3 months in dogs produced no changes
in body weight, behavior and appearance, or hematology, urinalysis, and
clinical chemistry parameters.  Variations in relative organ weight data were
not considered related to apramycin administration.  No treatment-related gross
or histopathologic lesions were observed.<p>
Many other tests indicate apramycin has no adverse effect upon the
environment.<p>
Nitrogen fixing organisms, including <i>Azotobacter chroococcum, Anabaena flos
aquae ,</i>&#160; and <i>Rhizobium species ,</i>&#160; were tested for their
 susceptibility to apramycin
in broth culture.  Generally the inhibitory concentration for <i>A. chroococcum,
A. flos aquae ,</i>&#160; and <i>R. leguminosarum</i>&#160; was 0.1 ppm. 
<i> R. japonicum</i>&#160; inhibition by
the antibiotic varied with strains between 1 and 10 ppm.<p>
When incorporated to depths of 4 and 9 inches in soil, apramycin at application
rates of 480 lbs/A (160 ppm) and below, caused no statistically significant
inhibition of nodulation or acetylene reduction (nitrogenase) activity in
soybean fields.  The high apramycin rate in the 9 inch incorporation study did
show a 24.8&#37; reduction in mean nodule weight.  However, a wide range of plant
to plant variation in nodule development and size is expected.  In this case,
one of the replicates from the high treatment produced 23&#37; more nodules than
the control average.  The second highest rate, 120 lb/A (40 ppm) also showed a
decrease from controls which was statistically 
    insignificant.  The coefficient of variation was above 40&#37; in 5 of 6
treatments and above 60&#37; in half the treatments.<p>
Apramycin had little effect on sewage-digesting organisms as determined by
standard methods for examining waste water.  Using a laboratory scale,
semicontinuous aerated sewage system, apramycin was tested at an initial
concentration of 0.1 ppm and gradually increased to 102.4 ppm.  In 26 days
changes that occurred in the biochemical oxygen demand, bacterial populations,
pH and solid's content of treated systems also occurred in the negative
controls.  Apramycin was not detrimental to the digestive process.<p>
Tissue residue studies were adequate to demonstrate that residues of apramycin
in edible tissues of treated animals will be below the corresponding tolerances
following the 28-day withdrawal period provided in the labeling.<p>
Tolerances of 0.1 part per million (ppm) are established for total residues of
apramycin in uncooked swine muscle, 0.3 ppm for liver, and 0.4 ppm for kidney
and fat.  A drug residue assay measuring parent apramycin (the marker residue)
in the target tissue, kidney, serves to monitor the total residue in edible
tissues.  A marker residue concentration of 0.1 ppm in kidney corresponds to
0.4 ppm total residue in this target tissue.<p>
The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is filed
in the Food Additive's analytical manual on display in the Dockets Management
Branch, Room 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20852.<p>

Based on toxicological studies including mutagenicity assays and because the
structure of apramycin did not provide any reason for suspicion of
carcinogenicity, apramycin has been assigned to category "A" (low-risk
toxicity) under current Threshold Assessment procedures.  Consequently, 
apramycin was not required to enter the stepwise data collection 
procedures of the  "Chemical Compounds in Food Producing Animals" proposal (44
FR 17070-17114, March 20, 1979).<p>
<b>7.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
&#167; 512 of the Act and demonstrate that APRALAN&#174; Soluble Powder,
when used 
    under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the oral
treatment of porcine colibacillosis (weanling pig scours) caused by 
strains of <i>E. coli</i>&#160; sensitive to apramycin.<p>

Marketing  Status:   OTC<p>

Date of Summary:  JAN 29 1993<p>

<B>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE</B><p>

For the treatment of swine dysentery associated with <I>Treponema hyodysenteriae </I>
and swine pneumonia due to <I>Actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae</I> susceptible to  
tiamulin.<p>

<B>3. PRODUCT  INFORMATION</B><p>
A. Dosage Form:  liquid concentrate (12.3% tiamulin hydrogen fumarate)<p>

B. Route of Administration:   oral, via drinking water<p>

C. Recommended Dosage.   For swine dysentery -- 3.5 mg tiamulin per pound body 
weight daily for 5 consecutive days.  For swine pneumonia -- 10.5 mg tiamulin 
per pound body weight daily for 5 consecutive days.<p>

<B>4. EFFECTIVENESS</B><p>
The effectiveness of DENAGARD &#174;  (tiamulin) in the treatment of swine dysentery 
associated with <I>Treponema  hyodysenteriae</I> is discussed in detail in the FOI 
Summary of original NADA 134-644 (DENAGARD &#174;  Soluble Antibiotic). The 
effectiveness of tiamulin in the treatment of swine pneumonia due to 
<I>Actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae</I> is detailed in the FOI Summary for the 
supplement to NADA 134-644 for that use (48 FR 41384, September 15, 1983).<p>

A crossover bioequivalence study using 20 crossbred pigs (10 barrows and
10 gilts) averaging 19 kg body weight was conducted at the Animal Health 
Research Farm of Ricerca, Inc., Montville, Ohio by Dr. J. Szanto.  The pigs 
were equally divided into two groups, each of which received a single dose of 
15 mg tiamulin per kg body weight by stomach tube either as the soluble powder 
or as the liquid concentrate.  Blood samples were  taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 
and 24 hours.   The highest concentrations occurred at 4 hours for both
formulations  (C MAX =  1.26 &#181; g/mL for the soluble powder and 1.40 &#181; g/mL for
the liquid concentrate).  The differences in C MAX were not statistically 
significant.   Likewise, the differences in areas under the curve (AUC) were 
not statistically significant (13.0 versus 11.5 for the liquid concentrate and 
soluble powder,  respectively).  The differences in T MAX, (3.65 versus 2.65), 
although  statistically  significant,  are  not  biologically  significant.<p>

<B>5. ANIMAL  SAFETY</B><p>
The safety of DENAGARD &#174;  (tiamulin) has been demonstrated in safety, efficacy, 
and field trials, which are discussed in the FOI Summaries for  NADA 134-644 
and 139-472 (<B>48 FR 41384</B>, September 15, 1983;  <B>52 FR 26956</B>, July 17, 1987).<p>

In addition to the previously submitted studies with the technical 
(unformulated)  and the water soluble (formulated) drug,  an acceptability 
study using the liquid concentrate form was conducted at the Animal Health 
Research Farm of Ricerca, Inc., Montville, Ohio by Dr. J. Szanto.  Twenty-four 
crossbred barrows and gilts weighing 25 to 34 kg each were medicated via 
drinking water using the liquid concentrate formulation to provide 60, 180, or 
300 ppm tiamulin for 15 consecutive days.  As tiamulin intake via medicated 
drinking water has been shown to be self-limiting (FOI Summary NADA 134-644), 
the highest level tested represents the maximum level pigs voluntarily  
consume  before  significantly  restricting  their  water consumption.   
Average daily drug intakes were 6.6, 20.8 and 38.1 mg/kg body weight, 
respectively.   No significant differences in weight gain or feed and drinking 
water consumption were observed.   There were no signs of toxicity present.   
All 18 medicated pigs were necropsied.   No treatment related gross 
pathological  changes  were  found.<p>

<B>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</B><p>

The Freedom of Information (FOI) Summary for original NADA 134-644, DENAGARD &#174;  
Soluble Antibiotic (tiamulin soluble powder), describes toxicity, total 
residue, and metabolism studies that were done to establish the tolerance for 
tiamulin residues in edible swine tissues.   [A notice of availability of that 
FOI Summary was published in the <B>FEDERAL REGISTER</B> on September 15, 1983 (<B>48 FR 
41384</B>)].   No additional studies of those types were required for approval of  
DENAGARD &#174;  Liquid Concentrate, because the liquid concentrate is intended for 
dissolution in swine drinking water to achieve the same final tiamulin 
concentrations and doses approved for the soluble powder.<p>

Thus, the tolerance established for tiamulin residues in swine remains at 0.4 
part per million (ppm) of 8-<I>alpha</I>-hydroxymutilin  in  liver  (<B>21 CFR 556.738</B>), 
and the regulatory methods remain as described in the Food Additives 
Analytical Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room.<p>

The only human food safety study required for approval of the liquid 
concentrate was a marker residue depletion study to determine the withdrawal 
times for the new formulation.   As noted above, the liquid concentrate
formulation is intended for use at two doses, 3.5 mg tiamulin per pound of 
body weight (mg/lb BW) for treatment of swine dysentery, and 10.5 mg/lb BW for 
treatment of swine pneumonia.   The soluble powder formulation is already 
approved for those same doses and indications.<p>

The approach to determination of withdrawal times for the liquid concentrate 
was that, initially, a single residue depletion study would be done at the 
10.5 mg/lb BW dose.   If the liquid concentrate qualified for the same 
withdrawal time as the soluble powder at that dose, then a separate depletion 
study at the 3.5 mg/lb BW dose would not be required.  The withdrawal time for 
the 3.5 mg/lb BW dose of the soluble powder would be assigned to the 3.5 mg/lb 
BW dose of liquid concentrate.  The rationale is that if it can be 
demonstrated that the tissue residue depletion characteristics are essentially 
the same for the two formulations at the higher dose, then there is no reason 
to believe that this would not also be true at the lower dose.  The withdrawal 
times assigned to the soluble powder formulation are 7 days for the 10.5 mg/lb 
BW dose and 3 days for the 3.5 mg/lb BW dose.<p>

<I>Marker Residue Depletion Study and Calculation of a Withdrawal Time</I><p>

Twenty (20) crossbred, healthy pigs, weighing 58 to 80 pounds (average 69 
pounds) were randomly assigned to five groups, consisting of two gilts and two 
barrows each.  The pigs received the drug product at 10.5 mg tiamulin hydrogen 
fumarate per pound of body weight (23 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days.  The 
liquid concentrate, which in normal use will be diluted and administered in 
drinking water, was given by gavage to ensure that each pig received the 
desired dose.<p>

The pigs were sacrificed by captive bolt stun gun and exsanguination, one 
group each, at withdrawal times of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days.<p>

The livers were removed from the animals and analyzed for the marker residue,  
8-<I>alpha</I>-hydroxymutilin,  using  Fermenta's  alternate  determinative method.   
Both the original and alternate methods are gas chromatography procedures, and 
the alternate method differs from the original in only minor aspects (e.g. a 
megabore GC column was substituted for a packed column, using the same 
silicone liquid phase, and toluene was substituted for benzene).   The 
alternate method has been reviewed and accepted by FDA.<p>

The mean liver residue values, in parts per billion (ppb), and standard 
deviations at each time point are shown below in Table 1.<p>

These residue depletion data were analyzed by a statistical method which 
determines the statistical tolerance limit for the 99th percentile of the 
population with 95% confidence.   The analysis yielded a withdrawal time of 7 
days for the 10.5 mg/lb dose of the liquid concentrate, which is the same 
withdrawal time approved for the soluble powder formulation.   As noted above, 
this result supports assignment of a 3-day withdrawal time to the 3.5 mg/lb 
dose of the liquid concentrate, which is the withdrawal time assigned to the 
3.5 mg/lb dose of the soluble powder.<p>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section 
512 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR Part 514 of the 
implementing regulations.   The data demonstrate that tiamulin liquid 
concentrate is effective against swine dysentery when administered in the 
drinking water for 5 days at a dose of 3.5 mg tiamulin per pound body weight, 
and is effective against swine pneumonia when administered in the drinking 
water for 5 days at a dose of 10.5 mg tiamulin per pound body weight.<p>

A tolerance for the tiamulin marker residue, 8-<I>alpha</I>-hydroxymutilin,  is 
established in swine at 0.4 ppm in liver (<B>21 CFR 556.738</B>).  The presence of 
the marker residue at or below 0.4 ppm in liver will ensure that total 
tiamulin related residues will not exceed the respective safe concentrations 
of 3.6, 10.8, 14.4, and 14.4 ppm in swine muscle, liver, kidney, and fat.<p>

A withdrawal period of 7 days has been assigned for the 10.5 mg/lb dose of the 
DENAGARD &#174;   (tiamulin) liquid concentrate formulation, based on the results of 
a residue depletion study done with the liquid concentrate at that dose.  This 
withdrawal time is the same as is approved for the 10.5 mg/lb dose of the
DENAGARD &#174;  (tiamulin) soluble powder formulation.  The fact that the two 
formulations have the same withdrawal time at the 10.5 mg/lb dose indicates 
that the depletion characteristics of the two formulations are essentially the 
same.  There is no reason to believe that this would not also be true at the 
3.5 mg/lb dose.   Therefore, the 3-day withdrawal time assigned for the 3.5 
mg/lb dose of the soluble powder has also been assigned to the 3.5 mg/lb dose 
of the liquid concentrate.<p>

Labeling directions are adequate to enable laypersons to use this product to 
treat swine dysentery associated with <I>Treponema  hyodysenteriae</I> and swine 
pneumonia associated with <I>Actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae</I>.   Accordingly, 
this  product  has  over-the-counter marketing  status.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 
this approval qualifies for marketing exclusivity, because new clinical or 
field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) were 
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.  
DENAGARD &#174;  is under patent numbers U.S. #3919290, #3987194, and #4278674; 
expiring November 11, 1992, October 19, 1993, and July 14, 1998, respectively.<p>

 <b>4.  Effectiveness - Pivotal Studies</b> <p>
 The New Animal Drug Application for ivermectin tablets contains adequate and
well controlled studies which demonstrate their efficacy in preventing
heartworm infections in dogs. <p>
 <b>Dose Titration and Confirmation</b> <p>
The effectiveness of ivermectin tablets was established in  11 controlled
(necropsy) trials.  These trials which 
included 370 ivermectin-treated dogs and 83 unmedicated control dogs were
utilized to select and confirm the appropriate dose.  The chewable tablet
formulation used in the first three trials (see Table 1) was later found
unacceptable.  The active ingredient of the chewable tablet, ivermectin, was
the same as that of the market formulation.  The chewable tablets performed
similarly in the early trials to the market formulation tablet used in the more
recent eight efficacy trials (and all of the field trials).<p>
The methods used in the induced infection studies were those described by
McCall (J. Georgia Entomol. Soc. (16) 1st Supplement 283-293, 1981).<p>

At necropsy in each trial, the pleural cavity, pre-cava, right atrium, right
ventricle and pulmonary arteries and branches in the lungs were examined  for
 worms.  The worms (<i>D. immitis </i>) from each dog were counted, sexed and preserved in fixative.<p>
 Total numbers of heatworms found at necropsy were analyzed in each trial.
The data were transformed for calculation of geometric means and percent
efficacies to  
 the natural logarithm of (count &#43; l). <p>
 Percent efficacy was calculated using the formula: 

<pre>
                                          
                 Geometric Mean of              Geometric Mean of
                 Heartworm Counts      -     Heartworm Counts for the  
Percent            for Controls             Ivermectin Treatment Group

                                Counts for Controls

</pre>
 
 The trials are identified in table 1 and the results are  
 summarized in tables 2 and 3. <p>
 The recommended minimum dose of 6 mcg of ivermectin per kilogram of body
weight was selected although a lower dose  (3.3 mcg/kg) may 
 be as effective.  In addition to the  
 results of the dose titration and confirmation trials, factors concerning
the practicality of incorporating  
 minute amounts of drug in a reasonably sized tablet with good drug
uniformity and the practical use of the product were considered.  The target
dose of 6 mcg per kilogram of bodyweight was selected from titration study
10855 as the lowest dose providing 100% protection when the dosing interval was
extended to 60 days to simulate a missed-dose circumstance.  Extended interval
dosing trials are summarized in table 3.  The selected dose has a very wide
margin of safety. <p>
 <b>Controlled Clinical (Field) Trials</b> <p>
 The acceptability of the market formulation was tested in seven similar
controlled clinical or field trials.  The trials are further identified in
table 1 and table 4.  At initiation of the trials seven hundred one dogs
received treatment with ivermectin oral tablets and 194 dogs served as controls
receiving daily diethylcarbamazine (DEC).  The dogs were generally randomly
allocated to treatment based on order of presentation.  In four of the studies,
in addition to daily DEC the controls received a monthly placebo
tablet. <p>
 The dogs in each trial were tested for patent heartworm infections
 using  a modified Knott technique or filtration/concentration method at
the beginning and at strategic points during the trials, most frequently at 4
to 5 months, 7 to 9 months, and some at about 12 months.  All  
 of the dog owners were voluntary participants administering the treatments,
making observations, keeping records and having periodic contact with the
investigator to monitor their activities and examine the dogs.  The dogs were
housed and maintained in the customary manner of the owners' household or
kennel. <p>
 Ivermectin was administered monthly in different  sizes of swallow
tablets based on the weight of the dog.  The tablets were designed to provide a
minimum monthly dose of 6 mcg/kg of body weight in four trials and 2 mcg/kg of
body weight in three trials.  The actual doses administered ranged from
approximately 1.5 to 53 mcg/kg. The highest dose was achieved with the 68 mcg
tablet given to an eight-week old yorkshire terrier which weighed 2.8
lb.  Approximately 95&#37; of the ivermectin-treated dogs in these trials received
less than 15 mcg/kg.<p> 
Individual dogs received up to over one year of treatment.  Over 70 different
breeds or types of dogs (including collies) under a wide variety of
circumstances participated in the trials.  Puppies as young as 8 weeks old were
included in the trials.  As expected during trials lasting up to over one year,
many dogs were exposed  to  a  wide variety  of  veterinary or
animal health products including vaccines, anesthetics, analgesics,
anthelmintics, ectoparasiticides (including flea control products),
antimicrobials, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, steroids, hormones and a
variety of ophthalmic and dermatologic preparations. <p>
The most frequent clinical or adverse observations were vomiting, loose feces
or diarrhea, decreased activity and  decreased appetite.  They were observed
at similar incidences in both the DEC-treated controls and the
ivermectin-treated dogs.  None of these observations was thought to be due to
treatment. <p>
One dog experienced an apparent allergic reaction within three hours after
ivermectin treatment on two occasions.  The dog recovered without apparent
residual effects.<p>
There  were  no other clinically significant observations 
 which were related to treatment. <p>
 Three hundred forty-eight of the ivermectin-treated  dogs  and 96 of
the DEC (control) dogs were evaluated for efficacy after 7 months to l year of
treatment with 197 of the ivermectin-treated dogs and 48 of the DEC controls
being retested at one year to 16 months.  The remainder of the dogs starting on
trial were withdrawn by their owners for a wide-variety of reasons most of
which were unrelated to treatment.  Three animals were withdrawn from the
trials, one for vomition, one for inappetence and one with  
 apparent allergic reaction.  The most common reasons for declining numbers
of patients was the owner moving from the area, change of ownership of an
animal, or death  
due  to unrelated  causes.<p>
Only two dogs which had been identified as not being infected before the start
of the trials had circulating microfilariae at the end of the trials.  One of
these dogs was a DEC-treated control.  The owner of the other dog, one treated
with ivermectin, admitted that he had failed to administer the tablets on
several occasions.<p>
<b>Conclusions</b><p>
Three hundred seventy dogs in controlled efficacy trials were treated with
ivermectin.  Of the 83 dogs treated at monthly intervals in natural infection
trials, or treated 30 days after induced infection, with doses of ivermectin at
3.0 mcg/kg or greater, only 2 dogs developed infections.  Even when the
treatment interval was extended to 45 or 60 days following infection, only 2 of
88 dogs given ivermectin at 6.0 mcg/kg or more developed infections.<p>
Therefore,  HEARTGARD-30   with a monthly dose of 6.0 mcg/kg is
effective in preventing canine heartworm disease.<p>
 <b>5.  Animal Safety - Pivotal Studies</b> <p>
 Five toxicity or tolerance trials, three breeding animal safety trials and
three trials on the acceptability of treating dogs with patent heartworm
infections (heartworm positive dogs), have been conducted.  The trials are
further identified in table l. <p>
 Because high levels of ivermectin are required for appropriate safety
testing compared to the low dose and dilute nature of the oral tablet market
formulation, the market formulation could not be used to administer the
necessary elevated levels in these trials.  Impractical 
 and irrelevant numbers of tablets would have been required, therefore,
other formulations were utilized (as described below).  When lower doses were
administered the heartworm-positive-dog studies, the market formulation was
used.  The ivermectin used in all of these studies is the same as the ivermectin
in the market formulation. <p>
 
 <b>Toxicity and Tolerance</b> <p>
 
 <b>TT#78-038-0 - Tolerance - Fourteen Week Toxicity Study in
Dogs</b> <p>
Twenty male and 20 female beagles from 39 to 43 weeks of  age were
divided into five treatment groups of eight dogs each, four of each sex, and
were allocated to treatment. Treatments were administered daily for 94 to 95
consecutive days by intubation.  Three groups received ivermectin at 500, 1,000
or 2,000 mcg/kg/day and two groups served as controls receiving either sesame
 vehicle or deionized water, also daily.<p>
The dogs were evaluated based on weights, ophthalmologic examinations,
electrocardiograms, hematologic and serum biochemical studies, urinalyses and
appropriate gross and histopathologic examinations.<p>
No potentially drug-related abnormalities were detected in any examination or sample,
and no adverse reactions were 
observed in any dog receiving ivermectin at 500 mcg/kg/day during the 14 week
study.<p>
Mydriasis was detected in dogs receiving 1000 mcg/kg/day after 15 days.  A
retardation in weight gain was also observed in this treatment group.  No other
treatment-related effects were detected during examinations or in samples from
the group.<p>
No abnormalities or adverse reactions were detected in dogs after the first
dose of 2,000 mcg/kg.  Mydriasis was 
first clinical sign observed and was eventually seen in all 
dogs in this group, and more severe signs were seen in some dogs including
salivation, tremors, ataxia, 
anorexia, dehydration and weight loss.  No other treatment-related changes were
found.<p>

<b>TT#79-2869 - Acute Toxicity in Dogs</b><p>
 Two male and two female beagle dogs, 10 to 14 months of age, were allocated
to each of four treatment groups: ivermectin at 2,500 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/kg
body weight or vehicle.  Sesame oil was the drug solvent or vehicle.  The
treatments were administered  by  gastric intubation.   The  dogs
were observed for 14 days. <p>
 Emesis, salivation, mydriasis, absence of pupillary response and tremors
were seen in some dogs following treatment at the two higher dose levels.  One
of the dogs given the highest dose became ataxic and sedated.  The dog
recovered from the sedation within 48 hours of treatment and from the remaining
signs 72 hours after treatment. Mydriasis and absence of pupillary response
were the only  clinically significant signs seen at the lowest ivermectin
dose level (2,500 mcg/kg).  None of the signs persisted  past the sixth day
after treatment. <p>

<b>TT#81-2500 - Acute Toxicity in Dogs</b><p>
Each of 2 male and 2 female beagle dogs, 6 to 9 months of age, were allocated
to receive ivermectin at 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 40,000 or 80,000 mcg/kg body
weight or sesame oil vehicle.  The treatments  were  administered by
gastric intubation.  The dogs were observed for 14 days.<p>
Emesis following treatment was seen in at least one dog in all treatment groups
(including vehicle) except 40,000 mcg/kg.  Mydriasis was seen in most dogs at
all ivermectin dose levels.  Ataxia and tremors were seen at doses of 10,000
mcg/kg and greater.  Salivation was noted in some dogs at the two highest
ivermectin dose levels.  One dog given 40,000 mcg/kg and three dogs given 80,000
mcg/kg  were  unable  to stand beginning four to six hours after
treatment.  One of these dogs (at the highest dose level) was up the next
morning; however, the other three remained down, became comatose and died.
Three of four dogs given 40,000 mcg/kg and two of four dogs given 80,000 mcg/kg
survived.  All of the surviving ivermectin-treated dogs appeared normal at the
end of the study. <p>

  <b>TT#81-025-0 - Acute Toxicity in Young Dogs</b><p>
Five groups of three male and three female pups (11 to 12 weeks old)
were allocated to receive subcutaneous injections of ivermectin in a micelle
solution at 4,700, 9,400, 18,800, 37,500 or 75,000 mcg/kg body weight while a
sixth group of two female and three male pups received only vehicle.<p>
The 15 day trial included observations for clinical signs and an ophthalmologic
examination of survivors eight days after treatment.  All dogs were
necropsied.<p>
Mydriasis, negative pupillary response to light and ataxia were detected the
day after treatment in dogs receiving 4,700 mcg/kg.  All dogs in this group
appeared normal by the seventh day after treatment.<p>
Emesis was seen in one dog given 9,400 mcg/kg and in one dog given 75,000
mcg/kg.  Mydriasis, ataxia, salivation, negative pupillary light response,
decreased activity, tremors and death were experienced in groups receiving
ivermectin at 9,400 mcg/kg and greater doses.<p>
No treatment-related abnormalities were detected in the ophthalmic examination
of surviving dogs eight days after treatment.<p>
Other than agonal changes no treatment-related histologic changes  were
 detected.<p>

<b>ASR 11017 - Acute Toxicity in Collies (Breed)</b><p>
Sixteen purebred collies, eight of each sex and half of the animals affected
with collie eye anomaly (CEA) and half free of the anomaly, were utilized to
determine if ivermectin was toxic in collies at levels not generally  
toxic to other breeds and if collie eye anomaly (CEA) was related to
sensitivity.<p>
 The dogs were allocated to four treatment groups so that each sex with each
eye status was represented in each treatment group.  The four treatment groups
were: untreated control, ivermectin at 50 mcg/kg, 200 mcg/kg or 600 mcg/kg.
Ivemectin was administered orally in a fractionated coconut oil
solution. <p>
 Frequent clinical neurologic examinations were made for 7 days.  Necropsies
and histopathologic evaluations and tissue ivermectin assays were made on three
dogs, two of which where showing severe signs of toxicity and one control.  In
a second phase, the three remaining dogs, which had originally served as
controls, were given  ivermectin at 50 mcg/kg and examined for 4 days.<p> 
Signs of toxicity were detected in a female free of CEA after receiving ivermectin
at 600 mcg/kg and in a CEA-affected male after receiving 200
mcg/kg.  The 
 evolving signs included ataxia with gradually increasing hypermetria,
depression, tremors, paresis, recumbency, mydriasis, drooling, paralysis and
coma with predominantly diaphragmatic respiration.  The affected dog in the
highest dose group was euthanized <i>in  extremis </i>&#160;
approximately 28 hours after treatment, and the other affected dog died
approximately 5l hours after treatment. <p>
The histologic findings, including pulmonary congestion,  pulmonary edema
and multifocal hemorrhages in central nervous tissue were all likely related to
agonal death or the euthanasia technique and were not felt to be effects
 of  ivermectin treatment. <p>
 Ivermectin tissue assays showed high concentrations of ivermectin in the
central nervous system. <p>
 Two other dogs, one male in the 600 mcg/kg group and one  female in the
200 mcg/kg group, both not affected with  CEA, showed slight transitory
signs.<p>
The  signs seen in the affected collies were similar to those seen in the
dogs in the toxicity and tolerance  studies at doses of 2500 mcg/kg and
greater.<p>
 Sensitivity to ivermectin did not appear to be related to CEA.  None of the
collies given ivermectin at 50 mcg/kg showed signs of toxicity. <p>
 
 <b>Breeding Animal Safety <p>
 
 Teratology in Laboratory Animals </b><p>
 Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, rabbits, and mice at
or near maternotoxic dose levels.  At these high doses, evidence of a
teratogenic effect is limited to cleft palate that occurs at a low frequency in
all three species and clubbing of the forepaws which occurs only in rabbit
fetuses. Mice are the most sensitive species to the effects of  Ivermectin
with maternotoxlclty at a dose of 200 mcg/kg/day and teratogenicity at 400
mcg/kg/day.  In rabbits 6000 mcg/kg/day was maternotoxic and teratogenlc, and
teratogenicity was also evident at a dose of 3000 mcg/kg/day. The threshold for
both maternotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats was 10,000 mcg/kg/day.<p>

<b>TT#80-704-0 - Teratology in Dogs</b><p>
A solution of ivermectin in sesame oil was administered by stomach tube at a
dose level of 500 mcg/kg to one group of 14 pregnant beagles on Days 5, 15, 25
and 35 of gestation, and a second group of 15 pregnant beagles received the
same dosage of ivermectin on Days 10, 20, 30 and 40 of gestation.  An
additional group of 12 pregnant beagles served as controls and received the
vehicle on Days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 of gestation.  All dogs were
hysterectomized on Day 48 of gestation and the uterine contents removed and
examined.  All fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and
skeletal  alterations. <p>
 The pregnant females were observed at ]east once daily for clinical signs
of toxicity and were weighed frequently during the trial. <p>
There were no clinical signs of toxicity among pregnant female dogs
receiving ivermectin.   Average maternal body weight gains were not
affected by ivermectin treatment.<p>
Ivermectin had no effect on the reproductive status of pregnant bitches
as monitored by the number of implants, resporptions, and live and dead fetuses
per pregnant female.<p>
 There was no evidence of a teratogenic effect at external, visceral, or
skeletal examination of fetuses from bitches treated with ivermectin.  At
initial examination, there was an apparent increase in sternebral variations in
fetuses from ivermectin-treated bitches.  The evaluation of these variations is
highly subjective and a reexamination of the fetuses in this study by
additional pathologists, not advised of the treatment groups, found no
meaningful differences in the incidences of litters with these variations
between treated and untreated control groups.  The sternebral ossification
process and the size, shape and orientation of sternebra are highly variable.
The type of variations seen in this study have been reported to occur at high
and variable frequencies in fetuses from untreated bitches in the colony used
in this study and in other colonies.  These variations are not detectable after
birth. <p>

<b>ASR 11014 - Safety in Breeding and Pregnant Bitches</b><p>
 Thirty non-pregnant beagle bitches of proven reproductive performance were
randomly allocated to two treatment groups with the first ten animals in each
group to come into estrus used to complete the trial.  The two treatments were
vehicle or ivermectin at 600 mcg/kg in fractionated coconut oil; both were
administered orally. The bitches were treated monthly (at least twice) until
coming into estrus and being bred.  Treatments were then administered  on
 approximately  days  10, 25 and 45 of gestation (from first
acceptance of the stud) and continued on a monthly regimen until the pups were
weaned at six weeks of age.  Therefore, each bitch that became pregnant
received at least five or as many as ll treatments depending on when she came
into estrus. <p>
 All of the bitches were given physical examinations including evaluations
of hematology and serum chemistry and urinalysis prior to the first treatment
and at the end of the study.  The animals were frequently observed throughout
the trial. <p>
  Pups were closely examined at whelping and at weaning. 
All dead pups including any stillborns were necropsied.<p>
 No meaningful differences were detected between groups for incidence or
frequency of any clinical observations. <p>
All bitches in the ivermectin group were successfully bred, while nine of the
10 vehicle-treated bitches became pregnant.<p>
 An average of 6 live pups was born to each pregnant ivermectin-treated
bitch, with 93.3% of the pups whelped surviving to weaning.  In the
vehicle-treated group, each pregnant bitch whelped an average of 5.44 pups with
85.7% of the pups whelped surviving to weaning. <p>
No anomalies were found in the bitches in either physical examination.
Laboratory studies detected some values outside of reference 'normal'
parameters in both treatment groups; however, no patterns were evident and
the 
 variations were not attributed to treatment.  No clinically
meaningful differences were observed between groups for bitch or puppy
weights. <p>
 Congenital abnormalities were detected in four puppies from bitches in the
vehicle group and two puppies from the ivermectin group. <p>
 No bitches died during the trial.  Seven puppies from the vehicle group and
four puppies from the ivermectin group died between birth and weaning. <p>
 None of the observations was related to ivermectin  treatment, as they
occurred at similar or greater incidence in the control group.<p>
From this trial, it is obvious that ivermectin, even at high and repeated
doses, has no effects on the breeding or reproductive performance of canine
females.<p>
 
<b>ASR 11015 - Safety in the Breeding Male (Stud) Dog</b><p>
Twelve healthy male beagle dogs of proven breeding performance were divided
into six replicates of two dogs each in order of pretreatment average sperm
count ranking.  Within each replicate, the dogs were randomly allocated to
receive either tap water (controls) or ivermectin at 600 mcg/kg in a
fractionated coconut oil solution.  Treatments were administered at 30-day
intervals from the start of the trial to necropsy so that each stud received 8
treatments.<p>
Semen samples were collected from each stud every third day beginning 28 days
prior to the first treatment and continuing for 83 days after that treatment.
Standardized techniques were used in the collection and in the evaluation of
the semen samples.  Beginning approximately two weeks after the last sample was
collected, each stud was bred to two bitches.  The studs were necropsied after
the last of the bitches whelped.<p>
 The studs were given a physical examination prior to the first treatment
and at the end of the trial.  Hematology, blood and serum chemistry and
urinalyses were performed prior to the first treatment and at the end of the
study. The studs were closely observed throughout the trial.  The studs were
weighed prior to each treatment and at the end of the trial.  The necropsy
evaluation included the gross examination of the organ systems as well as the
histopathological examination of the testes and epididymides. <p>
 The results of each stud being bred to two healthy untreated bitches were
evaluated for breeding behavior, fertility (conception rate), litter size,
puppy body weights and puppy abnormalities.  Any puppies that died or were born
dead were closely examined or necropsied. <p>
 There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in incidence
and frequency of significant clinical observations or in stud weight
changes. <p>
  No anomalies were detected by the physical examinations of the
studs before or after treatment.  While certain clinical chemistry and
urinalysis values for individual dogs in both the control and ivermectin
treatment groups may be considered to be outside expected normal values, these
variations were scattered randomly, occurring without apparent patterns.  The
variations were not indicative of any clinical syndrome, were seen in both
groups before treatment as well as at the end of the trial and are not
attributable to treatment.<p>
No pattern of differences were found between ivermectin-treated dogs and
controls for total sperm counts, percent progressively motile sperm or speed of
progression of sperm.  No deviations from normal were experienced for semen
color or pH, or for sperm morphology or abnormalities (primary, secondary or
tertiary).<p>
 
One bitch bred to an ivermectin-treated stud did not become pregnant.
The first bitch bred to that stud did become pregnant.  All other breedings in
both treatment groups were successful.  The fertility index (number conceived
per number mated x 100) for the ivermectin group was 91.7 and 100 for the
controls.  The mean fertility rate at the colony is 90.2%.  Considering the
prolonged period of manual semen collection, no unexpected or 
breeding behavior was experienced in the studs.<p>
No abortions were observed in bitches bred to studs of either group.<p>
No meaningful differences were observed between groups for  litter size or
for average puppy weight in a litter. The only observed important abnormalities
were in puppies from the control group breeding and included one undershot jaw,
and one cleft palate. <p>
At necropsy, no differences were observed histologically in the testes and
epididymides between the ivermectin-treated and water-placebo-treated-control
groups.  The testes and epididymides of both groups were essentially normal.
Spermatogenesis occurred in an organized manner in both groups.  No treatment
related pathologic lesions were found in any of the dogs.<p>
 This trial demonstrates that repeated administration of ivermectin at doses
many times greater than the dose for heartworm prevention has no clinically
significant effect on dogs and specifically demonstrates that ivermectin is
safe for use in breeding male (stud) dogs. <p>

 <b>ASR 10843, 10844 and 10972 - Acceptability in Dogs With</b> <br>
 <b>Patent Heartworm  Infections (Microfilariae-positive Doqs)</b> <p>
 The effects of ivermectin treatment on dogs with patent heartworm
infections as indicated by the presence of circulating microfilariae was
examined in three similar studies (see table l for identification of
trials).<p>
In these trials, a total of 80 dogs with naturally acquired <i>DirofiIaria
immitis</i>&#160; infections confirmed using a modified Knott technique, were
utilized.  The animaIs were mature dogs of both sexes and several different
breeds and crosses.<p>
In each trial, the dogs were randomly allocated to the four treatment groups;
untreated control, ivermectin at 2 or 10 mcg/kg in the swallow tablet
formulation or at 400 mcg/kg in a fractionated coconut oil solution.  Each of
the ivermectin treatments was administered orally three times at monthly
intervals (28-30 days).  The dogs were closely observed throughout the trial.
Blood samples were taken prior to the first treatment and several times during
the trial and evaluated using a modified Knott technique or direct count
method.  Patent infections were assumed to continue as no adulticidal agent was
administered.  Observations and sampling continued until the end of the trials,
approximately two weeks after the third treatment.  The dogs were given a
physical examination prior to the initial treatment and at the end of the
trials.<p>
 
Adverse reactions, possibly related to the destruction of  microfilariae and
release of antigen following the oral administration of ivermectin to
heartworm-positive dogs included varying levels of vomiting, soft,
poorly-formed feces and diarrhea (some with blood flecks or a bloody tinge).

In ASR 10843, most of these reactions were seen after the third treatment.
More reactions were observed in the dogs given ivermectin at 400 mcg/kg than in
those given 2 or l0 mcg/kg. <p>
The types of reactions seen in these trials are commonly observed in dogs, were
transitory and did not appear to endanger the dogs' health.  None of the dogs
experienced the severe DEC-type shock reaction.  These results agree with the
finding of Boreham (Boreham, P.F.L. and Atwell, R.B.:  Absence of shock-like
reactions to ivermectin in dogs infected with  <i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>.  Journal
of Helminthology:   57, 279-281,1983).<p>

<b>Conclusions</b><p>
With a dose of 6 mcg/kg being effective against the tissue 
30 larval stage of <i> Dirofilaria immitis  </i>, HEARTGARD 
(ivermectin oral tablet) has a wide margin of safety in normal dogs.  When
administered daily to beagles for 14 weeks, ivermectin at 500 mcg/kg had no
adverse effects and 1,000 mcg/kg had only mild effects.  No adverse effects
were detected after a single dose of 2,000 mcg/kg.  In acute toxicity studies,
deaths did not occur at oral doses below 40,000 mcg/kg.  When toxic levels of
ivermectin are administered to dogs, the signs seen may include mydriasis, loss
of pupillary response, loss of menace reflex, depression, ataxia, tremors,
recumbency, salivation, coma and death.<p>
Even in those individual dogs, particularly of the collie breed, that have
an unusual and extreme sensitivity to the toxic effects of ivermectin, an
adequate safety margin exists with  HEARTGARD-30. <p>
For dogs with patent heartworm infections, treatment with  HEARTGARD-30 
 poses no threat to their health.<p>
Neither the reproductive performance nor the offspring of breeding females or
males were adversely affected by repeated, relatively high (500-600 mcg/kg)
doses of ivermectin.<p>

<b>m.  Date of Summary:  </b>April 6, 1994<p>

<b>2.    TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with Baciferm.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR &#167;558.550. Bacitracin zinc is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.78. 
The combination of salinomycin sodium, bacitracin zinc and roxarsone is
codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.550(a) and (b)(1)(vii).<p>
  
<b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<p>
<b>a.    Tolerances/Safe Concentrations for Residues</b><p>
The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<p>
Tolerances for residues of bacitracin from bacitracin zinc are established at
0.5 ppm negligible residues in uncooked edible tissues of chickens (21 CFR
&#167;556.70).<p>
<b>b.    Withdrawal Time</b><p>
As provided in 21 CFR &#167;558.550(b)(1)(vii), a 0-day withdrawal time
is required for the combination of bacitracin zinc and salinomycin.<p>
<b>c.    Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels in
all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were significantly
below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>
A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for bacitracin
residues. The method entitled "Modified Microbiological Method for
Determination of Bacitracin in Tissues" is on file at the Center for Veterinary
Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD
20855.<p>
<b>4.    AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of salinomycin sodium and bacitracin zinc,
when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its
labeled indications.<p>

A summary of the data follows.<P>
<b>A. Studies in Moose<P>
1. Study One in Moose</b><P>
<b>Type of Study:</b> Field study.<P>
<b>Name and Address of Investigator:</b><P>
  Dr. Albert W. Franzmann<br>
  Alaska Department of Fish &#38; Game<br>
  Soldotna, Alaska<P>

<b>Study Design:</b><P>
<b>Purpose:</b> Evaluation of Carfentanil as an immobilization agent for moose with
antagonism by diprenorphine.<P>
<b>Test Animals:</b><P>
  1) Number: 92<br>
  2) Age and Sex: Adults of both sexes<br>
  3) Free-ranging moose.<P>

<b>Type of Control:</b><p> Each animal served as its own control. No treatment type of
control was deemed appropriate.<P>
<b>Diagnosis:</b> Not applicable<P>
<b>Dose Forms:</b><p> Injectable liquid.  Active chemical and vehicle are identical to
formulation for which approval is requested.<P>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>  Intramuscular<P>
<b>Dosage Used:</b> 0.006 to 0.014 mg/kg body weight<P>
<b>Test Duration:</b> 12 months, March 1983 to March 1984<P>
<b>Parameters Measured:</b><P>

  1) Dose Administered<br>
  2) Time to Immobilization<br>
  3) Amount of Antagonist<br>
  4) Time to Recovery<br>
  5) Adverse Effects<P>
 
<b>Results:</b><P> Total dosage per moose varied from 2.5 to 5 mg Carfentanil (0.006 to
0.014 mg/kg).  Mean induction time for moose receiving at least 3 mg was 5.0
minutes.  Diprenorphine was used as the antagonist.  During 1983, the dosage
used was 14 mg IV and 6 mg IM.  In 1984, the antagonist dosage was increased
and 20 mg were given IV and 10 to 20 mg IM.  Mean recovery time was 4.2
minutes.  Hyperthermia, acute capture myopathy and/or narcotic recycling were
attributed to 6 mortalities (6.5%) directly associated with immobilization.<P>
<b>Statistical Analysis:</b> None conducted.<P>
<b>Conclusions:</b><P> The data gathered during this study show that Carfentanil citrate
administered at dose ranges of 0.006 - 0.014 mg/kg body weight intramuscularly to moose produces rapid immobilization
and that the immobilization may be reversed by diprenorphine at a total dose
range of 20 to 40 mg per moose.<P>
<b>Adverse Reactions:</b><P> Six mortalities were observed (6.5%) some of which may have
been treatment related.  These were a result of hyperthermia, acute capture
myopathy and narcotic recycling.<P>
<b>Special Issues:</b> None<P>

<b>Results:</b> Mr. Kimball, Regional Biologist for Utah Game and Fish utilized
Carfentanil under "real world" situations to rapidly immobilize and remove
moose in situations were they had locked antlers or had wandered near towns.
Seven of the 9 moose that were immobilized were reversed with Diprenorphine at
a ratio of approximately 7 mg of Diprenorphine per 1 mg Carfentanil.  One of
the nine was euthanized due to a fractured limb.<P>
<b>Statistical Analysis:</b> None conducted.<P>
<b>Conclusions:</b> Carfentanil citrate administered at 0.006 to 0.015 mg/kg produces
immobilization in moose.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P> The Sika deer in this study weighed an average weight of 90
kilograms. These nine deer were immobilized with an average dose of 0.00825
mg/kg Carfentanil with an average of time to effect of 12.33 minutes. Three
deer had extremely long induction times. Extremely long induction times were
due to incomplete discharge of the aerial dart or subcutaneous injection of the
drug. Carfentanil was reversed by diprenorphine at an average ratio of 10 mg
diprenorphine per 1 mg of Carfentanil administered. Reversal times ranged from
2-6 minutes with a 3.79 minute average.<P>
<b>Statistical Analysis:</b> None conducted<P>
<b>Conclusions:</b> The data support the label dose range for deer.<P>
<b>Adverse Reactions:</b> None<P>
<b>Special Issues:</b><P> This study demonstrates the need for special care in the
administration of Carfentanil. Inadequate injection results in prolonged
induction times as occurred in three of these deer.<P>
<b>E. Exotic Cervidae</b><P>
These data were gathered from the use of Carfentanil in several exotic species
of Cervidae immobilized primarily in captivity at average doses ranging from

<b>V. Animal Safety</b><P>
Conventional safety studies are not feasible given the type of animals for
which the drug is intended. These animals are free ranging or confined members
of the family Cervidae which are the property of individual states or private
organizations. Animal safety was determined under actual conditions of use
whereby some of the members of the family Cervidae received elevated levels of
Carfentanil without the occurrence of adverse effects.<P>
In one study conducted by Dr. Oosterhuis in Formosa deer, 16 animals received
Carfentanil above the highest recommended dose of 10 mcg/kg. The highest dose
of Carfentanil recorded in this study was 37.74 mcg/kg, representing almost a
4X elevation. No adverse reactions were recorded and successful reversal with
the antagonist was accomplished.<P>
Other studies where doses of Carfentanil exceeded the recommended label
dose involved 8 elk (immobilized by different investigators) which received
Carfentanil at 25 mcg/kg or higher; 5 axis deer (immobilized by Dr. Oosterhuis)
which received doses of Carfentanil between 15 mcg/kg and 17 mcg/kg and several
of the exotic Cervidae which received average doses of Carfentanil ranging from
18 mcg/kg to 64 mcg/kg.<P>
Safety to target animals is further augmented by the use of the reversal agent
M50-50 (diprenorphine). This drug has been demonstrated in field studies to
antagonize the narcotic effects of Carfentanil, leading to a more rapid
reversal of the immobilization than if the effects were allowed to wear off
without the use of an antagonist.<P>
In one study, conducted by Meuleman, 4 elk were not administered
diprenorphine following immobilization with Carfentanil. Reversal of the
effects of Carfentanil by natural means required from 75 to 139 minutes. For
free-ranging animals a prolonged down time is dangerous in that it increases
the risk of death associated with rumen stasis and bloating and makes the
animal more susceptible to attacks from predators.<P>
The labeling addresses several adverse reactions observed when the product was
used alone or in combination with other drugs under field conditions.<P>

  5) Adverse Effects<P>
  
  
<b>Results:</b><P> The average dose of Carfentanil used in this study was 16 mcg/kg
which produced immobilization in 3.2 minutes. Immobilization was reversed in
an average time of 1.14 minutes after receiving a narcotic antagonist.<P>
<b>Conclusions:</b> <P>These data support the safe use of Carfentanil at levels beyond
the recommended label dose.<P>
<b>VI. Human Safety</b><P>
a. Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is to be labeled for use
in wild or exotic Cervidae (deer, elk, moose). Labeling contains the following
statement: Do not administer 30 days before or during the hunting season. Do
not use in domestic animals intended for food.<P>
b. Human Safety relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:<P>
Labeling contains adequate directions and <b>WARNING</b> statements for safe use,
i.e:<P>
<pre>
  <b>1. WARNING: CARFENTANIL IS AN EXTREMELY POTENT DRUG AND MUST BE 
     HANDLED WITH EXTREME CARE TO AVOID RISK TO USERS. AVOID 
     ACCIDENTAL ADMINISTRATION TO HUMANS. PLEASE READ HUMAN WARNING 
     SECTION CAREFULLY.</b>
     
     Wildnil (Carfentanil citrate) is a synthetic opiate with a (clinical) 
     potency 10,000 times that of morphine, Mather, L.E., <i>Clin. Pharm</i>. 8, 1983, 
     pp. 422-446. Wildnil (Carfentanil citrate) is a Schedule II Controlled 
     Drug Substance.
     
  <b>2. HUMAN WARNINGS:
     TREATMENT OF ACCIDENTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE</b>
     
     Wildnil (Carfentanil citrate) is an extremely potent drug and is to be 
     used <b>ONLY</b> by individuals experienced in handling potent immobilizing
     agents in zoos, exotic animal and wildlife practices, wildlife management 
     procedures and biological research.
     
     As with all potent drugs capable of producing rapid immobilization in wild
     animals, Wildnil (Carfentanil citrate) must be treated with extreme respect
     and caution. Human safety is critical.
     
     Since Wildnil (Carfentanil citrate) may be employed in locations distant
     from emergency medical facilities, users must <b>ALWAYS</b> observe the 
     following precautions:
    
     1. User should seek professional medical attention <b>immediately</b> if the
        drug is accidentally ingested or injected.
     
     2. At least two people in the field team should be able to recognize signs 
        of toxicity if accidental exposure should occur. They should be 
        familiar with emergency, cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures plus
        have <b>FIRST AID KITS</b> containing resuscitation aids available.
     
     3. <b>WORK IN PAIRS</b> when loading syringes or darts with Wildnil (Carfentanil 
        citrate). Wear rubber gloves when loading syringes to 
        avoid accidental spills on hands.

     4. <b>DO NOT SPRAY;</b> squirt or spill the drug when filling syringes.
     
     5. <b>WASH AT ONCE</b> with large volumes of water if Wildnil (Carfentanil 
        citrate) comes in contact with skin or mucous membranes. 
        
     6. <b>PRACTICE GOOD MEDICAL TECHNIQUES.</b> Do not become careless. Do not 
        hold used needles in mouth. Always ensure that darts and syringes 
        contain proper dose. 
        
     7. <b>REASONABLE EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO LOCATE AND RETRIEVE</b> any 
        loaded darts that missed the target animal.
     
     8. <b>RESPECT</b> all dart guns, darts and power delivery syringes as though they 
        were cocked and loaded.

  <b>3. INFORMATION FOR PHYSICIANS:</b>
     Wildnil (Carfentanil citrate) is a powerful synthetic opiate. Accidental
     human exposure may produce severe central nervous system depression 
     resulting in respiratory depression or failure followed by coma. Depending
     on route of administration, effects may be noted in 2 to 30 minutes. 
     Treatment should start immediately by administering appropriate opiate 
     antagonist, providing airway support, plus cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
     techniques.
     
</pre>     
<b>VII. Agency Conclusion</b><P>
Data submitted in support of this new animal drug application satisfy the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Wildnil
(Carfentanil citrate), when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe
and effective. The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed
veterinarian engaged in zoo and exotic animal practice, wildlife management
programs or research because special professional expertise is required to
properly administer the drug and to safely monitor the patients. Additionally,
the product is a Schedule II Controlled Drug Substance.<P>

P. O. Box 6457<br>
St. Joseph, Missouri  64506-0457<p>
Dear Mr. Schinze:<p>
We refer to your submission dated February 25, 1992, to the Investigational New
Animal Drug (INAD) file for a generic copy of Schering's Banamine (flunixin
meglumine, 50 mg/mL, NADA 101-479).  The product is recommended for the aleviation
of inflammation and pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders in the horse. 
You requested a waiver of the requirement for an <i>in vivo</I>&#160;
bioequivalence study to support the filing of an Abbreviated New Animal Drug
Application (ANADA) based on the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration
Act (GADPTRA) of 1988.<p>
Based on the information you provided, your proposed product is a solution
containing the same active and inactive ingredients in the same concentrations as
the approved pioneer product.  The pH of your product conforms to that of the
pioneer.  It is, therefore, eligible for a waiver from <i>in vivo</I>&#160;
bioequivalence testing under our current policy.<P>
Your request for a waiver is granted on the condition that the full information
presented in your ANADA continues to show that your proposed generic product is
chemically equivalent to the pioneer product.  If it is not shown to be
chemically equivalent, <i>in vivo</I>&#160; bioequialence testing could be
required.<P>
Granting of this waiver does not assure approval of your ANADA.  All necessary
requiremnets must be fulfilled, including certification that your product or its
proposed uses do not violate or infringe upon any patent or exclusivity for the
pioneer product or its uses.<p> 
Future correspondence to your INAD file regarding
this submission should be identified by the date of this letter and our file
number, INAD 8412-C001.<p>
In submitting your ANADA, please refer to this number and include a copy of this
correspondence in your original submission.<p>
<b>Environmental Considerations:</B><P>
Your request for a waiver of the bioequivalency test was reviewed under the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Since no investigation is planned
under your INAD, not wastes are expected to enter the environment.  Therefore, we
have determined that this action qualifies for a categorical exclusion from the
requirement to prepare a environmental assessment (EA) under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(4).
If studies are planned to be conducted under this INAD, please file either a
claim for an exclusion or submit an EA.<p>
All ANADAs require an abbreviated EA.  Guidance is available on the preparation
of the EA in the Center's second generic animal drug policy letter dated June 7,
1989.  The letter contains an example format for preparing an EA for submission to
the ANADA.<p> Contents of an INAD are to be submitted in triplicate (including the
cover letter) [21 CFR 511.1(b)(4)].<p>
Should your have questions or need further assistance, please contact Dr. Sandra
K. Woods, Chief of Equine & Antimicrobial Drugs Branch.  The telephone number is

<b>5.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under Section
512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <p>
Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Flunixin Meglumine, 50
mg/mL, were established by demonstration of chemical equivalence to the pioneer
product, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation's  Banamine&#174; Solution
(flunixin meglumine, 50 mg/mL, NADA 101-479).<p>
This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use.  The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical.  Both drugs are administered by intravenous or intramuscular
injection.  The generic and pioneer products are both solutions that contain
the same active and inactive ingredients in the same concentrations.  Both
products have the same pH.  Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy
promulgated to implement Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional
safety, efficacy, or<i> in vivo  </i>&#160;bioequivalency studies were necessary or
required.  <p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Flunixin Meglumine is safe and effective for its labeled
indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

<b>Marketing Status: </b>   OTC<p>
<b>Date Stamped: </b> March 21, 1989<p>
 
 <b>2. Indications for Use:</b><p>
 
For the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>E. tenella, E. necatrix, E.
acervulina, E. maxima, E. mivati,</i>&#160; and <i>E. brunetti</i>; and for improved feed
efficiency in broiler chickens.<p>
 
 <b>3. Dosage Form:</b><p>
 
Lincomycin and halofuginone hydrobromide are marketed as separate Type A
medicated articles.  The lincomycin Type A medicated article is sold in two
concentrations: 4 and 20 grams lincomycin activity per pound.  Halofuginone
hydrobromide Type A medicated article is sold in one concentration: 2.72 grams
of halofuginone hydrobromide activity per pound.  The route of administration
of these two drugs is oral via the feed.  The recommended dosage is:<p>
 
<b>Lincomycin 2 - 4 g/ton</b><p>  Lincomycin is added to finished broiler feed at
concentrations ranging from 2 to 4 g/ton for improved feed efficiency.<p>
 
<b>Halofuginone hydrobromide</b><p>  Halofuginone is added to finished broiler feed at a
concentration of 2.72 g/ton for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by<i> E.
tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. mivati</i>&#160; and <i>E. brunetti</i>.<p>
 
The resultant feed containing the two drugs is then fed continuously as the
sole ration.  Feeds containing halofuginone hydrobromide must be withdrawn from
broilers 4 days before slaughter.<p>
 
 <b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
<br>
<b>A. Floor Pen Studies - Body Weight &amp; Feed Efficiency:</b><p>
 
The efficacy data for each individual drug is located in its parent NADA and
that data is summarized in the parent FOI: halofuginone hydrobromide, NADA
130-951, approved August 21, 1985 (50 FR 33718); lincomycin, NADA 34-085,
approved May 9, 1970, (35 FR 7300).<p>
 
The New Animal Drug Application on which approval of lincomycin in combination
with halofuginone hydrobromide is based contains adequate and well controlled
studies demonstrating the effectiveness of lincomycin and halofuginone
hydrobromide when feed to broilers.  Four experiments using a randomized
complete block design were conducted utilizing 13,096 broilers which were fed
from one (1) day of age to market weight.  These experiments are summarized and
evaluated below for significant differences in feed efficiency.<p>
 
In these four studies, pens were randomly assigned to treatments within blocks;
50 to 80 birds of equal sex were selected at random and assigned to each pen;
15 to 32 replications were used per treatment group.<p>
 
The studies were done using only the combination of treatments necessary under
a revised guideline for broiler combination efficacy studies (Guideline for
Drug Combinations for Use in Animals, Center for Veterinary Medicine, October
1983).  The Guideline provides for the granting of a range approval for
production drugs in combination when the maximum level tested for the claim(s)
is demonstrated to make a significant benefit to the combination.  Thus, the
following treatments from each of the five studies were pooled and subjected to
statistical analysis:<p>
 
Halofuginone hydrobromide - 2.72 g/ton<br>
Lincomycin - 4 g/ton + Halofuginone hydrobromide - 2.72 g/ton.<p>
 
Studies were designed to simulate varying conditions such as geographical
location, differences in climate, changes in weather, differences in management
practices, and degree of disease contamination of the premises.  The chicks
were grown on old litter and diets were balanced to provide adequate levels of
all nutrients.<p>
 
The effect of lincomycin on feed efficiency is presented in Table I.<p>
 
Analysis of the combined data shows an overall significant (p&lt;0.05) increase
in feed efficiency due to feeding lincomycin in the presence of halofuginone
hydrobromide.  Therefore, under the Guideline, these data are adequate for the
claims shown on Page 1, Item 2, under Indications for Use.<p>

<b>B. Noninterference Battery Study</b><p> 
 
Fourteen day old broiler chickens were used in an adequate well controlled
battery study to test for the noninterference of lincomycin on the
anticoccidial efficacy of halofuginone hydrobromide.  Recent field strain
isolates of coccidia were used. Combinations of <i>E. acervulina, E. maxima, E.
tenella, E. brunetti, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati/mitis</i>&#160; were used.  This
arrangement facilitated identification of lesions.  The broilers were
randomized and assigned to cages with 10 broilers per cage.  There were four
(4) replicates of each treatment group.  Table 2 shows the treatments used in
this battery study along with the results for average weight gain, dropping
scores, lesion scores and coccidiosis mortality.<p> 
 
This battery study adequately demonstrates that there is no interference of
lincomycin on the anticoccicial  efficacy of halofuginone hydrobromide.
Therefore, this combination is compatible.<p>

The data provided corroborative evidence of the Safety and Efficacy of the
combination of halofuginone hydrobromide and lincomycin in the feed of broiler
chickens and these data are consistent with and fulfill all the requirements
for a fixed combination drug for animals as follows:<p> 
  
a. Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed effects.<p> 
 
b. The dosages of each drug component are such that the combination is safe and
effective.<p> 
 
c. This combination demonstrates significant control of a specific disease
condition for a large patient animal population. Specifically, <i>Eimeria tenella</i>&#160;
is a major widespread organism of coccidiosis and the most pathogenic <i>Eimeria</i>&#160;
species and, as such, possesses the potential of causing extensive economic
losses to broiler producers.<p> 
 
d. The label claims are not antagonistic.<p> 
 
Based on the data in the parent NADA's, the compatibility battery studies and
the floor pen efficacy studies, we concluded that the combination of these two
drugs is safe to feed to broiler chickens as indicated by the label.<p> 
 
 <b>6. Human Safety:</b><p> 
 
 <b>A. Toxicity Tests:</b><p> 
 
The original NADA's contain FOI summaries and complete information of human
food safety on the two products (NADA 34-085, lincomycin published May 9, 1970,
[35 FR 7300] NADA 130-951, halofuginone hydrobromide published August 21, 1985,
[50 FR 33178]).<p> 
 
 <b>B. Safe Concentration or Tolerance of Residues:</b><p> 
 
Halofuginone hydrobromide has an established tolerance in broiler chickens of
0.1 ppm for parent halofuginone hydrobromide (marker residue) in liver which is
the target tissue (21 CFR 556.308).  A marker residue concentration of 0.1 ppm
in liver corresponds to a concentration for total residues of halofuginone
hydrobromide of 0.3 ppm in the liver, (21 CFR 556.308).  The safe
concentrations for total halofuginone hydrobromide in the uncooked edible
tissues of broiler chickens are 0.1 ppm in muscle, 0.3 ppm in liver and 0.2 ppm
in skin with adhering fat, (21 CFR 556.308).<p> 
 
The tolerances for lincomycin are established at 0.1 ppm for negligible
residues in the edible tissues of broiler chickens, (21 CFR 556.360).<p> 
 
 <b>C. Residue Depletion Noninterference Study</b><p> 
 
The residue data supporting the approved individual uses of halofuginone
hydrobromide and lincomycin and their respective withdrawal times of four and
zero days have been submitted in their respective original applications.  The
summary of the study conducted for this combination is presented in Table IV and
establishes that each drug in the presence of the other does not exceed its
established safe concentration(s) or tolerance(s) and that none of the drugs
interferes with the other's tissue residue assay.  The broilers in that study
were fed the combination of halofuginone hydrobromide (2.72 g/ton), lincomycin
(4 gm/ton) and roxarsone (45.4 g/ton) for 49 days prior to the withdrawal
period. Edible tissues, including liver, muscle and skin/fat were assayed for
drug residues.  The edible tissues were collected on the withdrawal dates
indicated in Table VI.<p>

<b>D. Assay Noninterference:</b><p>
 
Along with the residue depletion results presented in Table IV, the sponsor
conducted a noninterference study for the lincomycin tissue assay by spiking
samples with lincomycin (0.15 ppm) and halofuginone hydrobromide (0.30 ppm) and
conducting assays for lincomycin residues.  The results demonstrated no
interference by halofuginone hydrobromide on the assay for lincomycin.<p>
 
The sponsor conducted a noninterference study for halofuginone hydrobromide by
spiking control tissue samples with halofuginone hydrobromide (0.10 ppm) and
lincomycin (0.20 ppm) and then assaying these tissues for halofuginone
hydrobromide content.  The results demonstrated no interference by lincomycin
on the tissue assay for halofuginone hydrobromide.  <p>
 
A 4 day withdrawal period is established for this combination based on a 99%
statistical tolerance limit with 95% confidence. These data support a 4 day
withdrawal for the halofuginone hydrobromide/lincomycin combination.<p>

<b>E. Regulatory Methods:</b><p>
 
The tissue assay method for halofuginone hydrobromide is an HPLC method titled,
"Analysis of an Anti-coccidial Drug, Halofuginone , in Poultry Tissue".  The
method is on file at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug
Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.<p>
 
The tissue assay method for lincomycin is a microbiological method titled
"Standard Operating Procedure for a Tissue Residue Study in Broiler Chickens
Treated with Lincomycin, U-10, 149A".  The method is on file at the Center for
Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, MD 20857.<p>
 
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
 
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and demonstrate that halofuginone hydrobromide (2.72 g/ton) plus
lincomycin ( 2 to 4 g/ton) are safe and effective when fed to broiler chickens
at the dosage levels for the indications stated in Section 3 of this FOI
Summary.<p>
 
Under the Center's supplemental policy (42 FR 64367; December 23, 1977) this
original application is regarded as a Category 2 supplemental NADA which did
not require a reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent NADAs.
The drugs are to be fed in Type C medicated feeds, in accordance with the
labeling as approved in the parent NADAs.<p>
 
Residue depletion studies in this application demonstrate the halofuginone
hydrobromide depletes to safe concentration within four (4) days withdrawal to
no more than 0.1 ppm in muscle, 0.3 ppm in liver and 0.2 ppm in skin/fat (21
CFR 556.308); lincomycin is below the tolerance of 0.1 ppm at zero withdrawal
(21 CFR 556.360).  Adequate information was submitted to demonstrate
noninterference between the assays for each drug.  The approval os this
application will not significantly increase exposure of humans to residues of
the drugs.<p>
 
The data from six well controlled trials demonstrate the effectiveness of
lincomycin for improved feed efficiency in the presence of halofuginone
hydrobromide when mixed in broiler chicken feeds.  The data from
noninterference battery study demonstrated the effectiveness of halofuginone
hydrobromide in preventing coccidiosis in the presence of lincomycin.  CVM's
guideline for drug combinations for use in animals provides for the granting of
range approval for lincomycin as shown in Section 3 of this document.  A four
(4) day withdrawal period is required before the broiler chickens may be
slaughtered for human food.<p>

Loughrea, County Galway<br>
Ireland<p>

<i>Trade Name</i>:<p>Chanazine&#174; 20 mg/mL<p>
<i>Established Name</i>:<p>Xylazine hydrochloride, 20 mg/mL<p>
<i>Dosage Form</i>:<p>Solution<p>
<i>How Supplied</i>:<p>20 mL multiple dose vials<p>
<i>How Dispensed</i>:<p>Rx<p>
<i>Amount of Active Ingredients</i>:<p>Each mL contains 20 mg xylazine, base equivalent<p>
<i>Route of Administration</i>:<p>Intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous<p>
<i>Species</i>:<p>Dogs and cats<p>
<i>Labeled Dosages:</i><p>

Intravenously-0.5 mL/20 lbs body weight (0.5 mg/lb)<p>

Intramuscularly or subcutaneously-1 mL/20 lbs body weight (1 mg/lb)<p>

In large dogs (over 50 lbs), a dosage of 0.5 mg/lb 	administered
intramuscularly may provide sufficient 	sedation and/or analgesia for most
procedures.<p>
These doses produce sedation which is usually maintained for 1 to 2 hours
and analgesia which lasts for 15 to 30 minutes.<p>

<i>Indications for Use:</i><p>

Chanazine (xylazine) should be used in dogs and cats when it is desirable
to produce a state of sedation 	accompanied by a shorter period of analgesia.
Xylazine has been used successfully as follows:<p>

1. 	Diagnostic procedures - examination of mouth and ears, abdominal palpation,
rectal palpation, vaginal examination, catheterization of the bladder and
radiographic examinations.<p>

2. Orthopedic procedures, such as application of casting materials and
splints.<p>
3. Dental procedures.<p>
4. Minor surgical procedures of short duration such as debridement, removal
of cutaneous neoplasms and suturing of lacerations.<p>
5. To calm and facilitate restraint of fractious animals.<p>
6. Therapeutic medication for sedation and relief of pain following injury or
surgery. <p>
7. Major surgical procedures:<p>
a.  	When used as a preanesthetic to general anesthesia.<br>

<i>Pioneer Product</i>:<p>
Rompun &#174; (xylazine) 20 mg/mL Injectable, NADA 047-955 by Bayer Corporation., Agriculture Division, 	Animal Health<p>

<b>2.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; First GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the
Agency grants a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo </i>bioequivalence study
(55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of
bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are
based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product. <p>

Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Chanelle
Manufacturing Pharmaceutical, Ltd. was granted a waiver June 15, 1992
(photocopy attached) from conducting an<i> in vivo</i> bioequivalence study
with Chanazine&#174; 20 mg/mL Injectable.  The generic and pioneer products are
solutions with the same inactive ingredients and the same concentrations of the
active ingredient.  It is intended for intravenous, intramuscular, and
subcutaneous injection.<p>

<b>3.HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>

<b>	Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><p>

Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were not
required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is labeled for use in dogs and
cats only and should not be administered to food-producing animals. <p>

<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling, and Administration:</b><p>

Labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<p>


<b>4.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>

	This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under
Section 512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <p>

Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Chanazine&#174; 20
mg/mL Injectable, were established by demonstration of chemical equivalence to
the pioneer product, Bayer Corporation's Rompun&#174; 20 mg/mL Injectable
(xylazine hydrochloride, 20 mg/mL, NADA 047-955).<p>

This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use.  The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical.  Both drugs are administered by intravenous, intramuscular, or
subcutaneous injection.  The generic and pioneer products are both solutions
that contain the same active and inactive ingredients in the same
concentrations.  Both products have the same pH.  Therefore, consistent with
FDA policy implementing Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional
safety, efficacy, or <i>in vivo</i>bioequivalency studies were necessary or
required.

This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Chanazine is safe and effective for its labeled indications
when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
 Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter)  an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product). For certain dosage forms, the
Agency grants a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalence study
(55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter). In lieu of
bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are
based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.<p>
Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Phoenix

Dear Dr. Schafer,<p>
We refer to your submission dated April 9, 1990, requesting an Investigational 
Exemption for a generic copy of Ketaset (ketamine hydrochloride injection) for 
intramuscular use in cats as an anesthetic and restraining agent and in subhuman primates as a reastraining
agent.  The Submission also contained a request for a waiver of <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence
testing required for an Abbreviated  New Animal Drug Application (ANADA).<p>
Based on the information you provided, your proposed product is a solution containing the
same active and inactive ingredients as the pioneer product.
It is inteded solely for intramuscular injection.  It is, therefore, eligible for waiver from 
<i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing under our current policy.<p>
Your request for a  waiver is granted on the condition that the full
information presented in your ANADA continues to show that your proposed 
generic product is chemically equivalent to the pioneer product.  If it is not shown
to be chemically equivalent, <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing
could be required.<p>
Granting of this waiver does not assure approval of your ANADA.  All
necessary requirements must be fulfilled, including certification that
your product or its proposed uses do not violate or infringe upon any
patent or exclusivity for the pioneer product or its uses.<p>
For administrative purposes, we have assigned you Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD)
number 6752 for the above referenced use of ketamine
hydrochloride.  In submitting your ANADA, please refer to this number and

<b>5.    AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under Section
512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act.<p>
Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Ketaject&#174;  (ketamine
hydrochloride, USP, 100 mg/mL), were established by demonstration of chemical
equivalence to the pioneer product, Fort Dodge Laboratories'
Vetalar&#174;/Ketaset&#174; (ketamine hydrochloride, USP,100 mg/mL. NADA 045-290). <p>
This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use. The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical. Both drugs are administered by intramuscular injection. The
generic and pioneer products are both solutions that contain the same active
and inactive ingredients in the same concentrations. Both products have the
same pH. Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy promulgated to implement
Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety, efficacy, or
<i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.<p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that  Ketaject&#174; is safe and effective for its labeled indications
when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

<b>Sponsor:</b><p>      The Upjohn Company<br>
            Agricultural Division<p> 
<b>Sponsor Number:</b>  000009<p> 
<b>Generic Name:</b>    Melengestrol acetate<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>   MGA&#174; 100/200 Premix, 
            MGA&#174; 500 Liquid Premix<p> 
<b>Generic Name:</b>    lasalocid sodium<br>
<b>Trade Name:  </b>Bovatec&#174;<p> 
<b>Generic Name:    </b>tylosin phosphate<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>  Tylan&#174;<p> 
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC<p> 
<b>Date of Summary:</b> August 6, 1990<p> 
<b>II.  Indications for Use:</b><p> 
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter.<p> 
<b>III.  Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><p> 
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Feed<p> 
<b>Route of Administration:  </b>Oral<p> 
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><ul><p>
    <li>melengestrol acetate - 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
    <li>lasalocid sodium - 10 to 30 g/ton of air dried complete feed<br>
    <li>tylosin phosphate - 8 to 10 g/ton of air dried complete feed (to provide 90
mg/hd/day)</ul><p> 
    Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate (MGA)
per head per day in combination     with 10 to 30 g lasalocid per ton of air dried
complete feed and 8 to 10 g tylosin per ton of air dried complete   feed (to
provide 90 mg/hd/day) when each additive is provided via separate supplements
or a supplement     containing melengestrol acetate is fed in combination with a
complete feed containing lasalocid and tylosin.<p> 
    The supplement containing melengestrol acetate provided at a rate of 0.5 to
2.0 pounds per head may be top-dressed onto or mixed with the feed containing
lasalocid and tylosin.<p> 
    This clearance does not provide for the mixing of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin premixes together     in a common supplement or in a
complete ration offered for sale by the feed manufacturer.<p> 

<b>IV.  Effectiveness:  (In compliance with combination approval claims)</b><p> 
The efficacy of melengestrol acetate for increased rate of weight gain,
improved feed efficiency and suppression of estrus (heat) in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter is well documented and approved  (21CFR 558.342).
Further, the effectiveness of lasalocid for improved feed efficiency and
increased rate of weight gain of feedlot  cattle is established and approved
(21CFR 558.311) as is the effectiveness of tylosin for reduction of liver
abscesses in the same class of cattle (21CFR 558.625).  For these applications,
the efficacy of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin when
co-administered was established by conducting a series of field trials under a
common protocol.  These trials were designed to evaluate the performance of
feedlot heifers fed each drug separately and in combination.<p> 

<b>A.  Pivotal Study</b><p> 
A feedlot heifer study consisting of field trials at nine locations with three
replications per location was conducted to generate animal performance data on
the combination of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and tylosin.  Results of
each study are reported as well as a summary and statistical analysis of the
pooled data from all nine field investigations.<p>

<b>3.  General design of each field investigation</b><p>
    <b>a.  Purpose of the field investigation:</b><p>  To evaluate the effect of
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid sodium and          tylosin phosphate on the
performance of feedlot heifers when fed singly and in combination.<p> 
   <b> b.  Test animals</b><ul><p>
        <li>(1)  Species:  Bovine<br>
        Number/group:  The number of heifers per treatment group varied from location
to location, and ranged from        6 to 14 animals per pen (Table 1).<p> 
        <li>(2)  Subgroup Identity:  Heifers used in the field studies were non-pregnant
yearlings and the breeds were       typical of those commonly found in commercial
feedlots.  The average initial weights ranged from 674 to       826 pounds (Table
1).</ul><p> 
    <b>c.  Control groups</b><p>
        Groups of heifers fed melengestrol acetate, or lasalocid or tylosin alone, or
lasalocid and tylosin in            combination served as controls.  Pairwise,
comparisons were made to groups of heifers for the 3 drugs in
combination.<p>
    <b>d.  Diagnosis:</b>  Not applicable.<p> 
   <b> e.  Dosage form:</b><p>
        (1)  Medicated feed:  Feed was medicated using melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid or tylosin premixes.  Final       feeds were prepared using intermediate
premixes which were either mixed into or top-dressed onto the bulk of       the
ration.<p> 
    <b>f.  Route of drug administration:  </b> 
        (1)  Oral<p> 
   <b> g.  Dosages: </b><p> The dosages used in the field study were: melengestrol acetate,
0.5 mg/head/day; lasalocid, 30      gm/ton of air dried feed; tylosin, 10 gm/ton
of air dried feed.<p> 
   <b> h.  Days on test: </b><p> The cattle were fed for a minimum of 90 days, the actual
day of trial termination being left up      to the investigator's judgement as to
when the cattle had reached market weight and condition.  The days on       test by
location are listed on Table 1.<p>

The melengestrol acetate + lasalocid + tylosin combination was justified since
the contribution of lasalocid   significantly enhanced feed efficiency
(P=0.00531).  In this combination, melengestrol acetate was effective for
estrus suppression (P=0.000012), feed efficiency (P=0.00001), and average daily
gain (P=0.000005).  Tylosin     was also effective in reducing the incidence of
liver abscesses (P=0.00021) in this 3-way combination (Table 7).<p> 
<b>6.  Conclusions</b><p>
    The data generated by the nine location field study demonstrated that the
melengestrol acetate, lasalocid, tylosin    combination is justified for its
effect on estrus suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased rate of
weight  gain and reduction of liver abscesses.  Each drug, melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid and tylosin has been shown to    make a significant
contribution to the effectiveness of the combination.<p> 
<b>7.  Adverse Reactions</b><p>
    No adverse reactions due to the feeding of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid, or
tylosin, either singly or in    combination were reported.<p> 
<b>8.  Special Issues</b><p>
   <b>Compliance with combination drug policy:</b><p> 
    a.  The effectiveness and safety of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid, and
tylosin when fed singly to feedlot cattle       are well documented in their
respective approved NADAs.  The results of effectiveness and safety studies
were        submitted to the FDA in support of these respective NADAs.  Such data
resulted in the approval of             melengestrol acetate as per CFR 558.342,
lasalocid as per CFR 558.311, and tylosin as per CFR 558.625.       Data generated
in support of combination usage have demonstrated that melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and       tylosin fed together are effective and safe.<p> 
        The data establish compliance with 21CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v) and CVM's combination
drug guidelines             (November 9, 1983).  The combination is justified as
detailed in items 4, 5 and 6 above.<p> 
 
        The use of untreated controls was not deemed necessary as a test for general
effectiveness because the           individual drugs have been previously shown to be
effective and already approved at the levels tested.  The       treatment groups
consisting of the individual drugs and the two-way combinations served as the
appropriate         controls for the respective three-way combination.  Thus, these
treatment groups essentially served as          negative controls with respect to
21CFR 514.111 (a)(5)(ii)(a)(4), and the studies were properly controlled.<p> 
        To justify the combination, comparisons were made which demonstrated that
each drug made a statistically      significant contribution to the combination.
The three-way combination provides a benefit that cannot be         obtained from any
of the possible two-way combinations.<p> 
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-lasalocid-tylosin vs. melengestrol
acetate-lasalocid for transformed       percent liver abscesses demonstrates the
contribution of tylosin to the combination.<p> 
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-lasalocid-tylosin vs. lasalocid-tylosin
for ADG, FE and estrus          suppression demonstrates the contribution of
melengestrol acetate to the combination. Significance for any       variable shows
that melengestrol acetate contributes to the combination.<p> 
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-lasalocid-tylosin vs. melengestrol
acetate-tylosin for ADG and FE      demonstrates the contribution of lasalocid to
the combination.  Significance for any variable shows that      lasalocid
contributes to the combination.<p> 
        The proposed ranges for each drug are justified when fed in combination since
the highest levels proposed         were tested in combination for efficiency and
human and animal safety.<p>

<b>V.  Animal Safety:</b><p> 
<b>A.  Pivotal study</b><p> 
The safety of melengestrol acetate, lasalocid and of tylosin in the bovine have
been documented as evidenced by their respective approvals (21CFR 558.342 for
melengestrol acetate, 21CFR 558.311 for lasalocid, and 21CFR 558.625 for
tylosin) as feed additives. The following pivotal study was conducted to
establish the target animal safety of these three additives when fed in
combination.<p>

    The following organs were weighed at necropsy, paired organs weighed
together:<p>
    Adrenals, liver, kidneys and heart.</ul><p> 
<b>4)  Results</b><ul><p>
    <li>a.  Clinical Observations<p>
        No adverse, drug-related clinical signs were observed during this study.
Although there were no significant     
         differences in average daily gain (ADG) between treated and control animals
at mid-study and at termination,        there was a trend toward decreased ADG at
the 3X and 5X levels of treatment.<p> 
    <li>b.  Clinical pathology<p>
        Occasional statistically significant changes in several hematologic and serum
chemistry parameters were       detected, but all values were well within normal
acceptable ranges and no dose-related trends were seen.<p> 
    <li>c.  Gross and microscopic pathology<p>
        Several gross and histologic tissue changes were observed, but due to the
relative even distribution of the       changes in all dose groups including
controls, these findings were considered to be incidental rather than drug-
related.</ul><p> 
<b>5)  Conclusions</b><p>
    Based upon the results of this study, the combination of melengestrol acetate,
lasalocid and tylosin phosphate in  the daily feed of yearling heifers appears
to be non-toxic when fed for 90 days at up to 5 times the recommended   dose.<p>

<b>VI.  Human Safety:</b><p> 
<b>A.  Drugs for use in food animals</b><p> 
<b>1.  Toxicity tests</b><p>
    Data regarding toxicity testing in melengestrol acetate, lasalocid sodium and
tylosin phosphate are contained in  the approved NADAs for the three above
mentioned compounds.<p> 

<b>2.  Safe concentration of residues</b><p>
Tolerances for melengestrol acetate, lasalocid sodium and tylosin phosphate
are published in the <i>Code of Federal     Regulations</i>.&#160; Melengestrol acetate
is currently approved under 21CFR 558.342 for use in heifers at 0.25 to 0.50
mg/head/day with a 48 hour withdrawal period.  No residues of melengestrol
acetate may be found in uncooked    edible tissues of cattle with a method
sensitive to 25 ppb (21CFR 556.380).  The tolerance for lasalocid in    edible
tissue of cattle under 21CFR 556.347 is 0.7 ppm with no withdrawal period
established for cattle under    21CFR 558.311.  The tolerance for tylosin
phosphate has been established at 0.2 ppm (negligible residue) in   uncooked
fat, muscle, liver and kidney (CFR 556.740).  Tylosin phosphate has no
withdrawal period established   under 21CFR 558.625.<p> 

<b>3.  Residue depletion and metabolism studies</b><p>
Numerous studies have been conducted relative to the metabolism and depletion
of residues of melengestrol     acetate, lasalocid, and tylosin when administered
individually to cattle.  The results of those studies have been     filed under
the following submissions:<p>

    The animals in each group were slaughtered within 16 hours following their
last feeding.  Perirenal fat was    collected from all four treatment groups for
the melengestrol acetate analysis, and liver samples were collected     from the
group 1 and 2 animals for the assay of lasalocid and tylosin.<p> 
    <b>a.  Residues of melengestrol acetate</b><p>
        The samples of pererenal fat from each animals were assayed for residues of
melengestrol acetate using the      official AOAC gas chromatographic method.
Analysis of the samples from the group 2 (1X) animals           showed that all fat
samples were below the 25 ppb tolerance for MGA and five of the seven samples
were        below the 10 ppb limit of reliable measurement of the assay.  The two
fat samples that gave positive          responses had MGA levels of 12.7 and 13.7
ppb.<p> 
        Fat samples from groups 3 and 4 (the heifers dosed at 3X and 5X levels)
yielded average residue levels of       37.6 and 49.4 ppm, respectively.<p> 
    <b>b.  Residues of lasalocid</b><p>
        Liver tissue that was collected from the seven control animals and the seven
heifers fed the group 2 (1X)        ration were assayed for lasalocid by the
HPLC   -fluoresence regulatory method for the drug.  An average residue        value of
0.09 ppm (SD. 0.11 ppm) was obtained for the group 2 heifers, and that level is
well below the 0.7      ppm tolerance for lasalocid in the livers from the control
animals.<p> 
    <b>c.  Residues of tylosin</b><p>
        The liver tissue samples from the group 2 (1X) heifers and 7 of the control
animals were assayed for tylosin        by the official assay which measures
microbiologically the active drug.  No positive responses were obtained         for
any of the samples by this method which has a limit of quantitation of 0.1
ppm.<p>
  <b>5.  Assay noninterference data</b><p>
    <b>a.  Melengestrol acetate assay</b><p>
        Data were generated using spiked control fat tissue samples to demonstrate
that the presence of residues of        lasalocid and tylosin does not interfere
with the assay for MGA.  The study was also intended to show that       MGA is
stable  in frozen fat tissue over a period of 60 days.<p> 
        Samples of freshly ground control bovine fat tissue were spiked with MGA,
lasalocid and tylosin at the        following levels:  <p>
        MGA:  0.025<br>
        Lasalocid sodium:  7.0 ppm<br>
        Tylosin phosphate:  1.0 ppm<p> 
The spiked samples were assayed in duplicate for MGA by the official AOAC
method after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days of storage at -20&#176;C.  The average
recoveries are shown below.<p>

        Data demonstrating the noninterference of residues of melengestrol acetate on
the HPLC-fluorescence           detection assay for lasalocid were generated by
Hoffmann-LaRoche to support the original NADA approval      for lasalocid in
cattle (NADA  96-298).  Those data have also been published as a journal
article (<i>J.          Agricultural and Food Chemistry </i>, 31, 75-78 (1983)) and
are summarized below.<p>

<b>c. Tylosin assay</b><p>
        Data to demonstrate that the presence of lasalocid and MGA does not interfere
wit the assay of tylosin are        contained in study S-AAC-84-03 conducted by the
Elanco Products Company.  Samples of liver from control         heifers were
composited and fortified with 0.2 ppm lasalocid, 0.2 ppm tylosin and 0.2 ppm
MGA.  The       samples were assayed for tylosin by the cylinder plate
microbiological method using <i>Micrococcus luteus</i>&#160; as       the test organism.
No interference was detected by the presence of lasalocid and MGA.<p> 
        The stability of tylosin in frozen liver tissue was demonstrated in study
MRC8910 conducted by the Elanco         Products Company.  Liver tissue from control
animals was fortified with 0.2 ppm tylosin and then frozen.         Portions of the
samples were thawed at intervals up to 56 days and assayed for tylosin.  The
stability of        tylosin through 56 days was indicated by the recoveries in the

        Regression analysis of these data demonstrates satisfactory tylosin stability
for the period the tissues in the       residue depletion study were stored before
assay.<p> 
        The residue depletion and assay noninterference studies presented above
demonstrate that the combined feeding       of melengestrol  acetate, lasalocid
sodium, and tylosin phosphate at their highest approved levels results in
tissue residues below the tolerance levels for each of the three drugs at 16
hours of withdrawal.  The data also         show that each drug in the three-way
combination does not interfere with the assays for the others.  This        work
confirms the adequacy of the 48 hour withdrawal time required for the presence
of MGA in the           combination and demonstrates that the use of these feed
additives in combination does not pose a hazard to      public health.<p> 

<b>6. Regulatory methods</b><p>
    Practical analytical methods of analysis for tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, lasalocid sodium and tylosin   phosphate may be found in the <i>Food
Additives Analytical Manual</i>&#160; on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (Room 12-A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.<p>
<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p> 
These NADA's provide for the combination use of MGA, lasalocid sodium, and
tylosin phosphate at the levels of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day, 10 to 30 g/ton of
feed, and 8 to 10 g/ton of feed (to supply 90 mg/head/day), respectively; for
increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of estrus
(heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter.  Adequate data were submitted which show that the MGA,
lasalocid, tylosin combination is justified for its effect on estrus
suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased rate of weight gain and
reduction of liver abscesses.  Each drug; MGA, lasalocid, and tylosin has been
shown to make a significant (P&lt;0.05) contribution to the effectiveness
of the combination.  The combination, when fed at up to 5X the highest
recommended combination approval (0.5 mg MGA/head/day plus 30 g lasalocid/ton,
and 10 g tylosin phosphate/ton for 90 days), did not produce an adverse effect.
No changes were made in the approved levels of the compounds or in the target
animal and the noninterference of tylosin phosphate, lasalocid sodium and MGA
with the analytical methods for MGA, lasalocid sodium and tylosin phosphate,
respectively, was demonstrated.  Accordingly, approval of these NADA's is not
expected to increase human exposure to drug resides, and therefore did not
require a complete re-evaluation of the human safety data in the original
applications.  For the purposes of human food safety review, these original
NADA's have been treated as Category II supplements under the Agency's
Supplemental Policy (42 FR 64367).  These production drugs are OTC because they
do not raise any special safety concerns.<p>

Mix fresh solutions daily. Use as sole source of oxytetracycline. Do not mix this
product directly with milk or milk replacers.  Administer one hour before or two
hours after feeding milk or milk replacers. The concentration of drug required in
medicated water must be adequate to compensate for variation in the age of the
animal, feed consumption rate, and the environmental temperature and humidity,
each of which affects water consumption.  Administer up to 14 days in swine,

Pioneer Product "Listed" Product: </b> Terramycin&#174; Soluble Powder, NADA
008-622<p>
<b>j.  Date of Summary:</b> December 7, 1995<p> 
<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
 Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,
drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue
data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  A tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter, Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990.)<p>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Phoenix
Scientific, Inc. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160;
bioequivalence study for OXYTETRACYCLINE HCL SOLUBLE POWDER.  The generic and
pioneer products are water soluble powders with the same active ingredients and
no differences in the inactive ingredients which would affect absorption of the
active ingredients.<p>
<b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><p>
<b>Tolerance</b><p>
The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.  Tolerances of 3 ppm in uncooked kidney and 1 ppm in uncooked muscle,
liver, fat, and skin are established for residues of oxytetracycline in
chickens and turkeys under 21 CFR 556.500(a).  A tolerance of 0.1 ppm in
uncooked edible tissues is established for residues of oxytetracycline in swine
[21 CFR 556.500(b)], cattle, beef calves, nonlactating dairy cattle [21 CFR
556.500(c)], and sheep [21 CFR 556.500(e)].<p>
<b>Withdrawal Time:</b><p>
When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>&#160;  bioequivalence study
is granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product.<p>
For oxytetracycline hydrochloride, [21 CFR 520.1660d], do not administer to
turkeys, swine, cattle, or sheep within 5 days of slaughter.  Do not administer
to chickens or turkeys producing eggs for human consumption.<p>
<b>Regulatory Method:</b><p>
The analytical method for the determination of oxytetracycline hydrochloride in
tissues uses a microbiological assay procedure.  This method is found in the<b>
</b><i>Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues:
Methods, Reports, and Protocols ,</i> revised October 1968, reprinted December
1974, National Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, FDA, Washington,
D.C. 20204.<p>
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that Oxytetracycline HCl Soluble Powder, when used under its
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled
indications.<p>

The product is supplied as an ear implant for cattle.<P>
<b>FOR HEIFERS</b><P>
One implant for heifers contains 200 mg trenbolone acetate. Each heifer implant
contains 10 pellets of 20 mg trenbolone acetate in each pellet which make up
the dosage of Finaplix&#174; and are contained in one division of a
multiple cartridge. Ten doses are in each cartridge. The cartridge is designed
to be used with a special implant gun. The implant is placed under the skin on
the posterior aspect of the ear by means of an implant gun. This product is to
be used in heifers only during the last 63 days prior to slaughter.<P>
<b>FOR STEERS</b><P>
One implant for steers contains 140 mg trenbolone acetate. Each steer implant
contains 7 pellets of 20 mg trenbolone acetate in each pellet. The same type
multiple dose cartridge and implant gun are used for both the steer and heifer
products.  For continued effectiveness in steers this product should be
reimplanted once after 63 days.<P>
<b>4.  ANIMAL EFFECTIVENESS<P>
A. Pivotal Studies:</b><P>
The new animal drug application on which trenbolone acetate is based contains
adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the new
animal drug for the indications for use as given in Item 2 above.<P>
The pivotal studies are dose titration studies in which the parameters measured
are the same parameters as are measured in clinical (field) studies. The
pivotal studies have been conducted using a uniform protocol for the studies in
heifers and a uniform protocol for the studies in steers so that the results of
the studies may be pooled and summarized separately for heifers and steers. The
studies were conducted in the major beef producing areas of the United
States.<P>

The purpose of the studies was to determine the dose response for trenbolone
acetate implants on average daily gain and feed efficiency of growing finishing
heifers and steers. The test animals were crossbred animals of European breeds.
There were eight animals per pen in all studies. Each treatment was replicated
4 or 5 times in the heifer and steer studies. The heifer and steers weighed
approximately 800 (363 kg) and 740 (336 kg) pounds, respectively, when the
studies were initiated. A total of 1,280 steers and heifers were treated with
trenbolone acetate in these dose titration studies. Four steer and four heifer
studies were conducted.<P>
The trenbolone acetate was given via ear implants. The implants were placed
subcutaneously on the backside of the mid-ear. Each dose was made up of the
appropriate number of pellets, with each pellet containing 20 mg trenbolone
acetate. The control cattle were not implanted. The dosages given in the heifer
studies were 0, 140, 200 and 300 mg. The dosages for the steer studies were 0,
40, 80, 140 and 200 mg. The heifers were implanted once with an implant period
of 63 days. The steers were implanted at day 0 and again at day 63. The
duration of the steer studies was 126 days.<P>
A randomized complete block design was used for all studies and the data were
pooled by Analysis of Variance to determine the significance of the effect of
trenbolone acetate implants on average daily gain and feed efficiency. For the
heifer data there was a significant (P&#60;0.05) dose effect on average daily
gain and feed efficiency with the maximum effect on both parameters at a dosage
of 200 mgs (table 1). For the steer data there was a significant (P&#60;0.05)
improvement in feed efficiency with the best response at 140 mgs (table 2).<P>
These data are sufficient to support the claims and dosage as outlined in
sections 2 and 3 above and no  adverse  reactions which affected  animal safety
were reported during  the effectiveness studies described  above.<p>

<b>5. ANIMAL SAFETY<P>
A. Study 1</b><P>
A drug tolerance study was conducted by Professor H. Zucker at the Institute
for Physiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Munich, Munich,
West Germany. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of an
exaggerated dose. The test animals were young heifer calves weighing
approximately 140 pounds. There were three calves in each treatment group. The
dosages used were control, 140 mg trenbolone acetate and 3500 mg trenbolone
acetate. The 3500 mg dose is 17.5 times the recommended dosage of 200 mg
trenbolone acetate. Ten (10) weeks after implantation the calves were
sacrificed. The parameters measured were clinical observations, gross necropsy,
histology, clinical chemistry, hematology and organ weights. The high level
(3500 mg) of trenbolone acetate caused abnormal development of the clitoris and
reduction in the weight of the thymus. A reduction in ovary weights was seen in
all treated calves. The calves tolerated this exaggerated dosage with minimal
adverse effects noted. These effects included proliferation of uterine
glandular tissues in some of the treated animals. This effect would be
predicted based on the hormonal activity of the compound.<P>
<b>B. Pivotal Study</b><P>
A target Animal Safety study was conducted by Dr. N.L. Roberts, Huntingdon
Research Centre, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England. The purpose of the study
was to assess the safety to beef cattle of trenbolone acetate given
subcutaneously as an ear implant. Twenty-four (eight per group) yearling cattle
weighing approximately 500 pounds at the initiation of the study were given the
following dosages of trenbolone acetate: control (no implant), 200 mg and 1000
mg per animal. There were four (4) steers and four (4) heifers in each of the
three treatment groups. The cattle were reimplanted after 63 days and the study
was terminated after 126 days. The parameters measured were clinical signs,
animal health, body weights, clinical biochemistry, and carcass grading.<P>
It was concluded that the treatment of beef cattle with trenbolone acetate by
subcutaneous implantation on two occasions (with an interval of 63 days) at 200
mg or 1000 mg per head, did not result in any adverse effects on clinical
health. Bodyweight gains were increased in comparison with controls. Carcass
weights were heavier for the treated cattle and there were no adverse effects
on carcass quality. Haematological and biochemical parameters remained within
normal limits.<P>
<b>6. HUMAN SAFETY<P>
A. Toxicity Studies</b><P>
A rat oral toxicity study to determine reproductive effects was conducted by
Dr. Brian Hunter, Huntington Research Centre, Huntington, England. The object
of the study was to assess the toxicity of trenbolone acetate when administered
in the diets of rats which were derived from dams treated with trenbolone
acetate during premating, mating, gestation and lactation periods. The study
was divided into a "reproductive phase" dealing with the reproductive
performance of F0 generation covering a period from inception to weaning of the
litters of the F0 generation. The "main phase" of the study was with the F1
generation and covered a 13 week period after weaning. In the reproductive
phase there were 24 rats (12 males and 12 females) per treatment group for a
total of 120 rats. During the main phase there were 50 rats (25 males and 25
females) per treatment group for a total of 250 rats. The dietary levels of
trenbolone acetate were 0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 ppm.<P>
The results of the study were as follows:<P>
<b>Reproductive phase:</b><P>
During the premating period a slightly lower body weight gain associated with a
lower food intake was recorded for adult males treated at 10 ppm. There were no
treatment related effects on the reproductive performance of animals treated
with trenbolone acetate and no treatment related differences in litter size,
litter weight, pup size or mortality.<P>
<b>Main phase:</b><P>
At the 10 ppm level, a higher food intake with an associated higher body weight
gain in females was recorded. A lower body weight gain in males was recorded at
the 10 ppm level. The 10 ppm level also produced higher serum alkaline
phosphatase levels, higher absolute and relative liver weights in females 4
weeks after weaning only, lower seminal vesicle weights 4 weeks after weaning
(not associated with any morphological change) and at week 13 the seminal
vesicle weights were similar to those of the controls. At the 5 ppm level, a
higher food intake with an associated higher body weight gain in females was
observed. The 5 ppm level produced a lower weight gain in males. The 5 ppm
level also produced lower relative seminal vesicle weights 4 weeks after
weaning (not associated with any morphological change) but at week 13 the
seminal vesicle weights were similar to those of the controls. At 2 ppm a
higher food intake with an associated higher body weight gain in females was
observed, a lower weight gain was observed in males. At 1 ppm a lower weight
gain was observed in males.<P>
The treatments produced an increased weight gain in females receiving 2, 5, or
10 ppm associated with an increased food intake. Although a lower weight gain
was produced in all treated males, in the absence of a dose relationship this
finding must be regarded as equivocal. Based on the above findings, it was
concluded that 1 ppm probably represents a no effect level for trenbolone
acetate in rats.<P>
Trenbolone acetate was fed to mice in a long term chronic feeding study by Dr.
Brian Hunter, Huntington Research Centre, Huntington, England. The purpose of
the study was to assess the potential tumorgenicity of trenbolone acetate on
mice. 640 mice were started on the study and the female mice were fed for up to
96 weeks and the male mice were fed for up to 104 weeks. Trenbolone acetate was
mixed into the diet and fed at levels of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0 ppm.
There were 128 mice (64 males and 64 females) in each treatment group at the
beginning of the experiment. There were no significant differences in all
parameters measured in this study except for:<P>
<ul>
<li>inhibition of ovulation and uteri with a histological appearance consistent
with diestrus among females killed after 13 weeks of treatment.<P>
<li>macroscopic lesions associated with the following histopathological
changes:<P>
<ol>
<li>significant increases in hepatic proliferative lesions (neoplasia and
hyperplasia) in males and females and an increase in hepatocyte vacuolation in
males.
<li>a marginal increase in nephritis in females. 
<li>reduction in splenic haemopoietic activity in females
<li>cystically dilated ducts and/or abscess of the female preputial glands.
</ol>
</ul><P>
The significant increase in the macrosopic lesions was treatment related with
the highest incidence at the highest dose (100 ppm) level. The Cancer
Assessment Committee of the Center for Veterinary Medicine examined this
chronic study in the mouse. The Committee concluded that the effects observed
were a manifestation of the well documented hormonal effects of some naturally
occurring and synthetic anabolic steroids in a recognized target tissue.
Support for this opinion was also derived from data which suggest that
trenbolone acetate is not mutagenic (see summary of mutagenic study
reports).<P>
The potential toxicity of prolonged administration of trenbolone acetate to
rats following <i>in utero</i>&#160; exposure was studied by Dr. Brian Hunter,
Huntington Research Centre, Huntington, England. The purpose of the study was
to evaluate the potential toxicity and tumorgenicity of trenbolone acetate when
administered in the diet of rats derived from dams that have themselves
received trenbolone acetate. Seven hundred twenty rats were randomly assigned
to one of six treatments for the <i>in utero</i>&#160; phase of the study. Six
hundred rats were used for the main phase of the study (lifetime study of F1
generation). These rats were randomly selected from the litters produced in the
<i>in utero</i>&#160; phase. Trenbolone acetate was mixed into the diets of the rats
and fed continuously at levels of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 16.0, and 50.0 ppm. During
the reproductive phase of the study there were no overt signs of a reaction to
treatment with trenbolone acetate exhibited by parent animals. Rats of the F0
generation receiving trenbolone acetate at a level of 1 ppm or greater appeared
to show a general treatment related impairment of reproductive performance. The
numbers of pups per litter were reduced in comparison with the controls among
females receiving 16 or 50 ppm. At day 4 the anogenital distance of pups of the
50 ppm group was noted to be similar for both males and females, thereby making
sexual distinction difficult. The major findings at termination of the main
phase of the study were in the sex related characteristics. These changes were
seen in the majority of females receiving 50 or 16 ppm and these changes
included coarse male-like fur, perineal hair loss, prominent pudendum, small
ovaries, uterus pale and containing viscous fluid and cervix not palpable.
Trenbolone acetate was noted to have a emasculating effect on treated males.
The incidence and severity of these findings was treatment related. The
incidence of certain aging changes appeared to be reduced in females receiving
50 ppm. Male rats receiving 50 ppm appeared to have an increase of small
adrenals and small pituitaries in comparison with the controls. Significantly
low prostate, testes, and kidney weights for males receiving 50 ppm were
considered to be the result of treatment with trenbolone acetate. Prostate and
testes weight of males receiving 16 ppm were also significantly low in
comparison with the controls. Females receiving 50 ppm had significantly low
adrenal and ovary weights. Significant microscopic findings included absent
corpora lutea, inflammation and modification of the vagina, inflammation,
luminal dilation and decreased endometrial thickness of the uterus, clitoral
enlargement and development of clitoral bone in the females. Testicular,
prostatic and vesicular atropic changes were noted in the male rats. In the 50
ppm treatment group the female rats had increased urinary bladder calculi,
increased incidence of ground glass hepatocytes in the liver, increased
incidence of Harderianisiation of the lachrymal glands, decreased incidence of
mammary fibral adenomas, and decreased incidence of pituitary adenomas. This
study was also reviewed by the Cancer Assessment Committee of the Center for
Veterinary Medicine. On the basis of direct and ancillary evidence, the
committee concluded that the increased incidence in pancreatic islet cell
tumors are not the result of a carcinogenic effect of trenbolone acetate. Based
on these chronic lifetime rat and mouse studies the Cancer Assessment Committee
agreed that the application of a conservative safety factor to the non-observed
hormonal effect as proposed in the Center for Veterinary Medicines hormone
policy document was appropriate for the regulation of trenbolone acetate.<P>
Therefore the results of the animal feeding studies indicated that the
principal effects of trenbolone acetate were associated with the hormonal
activity of this compound. The critical studies for assessment of human food
safety, therefore was related to the determination of the lowest level that
would not produce hormonal effects in a female monkey model system.<P>
Trenbolone acetate was studied in a preliminary oral toxicity study in
Cynomolgus monkeys by Dr. Rodney Sortwell, Huntington Research Centre,
Huntington, England. The object of the study was to obtain preliminary
information relating to the toxicity of trenbolone acetate when administered by
oral gavage to young adult Cynomolgus monkeys. The monkeys were dosed once
daily for 8 weeks by oral gavage. Two pairs (1 male and 1 female in each pair)
of monkeys received trenbolone acetate at levels of 0.375 mg/kg per day or
1.875 mg/kg per day. These two dosages for a 4 kg. monkey consuming 300 gms of
dry diet per day would be equivalent to 5 or 25 ppm trenbolone acetate
respectively. A third pair of animals acted as the controls. After a period of
8 weeks the monkeys were killed and subjected to macroscopic examination
followed by microscopy of selected tissues. There were no mortalities during
the course of the study and there were no treatment related effects on clinical
signs, body weight or feed consumption. The males showed decreased prostate
weights and increased seminal vesicles and testes weights.<P>
A study to determine the hormonal no effect dose level for trenbolone acetate
in the female Rhesus Macaque was conducted by Dr. David Hess at the Oregon
Regional Primate Research Center, Beaverton, Oregon. The purpose of the study
was to determine the hormonal no effect dosage of trenbolone acetate in a
representative female primate. Trenbolone acetate was administered in the diet
for 3 estrous cycles or a maximum of 122 days to 3 groups of 6 mature female
monkeys at 60, 240 and 960 &#181;g/day. Blood samples were obtained on a daily basis
from all animals during a pretreatment menstruaI cycle, at 3 day intervals
during the first 2 treatment menstrual cycles and daily during the last
treatment menstrual cycle or 30 days. Serum concentrations of estradiol,
progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
were determined by radioimmunoassay. The largest dose resulted in maximum
average serum levels of 2.3 ng/ml of 17b - trenbolone and this dose may have
inhibited gonadotropin secretion and ovarian function in 3 of 16 reproductive
cycles. We conclude that trenbolone had no effect at the mid and low dose
although the inhibitory effects of orally administered trenbolone on the
reproductive parameters studied in these females were marginal, at least in
comparison with progestational compounds. A conservative hormonal no effect
level was established at 40 microgram per kg per day (240 microgram per day via
the diet).<P>
<b>SUMMARY</b><P>
The results of these animal feeding studies indicated that the principal
effects of trenbolone acetate were associated with the hormonal activity of the
compound. The critical study for assessment of human food safety therefore was
related to the determination of the lowest level that would not produce
hormonal effects in a female monkey model system. The hormonal effects of
trenbolone acetate were as follows:<P>
<ul>
<li>Impairment of reproductive performance in rats.
<li>Female rats had coarse male-like fur, perineal hair loss, prominant pudendum,
small ovaries and cervix not palpable.
<li>Male rats receiving high doses had an increased incidence of small adrenals,
small pituitaries, and lower prostate, testes, and kidney weights.
<li>In the Rhesus monkey studies trenbolone acetate appeared to inhibit
gonadotropin secretion and ovarian function.
<li>The suppression of ovulation and cyclical ovarian activity was noted in some
studies.
</ul>
<P>
Based on these studies the hormonal no-effect level was established based on
the pivotal study conducted in the Rhesus monkey. A conservative hormonal
noeffect level was established at 40 microgram per kg per day (240 microgram per day
via the diet).<P>
<b>B. Mutagenic Potential Study Reports.</b><P>
An Ames metabolic activation test to assess the potential mutagenic effect of
trenbolone acetate, l7b estradiol and a 7:1 mixture of trenbolone with 17b
estradiol was conducted by Dr. David Hossack, Huntington Research Centre,
Huntington, England. In this <i>in vitro</i>&#160; assessment of the mutagenic
properties of the test compounds histadine dependent auxotrophic mutants of
<i>Salmonella typhimirium</i>&#160; were exposed to concentrations as high as l0,000
&#181;g/plate of each of the test materials. The strains were tested on histadine
deficient agar and the test material was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide. In a
parallel series of plates, rat liver microsomal fraction was added to the agar
to effect metabolic transformation of the test compound. After incubation for
72 hours at 37&#176; C, the numbers of revertant (histadine
independent) colonies were counted and compared with negative controls. No
evidence of bacteriostatic activity was observed at the dose levels tested.
Trenbolone acetate, 17b estradiol and the 7:1 mixture failed to show any
evidence of mutagenic potential in this bacterial system.<P>

A study was conducted by Dr. Margaret Richold at Huntington Research Centre,
Huntington England to assess the mutagenic potential of 17 beta
hydroxytrenbolone and 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone when orally administered to
rats. The mutagenic potential was assessed by examination of chromosome damage
in somatic and germinal metaphase cells. The somatic cells were examined from
the bone marrow and the germinal cells were spermatogonial cells. The natural
hormones estradiol and testosterone were used as reference control substances.
Mitomycin C, a known mutagen, was used as the positive control. The treatment
compounds were administered to rats by intragastric intubation at a single dose
of 100 mg/kg body weight in a single dose or the compounds were administered by
intragastric intubation in four equal dosages separated by intervals of 24
hours at total doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight. After administration of 
17 beta hydroxytrenbolone, 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone, estradiol or testosterone
the group mean aberrant metaphase counts in both tissues were similar to the
value observed with the control group. It was concluded that despite the
apparent negative activity of 17B-hydroxy- and 17A-hydroxytrenbolone in the <i>in
vivo</i>&#160; cytogenetic studies, study limitations of a single dose <i>in vivo</i>&#160; limited
the interpretation of the negative findings.<P>

A study was conducted by Dr. Margaret Richold at Huntington Research Centre,
Huntington England to determine the mutagenic effect of 17 beta
hydroxytrenbolone and 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone on cultured human lymphocytes.
The two compounds were tested <i>in vitro</i>&#160; to determine whether they cause
chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes. The test compounds
produced chromosome aberrations comparable with the respective control values
in the absence of metabolic activation or in the presence of metabolic
activation. It was concluded that despite the apparent lack of
treatment-related increase in chromosome aberrations, the dosing schedule <i>in
vitro</i>&#160; limited the interpretation of the negative findings.<P>
The synthetic hormones 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone and 17 beta hydroxytrenbolone
and the natural hormones testosterone and estradiol were tested for mutagenic
potency in an <i>in vitro</i>&#160;  mouse lymphoma cell L5178Y/TK assay. This study
was conducted by Dr. Margaret Richold at Huntington Research Centre,
Huntington, England.  With testosterone and estradiol, the criteria for a
positive mutagenic response were not fulfilled.  A weak but reproducible
positive response was recorded in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay for
both 17B-hydroxy- and 17A-hydroxytrenbolone.<P>
The Ames metabolic activation test to asses the potential mutagenic effect of 17
alpha hydroxytrenbolone, 17 beta hydroxytrenbolone, and 17 alpha estradiol was
conducted by Dr. Margaret Richold, Huntington Research Centre, Huntington,
England. Five strains of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>&#160; were tested. 17 alpha
hydroxytrenbolone was toxic towards the tester strains at 5,000 microgram per
plate dose level, therefore 500 microgram per plate was chosen as the top dose
level in the mutation test. 17 beta hydroxytrenbolone was slightly toxic
towards the tester strains at 5,000 microgram per plate. Therefore, an
intermediary dose level of 1500 microgram per plate was chosen as the top dose
level in the mutation test. 17 alpha estradiol was not toxic toward the tester
strains at the chosen dose levels, therefore 5,000 microgram per plate was
chosen as the top dose level in the mutation test. No substantial increases in
the revertant colony numbers of any of the 5 strains were observed following
treatment with 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone, 17 beta hydroxytrenbolone, or 17
alpha estradiol at any dose level either in the presence or absence of liver
microsomal fraction. It was concluded that no evidence of mutagenic potential
was seen in any of the compounds tested in this bacterial test system.<P>
Dr. Margaret Richold at Huntington Research Centre, Huntington, England
conducted a mutagenicity study with diethylstibestrol, 17 beta hydroxy
trenbolone, 17 beta estradiol and 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone using the mouse
lymphoma L5178Y cell mutation test. In this <i>in vitro</i>&#160; system it is
possible to detect and quantitate forward mutation from a wild cell type. The
four compounds were found to be toxic to the L5178Y cells: diethylstibestrol
between concentrations of 5 and 12.5 micrograms per ml, 17 beta
hydroxytrenbolone between 15 and 65 microgram per ml, 17 beta estradiol at 90
microgram per ml and 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone between 22.5 and 45 microgram
per ml. Treatment of the cells with diethylstibestrol and 17 beta
hydroxytrenbolone produced twofold increases in mutation frequency at cell
survival levels of greater than 20&#37; relative to the control in each case. Both,
17 beta estradiol and 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone also induced
two-fold increases in mutation frequency, however, at cell survivals of less
than 20&#37;s relative to the controls. The responses were dose-dependent, and the
mutagenic activity in each case occurred in the presence of S9 metabolic
activation. It is concluded that the assay results are indicative of the
mutagenic potential of diethylstilbestrol, 17B-hydroxytrenbolone,
17B-estradiol, and 17A-hydroxytrenbolone.<P>
In assessment of the mutagenic potential of 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone in
mammalian cells <i>in vitro</i>&#160; using the Chinese hamster ovary/HPRT locus
assay was conducted by Dr. L. M. Henderson, Huntington Research Centre,
Huntington, England. This study using a gene mutation assay in cultured
mammalian cells was conducted to determine the potential mutagenicity of 17
alpha hydroxytrenbolone. The compound was tested in the presence and absence of
a source of supplementary metabolic activation on two separate occasions. This
test determines the compounds ability to induce forward mutation at the
functionally homozygous hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)
locus in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Treatment with 17 alpha
hydroxytrenbolone induced dose-related cytotoxicity in CHO cells in both tests
in the absence and presence of exogenous metabolic activation. It is concluded
that the results were suggestive of a possible minor, though non-reproducible,
mutagenic effect resulting from exposure of CHO cells to 17 alpha
hydroxytrenbolone, in the absence of S9 metabolizing activity. The mean
mutation frequencies induced by the two treatment conditions (100 and 150
mcg/ml) were elevated 3.33- and 2.22-fold, respectively. However, in view of
the fact that (a) the reported results were not statistically significant, and
(b) the mutagenic responses were not reproducible in an independent assay, it
was concluded that the mutagenic activity caused by 17A-hydroxytrenbolone in
this assay system was not considered substantial.<P>
A BHK cell transformation assay on Trenbolone acetate was performed by
Huntingdon Research Centre, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England. The results of
the BHK 21 cell transformation assay indicated that under the assay conditions
as performed BHK 21 cells were transformed by Trenbolone acetate both in the
absence and presence of exogenous, S9 metabolizing activity. Furthermore, the
induction of BHK 21 cell transformation was reproducible, occurring in two
independent studies, both with and without S9 activation.<P>
<b>C. Reproduction Study Reports</b><P>
A teratology study was conducted in the pregnant rat by Dr. Penny James,
Huntington Research Center, Huntington, England. A preliminary study was
conducted on 24 female rats given trenbolone acetate by intragastric intubation
at levels of 0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg/kg per day. The treatments were started on
day 6 of pregnancy and continued daily up to and including day 15 of pregnancy.
In this preliminary study the pregnant rats showed no overt adverse effects on
maternal or litter parameters following treatment. For the main teratology
study 80 female rats were treated with trenbolone acetate at levels of 0, 5, 10
and 20 mg/kg per day. Treatment was by intragastric intubation commencing on
day 6 of pregnancy and continued daily up to and including day 15 of pregnancy.
The animals were killed on day 20 of pregnancy, litter values determined were
crown-rump length and anogenital distances measured and fetuses examined for
skeletal and visceral anomalies. In this teratology study, treatment at 20
mg/kg per day was associated with hair loss in 15/20 animals, relaxed bodytone,
slightly increased salivation and retardation of body weight gain. Animals
receiving 10 mg/kg per day showed hair loss in 9/20 animals, slightly increased
salivation and slight retardation of weight gain over the dosing period. Litter
parameters as assessed by numbers of viable young, post implantation loss,
litter and mean pup weight did not suggest any adverse effects of treatment.
Embryonic and fetal development as assessed by the incidence of major
malformations, minor visceral anomalies and skeletal variance did not appear
adversely effected. There was a slightly higher incidence of minor skeletal
anomalies at 20 mg/kg per day. The difference from control values was not
statistically significant and there was no increase in any specific anomaly to
account for the difference. For male fetuses preserved in Bouin's solution,
there was an apparent slight dosage related trend for reducted anogenital
distance. The difference at 20 mg/kg per day attained borderline statistical
significance. No associated decrease in fetal weight or crown-rump length was
observed. Male fetuses preserved in alcohol did not show the same degree of
differences in mean values although individual ranges in respect of high and
low values were lower at 20 mg/kg per day than for controls. The mean
anogenital distances for females were comparable for all groups. If the
differences in male anogenital distance are considered real, then they must be
of an extremely subtle nature since for fetuses preserved in Bouin's only one
male in each test group had an anogenital distance which fell within the total
individual range for females similarly preserved. Likewise only one male fetus
preserved in alcohol at 5 mg/kg per day and 2 at 20 mg/kg per day fell within
the total individual range for females similarly preserved.<P>
The effect of trenbolone acetate on reproductive function of multiple
generations in the rat was studied by Dr. Penny James at Huntington Research
Centre, Huntington, England. Over 700 male and female rats were fed in this
study to assess the effect of trenbolone acetate on growth and reproductive
performance of the rat through two (2) consecutive generations. Trenbolone
acetate was fed in the diet at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 3.0 and 18.0 ppm. The
test diets were fed to F0 males for 9 weeks and F0 females for 2 two weeks
prior to mating and then through to termination of the study. Two F1
generations were selected, reared and mated. One was treated continuously at
the same dietary concentrations as the F0 generation and one was removed from
exposure to trenbolone acetate at three weeks of age and remained untreated
throughout. Treatment with trenbolone acetate at 18 ppm was associated with the
following effects:<P>
<ul>
<li>Generally higher weekly body weights effecting F0 and F1 treated males and
females, and the females of the F1 untreated generation.<P>
<li>A depression in mean body weight gain during gestation affecting both matings
of F0 generation.<P>
<li>Signs of coarseness of the hair coat and discoloration of the skin affecting
F0 and treated F1 females.<P>
<li>Clitoral prominence in treated female F1 offspring and to a lesser extent
in those where treatment was withdrawn at three weeks of age. Similar
effects were observed in treated F2 offspring from treated F1 parents but
not in offspring of the untreated F1 generation.<P>
<li>The presence of occlusive strands in the vagina and/or precocious
incomplete vaginal opening affecting treated F1 pups and F2 pups from the
treated F1 generation.<P>
<li>A delay in the occurrence of testicular descent affecting F2 pups from the
treated F1 generation.<P>
<li>A marked reduction in pregnancy rate effecting the second mating the F0
generation and the treated F1 generation.<P>
<li>An increase in pre-coital time for the second mating of the F0 generation
and the treated F1 generation.<P>
<li>A marginal extension of the duration of gestation affecting the F0
generation and the treated F1 generation.<P>
<li>A marked increase in the incidence of extended parturition in total
litter loss in the treated F1 generation and a significant increase in the
percentage of males per litter.<P>
<li>Effects on litter parameters, principally lower litter size and litter
weight at birth, or 20 day sacrifice at both matings of the F0 and for the
treated F1 generation and increased post implantation/pre-birth loss for
the F0 and treated F1 generation.<P>
<li>At terminal autopsy an increase in the incidence of depressions in the fore
stomach epithelium affecting F0 and F1 males was observed.<P>
<li>Among organ weights of adults consistent findings included a significant
reduction in seminal vesicle/prostate weight in F0 and F1 treated males and
an increase in mean ovary weight among F0 and F1 treated females.<P>
<li>Among organ weights of offspring at 6 weeks, F1 and F2 male pups showed a
significant decrease in the weight of seminal vesicle/prostate, testes, and
epididymides. F1 and F2 female pups showed reduction of adrenal weight.<P>
<li>The laboratory examinations relating to the second mating of the F0
generation (teratology phase) revealed a significant reduction in
anogenital distance among male fetuses and a marginal increase in the
incidence of skeletal variance.
</ul>
<P>
The only apparent effects of treatment with trenbolone acetate at 0.5 ppm
were:<P>
<ul>
<li>Higher group mean body weights for males of the F0 generation.<P>
<li>A slight but not statistically significant delay in the mean age of
vaginal opening of F1 pups and F2 pups of the F1 treated generation;
subsequent mating performance and resulting litter parameters were
comparable with those of controls.<P>
<li>Among organ weights of the offspring at 6 weeks treated F1 and F2 male
pups from the treated parents showed a statistically significant decrease
in seminal vesicles/prostate weight with the F2 males additionally showing
a significant decrease of weight of epididymides.<P>
</ul>
Trenbolone acetate exerted a marked effect at 18 ppm and some effect at 3 ppm
when considered in terms of reproductive performance of the two generations of
rats examined in this study. At the lowest dose level examined (0.5 ppm) there
was a slight delay in the mean, age of vaginal opening and at 6 weeks of age
effects were seen on the weight of the epididymides and/or seminal
vesicles/prostate. Effects appeared more marked in the F2 pups than had been
observed in the F1 pups of a comparable age. However, in terms of overall
reproductive performance, trenbolone acetate exerted no effect at 0.5 ppm. The
reproductive performance of all groups of F1 animals following withdrawal from
treatment showed no marked difference from that of the control group.<P>
Because the hormonal no effect level could not be determined in the proceeding
multiple generation rat study, a supplementary study on the effect of
trenbolone acetate on pregnancy of the rat and development of the offspring was
conducted by Dr. Penny James at Huntington Research Centre, Huntington,
England. At the initiation of this study trenbolone acetate was fed to 270 male
and female rats at levels of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 3.0 and 18.0 ppm. The rats
received the test diet at the above concentrations for 2 weeks prior to mating
and throughout the mating period, gestation and lactation.<P>
The adult males were sacrificed as the majority of litters approached weaning.
Male pups were sacrificed on day 22 post-partum. All animals were subjected to
post mortem examination. The following organs of all male pups were weighed
prior to preservation: testes, seminal vesicles with prostate, and
epididymides. On day 24 post partum the female pups and the parent females were
sacrificed.<P>
Treatment with trenbolone acetate at 18 ppm was associated with:<P>
<ul>
<li>Slightly higher mean weekly body weight of F0 females but lower body
weight gain during gestation and slightly lower weight gain of males over
the last three weeks of treatment.<P>
<li>22/29 F0 females showed clitoral prominence at autopsy and all F1 female
offspring were similarly affected from approximately 3 weeks of age.<P>
<li>A statistically significant extension and duration of gestation.<P>
<li>4/29 F0 females showed total litter loss.<P>
<li>Effects on litter parameters included reduced litter size, lower litter
weight, marginally higher pup mortality and higher mean pup weight.<P>
<li>F1 males at 22 days of age showed lower testicular weight and higher mean
weight for seminal vesicles/prostate.<P>
Treatment at 3 ppm was associated with:<P>
<ul>
<li>Slightly higher mean weekly body weight for females and slightly lower weight
for males in the three weeks prior to termination.<P>
<li>A marginal extension in duration of gestation.<P>
<li>Effects on litter parameters included reduced litter size, marginally higher
pup mortality and mean pup weight.<P>
<li>F1 males again showed lower testicular weight and higher mean seminal
vesicle/prostate weight.<P>
</ul>
Treatment at 0.1, 0.3, and 0..5 ppm was associated with:<P>
<ul>
<li>Slightly higher mean weekly body weight for females.<P>
<li>Marginal differences in litter parameters as previously observed.<P>
</ul>
</ul>
It is concluded that there is no deleterious effect of trenbolone acetate upon
the weights of the testes, seminal vesicles with prostate or epididymides at
the dosage level of 0.5 ppm. Therefore the hormonal no effect level for the rat
is determined to be a dosage level of 0.5 ppm in the diet. The toxicological no
effect level of trenbolone acetate as determined in these rat reproduction
studies is not lower than that established as the hormonal no effect level in
the Rhesus monkey.<P>
<b>SUMMARY</b><P>
In the teratology study litter parameters as assessed by numbers of viable
young, post implantation loss, litter and mean pup weight did not suggest any
adverse effects of treatment. Embryonic and fetal development as assessed by
the incidence of major malformations, minor visceral anomalies and skeletal
variance was not adversely effected. The effect of trenbolone acetate on
reproductive function of multiple generations in the rat showed the same
hormonal effects as indicated under the toxicity studies summary of this same
section. A conservative hormonal no-effect level for the rat was determined to
be a dosage level of 0.5 ppm in the diet. This no-effect level is higher than
that determined as the hormonal no-effect level in the Rhesus monkey.
Therefore, the calculation of the safe concentration of total trenbolone
acetate residues was based on the hormonal no-effect level as determined in the
female monkey model system.<P>
<b>D. Pharmacology of Trenbolone Acetate</b><P>
The effect of trenbolone acetate on protein synthesis in the rat was studied by
B.G. Vernon and P.J. Buttery. These studies were published in the  British
Journal of Nutrition , Vol. 36, pg. 575, 1976 and Vol. 40, pg. 563, 1978.
The rats were injected with trenbolone acetate (800 &#181;g/kg body weight) daily
via the neck skin fold. The rats were sacrificed 7 and 14 days after initiation
of treatment. Trenbolone acetate given subcutaneously to female rats increased
their growth rate compared with that of the placebo treated controls. The
increased growth rate of the trenbolone acetate treated rats was not a
consequence of an increased water retention. The trenbolone acetate treated
rats had significantly higher (P  0.01) total carcass nitrogen content but the
total carcass fat content decreased by a nonsignificant 8.3&#37;. There was
evidence of a time lag in the response of the fractional synthetic rate of
certain individual tissues to trenbolone acetate. The fractional synthetic
rates of the uterus and skeletal muscle mixed tissue proteins were
significantly reduced in the trenbolone acetate treated rats. The measured
reduction in fractional synthetic rates was concluded to reflect true changes
in the synthetic rate rather than a result of an alteration in the specific
activity of the tyrosine pool used for protein synthesis.<P>
An investigation of the androgenic and anabolic effects of trenbolone acetate
was conducted by Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, W. Germany. This study was conducted by
Dr. Schroder in castrated male rats. Seventy-five castrated male rats were
given 10 daily doses of trenbolone acetate at 0, 0.02, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/per
animal per day. The rats were treated subcutaneously. One day after the end of
treatment the rats were killed and the musculus levator ani, the ventral
prostate and the seminal vesicle were removed and the weight of these organs
determined. The increase in the weight of the musculus levator ani is a measure
of the anabolic effect of a substance and the increase in the weight of the
ventral prostate and seminal vesicle a measure of its androgenic effect. In
this study the androgenic and anabolic effects of trenbolone acetate were
compared against a reference preparation of testosterone. The anabolic and
androgenic effect of trenbolone acetate was about 5 times stronger than
testosterone. At the same time, a small study was conducted to investigate the
estrogenic effect of trenbolone acetate. The increase in weight of the uterus
of castrated infantile rats was measured after treatment with estrogen active
substances. Forty female rats were treated for four days with trenbolone
acetate subcutaneously at daily levels of 0, 0.2, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/animal. On the
fifth day the rats were killed and the weight of the uterus determined. These
weights were compared with those of rats which served as controls or were
treated with 17 beta estradiol. In this study trenbolone acetate demonstrated
essentially no estrogenic activity being at least 1,000 times less active than
17 beta estradiol.<P>
<b>SUMMARY</b><P>
The hormonal activity of trenbolone acetate can be divided into the anabolic
antigonadotropic and androgenic effects. The anabolic effects of the compound
relate to its ability to increase animal production through the improved
efficiency of utilization of amino acids and subsequently increased protein
accumulation inside muscle cells with the overall effect of improving average
daily gain and improved feed efficiency in cattle. This anabolic effect has
been well documented with slow release ear implants containing a total dose of
140 to 200 mg trenbolone acetate in cattle. This effective dose is gradually
absorbed from the ear implant to give the desired effects on improvement in
animal production. The antigonadotropic effect includes the inhibition of
ovulation and testicular growth. A level of 3.0 ppm trenbolone acetate in the
diet of rats will produce slight antigonadotropic effects (hormonal no-effect
level in rats was determined to be 0.5 ppm in the diet). Levels of 960
micrograms trenbolone acetate per day in the diet of the Rhesus monkey will
produce an antigonadotropic effect. 240 microgram per day via the diet was
established as the hormonal no-effect level in the Rhesus monkey. The
androgenic activity of trenbolone acetate relates to its ability to stimulate
the development of secondary sex characteristics of the male similar to the
hormone testosterone. The androgenic effect on females would include coarse
male-like hair, prominent pudendum and small ovaries. In the male the
androgenic effect is measured by increases in the weight of the prostate and
seminal vesicle. In cattle, females will demonstrate some androgenic effect of
trenbolone acetate when an extremely high level of 3500 mg of trenbolone
acetate is implanted. At the highest recommended dose of 200 mg trenbolone
acetate no androgenic effects were seen.<P>
<b>E. Calculation of the safe concentration of total trenbolone acetate
residues.</b><P>
The results of the animal feeding studies indicated that the principle effects
of trenbolone acetate were associated with the hormonal activity of the
compound. The critical studies for assessment of human food safety therefore
were related to the determination of the lowest level that would not produce
hormonal effects in a female monkey model system. The hormonal no effect level
was determined to be 40 &#181;g/kg in the non human primate female.<P>
From these data the safe concentration for residues was calculated to be 50 ppb
in muscle, 100 ppb in liver, 300 ppb in kidney and 400 ppb in fat. The total
average trenbolone acetate in beef liver was determined to be 43.8 ppb at 15
days after implantation and 50.5 ppb after 30 days. The residues in muscle,
kidney and fat were much lower, see Section 6 F.<P>
The safe concentration for residue of trenbolone acetate exceeds the total
residues found in muscle, liver, kidney and fat at 15 and 30 days after
implantation. It would not be expected that potential misuse of the product
would result in tissue residue in excess of the safe concentration. Therefore,
no withholding period prior to slaughter is indicated.<P>
<b>F. Residue depletion and metabolism studies.</b><P>
The studies conducted on trenbolone acetate have resulted in determination of
the total residues in the edible tissues of treated animals. These studies were
conducted using tritiated trenbolone acetate. Studies of the biotransformation
of the compound have been conducted with determination that in the liver of the
bovine, there is production of 17 alpha hydroxytrenbolone whereas in the other
tissues the primary metabolite is the 17 beta hydroxytrenbolone. The residues
exist both free and in conjugated form.<P>
The pivotal tissue residue study was conducted by Dr. D. R. Hawkins at
Huntington Research Centre, Huntington, England. The purpose of the study was
to determine the tissue residues of total radioactivity at 15 and 30 days after
implantation with tritiated trenbolone acetate. 12 calves received subcutaneous
implants in the ear containing 200 mg of tritiated trenbolone acetate. Six
animals were sacrificed at each of 15 and 30 days after implantation. Blood
samples were taken at intervals between dosing and sacrifice. At sacrifice the
liver, kidneys and samples of muscle, fat and bile were taken for analysis.
Concentrations of radioactivity and plasma were fairly constant during the
experimental period, with mean levels of 4 to 5 ng/ml. Tissue concentrations of
radioactivity were similar at 15 or 30 days. The highest concentrations were
found in the liver (means of 43.8 and 50.5 ng/g at 15 and 30 days
respectively). Lower concentrations were found in the kidneys (16-22 ng/g) and
muscle and fat (2 to 3 ng/g). High concentrations of radioactivity in bile
(means of 1,163 and 741 ng/ml) indicate its importance in excretion of this
compound. (See table 3).<P>
Comparison of total and nonvolatile radioactivity concentrations showed that
there was only a small amount of tritiated water produced. About 10&#37; of the
radioactivity in the liver samples was extracted by diethyl ether or ethyl
acetate and this proportion increased to about 20 - 30&#37; following incubations
with betaglucuronidase, indicating the presence of a glucuronid(s) as a
metabolite(s).<P>

The metabolites of trenbolone acetate in the bile of the cow and the rat were
studied by Dr. J. Pottier <i>et al</i>&#160; at the Research Center of Roussel Uclaf,
Romanville, France and the Institute for Research in Animal Diseases,
Berkshire, England. The bile transformations of trenbolone acetate,
17b-acetoxy-estra-4,9,11-triene-3-one (T.B.A.), in the bovine may differ from
those in the rat which is the species used to determine its toxicity.
Therefore, for reasons of public health, the metabolism in these animals
species was compared. For this purpose, tritiated trenbolone acetate was
injected intravenously to a heifer or to rats after catheterization of the
common bile duct and the structures of metabolites were identified in the bile
which is the major route of excretion in both species. For this purpose,
6,7(3)-H-T.B.A. was i.v. injected to a heifer or to rats and bile was
collected for 24 hr. In both species the bile was by far the major route of
excretion. The 3-keto trienic compounds accounted for the main part of
extractable radioactivity before and after hydrolysis, showing the strong
biological stability of this structure. In both species T.B.A. undergoes an
extensive hydrolysis to l7beta hydroxy-estra-4, 9,11-triene-3-one (T.B.OH) and
unchanged compound was not detected, but subsequent major metabolic pathways
are different. In the rat, oxidation of the 17b-hydroxyl to estra-4, 9,
11-triene-3, 17-dione (T.B.O.) and hydroxylation in 16a-position are the major
routes. The three main metabolites are T.B.OH and the 16a-hydroxylated
derivatives of T.B.OH and T.B.O. In the heifer, 17a-epimerization is the major
pathway and the main metabolite is by far the 17a-hydroxy-4,9,11-triene-3-one
(Epi-T.B.OH). In both species, the other metabolites, resulting either from
hydroxylation in 1, 2, 6a or 16b-positions, or from aromatization of the A ring,
were minor products. Thus, in the bovine species, the major pathway is similar
to those of testosterone or 17b-estradiol which are mainly excreted as their
aepimers. This epimerization strongly decreases the biological potency of T.B.OH, 
as in the case of natural 17b-hormones, and leads to a detoxification of
the possible residues in tissues used for human comsumption. See Table 4
showing the relative amounts of the T.B.A. metabolites excreted in rats and
cattle.<P>

<b>G. Tolerance for marker residue.</b><P>
The study of the total tissue residues 15 and 30 days after administration of
tritiated trenbolone, was conducted as discussed under F. above. The results of
the 15 day total residues were such that they did not exceed the previous
estimates of residues at 60 days. The highest concentration of radioactivity
was found in the liver with a mean of 48 ppb. Lower concentrations were found
in the kidney, muscle and fat. With the total residues at 15 days post
implantation being of adequate safety margin when compared to the most
sensitive toxicological or hormonal effects and the established principle that
it is not expected that any animals will be intentionally slaughtered within 15
days after implantation, a zero withdrawal period was established. Therefore,
identification of a marker residue was not attempted.<P>
<b>H. Withdrawal Period.</b><P>
As discussed above no withdrawal period is required following the use of
trenbolone acetate.<P>
<b>I. Regulatory Method</b><P>
As discussed above no withdrawal time is required. Therefore, it is not
necessary to have a Regulatory Assay Method or a confirmatory assay method for
trenbolone acetate tissue residues.<P>
<b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that the data submitted in
support of this new animal drug application comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the act. The data demonstrates that Finaplix&#174;-H is
safe and effective to increase the rate weight gain and improve feed efficiency
in growing-finishing feedlot heifers. Finaplix&#174;-S is safe and
effective to improve feed efficiency in growing-finishing feedlot steers.<P>
The Center has also concluded that Finaplix&#174;-H and
Finaplix&#174;-S  are safe for over-the-counter (OTC) distribution.
Directions on labeling and packaging are adequate and ear implantation is a
common method of administration of this type product within the feedlot
industry. Producers who use this product can be expected to safely and
successfully accomplish implantation.  Further, there is no special need to
recognize a disease condition, the drug is not a "controlled substance," and
after implantation there is no need for medical monitoring or evaluation of the
treated animal.  Accordingly, prescription restriction of this product is not
warranted.<P>

<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product).   New target animal safety data, drug
effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.   Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.   If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.   For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an
<i>in 
 vivo </i>&#160; bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA
Policy Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the genetic product, Agri
Laboratories Ltd. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo
</i>&#160; bioequivalence study for Oxytetracycline HCl Soluble Powder.  The genetic
and pioneer products contain the same active ingredient and are water soluble
powders administered as oral solutions.   The genetic product contains no
inactive ingredients that may significantly affect the absorption of the active
ingredient.<p>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance</b><p>
The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.   Tolerances of 3 ppm in uncooked kidney and 1 ppm in uncooked muscle,
liver, fat, and skin are established for residues of oxytetracycline in
chickens and turkeys under 21 CFR 556.500(a).  A tolerance of 0.1 ppm in
uncooked edible tissues is established for residues of oxytetracycline in swine
under 21 CFR 556.500(b).<p>
<b>Withdrawal  Time</b><p>
When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalence study is
granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product.<p>
For oxytetracycline powder, a withdrawal period of zero has been established
for chickens.  A withdrawal period of 5 days is established for turkeys [21 CFR
520.1660(d)].  Oxytetracycline HCl soluble powder is not to be administered to
chickens or turkeys producing eggs for human consumption.   A withdrawal period
of 13 days is established for swine [21 CFR 520.1660(d)].<p>
<b>Regulatory  Method:</b><p>
The analytical method for the determination of oxytetracycline in tissues uses
a microbiological assay procedure.  This method is found in the <i>Antibiotic
Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues:  Methods, Reports. and
Protocols, </i>&#160;revised October 1968, National Center for Antibiotic and Insulin
Analysis, FDA, Washington, D.C. 20204.<p>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that  oxytetracycline  hydrochloride  when  used  under the
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled
indications.<p>

<br>
<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product). New target animal safety data, drug
effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not required for approval of an ANADA. An ANADA relies on the target animal
safety, drug effectiveness and human food safety data in the pioneer's new
animal drug application. Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the generic
product is bioequivalent to the pioneer. If bioequivalence is demonstrated
through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to establish
the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required. For certain
dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo
</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<br>
<br>
The generic product was the subject of an approved suitability petition
(92P-0057/CP1), in which the agency granted permission to The Upjohn Company to
file an ANADA for changes in dosage form and in strength, relative to the
pioneer product. The generic product is formulated as a solution, and the
pioneer product is formulated as a water soluble powder. The generic product is
formulated at 200 mg neomycin sulfate/mL, and the pioneer product is formulated
at 325 g neomycin sulfate/pound of product. The pioneer and generic products
will be administered as oral solutions in water or milk, at a dosage of 10 mg
neomycin sulfate per pound of body weight in divided doses for a maximum of 14
days.<br>
<br>
As a separate action, based upon the formulation characteristics of the pioneer
and generic products, The Upjohn Company was granted a waiver from conducting
an <i>in vivo </i> bioequivalence study. The pioneer and generic products will
be administered as oral solutions at the same dosage, and the generic product
does not contain any inactive ingredients that may significantly affect
absorption of the active ingredient.<br>
<br>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Tolerance for the marker residue</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product as well.<br>
<br>
A tolerance of 0.25 ppm has already been established for edible tissues of
calves and 0.15 ppm for milk (<B>21 CFR 556.430</B>). The tolerance of 0.25 ppm in
edible tissues also applies to swine, sheep, and goats.  The tolerance of 0.15
ppm for milk also applies to lactating goats.<br>
<br>
<b>Withdrawal times</b><br>
<b></b><br>
When a waiver of the <i>in vivo </i> bioequivalence study is granted, the
withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer product.<br>
<br>
The withdrawal periods which apply to the pioneer product (<B>21 CFR 558.20</B>), 30
days in cattle (excluding veal calves) and goats and 20 days in swine and
sheep, are likewise applicable to the generic product.<br>
<br>
<b>Regulatory Method</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The regulatory analytical method for detection of drug residues is a
microbiological test using a suspension of <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>.
The method, published by the Food and Drug Administration, is in "Antibiotic
Residues in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and
Protocols", revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974.<br>
<br>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and

3.	<B>DOSAGE FORM(S), ROUTE(S) OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE</B><P>

A.  Dosage Form<p>

Combicillin &#174  and Combicillin-AG &#174  are supplied in 100 mL or 
250 mL vials containing 150,000 units per mL of penicillin G benzathine 
and penicillin G procaine, each in aqueous suspension.<p>

B.  Route of Administration<p>

Horses:	Administered as a single intramuscular injection<br>
Cattle:	Administered as a single subcutaneous injection<p>

C.  Recommended Dosage<p>

Dogs:	1 mL per 10-25 lbs body weight or 6000 to 15,000 units of
		penicillin G procaine and penicillin G benzathine per lb of
		body weight<p>
Horses: 2 mL per 150 lb body weight or 2000 units penicillin G
		procaine and 2000 units penicillin G benzathine per pound
		of body weight.  This drug should not be used in horses intended for food.<p>

Cattle: 2 mL per 150 lb body weight or 2000 units penicillin G 
procaine(beef) and 2000 units penicillin G benzathine per pound of body 
weight. Treatment should be limited to two (2) doses.	Treatment should 
be repeated in 48 hours. Cattle should be withheld from slaughter for 
food use for 30 days following the last treatment.<p>

<B>4.  EFFECTIVENESS</B><p>

The combination product, penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G 
procaine was the subject of a final rule and was published in the 
Federal Register of February 16, 1979 (<B>44 FR 10059</B>).  The final rule 
amended the animal drug regulations (1) to indicate those portions which 
reflect the National Academy of Science-National Research Council, Drug 
Efficacy Study Group (NAS/NRC) evaluation of the product and (2) to 
specify the conditions of use for which approval of similar products 
need not include certain types of efficacy data, but may require 
submission of bioequivalence or similar data.
Anthony's product has been shown to be bioequivalent to the pioneer 
product, Bristol's Flo-Cillin &#174 , (NADA 65-169) which was approved as 
effective (as well as safe) in 1979.  The name and address of the 
investigator is:<p>

Diane Fagerberg<br>
Colorado Animal Research Enterprises, Inc.<br>
6200 East County Road 56<br>
Fort Collins, Colorado 80524<p>

Bioequivalency Study:<p>

The bioequivalence study was designed as a 20-animal crossover trial in 
steers (beef cattle).  The 20 test animals were randomized to two 
treatment groups after stratification for body weight.  Single, 
equivalent doses (600,000 IU/150 lbs body weight) of either the Test or 
the Reference product were administered subcutaneously to individuals in 
10-animal groups at each of two periods that were separated by a 28-day washout 
period.  No adverse reactions were observed during the study.  Blood 
samples were collected from each animal during each of the two periods 
prior to drug administration and 14 times post-dosing: at 20 min; 40 
min; 60 min; 80 min; 100 min; 120 min; 4 hr; 6 hr; 12 hr; 18 hr; 24 hr; 
48 hr; 72 hr; and 96 hr.  Serum was analyzed for penicillin G 
concentration by a cylinder-plate microbiological method using 
Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341a), with a limit of detection less than or equal to 0.025 
IU/mL.  The method used is based on the method described in the 
publication: "Antibiotic Residues-in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal 
Tissues: Methods, Reports and Protocols.", National Center for 
Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, Food and Drug Administration, Dept.  of 
Health and Human Services, Washington DC 20204.  Bovine serum penicillin 
levels in response to both products during both periods of the trial 
were statistically analyzed.  No statistically significant differences 
were noted between the two drugs.  Values for serum levels over time, 
Ka, Tmax, Cmax, Ke, T1/2, Tp and AUC were very similar between the two 
products.<p>
Therefore, it is concluded that Flocillin &#174  and Anthony's products, 
Combicillin &#174  and Combicillin-AG &#174  , are bioequivalent and will be 
similarly effective when used in cattle, horses, and dogs.<p>

<B>5.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</B><p>

The pioneer product, Bristol Laboratories' Flo-Cillin &#174  NADA 65-169, was 
approved as safe and effective for use as labeled on February 16, 1979 
(<B>44 Fed.  Reg.  10059</B>).  The demonstration of bioequivalence to that 
product established that no additional target animal safety studies were 
required for Combicillin &#174  and Combicillin-AG &#174.<p>

<B>6.  HUMAN SAFETY</B><p>

The bioequivalence study in cattle, described previously, demonstrates 
that the two Anthony Products, Combicillin &#174  and Combicillin-AG &#174  , are 
bioequivalent to the Bristol pioneer product.  Residue depletion data 
gathered using equivalent, approved products have demonstrated that a 
preslaughter withdrawal period of 30 days in beef cattle is adequate to 
ensure that penicillin residues do not exceed 0.05 ppm in edible tissues 
of treated animals.  Combicillin &#174  and Combicillin-AG &#174  will be assigned 
the same preslaughter withdrawal period on both labels.<p>

This drug should not be used in horses intended for food.
Use of this drug in beef cattle should be withheld for 30 days before 
slaughter for human consumption.<p>

<B>7.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><p>

The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of 
section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Anthony Products, 
Combicillin &#174  or Combicillin-AG &#174  , when used under their labeled 
conditions of use are safe and effective in cattle, horses, and dogs.<p>

The sponsor submitted bioequivalency data which demonstrated biological 
equivalence to the approved pioneer product.  This bioequivalency blood 
level study was accepted in lieu of tissue depletion.  Therefore, for 
human food safety considerations, when bioequivalence is demonstrated 
through blood level studies, the DESI "Me-Too" product is assigned the 
same withdrawal period as the reference product (30 days).  The 
tolerance for penicillin is established at 0.05 parts per million 
(negligible residue) in the uncooked edible tissues of cattle (See <B>21 
CFR 556.510</B>).<p>
The pioneer injectable penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine 
product which is currently on the market for use in beef cattle only, is 
an over-the-counter drug.  Adequate directions for use have been written 
for the layman, and the conditions for use are likely to be followed in 
practice.<p>
Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that 
Combicillin-AG &#174  will also have over-the-counter marketing status.  
However, Combicillin &#174  which is indicated for use in horses, dogs, and 
beef cattle, is limited to prescription status because it carries 
nonfood species indications (dogs and horses) and must be administered 
under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian.<p>

Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, 
this approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under section 
512 (c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) 
(21 U.S.C.  360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this approval does not qualify for 
marketing exclusivity because no new clinical or field investigations 
other than bioequivalence or residue studies and no new human food 
safety studies other than bioequivalence or residue studies were 
essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>d.  The trade name of the drug:</b>   
Fura-Zone Solution, Brand of Nitrofurazone Soluble Dressing<P>   
<b>e.  Marketing Status:</b> 
Over the counter (OTC)<P>
<b>f. Date of Approval:</b> February 18, 1987<P>
<b>II. INDICATION FOR USE:</b><P>
    For use only on dogs, cats, and horses (not intended for food use). For
the prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds,
burns, cutaneous ulcers and abscesses after incision.<P>
<b>III. DOSAGE FORM:</b><P>
a.  Nitrofurazone is available in the form of a water soluble solution.<P>
b.  Route of Administration - The route of administration is topical.<P>
c.   Recommended Dosage: Apply directly on the lesion.  For wet dressings, it
may be diluted with two or three parts of sterile water or saline solution.
This may be applied several times daily or left beneath the occlusive dressing
for several days.<P>
<b>IV. ANIMAL EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY:</b><P>
Nitrofurazone Solution (Furacin Solution, NADA 006-475) was the subject of a
review by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC),
Drug Efficacy Study Group, the results of which were published in the Federal
Register of January 19, 1979 (44 FR 4014).  NAS/NRC concluded, and FDA
concurred that the product was "effective" for the prevention or treatment of
surface bacterial infections of wounds, burns and cutaneous ulcers.  Due to
concern for the safety of residues from food-producing animals, FDA concluded
that the use of this and other NAS/NRC reviewed nitrofurazone topical products
must be limited to dogs, cats, and horses (not intended for food use).  The
Federal Register publication dated January 19, 1979, on Nitrofurazone Topical
Preparations for use in non-food animals, states the applications providing for
the effective conditions of use identified in that notice need not include data
required by 514.111 to establish the effectiveness of the drug for these
uses.<P>
Under Center for Veterinary Medicine policy, the principles of 21
CFR 320.22 providing for a waiver of the requirement for submission of evidence
of <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioavailability and bioequivalence are applied to NAS/NRC
reviewed topicals which have been found to be effective.  Therefore, such data
were neither required nor submitted.<P>
<b>V. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved for use only on
dogs, cats, and horses (not intended for food use) and is labeled:  "Not for
use on horses intended for food."<P>
Human safety relative to possession, handling, and administration:<P>
Labeling contains adequate caution statement.<P>
<b>VI. AGENCY CONCLUSION:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the conclusions of
NAS/NRC review as concurred in by FDA and with CVM'S policy concerning
bioequivalence of topical drugs and demonstrate that Fura-Zone (nitrofurazone)
Solution 0.2%, when used under its approved conditions of use is safe and
effective for the prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of
wounds, burns and cutaneous ulcers on dogs, cats, and horses not intended for
food.<P>
The drug is labeled for over-the-counter (OTC) use for the following
reasons:<P>
a.   It is a generic topical antibacterial preparation with a long OTC
marketing history of safe and effective use for the above indications.<P>
b.  A diagnosis by a veterinarian is not necessary, as the labeled use
conditions are easily recognized by laymen.<P>
In view of the above, it is approved for over-the-counter marketing because
adequate directions for use by laymen can be written.<P>

<b>IV. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data:</b><P>
The safety and effectiveness data upon which this application
was approved are found in NADA 043-290 for Pfizer, Inc., and
are summarized in an FOI Summary in Docket Number 75N0217.<P>
<b>V. Agency Conclusion:</b><P>
Approval of this application relies on safety and effectiveness data
contained in Pfizer's approved NADA 043-290. Use of the data in NADA
043-290 to support this application has been authorized by Pfizer. This
approval does not change the approved use of the drug. Consequently,
approval of this NADA poses no increased human risk from exposure to
residues of the animal drug, nor does it change the conditions of
the drug's safe use in the target animal species. Accordingly, under the
Center for Veterinary Medicine's supplemental approval policy (42 FR
64367), the approval of this NADA has been treated as would approval of
a Category II change and did not require reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness data in NADA 043-290.<P>

Lincomycin is a continuous use production drug (fed longer than 14 days) and 
fenbendazole is a short term therapeutic treatment. The study required for this
type of 
approval is one that demonstrates the effectiveness of fenbendazole when fed
in 
combination with lincomycin (see Center for Veterinary Medicine <i>Staff Manual
Guide </i>, IV. 
Supplemental Policies, Guide 1240.4145, dated 4/16/90). <p>
A controlled critical experiment was conducted using 80 pigs which were
experimentally 
infected. The experiment demonstrated significant differences in parasite
removal and is 
summarized below. <p>
Eighty pigs were experimentally infected with <i>Ascaris suum</i>&#160; and 
<i>Trichuris suis </i>.
The pigs 
were randomly assigned to 8 treatment groups of 10 each; each treatment
group 
contained 2 replicates of 5 each. The analysis of the data shows a significant
reduction (p 
&lt;.05) in the number of parasites present in animals receiving fenbendazole.
The treatment 
groups and data are summarized in Table 1. <p>

The New Animal Drug Application upon which approval of fenbendazole in
combination    
with lincomycin is based contains an adequate and well-controlled study
demonstrating the    
safety of the combination when administered in the feed to pigs. <p>
This study was designed to evaluate the target animal safety aspects of animals
treated    
with various dosages of fenbendazole and lincomycin. Forty pigs weighing
approximately    
35 lbs were divided into 4 groups of 10 pigs each. Treatment regimens reflected
0, IX, 3X    
or 5X the suggested maximum dosage treatments (fenbendazole = 3 mg/kg for 3
days, 9    
mg/kg for 9 days, or 15 mg/kg for 9 days, lincomycin = 200 g/t, 600 g/t or 1000
g/t for 21    
days). <p>
This study was conducted by T. S. van Veen, Veterinary Clinical Center,
Michigan State    
University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824. <p>
Parameters measured included body weight (weekly), clinical observations
(daily), clinical    
chemistry and hematology (onset, middle, and termination of study). The latter
two    
parameters included complete blood count, activated partial thromboplastin
time, serum    
chemistry profile, and serum electrolyte profile. None of the parameters
measured at any    
dosage were outside of physiological ranges. <p>
This study demonstrates normal physiological function (used as a measure of
safety) when    
fenbendazole and lincomycin are administered concomitantly in feed to pigs. <p>
<b>6. Human Safety: </b><p>
<b>A. Toxicity Tests:</b> <p>
The original NADA's and FOI summaries for each drug demonstrate that food
from 
animals fed these products is safe for human consumption. <p>

<b>B. Safe Concentration of Residues:</b> <p>
In swine a tolerance of 0.1 ppm lincomycin is established for negligible
residues in the    
edible tissues (21 CFR 556.360). A tolerance for marker residues of
fenbendazole in swine    
is not needed. The safe concentration for total residues of fenbendazole in
uncooked    
edible tissues of swine are 5 ppm in muscle, 15 ppm in liver, 20 ppm in kidney,
and 20    
ppm in skin and fat (21 CFR 556.275). <p>
<b>C. Residue Depletion Non-interference Study: </b><p>
The residue data supporting the approved individual uses of fenbendazole and
lincomycin    
have been submitted in their respective original applications. The summaries of
the study    
conducted for this combination are presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4. These
summaries    
establish that each drug in the presence of the tolerance(s) and that none of
the drugs    
interferes with the other's tissue residue assay. The pigs in this study were
fed lincomycin    
(100 g/t or 200 g/t) for 12 days prior to the withdrawal period in combination
with    
fenbendazole (total dose of 9 mg/kg divided over 3 or 12 days) for 3 or 12 days
prior to    
the withdrawal period. Liver and kidney were collected and assayed for
lincomycin    
residues. Liver was also assayed for fenbendazole residues (fenbendazole assay
detection    
limit 0.02 ppm, lincomycin assay detection limit 0.067 ppm). The tissues were
collected on    
the withdrawal days indicated in Tables 2, 3 and 4. <p>

Along with the residue depletion results presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4, the
sponsor        
conducted a noninterference study for the fenbendazole tissue residue study by
spiking        
samples with fenbendazole and lincomycin and conducting fenbendazole assays.
The        
results demonstrated no interference by lincomycin on the assay for
fenbendazole. <p>
The sponsor conducted a noninterference study for lincomycin by spiking control
tissue        
samples with lincomycin and fenbendazole and then assaying these tissues for
lincomycin        
content. The results demonstrated no interference by fenbendazole on the tissue
assay for        
lincomycin. <p>
<b>E. Withdrawal Time: </b><p>
The data support a zero withdrawal for fenbendazole in swine tissues. Feeds
medicated        
with 100 or 200 g/t lincomycin must be withdrawn 6 days before swine are
slaughtered. <p>
<b>F. Category Type:</b> <p>
Under 21 CFR 558.3 (b)(1)(ii), fenbendazole is classified as a Category II drug
because a        
withdrawal period is required for the lowest use level in cattle feed. A
withdrawal period is        
also required for the use of lincomycin at 100-200 g/ton levels in swine.
Therefore,        
Medicated Feed Applications (FD 1900's) will be required for the combination
of        
fenbendazole and lincomycin in swine feeds. <p>
Under Section 21 CFR 558.4 (e) when drugs from both categories are used in        
combination, [Lincomycin (Category I) &amp; Fenbendazole (Category II)] the
Category II        
requirements will apply to the combination. <p>
<b>G. Regulatory Methods:</b> <p>
A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for lincomycin
residues. The        
method titled "Determination of Lincomycin Residues in Broiler Chicken Tissues"
is on file        
at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration (HFV-199)
7500        
Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855. <p>
An HPLC assay method is used to assay tissues for fenbendazole. This method
titled        
"Determinative Procedure for the Measurement of Fenbendazole in Bovine Liver
Tissue" is        
on file at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration
(HFV-199)        
7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855. <p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b> <p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA, satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the        
Act and demonstrate that the combination of fenbendazole and lincomycin, when
fed to        
growing swine under its labeled conditions of use, is safe and effective. <p>
Because this drug contains a combination of two previously approved active
ingredients,        
this original new animal drug application is treated as a Category II drug [21
CRF 514.106        
(b) (2)]. A reevaluation of underlying safety and effectiveness data in the two
parent        
applications was not required. <p>
The sponsor demonstrated via residue depletion studies using approved
regulatory        
methods, that the depletion characteristics of the marker residue for each drug
in the        
combination were not significantly modified. Based on the lack of significant
change in        
depletion characteristics, CVM concluded that the composition of the residue
for each drug        
is not changed. The sponsor also demonstrated that the existing regulatory
method for        
each drug is not interfered with by residues of the other drug. Based on the
foregoing, it        
was not necessary to reevaluate the underlying toxicity tests supporting the
separate        
approvals, or to require additional metabolism and total residue depletion
studies. <p>
Adequate directions for use of this combination product by nonveterinarians
have been        
clearly written, and there is reasonable certainty that the conditions of use,
including mixing        
directions, as stated on the label can and will be followed by the feed mill
and producer.        
Approved over-the-counter products containing fenbendazole and lincomycin alone
are        
marketed for the same claims as are on the label for the combination product.
The Agency        
is not aware of any reason why the combining of the two products would require
restriction        
of the new product to prescription use. <p>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Act, this approval qualifies for a
three-year period of        
exclusivity to NADA's for the previously approved active ingredients because
new clinical        
trials, field investigations, and human food safety data were required for
approval.&#26;   <p>

<b>4.   Effectiveness:</b><p>
<b>Pivotal Studies:</b><p>
 Four adequate and well-controlled clinical dose titration studies were
conducted at three United States locations and one Canadian site.   The names
and locations of the investigators are presented below:<p>
Dr. Mary Wray <br>  Horton Feedlot/Research Center<br>  Wellington, CO<p>
Mr. Ray Grimson <br>Lakeside Research<br>   Brooks, Alberta, CANADA<p>
Dr. Donald Gill<br> Oklahoma State University<br>   Stillwater, OK<p>
Dr. Rodney Preston<br>  Texas Tech University<br>   Lubbock, TX<p>
The purpose of the studies was to determine the effective dose levels of
virginiamycin on rate of weight gain, feed efficiency and liver abscess
incidence in feedlot cattle.<p>
A total of 1520 cattle (1120 steers and 400 heifers) were used in the studies.
At each of the four study locations, four treatment groups were replicated ten
times in a randomized complete block design. Commercially available breeds were
used, and animals were randomly assigned to pens based on their sex (only at
Colorado and Alberta where both steers and heifers were used) and initial body
weight (600-lbs).  Treatments were randomly assigned to pens within each weight class.  The
pen was the experimental unit, there were 10 cattle per pen at two sites and 8
cattle per pen at the other two sites.<p>
The treatment groups were 0, 10, 17.5 or 25 g/ton virginiamycin in complete
feed (100&#37; dry matter basis).   The unmedicated group served as the control.
Virginiamycin was supplied as Stafac(R) 500, the marketed formulation, and was
administered orally via the feed as described on the label.<p>
Management practices employed were consistent with commercial feedlot
operations except that animals were fed once daily on an <i>ad  libitum</i>&#160;
 basis.   The diets were routinely assayed to assure that proper medication
levels were maintained.   The studies lasted 113-142 days; blocks of animals
were removed at the study end when the investigator determined that desirable
finish had been achieved.<p>
 Feed consumption, body weight and liver abscess scores were the primary
parameters evaluated.  Daily feed offered and periodic feed weighbacks by pen
were recorded.   Individual body weights were recorded approximately every 28
days.   At study end, individual livers were scored 0,  1, 2 or 3, with 3
corresponding to the most severe abscess(es).   Additionally, the test animals
were observed throughout the studies for general health and for potential
adverse drug effects, and at slaughter a variety of carcass parameters were
recorded.<p>
Average daily gain was calculated for each pen as the total body weight gain
divided by the number of animals and the length of the interval (lbs/head/day).
 Feed efficiency was calculated for each pen as the total feed consumed
(adjusted for removals and expressed on a dry matter basis) divided by the
total weight gain.   Liver abscess scores were condensed into either not
condemned (score &#61; 0) or condemned (score &#61; 1, 2 or 3); the proportion was then
subjected to the arcsin transformation for statistical analysis.<p>
The results for the four individual trials and the pooled analysis are
summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3 for the Average Daily Gain, Feed Efficiency and
Liver Abscess Incidence, respectively.<p>

Average
daily gain and feed efficiency for each individual trial was analyzed using
analysis of variance (ANOVA)  for a randomized complete block design.  Then the
Colorado and Alberta studies were combined and analyzed similarly, there was no
significant difference in the response curves for steers and heifers
(p&gt;0.25) in this unweighted ANOVA (i.e., sex by treatment interaction was
non-significant).  Next, all four studies were combined.   Bartlett's test
revealed no significant heterogeneity of variance, so an unweighted ANOVA was
performed.  The overall treatment effects for both average daily gain and feed
efficiency were significant (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively).   The
pooled data were fitted using polynomial regression and linear plateau models.
For average daily gain, linear plateau model II (1,3) best described the data,
and along with the method of nonoverlapping confidence intervals, determined
that 17.5 to 25 g/ton was the effective dose range.   For feed efficiency,
linear plateau model III-2 (0,3) best described the data and determined that 12
to 17.5 g/ton was the effective dose range.<p>
Liver abscess incidence, calculated as the arcsin of the square root of the
proportion condemned, was analyzed as described above.   There was no
significant difference in response for steers and heifers (p&gt;0.25).   In the
unweighted ANOVA, the overall treatment effect was significant (p&lt;0.01).
Linear plateau model III-l (1,3) best described the data,  15 to 17.5 g/ton is
the effective dose range.<p>
No adverse reactions attributable to virginiamycin were observed.<p>
 
 
<b>5.   Animal Safety:</b><p>
<b>Target Animal Safety of Virginiamycin in Beef Cattle</b><p>
<b>Study Number: </b>   VM-1042-87<p>
<b>Investigator:</b><p>    Dr. Jeffrey Davidson<br>    Health Management Services<br>

The study objective was to determine the potential toxicity of virginiamycin
when fed to beef cattle for 112 consecutive days at 25, 
and 125 g/ton.   Additionally, drug tolerance was tested by administering 625
g/ton for 28 days.   This study was conducted in accordance with FDA GLP and
CVM's Target Animal Safety Guidelines.<p>
Thirty-six (18 males and 18 females) English bred cattle, 6-12 months of age
and with an average initial body weight of 206 kg, were studied.   The animals
were randomly assigned by weight and sex to the following treatment groups: 0,
25, 75,  125, 625 g/ton.   Two males and two females were assigned to the 625
g/ton group, and four males and four females were assigned to each of the other
treatments. Virginiamycin was administered in the feed using the marketed
formulation.<p>
The cattle were inspected twice a day by the investigator for evidence of any
clinical/toxicological abnormalities.  A thorough physical exam, clinical
pathology, urinalysis, blood and serum chemistries and fecal sample examination
was performed on all of the animals during the acclimation period (5 days prior
to the initiation of the study) and on days 0, 28, 56, 84 and 111 of the study.
Daily feed consumption was recorded and body weights were measured
approximately every 28 days.  The animals were necropsied by a board certified
pathologist by block on days 112, 113 and 114.  Group five animals were
necropsied on day 30.<p>
Growth performance data were analyzed for each 28 day interval and cumulatively
over the course of the 112 day trial.   Overall data are presented in Table 4.
Virginiamycin treatment groups (25, 75 and 125 g/ton) were compared to cattle
receiving a non-medicated ration. Results indicate that cattle fed either 25 or
75 g/ton virginiamycin had average daily gains,  feed intakes,  and feed
efficiency values which were similar to or better than control animals for each
period and cumulatively over the 112 day trial. Cattle fed 125 g/ton
virginiamycin showed reduced feed intake during all periods  (p&lt;0.10) and
cumulatively over the course of the trial (p&lt;0.05).  Growth performance data
for cattle in the 625 g/ton group during days 0-28 indicated that the medicated
cattle had poorer average daily gain and feed intake (p&lt;0.05) than
control.<p>

No significant abnormalities were noted in the general health, behavior or
equilibrium of the animals, or in the various body systems which were examined
by the investigator.   No animals became ill, except for some transient
diarrhea which occurred both in the control and the virginiamycin treatment
groups.  There was no mortality in the study.   Statistical analyses were
conducted for each of the clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical
chemistry, and urinalysis) using a repeated measures analysis with covariance
adjustments for baseline (Day 0) values.   Although significant differences
were detected for some parameters, all mean results were within the range of
expected variation and differences were biologically and toxicologically
insignificant  There were no lesions identified that were related to treatment
with virginiamycin.<p>
No major adverse effects were observed in male or female cattle consuming 1X,
3X, 5X and 25X the recommended dosage level of 25 g/ton virginiamycin.   The
results of this study demonstrate the high level of safety for cattle fed at
higher than the recommended dosages of virginiamycin.<p>

The objective of this non-pivotal study was to evaluate the safety of
virginiamycin when fed to beef cattle for 23 weeks at 100 and 500 ppm. This
study provides supportive data that virginiamycin is safe in feedlot steers.<p>
Eighteen (9 males and 9 females) Hereford cattle, with an average initial body
weight of 291 kg, were studied.  The animals were randomly assigned by weight
and sex to the following treatment groups: 0,  100, and 500 ppm.
Virginiamycin was administered in the feed using the marketed formulation.<p>
The animals were observed daily for evidence of any clinical/toxicological
abnormalities.  Physical examinations were performed on a weekly basis by the
study director.   The individual body weights were measured  at  four week
intervals, except for the final weights which were taken after 23 weeks.   Feed
consumption was recorded for each period.<p>
Growth performance data were analyzed for six time intervals:  0-4 
weeks, 0-8 weeks, 0-12 weeks, 0-16 weeks, 0-20 weeks and 0-23 weeks.
Virginiamycin treatment groups (100 and 500 ppm) were compared to cattle
receiving a non-medicated ration.  Results indicate that cattle fed either 100
or 500 ppm virginiamycin had average daily gains, feed intakes and feed
efficiency values which were similar to control animals over the 23 week
trial.<p>
No significant abnormalities were noted in the general health, behavior or
equilibrium of the animals, or in the various body systems which were examined
by the investigator.  No animals became ill except for some transient diarrhea
which occurred in both  the  control and  the  virginiamycin
treatment groups.  There was no mortality in the study. Upon necropsy, there
were no grossly visible lesions identified that were related to treatment with
virginiamycin.   Because of the normal clinical performance and appearance of
the cattle and the absence of any remarkable gross pathology, histopathology
was not conducted on the tissues.<p>
No adverse effects were observed in male or female cattle consuming 4x
and 20x the recommended dosage laevel of 25 g/ton virginiamycin.  The
results of this study support the high level of safety for cattlefed at higher
than recommended dosages of virginiamycin.<p>

Nine Hereford cattle (five steers and four heifers) weighing 230 - 300 kg were
administered 14C-virginiamycin medicated feed at 0.34 mg/kg body weight/day for
21, 28 or 35 days.   This dosage is 
equivalent to 0.17 mg/kg body weight/day (weight basis) and 12.1 g/ton in
complete feed.   Following sacrifice at a practical zero withdrawal (10-12
hours after removal of medicated feed), liver, kidney, muscle, subcutaneous

Because a steady-state residue level was not reached, least squares
linear regression was applied to the liver data to predict the maximum
potential residue in liver after 150 days of medication followed by zero
withdrawal.   This is a conservative ('worst case') estimate because it assumes
no equilibration will occur.  Equilibration has been established in chickens
and turkeys at 20 and 35 days, respectively.   Since metabolism profiles are
similar among chickens, turkeys, rats and cattle, it is likely that tissue
equilibration in cattle will also occur.<p>
In fact, the cattle data  at  21, 28 and 35 days indicate the beginning of
the equilibration plateau  at 35  days.   Therefore, the predicted value
of 619 ppb virginiamycin residues in cattle liver after 150 days of medication
is a worst case estimate.<p>
The residue data from this study were further adjusted to account for dosing at
12.1 g/ton.  The maximum recommended dose in cattle is 25 g/ton.   Therefore,
the 619 ppb estimated total residue after 150 days of medication at 12.1 g/ton
is equivalent to 1279 ppb after 150 days of medication at 25 g/ton, assuming
that total virginiamycin residues increase in direct proportion to the
administered dose.   This assumption is supported by data obtained in the
following study.<p>

Twelve Friesan-Hereford cattle (eight males and four females) were administered
non-radiolabelled virginiamycin for 14 days  at  1 mg/kg body weight/day
followed by 14C-virginiamycin for 7 days at the same dose level.   All doses
were administered in gelatin capsules.  Three cattle were sacrificed at each of
the following withdrawal times:  10, 24, 72, and 120 hours after the last dose.

These
data demonstrate that after seven days of dosing at 1 mg/kg body weight/day,
cattle subjected to a practical zero withdrawal (10 hours after the last dose)
have 228-424 ppb total virginiamycin residues in liver.   In the previously
described study,  V-M-4044-87, least squares linear regression of  the
 total liver residue data yields a predicted total liver residue value of
45.0 ppb for seven days of dosing at 0.17 mg/kg body weight/day at zero
withdrawal.  The difference in dose levels is approximately six-fold.
Assuming a direct linear relationship between dose and tissue residue levels,
the expected liver residue from study  V-M-4044-87 a t a six-fold
increased dose would be 45.0 x 6 &#61; 270 ppb, which is within the range of
observed values in study V-4027-84.   The conservative estimate of 1279 ppb
total virginiamycin residues in cattle liver at zero withdrawal is supported by
these two studies.<p>
Comparative metabolism studies are summarized below.<p>

<b>Examination of Cattle Liver for the Presence of Virginiamycin
Metabolites</b><p>
<b>Study Number: </b>                V-4045-87<p>
<b>Investigator:</b> <p>   Dr. David Gottschall<br>    SmithKline Beecham Animal
Health<br>  1600 Paoli Pike<br> West Chester, PA  19380<p>
Liver tissue was obtained from cattle treated with 14C-virginiamycin for 35 days
in study V-M-4044-87.  Livers were extracted with organic solvents and
aqueous buffer, and the extracts were characterized by HPLC and scintillation
counting.<p>
 
Approximately 30&#37; of the total liver radioactivity was extractable with
methanol (21.4&#37;) and phosphate buffer (8.4&#37;). The methanol extract was further
separated into chloroform (11.8&#37;) and methanol/water (8.4&#37;) solubles.   Most of
the radioactivity remained as an intractable residue.   The extractable
radioactivity was further fractionated by HPLC analysis followed by
scintillation counting of the collected fractions.   The data indicated that no
fraction contained greater than 4.9&#37; (7 ppb) of the total residue.
Additionally, virginiamycin fortified tissue extraction and analysis indicated
that nearly 90&#37; of the 14C-virginiamycin was recoverable if present in the
liver as the intact molecule.   Virginiamycin is extensively metabolized in
cattle and no single residue is present in sufficient quantity (i.e. &gt;10&#37; or
100 ppb) to be considered a major metabolite.<p>
<b>Examination of Virginiamycin Metabolites in Cattle Liver</b><p>
<b>Study Number: </b>               V-4031-85<p>

Liver tissue was obtained from cattle treated with nonradiolabelled
virginiamycin for 14 days followed by 7 days of 14C-virginiamycin in study
V-4027-84.  Livers were extracted with organic solvents and aqueous buffer, and
the extracts were characterized by HPLC and scintillation counting.<p>
Approximately 37&#37; of the total liver radioactivity was extractable with
methanol (29.9&#37;) and phosphate buffer (7.0&#37;). The methanol extract was further
separated into chloroform (12.0&#37;) and methanol/water (22.3&#37;) solubles.   The
majority of the radioactivity remained as intractable residue.   The
extractable radioactivity was further fractionated by HPLC analysis followed by
scintillation counting of the collected fractions.   The data indicated that no
fraction contained greater than 6.4&#37; (31 ppb) of the total residue.   The
results confirm the previous finding from study V-4045-87 that virginiamycin is
extensively metabolized in cattle and no single residue is present in
sufficient quantity to be considered a major metabolite.<p>
  Table 7 shows that partitioning of virginiamycin metabolites is similar
in all species examined.<p>

Since none of the cattle metabolites would be expected to produce toxicity
different than that demonstrated with virginiamycin, no further identification,
characterization or toxicity testing of these minor metabolic products was
required.<p>
<b>D.   Withdrawal Period and Regulatory Method</b><p>
Total residues of virginiamycin and its metabolites  at  zero withdrawal
following 150 days of administration at 25 g/ton are conservatively estimated
to be 1.279 ppm, well below the established safe concentration of 60 ppm, thus
satisfying the residue chemistry requirements for zero withdrawal.<p>
The residue level is so low compared to the calculated permitted residue level
that a regulatory method to monitor residues is not required.<p>
<b>E.   Antimicrobial Drugs for Long-term, Subtherapeutic Use in Animal
Feeds</b><p>
 In accordance with 21 CFR 558.15, two studies were conducted to evaluate
the effect of long-term, subtherapeutic use of virginiamycin in feedlot cattle
on the development of antimicrobial resistance and on the <i>Salmonella
</i>&#160;reservoir.<p>
   
<b>Effect of Virginiamycin on Tissue Levels, Antimicrobial
Resistance and Shedding of <i>Salmonella typhimurium </i>&#160; from Cattle</b><p>
<b>Study Number:  </b>              VM-6004-86<p>
<b>Investigator:</b>  <p>  Dr. Diane Fagerberg<br> Colorado Animal Research
Enterprises<br> Fort Collins, CO<p>
Twenty-two calves were used in this study.   After four weeks of acclimation,
eighteen calves were fasted from food and water for 24 hours and then gavaged
with <i>S. typhimurium </i>&#160; culture.   Five days after the challenge, nine
calves were fed virginiamycin in the feed at 250 mg/head/day and nine calves
received non-medicated feed for eight weeks.   The four non-challenged calves
served as environmental controls, and the nine non-medicated calves served as
the dose control.   Fecal samples were collected prior to challenge, twice
during the five-day postchallenge/pretreatment period, and 16 times during the
next eight weeks.   At study end, liver, spleen andintestinal lymph node
samples were surgically excised from all challenged calves and the samples were
tested for the presence of test salmonellae.   <i>Salmonella </i>&#160; isolates were
tested for susceptibility to a spectrum of antibiotics.<p>
Virginiamycin   fed to Salmonella-colonized beef calves did not 
significantly   impact the overall mean Salmonella shedding, 
antimicrobial   resistance or tissue sequestering.<p>
<b>Effect of Virginiamycin on the Incidence of Antimicrobial Resistance of

Sixteen calves were used in this study.   Eight calves were fed virginiamycin
in the feed at 250 mg/head/day and eight calves received non-medicated feed for
eight weeks.   Fecal samples were obtained four times prior to treatment to
establish baseline data, and eight times during the eight weeks of treatment.
Coliform isolates were tested for susceptibility to a spectrum of
antibiotics.<p>
Continuous feeding of 250 mg/head/day virginiamycin for eight weeks to
ruminating beef calves did not impact indigenous fecal coliform antimicrobial
resistance.<p>
  
<b>7.   Aqency Conclusions: </b>  <p>
This original NADA satisfies the requirements of section 512(b) of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and 
demonstrates that virginiamycin (V-Max&#174;) when used under proposed conditions
of use is safe and effective for the labeled indications. This production
enhancing drug has been classified as "OTC."   Its use does not raise any
special safety concerns or require any diagnosis. Adequate directions for lay
use have been included in the labeling. 
A tolerance for residues of  virginiamycin  in cattle tissue is not
required.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval   for food producing animals qualifies for three  years of
marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the application
contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

  The purpose of the studies was to determine the dose response for
trenbolone acetate (TBA) and estradiol (E2Beta) ear implants on rate of weight
gain and feed efficiency of confined steers. The test animals were cross-bred
animals of European breeds. There were 7 to 10 animals per pen depending on
study location. Each treatment was replicated 8 times (8 pens/treatment) in all
three studies. The steers weighed between 700 (318 kg) to 750 (341 kg) lbs.
when the studies were initiated. Eight hundred sixty-four steers were treated
in these three dose titration studies.   <p> 
  REVALOR&#174;-S was given via ear implants. The implants were placed
subcutaneously on the back side of the mid-ear. Each dose was made up of the
appropriate number of pellets, with each pellet containing 20 mg trenbolone
acetate and 4 mg estradiol. The control cattle were not implanted. The dosages
given in each study were (TBA/E2Beta): 0/0, 140/0, 0/30, 20/4, 80/16, and 140/28.
The steers were implanted once at the initiation of the study. The termination
of the studies ranged between 144 and 160 days.   <p> 
  Average daily gain and feed efficiency data are summarized in Table 1 for
each of the three dose titration studies.   <p>

  A randomized complete block design was used for all studies and the data
were pooled by analysis of variance to determine the significance of the effect
of trenbolone acetate/estradiol implants on average daily gain and feed
efficiency. There was a significant (P &lt; .05) dose effect on both average
daily gain and feed efficiency with the maximum response for both parameters
plateauing at a dose of 120 mg trenbolone acetate and 24 mg estradiol. The 120
mg TBA/24 mg E2Beta was also shown to be significantly (P &lt; .05) better than
140 mg TBA alone and 30 mg E2Beta alone. These data indicate that TBA and E2Beta are
effective for the indications for use and dosage as given in Sections 2 and 3
above.   <p> 
  The effects of treatment on carcass parameters (yield grade, quality grade,
and marbling scores) and on the incidence of liver abscesses were evaluated at
slaughter. At the 140 mg TBA/28 mg E2Beta dose, a 10% decrease in marbling scores
was observed (P &lt; .05). Because of this observed decrease in marbling
scores, the following statement is required on the label: Studies have
demonstrated that the administration of Revalor&#174;-S can result in decreased
marbling scores when compared to non-implanted steers. No effect of treatment
was seen on yield grade or the incidence of liver abscesses.   <p> 
  <b>B. Clinical Field Studies: </b>  <p> 
  Three clinical field studies were conducted to confirm the significant
response observed in average daily gain and feed efficiency in the dose
titration studies. These studies were conducted using a uniform protocol so
that the results could be pooled and summarized. These studies were also
conducted in the major beef producing areas of the United States.   <p> 
  The test animals were cross-bred animals of European breeds. There were
seven (7) to eight (8) animals per pen depending upon study location. Each
treatment was replicated five times (5 pens/treatment) at each location. The
steers weighed between 675 (307 kg) and 750 (341 kg) lbs at the initiation of
these studies. A total of 230 animals was used for these field studies.   <p> 
  The steers were implanted (subcutaneously on the back side of the mid-ear)
once at the initiation of the studies with 140 mg TBA/28 mg E2Beta or served as
non-implanted controls.   <p> 
  A randomized complete block design was used for all studies and the data
were pooled by analysis of variance to determine the significance of the effect
of REVALOR&#174;-S on average daily gain and feed efficiency. There was a significant
(P &lt; .05) improvement in both average daily gain and feed efficiency for the
steers implanted with TBA/E2Beta when compared to the steers in the control groups

 <b> 5. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY: </b>  <p> 
  <b>Drug Safety Study: </b>  <p> 
  A target animal safety study was conducted by Dr. N. L. Roberts, Huntington
Research Center, Huntington, Cambridgeshire, England. The purpose of the study
was to assess the safety to beef cattle of trenbolone acetate and estradiol
given subcutaneously as an ear implant. Thirty-two (8 per group) yearling
cattle weighing approximately 407 lbs (185 kg) at the initiation of the study
were given the following dosages of trenbolone acetate/estradiol: control (no
implant), 140/28, 420/84 and 700/140 per animal. There were four steers and
four heifers in each of the four treatment groups. The cattle were implanted
once at the beginning of the study and the study was terminated after 160 days.
The parameters measured were clinical signs, body weights, clinical
biochemistry, and histopathology.   <p> 
  The treatment of beef cattle with REVALOR&#174;-S by subcutaneous implantation at
1.2, 3.5, and 5.8 times the use level did not result in any adverse effects on
clinical health. Steers in all test groups and heifers in the high dose group
showed treatment-related increases in overall weight gain compared with the
control animals. No adverse treatment related changes of any toxicological
significance were observed in hematological parameters. At termination of the
study, no significant macroscopic abnormalities were observed on post-mortem
examination, although prostate and seminal vesicle weights were significantly
greater in treated steers and uterine and ovarian weights were greater in
treated heifers, compared with controls. These changes were considered to be
due to the hormonal action of the test materials. On histopathological
examination of tissues from the control and high dose group, both prostate and
seminal vesicles showed moderate glandular development with secretion in
treated steers as compared with poor development in controls as a result of
castration. In females, mammary acinar development was moderate in treated
animals and minimal in controls. No other microscopic changes of significance
were observed. These changes were considered to be due to the hormonal action
of the test materials.   <p> 
  A drug tolerance study is not needed because there is no likelihood of
accidental overdosing with the use of ear implants.   <p> 
  <b>6. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY: </b>  <p> 
  <b>A. Toxicity Tests:</b>   <p> 
  The toxicity studies summarized in the FOI from NADA 138-612 (52 FR
24994-July 2, 1987) have met the Agency's requirements for human food safety
for trenbolone acetate. Acceptable safe incremental increases above naturally
occurring levels of estradiol have been established by the agency in 21 CFR
Section 556.240. The data in NADA 140-897 demonstrate that estradiol tissue
levels are well below the established permitted increases when used in
combination with trenbolone acetate.   <p> 
 <b> B. Safe Concentration of Residues:</b>   <p> 
  Data in the NADA for trenbolone acetate alone (NADA 138-612; 52 FR
24994-July 2, 1987) show that the safe concentration for total residues was 50
ppb for muscle, 100 ppb for liver, 150 ppb for kidney and 200 ppb for fat. The
total average trenbolone residues in the liver of cattle treated with 200 mg of
3H-trenbolone acetate were determined to be 43.8 ppb at 15 days after
implantation and 50.5 ppb after 30 days. The residues in muscle, kidney, and
fat were much lower. In the tissue residue study summarized in Section 6.C of
this FOI, the residues of trenbolone acetate in cattle implanted with REVALOR&#174;-S
are lower than the residues found in cattle implanted with 200 mg trenbolone
acetate only. Therefore, with the residues at 15 and 30 days post-implantation
being of adequate safety margins and trenbolone acetate residues from cattle
treated with REVALOR&#174;-S being lower than the residues from cattle implanted with
an approved use of trenbolone acetate only, a 0-withdrawal period was
established. Additionally it is not expected that any animals will be
intentionally slaughtered within 15 days after implantation. Therefore,
identification of a marker residue was not required.   <p> 
  In the tissue residue study summarized in Section 6.C. of this FOI, the
residues of estradiol are well below the safe incremental levels established in
21 CFR Section 556.240. Therefore an adequate safety margin for estradiol
residues has been established and no withdrawal period is required.   <p> 
  <b>C. Residue Depletion Study: </b>  <p> 
  A tissue residue study was conducted to determine the residues of estradiol
and the two metabolites of trenbolone acetate (17alpha-hydroxytrenbolone and
17Beta-hydroxytrenbolone). This study was conducted by Dr. Don Henricks, at
Clemson University, Clemson, S.C. Eight (8) steers were treated with 140 mg
trenbolone acetate and 28 mg estradiol. An additional eight (8) steers were
treated with 200 mg trenbolone acetate. There were also four (4) control steers
in the study. In each of the treatment groups, four steers were sacrificed 15
days after treatment and the other four steers were sacrificed 30 days after
the initial implantation. Muscle, fat, liver, and kidney samples were collected
from each animal on each of the sacrifice dates. After collection, the samples
were immediately frozen in dry ice and held frozen until they were assayed for
17alpha-hydroxytrenbolone, 17Beta-hydroxytrenbolone and estradiol residues. The
following two tables summarize the results from this study. As residue levels
were similar at the 15 and 30 day sampling, the results in the following two
tables are averaged across both sampling dates for the treated animals.
Estradiol residues were assayed in only the control steers and steers treated
with 140 mg TBA and 28 mg estradiol.   <p> 
  In Table 3, the results from the estradiol tissue assays are summarized.
The results of the estradiol assays from the treated and control animals are
compared with the acceptable safe incremental increases above naturally
occurring levels established in 21 CFR Section 556.240. The estradiol levels
from the treated and control animals were many times lower than the acceptable
safe incremental levels. Since the acceptable safe incremental increases of
estradiol exceed the estradiol levels found in the treated steers by such a
wide margin, it was concluded that no pre-slaughter withdrawal period and no
withholding restrictions were necessary. Thus there is no need for a regulatory
tissue assay method for estradiol.   <p>

</pre>

  The residues of 17alpha-hydroxytrenbolone and 17Beta-hydroxytrenbolone are
reported in Table 4. When the residues of the two trenbolone metabolites are
compared between the two implant groups, the residues from the implant
containing 140 mg TBA/28 mg E2Beta are consistently lower than the residues from
the steers implanted with only trenbolone acetate (200 mg). Thus, implanting
cattle with the combination product (REVALOR&#174;-S) gave trenbolone residues that
were lower compared to the residues when trenbolone is implanted alone.
Additional information on the residues of trenbolone acetate can be found in
the Freedom of Information Summary for NADA 138-612 (52 FR 24994-July 2,
1987).   <p>

 <b> D. Withdrawal Period </b>  <p> 
  As discussed above, no withdrawal period is required following the use of
trenbolone acetate and estradiol.   <p> 
  <b>E. Regulatory Method: </b>  <p> 
  As discussed above, no withdrawal time is required. Therefore it is not
necessary to have a regulatory assay method or a confirmatory assay method for
trenbolone acetate or estradiol tissue residues. The respective RIA procedures
for trenbolone acetate and estradiol were checked for cross-reactivity with the
anti-sera of the other and it was concluded that no interference
existed.   <p> 
  <b>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b>   <p> 
  The Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that the data submitted in
support of this New Animal Drug Application satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act. The data demonstrate that REVALOR&#174;-S (trenbolone acetate and
estradiol) is safe and effective to increase the rate of weight gain and
improve feed efficiency in feedlot steers, when used in accordance with its
labeled conditions of use. REVALOR&#174;-S was shown to provide improvement over each
compound used alone, in compliance with 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v).   <p> 
  The patent number and expiration date for the combination of TBA and
estradiol, as provided by the firm is: Patent no. 3,939,265 expires 2/17/93.
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this NADA qualifies for three years of marketing exclusivity because new
clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
were essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by
the applicant.   <p> 
  The Center has concluded that REVALOR&#174;-S is safe for over-the-counter (OTC)
use. Directions on the labeling and packaging are adequate and ear implantation
is a common method of administration of this type product within the feedlot
industry. Producers who use this product can be expected to safely and
successfully accomplish implantation. Further, there is no special need to
recognize a disease condition, the drug is not a "controlled substance," and
after implantation there is no need for medical monitoring or evaluation of the
treated animal. Accordingly, prescription restriction of this product is not
warranted.  <p>

<b>4 and 5.  EFFECTIVENESS and ANIMAL SAFETY</B><P>

Nitrofurazone Ointment (Furacin Dressing Veterinary, NADA  6-475) was  
  the subject of a review by the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, the results
of    
   which were published in the Federal Register of January  19, 1979  (44 FR
4014).   NAS/NRC concluded,  and FDA concurred that the product was "effective"
for the prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds,
burns, and cutaneous ulcers.  Due to concern for    
   the safety of residues from food-producing animals, FDA concluded that use
of this and other NAS/NRC reviewed nitrofurazone topical products must be
limited to dogs, cats, and horses (not intended for food use).  The Federal
Register publication dated January  19, 1979, on Nitrofurazone
Topical Preparations for use in non-food animals, states that applications
providing for the effective conditions of use identified in that notice need
not include data required by 21 CFR
514. 111 to establish the effectiveness of the drug for these uses. <p>
  Under Center for Veterinary Medicine policy, the principles of 21 CFR
320.22 providing for a waiver of the requirement for submission of    
  <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioavailability and bioequivalence are applied to
  NAS/NRC reviewed topicals which have been     
  found to be effective.
  Therefore, such data  were neither required nor submitted.    <p>  
 <b> 6.   HUMAN SAFETY  </b>  <p>
       
  Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved for use only
on dogs, cats, and horses (not intended for food use) and is labeled: Warning:
Do not use on horses intended for food.<p>  
 <b> Human safety relative to possession, handling, and administration: </b><p>
 Labeling
contains adequate caution statement.    <p>  
  <b> 7.       AGENCY   CONCLUSIONS </b>   <p>
     
  The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the conclusions of
NAS/NRC review as concurred in by FDA and with CVM's policy concerning
bioequivalence of topical drugs and demonstrate the Nitrofurazone Ointment
0.2%, when used under its approved conditions of use is safe and effective for
the prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds, burns,
and cutaneous ulcers of dogs, cats, and horses (not for food use).    <p>  
  The drug is labeled for over-the-counter (OTC) use for the following
reasons.   <ul> <p>  
  <li>a.   It is a generic topical antibacterial preparation with a long OTC
marketing history of safe and effective use for the above indications.    <p>  
  <li>b.    A diagnosis by a veterinarian is not necessary, as the labeled use
conditions are easily recognized by laymen.</ul>    <p>  
  In view of the above, it is approved for over-the-counter marketing because
adequate directions for use by laymen can be written.    <p>

<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a genetic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
genetic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with roxarsone and
bambermycins. Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this
generic combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is codified
under 21 CFR &#167;   558.550.  Bambermycins is codified under 21 CFR
&#167;  558.95. Roxarsone in this combination can be provided by A.L.
Laboratories, Inc. or Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., as codified under 21 CFR &#167;
 558.530. The combination of salinomycin sodium, bambermycins and
roxarsone is codified under 21 CFR &#167;  558.95(b)(1)(xi).<p>
<b>3.    HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this genetic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<p>
<b>a.    Tolerances for Residues</b><p>
The tolerance established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product applies to
the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for total
salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens were
established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat.
Bambermycins has a no-tolerance clearance as published in 40 FR 59726 (December
30, 1975). The safe concentration for total bambermycins residues in the
uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens were established in NADA 44-759 (38
FR 1274; January 11, 1973).<p>
Tolerances of arsenic (from roxarsone) are established at 0.5 ppm in muscle and
2 ppm in edible by-product (21 CFR &#167;  556.60) with liver as the
target tissue.<p>
<b>b.    Withdrawal Time</b><p>
Based on the information in 21 CFR &#167;  558.95(b)(1)(xi), a 5-day
withdrawal time is required for the combination of bambermycins, roxarsone and
salinomycin.<p>
<b>c.   Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels in
all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were significantly
below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>
A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for bambermycins
residues. The method entitled "Quantitative Agar Well Plate Assay of
Bambermycins (Flavomycin) in Organs and Tissues" is on file at the Center for
Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish P1.,
Rockville, MD 20855.<p>
A spectrophotometric method is used to assay tissues for roxarsone residues.
The method is entitled "Arsenic (Total) Residues in Animal Tissues,
Spectrophotometric Method" published in AOAC, 14th Edition 41.009, page 777.<p>
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS: </b><p> This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic   Act satisfies the requirements of
section 512(n) of the act and demonstrates that the    combination of
salinomycin sodium, bambermycins, and roxarsone when used under its 
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled
indications.<p>

The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of various dosages of
GnRH on the reproductive performance of cows with ovarian cysts.<p>
 
Test animals included 85 mature cows, predominantly of the Holstein breed, in
early lactation, with ovarian cysts, randomly assigned to one of four treatment
groups:<p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 2 columns.)</b><P>
<pre> 
<b>Group           Treatment</b> 

   1            Vehicle, control 
   2             50 &#181;g  Factrel&#174; 
   3            100 &#181;g  Factrel&#174; 
   4            250 &#181;g  Factrel&#174; 
 
Controls were given vehicle (without active drug) as a placebo. 
</pre>

Diagnosis of cystic ovaries was made by the attending veterinarian based on
rectal palpation.  Additionally, milk samples were taken at the time of
treatment and again at seven and 14 days following treatment for progesterone
determinations in an attempt to categorize the type of cyst.  Those cows with
milk progesterone &lt;1 ng/mL were presumed to have follicular cysts while
those with milk progesterone &gt;1 ng/mL were presumed to have luteal cysts or
partially luteinized follicular cysts.<p>
 
<b>Dosage form, dosage and route:</b><p> An injectable solution containing 50 &#181;g  GnRH per
mL, identical to the product to be marketed, was used and given as a single
intramuscular injection at a dose of 1, 2 or 5 mL per injection, corresponding
to the dosages in the above table.<p>
 
<b>Duration:</b><p> The reproductive performance of the cows was monitored through
subsequent estrus cycles and breeding(s) until pregnancy was confirmed or for a
minimum of 60 days post treatment.<p>
 
<b>Pertinent parameters measured included the following primary parameters:</b>    <p>
 
Days to first estrus following treatment<br>
Days to conception after treatment<br>
Pregnancy rate by 60 days post treatment (%)<br>
% of cows conceiving at first estrus after treatment<br>
% of cows conceiving on second and third estrus<p>
 
<b>Results of dose response clinical study:</b><p> pregnancy rate by 60 days post
treatment (80%) and the highest first post treatment estrus conception rate
(60%).  There were no apparent differences between treatment groups with regard
to average days to conception after treatment.<p>

Based on milk progesterone levels, 42% of the cows had some degree of
luteinization of the cyst at the time of treatment.  Cows with milk
progesterone &lt;1 ng/mL (follicular cysts) appeared to respond well to GnRH,
even at doses as low as 50 &#181;g  while cows with progesterone &gt;1 ng/mL
(luteinized cysts) appeared to respond better to the 250 &#181;g  dose.<p>
 
No adverse reactions of any kind were reported in this study.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions drawn from dose response clinical study:</b><p> Results of this study
suggest that (1) GnRH administration in cystic cows reduces time to first estrus,
(2) 100 &#181;g  is a justifiable dose and (3) cows with follicular cysts respond
better to lower doses than do cows with luteinized cysts.<p>

The purpose of the study was to determine whether or not overdosage of GnRH
would be toxic to cows.<p>
 
Test animals included eight normally cycling adult dairy cows; 4 Holsteins,
2 Ayrshires, a Jersey and a Guernsey; weighing between 980 and 1620 pounds,
divided into treatment group of 4 cows and a control group of 4 cows.<p>
Dosage form used was an injectable solution containing 50 &#181;g  GnRH per mL,
identical to the product to be marketed.  Controls were given diluent only, not
containing GnRH.<p>
 
<b>Dosage, route and duration:</b><p> Treatment cows were given 2,500 &#181;g  GnRH (50 mL
 Factrel&#174;) by deep intramuscular injection daily for 3 consecutive days while
controls received 50 mL diluent according to the same route and schedule.  This
dosage regimen corresponds to 25X the recommended dose of GnRH for 3X the
recommended duration.<p>
 
 Pertinent parameters measured included physical examination for general health
and signs of injection site irritation daily, hematology, serum chemistry and
urinalysis (except when no sample could be collected) determinations twice
before treatment and 1, 2, 4 and 8 days after treatment began;
determination of blood and milk progesterone activity before and after
treatment; and necropsy and gross pathologic examination of 2 cows of each
treatment group 5 days after the final injection.  <p>
 
Histopathology was performed on tissues from all organ systems and included
pituitary, ovary, and uterus as well as any other tissues with apparent gross
lesions.<p>
 
Additionally, LH assays were performed on blood samples drawn from each of the
four treatment cows and four control cows before and 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and
8 hours after the first and third intramuscular treatment.<p>
 
<b>Results of subacute toxicity study:</b><p> Physical examination daily revealed no
signs of adverse effects in either group and no signs of injection site
irritation.  All cows maintained body weight and except for one cow of the
control group, also maintained normal milk production throughout the study
period.<p>
 
Hematology and urinalysis results remained within normal limits throughout the
study period.  The only abnormalities noted on serum chemistry results were
elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity in 2 cows, 1 from each
treatment group.  This finding is attributable to muscle damage due to the
intramuscular injection of large amounts of material (50 mL, three injections)
and was no more prevalent in GnRH treated cows than in controls.<p>
 
After the first injection of GnRH (but not placebo), serum LH concentrations
increased as expected.  After the third injection, however, almost no LH surge
was detected, LH levels remaining close to basal levels.  These LH results are
summarized in more detail under "Human Food Safety".<p>
 
No drug related effects on serum and milk progesterone determinations were
detected as illustrated in the following charts:<p>

<b>CHARTS GO HERE ( page 9 hard copy)</b> <p> 
 
At necropsy, no gross pathologic signs of injection site irritation were noted.
No significant gross post mortem lesions were observed in the circulatory,
respiratory, digestive, urinary, non-reproductive endocrine or central nervous
systems.  No gross lesions of reproductive organs were observed; ovaries were
in various stages of follicular activity.<p>
  
Histopathologic examination of pituitaries (the target tissue of GnRH) of all
cows were within normal limits.  Histopathology on reproductive organs of GnRH
treated cows revealed changes expected following administration of GnRH in
cycling cows: intense mitotic activity in germinal epithelium of ovary,
congestion of endometrium and myometrium in the uterus.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions drawn from subacute toxicity study:</b><p> GnRH given at 25X overdosage
daily over a 3X time period was without toxic effects in dairy cows as
evidenced by physical examination, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis and
gross and histopathologic examination.<p>
 
<b>B. Effect of 5X and 10X GnRH Dosage on Reproductive Performance</b><p>
 
Investigator:<p>   This study is cited from the published literature (Dobson, H.,
Rankin, J.E.F. and Ward, W.R., Bovine Cystic Ovarian Disease: Plasma Hormone
Concentration and Treatment <i>Veterinary Record</i>,&#160; 101:459, 1977)<p>
 
The purpose of the study was to determine the hormonal status of cows with
cystic ovaries and to evaluate treatment, including GnRH.<p>
 
Test animals included 78 dairy cows with cystic ovaries of which ten with "low
progesterone cysts" (follicular cysts) and 20 with " high progesterone cysts"
(luteal cysts) were treated with GnRH.<p>
 
The diagnosis of cystic ovaries were based on rectal palpation and
determination of plasma progesterone and other reproductive hormone levels.<p>
 
Dosage, route and duration were a single intramuscular injection of either 500
or 1,000 &#181;g  GnRH, corresponding to 5X and 10X the recommended dose of
 Factrel&#174;.<p>
 
Pertinent parameters measured included determination of cyst removal by rectal
palpation seven days after treatment, number of cows showing estrus within 21
days, pregnancy rate, days to conception and average services per
conception.<p>
 
These parameters determined in GnRH treated cows were compared with those in
human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), progesterone and prostaglandin treated
cows.<p>
 
The results of the study are summarized in the table below.  In the group with
non luteinized follicular cysts, GnRH removed the cysts in 9 of 10 cows and
resulted in less time and fewer services to conception than the "foreign"
protein HCG with which it was compared.  In the group with luteal cysts, GnRH
treatment removed the cysts in 13 of 20 cows.  Pregnancy rates were similar
among treatments, indicating that GnRH given at these high dosages had no
detrimental effect on reproductive performance.<p>

The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of GnRH on the length of
the estrus cycle and any other adverse effects.<p>
 
Test animals were four health heifers known to have had at least two estrus
periods and had therefore completed at least one estrus cycle, divided into two
treatment groups of two heifers each.  Two heifers were treated on day 5,
early luteal phase, of the estrus cycle and two heifers were treated on day 14,
late luteal phase, of the estrus cycle.<p>
 
Dosage form, route, dosage and duration were 500 &#181;g  GnRH in 4 mL Bacteriostatic
Water for Injection, U.S.P., given as a single intramuscular dosage of 500 &#181;g ,
the effects of which were followed throughout the subsequent estrus cycle
(three to four weeks).  The 500 &#181;g  dosage represents 5X the recommended
clinical dose.<p>
 
Pertinent parameters measured included pulse and respiratory rates 15 and 60
minutes post injection, observations for any apparent behavioral changes,
palpation of the injection sites for any signs of local irritation, rectal
palpation 14 days after treatment, and daily observation for any clinical
abnormalities until estrus was observed.<p>
 
<b>Results of safety study in non-pregnant animals:</b> <p>GnRH treatment under the
conditions described had no clinical or behavioral effects in the heifers, nor
did GnRH have any apparent effect on the length of the estrus cycle or
condition of the uterus and ovaries, as summarized in the following table:<p>

<b>Conclusions drawn from safety study in nonpregnant heifers:</b><p> The findings in
this study were consistent with those in the published literature (Seguin,
Oxender, and Britt, <i>Am. J. Vet. Res.,</i>&#160; 38:1153, 1977) in which it was reported
that administration of 100 &#181;g  GnRH during the mid-luteal phase did not affect
corpus luteum function or the duration of the estrus cycle.<p>
 
It was therefore concluded that administration of GnRH to nonpregnant heifers
presents no hazard of toxicity.<p>

The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of GnRH on early
pregnancy, and any other adverse effects.<p>
 
Test animals were nine healthy, pregnant Holstein or Ayrshire cows divided into
three groups.  Extra cows were included in the 30 day treatment group since
pregnancy could not be confirmed by rectal palpation.  Treatment groups were
therefore as follows:<p>
 
30 day treatment: 5 cows (4 pregnant, 1 non pregnant)<br>
60 day treatment: 2 cows, pregnant<br>
90 day treatment: 2 cows, pregnant<p>
 
Dosage form, route, dosage and duration were 500 &#181;g  GnRH in 4 mL Bacteriostatic
Water for Injection, U.S.P., given as a single intramuscular dosage of 500 &#181;g ,
the effects of which were followed throughout the subsequent four to six weeks.
The 500 &#181;g  dosage represents 5X the recommended clinical dose.<p>
 
Pertinent Parameters Measured included observation for any clinical
abnormalities and confirmation of pregnancy by rectal palpation.<p>
 
<b>Results:</b><p> Of the four cows treated at 60 or 90 days of pregnancy (diagnosed
pregnant by rectal palpation prior to treatment), all were confirmed pregnant
by rectal palpation four to six weeks after GnRH treatment.  Of the five cows
treated 30 days after breeding (and therefore presumed to be pregnant), four
were confirmed pregnant by rectal palpation four to six weeks after GnRH
treatment.  The return to estrus by one cow 13 days after treatment was not
considered drug related since this estrus occurred almost exactly two cycle
lengths following breeding, indicating that she had not conceived.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions drawn from the safety study in pregnant cows:</b><p> The results of this
study using a 5X overdosage lead to the conclusion that the administration of
GnRH to sexually mature, pregnant cows presents no hazard of toxicity.<p>

Data from this Dose-Response Confirmation field study were utilized to asses
the effects of 100 &#181;g  dosage vs. 250 &#181;g  dosage on reproductive performance of
cattle with cystic ovaries.  As part of the data generation, the effect of each

Conclusions based on results of this study were that a 2.5X overdosage of

  <b>VI. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
 
GnRH is a naturally occurring peptide in cattle as well as humans and, like
many endocrine hormones, is rapidly broken down into inactive metabolites,
having a half life of 4 minutes in humans (Arimura <i>et al,</i>&#160; 1974. <i>Clin.
Endocrinol.</i>&#160; 3:421; Redding <i>et al, J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab.</i>&#160; 1973. 37:626) and
7 minutes in the rat (Redding &amp; Schally. 1973. <i>Life Sciences.</i>&#160; 12:23).
The action of GnRH is to stimulate the pituitary to release gonadotropins,
chiefly luteinizing hormone (LH) which in turn acts on the ovary causing
ovulation, subsequent luteinization of the follicle, and release of
progesterone.  The most sensitive assay for exogenously administered GnRH is,
therefore, the detection of increased levels of LH in the blood.<p>
 
Since it is a naturally occurring peptide, it is not surprising that background
levels of GnRH, reportedly ranging from 0.5 to 3 ng/mL have been found in
normal milk from untreated cows (Baran &amp; Koch, 1976, <i>Science,</i>&#160; 198:300).<p>
 
The active ingredient in  Factrel&#174; is identical in structure to the naturally
occurring peptide.  In order assure the safety to consumers of milk and meat
from treated cows, studies were focused on determining whether use of this
particular GnRH product as proposed (1) results in GnRH levels in serum milk
that exceed normal background and (2) results in LH levels or subsequent
progesterone levels that exceed those expected from normally cycling cows.<p>

Blood samples were collected before treatment and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120,
150, 180, 210, 240, 270 and 300 minutes and 12 hours after injection.  Milk
samples were collected before treatment and 4, 12, 24 and 28 hours after
treatment.<p>
 
GnRH and LH activity were determined on blood samples and GnRH activity in milk
samples, both by radioimmunoassay.  The sensitivity of the GnRH
radioimmunoassay method, defined conservatively as the quantity of GnRH that
reduces binding of 125-I-GnRH to 90% of B-0 (binding value when no GnRH is
added) was 0.6 pg/mL, corresponding to less than 1 part per trillion.
Additionally, SGOT was determined in blood serum collected before and 12 hours
after treatment to determine whether evidence of muscle damage would be
found.<p>
Results of serum GnRH determinations showed that concentrations of GnRH are
detectable within five minutes after intramuscular injection, reach their
maximum level within 15 minutes and generally return to preinjection baseline
levels by 90 minutes as summarized in the following table:<p>

Results of milk GnRH determinations showed a significant level of GnRH
immunoreactivity in milk of all cows prior to administration of GnRH.  The
background level of GnRH did not increase following treatment with either
product at any dosage tested.  One cow of the 1,000 &#181;g  group had a milk GnRH
concentration of 330 pg/mL before treatment (which declined rapidly at
samplings subsequent to treatment).  The milk GnRH data (above cow excluded)
are summarized in the following chart illustrating that GnRH injection at doses
up to 1,000 &#181;g  (ten times the recommended dose) did not increase GnRH in
milk.<p>

Results of LH determinations in plasma showed an increase in LH following each
of the doses of GnRH given.  The LH response to GnRH was extremely variable,
most likely due to the particular stage of the estrus cycle that each cow
happened to be in at the time of treatment.  The LH results are summarized in
the following table:<p>

Results of SGOT determinations showed no evidence of muscle damage in that SGOT
remained within normal limits in all cows at all doses following treatment.<p>
 
No side effects or other evidence of toxicity of any kind was encountered in
the study.<p>
 
<b>Conclusions drawn from the study:</b><p> Intramuscular injection of GnRH as  Factrel&#174; at
dosages of 100, 250 or 1,000 &#181;g/cow (1X, 2.5X and 10X the recommended dose)
results in blood plasma GnRH concentrations that exceed background
concentrations for only about 90 minutes in cows.  GnRH treatment does not
result in milk GnRH concentrations that exceed background levels after 24 hours
of treatment, even at 10X the recommended dose.  These results are similar to
those demonstrated with the approved reference control GnRH product given at
its recommended dose of 100 &#181;g /cow.<p>
 
Intramuscular injection of GnRH at all doses tested also results in moderate
increases in LH activity in serum as expected, and these LH levels are similar
to those reported during the preovulatory surge in normal cows (7-55 ng/mL,
Echternkamp &amp; Hansel, 1973, <i>J An Sci,</i>&#160; 37:1362).<p>
 
It can therefore be concluded that use of GnRH as recommended does not pose any
health hazard to human consumers of milk or meat from treated cows.<p>
 
<B>B. Effect of GnRH at 1X and 10X Dose on LH and Progesterone in Cows

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of exogenous GnRH on
luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and, additionally, progesterone, in cows.
Since GnRH levels in serum and milk following exogenous GnRH are very low and
transient, LH was chosen as the most sensitive endpoint possible.<p>
<p>
Test substance was  Factrel&#174; (gonadorelin hydrochloride) 50 &#181;g/mL, identical to
that to be marketed.  Control substance was the vehicle only, not containing
GnRH.<p>
 
Test animals included 12 non pregnant, lactating dairy cows at the stage of
lactation when ovarian cysts are common, divided into three groups and given a
single intramuscular injection as follows:<p>

Factrel&#174;, 1,000 &#181;g      4 cows       10X (20 mL, 2 injection sites)  
</pre> 
Blood samples were collected before treatment and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180,
210, 240, 270 and 300 minutes and 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after injection.
Milk samples were taken before treatment and 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after
treatment.  LH and progesterone assays were determined on blood and milk
samples by radioimmunoassay methods.  The sensitivity for LH was 43 +/- 9 pg/mL
for LH.<p>
 
Results of blood serum LH determinations showed that, under conditions of this
study, intramuscular GnRH dosage of 100 &#181;g  elicited only slight release of LH
but these concentrations were not different from those in control cows.
Administration of 1,000 &#181;g  GnRH resulted in an increase in serum LH which
peaked at 1.5 hours at an average of 27.74 ng/mL.<p>

<b>Conclusions drawn from the study:</b><p> Exogenous GnRH injection had only a transient
effect on LH concentrations and no effect on serum or milk progesterone
concentrations.  (Blood progesterone levels range from 0.0 ng/mL to 4.8 +/- .49
ng/mL depending on stage of estrus cycle, Echternkamp &amp; Hansel, 1973, <i>J An
Sci,</i>&#160; 37:1362.) (Progesterone in whole milk ranges from 0 to 20 ng/mL depending
on stage of estrus cycle, Pope, Majklik, Ball and Leaver, 1976, <i>Brit Vet J,</i>&#160;
132:497.)<p>

Inasmuch as LH and progesterone levels remained within the range expected in
normally cycling cows, it can be concluded that use of GnRH as recommended does
not pose any health hazard to human consumers of milk or meat from treated
cows.<p>
 
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
 
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of 512 of
the Act and demonstrate that  Factrel&#174; when used under its proposed conditions of
use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications.<p>
 
The agency has granted an exemption under 21 CFR 201.105 from the requirement
of "adequate directions for use" in section 502(f)(1) of the Act.  Therefore,
labeling will restrict this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed
veterinarian.  This decision was based on the requirement that a differential
diagnosis and monitoring of patient progress requires the professional
expertise of a veterinarian.                    <p>

until 5 days before slaughter.<P>

<b>4. Effectiveness - Pivotal Studies</b><P>

<B>a) Establishment of Dose<P></B>

<B>i) Field Isolate Battery Trials<P></B>

Seventy-three field isolates were evaluated in 41 battery trials totaling 4,305
cockerel chickens, to titrate various levels of maduramicin against single or
mixed infections of <i>Eimeria spp</i>. recently collected from commercial
poultry farms at various geographical locations in North America. Each sample
was analyzed to determine the major and minor <i>Eimeria</i>&#160;sp. which were
present. These trials were conducted by Dr. H. Berger at the Agricultural
Research Center of American Cyanamid Company in Princeton, New Jersey.<P>

Treatments consisted of noninfected, nonmedicated control (NNC), infected,
nonmedicated control (INC) and infected, medicated treatments of 2, 4, 5, 6 or
7 ppm maduramicin. The treatments were replicated three times in each trial,
with 5 birds per replicate.  Ten-day-old broiler cockerels were infected with a
pretitrated inoculum from the field samples which contained a single or mixed
<i>Eimeria spp</i>. Weight gains for the 3 to 7 days postinfection, mortality
(coccidiosis and noncoccidiosis related), and coccidial lesion scores on
termination of the study were determined.<P>

A summary of the data is given in Table 1.<P>

The data were analyzed using Linear Plateau Model Analysis. The statistical
summary of the 41 trials considered coccidial lesion scores 7 days after
infection. Using these parameters, it can be concluded that maduramicin is an
effective anticoccidial against the 6 pathogenic species of <i>Eimeria</i>&#160;
named and that the optimum dosage range is 5 - 6 ppm.<P>

<b>i) Challenge studies</b><P>

<b>Summary:</b><P>

Five challenge floor pen studies were conducted at various geographical
locations in the U.S. to evaluate the anticoccidial effect of maduramicin in
broiler chickens challenged with recently collected field isolates of
<i>Eimeria maxima, E. tenella, E. acervulina, E.  necatrix, E. brunetti,&#160;</i>and<i> E.
mivati.</i> These birds were maintained under use conditions to provide a
simulated field evaluation of the effectiveness of maduramicin.<P>

Broiler chickens in the five studies were exposed to cocddial challenge at 14
days of age by feed and/or litter.  Lesion scores were taken at 7 and 14 days
postinfection (21 and 28 days of age).<P>

In trials 1, 2 and 3, an infected, non-medicated control group was compared
with maduramicin at four dosage levels (4, 5, 6 and 7 ppm).   Trial 1 added an
additional group of birds treated with maduramicin at 8 ppm, and trial 4 did
not have a 7 ppm treatment.<P>

The treated groups received anticoccidial medication in the diets from 0-44
days of age, followed by a 5-day drug withdrawal period on non-medicated feed
prior to final weights. (These birds were discarded and did not enter the human
food chain).<P>

The data from these five (5) trials are summarized in Tables 2-6<P>

In conclusion, maduramicin at 5 to 7 ppm in the diet effectively controlled
coccidial challenge. The optimum dose range is concluded to be 5 to 6 ppm,
since no significant improvement in lesion control was seen from 6 to 7 ppm.<P>

<b>5. Animal Safety - Pivotal Studies</b><P>

<b>a) Target Animal (broiler chicken) Safety</b><P>

<b>i) Floor Pen Safety Study in Broiler Chickens</b><P>

<b>Investigator:</b><P>

In this pivotal study broiler chickens were grown to market age (49 days) under
simulated commercial conditions and fed dietary levels of 0, 5, 6, 7.5, 9 and
15 ppm of maduramicin ammonium. Medication was fed from 0-44 days and followed
with a 5-day medication withdrawal period. There were 8 replicates of 100
chickens of equal sex in each group.<P>

Parameters for determining the safety of maduramicin ammonium in broiler diets
were growth, feed efficiency, mortality, hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit,
RBC and clotting times) and histopathology of various body organs and tissues
as well as effects on pigmentation and feathering. <P>

The Linear Plateau Model analysis of 49-day weight gains indicated that in the
absence of coccidiosis there was a significant dose related decrease in weight
gains (P &lt; 0.05).<P>

Feed efficiency, as determined by feed gain ratios was comparable for
all groups at the end of 49 days, except that the 15 ppm level of maduramicin
ammonium significantly impaired feed efficiency during the medication
period.<P>

Percent mortality for the 9 and 15 ppm groups was higher than for all other
groups by 49 days.<P>

There were no effects on hemoglobin, hematocrit or red blood cell counts in
males or females fed maduramicin ammonium for 44-45 days at levels up to 7.5
ppm. Reduced blood values were seen in males at the 9 and 15 ppm levels
andfemales at 15 ppm at the 44-45 day period.<P>

Blood clotting times ranged from a low of 145 to a high of 1355 seconds, about
the normal variation associated with chicken blood. There were no apparent
trends with regard to treatment at the 44-45 day sampling.<P>

Histopathology of various tissues indicated that changes ascribable to
maduramicin ammonium were apparent in the bursa of Fabricius and thymus.
Partial atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius and of the thymus was an observable
effect at 9 ppm (earliest) and 15.0 ppm (highest frequency).  No other
treatment related microscopic changes were observed. There was no adverse drug
related effect on pigmentation.  At levels above 5 ppm there were reduced floor
feathers at the end of the experiment which is indicative of feather eating by
broilers.<P>

<b>ii. Immunocompetency Study</b><P>

In order to confirm that there was no biological significance to the
histological changes observed in the bursa of Fabricus and thymus in the Floor
Pen Safety study an additional study was conducted to determine
immunocompetency of broiler chickens  fed  dietary  concentration  of
maduramicin ammonium at 5, 7, 10 or 15 ppm in the starter diets during the
first 3 weeks followed by 5 - 7 ppm of maduramicin ammonium during the
remaining study period of 22 - 41 days. Since the Newcastle Disease (ND)
involves both the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of chickens(1) the ND vaccine was selected to test the immunocompetency of maduramicin-
medicated chickens. Newcastle Disease vaccine was given in drinking water at 7
and 21 days of age. A group of chickens served as the nonmedicated,
nonvaccinated control and another group  served as  the  nonmedicated,
vaccinated control. At 31 days of age, all birds were challenged with a
pretitrated dose of ND virus. Blood samples were taken from each bird at 7, 21
and 31 days of age for hemaglutination inhibition (HI) test.  Mortality,
morbidity, weight gain and feed intake were measured during the ND challenge
period.<P>

The HI titers at 21 and 31 days show that maduramicin ammonium medicated birds
developed good primary and secondary antibody response to ND vaccine and their
titers were comparable to those of the nonmedicated, vaccinated chickens.  The
mortality due to Newcastle disease virus challenge in the nonvaccinated
controls was 12/15 (80%). One bird died prior to challenge.  Neither mortality
nor morbitity was observed in any of the vaccinated chickens.<P>

It is concluded that the immunocompetency of chickens treated with maduramicin
ammonium as high as 15 ppm for 3 weeks  followed by 7 ppm  for 3 more weeks was
not compromised.<P>

Data from the study are summarized in tables 8-9 on the following page. There
were 16 chickens per group with 4 replicates of 2 males and 2 females per
replicate.<P>

<b>iii)   Non-Challenge Studies Summary:</b><P>

Five pivotal non-challenge floor pen studies were conducted in various
geographical locations in the U.S. to demonstrate the safety and dose range of
maduramicin in broiler chickens under simulated commercial conditions, in the
absence of coccidiosis.   Maduramicin  was examined at four dosage levels (5,
6, 7 and 8 ppm).<P>

The primary parameters for measuring safety and efficacy of maduramicin  were
weight  gain,  feed  efficiency  and mortality.<P>

The various treatment groups, except the non-medicated control group, received
anticoccidial medication in the diets from 0-44 days of age, followed by a
5-day withdrawal period on non-medicated feed.<P>

The body weight, feed efficiency and mortality of broiler chickens receiving
maduramicin  at  various  levels, was compared to the non-medicated control
group.  There were no significant differences in feed efficiency or mortality
at 49 days of age between broilers receiving either of the four levels of
maduramicin (5, 6, 7 and 8 ppm) and the non- medicated control group.  A dose
related adverse affect on weight gain was seen.  Doses greater than 6 ppm showed
a statistically significant decrease in weight gain as compared to the
non-medicated control group.<P>

Other observations included mortality, feed consumption, pigmentation   and
feathering. Feed consumption, pigmentation and feathering were normal in
all trials.  In trials 1 and 4 which were conducted in the same house,
increased litter moisture was noted in the CYGRO pens.<P>

In summary, it can be concluded from the data in these nonchallenge floor pen
studies that in the absence of coccidiosis, a significant dose related adverse
effect on growth with no improvement in feed efficiency was seen starting at 6
ppm maduramicin ammonium.  No significant adverse effect on growth was seen at
5 ppm maduramicin ammonium.<P>

<b>v. Additional Corroborative Information Concerning Animal Safety</b><P>

CYGRO maduramicin ammonium has been approved and marketed internationally since
1984. It is currently marketed in 28 countries throughout the world, including
most of the major broiler producing countries. Approximately 1.5-2.0 billion
broilers per year are currently receiving CYGRO maduramicin ammonium. No
adverse commercial reports attributable to CYGRO maduramicin ammonium including
unacceptable litter condition, disease outbreaks or poor featbering have been
received.<P>

In addition, to determine the effect, if any, of maduramicin ammonium on fecal
moisture, carefully controlled battery experiments were conducted by Dr. Carey
Quarles of Colorado Quality Research, Fort Collins, CO. These studies of 4
weeks duration with 5 different U.S. broiler diets showed that CYGRO
maduramicin ammonium caused no increase in water consumption or fecal moisture.
These data are shown in the following Table 17.<P>

Additionally, a series of both floor pen and field trials with either 5 or 7
ppm CYGRO maduramicin ammonium in combination with various antibiotics and/or
roxarsone have been conducted  in  support of combination NADAs.  This
information has been submitted under the following NADAs: 140-821, 140-822,
140-823, 140-899, 140-902 and 140888. Nearly 1 million birds were involved in
these studies. No adverse commercial effects attributable to CYGRO maduramicin
ammonium on litter conditions, disease outbreaks or feathering were observed in
any of these studies.<P>

<b>b) Effects on microbial populations</b><P>

<b>i) Antimicrobial Resistance</b><P>

<b>Investigator:</b><P>

D. Fagerberg<br>
CARE, Inc.<br>
Fort Collins, CO<P>

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of maduramicin ammonium fed <i>ad
libitum</i>&#160;to chickens at 7 ppm on antimicrobial resistance of indigenous
coliforms. Fecal samples of medicated and non-medicated birds were collected
prior to treatment initiation for base-lines and weekly thereafter during an
eight week treatment period. Ten coliform isolates per bird per sampling were
tested for susceptibility to amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefoxitin
chloramphenicol, gentamicin kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin,
sulfadiazine, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.<P>

Essentially no antimicrobial resistance was found among indigenous fecal
coliforms of birds in either the non-medicated or the maduramicin treated
group. Therefore, maduramicin ammonium had no effect on coliform antimicrobial
resistance in poultry when administered at 7 ppm in the diet.<P>

<b>ii) Salmonella Shedding</b><P>

<b>Investigator:</b><P>

D. Fagerberg<br>
CARE, Inc.<br>
Fort Collins, CO<P>

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of maduramicin ammonium fed to
chickens at 7 ppm on <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>&#160;shedding  (quantity,
prevalence and duration),  antimicrobial resistance and tissue levels. Fecal
samples of medicated and nonmedicated birds were collected prior to treatment
initiation to assure freedom from indigenous salmonellae. Chicks were orally
inoculated with <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>&#160;at 11 and 12 days of age.
Medicated diet was initiated to the appropriate treatment group five days after
the final challenge and continued throughout the remainder of the eight week
study. Fecal samples were collected 14 times during the 56 day treatment period
and were directcounted for quantities of test salmonellae and enriched for
detection of non-countable levels of test salmonellae. From ten of the
post-challenge sampling periods, five <i>S. typhumurium</i>&#160;isolates per bird
were tested by a microdilution, MIC method for susceptibility to amikacin,
ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin,
nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfadiazine, tetracycline and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All Salmonella-challenged birds were necropsied
at time of death or at study end, and samples of liver, spleen, colon contents
and cecal contents were analyzed for presence of test salmonella.<P>

Maduramicin ammonium had no adverse effect on the quantity, prevalence or
duration of salmonella shedding, nor on antimicrobial resistance of the
salmonella, nor did it have any effect on the presence of test salmonella in
tissues.<P>

<b>6. Human Safety</b><P>

<b>Acute toxicology:</b><P>

<b>Rabbit eye irritation-maduramicin technical</b><P>

Six male rabbits received 0.1 g of the test material in the conjunctival sac of
one eye. Within 24 hours signs of severe conjunctival and corneal irritation
were apparent in all animals. These animals all died by day 7. Three other
rabbits received the test material followed by a 20 second rinse immediately
after instillation. Only mild signs of conjunctival irritation which reversed
by 3 days were observed.<P>

<b>Rabbit skin irritation-maduramicin technical</b><P>

Six male rabbits were patched with 0.2 g of the test material as an aqueous
paste. The occluded patches were held in place for 24 hours, then removed and
the skin was examined for signs of irritation. The primary irritation score
which resulted was 2.9. Two rabbits died 72 hours after application. The
material produces both moderate erythema and edema upon skin application.<P>

<b>Rabbit eye irritation-maduramicin in benzyl alcohol</b><P>

Six rabbits were dosed with 0.1 ml of this mixture instilled into the
conjunctival sac.  All eyes were rinsed after 24 hours. Results showed that the
product was irritating to the cornea, iris and conjunctivae of most animals.
All animals had died by day 4.<P>

<b>American Cyanamid Report A-83-10:</b><P>

The following studies were conducted with the 1% premix formulation which is
the subject of this NADA with the exception that the final premix contained
approximately 5% corn oil.<P>

<b>Rabbit eye irritation-premix</b><P>

A standard dose (0.l g) of formulation was instilled into the conjuctival sac
of 9 rabbits. After 20 seconds the eyes of three of the rabbits were rinsed
thoroughly, white the other 6 rabbits' eyes were washed after 24 hours.  The
animals whose eyes had been washed after 20 seconds showed no signs of
irritation. The animals receiving the 24 hour rinse showed corneal and
conjunctival irritation as well as iritis. All eyes returned to normal before
l4 days.<P>

<b>Rabbit skin irritation-premix</b><P>

A standard dose (0.5 g) of the product as an aqueous paste was held under an
impervious patch for 24 hours on 6 rabbits and the skin was examined and scored
at 24 and 72 hours.   The primary irritation score was 2.0. Moderate erythema
and mild edema were observed which was more pronounced at the abraded sites.<P>

<b>ii. Subchronic Toxicology:</b><P>

<b>American Cyanamid Report L-1966B:</b><P>

<b>Rat 28-day feeding study-maduramicin technical</b><P>

Five rats/sex/group were fed diets containing test material at concentrations
of 4, 6 and 8 ppm for 28 consecutive days.  A control group of 10 rats/sex
received basal diet at the same time. No signs of toxicity were observed at any
treatment level over the course of the study. The no observable effect level,
therefore, was considered to be &gt; 8 ppm, equivalent to 0.87 mg/kg
maduramicin body weight.<P>

<b>American Cyanamid Report L-1983:</b><P>

Rat 13-week feeding study-maduramicin technical<P>

Thirty rats/sex/group were fed diets containing maduramicin at levels of 0, 1,
3, 5, and 7 ppm for 13 weeks. A significant decrease in body weight over the
course of the study was observed for males receiving 7 ppm.   Males receiving 5
and 7 ppm also showed significantly increased relative heart weights as
compared to the controls. For these reasons the no effect level was considered
to be 3 ppm (0.21 mg/kg).<P>

<b>American Cyanamid Report L-l984:</b><P>

<b>Dog 28-day feeding study-maduramicin technical</b><P>

Two dogs/sex were fed diets containing 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 ppm maduramicin for
28 days. No effects were observed in any parameters measured in any animals
receiving 12 ppm or less. The only effect observed in animals receiving 24 ppm
was an intermittent hindlimb weakness/stiffness observed in 2/4 dogs. The
effect was transient and was not seen after 16 days of test material
administration. At 48 ppm ataxia which progressed to hindlimb paralysis was
seen in all dogs. Atrophy, focal degeneration and diffuse sarcolemmal
proliferation of skeletal muscle were observed microscopically in these dogs.
These changes were not observed in the animals receiving 24 ppm. The no effect
level was considered to be 12 ppm.<P>

<b>BioResearch Laboratories Report 50716-maduamicin technical</b><P>

<b>A range finding study to determine doses to be used in the definitive
cardiovascular screening of maduramicin in the beagle dog following single oral
or intravenous administration.</b><P>

Ten dogs (5 male, 5 females) received incremental doses of maduramicin
in ethyl alcohol at about 1 hour intervals in order to find a dose which would
produce an effect and one which would produce no effect. Following each dose
all dogs were monitored for heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, left
ventricular pressure, dp/dt, aortic pressure and cardiac output. Coronary blood
flow was determined at termination. The time course of the response was
determined also. In addition, eight (4 male and 4 female) dogs were fed the
test material in a ball of ground meat and the time course of the response was
again determined measuring the same parameters. The results showed that after
intravenous administration the apparent response was over in about l hour, and
after oral administration the first signs of response could be observed after
about 2 hours. Therefore, the dose levels chosen for intravenous dosing in the
main study were 0.05, 0.20 and 0.60 mg/kg, and for oral dosing 0.5, 2.0 and 6.0
mg/kg. The optimum time to begin data collection in orally dosed dogs appeared
to be l l/2 hours post-dose. The most sensitive parameters measured appeared to
be left ventricular and aortic pressure.<P>

<b>BioResearch Laboratories Report 50724-maduramicin technical</b><P>

<b>Cardiovascular profile of maduramicin in the beagle dog following single
oral or intravenous administration.</b><P>

Three dogs/sex/dose group were administered test material at dose levels of
0.05, 0.20, 0.60 mg/kg (intravenous), and 0.5, 2.0 and 6.0 mg/l (oral) in a
single dose and various cardiovascular parameters were measured. Intravenous
injection of the test material caused an increase in heart rate, left
ventricular pressure, systolic aortic pressure and dp/dt in dogs given a single
dose of 0.60 mg/kg. No significant cardiovascular effect was observed following
injection of 0.20 mg/kg. None of these changes was detected consistently in
dogs given the test material orally at dose levels up to ten times higher than
the IV dose.<P>

<b>Lederle Laboratories Report 36624-maduramicin technical</b><P>

<b>Cardiovascular screening profile</b><P>

The effects of the test material on parameters such as blood pressure, urine
output and renin production were studied in rats.<P>

Isolated heart muscle was examined to determine the effect of perfusion of test
material on contractile force, coronary vasodilatation, etc. Many other
cardiovascular parameters were examined in this study. Results showed that
there was nothing remarkable in the cardiovascular screening profile of
maduramicin.<P>

<b>American Cyanamid Report C-84-1-maduramicin technical</b><P>

<b>Changes in heart rate, ECG measurements and amount of drug in urine measured
at different intervals from dogs injected intravenously with
maduramicin.</b><P>

The purpose of this experiment was to measure heart rate changes,
electrocardiographic recordings and maduramicin residues in urine of conscious
trained beagle dogs intravenously injected with maduramicin in order to find
one or several parameters which can be used for monitoring the degree of
accidental human exposure to maduramicin.<P>

The results of this experiment indicate that the-analysis for determination of
maduramicin residues in the urine is the best parameter which can be used for
monitoring the degree of accidental  human  exposure  to  maduramicin  since
electrocardiographic changes are very slight or not existent.<P>

<b>iii. Teratology and Reproductive Toxicology</b><P>

<b>Toxigenics Study 450-1252:</b><br>
<b>Teratology pilot study in albino rats with with maduramicin-maduramicin

Five females/group were administered the test material in corn oil on gestation
days 6 through 15 at dosage levels of 0 (corn oil only), 1, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg
maduramicin. All females receiving 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg died during the dosing
period. Animals receiving 1 mg/kg showed no signs of toxicity. From the study
dose levels of 0.1, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg were chosen for the definitive study.<P>

<b>Toxigenics Study 450-1253:</b><br>
<b>Teratology study in albino rats with maduramicin-maduramicin

Twenty-five virgin female rats/group were mated and treated with test material
via gavage on gestation days 6 through 15 at dose levels of 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0
mg/kg/day. All females treated with 3.0 mg/kg died prior to gestation day 20.
Animals treated with lower dosages showed no signs of maternal toxicity, and
offspring of these two groups of females showed no signs of teratogenicity.<P>

<b>Hazelton Laboratories study 6123-110:</b><br>
<b>Three generation reproduction study with maduramicin in rats-maduramicin
technical</b><P>

Groups of 12 male and 24 female immature rats were fed diets containing 0, 1, 3
or 5 ppm maduramicin for 71 days. They were then mated twice to produce the F1a
and F1b litters. After a minimum of 100 days of exposure to the same
diets as the parents, the breeding program was repeated with F1b animals to
produce the F2a and F2b pups and with F2b animals to produce the F3a and F3b
pups. The only finding was slight inconsistent body weight changes in adults
and pups which did not interfere with development and had no adverse effects on
the reproductive function of either sex in any of the 3 generations.<P>

<b>iv. Chronic Toxicology</b><P>

<b>BioResearch Laboratories Project 81603:</b><br>
<b>A one-year dietary toxicity study in dogs with maduramicin-technical</b><P>

No observable effects were seen in dogs administered 6 ppm or less for one
year. Target organs seen in higher dose groups were the heart and the eye.<P>

Five beagles/sex/group were fed diets containing maduramicin at levels of 0, 3,
6, 12 and 24 ppm for one year. Two dogs receiving 24 ppm died during the course
of the study. In both cases the cause of death was considered to be congestive
heart failure. Electrocardiograms showed that a significant increase in heart
rate was observed in surviving dogs receiving 24 ppm after l year of study. At
necropsy, a slight increase was seen in the mean (absolute and relative) heart
weights of high dose group dogs, probably related to the ventricular dilation
seen on gross examination. Subsequent microscopic examination of the heart
tissue showed no histological changes that could definitely be attributed to
test material administration. Eye lesions were observed in two females
receiving 12 ppm and three males and five females receiving 24 ppm. In-life
examinations showed the presence of what appeared to be reversible lesions
described as multifocal lesions appearing as water droplets and
hyperreflectivity. Histopathological examination of the eye confirmed
retinal.atrophy in dogs showing hyperreflectivity. The no observable effect
level was 6 ppm (0.204 mg/kg).<P>

<b>v. Genetic Toxicology Summary</b><P>

A battery of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tests directed at assessing
mutagenic/carcinogenic potential (<i>in vitro</i>) and to confirm presence/absence of
mutagenic activity (<i>in vivo</i>) of maduramicin have been undertaken. Such systems
are thought to possess high predictive accuracy for carcinogenicity and hence
constitute a useful tool to obtain data which can be used together with our
toxicological data for the evaluation of the safety of the product.<P>

The <i>in vitro</i>&#160;and <i>in vivo</i>&#160;tests completed with maduramicin
technical are:<P>
1) A bacterial/microsome reverse mutation test (Ames).<P>
2)A Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase
test (CHO/HGPRT).<P>

3) <i>In vitro</i> chromosome aberration analysis in Chinese hamster ovary cells
(CHO).<P>

4) <i>In vivo</i> bone marrow cytogenetic rat metaphase analysis.<P>

5) Unscheduled DNA Synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes.<P>

<b>Ames Test</b><P>

In the Ames test, maduramicln was tested using six bacterial strains (<I>S.
Typhimurium</I>&#160;TA-98, TA-100, TA-1535, TA-1537 and TA-1538 and <I>E. coli</I>&#160;WP-2 uvrA-)
in both the presence and absence of arochlor 1254 - induced rat liver S-9
homogenate. The dose levels in the plate assay ranged from 15.8 to 5000
mcg/plate; the maximum dose level tested for each strain was limited by
solubility or cytotoxicity. In addition, a disc test was performed.
Non-mutagenic responses were obtained for all strains at all dose levels.<P>

<b>CHO/HGPRT Assay</b><P>

In the CHO/HGPRT assay, maduramicin again was tested in both the presence and
absence of S-9. The highest dose level was chosen based on cytotoxicity.  The
dose levels tested ranged from 1 to 100 mcg/ml in the presence of S-9 and from
10 to 150 mcg/ml in the absence of 5-9.  Non-mutagenic responses were again
obtained at all dose levels.<P>

<b>Unscheduled DNA Synthesis in Rat Primary Hepatocytes</b><P>

In this <i>in vitro</i> unscheduled DNA Synthesis Test maduramicin was tested using
rat primary hepatocytes.  Based on the results of an initial toxicity test, the
test article was tested at live dose levels ranging from 0.10 to 4.0 mg/ml.<P>

The results of the UDS assay indicate that under the test conditions, the test
article did not cause a significant increase in the number of labelled nuclear
grain counts and therefore is considered negative in this study.<P>

<b>CHO/Chromosome Aberration Assay</b><P>

In the <i>in vitro</i> CHO/Chromosome aberration assay, the highest dose levels were
again limited by cytotoxicity. Maduramicin was tested in the presence and
absence of S-9 with cultures harvested at two time points, 6-8 hours and 14-18
hours after treatment.  Uniformly non-mutagenic results were obtained for the
6-8 hour sampling time. For the 14-18 hours sampling time, chromosomal breakage
was observed at the high dose level (100 mcg/ml) without S-9, and at the middle
(50 mcg/ml) and high (100 mcg/ml) dose levels in the presence of S-9. The
response at the middle dose level was greater than the response at the high
dose level.<P>

Since the induction of chromosomal aberrations was the only positive response
in an <i>in vitro</i>&#160;mutagenicity test battery, and since <i>in vivo</i>&#160;
systems provide closeness to the physiological and biological complexities of
the intact mammalian organism, it was decided to test CYGRO for its clastogenic
potential using rat bone marrow metaphase analysis system. In this <i>in
vivo</i>&#160;study, CYGRO was tested at intraperitoneally (ip) administered doses
of 0.9, 4.5 and 9 mg/kg; 9 mg/kg was the maximum tolerated dose permitting
adequate metaphase cells for analysis. Bone marrow cells were harvested at 6,
24 and 48 hours after chemical injection for chromosomal aberration analysis.
Negative results were obtained at all dose levels.<P>

Thus positive results obtained under <i>in vitro</i>&#160;conditions are not
corroborated by <i>in vivo</i> evaluation. Also, the <i>in vivo</i> test was performed at
considerably higher doses than could result from potential human exposure.
Greater reliance is placed on results obtained in living animals and it is
concluded that CYGRO does not have genotoxic potential using chromosome
breakage as a genetic endpoint.<P>

<b>b. Safe Concentration of Residues</b><P>

The dog was the most sensitive species with a no-effect level of 0.204
mg/kg/day. Applying a 100-fold safety factor, the safe concentration of
residues is as follows:<P>

<b>c.  Metabolism and Total Residue Depletion Studies, Demonstration of
Withdrawal Time</b><P>

In study PD-M Volume 21-1, six Hubbard x Hubbard broilers were offered feed
medicated with 5.5 ppm carbon-l4 labeled maduramicin ammonium <i>ad libitum</i>&#160;
for 7 consecutive days. The animals were sacrificed on the 0 day of withdrawal
and the appropriate tissues were excised. The total carbon-l4 residue levels of
the tissues are given below:<P>

<B>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 2 columns.)</B><P>
<PRE><B>

               Total Carbon-14

Kidney                 0.22
Muscle                 0.08

</pre>
Extracts of each tissue were subjected to two-dimensional TLC. Maduramicin
ammonium was the most abundant residue found in each tissue. In fat, parent
maduramicin ammonium represented 91.9% of the total residue. 6.4% of the total
residue was observed to co-migrate in the TLC system with the beta-isomer of
maduramicin ammonium. The remaining 1.7% consisted of unidentified minor
components. The beta-derivative is produced by O-demethylation of a methoxy
group in the A ring of maduramicin ammonium.<P>

This metabolite would not be expected to produce toxicity different from that
observed with the parent drug. Therefore, separate toxicity testing of the
metabolite was not required.<P>

In Study A-87-44, male and female broiler chickens were fed diets containing 6
ppm maduramicin ammonium for 44 days. The birds were sacrificed at 0, 1, 2, 3,
4 and 5 days withdrawal and the abdominal fat analyzed using the HPLC/F method
for maduramicin ammonium residues. The results were as follows:<P>

In Study L-2295, carbon-14 labeled maduramicin ammonium was administered to
broilers at a concentration of 6 ppm for seven consecutive days. At the
conclusion of the medication period, chickens were sacrificed on 0, 1, 3 and 5

analyzed via combustion analysis for total radioactivity with the following
results:<P>

        5                               0.102
</pre>
The results of the HPLC analyses obtained from Study A-87-44 were compared with
those of combustion analyses from Study L-2295. At 0, 1, 3 and 5 days of
withdrawal, parent maduramicin ammonium was 78%, 85%, 80% and 81% respectively,
of the total residue.<P>

Based on parent maduramicin ammonium being 80% of the total residue in fat
(safe concentration, 480 ppb) as measured by the HPLC/F method, an R(m) of 380
ppb has been established for the marker residue maduramicin ammonium, in fat,
the target tissue.<P>

The HPLC data from Study A-87-44 was subjected to a statistical analysis (99%
tolerance limit with 95% confidence) to determine the minimum withdrawal
period. Based on this, a minimum withdrawal period of 4 days was calculated. It
should be pointed out, however, that target animal safety and efficacy
considerations will limit the withdrawal period to 5 days.<P>

<b>d. Regulatory Methods</b><P>

The determinative method for quantitating residues of maduramicin in chicken
fat is based on high pressure liquid chromatography. The confirmatory assay is
a Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry procedure.<P>

The determinative and confirmatory methods were validated satisfactorily by FDA
and USDA laboratories. The validated regulatory methods are filed in the Food
Additives Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room
12A30) 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.<P>

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><P>

The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of section
512 of the Act and demonstrate that maduramicin ammonium (CYGRO) at a
concentration ranging from 5 ppm to 6 ppm in finished feed is safe and
effective when fed to broiler chickens for the indications stated in the
product labeling.<P>

Maduramicin ammonium has been subjected to a threshold assessment in accordance
with the procedures contained in the agency's "Guideline for Threshold
Assessment" dated September, 1986. The submitted data are adequate to satisfy
the Agency's food safety requirements. The safe concentration for total
residues in noncooked edible chicken tissues are: 720 ppb in liver; 480 ppb in
skin and 480 ppb in fat.<P>

Based on parent maduramicin ammonium being 80% of total residue in fat, the
target tissue, an Rm of 380 ppb has been established for the marker residue.
The data supports a minimum withdrawal time of 4 days. All studies conducted to
document efficacy of the drug product included a 5-day withdrawal period. This
provides the basis for the established withdrawal time.<P>

Proper use by non-veterinarians can be expected because poultry producers
routinely use medicated feed containing an animal drug for the prevention of
coccidiosis in broiler chickens. Directions are clearly written and there is
reasonable certainty that the conditions of use, including mixing directions,
on the label can and will be followed by the producer. The Agency has concluded
that this product can be approved for over-the-counter use.<P>

Two studies were conducted according to the Agency's guidelines. The dosage
level used in these studies was the previously selected optimum dose of 1.25
mg/pound administered orally one time.  This dosage level was compared to a
non-treatment group.  All cats were necropsied following treatment utilizing a
standard parasitological procedure by removal of the entire gastrointestinal
tract from the stomach to the rectum.  The digestive tract was open and
contents washed over a sieve. The mucosa was also observed for attached worms.
Efficacy was calculated as percent of cats cleared and using the Agency's

induced with <i>Taenia taeniaeformis</i>.&#160;Epsiprantel was administered
as a powder in gelatin capsules at dosages ranging from 0.23 to 13.64 mg/lb.
The drug was considered to have cestocidal activity if the animal stopped
passing gravid segments in their feces (9-10
days post-treatment).  It is recognized that non-terminal studies are useful
but cannot be relied upon for proof of complete efficacy. Bearing this in mind,

<b>4.  European Terminal Dose titration Screening Studies: </b><P>
A dose titration study was conducted by administering a single oral dose of
epsiprantel capsule to 20 naturally infected <i>D. caninum</i>&#160;cats
which were experimentally infected with <i>T. taeniaeformis</i>. Cats were
randomly allocated to treatment groups.  The dose of epsiprantel was calculated
and placed in a capsule.  Cats had a routine parasitic necropsy examination
three to four days after treatment.  This necropsy date is shorter that the USA
guideline calls for but the mucosa was scrapped off and together with washing
from the intestinal tract was washed through a 600 &#161;m sieve.  The
retained debris was then examined under a dissecting microscope at X10
magnification.  The <i>Dipylidium</i>&#160;results are present in Table #20
and the <i>Taenia</i>&#160;results in Table #21. <P>
Table #20 shows that all three dose levels of epsiprantel eliminated all the

swine are slaughtered. <P>
<b>III. Dosage Form:</b>   Medicated Premix <P>
The premix is to be added to the feed such that the complete feed contains 100
grams of tylosin and 100 grams of sulfamethazine per ton. <P>
<b>IV. Summary of Safety and Efficacy:</b> <P>
The safety and efficacy data upon which this application was approved are found
in NADA 12-491 and 41-275 for Elanco Products Company, and are summarized in an 
FOI Summary filed with the Dockets Management Branch under the generic 
name of the drugs. <P>
<b>V. Agency Conclusion:</b> <P>
Approval of this application is based on safety and effectiveness data contained
in Elanco Products Company's approved NADA's 12-491 and 41-275.  Use of the data
in NADA's 12-491 and 41-275 to support this application has been authorized by
Elanco.  This approval does not change the approved use of the drug. 
Consequently, approval of this NADA poses no increased human risk from exposure
to residues of the animal drug, nor does it change the conditions of the drug's
safe use in the target animal species. Accordingly, under the Center's
supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367), this is equivalent to a Category II
supplemental approval which does not require reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness data in the original approval. <P>

</pre>
The Agency is unlikely to object to the use of these substances if the following
conditions are met. <ol>
<li> The substances are used for these indications.                           
<li> The substances are used at the prescribed levels.
<li> The substances are used according to good management practices.
<li> The product is of an appropriate grade for use in food animals.
<li> There is not likely to be an adverse effect on the environment.
</ol>
The Agency's enforcement position on the use of these substances should not be
considered an approval nor an affirmation of their safety and effectiveness.  Based
on the information available at some time in the future, the Agency may take a different 
position on the use of any or all of these substances.
<p>
Classification of these substances as new animal drugs of low regulatory priority
does not exempt facilities from complying with other Federal, State, and local
environmental requirements.  For example, facilities using these substances
would still be required to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  
(NPDES) requirements. <p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

	Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the
Agency will not grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo </i>bioequivalence
study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter; Bioequivalence
Guideline, April 1990).  Bioequivalence of the generic and pioneer products can
be demonstrated by a clinical end-point study.  The ANADA relies on the target
animal safety and drug effectiveness data in the pioneer's New Animal Drug
Application (NADA).<p>

<i>EFFECTIVENESS</i>:<p>

The effectiveness of pyrantel pamoate oral suspension has been established by
data contained in approved NADA 100-237.  The following clinical end point and
palatability studies establish the therapeutic bioequivalence of the generic
Lambert Kay product to the pioneer Pfizer product.<p>

I. Controlled Test (Anthelmintics)<p>

2.	<i>General Design of Study</i>:<p>

a.	<i>Purpose of Study</i>: <p> To demonstrate bioequivalence between Lambert
Kay's formulation of pyrantel pamoate and Nemex(TM), Pfizer brand of pyrantel
pamoate canine anthelmintic.<p>

b.	<i>Test Animals</i>:<p>  A total of 29 dogs of both sexes, mixed breeding and
approximately six weeks of age, were enrolled in the study.  The dogs were
purchased from an essentially helminth-free environment, and showed no evidence
of parasite ova on fecal flotation exams conducted on 3 consecutive days.
There were 10 dogs receiving Lambert Kay's pyrantel pamoate (Group A), 10 dogs
receiving Pfizer's Nemex (Group B), and 9 dogs without treatment as
controls.<p>

c.	<i>Establishment of Parasite Infestation</i>:<p>  Dogs were artificially
infected with embryonated <i>T. canis</i> ova, and with infective L3 larvae of
<i>A. caninum</i>.  All animals were confirmed to have patent <i>T. canis</i>
and <i>A. caninum </i>infections by fecal flotation egg counts conducted
approximately 30 to 60 days after induction of infection.  Fecal flotations for
parasite ova were conducted on Days -11 and -6 relative to treatment day.<p>

d.	<i>Route of Administration</i>:<p>  The treatments were given orally one time
only via disposable syringes directly into the oral cavity to assure
appropriate dosing.<p>

e.	<i>Dosage Used</i>: <p> Dose in study was 1 mL/lb. body weight, equivalent to
2.27 mg pyrantel base/lb.  The test and pioneer drugs were provided in
unlabeled, coded containers.  <p>

f.	<i>Pertinent Parameters Measured</i>:  <p>

i.	Animals were observed for clinical signs of toxicity between dosing and
necropsy.<p>

ii.	All animals were necropsied 72 hours post-treatment and the intestinal
tracts opened and examined for the presence of worms.  All worms were
collected, counted, and identified.<p>

Efficacy was calculated by the following formula:<p>
<pre>
Mean # parasites in untreated controls - mean # parasites in treated controls 
_____________________________________________________________________________  X 100 = % efficacy<p>
                     Mean # parasites in untreated controls

<br>
4.	<i>Conclusions</i>: <p>

Based on the results of this controlled anthelmintic
efficacy trial, Lambert Kay's pyrantel pamoate suspension is bioequivalent to
the pioneer product, Pfizer's Nemex.<p>

5.	<i>Adverse Reactions</i>: <p> 

It was noted that one female dog in Group A
exhibited vomiting approximately 10 minutes after treatment, but the
investigator attributed this to excitement due to handling the animal.  The dog
was retreated uneventfully the next day, and no other toxic signs were
noted.<p>

2.	<i>General Design of Study</i><p>

a.	<i>Purpose of Study</i>: <p>
 Determine if any differences in palatability exist
between Lambert Kay experimental pyrantel pamoate and Pfizer's Nemex.<p>

b.	<i>Test Animals</i>: <p> 

A total of 20 adult dogs of both sexes and mixed
breeding were used.<p>

c.	<i>Dosage Form</i>: <p>

 Oral suspension<p>
 
d.	<i>Route of Administration</i>: <p>
 The treatments were offered orally by
placing into an empty food bowl.  If there was reluctance to consume the drug,
then the dose was mixed with a small quantity of canned dog food.<p>

e.	<i>Dosage Used</i>:<p>
  Dose in study was 1 mL/lb body weight equivalent to
2.27 mg pyrantel base/lb.<p>

f.	<i>Test Parameters</i>:<p>
 The study was conducted as a two-period crossover
design.  Initially 10 dogs received Pfizer's Nemex (Group A), while the
remaining 10 dogs received Lambert Kay pyrantel pamoate (Group B).  Treatments
were reversed the following day.<p>

Time for consumption was recorded from the point when the medication was
initially offered until medication was completely consumed.  For those dogs
which did not consume the medication directly, time was recorded from the
presentation of treated canned dog food until the medicated food was completely
consumed.<p>

All animals fully consumed either the free choice product or medicated canned
food during the two day study.<p>

<br>

4.	<i>Conclusions</i>:<p> There was no clinically significant difference in
palatability between the two product formulations.<p>

5.	<i>Adverse Reactions</i>:<p>  No adverse reactions were observed during this
study.<p>


<i>ANIMAL SAFETY</i><p>

The animal safety of pyrantel pamoate oral suspension has been adequately
demonstrated previously by Pfizer's approved NADA 100-237.<p>

<b>3.	HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>

<b>	Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><p>

Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were
not required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is labeled for use in
non-food animals (dogs).<p>

<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><p>

<b> 2.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
        In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with oxytetracycline.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed).  Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR 558.550.  Oxytetracycline is codified under 21 CFR 558.450.  The
combination of salinomycin sodium and oxytetracycline is codified under 21 CFR
558.450(a) and (d)(1)(v).<p>
<b> 3.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>a.   Tolerances and Safe Concentrations for the Marker Residue</b><p>
The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product.  The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<p>
Tolerances for residues of oxytetracycline are established at 1.0 ppm in the
uncooked muscle, liver, fat, and skin and 3.0 ppm in uncooked kidney of broiler
chickens (21 CFR 556.500).<p>
<b>b.   Withdrawal Time</b><p>
<b></b>Based on the information in 21 CFR 558.450(d)(1)(v), a 24 hour
withdrawal time is required for the combination of salinomycin and
oxytetracycline.<p>
<b>c.   Regulatory Method</b><p>
Under NADA 128-686 a regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because
residue levels in all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were
significantly below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>
The regulatory analytical method for the determination of residue of
oxytetracycline is a microbiological test using <i>Bacillus cereus</i>&#160; var.
<i>mycoides</i>&#160; (ATCC 11778).  The method is published by the Food and Drug
Administration, "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal
Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols", revised October 1968, Reprinted
December 1974.<p>
<b> 4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p> <br>
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of 512(n) of the Act and demonstrates
that the combination of salinomycin sodium and oxytetracycline when used under
the proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled
indications.<p>

<b> 2.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>     
          Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,

animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i>&#160;      bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>     
        Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Phoenix
Pharmaceutical, Inc., was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160;     
bioequivalence study for OXYTETRACYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE.  The generic and
pioneer products contain the same active and inactive ingredients and are
injectable solutions.<p>     
    <b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><br>
            <br>
   <b>Tolerance </b>   <br>
       <br>
       The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.  A tolerance of 0.1 ppm is established for the uncooked edible tissues
of beef cattle, beef calves, non-lactating dairy cattle, and dairy calves
(21&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;556.500(c)).<p>     
  <b> Withdrawal Time</b>    <br>
       <br>
       When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo </i>&#160;     bioequivalence
study is granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the
pioneer product.  The withdrawal time for oxytetracycline HCl injectable
solution is established under 21 CFR 522.1662a:  <b> </b>22 days for cattle.
Not for use in lactating dairy cattle.       <br>
       <br>
  <b> Regulatory Method for Residues</b>    <p>     
The analytical method for the detection of residues of oxytetracycline is a
microbiological test using <i>Bacillus cereus</i>&#160;      var. <i>mycoides</i>     .  This
method may be found in    Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and
Animal Tissues:  Methods, Reports, and Protocols, revised October 1968,
reprinted December 1974.  National Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis,
FDA, Washington, DC  20204.<p>     
<b> 4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b> <br>
      <br>
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that oxytetracycline hydrochloride when used under the proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

<b>	II.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>
<p>Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,
drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue
data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>

Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Rhone
Merieux was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence
study for neomycin sulfate.  The generic and pioneer products contain the same
active ingredient, and no differences in the inactive ingredients which would
affect bioavailability of the active ingredient.  The pioneer and generic
products are administered as oral solutions.<p>

The generic product was the subject of an approved suitability petition
(92P-0255/CP 1), in which the agency granted permission to Rhone Merieux
(formerly Sanofi Animal Health, Inc.), to file an ANADA for changes in the
dosage form and in strength, relative to the pioneer product.  The Suitability
Petition was approved in an agency letter dated August 4, 1992.  The generic
product is formulated as a solution, and the pioneer product is formulated as a
water soluble powder.  The generic product is formulated at 200 mg neomycin
sulfate/mL, and the pioneer  product is formulated at 325 g neomycin
sulfate/pound of product.  The pioneer and generic products will be
administered as oral solutions in water or milk, at a dosage of 10 mg neomycin
sulfate per pound body weight in divided doses for a maximum of 14 days.  <p>

<b>	III.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><p>

<p><i>Tolerance</i> <p>

The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.  A tolerance of 0.25 ppm is established for neomycin residues in the
uncooked edible tissues of cattle, swine, sheep, and goats and a tolerance of
0.15 ppm is established for milk (21 CFR 556.430).<p>

<i>Withdrawal Period</i><p>

When a waiver of <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence testing is granted, the
withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer product. The withdrawal times are 1 day for cattle, 3 days for swine and goats, and 2 days for sheep.<p>

<i>Regulatory Method for Residues</i><p>

The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> suspension.  The
method is published  by the Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues
in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols",
revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974. <p>

<b>	IV.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>

<p>This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that neomycin sulfate oral solution when used under the proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>
Attachments: The following generic labeling and currently approved pioneer
labeling are attached.<p>

	1.	Facsimile package label for NEO 200 Oral Solution for 473.1 mL (1 Pt), and
3.785 L (1 Gal).<p>

	2.	Approved pioneer package label for neomycin sulfate - Neomycin 325 Soluble
Powder for 3.5 oz packages and 50 LB bags.<p>

(FOI) SUMMARY</b><p>
<b>1.   GENERAL INFORMATION:</b><p>
 <b>a.   NADA#: </b> 140-583<p>
<b>b.   NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE SPONSOR:</b><p>
Anthony Products Company<br>
5600 Peck Road <br>Arcadia, CA  91006   <p>
<b>c.   GENERIC NAME OF THE DRUG:</b>  
Repository Corticotropin Injection<p>
<b>d.   TRADE NAME OF THE DRUG:  </b>ACTH Gel <p>
<b>e.   MARKETING STATUS OF THE DRUG:   </b>Rx (prescription)<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>November 14, 1988<p>
<b>2.   INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b><p>
ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulates the production of cortical
hormones by the adrenal cortex. Corticotropin Injection is indicated primarily
for use as a diagnostic aid to test for adrenal dysfunction in dogs.  The
product is also indicated for stimulation of the adrenal cortex, where there is
a general deficiency of ACTH in dogs and cats.<p>
<b>3.  DOSAGE FORM:</b><P>
<b>a.   Injection</b><p>
<b>b.   Route of administration:</b><p>
Intramuscular for diagnostic use in dogs.<p>
Intramuscular or subcutaneous for a general deficiency of ACTH in dogs and
cats.<p>
<b>c.   Recommended dosage:</b><p>
DOGS:<P>
For diagnostic use to test for adrenal dysfunction, one (1) unit per pound of
body weight intramuscularly.<p>
DOGS AND CATS:<P>
For general deficiency of ACTH, one (1) unit per pound of body weight initially
to be repeated as indicated, by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route of
administration.<p>
<b>4.   EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
The application is filed as a generic equivalent to Adrenomone (Repository ACTH
Injection) for the therapeutic claim.  The pioneer product, Adrenomone, was
reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) and found to be effective.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
concurred with the findings that the product was effective.  The notice of
review was published in the FEDERAL REGISTER Vol. 34, No. 91 dated Tuesday, May
19, 1969.<p>
The firm which holds the approval for the parent product, Adrenomone, has
chosen not to market the product for the past 3 years.  Therefore, the parent
product is not available.<p>
The data from a vasopressin activity test demonstrate the bioequivalency of
Anthony's ACTH Gel to the pioneer product reviewed by the NAS/NRC. 
ACTH Gel conforms to the relevant requirements for "Corticotropin for
Injection" USP XXI, p. 250, and is bioequivalent to the pioneer product which
meets the same USP standards for vasopressin activity, potency, and assay.  The
pioneer product was reviewed by the NAS/NRC and judged to be effective for the
therapeutic claim; therefore, Anthony's ACTH Gel is also effective.<p>
The application contains reports of 2 well controlled studies from the
veterinary literature which establish the efficacy of the diagnostic test claim
for ACTH Gel.<ul><p>

Association.</i>  8:707-716; 1982.<p>
The ACTH stimulation test was used an an aid in the diagnosis of spontaneous
hyperadrenocorticism in 57 dogs.<P>
Blood samples were collected from each  dog     for determination of the 
baseline plasma cortisol concentrations.  ACTH gel was administered
intramuscularly at 2.2 IU/kg.  At 2 hours post-ACTH injection, blood samples
were obtained for determination of the plasma cortisol concentrations.
Therefore, the dogs served as their own controls.<p>
Plasma cortisol concentrations were determined by either competitive
protein-binding radio-assay (CPB) or radioiimunoassay (RIA) techniques.<p>
The results of the plasma cortisol assays for the ACTH stimulation test in the
57 dogs with hyperadrenocorticism are summarized as follows:<P>

    The results of the diagnostic test procedure clearly demonstrate that
administration of ACTH gel results in elevation of plasma cortisol
concentration in dogs.  The difference in the magnitude of the      release of
cortisol from the adrenal glands in normal dogs versus      dogs with
hyperadrenocortism makes the ACTH stimulation test a useful     aid in the
diagnosis of adrenal dysfunction.<p>  
<li>b.  Feldman, Edward C. and Peterson, Mark
E:  Hypoadrenocorticism  in     Peterson, Mark. E. (ed.) <i>Veterinary Clinics
of North America [Small     Animal Practice].  </i>Philadelphia:  W.B.
Saunders, July 1984, pp.        751-766. <P>       The ACTH stimulation test was
presented as the best means to confirm      adrenocortical insufficiency.  The
test was described using either     natural ACTH gel or synthetic ACTH.<P>
Blood samples were collected for measurement of baseline cortisol
concentrations in 65 normal dogs and 30 dogs with hypoadrenocorticism.<p>
ACTH gel was administered intramuscularly at 2.2 units/kg.  Blood samples were
collected at 2 hours post-ACTH injection for determination of plasma cortisol
concentration.  Therefore, each dog served as its own control.<p>
Subnormal plasma cortisol concentrations following ACTH stimulation established
the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency.  Dogs with primary or secondary
adrenal insufficiency had baseline plasma cortisol concentrations that were
either normal or below normal, whereas following ACTH stimulation, plasma
cortisol concentrations were below normal and usually similar to the pre-ACTH
injection baseline levels.<p>
The data demonstrated that administraton of ACTH gel produced an increase in
the plasma cortisol concentraton above the baseline values in normal dogs and a
lack of cortisol elevation in dogs with hypoadrenocorticism.<p>
However, to differentiate primary hypoadrenocorticism from secondary
hypoadrenocorticism due to pituitary ACTH failure or chronic iatrogenic
corticosteroid administration, the endogenous plasma ACTH concentration should
be determined.<p>
Many glucocorticoid preparations, including prednisolone, prednisone and
cortisone, cross-react with most cortisol assays to falsely elevate endogenous
cortisol determinations.  Dexamethasone however, has little or no influence on
measurement of endogenous cortisol concentration.  Therefore, the authors
recommended that to ensure reliable results, prednisolone, prednisone, or
cortisone administration should be discontinued 2 to 3 days prior to ACTH
stimulation testing.</ul><p>
Two additional reports from the veterinary literature provided protocols for
the ACTH diagnostic test procedure and interpretation of the results, to assess
adrenal dysfunction in dogs.<ul><p>
<LI>a.   Peterson, Mark E.:  Canine Hyperadrenocortism, in Kirk R.W. (ed.)
<i>Current Veterinary Therapy IX</i>.  Philadelphia:  W.B. Saunders, 1986, pp.
963-972.<p>
The ACTH stimulation test is useful as an aid in the diagnosis of
hyperadrenocorticism in dogs.  Plasma samples are collected for cortisol
determination before and 2 hours after intramuscular administration of ACTH
gel.<p>
Results of the ACTH stimulation test are diagnostic for hyperadrenocorticism
when the cortisol concentration exceeds the upper limit of normal at 2 hours
post ACTH injection.  However, because 85&#37; of dogs with pituitary dependent
hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) and over 50&#37; of dogs with hyperadrenocorticism due
to adrenocortical tumors hyperrespond to the ACTH stimulation test, the test
cannot reliably distinguish between the two.causes of spontaneously occurring
hyperadrenocorticism.  If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected clinically, the
diagnosis should not be excluded based on normal ACTH stimulation test results.
Additional tests, such as the high dose dexamethasone suppression test and the
determination of endogenous plasma ACTH, may be required to differentiate the
causes of spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism.<p>
<LI>b.   Feldman, E.C. and Nelson, R.W.:  <i>Canine and Feline Endocrinology and
Reproduction.  </i>Philadelphia:  W.B. Saunders Co., 1987, pp. 161-163 and
207-209.<p>
The ACTH stimulation test is used as an aid in the diagnosis of
hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's syndrome) or hypoadrenocorticism (Addison' s
disease) in dogs.<p>
Plasma samples are obtained for cortisol determination before and 2 hours
following an intramuscular injection of ACTH gel of 2.2 IU/kg (1 IU/Ib).  The
pre- and post-test cortisol concentrations should be compared with the normal
values established by the diagnostic laboratory.<p>
In the author's laboratory, normal post-test cortisol concentrations have been
determined as between 6 and  17 &#181;g/dl, and cortisol concentrations &gt; or &#61; 20
&#181;g/dl are considered to be consistent with a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism.
The test does not differentiate pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH)
and functioning adrenocortical tumors.  The ACTH stimulation test should be
used as a screening test to diagnose hyperadrenocorticism, as the test has been
shown to identify hyperadrenocorticism in more than half of the dogs with
adrenocortical tumors and in approximately 85&#37; of the dogs with PDH. <p>
 An abnormally low concentration of plasma cortisol 2 hours following
injection of ACTH gel is diagnostic for hypoadrenocorticism in dogs. However,
the ACTH stimulation test does not distinguish hypoadrenocorticism due to
primary adrenal disease from secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary
failure or chronic iatrogenic corticosteroid administration.</ul><p>
<b>5. SAFETY:</b><p>
 The drug is reviewed by NAS/NRC and deemed safe for the therapeutic
claim. FDA concurred with the NAS/NRC findings.  No further safety studies have
been conducted.<p>
The dosage, frecquency, and route of administration recommended for the
diagnostic claim are consistent with the NAS/NRC reviewed therapeutic claim for
the drug.  Therefore, the safety to the target animal is unchanged by the
addition of the diagnostic claim for the drug.<p>
<b>6.   HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
 <b>(a) Human Food Safety: </b><P> Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption
of drug residues in food, were not required for approval of this NADA.  The
drug is approved for use only in dogs and cats, which are non-food animals.<p>
<b>(b) Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration: </b><p>Labeling
contains adequate caution statement (i.e., veterinary prescription legend).<p>
<b>7.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
 Data submitted satisfy the requirements of Section 512 of the Act and
514.111 of the implementing regulations.  The Center for Veterinary Medicine
concludes that this product is safe and effective as labeled for the above
stated indications.  The therapeutic claim, for use in dogs and cats where
there is a general deficiency of ACTH, was NAS/NRC reviewed and was found to be
effective.  FDA concurred with the NAS/NRC findings. 
The diagnostic claim, for use in dogs to test for adrenal dysfunction, was
established in two adequate and well controlled studies published in the
veterinary literature (see references 1 and 4 in section 8).<p>
ACTH Gel (Repository Corticotropin Injection) is used as a diagnostic aid to
test for adrenal dysfunction in dogs and for therapeutic purposes where there
is a general deficiency of ACTH in dogs and cats.  The indications for use of
ACTH Gel require diagnosis by a licensed veterinarian.  Therefore, ACTH 
 Gel is a prescription new animal drug.<p>

Ausa International Inc.<br>
Rt. 8, Box 324-12,<br>
Tyler, TX 75703.<P>
<b>Established Name:</b> Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)<P>
<b>Trade Name:</b> SUPER-OV&#174; <P>
<b>Marketing Status: </b>Rx<P>
<B>Date of Summary:</B> August 13, 1993<P>
<b>2.INDICATIONS FOR USE</b><P>
SUPER-OV&#174; is indicated for the induction of
superovulation in cows for procedures requiring the production of multiple
ova at a single estrus. SUPER-OV&#174; is effective only in cows
that are not pregnant and have a normal corpus luteum, i.e. those cows that
are cycling normally.<P>
<b>3. PRODUCT INFORMATION</b><P>
<b>A. Dosage Form</b><P>
SUPER-OV&#174; is derived from porcine pituitary glands and is
available in one package size: 75 unit (NIH-FSH-S1) vial of powdered drug. Each
vial is reconstituted with one vial of SUPER-OV&#174;  DILUENT. A vial
of diluent and powdered drug are packaged together.<P>
<b>B. Route of Administration:</B> Intramuscular injection<P>
<B>C. Recommended Dosage</b><P>
SUPER-OV&#174; is administered at a dosage of 12.5 units (1.6
mL of the reconstituted solution) twice a day approximately 12 hours apart for
3 days, for a total dose of 75 units (NIH-FSH-S1). To effect regression of the
corpus luteum, a prostaglandin should be administered according to the
manufacturer's instructions at the time of the fifth SUPER-OV&#174;
injection.<P>

<b>(1 )  Dose Determination (Unit and Duration) Studies</b><P>
<b>(a) DOSE TITRATION STUDY</b><P>
A dose titration of 3 levels was completed. Sixty commercial cows of
dairy (Holstein) or mixed beef breeds, ranging in age from 2 to 8 years, were
divided by breeds and subdivided into 3 treatment groups. These groups received
a total FSH dose of 37.5, 75 or 150 units (NIH-FSH-S1). The total dose of FSH
was equally divided over
8 intramuscular injections and was given at 12 hour intervals for 4 days. A
control group (zero drug level) was not required for this study, because the
difference between the low dose and higher doses was expected (and confirmed)
to be statistically significant. In addition, the expected rate of multiple
ovulations in the bovine is low(1).<P>
Estrus was induced with a 2 mL (500 mcg) dose of cloprostenol sodium
administered at the time of the fifth SUPER-OV&#174; injection. Cows
were inseminated with one straw of semen from 4 to 22 hours after the detection
of estrus. Routine nonsurgical embryo collections were performed 7 days
following insemination.<P>
Parameters measured were total and transferable embryo production. These
parameters were measured following a microscopic evaluation and grading of the
ova and embryos collected.<P>

The standard deviations were large indicating that the transferable and total
embryo production data were not normally distributed. The data was transformed
and an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the data. Treatment
differences were significant for both transferable (p=0.0158) and total ova and
embryos (p=0.0001). The 37.5 unit dose of SUPER-OV&#174; produced
fewer ova and embryos (2.5/4.2) than did the 75 (6.0/12.15) and 150 (5.3/8.8)
unit doses. There were no breed differences in embryo production
(P&gt;0.05).<P>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
Based on the results of the study, 75 NIH units was selected as the appropriate
dose because it performed better than 37.5 units and there was no improvement
with the higher dose of 150 units. There were no differences detected in the
response to treatment by breed of cattle.<P>

The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of the selected dose of
SUPER-OV&#174; (75 units FSH) administered over 3 or 4 days in either
once or twice daily injections.<br>
 <P>
Eighty heifers, about 2 years of age, were selected on the basis of body
size from a large group of crossbred beef heifers (Brahma cross) housed in a
feed lot. The heifers were observed for 2 weeks, and those seen in estrus were
examined by rectal palpation and selected for study if their reproductive
tracts appeared to be normal.<P>
The heifers were randomly allocated to treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial
experiment with the variables being days of SUPER-OV&#174;
treatment (3
or 4) and number of times treated per day (1 or 2). Treatment was started
between days 8 and 14 of their cycle. The total dose of SUPER-OV&#174;
was held constant at 75 units. In the 3 day, twice a day (morning and
evening) group, animals received 12.5 units FSH at each injection (6 total
injections, 75 total units FSH). In the 4 day, twice a day (morning and
evening) group, animals received 9.4 units FSH at each injection (8 total
injections, 75.2 total units FSH).<P>
The heifers received a prostaglandin (2 mL (500 mcg) of cloprostenol sodium)
injection on the third day of treatment to induce estrus. Heifers were
artificially inseminated 12 to 18 hours after observation of estrus. Animals
not observed in estrus were bred 60 hours after the prostaglandin injection.
Ova and embryos were collected 7 days after breeding by a technique equivalent
to surgical embryo collection, but performed at slaughter, rather than in the
standing animal.<P>
The primary response parameters were the number of transferable embryos and
percent of transferable embryos (collected at slaughter).<P>

</pre>
Not all animals entered in the study were acceptable at necropsy. Any animal
that was not seen in estrus after superovulation and with ovaries that did not
contain 7 day old corpora lutea at necropsy was excluded from analysis.<P>
No statistically significant treatment differences were found between number of
days, number of injections per day, or the interaction of days and injections
for the number of transferable embryos. No statistically significant treatment
differences were found between number of days or the interaction of days and
injections for the percent of transferable embryos. However, a statistically
significant treatment difference was found between the number of injections per
day (p= .03) with 2 injections per day better than 1 for the
percent of transferable embryos.<P>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
In heifers receiving a total dose of 75 units of FSH, the animals dosed twice a
day for 3 or 4 days had a statistically significant higher percent of
transferable embryos than those animals dosed once a day for 3 or 4 days. No
advantage was seen for 4 days of twice a day treatment over three days of twice
a day treatment, therefore, 12.5 units of SUPER-OV&#174; ,
administered twice a day for 3 days, for a total dose of 75 units, was selected
as the appropriate dose.<P>
<b>(c) FSH AND PROSTAGLANDINS IN THE SUPEROVULATION OF CATTLE</b><P>
The purpose of this study was to determine if FSH and prostaglandins are
both necessary for superovulation of cows and to determine whether the effects
obtained differ between dairy (Holstein) and beef type cows.<P>
Forty commercial cows of dairy (Holstein) or mixed beef breeds, ranging in age
from 2 to 8 years, were used. Animals were allocated to groups on the basis of
a 2 x 2 factorial design with randomized sub-groups. Two levels of FSH
(0 and 75 units) and 2 levels (0 and 2
mL (500 mcg)) of cloprostenol sodium were each administered alone and in
combination with one another to groups of dairy (Holstein) only and beef only
cattle (8 total treatment groups). Injections were administered
intramuscularly. The total dose of FSH was equally divided over 8 injections
and given at 12 hour intervals for a period of 4 days. The cloprostenol sodium
was given at the time of the fifth FSH injection. Individual animal FSH
superovulation treatment was begun from 8 to 13 days after estrus was observed
and was continued for 4 days. There were 2 (1 beef and 1 dairy (Holstein))
untreated control groups included in the study (0 units FSH and 0 mL
cloprostenol sodium).<P>
Cows were inseminated with one straw of semen 4 to 24 hours after the detection
of estrus. Cows not detected in estrus were inseminated at the expected time
relative to expected ovulation, if a positive response had been achieved. Ova
and embryos were collected non-surgically 7 days after insemination. Parameters
measured were total (ova and embryo) and transferable embryo production.<P>

</pre>
Cattle type (i.e., beef or dairy) had no effect on embryo production
(P=0.7363), therefore, the breeds could be combined by treatment group. The
data was transformed for analysis.<P>
Both SUPER-OV&#174; and cloprostenol sodium (a prostaglandin) had
highly significant effects upon transferable and total embryo production (P&lt;
0.0001) with highly significant interactions
(P&lt; 0.0001 ). There was no superovulatory response unless both treatments
(FSH and prostaglandin) were used.<P>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
FSH and prostaglandins function together to achieve a superovulation
response in cattle. Therefore, the product will carry the label statement that
the 2 hormones should be administered together, as described under
Dosage and Administration. There were no response differences noted between
types of cattle.<P>
<b>B. SUPPORTIVE STUDIES</b><P>
<b>(1 )  FSH IN CATTLE FOR 3, 4, OR 5 DAYS</b><P>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 3 durations of
treatment with 1 level of FSH when used to produce superovulation in cows and
to determine whether the effects obtained differ between Holstein and beef-type
cows.<P>
Sixty commercial cows of dairy (Holstein) or mixed beef breeds, ranging in age
from 2 to 8 years, were acquired. Animals were grouped by breed and
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The cows received 2 FSH injections,
beginning 8 to 13 days after estrus, each containing 9.375 units FSH, as a
fixed dose, daily for a period of 3, 4, or 5 days. The FSH dose used (9.375
units twice a day) was determined in another study (DOSE TITRATION STUDY). Thus
cows treated for 3 days received 56.25 units, cows treated for 4 days received
75 units, and cows treated for 5 days received 93.75 units of FSH. To induce
estrus, cloprostenol sodium (500 micrograms, 2 mL) was administered
concurrently with the fourth injection of FSH. Cows were inseminated 4 to 22
hours after the detection of estrus with 1 straw of frozen semen.<P>
Embryos were collected 7 days after insemination by the standard
nonsurgical technique. Pertinent parameters measured were total and
transferable embryo production.<P>

</pre>
Duration of treatment has a highly significant effect on embryo production.
Three days is less effective than 4 or 5 days at this fixed dose. There were no
significant breed effects or significant interactions.<P>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>The study results indicated comparable efficacy for SUPER-OV&#174;
administered at a total dose of 75 units given over 4 days or a total
dose of 93.75 units given over 5 days. This supports the choice of 75 units as
the optimum total dose, since there is no advantage to an increased dose.<P>
<b>C. CLINICAL FIELD TRIALS FOR SUPER-OV&#174;.</b><P>
<b>(1) PIVOTAL</b><P>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the selected dose of 12.5
units of SUPER-OV&#174;  twice a day for 3 days for the superovulation
of cattle by independent operators under field conditions. In addition, the
effects of the three prostaglandin products used in the study were evaluated. A
control group (zero level of drug) was not required for this study, because in
the normal bovine the rate of ovulation 86.9%(1) of the time is a
single ovum.<P>
In the 3 x 2 trial, 122 cows of various ages and of beef and dairy breeds were
superovulated by 5 investigators (one investigator conducted studies at
2 separate sites). The parameters measured were total and transferable embryo
production.<P>
Cows were superovulated with a total dose of 75 units of SUPER-OV&#174;
given intramuscularly in 6 equal doses 12 hours apart. The first
treatment was given 8 to 13 days after estrus was observed. A prostaglandin
injection was given concurrently with the fifth SUPER-
OV&#174; injection. Prostaglandins used in this study included
dinoprost tromethamine (dose 25 to 50 mg), cloprostenol sodium (dose 500
micrograms), or fenprostalene (dose 1 mg). Cows were inseminated with one or
two straws of frozen semen 4 to 22 hours after the detection of estrus. Ova and
embryos were collected by standard non-surgical technique 7 days after
insemination, and classified by their microscopic appearance as transferable
embryos, non-transferable embryos, and unfertilized ova. The group
classification of total ova and embryos include all those listed above.<P>
Three prostaglandin products were selected by the investigators and nothing was
done to control this variable. The investigator used the prostaglandin that was
normally used in the practice. The effects of the prostaglandin used on the
transferable/total embryos produced are presented in Table 2 (the prostaglandin
used was not reported in 1.6% Of the cases).<P>One investigator, Dr. J. Wiltbank, superovulated cows at two locations and his
results are listed separately at each location. Following is a list of the

</pre>
These
122 cows produced a mean (&#177;S.D.) of 4.9&#177;5.6
transferable embryos from 7.1&#177;7.1
total embryos. All 3 prostaglandins were not equally effective in the
superovulation of cattle in these studies. A significantly reduced number of
transferable embryos were produced when fenprostalene was used as the
prostaglandin in the superovulation process. Therefore, the following statement
is found on the label:<P>
There is an inherent failure rate in the superovulation of cattle. In studies,
with multiple investigators, using 12.5 units of SUPER-OV&#174;  twice
a day for 3 days, with dinoprost tromethamine or cloprostenol sodium as the
luteolytic agent, 20-35 % of the cows treated failed to superovulate. In cows
treated by a single investigator, with fenprostalene as the prostaglandin, a
higher failure rate was observed. Higher doses of SUPER-OV&#174;  did
not increase the success rate of the procedure and should not be used. See the
SAFETY AND TOXICITY section.<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>SUPER-OV&#174;  administered at a total dose of 75 units
divided into 6 equal doses and administered at 12 hour intervals over 3 days is
a safe and effective superovulation drug. In a study of this size, we cannot
definitively determine the role of prostaglandins in the variable response
(measured by total and transferable embryos and ova) to superovulation, but in
this study there is a trend of decreased response in those animals which
received fenprostalene as the prostaglandin to induce luteolysis.<P>

Superovulated cows came mainly from other study treatments, namely the
dose-response study, efficacy studies, and the duration - efficacy studies.
Fifty-one cows (29 beef and 32 Holstein) that had been superovulated comprised
the superovulated group. Fifty-four cows (33 beef and 22 dairy) from an
experimental herd that had not been superovulated were randomly selected and
allocated to the experiment as controls.<P>
All cows, superovulated and control, were turned out in a single pasture with 4
bulls for 6 weeks. The bulls were semen tested and found to be normal. Each
bull was seen successfully serving a cow. Cows were rectally palpated for
pregnancy and were not rechecked. The pregnancy checks were used to determine
those cows which cycled, were bred and conceived, and a pregnancy rate for the
mating period.<P>
In a separate clinical setting in Dr. Vrendenberg's practice, 8 superovulated
cows were bred back naturally.<P>
<b>RESULTS</b><P>
The first cycle pregnancy rates for control and superovulated cows were 61.1%
and 68.6% (P=0.548); on the second cycle 61.9% and 64.7% (P=0.873); and for the
six weeks breeding 85.2% and 88.2% (P=0.863).<P>
No breed effects were detected, pregnancy rates being 90.2% and 81.2% (beef vs.
Holstein, P=0.342)<P>
In the 8 cows bred in Dr. Vrendenberg's practice, 6 (75%) became pregnant on
the first service and 2 (25%) on the second service.<P>
<b>(2)  Artificial Breeding</b><P>
Eighteen cows that were superovulated with 75 units SUPER-OV&#174;
were bred back by artificial breeding at the first estrus subsequent to
the superovulation. These cows were pure-bred beef cows that were entered into
a commercial embryo transfer program.<P>
Twenty-eight cows were superovulated and rebred artificially by Dr. Atteberry
under clinical conditions.<P>
<b>RESULTS</b><P>
For the 46 cows, the pregnancy rate on the first insemination was 40/46 or
86.9%, and on second insemination 3/4 or 75.0%.<P>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
This study indicated that superovulation did not have a negative effect on
fertility at the breeding, natural or artificial, subsequent to superovulation
and that there were no breed effects in the natural breeding group. This study
demonstrates that a single superovulation does not have an adverse effect on
subsequent fertility, but does not address the issue of repeated superovulation
on subsequent fertility. Therefore, the following statement is found on the
label under the heading, WARNINGS:<P>
The long term effect of SUPER-OV&#174; and the effect of
SUPER-OV&#174; on the fertility of cattle at higher than recommended
doses, for extended periods, or for multiple treatments in an individual, has
not been assessed.<P>
<b>B. THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL DOSE LEVELS OF SUPER-OV&#174;  ON EMBRYO
RECOVERY AND REPRODUCTIVE TRACT MORPHOLOGY.</b><P>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of
SUPER-OV&#174; at 4 dose levels on the morphology of the reproductive
tract, specifically ovarian weight and the number and size of corpora lutea and
follicles and to relate these parameters to dose of SUPER-OV&#174;
and to embryo production.<P>
Fifty-five heifers were selected from a group of beef heifers. They were
examined by rectal palpation and were selected if their reproductive tracts
appeared to be normal, and they were cycling. Thirty heifers were used in
control groups. Twenty-five were used in the treatment groups. The groups are
found in the following table.<P>
<B>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 4 columns.)</B><P><PRE><B>
SUPER-OV&#174; DOSE  NUMBER OF COWS     NUMBER OF      NUMBER OF DAYS

  0 Units                 20           2 injections          4 days
 75 Units                 17           2 injections          4 days
 56 Units                  6           2 injections          4 days
112 Units                  6           2 injections          4 days
187 Units                  6           2 injections          4 days

</pre>
Groups receiving 1 of 4 different doses of SUPER-OV&#174;  (56, 75,
112, or 187 units) were compared with an untreated (no SUPER-OV&#174;)
control group. All of these groups received norgestomet ear implants to
synchronize estrous cycles. To establish that norgestomet did not affect embryo
production or the number of corpora lutea, two additional control groups were
used. One group remained untreated (no SUPER-OV&#174; or norgestomet)
and one group received 75 units SUPER-OV&#174; (no norgestomet).<P>
Heifers were implanted with a synthetic progestin (norgestomet) on day 1. On
day 8 the cows were started on an injection series of 8 SUPER-OV&#174;
injections 12 hours apart. Cloprostenol sodium (3 mL (500 mcg)) was
administered at the time of the fifth SUPER-OV&#174;  injection in
order to induce estrus. On day 11 at the time of the seventh SUPER-OV&#174;
injection, the ear implants were removed. The heifers were bred by
artificial insemination 4 to 22 hours after being observed in estrus, or at 60
hours post-cloprostenol injection, if no estrus was observed. Injection sites
were marked and shaved in selected animals.<P>
Control heifers were treated with SUPER-OV&#174;  diluent only, and 10
were treated with an ear implant. All were treated and bred as described for
the treated groups. Ten heifers were treated with 75 units of SUPER-OV&#174;,
but did not receive an ear implant.<P>
Seven days after breeding, cows were slaughtered. Injection sites were examined
for signs of tissue reaction, and tissue samples were taken from 10 animals (3
diluent treated and 7 SUPER-OV&#174; treated) for histologic
examination. The reproductive tracts were collected for embryo recovery and
examination of tissues.<P>
Parameters measured included the number of corpora lutea, corpus luteum weight,
number of follicles, and total and transferable embryo production. The
reproductive tracts were examined grossly at necropsy.<P>
<b>RESULTS</b><P>
There were no gross effects of SUPER-OV&#174;  detected on the
reproductive tract (uterus, oviducts, cervix, or anterior vagina), except for
those described below which were found in the temporary ovarian structures
(follicles and corpora lutea). No samples were taken for histology from the
reproductive organs.<P>
The data from 2 cows were excluded because they were not seen in estrus
and their ovarian morphology confirmed that they did not satisfy the terms of
the study.<P>
There was no norgestomet effect on number of corpora lutea, transferable
embryos, or total embryos, and there were no significant interactions.
Therefore, the data could be pooled for further analysis.<P>
Progressively increased doses of SUPER-OV&#174;  changed ovarian
morphology by increasing the number of corpora lutea and large follicles and
decreasing corpus luteum size and the number of small follicles.<P>
Controls (0 dose) produced fewer corpora lutea than all other doses and fewer
transferable embryos (0.5&#177;0.7)
than 56 units (5.7&#177;6.3) or 75 units (3.2&#177;3.6).<P>
Controls produced fewer total embryos (0.9&#177;0.6)
than all other doses. Doses of 56 (12.7&#177;8.0) and 112 units (14.5&#177;8.8)
produced more total embryos than the 75 units dose (4.5&#177;4.5), but a lower
percentage of them were transferable as indicated in the text below.<P>
The percent of transferable embryos (used as a measure of quality) was higher
in the control (50&#177;52%) and the 75 unit dose (71&#177;28%)
groups. The percent transferable embryos was lower in the other dose groups (56
units, 32&#177;31%;112 units, 33&#177;39%;
187 units, 45&#177;51%).<P>
Ovarian weight for 0 dose was less than for all other doses. The increase in
ovarian weight with SUPER-OV&#174; treatment was due to an increase
in the number of corpora lutea and total corpus luteum weight. Total number of
follicles (unadjusted for size of follicle) was unchanged by SUPER-OV&#174;
treatment.<P>
Small follicles (2-5mm in diameter) on control (0 dose) ovaries were reduced by
SUPER-OV&#174; treatment. There were dose effects on follicles 6-7mm
in diameter, particularly in the 75 unit dose. Numbers increased from 0.4&#177;0.6
for controls to 2.8&#177;2.4 for 75 units and 3.7&#177;5.3 for 187 units. However,
there were fewer of these follicles in the 112 unit treatment (0.7&#177;1.2)
than in the 75 or 187 unit treatments.<P>
Follicles of the next size category (8-10mm) were increased in number by
SUPER-OV&#174; treatment, but larger follicles (diameter 11-15mm)
were unaffected. There were increases in the number of largest follicles
(&gt;15mm in diameter) in cows treated with SUPER-OV&#174;  from 0.2&#177;0.4
at 0 levels to 2.3&#177;2.7 at 187 units.<P>
The injection sites were inspected at post-mortem, about 8 days after the last
injection. Three mild inflammatory reactions were seen and were attributed to
infectious agents introduced by the needle. Ten injection sites were examined
histologically, 3 diluent treated controls, and 7 SUPER-OV&#174;
treated animals. No abnormalities were found.<P>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>SUPER-OV&#174; was tested at dose rates sufficient to cause
overstimulation. SUPER-OV&#174; at the dose rates tested (0 to 187
units) changed ovarian morphology by decreasing the individual corpus luteum
weight and increasing the number of corpora lutea and large follicles
(temporary ovarian structures). An increased ovarian weight and a reduced
number of transferable embryos occurred at the higher doses.<P>
SUPER-OV&#174; at the elevated dose rates tested caused a reduction
in transferable embryos. At the recommended dose SUPER-OV&#174; is
safe for the superovulation of cattle.<P>
No evidence of irritation at the injection sites, attributable to
SUPER-OV&#174;, was detected in this study, therefore, this product
does not warrant a trim-out statement on the label. There was also no evidence
of a SUPER-OV&#174; effect on the morphology of the permanent
structures of the reproductive tract (uterus, oviducts, cervix, or anterior
vagina).<P>
<b>C. 10X DRUG TOLERANCE TEST OF SUPER-OV&#174; INTRAMUSCULARLY
ADMINISTERED TO DAIRY CATTLE.</b><P>
This study was conducted to demonstrate the target animal safety of
SUPEROV&#174; intended for use in dairy cows. Three nonpregnant
clinically healthy dairy (Holstein) cows, judged to be reproductively normal,
were used for the study. SUPER-OV&#174;  was administered at a dose of
93.75 units twice daily at 12 hour intervals for 4 consecutive days (750 total
units), a dose which is 10 times the use rate of 75 units.<P>
Animals were euthanized by intravenous injection of a euthanizing agent. One
cow was necropsied on day 3 following estrus, one on day 9, and one on day 20
(assuming that estrus occurred 1 day following the last SUPER-OV&#174;
injection.<P>
Parameters measured were complete physical examinations, body weights, clinical
observations (including rectal temperatures, behavior, appetite, respiration),
feed consumption, clinical pathology tests including comprehensive hematology
and serum biochemistry, and postmortem examinations of reproductive tract and
injection sites.<P>
<b>RESULTS</b><P>
Reproductively, the cows were judged to be normal prior to treatment. Changes
noted following treatment included only the temporary ovarian structures
(follicles and corpora lutea), and not the structural parts of the reproductive
tract (uterus, oviducts, cervix, vagina, and mammary gland). The numbers and
sizes of the ovaries and their structures are found in the table below:<P>

</pre>
No abnormalities were seen pre- or post-treatment in hematological values or
serum profiles.<P>
Microscopic lesions of injection sites included a single observation of
sarcocystis resulting from sarcosporidia parasites in this cow. One injection
site was represented, microscopically, by a mild focal hemorrhage. Another
injection site grossly had evidence of subcutaneous hemorrhage and edema, which
was not confirmed microscopically.<P>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The 10X (750 units FSH) dose administered over a 4 day period appeared to have
no observable toxic effects based on the ante-mortem or post-mortem parameters
evaluated in this study.<P>
<b>6.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><P>
<b>a) Toxicity studies:</b><P>
Follicle stimulating hormone is not orally active; therefore, residues of
follicle stimulating hormone are safe for human consumption, and toxicological
studies were not required.<P>
<b>b) Residue studies:</b><P>
As there was no requirement for toxicological testing, tissue residue studies
were not required and there is no tolerance, withdrawal period, or regulatory
method for SUPER-OV&#174;  (follicle stimulating hormone)<P>
<b>7. PATENTS</b><P>
Patent #4,780,451 entitled "Composition and method for producing
superovulation in cattle" expires October 25, 2005. Patent # 5,162,306
entitled "Composition and method for producing superovulation in mammals"
expires October 25, 2005.<P>
<b>8. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this original NADA satisfy the requirements of
section 512 of the act and demonstrate that SUPER-OV&#174; follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH), when used under its proposed conditions of use is
safe and effective.<P>
The agency has granted an exemption under 21 CFR 201.1 05 from the requirement
for "adequate directions for use" in section 502 (f)(1) of the act for the FSH
injection for intramuscular administration. Therefore, labeling will restrict
this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. This decision
was based on the following factors: (a) the process of superovulation should be
undertaken only by those trained and qualified to perform embryo recovery and
possible transfer, (b) the manipulation of the cow for superovulation requires
an extensive knowledge of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology (including the use
of other prescription drugs), biochemistry, endocrinology, and the use of
aseptic technique, and this knowledge base is part of the training of the
licensed veterinarian, and (c) the drug requires reconstitution for use.<P>
No slaughter withdrawal or milk discard period is required for the use of 75
units of follicle stimulating hormone in heifers and cows.<P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this approval qualifies for 3 years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or
residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.<P>

 <b>IV. Summary of Safety and Efficacy:</b><p>
The safety and efficacy data upon which this application was approved are found
in NADAs 10-918 and 11-948 for Elanco Products Company, and are summarized in
an FOI Summary filed with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305) under the
generic name of the drug.<p>
 <b>V. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
Approval of this application is based on safety and effectiveness data
contained in Elanco's approved NADAs  10-918 and  11-948. This approval does
not change the approved use of the drug. Consequently, approval of this NADA
poses no increased human risk from exposure to residues of the animal drug, nor
does it change the conditions of the drug's safe use in the target animal
species.  Accordingly, under the Center's supplemental approval policy (42 FR
64367), this is equivalent to a Category 2 supplemental approval, which does
not require reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the original
applications.<p>

E)<p>
<b>L.  Date of Summary:</b>  October 20, 1995<p>
<b> II. BIOEQUIVALENCY STUDY</b><p>
Bioequivalence was determined on the selenium component of the combination
product.  Vitamin E and selenium are synergistic in their therapeutic effects.
The Vitamin E level in the product is relatively low in relation to nutritional
requirements and is not readily quantifiable in the blood.  Because Vitamin E
and selenium are synergistic in their therapeutic effects, the Agency concluded
that the bioequivalence of the combination product could be determined based on
the blood level bioequivalence of the selenium component alone.  A description
of the bioequivalency study in selenium follows.<p>
    <b> A. Investigators</b>:<p>       Fort Dodge Laboratories was the Sponsor of
this study and              the Study Director/Investigator was Dr. Robert Pollet  of
Fort Dodge Laboratories, 800 5th Street N.W., Fort Dodge,               Iowa  50501.<p>
                        The analytical determination of selenium in serum samples               was
conducted by Hazleton Laboratories, 3301 Kinsman                Boulevard, Madison,
Wisconsin  53704.  <p>
        <b>B.   General Design of Investigation</b>: <ul><p>
                <li><b>1.  Purpose of Study</b><p>
The purpose of the study was to assess the <i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalency of two
(2) injectable formulations of a Vitamin E/Selenium product in cattle.  These
two (2) products are the pioneer product and the generic product, which is the
subject of this application.<p>
<li><b>2.   Test Animals</b><p>
A total of twenty (20) healthy cross-bred beef feeder calves (15 males and 5
females) were used.  The weight of the calves was between 435 to 700 pounds.<p>
<li><b> 3.  Study Design</b><p>
The study was conducted as a cross-over design; each formulation was given to
an equal number of animals during two separate periods.  During each treatment
period, ten (10) calves received the pioneer (FDA approved) product and ten
(10) calves received the test product.  After the first treatment there was a
14-day washout period before administration of the second treatment.  During
the second dosing period, the treatments were crossed-over, such that each calf
received both the pioneer (MuSe&#174;) and the Fort Dodge Laboratories products.
<p>
<li><b>             4.  Route of Administration</b><p>
The pioneer product is labeled to be administered by subcutaneous or
intramuscular injection.  In this bioequivalency study all animals were treated
by intramuscular injection.<p>
<li><b>             5.  Dosage Used</b><p>
The recommended dosage for the pioneer product is 1 mL/200 pound body weight.
This same dosage was used for the pioneer product and the generic product.<p>
<li><b>             6.   Test Duration</b><p>
The test period consisted of a 14-day pre-treatment quarantine period to
confirm the health of the test animals.  The first treatment was given and
serum samples were taken up through 54 hours post-treatment.  A fourteen (14)
day washout period was provided between the first treatment and the
administration of the second treatment of this cross-over.  After the second
treatment, serum samples were taken up through 54 hours post-treatment.<p>
<li><b>             7.   Pertinent Parameters</b><p>
The parameter measured in this bioequivalency study was the serum level of
selenium following intramuscular administration of the pioneer product and the
generic product.</ul><p>
<b>     C.  <b>Statistical Analysis</b>:</b><p>
CMAX and AUC values were analyzed for deviations from normality.  Based upon
the combined results obtained with normal probability plots, the Shapiro-Wilk's
test (p&gt; 0.1) and a Box-Cox analysis (p&gt;0.1 using chi square
distribution), it was determined that the untransformed data were normally
distributed.  Consequently, all data analysis was conducted on the original
(linear) scale.  These data were subsequently evaluated (without baseline
correction) for treatment effects using a traditional analysis of variance

<b>     D.   Conclusion:</b><p>
A single IM dose (1 mL per 200 lbs.), 2 period cross-over study was conducted
in 20 calves to compare the bioavailability of a pioneer product (i.e.,
reference drug) Mu-Se&#174; with a Fort Dodge Laboratories test Vitamin
E/Selenium formulation.  The bioequivalence of these two Vitamin E/Selenium
formulations was assessed by serum analysis for selenium levels.  It can be
concluded from the data collected that the two products are bioequivalent.<p>
<b> III. HUMAN SAFETY</b><p>
<b>Withdrawal Time</b><p>
To be used only as directed in weanling calves and breeding beef cows.
Discontinue use 30 days before the treated  cattle are slaughtered for human
consumption.  This withdrawal period is the same as the pioneer's.<p>
<b> VI. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>
  
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirement of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that Velenium(TM) (SELENIUM, VITAMIN E) when used under the

 Data from Studies C-109, C-205, C-207, C-225 and C-226 were considered
acceptable in support of the effectiveness of lasalocid in combination with OTC
for improving feed efficiency and increasing rate of weight gain in cattle fed
in confinement for slaughter (Study C-83-27 was not used in the pooled analysis
because the cattle had been previously treated with hormonal implants).  A
total of 648 cattle were involved at five different experimental locations.
The locations and management practices employed are representative of major
cattle feeding areas and practices in the United States with exception that
none of the test cattle received growth promoting implants.<p>
The data from the five studies was subjected to a pooled analysis of variance
comparing the combination of OTC &#43; Lasalocid to OTC alone and to negative
controls for both ADG and Feed/Gain.  The means and their standard error are
presented as follows:<p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 3 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>
             Control              OTC           Las &#43; OTC</b>

ADG (lb)    2.771 &#43;/- 0.031     2.798 &#43;/- 0.031     2.861 &#43;/- 0.031
Feed/Gain   7.707 &#43;/- 0.079     7.529 &#43;/- 0.079     7.315 &#43;/- 0.079


</pre>
 
ADG and Feed/Gain were improved by the addition of both lasalocid and OTC to
the diet.  ADG for the lasalocid and OTC group was shown to be significantly
better than the control group (P&#61;0.0023) and tended to be better than the OTC
group (P&#61;0.0777).  Feed/Gain for the combination was shown to be significantly
greater than the control group (P&lt;0.0005) and OTC group (P&lt;0.0313).  No
differences were seen between groups with respect to carcass quality.<p>
Data from Studies C-109, C-225, C-226 and C-83-27 were considered acceptable in
support of the effectiveness of lasalocid in combination with OTC for reducing
the incidence and severity of liver abscesses in cattle fed in confinement to
slaughter. Studies C-205 and C-207 were not used because the incidence of liver
abscesses in these trials was too low to draw adequate conclusions.<p>
The data for these studies were subjected to a pooled analysis of variance to
determine if lasalocid interfered with the ability of OTC to control liver
abscesses.  The means of percentages of animals with liver abscesses were
37.51, 24.88, and 24.45 for the control, OTC treated, and Lasalocid &#43; OTC
treated groups, respectively.  The percentages of incidence of liver abscesses
for the lasalocid &#43; OTC and OTC groups were significantly less than for the
control group (P&lt;0.05).  No significant difference was seen between the
lasalocid &#43; OTC and OTC groups with respect to the percentage of incidence of
liver abscesses (sensitivity to detect a change of 15&#37; incidence with 80&#37; power
for a one sided test at the 0.05 level of significance).<p>
Based on the above studies, it is concluded that OTC fed in combination with
lasalocid is more effective than OTC fed alone to feedlot cattle with respect
to improving feed efficiency. Furthermore, it is concluded that lasalocid does
not interfere with the ability of OTC to reduce the incidence and severity of
liver abscesses.<p>

With respect to the Center's Combination Drug Guidelines (November 9, 1983), it
must be demonstrated that:<ul><p>
<li>a)  Lasalocid &#43; OTC is better than OTC for performance; and <LI>b)  lasalocid &#43; OTC is
better than lasalocid for reduced liver abscesses.</ul><p>
The studies cited above provide a direct comparison between the combination and
OTC alone.  Lasalocid &#43; OTC was shown to be better than OTC alone for improving
feed efficiency.  No direct comparison can be made between the combination and
lasalocid alone.  However, the data demonstrate that both OTC alone and in
combination with lasalocid was effective in reducing the incidence of liver
abscesses and that lasalocid does not interfere with the ability of OTC in this
respect.  Furthermore, studies used for the approval of lasalocid in feedlot
cattle (see Table below) showed no effect of lasalocid on incidence of liver
abscesses. Accordingly, it is concluded that lasalocid &#43; OTC has been
demonstrated to be better than lasalocid for reducing liver abscesses.<p>

<b> 5. Animal Safety:</b><p>
Safety studies for lasalocid in feedlot cattle at dosages up to 5X the
recommended level are reported in NADA 96-298.  OTC is currently approved for
cattle at 0.5 to 2.0 grams per head daily for the prevention and treatment of
the early stages of shipping fever complex.  This dose is 6.7X to 26.7X the
dose presently requested.<p>
Two hundred cattle from the studies used in the pooled analysis for efficacy
were fed lasalocid and OTC during the entire finishing period at the highest
level in the approved ranges and no adverse effects were noted during the
entire feeding period.<p>
It is concluded that the combination of lasalocid and OTC is safe in feedlot
cattle.<p>
 
<b> 6. Human Safety:</b><p>
<b>A. Toxicity Tests and Safe Concentration of Residues</b><p>
Toxicity metabolism and total residue depletion studies, which are used to
establish human safety for lasalocid and oxytetracycline, are described in the
FOI Summary for NADA 96-298 (approved at 47 FR 34133/4, August 6, 1982) for
lasalocid and NADA 8-804 for oxytetracycline as individual entities.<p>
The tolerances of oxytetracycline are established at 0.1 ppm in the uncooked
edible tissues of cattle, beef calves, non lactating dairy cattle and dairy
calves (21 CFR 556.600) with liver and kidney as the target tissues for feed
uses.<p>
The safe concentrations of total lasalocid residues in the livers of cattle
have been established at 4.8 ppm.  A marker residue concentration of 0.7 ppm of
intact lasalocid corresponds to a total residue level of 4.8 ppm (21 CFR
556.347).<p>
<b>B. Residue Depletion/Noninterference Studies</b><p>
A tissue depletion study in cattle fed lasalocid at 300 mg/head/day using feed
with 30 g lasalocid/ton feed and oxytetracycline at 75 mg/hd/day for 34 days
was undertaken by Animal Science Research, Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc., Nutley, NJ.
The study was conducted at the ASR Experiment Station (ASRES), Wrightstown, NJ
using ten cattle of mixed breeds and sexes weighing 628 to 857 lbs.  The
animals were allocated as shown in the following table with the 34 day
medication period from 1/13 - 2/16/87.<p>

The animals were slaughtered on the morning of 2/17/87 at ASRES, and a 3 kg
liver sample and both kidneys from each animal were collected, identified and
frozen as soon as possible.  The samples were transported to the HLR Animal
Science Research (ASR) Analytical/Metabolic Labs, Nutley, NJ where the liver
samples were split in half.  Both kidneys and one half liver sample from each
animal were shipped frozen via overnight express on 2/18/87 to Hazleton Labs,
America Inc., Madison, WI for oxytetracycline assay.  The other one half liver
sample was forwarded to the ASR analytical lab for lasalocid assay.<p>
The hplc-fluorescence detection regulatory procedure for the determination of
sodium lasalocid in bovine liver with a sensitivity of 0.025 ppm was used by
Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc. for all bovine liver assays in this study.  The 
hplc-fluorescence detection tissue residue procedure for lasalocid is described in
the Food Additives Manual which is on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857).<p>
The oxytetracycline tissue residue assays were conducted by Hazleton Labs,
America Inc., Madison, WI using a method from "Antibiotic Residues in Milk,
Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports and Protocols," revised
October 1968, National Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, Food &amp;
Drug Administration, Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, Washington, DC
modified for a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm oxytetracycline in liver and kidney.<p>

The results of the two residue studies show that the residues do not exceed the
established safe concentration for lasalocid and the tolerance for OTC at zero
day withdrawal, the assigned withdrawal period of lasalocid and oxytetracycline
in cattle.<p>
<b>C. Assay Noninterference Studies</b><p>
The hplc-fluorescence procedure was evaluated with all the common antibiotics
including oxytetracycline prior to initial submission to NADA 96-298 on October
17, 1980, and it was determined that no antibiotic including oxytetracycline
was detected in the method or interfered with the lasalocid determination.<p>
The method was validated to a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm and shown to have no
interference with lasalocid using a simultaneous 0.7 ppm lasalocid spike in the
same tissue sample.  This study also included a 14 day stability test of
oxytetracycline in frozen tissue which showed no losses over that time
period.<p>
<b>D. Analytical Methods for Determination of Residues</b><p>
The hplc-fluorescence detection tissue residue regulatory procedure for the
determination of sodium lasalocid in bovine liver with a sensitivity of 0.025
ppm is described in the Food Additives Manual which is on display in FDA's
Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20857).<p>
The oxytetracycline tissue residue assays used a method from "Antibiotic
Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports and

Washington, DC modified for a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm oxytetracycline in liver
and kidney.<p>
<b>E. 21 CFR 558.15</b><p>
The following studies were conducted to satisfy the animal and human health
safety requirements of 21 CFR Section 558.15 for use of OTC at 75 to 80
mg/head/day in cattle (NADA 8-804).<p>
<b>Title:  </b>Effect of Oxytetracycline of Tissue Levels, Antimicrobial Resistance and
Shedding of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>&#160; from Cattle.<p>
<b>Report No.: </b> C 110184<p>
<b>Starting Date: </b>April 18, 1985<p>
<b>Termination Date: </b>July 18, 1985<p>
<b>Investigator: </b>Colorado Animal Research Enterprises, Inc.<p>
<b>Location: </b>Ft. Collins, Colorado<p>
<b>Substance Tested: </b>Oxytetracycline administered in feed<p>
<b>Animals:</b> Crossbred heifer and steer calves, seven per treatment
group.<p>
This study was conducted to assess the effect of oxytetracycline fed to cattle
at 75 mg/hd/day on the quantity, prevalence and duration of shedding of a
tetracycline resistant <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>&#160; and to evaluate the effect of
resistance characteristics and tissue levels of the infecting organism.<p>
Calves, weighing 500 to 600 lb, were orally inoculated with a tetracycline
resistant <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>&#160; after a four week adjustment period in the
test facilities.  Medicated diet feeding was initiated to the appropriate
treatment group at six days after the challenge and was continued daily for the
next eight weeks. Post challenge fecal samples were collected twice prior to
treatment initiation and 22 times during the 56 day treatment period.
Collected specimens were direct-counted for quantities of test salmonellae and
enriched for detection of non-countable levels of test salmonellae.  From ten
of the post challenge sampling periods, five <i>S. typhimurium</i>&#160; isolates per calf
tested by a microdilution, MIC method for susceptibility to amikacin,
kanamycin, carbenicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.  At study end, samples of liver, spleen and
mesenteric lymph node were surgically removed from all Salmonella-challenged
calves and were analyzed for presence of test salmonellae.  This study was
conducted in compliance with US FDA Good Laboratory Practice Regulations (21
CFR 58).<p>
Oxytetracycline administered to cattle in their feed at 75 mg/hd/day did not
significantly increase the quantity, duration of prevalence of Salmonella
shedding, nor increase the incidence of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella,
nor increase the presence of Salmonella in tissue.<p>

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of oxytetracycline fed to cattle
at 75 mg/hd/day on the incidence of antimicrobial resistant indigenous fecal
coliforms.<p>
Fecal samples from medicated and non-medicated cattle were collected prior to
treatment initiation to obtain baseline data, and weekly thereafter over an
eight week treatment period.  Ten coliform isolates per calf per sampling were
tested by a microdilution, MIC method for susceptibility to amikacin,
ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin,
nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfadiazine, tetracycline and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.  This study was conducted in compliance with US
FDA Good Laboratory Practice Regulations (21 CFR 58).<p>
The administration of oxytetracycline in feed to cattle at 75 mg/hd/day did not
significantly increase the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in their
indigenous fecal coliforms.<p>
<b> 7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
For the purpose of the human food safety review, this original NADA has been
treated as a Category II supplement under the Agency's Supplemental Policy (42
FR 64367; December 23, 1977). This NADA provides for the combination use of
lasalocid and OTC at the levels of 10 to 30 mg/ton of feed and 75 mg/hd/day,
respectively, for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, and
reduction of incidence and severity of liver abscesses in beef cattle fed in
confinement for slaughter. Adequate data were submitted which show that the
combination resulted in a significant (P&lt;.05) improvement in feed efficiency
when compared to OTC fed alone and that lasalocid does not interfere with the
ability of OTC in reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses.
Adequate animal safety data was provided to show that the combination is safe
for the target animals to consume.  Adequate data was presented to show that
OTC at a level of 75 to 80 mg/hd/day has met the human and animal safety
requirements of 21 CFR 558.15.  (Higher levels of OTC for use in cattle feed
have not met the requirements for 21 CFR 558.15.  Adequate data is also
available to show that lasalocid for use in cattle feed to 30 g/ton of total
ration has met the requirements for 21 CFR 558.15  (NADA 96-298).  No changes
were made in the approved levels of either compound or in the target animal and
the noninterference of lasalocid and OTC with the analytical methods for OTC
and lasalocid, respectively, was demonstrated.  According, approval of this
change is not expected to increase human exposure to drug residues, and
therefore did not require a complete re-evaluation of the human safety data in
the original applications.  These production drugs are "OTC" because the use of
them does not raise any special safety concerns or require any diagnosis. <p>

<B>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</B><P>

<B>I. General Information:</B><P>

<B>NADA Number:</B> 140-857<P>

<B>Sponsor:</B><P>

Norden Laboratories, Inc.<br>
Lincoln, NE 68501<P>

<B>Generic Name:</B> Luprostiol<P>

<B>Tradename:</B> Equestrolin(TM)<P>

<B>Marketing Status:</B> Prescription Rx<P>

<B>Date of Summary:</B> January 5, 1990<P>

<B>II. Indications for Use:</B><P>

Luprostiol is indicated for 1) estrus control and 2) termination of pregnancy
in mares under the following conditions:<P>

<B>Estrus Control:</B><P>

Luprostiol is effective as a luteolysin and may be used to
regress a functional, progesterone producing corpus luteum, subsequently
inducing estrus, ovulation and normal conception in breeding mares under the
following conditions:<P>

<B>(1). Estrus Control in Normal Cycling and Transitional Phase Mares:</B> <P>

(a) Normal cycling mares that demonstrate estrus activity may be treated to
shorten the estrous cycle. Treatment should be given during the diestrus
period when functional corpora lutea are present.<P>

(b) Mares displaying estrous cycles, albeit erratic, may be treated if mature
corpora lutea are present to shorten and/or reinitiate the estrous cycle.<P>

<B>(2). Estrus Control in Postpartum Mares:</B><P>

(a) Postpartum mares that exhibit an overt foal heat but are not bred at this
heat, in order to avoid reduced fertility, may be treated six to 12 days after
the foal heat ovulation to attempt an early return to estrus ("second" foal
heat) and subsequent breeding opportunity.<P>

(b) Lactating mares that do not exhibit a foal heat and that are considered to
be in lactational anestrus may be treated approximately 21 days postpartum in
order to initiate estrus cyclicity.<P>

<B>3. Estrus Control in Mares With Persistent Corpora Lutea:</B><P>

Mares not cycling due to a persistent corpus luteum (CL) may be treated to
terminate functional luteal tissue. This would include:<P>

(a) mares considered pseudopregnant (i.e., bred and determined not to be
pregnant but displaying signs of pregnancy as a result of persistent CL
activity).<P>

(b) mares in clinical anestrus (i.e., not cycling during the breeding season due
to persistent CL activity).<P>

(c) mares that have lost a conceptus during early gestation and that have not
recycled due to persistent CL activity.<P>

(d) maiden and barren mares in extended periods of diestrus due to persistent CL
activity.<P>

<B>4. Termination of Pregnancy</B> <P>

The luteolytic activity of luprostiol is also effective for the induction of
abortion in mares pregnant for 36 days or less.<P>

<B>III. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</B><P>

<B>Dosage Form: </B><P>

Luprostiol is a clear, colorless, sterile solution containing 7.5 mg of
luprostiol per mL of propylene glycol.<P>

<B>Route of Administration: </B><P>

Equestrolin is to be administered by intramuscular injection.<P>

<B>Recommeded Dosage:</B><P>

The dose is 7.5 mg (1 mL) per mare for the induction of fertile estrus
or for abortion.<P>

<B>IV. Effectiveness:</B><P>

<B>A. Estrus Control Claim</B><P>

A dose determination study, two well controlled studies and 14 clinical field
trials were conducted to determine the effectiveness of luprostiol for the
induction of a fertile estrus in lighthorse mares. A list of investigators is
provided in Table 1. Mares were administered an intramuscular injection of a
prostaglandin control or luprostiol at the recommended use levels. In all
studies, luteolysis was determined from the visual behavioral signs of estrus
displayed by the mares post injection. In addition, serum progesterone
concentrations were used in the dose determination and well controlled studies
to confirm the luteolytic effect of the prostaglandin. The luteolytic property
of the prostaglandins for estrus control was evaluated in 1) normal cycling and
transitional phase mares, 2) postpartum mares, and 3) mares with persistent
corpora lutea. For each study, posttreatment estrus, ovulation and conception
rates were determined for the mares. Mares that subsequently displayed
behavioral signs of estrus within six days post injection (PI) were categorized
as animals that responded to treatment. The response rates calculated from the
number of injections were 77.8&#37; for the prostaglandin treated controls and
82.4&#37; for the luprostiol-treated mares. The first-service conception of mares
administered luprostiol was significantly improved in healthy, well-managed
mares, especially for those mares considered difficult to breed (e.g., mares in
the transitional phase, and mares anestrus during lactation or due to
persistent luteal activity). The first-service conception rates for mares that
responded to prostaglandin treatment were 56.2&#37; for the controls as compared to
68.4&#37; for luprostiol.<P>

<B>1. Pivotal Studies</B><P>

<B>Dose Determination Study</B><P>

E.L. Squires, PhD<br>
Colorado State University<br>
Equine Sciences<br>
Fort Collins, CO<P>

A dose determination study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of
luprostiol for inducing a fertile estrus in mares within 6 days postinjection.
Healthy mares were allocated into 6 groups (20/group) and administered
luprostiol at 0.00, 1.88, 3.75, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/head, or a prostaglandin
control at the recommended dose. Following treatment, hormone profiles,
indications of induced estrus, and subsequent ovulation and conception were
monitored. Appropriate parametric (unpaired t-test) and non parametric (Mann
Whitney) tests were used to compare the serum progesterone, LH and FSH
concentrations between treatment groups (1). The Fisher's Exact test (1,2) was
used to compare differences of nominal independent data between treatment
groups regarding estrus induction, ovulation, first-service conception and
embryo recovery. The Cochran-Armitage Linear trend test (3) was used to
determine a linear trend between the treatment groups and fertile estrus (based
on the total number of mares in each group). These tests were used in
conjunction with biological advantage to determine the optimal dose.<P>

The luprostiol dose which was effective in inducing estrus and achieving
optimal first service conception following induced estrus (fertile estrus) was
determined to be 7.5 mg/head. Although significant differences were not found
among any of the potentially active luprostiol dosage groups (i.e., 1.88, 3.75,
7.5 and 15 mg.head) with respect to progesterone values, induced estrus rates,
fertile estrus rates or subsequent ovulation, the 7.5 mg/head dose resulted in
the highest fertile estrus rate suggesting a biological advantage over the
other doses. On the basis of achieving an optimal rate of fertile estrus, as
indicated by a first service conception rate of 72&#37;, the dosage of 7.5 mg/head
is the effective optimal dose of luprostiol for the mare for estrus control.
In subsequent clinical field studies, luprostiol administered at 7.5 mg/head
was equivalent to prostaglandin controls for estrus control.<P>

<B>Well-Controlled Studies</B><P>

Two well-controlled studies were conducted at different geographical locations.
Lighthorse mares (92) were administered an intramuscular injection of a
positive control or luprostiol at the recommended use levels. Observed
clinical signs of estrus and serum progesterone concentrations were used to
confirm the effectiveness of the prostaglandins. The luteolytic properties of
the prostaglandins for estrus control were evaluated in (1) normal cycling
mares, (2) postpartum mares, and (3) mares with persistent corpora lutea. The
individual investigator's efficacy results for these three indications are
summarized in Table 2.<P>

Serum progesterone concentrations were determined to confirm the luteolytic
effectiveness of the two prostaglandin. Serum samples were collected from the
mares prior to treatment (0 hour) and at 48 and 96 hours post injection, and
mean progesterone values are summarized in Table 3.<P>

<B>Clinical Field Trials</B><P>

Fourteen (14) field trials in different geographical locations were used to conduct
the efficacy and safety evaluations of luprostiol in mares for estrus control.
The results are listed in Table 2.<P>

<B>Summary of Effectiveness and Statistical Results</B><P>

The overall effectiveness of luprostiol is displayed in the following table
using two different observational units: (1) number of injections; and (2)
number of mares. Some mares were administered more than one injection during
the breeding season, as is normal practice. Only the initial injection and
subsequent efficacy results were used for this summary of the data and thus,
the number of mares was also considered the observational unit. The first
service conception rates of the 2 treatment groups were statistically
analyzed using the Fisher's Exact test.<P>

<B>2. Corroborative Studies</B><P>

<B>Summary</B><P>

Four investigations were conducted in Europe to evaluate the clinical
effectiveness of luprostiol for use in mares. Dose response studies indicated
that the optimal effective dosage of luprostiol for estrus control in the mare
was 7.5 mg/head administered intramuscularly. European field use and drug
tolerance studies demonstrated that luprostiol was highly efficacious and will
tolerated for inducing fertile estrus. Studies to determine the effectiveness
of luprostiol for estrus control indicated that a total of 137 mares given
luprostiol at 7.5 mg./head, 110 (80&#37;) came into estrus and of these 72 were
successfully bred. Thus, a pregnancy rate of 65.5&#37; was achieved in the mares
which came into estrus following luprostiol treatment.<P>

One clinical study conducted in the United States is also included in this
section. Treatments were administered during mid to late September, a time of
year when mares enter into season anestrus. Thus, low efficacy results were
not unexpected. The results of this study to evaluate luprostiol for estrus
control also included the determination of serum progesterone concentrations
for mares of three separate experiments.<P>

A pilot study to determine estrus induction in 28 mares was conducted in 27
Warmbloed Paardenstamboek Nederland (W.P.N.) breed mares and one heavy draught
Belgian mare using luprostiol at 5.625 mg/head. The mare's body weights ranged
from 450 to 750 kg. Nineteen mares were initially treated with 5.625 mg
luprostiol. No rectal examination before treatment was performed, nor plasma
progesterone values determined. Therefore, the study was not designed to show
100&#37; estrus induction because this compound can only be effective in the
presence of a functional corpus luteum. Of these 19 mares, 14 came into heat
(showing clinical signs of estrus) within 4 days post injection, 13 were
serviced and 7 became pregnant. The remaining 5 mares were treated with
another dose of 5.625 mg luprostiol 7 days later, 1 mare came into heat
and was serviced but did not conceive. Three (3) of the 4 remaining mares were
dosed for a third time. All 3 mares exhibited signs of heat by the fourth
day post injection, all were serviced, and 1 mare became pregnant.<P>

A second group of 9 mares which had been serviced and were negative with the
rectal pregnancy test were treated. After they were administered luprostiol,
all mares exhibited estrus. Six (6) of the mares were serviced and 5
conceived.<P>

No side effects were observed in the treated horses from either group.<P>

A dose titration study involving 30 cases of luprostiol treated mares of W.P.N.
and Arabian breeds, ranging from two to 11 years and body weights of 532 to 725
kg., were administered intramuscularly 1 ml of one of the following
concentrations: 0.47 mg/ml, 0.94 mg/ml, 1.88 mg/ml, 3.75 mg/ml or 7.5 mg/ml.
An additional untreated control
group was also used with plasma progesterone levels determined for all
treatment groups on day 0, day 1, day 3, day 8-10, and day 14.
Results indicated that the optimal effective dosage of luprostiol for estrus
control in the mare is 7.5 mg/head administered intramuscularly.<P>

Dr. A. Wilderbeek<br>
Boxmeer<br>
The Netherlands<P>

The first clinical trial involving 31 mares at one farm of mostly New-Forest
ponies and Arabian breeds, were administered 1 ml (7.5 mg) luprostiol
intramuscularly which resulted in 67&#37; of the mares having estrus induced within
seven days, of which 20 were serviced and 18 became pregnant. The second
clinical trial involved 4 Haflingers (dosed with 3.75 mg/head), one riding
horse and one heavy draught horse each dosed with 1 ml(7.5 mg/head) luprostiol
intramuscularly. The results showed 100&#37; estrus induction and 100&#37; conception.
Sweating was observed in one mare of the 37 luprostiol-treated mares.<P>

Drs. A. Wilderbeek<br>

A clinical trial was conducted using luprostiol in field use conditions located
on stud farms and private residences. Forty (40) horses were treated for one of the
following indications: 1) suboestrus, 2) second foal heat (the induction of
estrus 20 days after parturition), 3) induction of estrus after embryonic
death, and 4) partus induction. Mares of various breeds (W.P.N. breed, Hackney,
Standardbred, Arabian and English thoroughbred), ages (4 to 23 years) and
weights (400 to 750 kg) were administered 7.5 mg luprostiol to treat these
disorders. Excluding the indication of partus induction, a total of 37 horses
were treated, 35 came into heat, 31 were serviced, and 19 became pregnant
within the first two cycles after luprostiol treatment. None of the mares
treated showed any side effects.<P>

Twelve pony mares, pregnant for 106 to 152 days, were given luprostiol for the
termination of pregnancy in a clinical trial. Eleven of the 12 (92&#37;) aborted
after an average of 3 injections. No evidence of side effects, retained
placenta nor endometritis were observed after abortion on the 11 mares. Three
months post abortion the mares were observed for estrus and bred, and within
8 months post abortion 10 of the 11 mares (91&#37;) were again pregnant. The
12th mare did not abort after 5 injections and subsequently gave birth to a
healthy foal. This mare did show signs of sweating and increased respiration
after receiving multiple injections.<P>

A toxicity/safety study was conducted to determine the effect of luprostiol
when administered to mares at 1X, 3X and 5x the proposed use level (7.5 mg per
mare). Additionally, a group of control mares were each administered a 5 ml
placebo containing propylene glycol (i.e., equivalent to the volume of vehicle
given to mares that received luprostiol at 5x). The test articles were
administered by intramuscular injection once daily for three consecutive days.
Appropriate parametric (unpaired t-test) and nonparametric (Mann-Whitney)
tests were used to compare the serum progesterone, clinical chemistry,
hematology, body weights and feed consumption data(1).  The Fisher's Exact test
(1,2) was used to compare differences of nominal independent data between
treatment groups. In summary, the administration of luprostiol at 1x, 3x, or
5x the recommended level produced little overt effect.<P>

No dose-response trend was apparent with respect to changes in body temperature
following any of the 1x, 3x or 5x injections. A decrease in the percentage of
eosinophils was observed after each injection, irregardless of the luprostiol
treatment group observed. However, the eosinophil counts returned to baseline
within 24 hours postinjection. No dose response relationships were detected for
the remaining hematological or clinical chemistry parameters. Ovarian
follicular fluid increased as the dose of luprostiol was increased. However,
this is not considered pathologically significant since one of the effects of
luprostiol is accelerated ovulation. Therefore, the increase in follicular
fluid was judged to represent a more mature preovulatory follicle in the mares
receiving increased dosages of luprostiol. Hyperglycemia, dyspnea, hypergastric
motility and hyperthermia were not observed in mares given luprostiol up to 5X
the recommended dose for three consecutive days. Gross and macroscopic
evaluation of tissues from mares administered luprostiol at 1x, 3x, or 5x the
recommended level revealed no drug related lesions at the conclusion of the
study.<P>

<B>Foal Safety Studies</B><P>

M.L. Sharp, DVM<br>
Box 353<br>
Vernon, TX<P>

Two separate trials were conducted to evaluate the clinical safety of
luprostiol in 28 healthy foals. Either 7.5 mg/head or 15 mg/head of luprostiol
was administered by intramuscular injection to each postpartum mare with a
nursing foal.<P>

Sixteen (16) healthy foals were observed in the first trial. Four (4) postpartum mares
with nursing foals were each administered a 1 ml intramuscular injection of a
placebo (i.e., propylene glycol). Eight postpartum mares with nursing foals
were each administered a 1 ml intramuscular injection of luprostiol (7.5
mg/head).<P>

Each foal was continuously observed 24 hours prior to treatment of its dam and
through 24 hours post-treatment. The following parameters were measured:
(1)rectal temperature,  (2) heart rate; (3) respiratory rate; (4) intestinal
sounds; (5) frequency of defecation; (6) stool consistency; (7) frequency of
micturition; (8) frequency of nursing; (9) frequency of lying down and
duration.<P>

The observed parameters were considered normal for all 16 foals during the 48
hour observation period. No adverse reactions were reported for any of the
foals and no effect on their overall functions or behavior was noted.
Therefore, nursing foals were not affected when their dams were intramuscularly
administered 1 ml (7.5 mg) of luprostiol.<P>

In the second trial, 12 healthy foals were observed. Four postpartum mares
with nursing foals were each administered a 2 ml intramuscular placebo (i.e.,
propylene glycol). Eight postpartum mares with nursing foals were each
administered 2 ml (2x the recommended use level) luprostiol intramuscularly at
a concentration of 7.5 mg/ml.<P>

Each foal was continuously observed 24 hours prior to treatment of its dam and
through 24 hours post treatment. Daily observations of each foal were
continued for 30 days post treatment of its dam. The same parameters,
previously mentioned, were measured for each foal beginning 24 hours prior to
treatment of its dam and continuing for 96 hours post treatment of its dam.<P>

In addition, clinical tests that included hematology, blood and serum
chemistries were performed on blood drawn from each foal at 24 hours prior to
treatment of its dam and then at 0 hour and 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and
96 hours post treatment of its dam. Also, a urinalysis and fecal examination
for each foal was conducted at 24 hours prior to treatment of its dam and then
at 0 hour and 24, 48 and 96 hours post treatment of its dam.<P>

The observed parameters were considered normal for all 12 foals during the 30
day post treatment observation period. No adverse reactions were reported for
any of the foals and no effect on their overall functions or behavior was
noted. No systemic signs of toxicity or adverse effects were noted in the
blood, urine or fecal analyses.<P>

In summary, nursing foals were not affected when their dams were treated with
either 1x or 2x the recommended dose (7.5 mg/head) of luprostiol.<P>


<B>Clinical Safety - Summary</B><P>

Information regarding the safety of luprostiol administered at the recommended
use level of 7.5 mg for estrus control or abortion was collected during the
clinical efficacy field program. No drug interactions were reported between
luprostiol and the standard therapy in the management or treatment of mares.
Standard animal health products included antibiotics, anthelmintics and
therapies to induce ovulation (e.g., GnRH, HCG). Post treatment conception
rates, particularly first service conception, were highly successful in the
luprostiol treated mares. Therefore, it was demonstrated that luprostiol had
no adverse affect on conception and that the reproductive competence of these
mares was not only maintained, buy may have been improved.<P>

<B>B. Corroborative Studies</B><P>

<B>Mutagenicity Studies</B><P>

The mutagenicity of luprostiol was evaluated in the following tests:<P>

1. Salmonella/mammalian: Microsome Mutagenicity Test (Ames Test), H.P.F.
Joosten, Scientific Development Group, Organon, Oss, The Netherlands<P>

2. Micronucleus Test in Rats, H.P.F. Joosten, Scientific Development Group,

A negative response was produced in each study and it was concluded that
luprostiol was not a potential mutagen.<P>

<B>Oral Toxicity Study in Rats</B><P>

Crosby Thompkins<br>
Toxicity Research Labs<br>
Muskegon, MI<P>

Four groups of Crl:CD&#174; (SD) BR rats (20/sex/group) were dosed orally by
gavage once daily with 0.00, 0.10, 3.00, or 100.00 mg/kg/day of luprostiol
until the day of necropsy. Body weights and food consumption were recorded.
Administration of 100 mg/kg/day of luprostiol to rats for 13 weeks produced
retained corpora lutea, hematopoiesis of the spleen and liver, nephrosis and
interstitial nephritis, degeneration of the harderian gland, excessive
formation of bone trabeculae and osteoid tissue in the femur, excessive
formation of osteoid tissue and/or callus in the tibia/fibula, and fractures of
the tibia/fibula. (Formation of callus in the tibia/fibula is considered to be
an attempt by the body to heal the fractures). Administration of 3.00
mg/kg/day of luprostiol produced some retention of corpora lutea but no other
treatment related effects. Administration of 0.10 mg/kg/day of luprostiol
produced no treatment-related effects.<P>

<B>Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs</B><P>

Crosby Thompkins<br>
Toxicity Research Labs<br>
Muskegon, MI<P>

Four groups of beagle dogs (6/sex/group) were dosed once daily with 0.0, 0.025,
0.250 and 2.500 mg/kg of luprostiol until their day of necropsy during week 14.
Administration of luprostiol at the 2.500 mg/kg/day dose level produced
multifocal serositis in the liver, associated with changes in some
clinicopathologic parameters. Other effects were transitory lower body weight
gain and food consumption averages, and several clinical signs which decreased
in frequency as the study progressed. The only effects seen at the 0.250
mg/kg/day dose level were a higher mean adrenal weight in treated males than in
the control group and observed vasculitis, mainly of the central vein of the
liver, in 50&#37; of the males and 17&#37; of the females. No effects of toxicological
significance were seen at the 0.025 mg/kg/day dose level.<P>


<B>Teratogenicity Study in Rats</B><P>

Mildred Christian<br>
Argus Research Labs, Inc.<br>
Perkasie, PA<P>

Luprostiol was administered orally via gavage to presumed pregnant rats on day
six through 15 of gestation at dosages of 0 (vehicle), 0.12, 1.20, 12.00 or
2500.00 &#181;g/kg/day. The dosage volume administered (5 ml/kg) was adjusted daily
for observed body weights. The dams were sacrificed, and the fetuses were
Caesarean-delivered on day 20 of presumed gestation.<P>

Embryo/fetal effects occurred only at the abortifacient 2500.00 &#181;g/kg/day
dosage. Most of these effects could not be distinguished from the maternal
effects of the test article and included increased resorption, fetal death and
decreased litter size. The adult and developmental NOEL were determined to be
12.00 &#181;g/kg/day.<P>

<B>Multigeneration Study in Rats</B><P>

Mildred Christian<br>
Argus Research Labs, Inc.<br>
Perkasie, PA<P>

Luprostiol was administered via gavage once daily to F0 Generation
Crl:COBS&#174; (SD)BR male and female rats at dosages of 0 (vehicle), 0.10,
1.00, 10.00 or 2500.00 &#181;g/kg/day. Dosages were administered to the second
parental generation rats (F1b Generation).<P>

The 2500.00 &#181;g/kg/day dosage was toxic to the first parental generation of
rats. Toxic effects of this dosage of luprostiol included death, clinical
signs, gross lesions and inhibited body weight gain. This toxic dosage also
resulted in adverse effects on reproduction including decreased fertility,
abortion and decreased viability of offspring. As compared with control
values, no adverse, dosage dependent toxic or adverse reproductive effects were
observed for the 0.10, 1.00, or 10.00 &#181;g/kg/day dosage group first (F0) or
second (F1b) generation adults or their offspring (F1a, F1b, F2a and F2b
litters). Thus, the NOEL was determined to be 10 &#181;g/kg/day.<P>

<B>VI. Human Safety:</B><P>

Data on the safety of human consumption of drug residues in food were not
required for this NADA. Luprostiol is intended for use only in horses, and is
not intended for human consumption and is labeled: NOT FOR USE IN HORSES
INTENDED FOR FOOD.<P>

Human safety relative to handling and administration of this product is
provided in the labelling, as follows:  Women of childbearing age, asthmatics,
and persons with bronchial and other respiratory problems should exercise
extreme caution when handling this product. In the early stages, women may be
unaware of their pregnancies. Luprostiol is readily absorbed through the skin
and can cause abortion and/or bronchiospasms. Direct contact with the skin
should therefore be avoided. Accidental spillage on the skin should be washed
off immediately with soap and water.<P>

<B>VII. Agency Conclusions:</B><P>

The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. It
demonstrates Equestrolin (luprostiol) when used under its labeled conditions of
use is safe and effective.<P>

For the safe and effective use of Equestrolin it is necessary to provide a
differential diagnosis of the reproductive status of the ovaries per rectal
palpation which only a trained professional can accomplish. Additionally,
professional expertise is required to determine the duration of pregnancy in
those mares to be aborted since the drug is very efficacious up to 36 days of
pregnancy. Accordingly, we have classified Equestrolin as a prescription item.<p>

</head><body><b>Freedom of Information Summary</b><br><P>



<b>1. General Information:</b> 
<p>
<b>NADA Number:</b> 139-191<P>

<b>Sponsor Name/Address:</b><P> Purina Mills, Inc.<br>
          835 South Eighth Street<br>
          St. Louis, Missouri  63201<P>
<b>Generic Name:</b> Pyrantel Pamoate<P>
<b>Tradename:</b> Dog Wormer Chewable Tablets<P>       
<b>Date of Approval:</b> October 13, 1987<P>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><P>
For removal of ascarids (<i>Toxocara canis; Toxascaris leonina</i>&#160;) and hookworms
(<i>Ancylostoma caninum; Uncinaria stenocephala</i>&#160;) in dogs and puppies.<P>
To prevent reinfection of <i>Toxocara canis</i>&#160; in puppies and adult dogs and in
lactating bitches after whelping.<P>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration, and Recommended
Dosage:</b><P>

<b>Dosage Form:</b><p>  Purina Dog Wormer Chewable Tablets are formulated in two
sizes of chewable oral tablets at concentrations of 22.7 mg and 113.5 mg
pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate per tablet.<P>

<b>Route of Administration:</b><p>   Pyrantel pamoate chewable tablets are
administered orally by offering by hand or in the dogs food container with or
without food.<P>

<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>   22.7 mg pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate chewable
tablet - 1 tablet per each 10 lbs. of dog body weight for dogs weighing over 5
lbs. and 1 tablet for dogs weighing less than 5 lbs.<P>

113.5 mg pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate chewable tablet - 1 tablet per
50 lbs. of dog body weight.  Tablet may be broken in half to provide 1/2
tablet for 25 lbs. of body weight.<P>

Label directions are designed to provide a minimum of 2.27 mg pyrantel base
per pound body weight for dogs weighing more than 5 pounds body weight, and
4.54 mg pyrantel base per pound body weight for dogs weighing 5 lbs. or
less.<P>

Tablets are scored to facilitate breaking of tablet for more accurate
dosage.<P>

Since anthelminitics cannot be relied upon to prevent reinfection or to
remove larvae not present in the intestinal tract at the time of initial
treatment, for maximum control, it is recommended that puppies be treated at 2,
3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of age. Lactating bitches should be treated 2-3 weeks
after whelping. Adult dogs should be routinely treated at monthly intervals to
protect against <i>T. canis</i>&#160; reinfection.  Retreatment of adult dogs may be
necessary at monthly intervals as determined by laboratory fecal examinations
or in animals kept in known contaminated quarters.<P>

<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><P>

The effectiveness of Purina Dog Wormer Tablets has been established by data
contained in approved NADA 101-331 (see attached Freedom of Information
Summaries for Pyrantel Pamoate Tablets for Dogs).  This original application
demonstrated that Purina Dog Wormer continues to be effective when administered
as a chewable tablet.<P>
<b>A. Bioequivalence</b><P>

Physical and chemical data demonstrated bioavailability and theraputic
equivalency of the approved regular tablet (NADA 101-331) and the chewable
tablet (NADA 139-191).  The dose and amount of active ingredient (Pyrantel
Pamoate) in the regular tablet and in the chewable tablet are identical.
Pyrantel Pamoate administered orally is not readily absorbed into the systemic
circulation.  The primary site of action as an anthelmintic is in the gastrointestinal tract.  The disintegration time for both the regular tablet and the
chewable tablet is less than 10 minutes. The chewable tablets contain no
excepients that would significantly alter or interfere with the theraputic
activity of pyrantel pamoate in the intestinal tract.  Therefore, theraputic
equivalence of the two tablets has been demonstrated; the efficacy of the
chewable tablets has been established.<P>

<b>B. Palatability</b><P>
<b>I. Home Environmental Test</b><P>

<b>1. Name and address of investigator who did the study.</b><P>
 Mrs. Geralyn Busenski<br>
 Checkerboard Kitchens<br>
 Ralston Purina Company<br>
 St. Louis, Missouri  63164<P>

<b>2. Purpose of Study</b><P>

To demonstrate that Purina Dog Wormer Chewable Tablets are palatable when
hand offered to dogs in non-competitive home 
environments.<P>

<b>3. Test Animals</b><P>

Forty dogs of all sizes, both sexes and many breeds were hand offered the
chewable tablet and allowed a maximum of 15 minutes to fully consume the
tablet.  Dogs are owned and housed in the homes of non-biased participants 
who regularly test dog food and treat products in their homes.  All dogs are
from a single animal environment to exclude competition.<P>

<b>4. Test Product</b><P>

Owners determined weight of their dog and received a  "coded" pouch
containing the premeasured dosage of Dog Wormer Chewable Tablets.  Dosage made
up of small and/or large tablets, whole and/or broken depending upon dog
size.<P>

<b>5. Results</b><P>

Ninety-four percent (94%) consumed the tablet within the 15 minutes
provided.  One dog refused to eat the tablet and one ate only when it was added
to its food.<P>

<b>II. Acceptance Test</b><P>

<b>1. Name and address of investigator who did the study:</b><P>
 Mr. C. W. Dickerson<br>
 Health Industries Research<br>
 Pet Nutrition Department<br>
 Purina Research Farm<br>
 Gray Summit, MO.<P>


<b>2. Purpose of Study</b><P>

To demonstrate acceptablility of Purina Dog Wormer Chewable Tablets
containing pyrantel pamoate to various breeds, sizes and sexes of dogs.<P>

<b>3. Test Animals</b><P>
Dogs were penned individually or with its litter. Dogs were offered both large and/or small tablets in order to obtain more
exact dosage and to determine palatability of both sizes by hand and allowed 15
minutes to consume.<P>

<b>4. Results</b><P>
Eighty-six out of 89 dogs (97%) fully consumed the alloted dosage within
the 15 minute time period.<P>
<b>5. Animal Safety:</b><P>

The animal safety of pyrantel pamoate oral dosage forms has been adequately
demonstrated per Pfizer's approved NADA 100-237. Pfizer, Inc. provided
authorization to Purina Mills, Inc. on 5/20/75 to refer to safety data
contained in Pfizer, Inc.  NADA's 91-739, 100-237 and 16-803 in support of NADA
101-331 on page 00035.  Pfizer letters dated July 7, 1987 and July 21, 1987
reaffirm authorization for Purina Mills Inc. to reference the above stated
NADA's.<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><P>

a. Human Food Safety:<p> As labeled, the drug poses no hazard to human safety pertaining to drug
residues, because it is labeled for use in dogs only.<P>

b. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:<p>  The
labeling contains an adequate caution statement.<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><P>

Data submitted satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrate that Purina Wormer Chewable Tablets (Pyrantel Pamoate ) when used
under its  proposed conditions of use are safe and effective for labeled
indications.<p>

The product is for  oral administration to dogs with adequate directions
for use which the layman can reasonably be expected to follow in practice.  The
agency therefore concluded that Purina Dog Wormer Chewable Tablets (Pyrantel
Pamoate), may be provided to the public on an over-the-counter basis.<P>

<br> Four hundred Arbor Acres x Peterson broiler chicks were caged in
environmentally-controlled animal rooms. Each cage contained 10 wing-banded
chicks (5 males and 5 females). Each of the five treatments (Table 1) were
replicated four times in each of the two studies. The chicks were fed an
unmedicated broiler starter feed until they were 12 days-of-age. At 12
days-of-age, chicks were weighed, stratified by body weight, randomly allocated
to cages and provided medicated feed. At 14 days-of-age, the chicks were weighed
and inoculated by oral gavage with mixed cultures of coccidia. The infective
cultures were <i>E. mitis, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. brunetti</i>&#160; in experiment
GA-B-118-85 and <i>E. acervulina, E. maxima </i>&#160;and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; in experiment
GA-B-118-85/2. The coccidia species that were used were recent isolates obtained
from commercial poultry farms in the United States.<P>Data, including death
losses, intestinal lesion scores, dropping scores, weight gain and feed
consumption were recorded over the 2 weeks following infection (Table 1). The
infections reduced weight gains in the infected controls when compared with the
uninfected controls. Treatment with monensin was effective in improving weight
gain in all instances, whether it was used alone or in combination with
bacitracin zinc. Lesion scores were recorded for the upper, mid and cecal areas
of the gut. Monensin was effective in controlling coccidiosis caused by the six
species of <i>Eimeria</i>&#160; in the broiler chickens. The use of bacitracin zinc
with monensin did not interfere with the anticoccidial action of monensin.<P>

In this experiment, 1400 chicks were housed in a conventional, dirt-floor broiler
house on the premises of Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX. Each 8 x
10 ft pen was identically equipped with a 6 ft mechanical water trough and
hanging tube-type feeders. Chicks were reared in a 22 hr photoperiod provided by
a 40 watt incandescent light over each pen. Bedding was used litter, topped with
a 1" layer of new pine shavings.<P>Fifty male and 50 female day-old, Cobb x
Hubbard chicks were allocated randomly to 14 experimental pens. Treatments were
assigned to pens in a randomized block design. Treatments were randomly assigned
to blocks of contiguous pens. The 14 experimental pens allowed for 7 replications
of the two treatments. The experiment consisted of two dietary treatments which
were monensin at 110 grams/ton and monensin at 110 grams/ton plus bacitracin zinc
at 50 grams/ton. The duration of the experiment was 47 days.<P>

</pre> <b>Summary of Floor-Pen Study</b><P>The three floor-pen experiments, using
2,720 broiler chickens were conducted in different geographical locations to
determine the growth promoting effects of bacitracin zinc in combination with
monensin. The studies were designed and conducted to simulate varying conditions
such as climate, geographical location, weather, management practices, and degree
of disease contamination of the premises.<P>Consistent with pen size 25 to 50
chicks of each sex were selected at random and assigned to pens. Six or 7
replicates were used per treatment group. Bacitracin zinc at 0 and 50 grams per
ton of feed was used in combination with monensin at 110 grams per ton of feed in
each study.<P>A pooled statistical analysis of the three experiments was
conducted. The data demonstrate that the addition of bacitracin zinc to the diet
at 50 grams per ton increased the rate of weight gain and improved feed
efficiency significantly (p &lt; .05) when compared to chicks fed monensin
alone.<P>
<b>Summary of Effectiveness Studies</b>

<P>The results of the effectiveness studies qualify this application for range approval for the drug
combination under CVM's Drug Combination Policy, revised October, 1983. The data
demonstrate that both drugs contributed to the effectiveness of the combination
drug.

<P>These data support approval of this application for the use of monensin at 90
to 110 grams per ton and bacitracin zinc at 4 to 50 grams per ton as an aid in
the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E.
maxima, E. mivati, E. necatrix, </i>&#160;and <i>E. tenella</i> &#160;and for increased rate
of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<P> 

<b>V. Animal Safety</b><P>

The basic animal safety data for the individual drugs may be found in the parent
NADAs (98-452 for bacitracin zinc and 38-878 for monensin). The effectiveness
studies shown in Section IV demonstrate that no ill effects occurred when the
drugs were combined indicating that they are as safe when fed in combination as
when fed alone.<br> 
<br>
This application is in accord with the Center's Target Animal
Safety Guidelines. Additional safety studies were not required because: (1) The
drugs have been approved singly and (2) adequate documentation has been provided
to show that these components are compatible in combination when used in broiler
chicken feeds. Therefore, based on the data in the original NADAs, the
non-interference study, the floor pen efficacy studies, and the drug residue
elimination study, this combination of drugs may be safely fed to broiler
chickens.<P><b>VI. Human Safety<P>A. Toxicity Tests</b><P> The toxicology data
that support the safety of residues of bacitracin zinc are filed in the parent
NADA 98-452 sponsored by A. L. Laboratories, Inc. (approved April 5 1976, 41 FR
14367). The toxicology data for monensin are contained in the parent NADA 38-878
sponsored by Elanco Products Co. (approved May 20, 1970, 35 FR 7734).<P>  
<b>B. Tolerances and Safe Concentrations of Residues</b><P> 
 
The tolerance for residues of bacitracin zinc in uncooked tissues of chickens
is established 
at 0.5 ppm, negligible residue (21 CFR 556.70).<P> 
 
A tolerance for residues of monensin in chickens is not established because the
total  
residues of the drug (parent + metabolites) are below the safe concentrations
for the drug 
at zero withdrawal. The safe concentrations for monensin total residues in
chicken tissues 
are: 1.5 ppm in muscle, 3.0 ppm in skin with adhering fat, and 4.5 ppm in liver
(21 CFR 
556.420).<P> 
 
<b>C. Tissue Residue Non-Interference Studies</b><P> 
 
Data to demonstrate that the residue levels of bacitracin zinc and monensin are
not 
adversely affected when the two drugs are fed in combination to broilers were
generated in 
two residue studies. Both studies used overdosing levels of bacitracin zinc.<P> 
 
<b>1. Non-interference on residues of monensin</b><P> 
 
The first non-interference study (CK-567) was conducted by Elanco Products
Company, 
and it provided data to demonstrate that residue levels of monensin are not
adversely 
affected by the presence of bacitracin zinc. The investigators were M.H. Gehle
and J.E. 
Wachtstetter.<P> 
 
The study was a combined residue and efficacy trial, and it involved 600
broiler chickens 
which received one of the following treatments:<P> 
 
A. control diet<br> 
B. bacitracin zinc at 500 g/ton<br> 
C. monensin at 110 g/ton plus bacitracin zinc at 500 g/ton.<P> 
 
The birds were fed the respective diets until 56 days of age at which time
groups were 
sacrificed at zero, 24 and 48 hours of withdrawal for the residue portion of
the study. At 
each of those withdrawal intervals, liver, muscle, kidney and fat samples were
collected 
from male and female birds. The samples were assayed for microbiologically
active 
residues of monensin by Lilly Method No. 5801330 to give six values at each
withdrawal 
interval.<P> 
 
Monensin residue levels in the range of 0.025 to 0.05 ppm or 0.05 to 0.10 ppm
were found 
in five of the six zero withdrawal fat samples. The other fat samples and all
muscle, liver 
and kidney samples showed no detectable residues of monensin.<P> 
 
Metabolism data generated under NADA 38-878 has shown that total residues of 
monensin in fat are well below the safe concentration in that tissue when
microbiologically 
active residues of the drug in fat are in the range of 0.025 to 0.10 ppm. The
monensin 
values reported above for monensin in fat tissue confirm that total residues of
the drug are 
below the safe concentrations for the drug in birds fed rations containing the
monensin 
plus bacitracin zinc combination.<P> 
 
<b>2. Non-interference on residues of bacitracin zinc</b><P> 
 
The non-interference on monensin residues by the presence of bacitracin zinc in
the 
combination was demonstrated in a second study conducted with the three-way 
combination of monensin, bacitracin zinc, and roxarsone. The dosing phase of
the study 
(MO-B-TR-1) was conducted for A. L. Laboratories by the Ponderosa Research
Company, 
French Village, Missouri, with Mr. Randall A. Primo as investigator. The assays
for 
bacitracin zinc (CK-568) in tissues were conducted by Northvale Analytical
Laboratory, 
Northvale, NJ.<P> 
 
The study involved two pens (12 birds each) of commercial broiler chicks. The
birds in one 
pen were fed a non-medicated control diet and the birds in the other pen were
fed a diet 
containing monensin (110 g/ton), bacitracin zinc (100 g/ton), and roxarsone
(45.5 g/ton). At 
48 days of age, three male and three female birds were withdrawn from the
medicated 
feed for 24 hours and killed to provide tissue samples at one day of
withdrawal. Six other 
birds received the medicated feed for 49 days and were killed at zero
withdrawal. Breast 
muscle tissue was collected, frozen, and shipped to the analytical
laboratory.<P> 
 
Assay of the medicated and unmedicated control muscle samples was conducted
using 
Northvale Analytical Laboratory Test Procedure Code No. 9A, Modified
Microbiological 
Method for Determination of Bacitracin in Tissues. The assays of all tissue
samples were 
negative (&lt; 0.1 ppm) for microbiologically active residues of bacitracin
zinc.<P> 
 
The residue non-interference studies described above confirm that, for the
two-way 
combination of monensin and bacitracin zinc, each drug in the presence of the
other does 
not exceed its approved safe concentration or tolerance. These data support a
zero 
withdrawal period for the use of this combination in broilers under CVM's
combination drug 
policy.<P> 
 
<b>D. Assay Non-Interference Studies</b><P> 
 
<b>1. Bacitracin zinc assay</b><P> 
 
The non-interference on the assay for bacitracin zinc by the presence of
residues of 
monensin was demonstrated by the assay of control samples of chicken muscle
that were 
spiked with bacitracin zinc (0.5 ppm) with and without monensin (0.5 ppm) and
roxarsone 
(0.5 ppm). The recovery values for both sets of samples were both about 85%,
indicating 
no interference in the assay.<P> 
 
<b>2. Monensin assay</b><P> 
 
A non-interference study on the bioautographic method for monensin was
conducted by 
spiking control tissue samples with monensin and bacitracin zinc and then
assaying these 
tissues for monensin content. The results demonstrated no interference by
bacitracin zinc 
for monensin.<P> 
 
<b>E. Regulatory Methods</b><P> 
 
<b>1. Bacitracin zinc</b><P> 
 
An analytical method for microbiologically active residues of bacitracin zinc
in tissues is 
described in the following reports: 1) "Antibiotic Residue in Milk, Dairy
Products and Animal 
Tissues: Methods, Reports, Protocols," National Center for Antibiotic Analyses,
Dept. HEW 
Washington DC 20204, Rev. October 1968; and 2) "Modified Method for
Determination of 
Bacitracin in Tissues," Test Procedure Code 9A, A. L. Laboratories, Inc., One
Executive 
Drive, PO Box 1399, Fort Lee, NJ 07024.<P> 
 
2. The use of monensin in chickens is approved under NADA 38-878 without the
need for 
a tolerance or an official regulatory method. However, analytical methods for
the drug are 
available such as the bioautographic methods that are used in non-interference
studies 
with monensin. A current bioautographic method is described in Part 5.044 of
the 
<i>Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook</i>&#160; published by the United States Department of 
Agriculture.<P> 
 
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions</b><P> 
 
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Sections
512 of the 
Act and demonstrate that monensin (90-110 g/ton) plus bacitracin zinc (4-50
g/ton) are 
safe and effective for the claims indicated in Section II of this FOI
Summary.<P> 
 
Pursuant to 21 CFR 514.106 (b)(2), this combination NADA approval is regarded
as a 
Category II supplemental change which did not require a reevaluation of the
safety and 
effectiveness data in the parent applications. The drugs are to be fed in Type
C Medicated 
feeds, in accordance with Section II and III of the FOI Summary and the Blue
Bird labeling 
that is attached to this document.<P> 
 
A residue study referenced in this application demonstrates that
microbiologically active 
residues of monensin at 0-day withdrawal will be 0.1 ppm or less in fat tissue
and 
generally nondetectable in other tissues when chickens are medicated with
the 
combination of bacitracin zinc and monensin. These levels correspond to total
residue 
levels (parent monensin plus its metabolites) much less than the monensin
safe 
concentrations of 1.5 ppm in muscle, 3.0 ppm in skin with adhering fat, and 4.5
ppm in 
liver.<P> 
 
A second residue study, which was contained in the application, demonstrates
that 
microbiologically active residues of bacitracin zinc at 0-day withdrawal will
be less than the 
0.5 ppm bacitracin tolerance when chickens are fed the combination of
bacitracin zinc and 
monensin.<P> 
 
Adequate information was submitted to demonstrate non-interference between the
assays 
for each drug. The approval of this application will not significantly increase
human 
exposure to drug residues.<P> 
 
Non-interference studies demonstrate that monensin in the presence of
bacitracin zinc 
prevented an outbreak of coccidiosis when the birds were exposed to the six
major 
species of Eimeria. The data from three well-controlled floor-pen studies
demonstrate the 
effectiveness of bacitracin zinc for increased rate of weight gain and improved
feed 
efficiency in broiler chickens in the presence of monensin. The policy outlined
in CVM's 
guideline for drug combinations for use in animals provides for the granting of
range 
approval for monensin (90-110 g/ton) as an aid in the prevention of coccidiosis
caused by 
<i>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati, E. necatrix, </i>&#160;and <i>E.
tenella;</i>&#160; for 
bacitracin zinc (4-50 g/ton) for increased rate of weight gain and improved
feed efficiency 
in broiler chickens.<P> 
 
Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, provides a
three-year 
period of exclusivity to NADAs for previously approved active ingredients that
require 
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or
residue studies) 
and, in the case of food producing animals, human food safety studies (other
than 
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application
and 
conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This new animal drug application
qualifies for 
such an exclusivity period which will expire three years from the date of the
approval letter.<P>

<b>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</b><p>

<b>1. <i>General Information</i></b><p>

<I>NADA</I>: 141-054	<p>
<I>Sponsor</I>:<p>

Merck Research Laboratories<br>
Division of Merck &#38; Co., Inc.<br>
P. O. Box 2000<br>
Rahway, New Jersey  07065<p>

<I>Established Names</I>:<p>

Ivermectin <br>
Lincomycin<p>

<I>Trade Names</I>:<p>

IVOMEC&#174; Premix for Swine, Type A Medicated Article<br>
LINCOMIX&#174; Premix, Type A Medicated Article<p>

<I>Marketing Status</I>: OTC<p>

<b>2. <i>Indications for Use</i></b><p>

Ivermectin:<p>

For the treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworms (<i>Ascaris
suum</i>, adults and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Ascarops strongylina</i>, adults;
<i>Hyostrongylus rubidus</i>, adults and fourth-stage larvae;
<i>Oesophagostomum</i> spp., adults and fourth-stage larvae), kidneyworms
(<i>Stephanurus dentatus</i>, adults and fourth-stage larvae), lungworms
(<i>Metastrongylus</i> spp., adults), lice (<i>Haematopinus suis</i>) and
mange mites (<i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i> var. <i>suis</i>).<p>

Lincomycin:<p>

*	Increased rate of weight gain in growing-finishing swine.<p>

*	For control of swine dysentery; for use in swine on premises with a
history of swine dysentery, but where symptoms have not yet occurred.<p>

*	For treatment and control of swine dysentery.<p>

*	For reduction in the severity of swine mycoplasmal pneumonia caused
by <i>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</i>.<p>

<b>3.	<i>Dosage Form, Route of Administration, and Recommended Dosage</i></b><p>

The route of administration is oral using a Type C medicated feed dosage
form.  Ivermectin and lincomycin are marketed as separate Type A
medicated articles.<p>

	IVOMEC Premix for Swine, Type A Medicated Article, contains 0.6% ivermectin
and is added to starter, grower and finisher feeds at 300 g/ton to supply 1.8 g
ivermectin per ton (2 ppm) of Type C medicated feed.  This feed provides approximately 100 mcg of ivermectin per kg of bodyweight per day.  Lincomycin Type A Medicated Article is sold in two concentrations of 20 and 50 grams of lincomycin per pound for preparing Type C medicated feeds at the following recommended dosages.<p>

20 g/ton:<br>	

For increased rate of gain in growing-finishing swine.<p>

40 g/ton:<br>
For control of swine dysentery.  For use in swine on premises with a history of swine dysentery, but where symptoms have not yet occurred.<p>

100 g/ton; 40 g/ton:<br>
For treatment and control of swine dysentery.<p>

100 g/ton:<br>
For treatment of swine dysentery.<p>

200 g/ton:<br>
For reduction in the severity of swine mycoplasmal pneumonia caused by <i>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</i>.<p>

The resultant feed containing both drugs is then fed as the only feed for
durations as specified in 21CFR 558.300 for ivermectin and 21CFR 558.325 for
lincomycin, but not for more than seven consecutive days which is the
recommended duration for ivermectin.  Feed containing ivermectin at 1.8 g/ton
and lincomycin at either 20 g/ton or 40 g/ton must be withdrawn 5 days prior to
slaughter.  Feed containing ivermectin at 1.8 g/ton and lincomycin at either
100 g/ton or 200 g/ton must be withdrawn 6 days prior to slaughter.<p>

<b>4. <i>Effectiveness</i></b><p>

IVERMECTIN:<p>

The efficacy data for ivermectin alone are located in NADA 140-974 FEDERAL
REGISTER, November 3, 1993 (58FR 58653).<p>

a.	Type of Study:<p>
A trial (ASR 14354) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin, in the presence of lincomycin, against endoparasites.<p>

b.	Investigator:<br>
<pre>
Dr. J. E. Holste
Merck Research Farm
6498 Jade Road
Fulton, Missouri 65251
</pre>

c.	General Design:<p>
Forty-eight crossbred piglets were used.  There were four treatment groups as follows:  nonmedicated control; ivermectin in feed at 2 ppm (1.8 g/ton) from Day 7 to 14; lincomycin in feed at 200 g/ton from Day -7 to 14; and ivermectin in feed at 2 ppm from Day 7 to 14, plus lincomycin at 200 g/ton from Day -7 to 14.  For each treatment group, there were six pens of 2 pigs each.  On Day -49, each animal was orally administered approximately 20,000 infective larvae of <i>Oesophagostomum</i> spp.  The animals were
necropsied by replicate for worm counting on Days 28 or 29.<p>

d.	Conclusion:<p>

The numbers of adult <i>Oesophagostomum</i> spp. were reduced
100% in the animals given ivermectin either alone or in combination with
lincomycin (p &#62; 0.01).  The effect of lincomycin and the interaction of
lincomycin and ivermectin were not significant (p &#62; 0.10).<p>

*	Controls:  A non-medicated infected control group was included in the study.
Treatments and controls were randomly assigned to pens within the 12 blocks of
eight pigs each.  All personnel conducting the study were unaware of the
medications in the feed for treatments A, B, C and D.<p>

*	Diagnosis:  A trained technician diagnosed swine dysentery based on the
clinical signs of diarrhea, dysentery and shedding of <i>S. hyodysenteriae</i>
in the feces.  Treatment was initiated in each group when at least 50% of the
pigs were shedding <i>S. hyodysenteriae</i> and at least 25% of the pigs were
exhibiting bloody feces.<p>

*	Dosage Forms:  LINCOMIX&#174; 50 and IVOMEC&#174; Premixes for
swine were mixed into the basal diet at the described levels to produce the
medicated feeds.<p>

*	Route of Administration:  Orally via medicated feed.<p>

*	Dosages Used:  <p>

Group A:<br>
Medicated feed containing 110 mg lincomycin plus 2 mg
ivermectin per kg feed (100 g lincomycin and 1.8 g ivermectin per ton of
feed).<p>

Group B:<br>
Unmedicated swine grower diet.<p>

Group C:<br>
Medicated feed containing 2 mg ivermectin per kg feed (1.8 g/ton).<p>

Group D:<br>
Medicated feed containing 110 mg lincomycin per kg feed (100
g/ton).<p>

*	Test Duration:  Twenty-eight (28) day combined treatment and observation
period.<p>

*	Pertinent Parameters Measured:  Mortality, survival days, dysenteric days,
physical activity, and spirochetal shedding days were the pertinent parameters
measured.<p>

*	Decision Variables:  Percent dysenteric days and percent shedding of
<i>S. hyodysenteriae</i> were the primary decision variables.<p>

d.	Statistical Analysis:<p>
Statistical analysis was performed on an experimental unit (pen) basis using Type III sums of squares from the general linear models (GLM) procedure of SAS&#174; according to the analysis of variance described in Table 3.  The percentages were expressed as pen percentages and a test of normality of the residuals was performed using Wilks'
W statistic (alpha= 0.05).  The homogeneity of the elements of the
test terms was tested using Levene's test at alpha = 0.01.<p>

<i>Effectiveness Study</i>:<p>

Lincomycin added at the rate of 200 g of lincomycin per 2000 lb of feed is
approved as therapy to reduce the severity of lesions caused by <i>Mycoplasma
hyopneumoniae </i>in swine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the <i>in
vitro</i> antimicrobial activity of lincomycin and ivermectin, alone and in
combination, against strains of <i>M. hyopneumoniae.</i><p>

The <i>in vitro</i> activity of lincomycin and ivermectin, alone and in
combination, against 15 strains of <i>M. hyopneumoniae</i> was determined.  In
addition, the effect of the glycerol-formal solvent used for ivermectin
reference standard on the activity of lincomycin was tested.  Against the
strains tested, ivermectin was not active with minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MIC) for all isolates &#62; 32.0 ug/mL.  Lincomycin,
lincomycin/ivermectin at a 3.1:1 (w/w) ratio, lincomycin/ivermectin at a 10:1
(w/w) ratio; and lincomycin dissolved in the glycerol-formal ivermectin solvent
all yielded MIC values of (&#60 or =) 0.5 ug/mL for all the strains tested.
Lincomycin, lincomycin/ivermectin at a 3.1:1 (w/w) ratio, and
lincomycin/ivermectin at a 10:1 (w/w) ratio were chosen because they reflect
the range of <i>in vivo</i> blood concentrations foe each drug.  The MIC values
for lincomycin alone and in combination with ivermectin and the solvent, were
within one serial dilution with all the strains tested.  These results suggest
that combining ivermectin with lincomycin does not affect the <i>in vitro</i>
activity of lincomycin against <i>M. hyopneumoniae.</i>  Table 5 summarizes
these data.<p>

*	Purpose of Study:  To compare the steady-state plasma concentrations of
lincomycin after administration of lincomycin alone and after administration of
lincomycin and ivermectin in swine feed.<p>

*	Test Animals:<p>
Thirty-two (32) healthy Yorkshire cross pigs (16 male/16 female), 2-4 months of age weighing 13.7-22.2 kg (30-49 lb).  The pigs were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups with an equal number of males and females allocated into each of the two treatment groups.  Both treatment
groups received lincomycin for 7 consecutive days (first through seventh day of the study).  Treatment Group A then received lincomycin for 7 consecutive days (eighth through fourteenth day of the study), whereas Group B received lincomycin feed for 7 consecutive days (days 15-21 of the study). Treatment Group B received lincomycin plus ivermectin for 7 consecutive days
(days 8-14 of the study), whereas Treatment Group A received lincomycin plus ivermectin for 7 consecutive days (days 15-21 of the study).  The treatment periods are illustrated by the following diagram.<p>

*	Controls:  The design and type of study required no unmedicated control
group.<p>

*	Dosage Forms:  LINCOMIX&#174; 50 and IVOMEC&#174; Premixes for
swine were mixed into the basal diet at the described levels to produce the
medicated feeds.<p>

*	Route of Administration:  Orally via medicated feed.<p>

*	Dosages Used:  220 g lincomycin/1000 kg feed (200 g/2000 lb) either alone or
with 2.0 g ivermectin/1000 kg feed (1.82 g/2000 lb).<p>

*	Test Duration:  Twenty-one (21) days.<p>

*	Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>
  Average lincomycin plasma concentrations
(Cavg) were evaluated for each pig/treatment by dividing the area under the
curve (AUC) determined on Day 13 and on Day 21 (hours 2 and 4 following the 8
AM and 4 PM doses) by the total blood sampling interval (12 hours).  All blood
samples were analyzed for lincomycin free base by Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS) with electron impact detection.<p>

*	Decision Criteria:<p>
  To confirm the absence of bias in the treatment
comparison due either to a lack of steady state conditions or to the presence
of a period by treatment interaction, Cavg values were obtained for each
treatment and period (see Table 6).  The 90% confidence intervals for
lincomycin concentrations on Days 13 and 21 were used to assess potential drug
interactions.  If the 90% confidence interval for the difference between
lincomycin plasma concentrations after lincomycin alone subtracted from those
after lincomycin plus ivermectin was greater than -0.20 times the mean
lincomycin concentrations after lincomycin alone, the conclusion was that
ivermectin did not interfere with lincomycin. <p>

d.	Results and Statistical Analysis:<p>
Consistent with the mean values presented in Table 6, no statistically significant period by treatment interactions were observed (P = 0.1550).  This verifies that the evaluation of the treatment effects represents an unbiased comparison.<p>

e. Conclusions:<p>

The presence of ivermectin (2.0 g ivermectin/1000 kg feed) in swine feed containing lincomycin hydrochloride (220 g lincomycin/1000 kg feed) does not reduce the systemic concentrations of lincomycin.  This demonstrates lack of substantial interference caused by ivermectin on lincomycin
pharmacokinetics in swine administered both lincomycin and ivermectin in the feed.<p>

C. Residue Depletion Non-Interference Study:<p>

A residue assay non-interference study was conducted.  The non-interference by
lincomycin in the ivermectin assay was shown in two phases.  The derivatization
of standards containing 29.0 or 58.0 mcg/mL lincomycin, 100 ng/mL
ivermectin or a combination of both analytes demonstrated that (a) lincomycin
does not produce a fluorescent derivative either with or without the presence
of ivermectin and (b) it does not change the retention time or sensitivity of
the ivermectin fluorescent peak.  In the second phase, control porcine liver
from the study was fortified with approximately 2300 ppb lincomycin,
approximately 20 ppb ivermectin or a combination of both.  No fluorescent peaks
were produced in the analysis of lincomycin by the ivermectin assay.  No peaks
representing lincomycin were observed under the ivermectin HPLC conditions.
The recovery of ivermectin alone from the three fortified samples was 89, 92
and 95%.  The recovery of ivermectin from the three samples fortified with
about 100 times as much lincomycin as ivermectin was 95, 89 and 95%.  These
equivalent results indicate that the presence of lincomycin in porcine liver
does not interfere with the ivermectin assay.  Also, ivermectin at 2 mcg/g was
found not to interfere with the microbiological cylinder plate assay for
lincomycin.<p>

	A tissue residue depletion study was conducted to determine the depletion of
the marker residues of ivermectin and lincomycin in liver (target tissue) of
swine administered lincomycin at its highest use level of 200 g/ton in
combination with ivermectin at its use level of 2 ppm (approximately 100
mcg/kg/day) in complete feed.  Medicated animals were given a basal ration
containing lincomycin at 200 g/ton on Day 0 through Day 14, then a ration
containing lincomycin at 200 g/ton and ivermectin at 2 ppm from Day 15 through
Day 21, followed by a non-medicated basal ration until study termination.
Three barrows and three gilts were sacrificed at each withdrawal time.
The withdrawal times following the end of the combination medication period
were 0 (within six hours after removal of medicated feed), 1, 2, 3 and 5 days.
One barrow and one gilt served as non-medicated control animals.  Marker
residue assays were performed on swine livers using the high pressure
liquid chromatography-fluorescence and microbiological cylinder/plate assay
determinative methods for ivermectin and lincomycin, respectively.  The average
or mean marker residue concentrations found were as follows:<br>

  and the range would be 2-25 ppb.<p>

</pre>

The marker residue tolerance (Rm) for ivermectin in swine liver is 20 ppb.
Statistical analysis of the depletion data, using the upper tolerance limit
containing 99 percentile of the population with 95% confidence, yields a
withdrawal period of 5 days.  The withdrawal periods for both ivermectin and
lincomycin are unaltered for use of these drugs in combination at their highest
approved use levels.<p>

D.	Regulatory Methods:<p>

The validated regulatory analytical methods for detection of the marker
residue of ivermectin are filed in the Food Additives Manual on display in
FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, MD  20857).<p>

A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for lincomycin
residues.  The method titled "Determination of Lincomycin Residues in
Broiler Chicken Tissues" is filed in the Food Additives Manual on display in
FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, MD  20857).<p>

<b>7. <i>Agency Conclusions</i></b><p>

The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that the combination of
ivermectin and lincomycin, Type A medicated articles, when mixed to produce a
Type C medicated feed and fed to weaned, growing, and finishing pigs under the
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the indications stated on
the product labeling.<p>

For swine the marker residue tolerance and/or safe concentration of residues
for ivermectin and lincomycin are as specified in 21 CFR 556.344 and 21 CFR
556.360, respectively.  The marker residue tolerance (Rm) for ivermectin in
swine liver is 20 ppb.  A tolerance for lincomycin of 0.1 ppm is established
for negligible residues in the edible tissues.  A residue assay
non-interference study was conducted.  The non-interference by lincomycin in
the ivermectin assay was shown in two phases.  A tissue residue depletion study
was conducted to determine the depletion of the marker residues of ivermectin
and lincomycin in liver (target tissue) of swine administered lincomycin at its
highest use level of 200 g/ton in combination with ivermectin at its use level
of 2 ppm (approximately 100 mcg/kg/day) in complete feed.  This study
demonstrates that the withdrawal periods for both ivermectin and lincomycin are
unaltered for use of these drugs in combination at their highest approved use
levels.  The withdrawal times are 5 days for 20 g/ton and 40 g/ton lincomycin
in combination with 1.8 g/ton ivermectin and 6 days for 100 g/ton and 200 g/ton
lincomycin in combination with 1.8 g/ton ivermectin (21 CFR 558.300 and 21 CFR
558.325).<p>

The original approvals of ivermectin and lincomycin, Type A medicated articles,
were for over-the-counter use.  Approved products containing ivermectin and
lincomycin alone, for the same claims as are on the label for the combination
product, are on the market.  Adequate directions for use have been written for
the layman, and the conditions for use prescribed on the labeling are likely to
be followed in practice.  Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)
has concluded that this product shall have over-the-counter marketing
status.<p>

Several efficacy trials using the combination were performed at various doses
of lincomycin.  A dose confirmation non-interference study was conducted to
evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin (1.8 g/ton), in the presence of lincomycin
(200 g/ton), against endoparasites.  A dose confirmation non-interference
clinical study was performed to assess the efficacy of lincomycin  at 100 g/ton
for 14 days when used in combination with ivermectin at 1.8 g/ton for the
first seven days for the treatment of induced swine dysentery.  An
effectiveness study was performed to evaluate the <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial
activity of lincomycin and ivermectin, alone and in combination, against
strains of <i>M. hyopneumoniae.</i>  Lincomycin added at the rate of 200 g/ton
is approved as therapy to reduce the severity of lesions caused by
<i>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae </i>in swine.  A pharmacokinetic
non-interference study  was performed to compare the steady-state plasma
concentrations of lincomycin after administration of lincomycin alone (200
g/ton) and after administration of lincomycin (200 g/ton) and ivermectin (1.8
g/ton) in swine feed.  These studies demonstrated that ivermectin and
lincomycin do not interfere with the efficacy of each other and that both drugs
are efficacious in the presence of one another.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food-producing animals qualifies for THREE years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of the approval because the application
contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to this approval and conducted or
sponsored by the applicant.<p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-027;
generic nicarbazin), Planalquimica Industrial Ltda. is entitled to the approval
of generic nicarbazin in combination with roxarsone.  Bioequivalence studies
are not required for the approval of this generic combination (Type C medicated
feed).  Nicarbazin is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.366.  Roxarsone
(3-Nitro&#174;) is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.530.  The combination of
nicarbazin and roxarsone is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.366(c).<P>
<P>
<P>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
<b>Tolerances for Marker Residues </b><P>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product.  <P>
A tolerance of 4.0 ppm is established for residues of nicarbazin in uncooked
chicken muscle, liver, skin, and kidney under 21 CFR &#167;556.445.<P>
Tolerances for total residues of arsenic (calculated as As) from roxarsone are
established for chicken tissues as 0.5 ppm in uncooked muscle and 2 ppm in
uncooked edible by-products under 21 CFR &#167;556.60.<P>
<b>Withdrawal Time</b><P>
A 5-day withdrawal time is established for chickens receiving the
combination of nicarbazin and roxarsone under 21 CFR &#167;558.366.  A tissue
residue depletion study submitted under ANADA 200-027 supports the use of the
pioneer drug withdrawal time for the generic nicarbazin product.<P>
<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><P>
The analytical method for the determination of roxarsone in tissues is a
spectrophotometric method.  The method is titled "Arsenic (Total) Residues in
Animal Tissues, Spectrophotometric Method," published in the 14th Edition of
<i>AOAC Official Methods of Analysis</i>, Method 41.009, page 777.<P>
The determinative procedure for quantifying nicarbazin residues in chicken
tissues is a liquid chromatographic assay with UV detection of
4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the marker residue for nicarbazin.  The identity
of DNC is confirmed by thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
The reference for the regulatory method is:  J.L. Lewis, T.D. Macy, and D.A.
Garteiz; <i>J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem.</i> <b>72</b>(4):  577-581.<P>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of nicarbazin and roxarsone, when used under
its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled
indications.<P>

<b>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</b><p>
<b>I.  NADA No. </b>139-858<p>
<b>Sponsor:</b><p>  American Cyanamid Company<br> Agricultural Division   <br>
    Wayne, New Jersey 07470<p>
<b>Generic Components: </b> Levamisole resinate and famphur  <p>
<b> Trade Name:</b>  TRAMISOL&#174; X-TRA (Trademark of American Cyanamid Company)<p>
<b>Marketing Status: </b> Over the Counter (OTC)<p>
<b>Description: </b><p>   The efficacy and safety of existing oral dosage forms of
levamisole and famphur for cattle have been proven in NADAs   34-266,   39-356,
 39-357,   44-015 and 126-237.   This summary contains new data pertaining to
the safety and effectiveness of an alternate dosage form of each of these two
drugs when administered as a combination levamisole resinate/famphur paste via
an oral dispensing device.  All dose titration, dose confirmation, safety,
bioavailability and residue depletion studies are summarized in this
outline.<p>
<b>Date of Approval:  </b>June 16, 1988<p>
<b>II.   Indications for Use:</b><p>
For treatment of cattle infected with the following parasites: <p>
STOMACH WORMS:  <i>Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia</i><p>
INTESTINAL WORMS:  <i>Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, Nematodirus, Bunostomum,
Oesophagostomum</i><p>
LUNGWORMS:  <i>Dictyocaulus</i><p>
BITING LICE:  <i>Bovicola</i><p>
SUCKING LICE:  <i>Linognathus, Solenoptes</i><p>
It is not effective against lice eggs. <p>
<b>III.  Dosage Form:</b><p>
TRAMISOL X-TRA Combination Paste contains levamisole resinate (50%) and famphur
as active ingredients packed in a polyethylene cartridge-type container.
TRAMISOL X-TRA is formulated to provide 8 mg/kg (3.6 mg/lb) of body weight of
levamisole HCl equivalent activity and 30 mg/kg (13.6 mg/lb) of body weight of
famphur activity which has been demonstrated to be the optimum dose level for
effective performance the product's anthelmintic and ectoparasitic label
claims.<p>
   
TRAMISOL X-TRA is administered to cattle in individual oral doses using the
compatible GelGun &#174;oral dispensing device.  The product has been
designed so that each distinct depression of the Gel Gun trigger or "click"
delivers a 0.18 g levamisole and 0.68 g famphur activity which is the
appropriate dose for each 50 lb body weight.  In practice TRAMISOL X-TRA is
administered by setting the Gel Gun weight selector for the approximate weight
of the animal to be treated, directing the nozzle of the cartridge through the
interdental space and squeezing the trigger two times directing the paste over
the tongue into the animal's throat.<p>
<b>IV. Animal Efficacy:  </b><p>
For the levamisole/famphur combination drug the data establishes
non-interference of each drug in the drug combination.  The data documents that
the combination drug is superior to famphur for endoparasites and to levamisole
alone for the ectoparasites.<p>
<b>Famphur</b><p>
Famphur is approved in cattle as a pour-on (NADA  34-697; 21 CFR 524.900) and
as medicated feed (NADA  34-266; 21 CFR 558.254).<p>
The efficacy of the famphur component of the levamisole/famphur combination
paste was determined in 8 dose titration trials conducted 
in the fall of 1984 and early 1985.  Five of these trials were conducted to
evaluate the optimum dose of famphur against grubs and three trials were
conducted to measure effectiveness against lice in cattle.  A list of these
trials is provided in the accompanying table.<p>

<b>Summary of Grub Trials</b><p>
Five-trials were conducted in various regions of the United States and
consisted of five treatment groups.  The treatments were a negative control
which received no grubicide, and a positive control that received WARBEX&#174;
 Pour-On at 40 mg/kg.  Three of the treatment groups received the
combination paste in which the famphur was administered orally at 10, 20, and
30 mg/kg.  All animals received a dose of levamisole at 8 mg/kg.<p>
The trial locations adequately covered all regions of the United States along
with the various breeds and crossbreeds of cattle to which this paste may be
administered in the U.S. for control of grubs.  The majority of the trials
contained both heifers and steers.  Both species of grub, <i>Hypoderma
 lineatum, </i> the common grub, and <i>Hypoderma bovis, </i>the northern cattle
grub, were represented in almost all the trials.  Various degrees of infection
rates were present for dose titration and efficacy evaluation.<p>
For statistical analysis of the data, transformation of the grub counts was
necessary in order to minimize the heterogeneity of variance among the
treatment groups.  Treating the trials as replicates, the ANOVA on the
transformed data was performed for a balanced, completely randomized design.<p>
 Treatment groups that received oral famphur at 30 mg/kg and WARBEX&#174;
Pour-On had significantly fewer grubs (p&lt;0.05) than the negative control and
demonstrated grub control superior to the two treatment groups that received
oral famphur in the combination paste formulation at 10 and 20 mg/kg.  There
was no significant difference in grub control between the oral famphur dosed at
30 mg/kg in the combination paste formulation and the WARBEX Pour-On group.<p>
The back transformed mean grub counts from the five trials for the negative
control, groups that received oral famphur at 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg, and the
WARBEX&#174; Pour-On group were 8.6, 1.4, 1.5, 0.3 and 0.3, respectively.  As
compared to the negative control, the grub reduction for oral famphur
administered at 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg and the WARBEX&#174; Pour-On group was 84,
83, 97, and 97%, respectively.<p>

<b>Summary of Lice Trials</b><p>

Three trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy against lice with the
combination paste.  The three predominant lice species were evaluated, which
included <i>Linognathus vituli, </i>the long nose cattle louse, <i>Bovicola
bovis, </i>the cattle biting louse and <i>Solenoptes capillatus, </i>the little
blue cattle louse.  Animals in different treatment groups were maintained in
separate pens to prevent cross infestations.  All treatments were administered
mid-winter in which peak lice infestations were present.<p> 
Animal numbers per treatment group, number of treatment groups, number 
of examinations per animal, and method of recording counts varied from one
trial site to another.  Thus the data from the trials were not combined for a
statistical analysis.<p>

In all three trials, famphur was effective against adult lice at oral dosages
of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg.  There appeared to be very little  
difference among the three oral dosages since all three doses eliminated  
the adult lice populations on the cattle.  One hundred percent reduction  
in adult lice was usually observable by 3 days posttreatment.

Reinfestation occurred between 7 and 28 days posttreatment.  This  
appeared to be dependent upon the severity of the lice infestation.  The  
reinfestation of lice in the oral famphur treatment groups is attributed  
to egg hatch and new maturing nits.  The oral famphur was effective at  
eliminating the adult population of all three predominant species of lice from
the cattle.  The WARBEX&#174; Pour-On treatment eradicated the lice populations
on all animals for the complete duration of each trial.<p>

In summary, the optimum dose for famphur in the levamisole/famphur paste
combination for efficacy against grubs and lice in cattle appears to be  
dependent on the results of the dose titration data against grubs.  An  
oral dose of 30 mg/kg offered significantly (p&lt;0.05) better control of grubs
than the negative control group and was superior to the treatment groups in
which oral famphur was administered at 10 and 20 mg/kg.  The  
percent reduction as compared to the negative control was greater than 95%.
This excellent percent control was obtained from results of dose titration
field trials in which 84 animals were orally administered the combination paste
at 30 mg famphur/kg body weight and under conditions of natural grub
infections.  The oral famphur administered at 30 mg/kg eliminated the adult
lice populations on cattle.  The data clearly demonstrated that a
levamisole/famphur combination paste formulated to deliver oral famphur at 30
mg/kg is commercially acceptable for control of grubs and lice in cattle.<p>

<b>Levamisole</b><p>
Levamisole is currently approved in cattle in several dosage forms as the
hydrochloride salt (NADAs  39-356; 21 CFR 520.1242b,  39-357; 21 CFR 520.1242a,
 44-015;  21 CFR 558.315 and 126-237;  21 CFR 520.1242f).  Efficacy for the
levamisole component of the levamisole resinate/famphur combination paste is
supported by a bioavailability study with TRAMISOL GEL (NADA 126-237; 21 CFR
520.1242f).<p>
Because of (1) the different modes of actions of famphur and levamisole, (2)
lack of ectoparasites activity of levamisole, (3) limited activity of famphur
against endoparasites at the proposed use level, (4) prior documentation of the
correlation between effectiveness and blood levels on levamisole, and (5) the
level of effectiveness of levamisole against endoparasites, the combination
drug requirements were adequately documented by the pharmacokinetic parameters
of a blood level study. That is, the data evaluates the effect of famphur on
the bioavailabilityof levamisole.<p>
  
<b>Bioavailability Study</b><p>
This study was conducted by Dr. T.R. Garces at the Agricultural Research Center
of American Cyanamid Company.  A comparison to TRAMISOL&#174; Gel (NADA
126-237; 21 CFR 520.1242f) was done in a two phase crossover design with 6
animals per group.  Blood samples were collected periodically for 24 hours
posttreatment.<p>
Statistical analysis of the data was conducted by use of Multivariate 
Analysis of Variance.  Phase or animal effects were not significantly 
different as determined by Wilk's Lambola criteria.  The treatment 
effect was significant at the 5% level.  The administration of the 
levamisole/famphur paste at 8 mg levamisole hydrochloride equivalent and 
30 mg famphur/kg indicates that the bioavailability of the levamisole in 
the combinations paste is as good as the TRAMISOL Gel. <p>
Therefore, the present formulation of the levamisole/famphur paste will provide
therapeutic levamisole blood levels to support the efficacy against the nine
internal cattle nematodes that TRAMISOL&#174; Gel has received approval
for in NADA 126-237; 21 CFR 520.1242f.<p>
<b>V.  Animal  Safety</b><p>
  The safety of levamisole HCl was previously established in
cattle in  39-356,  39-357, 44-015 and 126-237.  The resinate salt was the
subject of safety studies in laboratory species and in swine in NADA 101-079;
21 CFR 520.1242d.  The safety of famphur, when administered either as a pour-on
(NADA 34-697; 21 CFR 524.900) or in medicated feed (NADA 34-266; 21 CFR
558.254), was also previously established in cattle.  In addition, a formal
safety study was conducted with the proposed levamisole/famphur combination
paste administered orally at various multiples of the dose levels recommended
on the proposed labeling.  Four groups of cattle (three males and three females
per group) were administered the paste to provide a levamisole (HCl equivalent)
dose of 0, 8, 16, and 24 mg/kg and famphur at , 30, 60, and 90 mg/kg.  The
negative control, 1X, 2X, and 3X dosage of the recommended dose was used for
the safety study.  The animals were observed by a veterinarian who is
experienced in the clinical observations of drug toxicities.  Periodic blood
samples were taken for various hematological and blood chemistry
determinations.  The animals remained in the same groups and received a similar
dose of the paste 28 days following the initial treatment.  The animals were
sacrificed seven days following the second treatment for gross pathological and
histological examination.<p>
No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in the control animals.  One animal
receiving the lX dose exhibited muzzle foam following the initial treatment;
however, no adverse clinical signs appeared in the six animals following the
second treatment 28 days later.<p> 
Muzzle foam and tenesmus were observed in all animals receiving the 2X and 3X
doses of the paste.  Three animals in the 3X dose also displayed some head
shaking and hyperexcitability.  All clinical signs had dissipated within 24
hours posttreatment.  Anorexia was observed in the 2X and 3X treated animals
for the next two days.  All appetites had  returned to normal after three days
posttreatment.  Similar observations of clinical toxicities were made at the
28-day treatment period for both the 2X and 3X treated animals.  The degree of
severity of the clinical signs of drug toxicity exhibited by the cattle in both
treatment phases were considered mild.<p>
Mean blood chemistry results indicate that the values for total protein, serum
glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase were within
acceptable normal limits for all the groups at all intervals.  Statistically
significant differences (p&lt;0.05) compared to controls were observed in the
calcium, phosphatase, albumin, uric acid, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen,
and glucose in different groups at various time intervals.  These differences
are considered biologically insignificant, since the mean values were within
the normal range for cattle and attributed to the inherent variability of blood
chemistry values among animals.  No relationship could be established between
the sporadic animals.  No relationship could be established between the
sporadic significant differences in blood chemistries and clinical signs
exhibited by the 2X and 3X dose groups or the gross and histopathological
examinations of these animals.<p> 
The plasma cholinesterase values were significantly (p&lt;0.05) depressed as
compared to control levels for 14 days posttreatment in the 1X, 2X, and 3X
treatment groups.  This biological manifestation was expected since famphur is
an organophosphate.  These values returned to normal and there were no
significant differences in plasma cholinesterase at 28 days posttreatment for
all treatment groups.<p>
The only significant difference observed in the hematological measurements was
an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the 3X dose group at 28 days
posttreatment and   days posttreatment for the second treatment.<p>
No gross pathology was observed on necropsy that would be attributed to drug
treatment.<p>
There were no histological lesions that could be attributed to drug induced
damage found in any tissues examined.<p>
In summary, the major treatment related effects were characterized by clinical
responses in the animals treated with 2X and 3X doses of the levamisole/famphur
paste.  These clinical signs of toxicity are judged to be mild and transitory
in nature, with no apparent pathogenesis to any major organ system.  This was
further substantiated by both gross and histopathological findings.  The
recommended dose of 8 mg levamisole HCl equivalent and 30 mg famphur/kg was
demonstrated to be safe for use in cattle.<p>
<b>VI. Human Safety</b><p>
<b>1.  Toxicity Tests</b><p>
The toxicity data that support the use of levamisole and famphur in cattle are
contained in the approved NADAs listed below.<p>
Levamisole:  NADAs 39-356; 21 CFR 520.1242b and 039-357; 21 CFR 520. 1242a<p>
Famphur:     NADA 34-266; 21 CFR 558.254<p>
<b>2.   Safe Concentrations of Residue</b><p>
The tolerance for famphur in edible tissues appears in 40 CFR 180.233 and is
listed as 0.1 ppm of the parent drug plus its oxygen analog metabolite,
famophoxon.<p>
The tolerance for levamisole in the edible tissues of cattle is 0.1 
ppm levamisole hydrochloride as listed in 21 CFR 556.350.<p>
<b>3.  Residue Depletion Studies</b><p>
Two residue depletion studies were conducted for the purpose of determining a
withdrawal time for the levamisole/famphur combination.  The first study
involved 23 Hereford cattle with an 
average weight of 355 kg.  Twenty of the cattle received a single oral dose of
the levamisole/famphur paste at the recommended label 
dosage of 8 mg levamisole HCl equivalent and 30 mg famphur per kg body weight.
The treated cattle were sacrificed in groups of four 
at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days post treatment, and samples of muscle, 
liver, kidney and fat were collected.  The remaining three cattle served to
provide control tissue samples.<p>
Samples of the four tissues were assayed for famphur and its oxygen analog,
famophoxon, while only liver, the target tissue for levamisole, was assayed for
that drug.  Average residue values for famphur in fat and liver tissue and
levamisole in liver tissue are shown below.  The assay for famphur in muscle
yielded no positive values while two out of four kidney samples at 3 days and
one out of four samples at 6 days yielded positive responses near the
tolerance.  No tissue samples were positive for famophoxon.<p>

    The second residue depletion study was similar in format to the 
first and involved 20 treated and 3 control Hereford cattle having a weight
range of 181 to 414 kg.  The animals were dosed in the 
same fashion as in the first study but were sacrificed in groups of 
four at the shorter schedule of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days post dosing. 
Samples of liver and omental fat were collected and assayed for 
famphur, famophoxon and levamisole (liver only).  The average levels (ppm) of
residues are shown below.<p>

 The analytical method for famphur in both studies was the official 
AOAC method which was modified to include the use of a disposable solid-phase
silica gel column in the cleanup procedure.  The method used for the assay of
levamisole was the official AOAC method which was modified to include the use
of solid-phase extraction with a disposable strong cation exchange column in
the cleanup procedure.  Both methods gave excellent recoveries at spiking
levels of 0.05 
ppm.<p>
<b>4.  Withdrawal Time Calculation</b><p>
The depletion data from the two residue studies described above
were subjected to a statistical analysis using a 99% tolerance limit
with 95% confidence.  Withdrawal times were calculated based on the depletion
of famphur in fat and liver and on levamisole in liver. That procedure yielded
a withdrawal time of 19 days for the levamisole famphur combination based on
the depletion of famphur in fat tissue in the first study.<p>
<b>5.  Assay Noninterference Studies</b><p>
The following studies were conducted to demonstrate that the presence of each
drug in the levamisole/famphur combination did not have an adverse effect on
the assay of the other drug.  The results of this work confirmed that neither
drug interfered with the assay for the other.<p>
<b>a.  Levamisole Assay</b><p>
The effect of the presence of famphur and famophoxon on the assay for
levamisole was determined by analyzing control liver tissue (the target for
levamisole) fortified with famphur and famophoxon each with levamisole at the
following levels:  0.0, 0.5, 0.10, 3.0 and 5.0 ppm.  The recoveries were
generally in the acceptable range and confirmed that neither famphur nor
famophoxon interfered with the assay for levamisole.<p>
<b>b.  Famphur and Famophoxon Assay</b><p>
The effect of levamisole on the determination of famphur and famophoxon was
demonstrated by the use of control samples of fat and liver that had been
fortified with levamisole at 1 ppm and famphur and famophoxon at 0.0, 0.05,
0.1, and 1.0 ppm each. The assays for famphur and famophoxon gave acceptable
recoveries and confirmed that the presence of levamisole does not interfere
with the assay.<p>
   <b> VII.  Agency Conclusions</b><p>        
   The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the 
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that     levamisole
resinate/famphur combination paste when used under its proposed conditions of
use are safe and effective.     <p>
For the purpose of a human food safety review, this original NADA           for the
combination product was treated as if it were a Category         II supplemental
NADA (42 FR 64367, December 22, 1977).  Each of     the active ingredients is
presently approved for oral    administration to the same production class of
animals.  Based on     its review of the data submitted with this NADA and the
data        in the approved NADA's for the individual products, the Agency
concluded that the qualitative composition of the residues of       famphur and
levamisole is not expected to change when the       combination product is
administered. Because of the new dosing     form and dosing scheme for famphur
and its use in the combination      product, the sponsor submitted a residue
depletion study to      establish a withdrawal period for the combination
product.  The       amount of residue of the drugs that remains at the end of
the     withdrawal time is not appreciably different than the amount
found when the drugs are used separately.  Although the dosage of       the
drugs in the combination is higher than for the drugs when      used
separately, the withdrawal time for the combination is      longer, and the
cumulative exposure is the same.
    <p>
The Agency concludes that adequate directions for use by the lay persons have
been written for the proposed over-the-counter use of this anthelmintic and
ectoparasitic drug which is indicated for the treatment of endo- and
ecto-parasites commonly occurring in cattle.  Some of the adverse reactions,
such as muzzle foam, salivation, etc., occasionally observed after the
treatment can be readily recognized by persons involved in rearing cattle.  A
 thorough review of the current safety data submitted under the subject NADA
indicates that the incidence of adverse reactions with the combination product
would not be different from those already observed either with levamisole or
famphur in field-use condition.  Moreover, a review of the Adverse Drug
Reaction reports submitted during the past 5 to 6 years also indicates that the
reported deaths in small number of animals (9 with levamisole and 7 with
famphur) were unrelated to the treatment with either drug.  Both levamisole
resinate and famphur are presently marketed separately over-the-counter as
endoparasitic and ectoparasitic drug products, respectively.<p>

    <b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
<b></b>     In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989,
as published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107),
following the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article
(ANADA 200-075; generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company
is entitled to the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with
roxarsone and chlortetracycline.  Bioequivalence studies are not required for
the approval of this generic combination (Type C medicated feed).  Salinomycin
sodium is codified under 21 CFR 558.550.  Roxarsone is codified under 21 CFR
558.530.  Chlortetracycline is codified under 21 CFR 558.128.  The combination
of salinomycin sodium, roxarsone, and chlortetracycline is codified under 21
CFR 558.550(b)(1)(xv).<p>
<b> 3.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>a.   Tolerances and Safe Concentration for the Marker Residue</b><p>
    The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. <p>
    The safe concentrations for total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible
tissues of broiler chickens were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in
liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat.<p>
    Tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline are established at 1.0 ppm in the
uncooked muscle, liver, fat, and skin and 4.0 ppm in uncooked kidney of broiler
chickens (21 CFR 556.150).<p>
    Tolerances of arsenic (from roxarsone) are established at 0.5 ppm in uncooked
muscle and 2 ppm in uncooked edible by-products of broiler chickens with liver
as the target tissue (21 CFR 556.60).<p>
<b>b.   Withdrawal Time</b><p>
    Based on the information in 21 CFR 558.550(b)(1)(xv), a 5-day withdrawal time
is required for the combination of salinomycin, chlortetracycline, and
roxarsone.<p>
<b>c.   Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
    Under NADA 128-686 a regulatory method for salinomycin was not required
because residue levels in all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and
skin/fat) were significantly below the established safe concentration for total
residues.<p>
    The regulatory analytical method for the determination of residue of
chlortetracycline is a microbiological test using <i>Bacillus cereus</i>&#160;var.

<b>2.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data, drug
effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>

The generic product was the subject of an approved suitability petition (CP
92P-0363), in which the Agency granted permission to Phoenix Scientific, Inc.,
to file and ANADA for changes in the dosage form and in strength, relative to
the pioneer product.  The generic product if formulated as a solution, and the
pioneer product if formulated as a water soluble powder.  The generic product
is formulated at 200 mg neomycin sulfate/mL, and the pioneer product if
formulated at 325 g neomycin sulfate/pound of product.  The pioneer and generic
and generic products will be administered as oral solutions in water or milk,
at a dosage of 10 mg neomycin sulfate per pound of body weight in divided doses
for a maximum of 14 days.<p>

As a separate action, based upon the formulated characteristics of the pioneer
and generic products, Phoenix Scientific, Inc., was granted a waiver form
conducting an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence study.  The pioneer and generic
product does not contain any active ingredients that may significantly affect
absorption of the active ingredient.<p>

<b>3.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>

<b>Tolerance </b><p>

The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.  A tolerance of 0.25 ppm is established for neomycin residues in the
uncooked edible tissues of cattle, swine, sheep, and goats and a tolerance of
0.15 ppm is established for milk (<B>21 CFR 556.430</B>).<p>

<b>Withdrawal Period</b><p>

When a waiver of <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence testing is granted, the
withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer product. <p>
The withdrawal times are 30 days for cattle (excluding veal calves) and goats
and 20 days for swine and sheep (<B>21 CFR 520.1485</B>). <p>

<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>

The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> suspension.  The
method is published  by the Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues
in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols",
revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974. <p>

<b>4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that neomycin sulfate when used under the proposed conditions of
use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<br>

<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b></b> Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New

based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.  <br>
<br>
    Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Fermenta
Animal Health Company was granted a waiver November 19, 1990, (photocopy
attached) from conducting an <i> in vivo</i>&#160;   bioequivalence study with
Gentamicin Sulfate Solution 100 mg/mL.  The generic and pioneer products are
solutions with the same inactive ingredients and the same concentrations of the
active ingredient.<br>
<br>
<b>3.   HUMAN SAFETY:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b> Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b> </b>Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were
not required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is labeled for use in
horses not intended for food.<br>
<br>
    <b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b> </b>Labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<br>
<br>
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>
<b></b> <br>
    This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA)          filed under
Section 512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and            Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act.

    Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug,              Gentamicin Sulfate
Solution 100 mg/mL, were  
    established by demonstration of chemical equivalence to the    
    pioneer product, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation's Gentocin&#174;
Solution (gentamicin sulfate, 100 mg/mL, NADA 046-724).<p>
    This generic product and the pioneer product have identical             labeling
indications for use.  The route and method of               administration of the two
drugs are identical.  Both drugs are            administered by intrauterine infusion.
The generic and pioneer products are    both solutions that contain the same
active and inactive                 ingredients in the same concentrations.  Both products
have the 
    same pH.  Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy promulgated to   implement
Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety,   efficacy, or
 <I>in vivo</i>&#160;    bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.<p>
    This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Gentamicin Sulfate Solution 100 mg/mL is safe and effective
for its labeled indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

<TITLE>NADA 138-869 Triamcinolone Acetonide</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><B>Freedom Of Information Summary</B><P>
<B>I. General Information:</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>NADA Number:</B> 138-869<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sponsor:</B><BR> 
<BR>
Med-Tech, Inc.<BR>
A Division of TechAmerica Group, Inc.<BR>
P.O. Box 338<BR>
Elwood, Kansas  66024<BR>
<BR>
<B>Generic Name:</B> Triamcinolone Acetonide<BR>
<BR>
<B>Trade Name:</B> Triamcinolone Acetonide Injection, 2 mg/ml &amp; 6 mg/ml<BR>
<BR>
<B>Marketing Status:</B> Rx<BR>
<BR>
<B>Date Stamped:</B> January 6, 1987<BR>
<BR>

<B>II. Indications For Use:</B><P>
Triamcinolone acetonide is a highly potent glucocorticoid effective in the
treatment of inflammation and related disorders in dogs,  cats and horses.   It
is  also  indicated for use in  the management and  treatment of acute
arthritis  and  allergic  and dermatologic disorders in dogs and cats.<P>
The  product  is  recommended  for  intramuscular,  subcutaneous,
intra-articular and  intrasynovial  injection  in dogs,  cats  and horses and
intralesional injection in dogs and cats.<P>
<B>III. Dosage:</B><P>
The keystone of satisfactory therapeutic management with triamcinolone
acetonide, as with other steroids, is individualization of dosage in reference
to the severity of the disease, the anticipated duration of steroid therapy and
the animal's threshold or tolerance for steroid excess.   The prime objective
of steroid therapy should be to achieve a satisfactory degree of control with a
minimum effective dose.  To minimize the adverse effects from withdrawal or
reduction in dosage, cautiously decrease dosage in a gradual  manner.   In
dogs,  dosing  in  the morning may also be beneficial   in  minimizing  effects
because  nocturnal   pituitary/adrenal activity will be less inhibited.  In
chronic conditions, and in rheumatoid arthritis especially, it is important
that the reduction in dosage from initial  to maintenance dose levels be
accomplished slowly.<P>
<B>Intramuscular Or Subcutaneous Dosage And Administration</B><P>
Following intramuscular injection of triamcinolone acetonide, a
prolonged systemic effect results.  The dose may vary with the size of the
animal, the severity of the  condition being treated and the animal's  response
to therapy.<P>
<B>Dogs  and  Cats:</B><BR><BR> The recommended dosage is 0.05 mg to 0.1 mg triamcinolone
acetonide per pound body weight as a single injection for the treatment of
inflammatory or allergic disorders.  For the treatment of dermatologic disorders,
administer a single injection of 0.l mg per pound body weight.  Remission of
symptoms, if not permanent, usually lasts 7 to 15 days. After this time, if
symptoms recur, the dose may be repeated or oral corticosteroid therapy may be
instituted.<P> <B>Horses:</B><BR><BR>  The recommended dosage is 0.01 mg to 0.02 mg
triamcinolone acetonide per pound of body weight as a single injection; the usual
range is 12 to 20 mg.<P> <B>Intralesional Dosage And Administration</B><P>
<B>Dogs and Cats:</B><BR><BR>  The usual intralesional dosage is 1.2 mg to 1.8 mg
triamcinolone  acetonide.  Injections should be circumscribed around the
lesion in various sites to insure adequate distribution of the dose.
Injections should be spaced 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm apart depending on the size of the
lesion.  The spacing of the dose also reduces pain and/or pressure necrosis.<P>
The dose injected at any one site should not exceed 0.6 mg to minimize local
tissue intolerance and atrophy, and should be made well into the cutis to
prevent subsequent rupture of the epidermis.  When treating dogs and cats with
multiple lesions, do not exceed a total dose of 6 mg.  Repeat courses of
treatment may be administered if necessary.<P>
It is preferable to employ a tuberculin syringe with a small bore needle (23-25
gauge) for accuracy of dose measurement and ease of administration.<P>
<B>Intra-Articular And Intrasynovial Dosage And Administration</B><P>
<B>Dogs, Cats and Horses:</B><BR><BR>  The dosage for intra-articular and intrasynovial
administration is dependent on the size of the joint to be treated and on the
severity of symptoms.  A single injection of 1.0 mg to 3.0 mg triamcinolone
acetonide for cats and dogs and 6.0 mg to 18.0 mg for horses is recommended.
After three or four days, injections may be repeated depending on the severity
of symptoms and the clinical response.<P>
If initial results are inadequate or too transient, dosage may be increased,
but the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded.<P>
Routine aseptic preparation of the area should be made prior to all
intra-articular injections.  The anatomy of the area to be injected should be
reviewed in order to assure that the suspension is properly placed and to
determine that large blood vessels or nerves  are  avoided.   The  inadvertent
administration  of  the corticosteroid into the soft tissues surrounding a
joint is not harmful, but is the most common cause of failure for not achieving
the desired local results.<P>
Following  intra-articular administration,  pain and other local symptoms may
continue for a short time before effective relief is obtained, but an increase
in joint discomfort is rare.  A marked increase  in  pain  accompanied  by
local  swelling,  further  restriction of joint motion, fever and malaise are
suggestive of a septic arthritis.  If these complications should occur, and the
diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, antimicrobial therapy should be instituted
immediately and continued until  all evidence of infection has disappeared.<P>
<B>IV. Effectiveness:</B><P>
The efficacy of the drug has been established by the National Academy of
Science and National Research Council (NAS/NRC) which evaluated the drug as
effective as an antiinflammatory agent. The Food and Drug Administration
concurred with the findings of The Academy which published in the Federal
Register on April 12, 1969.  Accordingly, a study was conducted by
TechAmerica Research Center (TARC), formerly known as Elars Bioresearch
Laboratories, 225 Commerce Drive, Fort Collins, CO 80524 under the
direct supervision of Dr. James Schafer, to demonstrate the comparative
bioavailability of Med-Tech's Triamcinolone Acetonide Injection to
Squibb's approved Vetalog&#174; Parenteral.<P>
The study was of a crossover design utilizing twenty healthy young
adult Beagles (ten males and ten females).  The dogs were randomly
assigned to one of two groups consisting of five males and five
females each.  Following a twelve-hour fast, dogs in Group I were
administered a single intramuscular injection of a positive control,
Squibb's Vetalog&#174; Parenteral.  Dogs in Group II received
the same dosage of Med-Tech's Triamcinolone Acetonide Injection.  The
dosage for all treatments was administered at the rate of 0.1 mg
triamcinolone acetonide per pound of body weight to the nearest 0.01
ml.  The fast continued for 12 hours post-treatment for a combined 24-hour 
fast.  Following a 5-week washout period, the procedure was repeated with 
Group I receiving the MedTech product and Group II receiving the 
Squibb material.<P>
Venous blood samples were collected at 48 hours prior to treatment,
immediately prior to treatment and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  8, 12, 16, 24, 
48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 336, 504 and 672 hours post-treatment in both periods 
of the study. (Animals were fasted for 12 hours immediately prior to each 
pre-treatment sampling.)  Samples were 
analyzed for serum glucose levels and direct eosinophil counts.<P>
The direct eosinophil counts and glucose levels monitored from 1 to 672 hours
post-treatment were analyzed using a standard splitplot ANOVA model with the
following sources of variation: Groups, Animals  (Within Groups),  Periods,
Period  by Group,  Period by Animal (Group), Time, Time by Group, Time by
Animal (Group), Time by Period, and Time by Period by Group and Time by Period
by Animal (Group).  The "Period by Group" term provided a comparison of the two
products with regards to the overall eosinophil count and mean glucose levels.
The "Time by Period by Group"  term provided a comparison of the two products
with regard to the general shape of the eosinophil and glucose curves over
time.  For eosinophil counts and glucose levels the data were log-transformed
prior to analysis,  (Eosinophil used ln(1+x) and glucose used ln(x)).<P>
When the complete range of data was used, the overall mean log eosinophil
counts for the two products were significantly different (p=0.0112) as were the
shapes of the two curves (p=0.0007). (The observed percent difference in the
overall means was 28.44%). Individual analyses were done for each sample time
and the two formulations were significantly different at 4, 16, 72, 96, 120 and
168  hours  post-treatment.   Thus  most  of  the  significant differences
occurred at time points of 72 or greater hours post-treatment, which
represented the blood depletion phase of the comparisons.<P>
When, the complete range of data was used, the mean log glucose levels  for
the  two  products were  not  significantly  different (p=0.4806); however, the
shapes of the two curves were significantly different (p=0.0003).  (The
observed percent difference for the overall means was -0.79%).  Again
individual  time analyses were done and the two formulations were significantly
different at 3, 4, 6, 12,120 and 504 hours post-treatment.<P>
In the case of the eosinophil counts the differences, although statistically
detectable, occurred primarily beyond 24 hours and were considered too small to
be biomedically important.  In the case of the glucose levels the differences
were erratic and again were considered too small to be biomedically important.
Consequently Med-Tech's product was judged medically bioequivalent to Squibb's
product.<P>
<B>V. Safety:</B><P>
The NAS/NRC review indicates that triamcinolone acetonide is safe for use at
the recommended dosages reflected on the product labeling.<P>
<B>VI. Human Safety:</B><P>
Human Food Safety:<BR><BR> As labeled, the drug poses no hazard to human safety
pertaining to drug residues, because it is labeled for use in non-food producing
animals (dogs, cats and horses).<P>
<B>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</B><BR><BR> The labeling
contains adequate caution/warning statements.<P>
<B>VII. Agency Conclusions:</B><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements
of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the regulations.
It demonstrates that triamcinolone acetonide, when used under its

Pioneer Product:  Re-Covr&#174; Injection, NADA 006-417<p>

<b>II. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA) of
1988, an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a
generic version of an approved new animal drug (pioneer product). New target
animal safety data and drug effectiveness data and human food safety data
(other than tissue residue data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.
The ANADA sponsor relies on the target animal safety and drug effectiveness and
human food safety data in the pioneer's new animal drug application.
Ordinarily the ANADA sponsor shows that the generic product is bioequivalent to
the pioneer.  A tissue residue study to establish the withdrawal time for the
generic product is also required.  For certain dosage forms, the agency will
grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR
24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline,
April 1990).<p>

Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Phoenix
Scientific, Inc. was granted a waiver from the requirements of an <i>in
vivo</i> bioequivalence study for the generic product, Tripelennamine HCl
Injection. The generic product is administered as a solution and contains the
same active and inactive ingredients in the same concentration as the pioneer
product.<p>

<b>III. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><p>

<i>Tolerance</i><p>

A tolerance has not been established for tripelennamine HCl.<p>

<i>Withdrawal Time</i><p>

When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence study is
granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product.  The withdrawal times for tripelennamine HCl injection in cattle are:
four days following the last treatment for the edible tissues and 24 hours (two
milkings) after the last treatment for milk.  Tripelennamine is not for use in
horses intended for food.<p>

<i>Regulatory Method for Residues</i><p>

An official analytical method for the detection of residues of tripelennamine
in tissues and milk has not been designated.<p>

<i>Expiry Time</i><p>

24 months.<p>

<b>IV. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>

This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug,
And Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the Act and
demonstrates that Tripelennamine Hydrochloride Injection, when used under its
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled indications.<p>

 <b>Generic Name:</b>  Tioxidazole <p> 
<b> Trade Name:  </b>  Tiox Paste <p> 
<b> Marketing Status:</b>  OTC <p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  November 9, 1987<P> 
 
 <b>2.  Indications for Use  </b> <p>
 Tiox (tioxidazole) Paste is indicated for removal of mature large
strongyles (<i>Strongylus edentatus, S.equinus </i>, and <i>S.vulgaris </i>),
 mature ascarids
(<i>Parascaris equorum</i>&#160; and immature (4th larval stage) pinworms 
(<i>Oxyuris equi </i>),
and mature small strongyles (<i>Triodontophorus spp </i>). <p> 

<b> 3.  Dosage  </b> <p>
 The recommended dosage of tioxidazole is 5 mg per pound of body weight for
one time treatment.  The Tiox Paste syringe, calibrated in 250 pound weight

</pre>
 
 Make sure the horse's mouth contains no feed.  The paste is orally
administered to horses by inserting the nozzle of the syringe through  
 the interdental space (space between front and back teeth), 
 and by depositing the required amount of paste on
the base of the tongue by depressing the plunger.  Immediately raise  
 the horse's head for a few seconds after dosing. <p> 
 
 
 <b>4.  Effectiveness</b>   <p>
 A series of critical efficacy studies were carried out at the Schering
Animal Health Research Center and at various other locations to demonstrate the
efficacy of tioxidazole in horses. <p> 

<b> Pivotal Studies</b><ul> <p>
 <li><b>a. Trial:  A-20182</b><p>
 <b> Investigator:</b><p>   Kwok L. Shun, Ph.D.<br>     
  Kenneth Guito, B.S.<p>    
  <b>Location:</b><p>   Schering Animal Health Research  Center<br>
Allentown, N.J.<p> 
<b>Type of Study:</b>  Therapeutic Equivalence<p>

 <b> Design</b><p> Twelve naturally infected horses were divided into two
 groups  of six animals each and were treated on day 0 with either Tiox
Paste or Tiox Granules.  Each product was given as a single oral dose of 11
mg/kg via stomach tube.  The critical study method was used so  that  each
animal served as its own control.  Horses were purchased from local suppliers.
Each animal was housed in an individual stall and acclimatized for a week
before treatment. <p> 
 On day -1, all animals were weighed.  Parasite egg counts were performed on
Day -1 and Day 0 using sugar flotation technique. Animals were divided into two
treatment groups based on worm egg burden. <p> 
 On Day 0, each animal received a calculated amount of Tiox granules  
 paste. The animals were observed for one hour after treatment for spillage
of drugs or any side effects due to the drug.  Fecal material was collected
daily from day  -1 to  day &#43;7.  All fecal samples were hand-picked under a
microscope for small parasites. All parasites were fixed in 10&#37; formalin and
identified. <p> 
 Animals were euthanized and necropsied 7 days after treatment,  and fecal
samples and residue worm burdens were examined.  The details of necropsy worm
recovery procedures and identification followed the description in "Guidelines
for the Efficacy Evaluation of Equine Anthelmintics." Efficacy was determined
using the critical test described in the guideline.  <p>
  
  <b>Results</b><p>
  The paste and granule forms of Tiox showed activity
against the common adult and fourth stage equine parasites  (<i>Parascaris
 equorum,  Strongylus  vulgaris, S.  edentatus,  S.  equinus,
Oxyuris equi </i>)  of 97.5&#37;-100&#37;.  Activity against the mixed mature and
immature small strongyles was 83.7&#37; for the granules and 76-5&#37; for the paste.
Tiox was not active in either paste or granule form against <i> Gastrophilus
spp </i>.   <p>
 This study demonstrated the therapeutic equivalence of the paste and
granule formulations.   Accordingly, studies performed to demonstrate the
efficacy of the NADA approved granules product (NADA 134-645, 12/26/85) may be
referenced.  These studies are discussed below. <p> 
 This study was a laboratory study and was conducted in accordance with
FDA's GLP regulations. <p>

  <b> Investigator: </b>  S. Kruckenberg, D.V.M., Ph.D.<p>
 <b>Location: </b>  Manhattan, Kansas<p>  
  <b>Type of Study: </b> Dose Confirmation <p> 
  <b> Design: </b><p>  
   In this study Tiox (tioxidazole) Paste was administered as
a single 11 mg/kg (5.0 mg/lb) oral dose to seven naturally parasitized adult
horses.  The drug was evaluated for drug side effects.  Efficacy was determined
against various species of worms. The critical study method was used to
determine efficacy as described in (a) Trial A-20182. <p> 
 <b> Results: </b><p>  Tiox (tioxidazole) Paste was 100&#37; effective in reducing
 <i>Parascaris equorum, Oxyuris equi</i>&#160;  (adult and immature),  <i>Strongylus
vulgaris, Strongylus  edentatus </i>, and small strongyles in these horses.   No
effect was seen against  <i>Gastrophilus intestinalis</i>&#160;  or  <i>Gastrophilus
hemorrhoidalis </i>.   No adverse drug reactions occurred. </ul><p>

  <b>Investigator:</b>   Eric Panitz, Ph.D.<p>  
 <b>Location:</b><p>  Schering Animal Health Research    
 Center<br>  Allentown, N.J.<p> 
 <b> Type of Study: </b> Dose Titration <p> 
 <b> Design:</b> <p> 
 Twenty-one horses were treated with tioxidazole granules at 25
(n&#61;l), 10 (8), 5 (8), or 2.5 (4) mg per kg body weight.  The drug was
administered as a top dressing on the grain.  Total fecal materials were
examined for parasites for 7-8 days after treatment. The animals were killed
7-8 days after treatment and the intestinal contents were examined for
remaining parasites.  Efficacy was determined using the critical study method
as in (a) Trial A-20182.  <p>
  <b>Results: </b><p> Treating animals with 2.5 mg tioxidazole per kg was not
 effective  against certain parasites, especially immature ascarids (0&#37;)
and large strongyles (range 20-68&#37;).   Animals treated with 5 mg per kg were
cleared of nearly all parasites (94.6&#37;) except for immature ascarids (50&#37;).
Treatment at 10 mg/kg was highly effective (96.6&#37;) against the major classes of
equine parasites (ascarids, large stongyles)  found in the infected animals.
The one animal treated with 25 mg per kg was cleared of all parasites
studied. <p>

  <b> Type of Study: </b> Dose Titration <p> 
 <b> Design:</b><p>
  Five young horses and four ponies were given tioxidazole at  10
 (n&#61;5) or 22 (n&#61;4) mg per kg body weight.  These animals had been
artificially infected with <i>P. equorum</i>&#160; ova recovered from feces from a naturally
infected horse.   The ova were embryonated in 0.05&#37; formalin at room
temperature for approximately 30 days.  Embryonated eggs in a 0.1 ml volume
were counted and used to estimate the volume required to yield 3000 embryonated
ova.   The animals were infected 43 (n&#61;4) or 43 and 60 (n&#61;l) days before
treatment.  Efficacy was  
  determined using the critical study method described in (a) Trial A-20182. <p> 
 <b> Results: </b><p> Efficacy against ascarids in animals treated with 22 mg per
 kg was  100&#37;.   Efficacy in animals without evidence of prior ascarid
infection treated at 10 mg per kg was 84.6&#37;.  Efficacy in animals with prior
infections (natural or artificial) was 0&#37; for 4th stage worms and 43.5&#37; for
immature worms. </ul><p>

 <b>Type of Study:</b>  Dose Confirmation <p> 
  
  <b>Design:</b><p>  In this study,  tioxidazole was given on the feed to six
 horses  at 11 mg/kg body weight (5 mg per pound).  Efficacy was
calculated using the critical study method as described in (a) Trial A-20182. <p> 
  <b>Results:</b><p>  Ascarids and pinworms were removed 100&#37; by
treatment.  
  Large strongyles  were also eliminated by treated  (<i>S. vulgaris </i>,
 98.0&#37;, <i>S. equinus </i>, 93.9&#37;; <i>S. edentatus </i>, 95.9&#37;). <p>

 <b>Location: </b>  Lexington, Kentucky<p>
 <b> Type of Study:</b>  Dose Confirmation  <p>
 <b>Design: </b><p> A series of 10 critical studies were conducted in naturally
parasitized young (1-2 years) horses.  Five horses were given tioxidazole at 11
mg/kg (5mg/pound) via stomach tube, while the remaining five were treated at
the same level by mixing the drug in two liters of whole oats.  Efficacy was
calculated using the critical study method described in (a) Trial A-20182. <p> 
 <b> Results:</b><p>   Efficacious removals (&#62;90&#37;) were recorded for large
strongyles, ascarids, and both mature and immature pinworms.  Feed
administration tended to be more effective than tubing for <i>S.  edentatus</i>&#160;
 (range 94-100&#37; vs 71-99&#37;).  The reverse was true for  <i>S.  vulgaris</i>&#160;
 (range 42-100&#37; for feeding vs 100&#37; for tubing). <p>

   Center<br>  Allentown, N.J.<p> 
  <b>Type of Study: </b>  Compatibility <p> 
  <b> Design: </b><p> Twenty horses were allotted to five groups of four animals
each.  Group A animals received no treatment.  All animals in Groups B-E
received tioxidazole at 11 mg/kg body weight (5 mg/pound) by stomach tube.
Animals in groups B-E were also given a boticide, either carbon disulfide (CS2;
28 ml per horse), piperazine carbodithoic acid (Parvex, 88 mg/kg),  trichlorfon
(Combot, 40 mg/kg), or dichlorvus (Equigel,10 mg/kg), respectively.  Fecal egg
counts were taken at treatment and seven days after treatment.  The animals
were necropsied seven days after treatment and examined for residual worm
burdens.  Efficacy was evaluated by comparing aggregate residual instars and
worm burdens of treated groups to controls for percent reduction.  Egg count
 data  were also evaluated for reductions of ascarid ova per gram and
strongyle ova per gram. <p> 
  <b> Results:</b><p>  Tioxidazole efficacy was greater than 99.9&#37; when horses
were also treated with carbon disulfide, piperazine carbodithoic acid,
trichlorfon, or dichlorvos (critical study method).  Ascarid egg counts were
reduced 100&#37;, and strongyle egg counts were reduced 97.6&#37; or more. <p> 
 The efficacy of tioxidazole has  been  demonstrated in previous work
(a-j).  This efficacy was not increased, decreased or adversely affected when
tioxidazole was given in combination with each of the four boticides. <p> 
 Carbon disulfide (89&#37;), trichlorfon (93&#37;), and dichlorvos (90&#37; except 47&#37;
vs 3rd instar  <i>G. intestinalis </i>)  were not adversely affected by
tioxidazole in treatment of bots.  Piperazine carbodithoic acid efficacy
against  <i>G. intestinalis</i>&#160;  was lower (2nd stage 51.2&#37;; 3rd stage 27.3&#37;) than
has been reported by other investigators. </uL> <p>
 
 
 In addition to the ten critical studies listed above,  two non-critical
efficacy studies were conducted, and the results are shown below: <ul><p> 
 
<li><b> l. Trial:  A-13127</b><p> 
<b>Investigators: </b> E. Panitz, Ph.D. and K. Shum, Ph.D.<p>

Center<br>  Allentown, N.J.<p>
 <b>Type  of Study: </b>  Dose Titration <p> 
<b> Design:</b> <p>Fourteen foals age 1-2 months were infected with approximately
5,000 embryonated ova of <i> P. equorum </i>.    The animals were allotted to one
of five groups: 
Group A was untreated control; 
Group B, 11   
 mg tioxidazole per kg 43 days after infection (A.I.); Group C, 22 mg per  
 kg 43 days A.I.; Group D, 111 mg/kg 58 days A.I.; Group E, 22 mg/kg 58 days
A.I.   There were three animals in Groups A and C-D and two animals in Group B.
Two to four weeks later, the animals were  
 all treated with trichlorfon (Combot, 40 mg/kg) and thiabendazole
(Thibenzole, 40 mg/kg).  Total fecal materials were examined for worms for
seven days following dual treatment  
 (trichlorfon   and thiabendazole).  Geometric mean ascarid worm compared
between each tioxidazole treatment group and  
 the control group. <p> 
 <b> Results: </b> <p> Worms recovered from each group were as follows: A, 143.0;
B,  118.2; C, 244.9; D, 4.4; E,  18.6.   Percent reduction was then 17.0&#37;, 0&#37;,
97.0&#37;, and 86.9&#37; for groups B-E, respectively. <p>

 <b>Investigator: </b>  Doyne Hamm, D.V.M.<p> 
 <b> Location: </b> Fayetteville, Arkansas<p>  
  <b>Type of Study:</b>  Treatment Interval <p> 
  <b>Design:  </b>  <p>Sixty mares were divided into four groups of 15 and
treated at the following times: 1) one month intervals for six months with
tioxidazole; 2) two month intervals for six months with tioxidazole; 3) an
initial three week interval then three month intervals for six months with
tioxidazole; and 4) two month intervals for six months with mebendazole
(Telmin) the positive control drug.  Tioxidazole treatment was 11 mg/kg body
weight (5 mg/pound).   Mebendazole treatment was approximately 10 mg/pound body
weight.  Fecal samples were obtained prior to the first deworming, two weeks
after the first deworming, and immediately prior to each subsequent deworming.
Egg counts were conducted according to McMasters technique by Dr. Thomas
Yazwinski, University of Arkansas. <p> 
 <b> Results: </b> <p> Strongyle egg counts prior to treatment were above 2200 in
all groups (total eggs per 15 grams - 1 gram per horse) with all horses showing
some eggs.  Ascarid egg counts varied widely (0-15 per horse).  Following the
first tioxidazole treatment, strongyle egg counts ranged from 7 (Group 1) to 61
(Group 3) for tioxidazole and were 218 for mebendazole, the positive control
drug.  Subsequent egg counts for group 1 ranged from 5 to 116; for group 2 from
423 to 986; for group 3 from 2701 to 2724, and for group 4 from 1376 to
1470.  <p>

<b> Location: </b>  Lexington, Kentucky<p>    
<b> Type of Study:</b>  Controlled study versus benzimidazole-resistant strongyles <p> 

 <b>Design:</b><p> Thirty mares were used in a non-critical field test to determine
the equivalence of strongyle activity of granule and paste formulations of
tioxidazole at 11 mg/kg.  The mares were separated into 3 groups of 10 each.
Group I received the paste formulation orally, Group II was fed the granule
formulation on the grain ration, and Group III was non-treated. <p> 
 <b> Results: </b><p> The paste treated group had reductions of 87&#37; for a
 strongyle  eggs and 86&#37; for small strongyle larvae.  Large strongyle
larvae were not present in cultures before or after treatment.  The group
treated with granules had 61&#37; reduction in strongyle eggs. Small strongyle
larvae were reduced 16&#37; while large strongyle larvae were reduced 90-100&#37;.   In
this study,  the performance of the paste formulation of tioxidazole exceeded
that of the granules. </ul><p> 

The studies previously described, both critical and non-critical were
laboratory studies.  Controlled clinical studies were also conducted with
tioxidazole.  Summaries of these studies are presented below:<p>

 <li><b>q. Trial:  V82-001-04</b><p>  <b>Investigator:</b>   DeWitt  Owen  Jr., D.V.M.<br>
<b>Location:</b>   Franklin, Tennessee<br><b> Number of Animals:</b>  62 <p> 
 
<b> Design: </b><p>Trials o through q were all conducted using the same protocol.  A
 total of 163 horses with pretreatment fecal egg counts, representative of
common breeds, well distributed as to sex and age and managed in accordance
with methods common to the United States, were used in these trials.
Pretreatment and post-treatment fecal egg counts were evaluated as a measure of
efficacy of Tiox Paste.  Clinical observations were made to assess
acceptability and safety of the drug under clinical use conditions. <br>
  <b>Results: </b><p>  Horses treated with Tiox Paste had either no fecal eggs
observed or reduced fecal egg counts  as  compared to pretreatment values.
There were no reports of advese effects, difficulty in administration or
acceptability of the drug. </ul><p> 
 
 
 <b>5.   Safety </b>  <p>
 A series of studies were conducted to demonstrate the safety of treatment
of horses with tioxidazole.  Two studies were conducted to examine drug
tolerance (Section III; studies s and v) and three were conducted for toxicity
(Section IV; studies r, t, and u). <p> 
 The two drug tolerance studies were conducted using multiples of the
recommended dose, based upon the actual body weights of the test animals.  In
each of these two studies, horses received up to 40X (study s) or 25X (study v)
the recommended dose without drug-related adverse effects. <p> 
 The marketed product will be packaged to treat up to 1250 pounds (568 kg)
of body weight in 250 pound increments, and under field conditions  
 expected that the acutal dose given will correspond to the higher of the
two possible doses where the body weight falls between any two of the 250 pound
increments.  Thus an 800 pound (364 kg) animal will be dosed as if it weighed
1000 pounds (454 kg) rather than 750 pounds (341 kg).  For that reason, the
three toxicity studies were conducted using a value of 1000 pounds (454 kg) for
calculating doses to be administered. <p> 
 In two of the toxicity studies, repeated (3 days) administration of 3X
(study t) or 5X (Study u) the recommended dose produced no treatment-related
changes in any of the parameters investigated.  The third toxicity study using
a single 5X (study r) dose also produced no treatment-related changes in any of
the parameters measured. <p> 
 All animals in study t weighed between 500 pound (227 kg) and 1100 pounds
(500 kg), while all animals in study u weighed 726-968 pounds (330-440 kg).
Most animals thus received somewhat more tioxidazole than if the doses had been
calculated based upon actual body weight. The studies were therefore more rigid
tests of the toxicity of tioxidazole than is evident from the summary of
results. <p> 
 All five studies were laboratory studies.   Studies r, s, u, and v were
conducted according the FDA's GLP regulations.  Study t was conducted prior to
the june 20, 1979, effective date for the GLP regulations. Although study t
accordingly could not have been conducted in compliance with those regulations,
study t was conducted in a scientifically sound appropriate manner. <uL><p>

     <b>Type of Study: </b> Oral Safety <p> 
 <b> Design: </b><p>  Four adult horses (two mares and two geldings) were
administered 5X the recommended dose of tioxidazole (12.5 g tioxidazole per 500
pounds body weight) as the paste formulation. Four control horses (two mares
and two geldings) received an equivalent amount of vehicle alone.  All
treatments were  
 administered once orally, directly into the mouth.  A BSP liver function
test was performed and blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected on days
-1, 0 (immediately prior to treatment), &#43;1, and &#43;7.   No animals died or
displayed symptoms of overt toxicology during the study.   Thus no gross
necropsies or histopathological evaluations were performed. <p> 
  <b>Results: </b><p>   There were no treatment-related effects seen on any of
the  parameters  investigated.   The margin of safety in this study is
thus at least five times the recommended dose. <p>

  <b>Type of Study: </b> Acute Toxicity <p> 
 <b> Design: </b><p>   One mare and one gelding were given tioxidazole by stomach
 tube  each day for three days.   On day 1 the animals received 110 mg per
kg body weight (10X recommended level), on day 2 each were given 220 mg/kg
(20X), and on day 3 each received 440 mg/kg (40X).  Animals were individually
weighed prior to the start of the study, with doses calculated based upon that
weight. Horses were observed each day following the three treatments and for
two weeks after the last treatment for signs of clinical toxicity.   Horses
were then euthanized for gross necropsy and histopathology. <p> 
  <b>Results:</b><p>   There were no changes in clinical parameters in either
 animal.   Gross necropsy results and histopathological findings revealed
no treatment-related effects.   The margin of safety in this study is thus at
least 40 times the recommended dose. <p>

Center<br>
 Allentown, N.J.<p> 
 <b>Type of Study:</b>  Oral Toxicity <p> 
 <b> Design:</b><p>   Fourteen mares were allocated to four treatment groups.
Animals were "taped" using a standard horse tape to confirm that they weighed
between 500 and 1100 pounds (227-500 kg).  Doses were calculated based upon a
standard body weight of 1000 pounds (454 kg). Treatments were given mixed in
the grain ration. <p> 
 Group A horses (n&#61;5) received approximately 33 mg tioxidazole per kg body
weight (3X recommended dose) for 3 consecutive days.  Group B consisted of two
animals sampled at the same time as Group A and serving as untreated controls.
Group C (n&#61;5) animals received approximately 11 mg/kg body weight in a single
oral treatment.  Group D consisted of two animals sampled at the same time as
Group C and serving as untreated controls.  Serum, plasma, urine, and fecal
samples were collected for analysis, and a BSP liver function test was
performed.  Groups A &#38; B were sampled on days -1, 0 (immediately prior to
treatment), &#43;1, &#43;3, and &#43;9.   Groups C &#38; D were sampled on days -1, 0, &#43;1,
and &#43;7. <p>
  <b>Results:</b><p>   Neither dose level of tioxidazole produced any
appreciable, consistent changes in the physiological parameters measured.  The
margin of safety in this study is thus at least three times the recommended
dose, even when given every day for three consecutive days. <p>

  Allentown, N.J.<p>
   <b>Type of Study:</b>  Oral Toxicity <p> 
 <b> Design: </b><p>  Six horses (3 mares, 3 geldings) were administered
approximately 55 mg tioxidazole per kg body weight (5X recommended dose) via
stomach tube once a day for three days.  Animals were individually weighed
prior to treatment (range 726-968 pounds or 330-440 kg).  Doses were calculated
based upon a standard body weight of 1000 pounds (454 kg).  One mare and one
gelding served as sham-treated controls.  A BSP liver function test was
performed and serum, plasma, urine, and fecal samples were collected on days
-1, 0 (immediately prior to treatment), &#43;1, &#43;3, and &#43;9.  All horses were
euthanized after the last sample for gross necropsy and histological
evaluation. <p> 
  <b>Results:</b><p>   There were no treatment-related effects seen on any
of  the  parameters investigated.  The margin of safety in this study
is thus at least 5 times the recommended dose when given for 3 times 
 the recommended  treatment  period.     <p>

 <b>Investigator: </b>  Ruta M. Slepetys, B.S.<p> 
 <b> Location: </b><p> Schering Animal Health Research Center<br>
  Allentown, N.J.<p> 
  <b>Type of Study: </b> Oral Toxicity <p> 
 <b>Design:</b><p>  Six horses (3 mares, 3 geldings) were weighed and doses calculated
based upon actual body weights.  Animals were administered approximately 275 mg
tioxidazole per kg body weight (25X recommended dose) once orally via mixing in
the feed.  All medicated feed was consumed as readily as unmedicated feed.
Three mares and two geldings served as controls.  A  BSP  liver function
test was performed and serum, plasma, urine, and fatal samples were collected
on days -1, 0 (immediately prior to treatment), &#43;1, &#43;2, &#43;3, &#43;7, &#43;9, and
&#43;14.     
 No animals died or displayed symptoms of overt toxicity.  Thus, no gross
necropsies or subsequent histopathological evaluations were performed. <p> 
 <b> Results: </b><p>  Changes in the parameters investigated were limited to
isolated occurrences in treated animals that were not readily attributable to
treatment, i.e. weight loss in one animal and increased SGOT in another.  Other
changes, i.e. elevated band cell number, increased BSP clearance times and
fecal occult blood occurred with equal frequency in controls and were also
noted prior to treatment. There were no other biologically significant changes,
but no necropsies or histopathology was done.</ul> <p>
 
  <b>6.  Human Safety </b>  <p>
 Data on human safety pertaining to human consumption of drug residues in
food were not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved for use
only in horses that are not to be used for food and is to be labeled:  NOT FOR
USE IN HORSES INTENDED FOR FOOD.  With respect to human safety relating to
possession, handling, and administration, no special caution statement is
needed. <p> 
 <b>7.  Agency Conclusions </b>  <p>
 The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
Those data demonstrate that Tiox (tioxidazole) Paste, when used under its
labeled conditions of use, is safe and effective. <p> 
 Tiox (tioxidazole) Paste is approved for OTC use because the product has
been shown to be effective against all important parasites detrimental to the
health of the horse  (<i>Strongylus edentatus,  S.  equinus,  S.
 vulgaris, Parascaris  equorum,  Oxyuris equi</i>&#160;  and  <i>Triodontophorus
 spp. </i>).  Directions for oral administration of Tiox (tioxidazole) Paste can
reasonably be followed by the laymen. <p>

<b>	2.	INDICATIONS </b>
  <P>
Fertagyl &#174;  is indicated for the treatment of ovarian follicular
cysts in dairy cattle.  Ovarian cysts are non-ovulated follicles with
incomplete luteinization which result in nymphomania or irregular estrus.<P>Historically, cystic ovaries have responded to an exogenous source of
luteinizing hormone (LH) such as human chorionic gonadotropin.
Fertagyl &#174;  initiates release of endogenous LH to cause ovulation
and luteinization. <P>

 <b> 	3.	DOSAGE	</b><P>CATTLE <P>
The recommended intramuscular or intravenous dosage of
Fertagyl &#174;  is 2 mL/cow, containing 86 mcg gonadorelin
(equivalent to 100 mcg gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate).
 	 <P>
<b>	4.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY and DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,
drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue
data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<P>Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Intervet
Inc. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence
study for gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate.  The generic and pioneer products
contain the same active and inactive ingredients and are parenteral solutions.
<P>	<b>5.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P><i>Tolerance</i><P>A tolerance has not been established for gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate.<P><i>Withdrawal Time</i><P>
When a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing is granted, the withdrawal
times are those previously assigned to the pioneer product.  A zero withdrawal
is applied to gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate.<P><i>Regulatory Method for Residues</i><P>Since gonadorelin is approved with a zero withdrawal, an official analytic
method is not needed.   <P>
<b>	6.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b> <P>
	 
		This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and

<B>MARKETING STATUS:</B> 
Monteban&#174;, 3-Nitro&#174; and BMD&#174; are OTC products.<p>
<B>DATE OF SUMMARY:</B> July 5, 1989<p>
<B>II. Indications for Use:</B><p>
For the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <I>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E.
maxima, E. mivati, E. necatrix,</I> and <I>E. tennela;</I>&#160;for increased rate of weight
gain and improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<p>
<B>III. DOSAGE FORM</B><p>
Narasin, roxarsone and bacitracin methylene disalicylate are
marketed as separate Type A articles.  For oral administration via the feed for
growing broiler chickens.<p>
<B>Recommended Dosage:</B><p> 
 Narasin: 
 54 - 72 grams/ton<BR>
 Roxarsone: 
 22.7 - 45.4 grams/ton<BR>
 Bacitracin methylene disalicylate: 
 10 - 50 grams/ton.<p> 
For broiler chickens only. Feed continuously as sole ration. Withdraw 5
days before slaughter. Do not feed to laying hens. Use as sole source of
organic arsenic. Drug overdose or lack of water may result in leg weakness.
Do not allow adult turkeys, horses, or other equines access to feed containing
narasin. Ingestion of narasin by these species has been fatal.<p>
<B>IV. Effectiveness:</B><p>
<B>Non-Interference Study</B><p>
A series of seven well controlled battery studies, using approved protocols and
Hubbard white mountain broiler cockerels eight days of age raised under
environmentally controlled conditions, was conducted to assure the non-interference 
of BMD and roxarsone on the anticoccidial efficacy of narasin.
The chickens were challenged with six species of <I>Eimeria</I>&#160;as individual
infections and as a mixed infection of all six species. The studies were
conducted at Lilly Research Laboratories, PO Box 708, Greenfield, IN 46140.
Data from the mixed infection study are provided in this summary.<p>

Each of 6 treatments (Table I) was replicated 4 times using 4 birds per
replicate in 8 day old chicks in a coccidia free environment prior to the
initiation of the experiment. Water and medicated feed were supplied ad
libitum, proper ambient temperature and constant lighting schedules were
maintained during the experiment.<p>
A typical medicated broiler starter ration was provided for two days prior to
the coccidial exposure and fed thereafter. Rations were assayed for BMD,
roxarsone and narasin.<p>
Forty-eight hours after initiation of medicated feeding the birds were
inoculated with a mixed infective culture of <I>E. tenella, E. necatrix, E.
acervulina, E. maxima, E. mivati</I>&#160;and <I>E. brunetti</I>. Inoculum was intended to
produce clinical coccidiosis in the infected non-medicated birds. The
treatment regimen is set out below (Table I).<p>
In six experiments inoculation was by single species challenge, i.e., one
experiment for each of the six species of <I>Eimeria</I>&#160;approved for narasin. In the
seventh experiment all six species were combined as the mixed inoculum.<p>

6. Narasin &#43; BMD &#43; Roxarsone (60&#43; 110 &#43; 50 ppm)<p>
Observations, measured by mortality, weight gain, feed conversion and lesion
scores were conducted for 7 days post inoculum.<p>
The data from these experiments are succinctly depicted in Tables II through
Table VIII. The data show that neither the proposed level of BMD nor the proposed
level of BMD &#43; roxarsone interfered with the anticoccidial activity of the
lowest approved level of narasin (54 grams/ton or 60 ppm).<p>

These results show that narasin, both alone and in combination with roxarsone,
effectively reduced lesion scores. The addition of BMD to feeds had no adverse
effect on the ability of narasin or narasin &#43; roxarsone to control coccidial
infection. Thus BMD was found to be compatible with narasin or narasin &#43;
roxarsone when the drugs are fed to growing birds.<p>
<B>Floor Pen Trials</B><p>
Six floor pen experiments were conducted using approved protocols and 10040
birds. BMD was used at 0 or 50 grams per ton of feed in combination with
roxarsone at 0 or 45.4 grams per ton to provide the possible combinations of
these two drugs. The anticoccidial narasin, at 72.5 grams per ton, was
included in all treatments. The experiments were designed to confirm the
effects of BMD and roxarsone in combination with narasin on body weight gain
and feed efficiency.<p>

This 46 day trial was conducted in a conventional type dirt floor broiler house
on the premises of 3T Research, Hamilton, TX during the period August 31 till
October 17, 1980. The 28 pens in this trial are arranged in two rows with a
center aisle. Each 5' x 10' pen is identically equipped with a cylindrical hanging
self feeder, a Plasson automatic waterer and a thermostatically controlled gas
brooder. Natural light is supplemented with electric bulbs down the center
aisle. Built up litter was top dressed with new shavings after removal of wet
spots. 30 males and 30 female birds per pen.<p>
One thousand six hundred and eighty (1680) day old sexed chicks were randomly
assigned into 28 experimental pens. Treatments were assigned to pens in a
randomized block design. The 28 pens allowed for seven replications of the
four treatments.<p>
The experiment consisted of four dietary treatments: narasin at 72.5 grams per ton;

This 2800 bird experiment was conducted in a conventional-type, dirt floor
broiler house (Random Sample Broiler House 2) on the Texas A&#38;M University
Poultry Center. Vaccinated, day-old, sexed Hubbard x Hubbard broiler chicks
were distributed randomly by sex into 28 pens so that each pen contained 50
males and 50 females, allowing 0.8 square foot of floor space per bird. Chicks
that died during the first week were replaced with hatch mates. All mortality
was recorded by date and pen after the initial replacement period.<p>
Experimental diets were prepared by mixing the appropriate amount of each drug
premix supplied by the sponsor with commercial-type starter and nutrient
recommendations. Feed samples were assayed for drug content.<p>
The 28 pens permitted 7 replications (pens) of the following 4 dietary
treatments: narasin 72.5 grams per ton; narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; roxarsone 45.
4 grams per ton; narasin
72.5 grams per ton &#43; BMD 50 grams per ton; and narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43;
roxarsone 45.4 g/t + BMD 50 grams per ton.
Birds were on medicated feed for 46 days.<p>
Results: A combination of narasin, BMD and roxarsone increased rate of gain
significantly over birds fed narasin alone. Broilers receiving narasin &#43; BMD
or narasin &#43; roxarsone were intermediate in weight at 46 days of age - heavier
than birds receiving narasin alone but not as heavy as those receiving narasin
&#43; BMD &#43; roxarsone combination.<p>
Livability was not affected.<p>

The 1200 experimental birds were housed in a conventional insulated, curtain-sided 
broiler house with wire partitions and dirt floor. Each 5' x 8' pen was
identically equipped with an automatic water fountain, a cylindrical hanging
self feeder and a heat lamp brooder. All feeders in each row are suspended
from a common shaft so that all are raised and lowered together. Light to
supplement natural daylight was supplied by a 25 watt bulb over the center of
each pen. Built up litter was stirred and top dressed with new wood shavings
after removal of caked or wet spots.<p>
Day-old Arbor Acre x Peterson chicks were distributed randomly by sex into 24
pens so that each pen contained 25 male and 25 female chicks, with six
replicates. For assignment of treatments to pens, the 24 pens were divided
into blocks and dietary treatments assigned randomly within each block. Chicks
that died during the first week were replaced with chicks from the same hatch.
After the first week, all mortality was recorded by date and pen.<p>
Experimental diets were prepared by blending the appropriate amount of the
respective drug premixes supplied by the sponsor with commercial type starter
and grower basal ration formulated to meet or exceed all NRC nutrient
recommendations. The experiment entailed four dietary treatments: narasin 72.5
grams per ton; narasin 72.5 grams per ton + roxarsone 45.4 grams per ton;
 narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; BMD 50 grams per ton;
narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; roxarsone 45.4 grams per ton &#43; BMD 50 
grams per ton. The experiment ran for 48
days.<p>
Results: Narasin &#43; BMD and narasin &#43; BMD &#43; roxarsone showed superior rate of
gain over narasin alone or narasin + roxarsone.<p>
Both narasin &#43; BMD and narasin &#43; BMD &#43; roxarsone showed improved feed

The 1440 experimental birds were housed in a conventional steel-truss building
with insulated roof and sidewalls with a three-foot curtain. Pens are 7' x 8' and
contained two hanging tube-type feeders, an automatic water fount and an
infrared gas brooder. Plastic feeder flats and water founts were used during
the first seven days for supplemental feeding and water. Wood shavings litter,
used in a previous grow out, was stirred lightly and top dressed with new
litter. Day-old, sexed broiler chicks obtained from a commercial hatchery were
randomly distributed by sex into the pens so that each pen contained 30 males
and 30 females. Male chicks had the toe web clipped for identification. Chicks
that died during the first week were replaced with hatch mates.<p>
Brooding temperatures began at 85&#176;F with whole-house brooding with 5&#176; 
per week reductions to a minimum of 65 degrees. Automatic fans and
sidewall curtains were used to aid in maintaining temperature control.<p>
The 24 pens allotted to this study permitted 6 replications of each of the
4 dietary treatments as follows: narasin 72.5 grams per ton; narasin
72.5 grams per ton &#43; BMD 50 grams per ton; narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; 
roxarsone 45.4 grams per ton; narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; roxarsone 45.4

The 1120 bird, 49 day experiment was conducted in a conventional broiler
house, Four Towers Research Center, University of Georgia from May 3, 1985 to
June 21, 1985. Twenty-eight pens each containing 20 male and 20 female day-old
Arbor Acre x Peterson chicks were allocated for this study. All pens were
equipped with automatic circular bell-type waterers, a circular feeder and an
electric heat bulb for brooding. Each pen received approximately 2 inches of
new litter and top dressing was applied as necessary using new pine shavings.
Medicated feeds were prepared as per standard industry practice. Finished
feeds were assayed for drug content.<p>
7 pens were assigned to each treatment group as follows: narasin 72.5 grams per ton;
narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; roxarsone 45.4 grams per ton; narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; BMD 50 grams per ton; narasin
72.5 grams per ton &#43; roxarsone 45.4 grams per ton &#43; BMD 50 grams per ton.<p>
It should be noted that this trial was conducted during a period of excessively
high temperatures. On several days, the temperature was in excess of 95&#176;F;
 and in at least one instance, the temperature exceeded 100&#176;F. 
The overall high livability and bird response is evidenced of good
management practices in this experiment.<p>
Results: The combination of both narasin &#43; BMD and narasin &#43; roxarsone &#43; BMD
were superior in increased rate of weight gain and in feed conversion as
compared to narasin alone and narasin &#43; roxarsone.<p>
Results are tabulated in full later in this summary.<p>
<B>Summary of Floor Pen Studies</B><p>
The six described floor-pen studies, using approved protocols and 10,040
broiler chickens (equal numbers of male and females) were conducted under
conditions simulating actual field use to determine the growth promoting
effects of BMD and roxarsone in combination with narasin. The studies were
conducted in five different geographical locations.<p>
Consistent with pen size and allowing 0.8 to 0.9 square feet per bird, 20 to 50
birds of each sex were selected at random and assigned to pens. Six to nine
replicates were used per treatment group. BMD at 0 and 50 grams per ton of feed was used
in combination with roxarsone at 0 or 45.4 grams per ton of feed to provide the possible
combinations of these drugs. Narasin 72.5 grams per ton of feed was used in all feed in
each study.<p>
The studies were designed and conducted to simulate varying conditions as
climate, geographical location, weather, management practices, and degree of
disease contamination of the premises. Feed consumption was corrected for
mortality by estimating feed consumed from standard tables based on age of each
bird when it died in each pen and subtracting that amount from the total feed
consumed by that pen.<p>
A detailed statistical evaluation of the six studies was conducted by Dr.
Charles Gates, Statistics Institute, Texas A&#38;M University. The data were
combined over the trials and analyzed using SAS's GLM Procedures&#42;. Bacitracin
methylene disalicylate at the 50 grams per ton level showed a significant effect as
compared to narasin control for both feed efficiency and increased rate of
weight gain. Roxarsone plus narasin was significantly superior to narasin alone
for feed efficiency but not for body weight. Narasin plus roxarsone plus
bacitracin methylene disalicylate was significantly superior to BMD plus
narasin for increased rate of weight gain but not feed efficiency.<p>
The results of specific treatment comparisons of data from the floor pen
studies qualify this application for range approval for the three drug
combination under CVM's drug combination policy revised October 1983. The data
demonstrates that all three drugs contributed significantly to the
effectiveness of the combination drug. These data permit CVM to grant approval
for this application for the dosage levels and indications for use described in
section two (II) of this document.<p>

<B>V. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><p>
The basic animal safety data for bacitracin MD may be found in the parent NADA
46-592 sponsored by A.L. Laboratories, (approved March 15, 1976, 41 FR 10993);
for narasin the data may be found in the parent NADA 118-980 sponsored by
Elanco Products Co., (approved August 14, 1986, 51 FR 29098); for roxarsone the
data may be found in the parent NADA 7-891, sponsored by Salsbury Laboratories
(approved March 23, 1951). The efficacy studies shown in Section IV demonstrate
that no adverse effects were observed when the drugs were combined, indicating
that the drugs are as safe when fed in combination as when fed alone.<p>
This application is in accord with the Animal Safety Guidelines. Additional
safety studies were not required because: (1) The drugs have been approved
singly and (2) adequate documentation has been provided to show that these
compounds are compatible in combination when used in broiler chicken feeds.
Therefore, based on the data in the original NADAs, the non-interference study,
the floor-pen efficacy studies and the tissue residue depletion study, it is
concluded that this combination of drugs may be safely fed to broiler
chickens.<p>

<B>VI. Human Safety:</B><p>
<B>A. Toxicity Tests:</B><p>
The data in the parent NADAs have demonstrated that these three drug products
do not constitute a hazard to human health when used according to approved
labeling. The basic safety data for bacitracin methylene disalicylate may be
found in the parent NADA 46-592 sponsored by A. L. Laboratories, (approved
March 15, 1976, 41 FR 10993); for narasin the data may be found in the parent
NADA 118-980 sponsored by Elanco Products Co. (approved August 14, 1986, 51 FR
29098); for roxarsone the data may be found in the parent NADA 7-891, sponsored
by Salsbury Laboratories (approved March 23, 1951).<p>
<B>B. Tolerances &#38; Safe Concentration of Residues</B><p>
The tolerance for residues of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD) in
uncooked tissues of chickens is established at 0.5 ppm negligible residue (21
CFR 556.70). Tolerances for residues of arsenic in edible tissues of chickens
are established at 0.5 ppm in muscle and 2.0 ppm in edible by-products, (21 CFR
556.60). A tolerance for narasin residues in chickens is not needed, (21 CFR
556.428).<p>
The safe concentrations for total narasin residues in uncooked edible tissues
are: 0.6 ppm in muscle; 1.8 ppm in liver; 1.2 ppm in skin with adhering fat and
fat. A tolerance refers to the concentration of marker residues in the target
tissue used to monitor for total drug residues in the target animals. A safe
concentration refers to the total residue concentration considered safe in
edible tissues.<p>
<B>C. Tissue Residue Depletion Studies</B><p>
A tissue residue study was conducted to demonstrate that there is no change in
the residue depletion pattern of each drug when narasin, roxarsone and
bacitracin methylene disalicylate were fed to broiler chickens in a three way
combination. There were two segments to the study: (1) validation of the assay
by assaying spiked tissue samples with the cited drugs, (2) assay for narasin,
bacitracin methylene disalicylate and roxarsone were conducted on tissue
samples harvested from medicated birds raised as in commercial production.
Investigators: Dr. John A. Hebert, Louisiana State University; Randall A. Primo,
Ponderosa Research Co., French Village, MO. Monitor: Dr. Ralph V. Fell, Director
of Technical Services, A.L. Laboratories, Inc.<p>
In two studies commercial broiler chicks 2-3 weeks of age equally
divided as to sex were fed up to 7 weeks of age on diets containing (1)
narasin 80 and 90 grams per ton, roxarsone 45.4 grams per ton, bacitracin methylene disalicylate
100 and 200 grams per ton, (2) unmedicated basal ration.<p>
Tissues were collected from groups of 3M and 3F birds as follows:<p><DL>
<DT>For narasin assay:
<DD>fat samples at 0, 1 and 2 days withdrawal.<p>
<DT>For roxarsone assay:    
<DD>liver, kidney, muscle and skin/fat at 0, 4 and 5 days withdrawal.<p>
<DT>For bacitracin methylene disalicylate assay:
<DD>muscle tissue at 0 and 2 days withdrawal.<p></DL>

Samples were labelled, quick frozen and shipped on dry ice to the respective
laboratories for assay together with spiked control tissues for method
validation.<p>
A summary of the tissue residue depletion studies are shown in Table I. These
data confirm that each drug in the presence of the others does not exceed its
approved safe concentration or tolerance. Therefore, these data support a five
day withdrawal period for the use of this three way combination in broilers
under CVM's combination drug policy.<p>
<B>D. Tissue Residue Non-Interference Studies</B><p>
<B>1. Bacitracin Methylene Disalicylate Assay</B><p>
Tissue assay non-interference and method validation studies for bacitracin
methylene disalicylate tissue assay were conducted by spiking control samples
with bacitracin methylene disalicylate, roxarsone and narasin and then assaying
for bacitracin methylene disalicylate residues. The assay results demonstrated
no interference by narasin and roxarsone for bacitracin methylene disalicylate.
(AL-TR-1-82).<p>
<B>2. Narasin Assay</B><p>
A non-interference study, AAC-8855, for narasin was conducted by spiking
control tissue samples with narasin, roxarsone and bacitracin methylene
disalicylate and then assaying these tissues for narasin content. The results
demonstrated no interference by bacitracin methylene disalicylate or roxarsone
for narasin.<p>
<B>3. Roxarsone Assay</B><p>
Assay non-interference data were not required for roxarsone due to the
procedure for arsenic analysis.<p>

<B>VII. Agency Conclusions:</B><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and demonstrate that narasin (54-72 g/ton) plus roxarsone (22.7
-45.4 g/ton) plus bacitracin methylene disalicylate (10-50 g/ton) are safe and
effective for the claims indicated in Section II of this FOI Summary.<p>
This original NADA is regarded as a Category II application under CVM's
supplemental policy, (42 FR 64367; December 23, 1977), which did not require
reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent NADAs. The drugs are to
be fed in Type C medicated feeds, in accordance with Section II and III of this
FOI Summary and the Blue Bird labeling that is attached to this document.<p>
Residue depletion studies in this application demonstrate that residues of
narasin at 0-day withdrawal will be below the safe concentration of 1.2 ppm
in skin with adhering fat. The reported 0.048 ppm level of parent narasin in
skin with adhering fat is well below its established safe concentration of 1.2
ppm in skin with adhering fat and is not appreciably different from the
previously reported values for narasin alone.<p>
Residues of bacitracin MD in edible tissues are below the tolerance of 0.5 ppm,
established in 21 CFR 556.70. Residues of arsenic (from roxarsone) in edible
tissues are below the tolerances of 2 ppm in uncooked edible by-products (by-products 
include liver) and 0.5 ppm in uncooked muscle tissue (21 CFR 556.60).
Adequate information was submitted to demonstrate non-interference between the
assays for each drug. The approval of this application will not significantly
increase human exposure to drug residues.<p>
Noninterference studies demonstrate that narasin in the presence of roxarsone
and/or bacitracin MD prevented an outbreak of coccidiosis when the birds were
exposed to the six major species of <I>Eimeria</I>. The data from six well-controlled
floor pen studies demonstrate the effectiveness of bacitracin plus roxarsone
for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in broiler
chickens in the presence of narasin. The policy outlined provides for the
granting of range approval for narasin (54-72 g/ton) for the prevention of
coccidiosis caused by <I>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati, E.
necatrix</I>&#160;and <I>E. tenella;</I> for bacitracin MD (10 to 50 g/ton) and for roxarsone
(22.7 to 45.4 g/ton) for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed
efficiency in broiler chickens.<p>

<b>m.  Date of Summary:</b> March 4, 1994<p>
<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a genetic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
genetic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of genetic salinomycin in combination with roxarsone and BMD.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR &#167;   558.550.  Bacitracin methylene disalicylate is codified
under 21 CFR &#167;  558.76. Roxarsone (3-Nitro) is codified under 21 CFR
&#167;  558.530. The combination of salinomycin sodium, bacitracin
methylene disalicylate and roxarsone is codified under 21 CFR &#167;
 558.550(a)  and (b)(1)(iv).<p>
<b>3.    HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this genetic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<p>
<b>a.    Tolerances/Safe Concentrations for Residues</b><p>
The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<p>
Tolerances for residues of bacitracin from bacitracin methylene disalicylate
are established at 0.5 ppm negligible residues in uncooked edible tissues of
chickens (21 CFR &#167;  556.70).<p>
Tolerances of arsenic (from roxarsone) are established at 0.5 ppm in muscle and
2 ppm in edible by-product (21 CFR &#167;  556.60) with liver as the
target tissue.<p>
<b>b.    Withdrawal Time</b><p>
Based on the information in 21 CFR &#167;  558.550Co)(1)(iv), a 5-day
withdrawal time is required for the combination of bacitracin methylene
disalicylate, roxarsone and salinomycin.<p>
<b>c.    Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels in
all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were significantly
below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>
A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for bacitracin
residues. The method entitled "Modified Microbiological Method for
Determination of Bacitracin in Tissues" is on file at the Center for Veterinary
Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD
20855.<p>
A spectrophotometric method is used to assay tissues for roxarsone residues.
The method is entitled "Arsenic (Total) Residues in Animal Tissues,
Spectrophotometric Method" published in AOAC, 14th Edition 41.009, page 777.<p>
<b>4.    AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of salinomycin sodium, bacitracin methylene
disalicylate, and roxarsone when used under its proposed conditions of use, is
safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

 <b>IV.     Summary of  Safety  and Efficacy:</b>  <p>
 The safety and efficacy data upon which this application was approved are
found  in NADAs   12-491  and  41-275 for  Elanco Products Company,  and are
summarized in an FOI Summary filed with the Dockets Management Branch under the
generic name of the drugs. <p>
 <b>V.      Agency Conclusion:</b> <p>
  Approval of  this  application is based on safety and effectiveness
data  contained  in Elanco Products  Company's  approved NADAs   12-491  and
 41-275.   Use of  the data in NADAs   12-491 and  41-275  to  support  this

<b>Date of Summary:</b>  February 8, 1993<p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS: </b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the 
Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 
1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug application
(ANADA) 
may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new animal drug (pioneer
product). 
New target animal safety data and drug effectiveness data, were not required
for approval 
of this ANADA. This ANADA relies on the target animal safety and drug
effectiveness data 
in the pioneer's new animal drug application. Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor
shows that 
the generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer. Bioequivalence is usually
demonstrated 
through a clinical end-point study.<p>
For certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an in
vivo 
bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; 
Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990). Based upon the formulation
characteristics of the 
generic product, AgriLabs, Ltd. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i>&#160; 
bioequivalence study for gentamicin sulfate solution. The generic and pioneer
products are 
solutions with the same active and inactive ingredients. The generic and
pioneer products  
also contain the same concentration of active ingredient. This ANADA was
granted a 
waiver January 3, 1990 (see attachment). <p>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY: </b><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not 
required for approval of this ANADA. This drug is labeled for use in horses not
intended for 
food.<p>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS: </b><p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that 
gentamicin sulfate solution, when used under its proposed conditions of use, is
safe and 
effective for its labeled indications.<p>

i. Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>

Mortality, rectal temperature, and clinical illness index were measured and recorded daily from Day 0 to the day of necropsy.  Lung consolidation was recorded and lung swabs taken for bacterial
examination at necropsy upon natural death or sacrifice 7 days after end of treatment period.<p>

4.	Results:<p>

Florfenicol prevented mortality from respiratory disease at all dose levels
tested.  Mortality in the non-medicated control group was 25% (3/12).  As
summarized in Table 4.1, the 20&nbsp;mg/kg dose group showed the greatest drop
in rectal temperature and the lowest lung consolidation score at necropsy among
the 3 florfenicol dose groups.<p>

<i>	Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was isolated from 39 (81%) of the 48
pre-treatment naso-pharyngeal swabs of the cattle used in this study.
<i>Pasteurella multocida</i> was found in 16 (33%) of the same 48 swabs.
<i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was isolated from 8 of the 60 post-treatment
lung swabs.  All pathogens (<i>Pasteurella</i>) isolated from either
naso-pharyngeal or lung swabs were sensitive to florfenicol.<p>

c. Control:<p>
Control was a non-drug placebo (normal saline) administered twice, 48 hours apart.<p>

d. Diagnosis:<p>
The diagnosis of BRD was based on acute clinical signs of pneumonia with an elevated rectal temperature (104 F or greater) and respiratory rate (40 per minute or greater). Pretrial nasal swabs were taken for bacterial examination.<p>

e. Dosage Form:<p>
The dosage form was an injectable solution containing 300 mg florfenicol per mL.<p>

f. Route of administration:<p>

Intramuscular injection<p>

g. Doses:<p>Negative control (0 mg/kg) and 20 mg/kg administered twice with a 48
hour interval.<p>

h. Test Duration:<p>

29 days<p>

i. Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>

Mortality from Day 0 to Day 28, and overall treatment success on Day 28 were
the primary variables for assessing efficacy.<p>

4.	Results: <p>

A significant reduction in mortality was observed in the florfenicol-treated
group.  Mortality in the florfenicol-treated group was 4% (1/25), whereas
mortality in the non-medicated control group was 48% (12/25).  Also, as
summarized in Table 4.2, significantly more treatment successes were observed
in the florfenicol group (72%) than in the control group (24%).<p>

<i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was isolated from 25 (50%) of the 50
pre-treatment naso-pharyngeal swabs in this study.  <i>Pasteurella
multocida</i> was found in 6 (12%) of the same 50 swabs.  <i>Haemophilus
somnus</i> was isolated in only one swab.<p>

All pathogens isolated from the naso-pharyngeal swabs were sensitive to
florfenicol.<p>

5. Statistical Analysis:<p>

For qualitative variables, the exact p-values of the Wilcoxon Midrank test were
computed using methods suggested by Mehta, et. al. (<i>Biometrics</i>
40:819-825; 1984), which provided a one-tailed test for the equivalence of the
florfenicol group against placebo with respect to the ordered categorical
responses.  For mortality the Fisher's Exact Test was used.  All the analyses
were performed separately for each observation day.  The results of all
statistical tests were declared significant at the alpha = 0.05 level.<p>

6.	Conclusion:<p>

Under the conditions of this study, florfenicol administered twice
intramuscularly, 48 hours apart, at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, was a safe
and effective treatment of bovine respiratory disease.<p>

7.	Adverse Reactions:<p>

3. General Design:<p>

a. Purpose:<p>
The efficacy of florfenicol, administered by intramuscular
injection at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, repeated at 48&nbsp;hr, for the
treatment of naturally-occurring BRD was tested in positively-controlled field
investigations at several locations.<p>

b. Animals:<p>
One hundred five (105) mixed-breed beef calves that were
approximately 6 months old and weighed an average of 193 kg were used at each
trial location.  At each trial; site, 70 calves were injected with florfenicol
and 35 with the control product.<p>

c. Control:<p>
The control product was an approved oxytetracycline injectable
solution administered for 4 consecutive days, at the dose of 10&nbsp;mg
oxytetracycline per kg body weight (4.5 mg/lb).<p>

d. Diagnosis:<p>
The diagnosis of BRD was based on acute clinical signs of
pneumonia with an elevated rectal temperature (104 F or greater) and
respiratory rate (40 per minute or greater).  Pretreatment nasal swabs were
taken for bacterial examination.<p>

e. Dosage Form:<p>

The test article was an injectable solution containing 300 mg
florfenicol per mL.<p>

f. Test article:<p>

Florfenicol injectable solution was administered twice by
intramuscular injection at a 48-hour interval at a dose of 20 mg/kg body
weight.<p>

h. Test Duration:<p>

29 days<p>

i. Parameters Measured:<p>
Mortality from Day 0 to Day 28, and overall treatment
success on Day 28 were the primary variables for assessing efficacy.<p>

4.	Results: <p>

Day 28 treatment success was significantly greater in the florfenicol-treated
groups than in the oxytetracycline groups at all locations.  Initial treatment
success, relapse, and overall treatment success are summarized in Table 4.3.<p>

Mortality was significantly lower in the florfenicol groups at the Nebraska
and Texas trial locations.  No significant difference in mortality was noted at
the Colorado or Idaho trial locations.  Percent mortality is summarized in
Table 4.4.<p>

5. Microbiology<p>

In the Colorado field trial, <i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was isolated from
81 (77%) of the 105 pre-treatment naso-pharyngeal swabs in this study.
<i>Pasteurella multocida</i> was found in 11 (10%) of the same 105 swabs.  All
pathogens isolated from the naso-pharyngeal swabs were sensitive to florfenicol
with an MIC90 of 2 and 1 ug/mL for <i>P. haemolytica</i>and <i>P. multocida</i>,
respectively.<p>

In the Nebraska field trial, <i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was isolated from
75 (71%) of the 105 pre-treatment naso-pharyngeal swabs of the cattle used in
this study. <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> was found in 3 (3%) of the same 105
swabs.  All pathogens isolated from the naso-pharyngeal swabs were sensitive to
florfenicol with an MIC90 of 2 ug/mL for <i>P. haemolytica.</i>  The MIC90
values for the three<i> P. multocida</i> isolates were 1 ug/mL or less.<p>

In the Idaho field trial, <i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was isolated from 40
(38%) of the 105 pre-treatment naso-pharyngeal swabs of the cattle used in this
study. <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> was found in 50 (48%) of the same 105
swabs.  All pathogens isolated from the naso-pharyngeal swabs were sensitive to
florfenicol.<p>

In the Texas field trial, <i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was isolated from 79
(75%) of the 105 pre-treatment naso-pharyngeal swabs of the cattle used in this
study. <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> was found in 9 (9%) of the same 105 swabs.
<i>Haemophilus somnus</i> was isolated in 3 of those swabs (3%).  All pathogens
isolated from the naso-pharyngeal swabs were sensitive to florfenicol.  MIC90
values for florfenicol were 4 ug/mL for <i>P. haemolytica</i>, and 2 ug/mL for
<i>P. multocida.</i><p>

6. Statistical Analysis:<p>

For qualitative variables, the exact p-values of the Wilcoxon Midrank test were
computed using methods suggested by Mehta, et. al. (in Biometrics, 40 (3),
September 1984, 819-825), which provided a one-tailed test for the equivalence
of the florfenicol group against positive control with respect to the ordered
categorical responses. For mortality the Fisher's Exact Test was used.
All the above analyses were performed separately for each observation day.
The results of all statistical test were declared significant at the alpha =
0.05 level.<p>

7. Conclusion:<p>

Under the conditions of this study, florfenicol administered twice
intramuscularly, 48 hours apart, at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, was a safe
and effective treatment of bovine respiratory disease.<p>

8. Adverse Reactions:<p>
 There were no adverse reactions in either treatment group at any of the four field trial locations.<p>

3. General Design:<p>

a. Purpose:<p>

To confirm the therapeutic efficacy of florfenicol administered
twice, 48 hours apart, by the intramuscular route at the dose of 20 mg/kg body
weight, for the treatment of naturally-occurring bovine respiratory disease
associated with <i>Haemophilus somnus</i>.<p>

b. Animals:<p>

One hundred twenty-five (125) auction-derived, 5 to 10 month old,
mixed-breed beef steers, weighing an average of 278 kg, were used in the study.
Eighty-four (84) steers were treated with NUFLOR Injectable Solution and 41
were treated with a control product.<p>

c. Control:<p>
  The control product was saline administered according to the
NUFLOR Injectable Solution dosage regimen.<p>

d. Diagnosis:<p>
  Diagnosis of BRD and subsequent entrance into the study was
based on rectal temperature &#62;= 105 F for two consecutive days and
the absence of clinical signs referable to organ systems other the respiratory
system.<p>

Exposure to <i>Haemophilus somnus</i> was confirmed at study completion based
on histopathologic lesions characteristic of <i>H. somnus</i> infection, and
the results of microbiological culture of blood, nasal swabs, and transtracheal
washes.<p>

e. Dosage Form:<p>

The dosage form was an injectable solution containing 300 mg
florfenicol per mL.<p>

f. Route of administration:<p>

Intramuscular.<p>

g. Doses:<p>
Florfenicol injectable solution and the placebo were administered
twice with a 48 hour interval at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight.<p>

h. Test Duration:<p>

15 days<p>

i. Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>

Mortality was monitored daily from Day 0 to Day 15, rectal temperature was measured and recorded from Day -1 to Day 4 and on Day 15.  Relapses were recorded from day 4 to day 15. An animal was considered a treatment success if it met the entrance criteria, was subsequently treated, and did not relapse.<p>

4. Results:<p>

Microbiology:<p>
  <i>Haemophilus somnus</i> was isolated in 12% (10/84) of the nasal swabs and/or transtracheal washes in the NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution group and in 7% (3/41) of the controls.  <i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i> was present in 26% (22/84) and 29% (12/41) of the nasal swabs
and/or transtracheal washes from the NUFLOR Injectable Solution and saline treatment groups, respectively.  <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> was isolated in 29% (24/84) of the NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution group and 34% (14/41) of the saline group.<p>

<i>Haemophilus somnus</i> exposure:<p>
Based on lung histopathology and positive <i>H. somnus</i> cultures from nasal swabs and/or transtracheal washes, 12% (10/84) of the calves in the florfenicol treatment group and 15% (6/41) of the calves in the control group were considered exposed to <i>H. somnus</i>.<p>

Mortality:<p>

Overall study mortality was 1.2% (1/84) in the florfenicol
treatment group and 34% (14/41) in the control group.  In regard to the 16
animals considered exposed to <i>H. somnus</i>, there were no mortalities in
the florfenicol-treated animals and 83% (5/6) mortality in control animals.<p>

Treatment success:<p>

As summarized in Table 4.5, there were significantly more overall treatment successes in the florfenicol treatment group (62%) than in the control group (12%).  In regard to animals considered exposed to <i>H. somnus</i> , 7 of the 10 florfenicol-treated animals were treatment successes,
and 1 of the 6 control animals was a treatment success.<p>

Overall treatment success and mortality were analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic.  Treatment success and mortality for animals exposed to <i>H. somnus</i> were analyzed using the Fisher's Exact test for 2 X 2 tables.<p>

6. Conclusion:<p>
Under the conditions of this study, florfenicol administered
twice, 48 hours apart, by the intramuscular route at the dose of 20 mg/kg body
weight was a safe and effective treatment of bovine respiratory disease
associated with <i>Haemophilus somnus</i>.<p>

7. Adverse Reactions:<p>

There were no adverse reactions in either treatment group.<p>

H. Pharmacokinetics<p>

The pharmacokinetic information provided in the labeling for
NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution was based on the following
published study.<p>

Lobell, R.D., Varma, K.J., Johnson, J.C., Sams, R.A., Gerken, D.F., Ashcraft,
S.M..  Pharmacokinetics of florfenicol following intravenous and intramuscular
doses to cattle.  <i>J. Vet. Pharmacol. Therap.</i>  <b>17</b>, 253-258, 1994.<p>

The disposition of florfenicol after single intravenous and intramuscular
doses of 20 mg of florfenicol/kg of body weight (b.w.) to feeder calves was
investigated.  Serum florfenicol concentrations were determined by a sensitive
high performance liquid chromatographic method with a limit of quantitation of
0.025 ug/mL.  The extent of serum protein binding of florfenicol was only 13.2%
at a serum florfenicol concentration of 3.0 ug/mL.  Serum concentration-time
data after intravenous administration were best described by a triexponential
equation.  Total body clearance and steady state volume of distribution were
3.75 mL/min/kg b.w. and 761 mL/kg b.w., respectively.  The terminal half-life
after intravenous administration was 159 minutes.  The absolute systemic
availability after intramuscular administration was 78.5% (range:  59.3-106%)
and the harmonic mean of the terminal half-life was 1098 minutes, indicating
slow release of the florfenicol from the formulation at the intramuscular
injection site.  <p>

I. Microbiology<p>

Data from fifteen studies conducted between 1990 and 1993, in the United
States, Europe, and Canada were used to establish an MIC data base for
florfenicol against bacteria isolated from cattle with naturally occurring
bovine respiratory disease.  The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of
florfenicol determined for isolates of <i>Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella
multocida</i>,<i> </i>and<i> Haemophilus somnus</i>  are shown in Table 4.6.<p>

<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>

A Drug Tolerance Test in beef calves was conducted to determine the
tolerance to and clinical profile of a 10X overdose (200 mg/kg) of the intended
clinical dose of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution.  A Target Animal
Safety Study in beef calves was conducted to address the safety of multiple
injections of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution at the 1X (20 mg/kg), 3X (60 mg/kg), and 5X (100 mg/kg) dose levels.  An Injection Site Irritation Study was conducted to determine the irritation potential of the intramuscular route of administration.  In addition, a feed consumption
study was conducted to provide additional information regarding the impact of
florfenicol treatment on feed consumption in calves.<p>

A. Drug Tolerance Test<p>

1. Type of Study:<p>

This was a 17-day study in which 2 separate injections of
florfenicol injectable solution were administered 48 hours apart to 4
cross-bred beef calves.  Following the dosing period, the calves were observed
and necropsied on Day 17 (15 days following the last injection of the test
article).<p>

attributed to slight ketosis due to anorexia.<p>

f. Fecal Examination:<P>

No test article-related effects were observed.<p>

g. Gross and Histopathologic Observations:<P>

Florfenicol-related changes were limited to the injection sites.  Gross lesions included injection site swelling, discoloration, hardness, and loss of texture.  Histopathologically,
these lesions correlated with minimal to moderate edema, skeletal muscle
degeneration/necrosis, hemorrhage, inflammation, fibrosis, and some mineralization.  The injection site lesions appeared to be healing.<p>

5. Statistical Analysis:<p>

  none<p>
  
6. Conclusions:<P>

 Florfenicol-related changes included marked anorexia, decreased water consumption, decreased body weight, and elevated serum enzymes of liver and muscle origin during the dosing period.  These parameters returned to normal during the post-dose period.  Florfenicol-related local irritation at
the injection site was noted. <p>

B. Toxicity Test (1X, 3X, 5X Study)<p>

1. Type of Study:<p>

This was a 13-day study in which six total intramuscular injections of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution at doses of 0, 20, 60, or 100 mg florfenicol/kg body weight were administered to cross-bred beef calves.<p>

Florfenicol injectable solution, 300 mg/mL<p>
  
e. Route of Administration:<P>

 Intramuscular injection<p>
 
f. Dose:<P>

0, 20, 60, or 100 mg/kg body weight every other day for a total of 6
doses<p>

g. Test Duration:  13 days<p>

h. Pertinent Parameters Measured:<p>

clinical observations, physical examinations, feed and water consumption, body weights, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, fecal examinations, gross pathology, and histopathology.<p>

4. Results<p>

a. Clinical Observations:<p>

Treatment-related changes observed at all dose levels included depression, soft feces, and slight dehydration.  These effects were observed most frequently in the 60 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg dose groups,
primarily near the end of dosing.<p>

b. Feed and water consumption:<P>

A slight decrease in feed and water intake was observed at the 20 mg/kg dose level.  Decreased feed and water intake was observed at the 60 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg dose levels. <p>

c. Body Weight:<P>

Decreased body weight gain was observed in the 60 and 100
mg/kg dose groups.<p>

d. Hematology/Serum Chemistry:<P>

Increased serum enzymes (LDH, SGOT, SAP, SGPT) were observed indicating liver and muscle changes in the 60 and 100 mg/kg dose groups. <p>

e. Urinalysis:<P>

 Decreased urine pH in the 60 and 100 mg/kg dose groups.<p>
 
f. Fecal Blood:<P>

No treatment-related effects.<p>

g. Gross and Histopathological Observations:<P>

Florfenicol related lesions were limited to the injection sites.  All treated groups had gross lesions at the injection sites including swelling, discoloration, hardness, and loss of
texture.  The lesions were slightly larger in the 60 and 100 mg/kg dose groups.
Histopathologically, these lesions correlated with minimal to moderate edema,
skeletal muscle degeneration/necrosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and some mineralization.<p>

6. Statistical Analysis:<P>

Study data were tabulated and, as appropriate, summarized through calculation of mean and standard deviation values.<p>

7. Conclusions:<P>

Minor changes attributed to florfenicol intramuscular injection were seen in calves receiving the recommended dosage (20 mg/kg) when administered for three times the recommended duration of treatment. Florfenicol administered at the recommended dose and duration may produce
transient inappetance, decreased water consumption, or diarrhea.  <p>

C. Injection Site Irritation Study I<p>

1. Type of Study:<P>
This was a 57-day study in which four groups of calves were dosed with two injections of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution, 300 mg/mL in two sites (right side neck and rump musculature).  Each dose was administered at a calculated dose of 20 mg/kg body weight.  In addition, a
similar volume of physiologic saline was injected in two sites (left side neck
and rump musculature).<p>

3. General Design:<p>

a. Purpose:<p>

To determine the injection site muscle irritation potential of
NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution, 300 mg/mL, when administered
intramuscularly at a dose 20 mg/kg body weight in each of 2 separate sites
(neck and rump musculature)<p>

b. Animals:<P>
 32 crossbred beef calves (189 to 269 kg), 16 males and 16 females<p>
 
c. Control:<P>
Sterile, normal physiological saline <p>

d. Dosage Form:<P>

 florfenicol solution, 300 mg/mL<p>
 
e. Route of Administration:<P>

intramuscular injection<p>

f. Dose:<P>

20 mg/kg bw; injection in two sites (right side neck and rump)<p>

g. Test Duration:<P>

57 days<p>

h. Pertinent Measurements/Observations:<P>

Clinical observations, body weight, gross and microscopic pathology.  Injection sites were examined visually and by palpation prior to injection, at 4 hours post-dose, and then daily through the
first 14 days post-injection and twice weekly thereafter until necropsy.  Four animals of each gender were euthanized for collection and evaluation of injection site tissues at 28, 35, 42, and 56 days post-injection.<p>

4. Results<p>

a. Neck injection sites:<P>

Palpable swellings were observed at some neck injection sites.  No post-mortem injection site lesions were observed at the four post-injection examination times.<p>

b. Rump injection sites:<P>

Only the rump injection sites showed florfenicol-related gross lesions including discoloration, hardness, and loss of texture.  The severity of the gross lesions decreased as the post-dose
period increased.  Microscopically these lesions correlated with minimal to
mild edema, skeletal muscle degeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, and some
mineralization.  By the end of the 56-day post-dose period, only mild fibrosis
and inflammation persisted at the florfenicol injection site.<p>

5. Statistical Analysis:<P>

none<p>

6. Conclusions:<P>

NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution when administered intramuscularly at a dose of 20 mg florfenicol/kg body weight causes local irritation at the injection site which tends to resolve over time.  Irritation resulting from injection into the rump musculature took longer to resolve than
did irritation resulting from injection into the neck musculature.  Gross
injection site lesions resolved within 28 days post-injection when florfenicol
was administered in the neck musculature.  However, gross and histopathologic
changes were still apparent at 56 days post-injection when florfenicol was
administered in the rump musculature.<p>

D. Injection Site Irritation Study II<p>

1. Type of Study:<P>

This was a 55-day study in which 16 beef calves were dosed
with two injections of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution, 300 mg/mL,
in two sites (right and left sides of the neck).  A dose volume of 10 mL was
administered at one site and a dose volume of 20 mL at the other site.<p>

3. General Design:<p>

a. Purpose:<p>

To evaluate the effects of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable
Solution, 300 mg/mL, on muscle tissue of cattle following intramuscular
administration of 10 mL and 20 mL in the cervical region.  <p>

b. Animals:<p>

16 crossbred beef calves (mean weight 291 kg)<p>

c. Dosage Form:<p>

florfenicol solution, 300 mg/mL<p>

d. Route of Administration:<p>

intramuscular injection in cervical region<p>

e. Dose: <p>

 10 mL and 20 mL injections on opposite sides of neck<p>
 
f. Test Duration:  55 days<p>

g. Pertinent Measurements/Observations:<P>

Following injection, the calves were observed daily for post-injection pain, changes in mobility, and visible swelling.  Injection sites were examined visually and by palpation on days 0,
2, 5, 7, 9, and 14.  Eight calves were euthanized on Day 28 and Day 55,
respectively.  Sixteen injection sites (2 per calf) were collected at each time
point for gross and microscopic examination.  <p>

4. Results<p>

a. Live animal observations:<P>

Injection site swellings were not observed, or palpable on Days 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, and 14 post-injection of 10 mL or 20 mL of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution. <p>

b. Day 28 post-mortem evaluation:<P>

Five of the 8 sites injected with 10 mL had little or no grossly observable lesions at necropsy.  Three sites were observed to have measurable lesions that included fascial discoloration, white streaks in muscle, and one lesion contained a small amount of clear fluid.<p>

 Three of the 8 sites injected with 20 mL had little or no grossly observable
lesions at necropsy.  Five sites were observed to have measurable lesions that
included muscle discoloration, nodules in the fascia, granulomas, and two
lesions contained small amounts of clear fluid.<p>

c. Day 55 post-mortem evaluation:<P>

Fifteen of the 16 injection sites had no visible lesions present at 55 days post-injection.  One lesion was observed in a 20 mL injection site, and was characterized as an area of accentuated fascia
with adjacent muscle discoloration.<p>

5. Statistical Analysis:<P>

  none<p>
  
6. Conclusions:<P>

NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution when administered at a dose volume of 10 mL in the cervical musculature may cause local tissue reaction that persists beyond 28 days post-injection.  No tissue reaction was observed at 55 days post-injection with 10 mL of NUFLOR &#174; in the
cervical musculature.<p>

3. General Design:<p>

a. Purpose:<P>

To evaluate the effect of florfenicol administered twice, 48 hours
apart, by the intramuscular route at the dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, on the
weight gain and feed consumption of healthy feeder cattle.<p>

b. Animals:<p>

16 mixed-breed beef cattle (8 males, 8 females) ranging in age from 6 to 8 months were housed in 16 individual pens. The initial mean weight was 220.8 kg.  The 16 calves were randomized by sex and weight and assigned to one of two treatment groups of 4 females and 4 steers each.<p>

c. Control:<p>

The control product was a 0.9% sodium chloride solution injected twice, 48 hours apart, at the dose of 0.67 mL per 10 kg.<p>

d. Dosage Form of Test Article:<P>

A solution containing 300 mg florfenicol per mL.<p>

e. Route of administration:<P>

intramuscular injection<p>
  
f. Doses:<P>

 Both the placebo and florfenicol injectable solution were
administered as two doses at a 48-hour interval.<p>

g. Test Duration:<P>

  43 days<p>
  
h. Pertinent Parameters Measured:<P>

  Weekly weight and daily feed intake.<p>
  
4. Results:  <p>

No significant difference was found between the treatment groups for cattle
weight at the initial weighing (Day 0) or at any of the post-treatment time
points.  <p>

A statistically significant decrease in feed consumption was observed on Days 1
and 2 in cattle treated with florfenicol compared to saline treated cattle. No
significant difference was apparent between the two groups at Day 0 or any day
from Day 3 to Day 42. <p>

5. Statistical Analysis:<p>

Cattle weight and daily feed consumption were analyzed for between treatment
group differences with respect to changes from pretreatment using analysis of
covariance. Analysis of variance was used to analyze pre-treatment levels.  All
analyses were blocked on sex, and type III sums of squares were used for the
ANOVA/ANCOVA.<p>

Analysis of between treatment group differences for increase in mean cattle
weight and daily feed intake were evaluated by a comparison of linear
regressions, following the method discussed in <i>Applied Linear Statistical
Methods</i> (Neter and Wasserman; Richard D. Irwin Inc. [Illinois, 1974], pp.
160-167). All analyses were conducted separately for each sex.  The level for
statistical significance was defined as p=0.05.<p>

6. Conclusion:<p>

A transient statistically significant decline in feed consumption was observed in the florfenicol treated cattle for two consecutive days (the day after the first injection and the day of the second injection). However, under the conditions of this study where florfenicol was administered
twice, 48 hours apart, by the intramuscular route at the dose of 20 mg/kg body
weight to healthy cattle, florfenicol had no effect on weight gain and no long
term effect on feed consumption when compared to saline.  <p>

7. Adverse Reactions: <P>

 There was no evidence of adverse reaction in either of
the treatment groups except transient pain following the florfenicol
injections.<p>

j. Parameters Tested: <P>
 The objective of this assay was to evaluate the ability
of florfenicol to induce forward mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK) locus
in the presence and absence of S9, as assayed by colony growth of L5178Y TK+/-
mouse lymphoma cells in the presence of 5-trifluorthymidine (TFT).<p>

k. Significant Toxicity Observed:<p>

Under nonactivation conditions, moderate to high toxicities were induced by
florfenicol.  The induced mutant frequencies of the florfenicol treated groups

 For the definitive tests, the following concentrations were selected (which
were restricted due to the solubility limits of florfenicol):<p>

 In presence of S9:  313, 625, 1250, and 2500 ug/mL of florfenicol; 6-hr
treatment<p>
 In absence of S9:  62.5, 125, 625, and 1250 ug/mL of florfenicol; 24-hr
treatment<p>
j. Route of Drug Administration:<P>
  not applicable<p>
  
k. Parameters Tested:<P>

Florfenicol was evaluated for clastogenic potential using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in vitro both in the presence and absence of a postmitochondrial supernatant fluid preparation (S9).<p>

l. Significant Toxicity Observed:<P>

In the presence of S9 mix, florfenicol induced structural chromosomal aberrations at the highest dose tested of 2500 ug/mL.  The aberrations were notably chromatid breaks and exchanges.  This dose
level was toxic in that the cell count of these cultures was much reduced. Levels of endoreduplicated cells observed in cultures treated with 1250 and 2500 ug/mL florfenicol were consistently raised.<p>

In the absence of S9 mix, there was no evidence that florfenicol was capable
of inducing either structural or numerical chromosomal aberrations.  One
culture treated at the highest dose of 1250 ug/mL had a slightly elevated level
of chromatid gaps.<p>

m. No Observed Effect Level:<P>
  not applicable<p>
  
n. Statistical Analysis:<P>
 Statistical evaluation of in-house historical data from vehicle and untreated control culture has enabled acceptable aberration frequency ranges for a negative response to be defined, and are based on 95% and 99% confidence limits of mean values.<p>

o. Conclusions:<P>
 It was concluded that florfenicol, when tested with CHO cells, was clastogenic at toxic dose levels and was capable of inducing endoreduplication at both toxic and non-toxic dose levels.  These effects were only seen when florfenicol was tested in the presence of a metabolic activation system (S9 mix).<p>

f. Species and Strain:<P>
  Adult mice, strain ICR<p>
g. Number of Animals per Sex per Treatment Group:<p>
  5<p>
  
h. Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:<P>
  Acute: 500, 1667, 5000 mg/kg of florfenicol administered one time only.  Harvest times were 6, 18 and 30 hours post dose.  Subchronic: 500, 1667, 5000 mg/kg of florfenicol administered daily
for 5 days.  Harvest time was 6 hours after the last dose.<p>

i. Route of Drug Administration:<P>
  oral (gavage)<p>
  
j. Parameters Tested:<P>
  To verify the cytogenetic potential of florfenicol, in vivo cytogenetics were conducted in mouse bone marrow cells using both acute and subacute exposure regimens.  <p>

k. Significant Toxicity Observed:<P>

In the acute trial, two males in the 30 hour harvest group, one dosed with 500 mg/kg and one dosed with 1667 mg/kg died approximately 28 and 30 hours after dosing, respectively.  All other mice
appeared normal and remained healthy until the appropriate harvest times. fluorfenicol under either the acute or subchronic exposure conditions of the assay did not induce significant increases in the percentage of chromosomally aberrant cells in either sex, at any harvest time or at any dose level over the level of aberrations observed in the concurrent vehicle controls.  In the
subchronic trial there was a dose related decrease in the mitotic index in both
sexes.  These data provided evidence that higher doses could not have been used
and that florfenicol induced systemic effects on the bone marrow.<p>

l. No Observed Effect Level: <P>
 not applicable<p>
 
m. Statistical Analysis:<P>
  The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed at the alpha = 0.05 level to determine whether any of the mean values among the PEG 400 vehicle control and treatment groups were significantly different from each other.<p>

n. Conclusions:<P>
Florfenicol was considered negative for inducing chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells of male and female mice under both the acute and subchronic dosing conditions of this study, indicating that florfenicol was a non-clastogen in vivo.  Therefore, the previous concerns for the clastogenic
potential of florfenicol raised by the positive in the in vitro test were alleviated.<p>

e. Substance and Dosage Form:<p>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone is an organic solvent which is used as an excipient in the NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution formulation.<p>

f. Species and Strain:<p>
 The tester strains used were the <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> histidine auxotrophs TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538.  <p>

g. Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:<p>

The doses tested in the mutagenicity assay were selected based upon the results of a dose range finding study using tester strain TA100 and ten dose levels of test article ranging from 5000 to 6.67 ug per plate, one plate per dose, both in the presence and absence of S9.  The assay was conducted using three plates per dose level both in the presence and absence of S9.  Six doses of test article were tested, from 5000 to 100 ug per plate both in the presence and absence of S9.<p>

h. Parameters Tested:<p>
This assay evaluates the test article and/or its metabolites for their ability to induce reverse mutations at the histidine locus in the genome of specific <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> tester strains both in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system of mammalian microsomal enzymes derived from Aroclor-induced rat liver (S9).<p>

i. Significant Toxicity Observed:<p>

In the initial mutagenicity assay, all data were acceptable and no positive increases in the number of histidine revertants were observed with any of the tester strains either in the presence or absence of S9.  In the confirmatory assay, all data were acceptable and no positive increases in the number of histidine revertants per plate were observed with any of the tester strains either in the presence or absence of S9.<p>

j. Conclusion:<p>
 N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was not mutagenic under the conditions of this assay.<p>

d. Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:<p>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone liquid<p>

e. Summary:<p>
In the <i>In Vitro</i> Rat Primary Hepatocyte Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) Assay, the test material did not induce significant increases in UDS.  Freshly prepared rat hepatocytes were exposed to N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at concentrations ranging from 0.500 ug/mL to 5000 ug/mL in the presence of 5&nbsp;mCi/mL<sup>3</sup>HTdr (20 Ci/mmole).  Treatment at 5000 ug/mL was not analyzed for nuclear labeling due to high toxicity. Treatments from 4000 ug/mL to 250 ug/mL, which covered a good range
of toxicity (75.3 to 97.6% survival), were selected for analysis.  The test material was soluble in media at all concentrations tested.  None of the criteria used to indicate UDS were approached by the chemical treatments and dose-related response was observed.<p>

h. Conclusions:<p>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was evaluated as inactive in the Rat Primary Hepatocyte UDS assay<p>

d. Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:<p>
 N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone liquid<p>
 
e. Summary:<p>
The objective of this <i>in vitro</i> assay was to evaluate the ability of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to induce forward mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosporibosyl transferase (HGPRT) locus in Chinese hamster ovary cells under conditions with and without metabolic activation.<p>

The test material was soluble in F12 culture medium at 50.0 mg/mL. Preliminary range finding cytotoxicity testing found the test article to be nontoxic at all dose levels tested from 0.005 mg/mL to 5.0 mg/mL under both nonactivation and S9 metabolic activation test conditions.  For each test
condition, six dose levels that ranged from 0.5 mg/mL to 5.0 mg/mL were used in the mutation assays.  The test article was not toxic at any dose level in the mutation assays.<p>

Mutant frequencies of all cultures treated with test material varied randomly with dose within a range acceptable for negative control mutant frequencies. In the S9 metabolic activation mutation assay, one of the six treatment conditions achieved statistical significance.  The culture that achieved statistical significance had a mutant frequency within the acceptable range for  background mutant frequencies.  The statistical significance was apparently due to normal assay variation.  Without S9 metabolic activation, none of the six dose levels had mutant frequencies that achieved statistical significance. Therefore, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was considered  negative for inducing forward mutation at the HGPRT locus in CHO cells under the S9 metabolic activation and nonactivation conditions of the assay.<p>

N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone liquid<p>

e. Summary:<p>
This study was conducted to evaluate the safety of the compound N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone following a 90-day administration in the diet of weanling rats.  Two hundred (200) weanling FDRL-Wistar rats (25/sex/dose level) were dosed with 0 (control), 800, 2000, and 5000 ppm of the compound.  The 800,
2000 and 5000 ppm dosages produced a significant decrease (p&#60;0.05) on female body weights, increase in male thyroid weight, and changes in the chemical properties of urine (pH in males and females, albumin and specific gravity in females, and SGPT in males at termination).  It was concluded, however, that the 800 ppm dose level (which equated to 40 mg/kg consumption level) was the no effect level (NOEL) for the compound in this study.<p>

 This study was conducted to evaluate the potential systemic toxicity of dietary n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone when administered to beagle dogs for 90 days at dose levels of 0, 25, 79 and 250 mg/kg body weight. Forty-eight (24 male and 24 female) beagle dogs ranging from 5 to 6 months of
age at the beginning of the study were included.  Body weights and food consumption were measured weekly, animals were observed daily, blood samples for hematology and biochemical determination were collected and analyzed pretest, 60 days after initiation and at termination.  At the termination of
the study (90&nbsp;days), gross and microscopic examinations were performed.<p>

No signs of toxicity or behavioral abnormalities were observed during the study.  Intermittent significant variations in total cholesterol, serum albumin and serum total protein were noted but toxicological significance was not supported by any histopathological finding.  No test article related histopathological findings were noted in any organs and analysis of organ weight failed to reveal any significant treatment differences.<p>

The only unusual finding was a very minimal growth rate of all dogs in the study.  Although food consumption was similar among all groups, the high dose males gained almost no weight compared to the controls after the 90-day period. The NOEL for the study was 79 mg/kg body weight/day based on the lack of body weight gain of the high dose group.<p>

e. Summary:<p>
 This study was conducted to evaluate the teratogenic  potential of N- methyl-2-pyrrolidone administered dermally to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at 0 (negative, positive and aspirin control groups), 75, 237 or 750 mg/kg body weight per day on days 6 through 15 of gestation.  Six (6) groups were utilized providing 25 female rats per group.  On Day 20 of gestation, all animals were
euthanized for uterine examination and fetal examination for skeletal and soft tissue abnormalities.<p>

The frequency and severity of dry skin and bright yellow urine increased with dosage. Maternal toxicity was evidenced by significantly lower body weights on days 15 and 20, and reduced weight gains during gestation in the 750 mg/kg/day females.  The high dose also resulted in fewer live fetuses per dam, an increase in the percentage of resorption sites (although the percentage of dams
showing resorptions was unaffected), and a significant reduction in fetal weights.<p>

 Fetal examination revealed a variety of skeletal variations at the 750 mg/kg dose which indicates possible retardation in fetal development and possibly a teratogenic potential of the compound at high doses.  Treatment with 750 mg/kg/day of the compound could be considered maternally toxic since it resulted in observations similar to those of the positive controls administered hexafluoroacetone solution.  No maternal or fetal effects were seen in the animals treated with 75 or 237 mg/kg/day of the compound.  No teratogenic effects were seen at the dose levels tested.  The NOEL for maternal and fetal toxicity was 237 mg/kg body weight/day.<p>

d. Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:<p>
 N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone liquid<p>

e. Summary:<p>
Inseminated New Zealand White SPF female rabbits were used to determine the development toxicity including the teratogenic potential of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.  The rabbits were randomly assigned to one placebo control and three treatment groups (55, 175 and 540 mg/kg/day) consisting of
twenty (20) animals each.  The treatments were administered orally by gavage as a single daily dose on gestation Days 6 through 18 at a volume of 3.0 mL/kg. Cesarean section examinations were performed on all females on gestation Day-29, followed by teratologic examination of the fetuses.<p>

Maternal toxicity was observed at 540 mg/kg/day.  Statistically significant inhibition of maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at this level and an abortion at 540 mg/kg/day was confirmed.  At 175 mg/kg/day, there appeared to be a dose related trend toward inhibited body weight gain; however, this inhibition was only statistically significant during first treatment subinterval (days 6-12).  This, plus the fact that reduced feed consumption did not attain statistical significance when compared to the control group, and in the absence of any other overt signs of toxicity, does not clearly establish the 175 mg/kg/day dose as maternally toxic.<p>

Developmental toxicity was observed at 540 mg/kg/day manifested by increased postimplantation loss, increased incidences of cardiovascular and skull malformations and developmental variations.<p>

The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) based on this study was equivocally considered to be 55 mg/kg/day with respect to maternal toxicity, and 175 mg/kg/day with respect to developmental toxicity.<p>

d. Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:<p>
 N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone liquid<p>
 
e. Summary:<p>
A two generation reproduction study with two litters per generation was conducted with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at dose levels of 50, 160, and 500 mg/kg/day in the diet.  No reproductive effects were seen in the P1 generation.  However, high dose F1b (P2) male mating indices and fertility indices were lower than controls for both litters.  High dose female (P2) fertility and fecundity indices were lower than controls for both litters. Additionally, there were differences in survival indices and growth rate of all litters with 500 mg/kg/day of the compound.  The NOEL for reproductive and developmental effects was established as 160 mg/kg/day of the compound.<p>

f. Conclusions:<p>
The 160 mg/kg/day dose was established as the parental, reproductive and developmental NOAEL in this study.<p>

The calculation of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)  for residues of florfenicol
was based upon the NOEL of 1 mg/kg/day from the two-generation reproduction
study in rats with an assigned safety factor (SF) of 100.<p>

</pre>

The average human weight is approximated as 60 kg.  The daily consumption values of
tissues are approximated as 300 g for muscle, 50 g for fat, 100 g for liver,
and 50 g for kidney.<p>

4. Threshold Assessment:  Florfenicol was negative in genotoxicity assays and was
not carcinogenic in mouse and rat carcinogenicity bioassays.<p>

5. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone<p>

The NOEL from the 90-day rat study (40 mg/kg) was used to calculate the safe concentration for total residues of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in edible tissues.  Using a safety factor of 1000, and average consumption values for edible tissues, the calculated safe concentrations for the total residues of
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in muscle, liver, kidney, and fat are 8, 24, 48, and 48 ppm, respectively.  In the absence of chronic toxicity studies in the rodent and dog, the maximum allowable residue that can be assigned to muscle is 5 ppm.<p>

Radioassay of the urine and feces samples showed that the majority (63% to 71%) of the administered 14C-florfenicol was excreted via the urine with only minor amounts (6%-9%) appearing in the feces.<p>

2.	Metabolism of Florfenicol in Cattle<p>

The metabolism of 14C-florfenicol was investigated as part of the total residue study discussed above (Study # 90708).  Metabolites were isolated and identified in the urine, feces, liver, kidneys, and injection sites. Tissue and feces samples were initially extracted with methanol to determine
the amount of free and bound residues. The methanol extracts were then analyzed by HPLC to determine the amounts and identities of the individual metabolites present.  Urine samples were analyzed directly by HPLC.  The residue present in liver and kidney tissue was predominantly non-extractable (bound) residue from which florfenicol amine can be released by strong acid hydrolysis.<p>

E.	Total Residue Depletion and Metabolism Studies - N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone<p>

Because the depletion characteristics of the excipient used in NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution were not known, a total residue study was conducted to determine whether the product would be regulated on the basis of the excipient, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or on the marker residue for the active ingredient florfenicol. <p>

1.	Total Residue Depletion Study of [14C]-M-Pyrol (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone) Residues in the Calf Following Intramuscular Administration of  M-Pyrol with Florfenicol.  Study No. 90714; P-Report 5743
(11 May 95).<p>

a.	Name and Address of Investigator:<p>

Test Facility (In-Life Portion):
Southwest Bio-Labs, Inc.

b. Test animals:<p>
The test animals consisted of 12 crossbred cattle arranged (6 steers and 6 heifers) in four groups of three cattle per sacrifice time point.  At the time of dosing, the cattle body weight range was 155 to 207 kg.<p>

c. Route of Administration and Time/Duration of Dosing:<p>

The cattle were dosed intramuscularly on study days 1 and 3 with a solution of
[14C] N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (14C-NMP) containing florfenicol at a rate of 16.7 mg of NMP/kg body weight/day (reflecting the normal level of excipient NMP used in the NUFLOR Solution formulation).  The cattle were sacrificed by group at 0.5, 5, 15 and 30 days after the last dose.
<p>

d.	Radioisotope:<p>

14C-N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone was uniformly ring-labeled.  The specific activities of the dose preparations used in this study were 617-2781 dpm/ug. Radiochemical purities were 95.98-98.85% (HPLC) and 99.47-100% (TLC). The radiolabeled injectable solution used in this study was prepared according
to the proposed florfenicol formulation intended for use in cattle.<p>

e.	Total Residue Concentrations:<p>

Edible tissues (muscle, liver, kidney and fat) were collected at each sacrifice time point and analyzed for total <sup>14</sup>C-NMP residues (ppm calculated as NMP). The mean concentrations of total NMP residues are shown in Table 6.4.<p>

Urine was the primary route of elimination of total 14C-NMP residues
accounting for 65% of the administered dose, while residues in the feces
accounted for 16% of the administered dose.<p>

2. Metabolism of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<p>

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine profiles
of metabolites in extracts of urine, feces, and liver.  The major
14C-component found in cattle urine, feces, and liver extracts was
N-methyl succinimide, representing approximately 31, 23, and 42% of total
sample extract radioactivity, respectively.  14C-NMP was found to be
a minor component in urine and feces extracts, while it represented
approximately 18% of liver extract radioactivity.  A major unknown metabolite
was found in significant amounts:  32% in urine, 17% in feces, and 6% in liver
extracts. <p>

Analysis of liver extracts from male and female rats demonstrated the presence
of florfenicol, florfenicol amine, florfenicol alcohol, florfenicol oxamic
acid, monochloroflorfenicol, and unknowns 1-6.  The rat liver, urine and feces
metabolite profiles were qualitatively similar to those observed in cattle.
Thus, the rats used in the toxicity tests were exposed to all of the
metabolites appearing in the profiles from cattle liver and kidney.<p>

2.	Test Facility (In-Life and Analysis):	Schering-Plough Research Institute<p>

144 Route 94 South<p>
	Lafayette, NJ  07848<p>

3.	Study Design:<p>

	Twelve rats (6F, 6M: Crl:CD(SD)BR VAF/PLUS) were divided into two dose groups
(1 and 2), each containing six rats (3M,3F).  The rats in each group were dosed
with 400 mg of <sup>14</sup>C-NMP/kg/day by gavage for three consecutive days.
The <sup>14</sup>C-NMP was uniformly ring labeled and the specific activities
of <sup>14</sup>C-NMP were 570 dpm/ug (Group 1) and 2137 dpm/ug (Group 2).
Urine and feces were collected at 24-hr intervals throughout the study until
sacrifice 48 hr following the final dose.  Urine, feces, liver, kidneys,
carcass and cage wash were analyzed for total radioactivity.  HPLC
<sup>14</sup>C-profiles were determined for extracts of urine, feces and
liver.<p>

4.	Results:<p>

	An average of 79% (males) and 76%(females) of the total <sup>14</sup>C-dose
was eliminated in the urine; 4% was recovered in the feces.  Unchanged
<sup>14</sup>C-NMP was the major <sup>14</sup>C-component found in the liver
(58% of the sample extract), the second largest component in feces (20% of the
sample extract), and was detected in the urine (3% of the sample extract).
N-Methylsuccinimide was found in extracts of urine (2%), feces (&#60;2%), and
liver (9%). <p>

	The HPLC metabolite profiles found in rat urine, feces and liver were found to
be qualitatively similar to those previously determined in cattle urine, feces
and liver (P-5743).  The comparison of metabolites of NMP in rats following
oral administration, and in cattle following intramuscular administration,
indicates that the NMP-derived residues in the edible tissues of target animals
(cattle) have been adequately tested in the toxicological species (rat).<p>

H.	Selection of a Target Tissue, Marker Residue, and Determination of a
Tolerance<p>

The data in total residue study # 90708 with <sup>14</sup>C-florfenicol in
cattle established that liver is the edible tissue of cattle in which residues
of florfenicol are highest and persist longest.  Study # 90708 also showed that
the majority of the total residue in liver is bound (non-extractable), and that
strong acid hydrolysis will release florfenicol amine in high yield from the
bound residue as well ass from  the extractable residues.  These observations
lead to the development of a regulatory assay for florfenicol (see Part J)
based on florfenicol amine as the marker residue and liver as the target
tissue.<p>

The tolerance assignment for residues of florfenicol amine in cattle liver also
was done with data from the livers of cattle dosed with
<sup>14</sup>C-florfenicol in study # 90708.  The radioassays for the livers
and the parallel assay by the HPLC determinative procedure provided the data
listed below and allowed calculation of the percentage of florfenicol amine in
the total residue present in each liver as measured by the HPLC assay.<p>

A graphical presentation of these data shows that, when florfenicol total
residues in liver are at the safe concentration of 6.0 ppm, florfenicol amine
will be at an average level of 3.7 ppm, as measured by the HPLC assay.  Thus,
3.7 ppm (61% 0f 6.0 ppm) is assigned as the tolerance for florfenicol amine in
cattle liver.<p>

4. Animals Used:<p>
Twenty five (25) Hereford and Hereford-cross cattle (mixed sexes) were used in this study.  At the time of dosing, the animals were 7 to 8 months of age and 214 to 319 kg in body weight.<p>

5. Route of drug administration:<p>

Each animal was given two intramuscular doses of florfenicol with a 48 hour interval in between.<p>

6. Time and duration of dosing:<P>
Each animal received a 20 mg/kg bw dose of florfenicol followed by a second dose 48 hours later.  The test animals were sacrificed in groups of five at intervals of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days post-dosing and the following tissue samples were collected: liver, kidneys, muscle, fat, and injection sites. <p> 

7. Results:<p>
Samples were assayed using the high performance liquid chromatography determinative method described below under the section on the regulatory method. The assay of the liver samples yielded the mean values for the marker residue, florfenicol amine, shown in Table 6.7.<p>

Using these data, a withdrawal time of 28 days was calculated for use of florfenicol in cattle.  The withdrawal time was calculated using the agency's statistical tolerance limit method (99% tolerance limit with a 95% confidence interval method).<p>
 
The results of total residue study, #90714, demonstrated that residues of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone deplete to their safe concentrations in cattle by 5 days withdrawal.  Because this is less than the 28 day withdrawal for florfenicol, NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution will be regulated based on the
depletion of residues of the active ingredient florfenicol.<p>

J. Regulatory Method<p>

1. Determinative Method<p>

The determinative assay for florfenicol amine in the target tissue, liver, is a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method which provides acceptable sensitivity for the routine monitoring of florfenicol residues. Florfenicol residues (and those of related metabolites) are converted to the
marker residue, florfenicol amine, by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.  The hydrolysate is washed with ethyl acetate, centrifuged, and pH adjusted to 12.5 or greater.  The pH-adjusted solution is poured through a column and eluted with ethyl acetate.  The ethyl acetate elutes are combined and evaporated to dryness.  The dried residue is dissolved in buffer (10 mMolar potassium phosphate, pH 4.0, containing 1% (v/v) acetonitrile), filtered and analyzed by HPLC.<p>

2. Display of the Method<p>

The validated regulatory method for detection of residues of florfenicol is filed in the Food additives Analytical Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857.<p>

K. User Safety<p>

Florfenicol, with an oral LD50 in rats of &#62; 2000 mg/kg is classified as slightly hazardous via the oral route.  Dermal exposure of 0.5 cc of florfenicol powder (moistened with saline) was shown to be non-irritating to rabbit skin.  Ocular exposure of 0.1 cc of florfenicol powder in the rabbit eye
was considered essentially non-irritating with slight conjunctival redness at 24 hours  post-injection.<p>

 User safety concerns associated with the accidental injection or direct contact have been  satisfactorily addressed by establishing label warnings.  In addition, a toll-free telephone number will be available on the label to inform users of where they can obtain additional information concerning user safety relative to the MSDS and to report adverse events.<p>

<b>	VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>

The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR Part 514 of the implementing regulations.  The data demonstrate that NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution is effective for the treatment of bovine  respiratory disease when administered intramuscularly as two injections of 20 mg florfenicol per kilogram body weight, 48-hours apart.<p>

Based on a battery of toxicology tests, the safe concentrations for total florfenicol-related residues are 2.0 ppm in muscle, 6.0 ppm in liver, 12.0 ppm in kidney, and 12.0 ppm in fat.  Based on metabolism studies in cattle, a tolerance (Rm) of 3.7 ppm for the marker residue, florfenicol amine, has been established in liver.  The tolerance (Rm) refers to the residue measured by the regulatory method described herein.<p>

A pre-slaughter withdrawal period of 28 days was calculated from a residue depletion study of florfenicol residues in cattle, following the administration of NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution.  The withdrawal was based on a statistical analysis of the depletion data, using an upper tolerance limit containing 99 percent of the population with a 95 percent confidence limit.<p>

Labeling restricts this drug to use by or on order of a licensed veterinarian. This decision was based on the following factors:  (a) the product contains a new antimicrobial entity intended only for therapeutic purposes, (b) adequate directions cannot be written to enable lay persons to appropriately diagnose and subsequently use this product to treat bovine respiratory disease,
and (c) the frequency of violative tissue residues and possible emergence of resistant organisms will be reduced by the involvement of veterinarians in product use.<p>

The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that and environmental impact statement is not required.  The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and the evidence supporting that finding are contained in an environmental assessment,
which may be seen in the Docket Management Branch (HFV-305), Park Building (Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, Maryland 20855.<p>

Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this approval qualifies for FIVE years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any other application. NUFLOR &#174; Injectable Solution is under U.S. patent numbers #4,235,892 and #5,082,863, which expire on November&nbsp;25, 1997, and January 21, 2009, respectively.<p>

<B>PIVOTAL STUDIES</B><P>

<B>1. <i>In Vitro</i>&#160;Activity:</B><P>

Tilmicosin has an <i>in vitro</i>&#160;antibacterial spectrum that is
predominantly gram-positive with activity against certain gram-negative
microorganisms. Activity against several mycoplasma species has also been
detected. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of some of the organisms
tested are shown as follows:<P>

<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 2 columns.)</b><P>

Microorganisms              MIC (&#181;g/mL)</B>

<i>Pasteurella haemolytica </i>          3.12
<i>P. multocida  </i>                    6.25
<i>Haemophilus somnus  </i>              6.25
<i>Mycoplasma dispar </i>                0.097
<i>M. bovirhinis      </i>               0.024
<i>M. bovoculi         </i>              0.048

</pre>

Ninety-five percent of the Pasteurella haemolytica isolates were inhibited by
3.12 &#181;g tilmicosin/mL or less. Many of these isolates were resistant
to one or more different antibiotics including tetracycline.<P>

Serum and lung tissue concentrations of tilmicosin were determined in cattle
following a single subcutaneous injection of either a 5 mg or 10 mg/kg dose.
The steers weighed an average 216 kg for the 5 mg dose study (T5C768903) and
240 kg for the 10 mg dose study (T5C768902). The experimental procedures were
similar in both studies, which were conducted as follows:<P>

Three steers were assigned to each of 5 withdrawal periods of 8, 24, 48, 72 and
96 hours after dosing. All animals received a single injection of either 5 mg
or 10 mg/kg dose subcutaneously in the dorsolateral chest. At each withdrawal
period, a two dimensional measurement was made of the injection site and a
blood sample was obtained from each animal in the group. The animals were then
euthanized and the lungs removed, placed into an uniquely identified container
and stored frozen at -20 C until bioassayed. Blood samples were allowed to clot
at room temperature for three hours, centrifuged, the serums placed into
containers and frozen at -20 C until bioassayed. Serum samples were analyzed
for tilmicosin activity with a validated agar well bioassay using
<i>Micrococcus lutea</i>&#160;(ATCC 9341) as the test organism, and lung
tissue tilmicosin concentrations were determined with a validated HPLC
method.<P>

</pre>
As shown above, the serum tilmicosin activities following a single 5 or 10
mg/kg subcutaneous injection were much lower than the concentrations obtained
in lung tissues at various time periods. Tilmicosin is typical of many of the
other macrolide antibiotics, which have very large volumes of distribution and
low serum levels. Thus, even with the 10mg dose, peak serum levels rarely
exceeded 1 mcg/ml in the cattle. However, a higher concentration of tilmicosin
was obtained in lung tissues of steers given the 10 mg dose compared to the 5
mg dose and the concentration remained above the tilmicosin MIC 95% of 3.12
mcg/ml for <i>P. haemolytica</i>&#160;for at least three days.<P>

<b>3. Feedlot Trials:</b><P>

A series of six trials numbered T5C168701, T5C488702, T5C398703, T5C488704,
T5CCA8703, and T5CCA8705 utilizing a total of 228 mixed breed feedlot calves in
feedlot environments were conducted. Tilmicosin was administered subcutaneously
at levels of 0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg of body weight in order to conduct dosage
evaluation studies of tilmicosin as a single injection for the treatment of
naturally occurring bacterial pneumonia in cattle.<P>

Forty-eight mixed breed feedlot calves of both sexes, weighing on an average
179 kg and exhibiting signs of bacterial pneumonia with a temperature of 105 F,
were randomly assigned to four treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) of 12 each.
Nasal swabs were taken from each animal prior to the treatment for the
isolation of organisms. Following a single subcutaneous injection with the
respective treatments, clinical evaluation and temperature of each animal were
recorded daily for days 0-10 and day 28.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

Treatment with tilmicosin at levels in 10 and 20 mg/kg was effective in
reducing body temperature and mortality and in improving general condition
scores. Two animals died from each control group and the 5 mg/kg treated group.
The 5 mg dose did not reduce the incidence of mortality but did reduce the
temperature and improve general condition to a point intermediate to the
controls and the 10 and 20 mg/kg levels. Of the 48 nasal swabs collected for
culture isolation, only 7 samples were positive for both <i>P.
haemolytica</i>&#160;and <i>P. multocida. P. haemolytica</i>&#160;was
also isolated from 3 of the 4 lung tissue samples collected from the animals
that died during the trial. The average weight gains for the 28 days were
13.50, 76.00, 72.08 and 76.25 lbs per head for the 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg
treated animals. No unexpected reactions were observed at the injection
sites.<P>

Thirty-two mixed breed feedlot steers, weighing on an average 193 kg and
exhibiting signs of bacterial pneumonia with temperature of at least 105 F,
were randomly assigned to the four treatment groups (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) of
8 each. Nasal swabs were collected from each animal for culture isolation prior
to treatment. Following single subcutaneous injection with the respective
treatments, clinical evaluation and temperature of each animal were recorded
daily for days 1-10 and day 28.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

All treatments were effective in reducing the body temperature within 24 hours.
Mean temperature of the 20 mg/kg treated group appeared to be better than the 5
mg or 10 mg dosed animals from day 6 through 10. Four animals (1 from control,
1 from 10 mg and 2 from 20 mg groups) died during the 28 day trial period. Lung
lesion scores for all dead animals were in the severe category (&gt;20%
involved). <i>P. haemolytica</i>&#160;was isolated from the lungs of the
dead animals and <i>P. multocida</i>&#160;was isolated from only one of the
animals.<P>

<i>P. haemolytica</i>&#160;was isolated from 22 of the 32 nasal swabs taken
on day 0. <i>P. multocida</i>&#160;was also isolated from one of the 22
swabs.<P>

The average gains for the 28 days were 14.96, 16.88, 38.29 and 18.00 lbs per
head for the 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg treated groups. No unexpected reactions were
observed at the injection sites.<P>

Forty-four mixed breed feedlot heifer calves, weighing on an average 178 kg and
exhibiting clinical signs of bacterial pneumonia with a temperature of at least
105 F, were randomly assigned to four treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) of 11
each. Nasal swabs were taken from each animal for culture isolation. All
animals were given their respective subcutaneous treatments once and clinical
evaluation and temperature of each animal were recorded daily for days 0-10 and
on day 28.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

All doses of tilmicosin produced a rapid drop in body temperature from 105 F to
103 F within 24 hrs. However, after two days, the temperature of the 5 and 10
mg/kg treated animals tended to move within the same range as the controls. The
temperature in the 20 mg treated animals remained constantly below the control
animals through 10 days.<P>

One heifer died in the control group and another heifer aborted a calf in the
10 mg group. A diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia was made in the dead heifer
without any positive isolation of <i>P. haemolytica</i>. <i>P.
haemolytica</i>&#160;was isolated from 32 of the 44 nasal swabs. <i>P.
multocida</i>&#160;was also isolated from one of these 32 swabs.<P>

The average gains for the 28 days were 12.97, 15.97, 21.95 and 25.81 kg per
head for the 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg treated groups. No unexpected reactions were
observed at the injection sites.<P>

Thirty-two mixed breed feedlot steers, weighing on an average 197 kg and
exhibiting typical signs of bacterial pneumonia with temperature of at least
105 F, were randomly assigned to the four treatment groups (0, 5, 10 and 20
mg/kg) of 8 each. Nasal swabs were taken from each animal for culture
isolation. All animals were given their respective subcutaneous treatments once
and clinical evaluation and temperature of each animal were recorded daily for
day 1 through day 10 and day 28.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

All dosages of tilmicosin produced a reduction in body temperature within 24
hours and maintained this reduced temperature for 3 days. On day 4, the average
temperature of all treated and the control groups was very similar and remained
at 103 F or less for up to 28 days. One control animal died during the trial
period and the lung tissue yielded positive cultures of <i>P. haemolytica. P.
haemolytica</i>&#160;was also isolated from 8 of the 32 nasal swabs taken
on day 0. <i>P. multocida</i>&#160;was also isolated from one of the 32
swabs.<P>

The average gains for the 28 days were 12.83, 37.53, 34.70 and 28.35 kg per
head for the 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg treated groups. No adverse reactions were

Thirty-six mixed breed calves, weighing on an average 288 kg and exhibiting
typical signs of bacterial pneumonia with a temperature of at least 105 F, were
randomly assigned to the four treatment groups (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) of 9
each. Nasal swabs were collected from each animal for culture isolation on day
0. All animals were given a single subcutaneous injection of the respective
treatments and clinical evaluation and temperature of each animal were recorded
daily for day 1 through day 10 and day 28.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

All dosages of tilmicosin produced a 2-degree reduction in body temperature
within 24 hours and this lowered temperature was maintained for about 8 days
after which the temperature in both control and treated groups remained at
102-103 F during the trial period.<P>

Three control animals died between day 5 and day 10 and each showed &gt;20%
lung involvement with positive isolation of <i>P. haemolytica culture. P.
haemolytica</i>&#160;was also isolated from 10 of the 36 nasal swabs

Thirty-six mixed breed calves, weighing on an average 282 kg and all with body
temperature of 105 F, were randomly assigned to four treatments (0, 5, 10 and
20 mg/kg) of 9 each. Upon arrival, all animals were given an IBR-P13- <i>H.
somnus</i>&#160;vaccine, 8-way clostridial bacterin, ivermectin, anabolic
implant and 30 ml of a long-acting oxytetracycline injection. After 4 days,
tilmicosin treatment was initiated.<P>

Nasal swabs were collected from each animal on day 0 for culture isolation but
the samples were lost. All animals were then given a single subcutaneous
injection of the assigned treatments and clinical evaluation and temperature of
each animal were recorded daily for days 1-10 and day 28.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

The mean temperatures of calves treated with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dosages of
tilmicosin for days 1-10 were lower than the control group of animals. Mean
temperatures of calves treated with 10 and 20 mg doses were similar but that of
calves treated with the 5 mg dose were intermediate between these and the
controls.<P>

Five animals died during the trial, four from the control and one from the 5 mg
treated group. Each of the 5 dead animals had severe lung lesion score (20%
involved). Three additional animals became chronic during the trial and were
euthanized on day 28. One of these (a control, #2746) had bovine viral
diarrhea, another (a 5 mg treated animal, #2687) had pneumonia, and the other
(a 10 mg treated animal, #2730) had pneumonia and myocarditis. The average gain
for the 30 days were 6.75, 29.86, 35.00 and 38.78 kg per head for the 0, 5, 10
and 20 mg/kg treated groups. The average gains for the control was determined
from the four animals that were alive when the final weight was taken.<P>

There was a significant injection site reaction particularly to high doses.
However, the injection site swelling had virtually disappeared by day 7.<P>

The lungs of the necropsied animals that died had acute fibrinous pneumonia
lesions<br>
which yielded positive isolation of <i>P. haemolytica</i>.<P>

Thirty-six mixed breed calves, weighing on an average 291 kg and with a
temperature of at least 105 F, were randomly assigned to four treatment groups
(0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) of 9 each. Upon arrival, animals were given an
IBR-PI3-<i>H. somnus</i>&#160;vaccine, 8-way clostridial bacterin,
ivermectin, anabolic implant and 30 ml of a long-acting oxytetracycline
injection. After 6 days, tilmicosin treatment was initiated.<P>

Nasal swabs were collected from each animal on day 0 for culture isolation but
the samples were lost. All animals were then given a single subcutaneous
injection of tilmicosin and clinical evaluation and temperature were recorded
daily for days 1-10 and day 28.<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

All treatments were effective in lowering the body temperature within 24 hours
and preventing mortality from <i>P. haemolytica</i>&#160;infection. Mean
temperatures of all three treatments were very similar.<P>

Three animals died in the control group with fibrinous pneumonia while none
died in the 5 and 20 mg/kg treated groups. One animal in the 10 mg group died
from peritonitis. The three dead animals had severe lung lesions (20% involved)
with positive isolation of <i>P. haemolytica</i>&#160;cultures.<P>

The average gains for the 28 days were 24.83, 28.89, 41.63 and 40.89 kg per
head for the 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg treated groups. Higher doses of tilmicosin
produced injection site swelling which disappeared by day 5 or 6.<P>

<b>Conclusions:</b><P>

Of the three dosages of tilmicosin evaluated as a single subcutaneous injection
in eight clinical field trials, the 10 and the 20 mg/kg dosages were equally
effective and somewhat more efficacious than the 5 mg/kg dose in naturally
occurring pneumonia caused by <i>P. haemolytica</i>&#160;in the cattle. The
higher levels reduced the body temperature more than the lower dose during the
10 day post-treatment period and also prevented mortality and improved weight
gain during the entire 28 days of the trial. The results indicate that in cases
where the infection would be more severe than it was in these trials, cattle
treated with the lower dose (5 mg/kg) would have a higher incidence of
mortality and reduced weight gain than those treated with either of the higher
doses (10 or 20 mg/kg). That the 5 mg dose was suboptimal in these field trials
is further supported by the results of a tissue residue depletion study in
steer in which the 5 mg dose given as a single subcutaneous injection produced
tilmicosin concentration in lung tissues slightly greater than the minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3.12 mcg/ml for <i>P.
haemolytica</i>&#160;and maintained it for about 36 hours. The 10 mg dose,
also given as a single subcutaneous injection, produced a lung tilmicosin
concentration more than double the MIC of <i>P. haemolytica</i>&#160;within
24 hours and the concentration gradually declined but remained above the MIC
for 72 hours. Since lung is the target organ for
<i>Pasteurella</i>&#160;infection in cattle, the use of a single 5 mg/kg
dose subcutaneously to control the infection can not be clinically supported.
Therefore, based on the MICs of <i>Pasteurella</i>&#160;spp, the
concentration of tilmicosin in lung tissues and the efficacy data of tilmicosin
in steers, a single subcutaneous injection of 10 mg tilmicosin/kg body weight
is the optimum effective dose for the treatment of pneumonia in cattle caused
by <i>P. haemolytica</i>.<P>

<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY</b><P>

Three target animal (cattle) safety studies were conducted to address the
safety of and tolerance to tilmicosin. Based on the results of these studies,
tilmicosin is safe when administered subcutaneously at doses up to 50 mg (5X
the recommended dose) tilmicosin per kg body weight once every third day for
three injections. Local swelling reaction at the site of injection is deemed
transient and not detrimental to the safety of a sick animal.<P>

to tissue damage and edema at the injection site. Neither change was considered
to be of toxicological importance. No treatment-related changes occurred in
glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, sodium
potassium, inorganic phosphorus, cholesterol, globulin or chloride.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Organ Weights:<dl>
<dt>Both the absolute organ weights and the organ weights relative to body
weight were normal for all organs weighed including kidney, liver, heart,
adrenal, and thyroid (with parathyroids).</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Pathology:<dl>
<dt>Subcutaneous edema occurred at the injection sites in all treated cattle.
The only gross or histopathologic evidence of toxicity in tilmicosin-treated
cattle was focal myocardial necrosis of the left papillary muscle in two of
eight high-dose (50 mg/kg) cattle.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Conclusion:<dl>
<dt>Clinically, no evidence of toxicity was observed. There were no compound-
related adverse effects on body weight, feed utilization efficiency,
hematology, clinical chemistry or organ weight parameters studied.</dl></dl><br>
The most prominent treatment related changes consisted of dose-related slight
to marked swelling at the injection sites characterized histologically as
noninflammatory subcutaneous edema and sometimes accompanied by necrosis of
small areas of adjacent skeletal muscle. In the high dose group (50 mg
tilmicosin/kg body weight), two of the eight animals histologically
demonstrated small foci of myocardial necrosis in the papillary muscle as a
sign of toxicity. Otherwise, except for the injection site edema, no other
gross toxicity was observed in animals given three injections of 50 mg/kg dose
(5X the recommended dose).<P>

<b>Purpose:</b><P>

The acute effects of large doses of tilmicosin in feeder cattle were
demonstrated<br>
in this two week study.<P>

<b>Study Number</b>: VX8701<p>
<b>Species and Strain</b>: Cattle, Hereford<p>
<b>Weight</b>: Heifers: 197 to 227 kg, Steers: 204 to 208 kb<p>
<b>Number per group</b>: Placebo group (one male and one female)<p>
<b>Treatment group</b> (two heifers and two steers)<p>
<b>Initial age</b>: Approximately 10 months<p>
<b>Dosage form</b>: Injection<p>
<b>Dosages used</b>:<P>

Placebo control and 150 mg/kg, tilmicosin (0 and 15x the
approved dose)<p>
<b>Frequency</b>: Once every other day for four treatments<p>
<b>Route of administration</b>: Subcutaneous<p>
<b>Start date</b>: April 22, 1987<p>
<b>Termination date</b>: May 6, 1987<p>
<b>Test Duration</b>: 2 weeks<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><br>

<dl>
<dt>Survival:<dl>
<dt>One heifer on the 150 mg/kg dose died approximately one hour following the
third injection. The second heifer on the 150 mg/kg dose died one hour after
the fourth injection. Both treated steers survived to termination of the
study.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Clinical Observations:<dl>
<dt>Clinical observations in treated cattle included swelling at the injection
site, reluctance to move, slight to deep depression, and mortality.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Electrocardiograms and Heart Rates:<dl>
<dt>Subcutaneously implanted electrodes connected to battery-powered
transmitters were used for radio-telemetric collection of electrocardiograms.
Recordings were made pretest, immediately prior to dosing, at 1, 4, and 24
hours post-injection and at additional times as indicated by clinical signs or
recordings at scheduled recording times. Transient tachycardia and increased
amplitude of the Q and T waves were detected after each of the four injections.
After the second and subsequent doses, the above changes developed into mild
resting bradycardia and decreased wave form amplitudes.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Body Weight:<dl>
<dt>Control cattle continued to gain weight during the study. Cattle receiving
tilmicosin lost weight due to reduced feed consumption.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Feed Consumption:<dl>
<dt>Cattle in the control group continued to consume feed at a level equivalent
to or greater than the pretest periods. Feed consumption for the cattle
receiving tilmicosin was greatly reduced following the first
injection.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Hematology:<dl>
<dt>All cattle were bled at pretreatment days 14 and 7, just prior to the
initial treatment, at 6 and 24 hours post first injection, and on test days 7
and 14 to provide blood samples for the determination of erythrocyte counts,
hemoglobin, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration,
erythrocyte morphology, total and differential leukocyte count, and thrombocyte
count. Hematologic changes included mild neutrophilia and mild
hemoconcentration. All other values were within normal ranges.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Clinical Chemistry:<dl>
<dt>Serum samples for clinical chemistry were collected at the same times as
blood samples for hematology. Minimal to slight increases in activities of the
enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) occurred
as early as six hours after the first injection. LDH values remained slightly
elevated while CPK values returned to normal at the end of the two-week study.
The isoenzyme patterns suggested that increased serum activities of LDH and CPK
were a result of skeletal muscle damage at the injection site. Serum alkaline
phosphatase activity and serum concentrations of total protein, albumin,
globulin, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, sodium, and cholesterol were mildly
decreased. These changes were compatible with decreased feed intake, combined
with massive loss of serum components into the subcutaneous tissue at the
injection sites. Values for glucose, urea nitrogen, total bilirubin,
creatinine, potassium, and sorbitol dehydrogenase were normal.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Organ Weights:<dl>
<dt>Kidney, liver heart, adrenal, and thyroid weights were determined and
evaluated for differences in absolute and organ weight relative to body weight.
The adrenal weights of the treated steers were moderately increased both on an
absolute and on a relative body weight basis. The weights for the kidney,
liver, heart, and thyroids were similar to those of the two control
animals.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Pathology:<dl>
<dt>Treatment-related gross and histopathologic changes in cattle given
multiple 150 mg/kg subcutaneous injections of tilmicosin were prominent
subcutaneous edema at the injection sites and minimal to moderate focal
myocardial necrosis of the left ventricular papillary muscle.</dl></dl><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The acute manifestations of multiple injections of large (150 mg/kg)
subcutaneous doses of tilmicosin included small foci of myocardial necrosis,
prominent noninflammatory injection site edema and some mortality. The
noninflammatory nature of the injection site edema and the absence of prominent
morphologic changes in the heart suggest that cattle that survive large doses
of tilmicosin should be expected to become clinically normal with no important
residual lesions.<P>

<b>C. AN EIGHT-DAY STUDY IN CATTLE TO DETERMINE THE ACUTE TOXICITY OF A SINGLE

<b>Termination date:</b> June 22, 1988<p>
<b>Study Director:</b> Dr. W. H. Jordan<p>
<b>Location of the Study:</b> The Elanco Products Company, Greenfield,

<b>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:</b><P>
0, 2.5, 5.0 mg/kg
administered once as a single injection.<p>
<b>Number of Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group:</b><P>
0 and 2.5 mg/kg groups:
1/sex, 5 mg/kg group: 2/sex<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b> Intravenous<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><br>

<dl>
<dt>Survival and Clinical Signs:<dl>
<dt>No mortality or clinical signs were observed in the control or low-dose
groups. Both heifers injected with the high-dose died within 10 minutes.
Increased and shallow respirations were noted in both high-dose steers, and one
steer was recumbent from 2 to 12 minutes following dosing. Both steers returned
to normal in approximately one hour.</dl></dl><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

Tilmicosin, formulated for subcutaneous injection, was tested for toxicity when
given by the intravenous route. Rapid intravenous injection of 5 mg
tilmicosin/kg body weight caused death in two of two heifers and was acutely
toxic, but nonlethal, to two of two steers. No clinical signs were observed in
cattle that received an intravenous injection of 2.5 mg of tilmicosin/kg of
body weight.<P>

<b>Investigators:</b><P>

A separate study (No. T5C769812) was conducted to generate photographic records
of the areas in the immediate vicinity of the subcutaneous injection sites.
Four Angus cross steers, weighing 425-511 kg, each received 4 subcutaneous
injections of 10 mg/kg dose of tilmicosin at different locations at weekly
intervals. The injection sites were located caudal to the shoulder and over the
last ribs on both sides in areas designated as right front, right rear, left
front and left rear. The injection schedule and locations were assigned such
that at necropsy all 4 injection locations were represented for each
post-injection period. Two weeks after the last tilmicosin injection, the
steers were sacrificed. The carcasses were hung by the hind legs and the
injection sites were exposed. Gross evaluations and photographs were made of
the internal surface of the skin over the injection site, the subcutaneous
injection site surface, and the incised subcutaneous site surface for all 16
treatment sites.<P>

The results show that subcutaneous injection of tilmicosin at 10 mg/kg dose in
feedlot cattle does not result in grossly apparent damage to either the skin or
the muscle just below the injection area by 14 days post-treatment, and that no
trimming of these injection areas would be indicated by 28 days
post-treatment.<P>

<b>VI. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><P>

<b>A. TOXICITY STUDIES</b><P>

<b>CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL</b><P>

Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals were not required to support the
use of this injectable antibiotic in domestic livestock. The absence of a
carcinogenicity study in the tilmicosin data package is consistent with a low
level of concern for carcinogenicity as defined by FDA guidelines.(1)<P>

Specific factors indicating that a carcinogenicity study was not needed for
this macrolide antibiotic included the lack of chemical structural relationship
to known carcinogens, the lack of important pathological changes in toxicity
studies, the absence of genotoxicity and anticipated low human exposure levels.
Literature searches failed to reveal any evidence of carcinogenicity due to
other macrolide antibiotics. Repeated dose toxicity studies did not produce any
signs or symptoms to suggest a potential for neoplasia. Toxicology studies were
conducted in which rats and dogs were given daily oral doses for up to 3 months
and 1 year, respectively. Although a specific target organ was not defined in
the rats, studies in dogs clearly demonstrated the heart to be the most
important target organ of toxicity for tilmicosin. The heart was subsequently
confirmed as the target organ of toxicity in cattle, pigs, and monkeys. The
cardiac effects are transient and would not be expected to lead to neoplasia.
Furthermore, no proliferative lesions attributable to the direct effects of
tilmicosin were observed in any species tested. The absence of mutagenic or
clastogenic effects in a series of well accepted tests indicated that
tilmicosin was not genotoxic and was unlikely to induce genetic effects that
might lead to neoplasia.<P>

<b>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:</b> 0, 6, 20, and 70 mg/kg/day<P>
<b>Route of Administration:</b> oral<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><br>

<dl>
<dt>Survival:<dl>
<dt>Four high-dose dogs (two/sex) died during the first month of the study. All
remaining animals survived to study termination.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Clinical Observation:<dl>
<dt>The only treatment-related clinical observations were pale mucous membranes
in a male and a female from the high-dose group prior to death. The high-dose
female was also ataxic on one occasion.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Ophthalmic Examination:<dl>
<dt>All dogs were normal pretest. All surviving dogs were examined
approximately one week prior to study termination and again one day prior to
termination. At both examinations, one male and one female high-dose dog had
bilateral multifocal areas of subretinal fluid, primarily in the tapetal
region. Although the condition was seen in each dog, there was a much greater
effect in the male than in the female. Each area was less than 1/2 disk
diameter in size. The male also had some areas of focal retinal degeneration.
Miosis was seen in the female, but with normal pupillary light responses and a
normal response to the mydriatic. There was virtually no change in either dog's
condition during the re-examination near study termination. The remaining dogs
had no treatment-related changes.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Physical Examination:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related effects were observed during the physical examination
conducted at study termination.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Electrocardiograms:<dl>
<dt>Daily doses of 6 mg/kg showed no significant electrocardiographic effects,
doses of 20 mg/kg produced moderate to severe tachycardia; and daily doses of
70 mg/kg caused very severe and possibly lethal tachycardia and a significant
sag (depression) in the ST segment.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Body Weight:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related changes were observed during the study.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Food Consumption:<dl>
<dt>Treatment with tilmicosin did not affect the quantity of food
consumed.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Hematology<dl>
<dt>Hematology samples were collected during weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and at
termination. No treatment-related effects were detected for leukocyte count,
erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, erythrocyte indices,
thrombocyte count, leukocyte differential, erythrocyte morphophology, or
activated partial thromboplastin time.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Bone Marrow:<dl>
<dt>The bone marrow evaluation including estimated M:E ratios of bone marrow
smears was normal for all dogs at termination.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Clinical Chemistry:<dl>
<dt>Serum samples were collected during weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and at termination.
Values for glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, and alkaline
phosphatase were normal. Serum alanine transaminase for high-dose dogs of both
sexes was increased by day 12 and continued to increase to termination of the
study.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Urinalysis:<dl>
<dt>Parameters evaluated for urine collected from each dog during the study and
at termination included color, clarity, pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose,
occult blood, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen. Urinalysis data from
treated animals did not differ from those of control dogs.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>A significant increase in mean activity of p-nitroanisole O-demethylase was
observed in the high-dose group females. There was no effect on enzyme
induction in males.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Serum Concentration of Tilmicosin:<dl>
<dt>The serum content of tilmicosin during the study indicated that absorption
of the test compound was dose-related. Comparisons of the mean 3- and 24-hour
serum levels indicated that the compound was slowly eliminated from the serum
compartment. Apparent increases in the 24-hour mean serum levels were evident
for the middle- and high-dose groups through week 9; no significant increases
were evident thereafter.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Organ Weights:<dl>
<dt>Treatment-related increases in liver weights occurred in high-dose females
and in heart weights in high-dose dogs of both sexes. The significance of
slightly increased relative kidney weights in high-dose females was not
apparent. The treatment did not affect the weights of the adrenal glands,
thyroids, ovaries, testes, or brain.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Pathologic Findings:<dl>
<dt>There were neither gross nor microscopic lesions to explain the cause of
death in the four high-dose dogs that died during the study. Upon gross
examination, the heart was found to be slightly enlarged in one terminally
killed high-dose male. Histologically, mild diffuse mucosal edema occurred in
the gall bladders of one high-dose dog of each sex. No additional
treatment-related changes were observed.</dl></dl><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

Daily oral administration of tilmicosin at a dose of 70 mg/kg for three months
resulted in the deaths of four of eight dogs. Dogs that survived doses of 20 to
70 mg/kg sustained moderate to severe tachycardia without clinical pathologic
or morphologic evidence of permanent tissue damage. The no-observed-effect
level for daily oral administration of tilmicosin was 6 mg/kg (3 mg/kg BID).<P>

<dl>
<dt>Clinical Chemistry:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related effects were detected for serum concentrations of
glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin or activities of the
enzymes alkaline phosphatase and alanine transaminase.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Urinalysis:<dl>
<dt>The pH of the urine from high-dose females was slightly lower than that of
controls and a slight increase in occult blood was noted for high-dose rats of
both sexes. Parameters considered normal included color, clarity, protein,
glucose, specific gravity, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Enzyme Induction:<dl>
<dt>No significant increases in mean activity of p-nitroanisole O-demethylase
were observed at any of the dose levels tested in this study.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Organ Weights:<dl>
<dt>Moderate increases in adrenal weights were noted for middle-dose males and
high-dose rats of both sexes. Absolute or relative weights were also increased
for hearts, kidneys, and livers of middle- and high-dose rats. Weights for the
thyroid (with parathyroid), prostate, testis, ovary, uterus, spleen, and brain
were considered either to be within normal limits or changed due to the poor
body condition of high-dose males.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Pathologic Findings:<dl>
<dt>Grossly, high-dose and a few middle-dose rats appeared thin and had other
nonspecific changes such as dehydration, nasal discharge and decreased size of
the spleen. Histologically, tilmicosin at a dose of 1000 mg/kg was associated
with minimal to moderate hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal and
a low incidence of myocardial degeneration and skeletal muscle necrosis.
Despite some deaths at a dose of 250 mg/kg, no morphologic evidence of toxicity
was found at this dose. No evidence of toxicity was found in low (50 mg/kg)
dose rats.</dl></dl><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

Daily oral gavage of tilmicosin doses of 250 and 1000 mg/kg were toxic to
Crl:CD(SD) rats as demonstrated by increased mortality and organ weight and

<dl>
<dt>Parental Mortality and Necropsy Findings:<dl>
<dt>There were 2, 1, 8, and 8 deaths of the F0 males, F0 females, F1 males, and
F1 females, respectively. The death of the one F0 female of the 200 mg/kg/day

18, 19, and 21, from the control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups,
respectively. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations and the
proportions of live fetuses and resorptions were not affected by treatment with
tilmicosin. There were no dead fetuses in this study.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Fetal Parameters:<dl>
<dt>Fetal sex ratios, fetal body weights, the proportions of fetal runts, and
the proportions of fetuses with developmental variations, deviations, or
malformations were not affected by treatment. Male or female fetal body weights
were significantly elevated in litters of dams given 500 mg/kg/day; however,
the elevation was interpreted to be unrelated to tilmicosin treatment because
it was slight and exaggerated by the atypically low weights of control fetuses
in comparison to recent historical control data. The proportion of male fetuses
with developmental deviations was significantly elevated in litters of dams
given 10 mg/kg/day. However, these deviations were interpreted to be unrelated
to tilmicosin treatment because there was no dose-response relationship, and
the incidence of each type of deviation was in close agreement with recent
historical control data.</dl></dl><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
Based on a depression of body weight gain during the first half of the
treatment period, the no-observed-effect level for tilmicosin maternal toxicity
in the rat was 10 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of embryo/fetal toxicity or
teratogenicity related to tilmicosin treatment up to 500 mg/kg/day, the highest
dose tested.<P>

<b>Starting date:</b> September 29, 1987<p>
<b>Termination date:</b> March 1, 1989<p>
<b>Study Director:</b> Dr. W. H. Jordan<p>
<b>Location of the Study:</b> The Elanco Products Company, Greenfield,
Indiana<p>
<b>Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:</b> Tilmicosin, oral powder in
capsules<p>
<b>Species and Strain:</b> Dog, Beagle<p>
<b>Number of Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group:</b> Four/sex/group<p>
<b>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:</b><P>0, 4, 12, and 36 mg/kg/day
total dose divided for twice a day administration for one year<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b> Oral<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><br>

<dl>
<dt>Dose Administration:<dl>
<dt>The compound was administered orally twice-daily (b.i.d.) as equally
divided doses separated by a minimum of five hours. Each dog was offered 120 g
of food approximately one hour prior to each of the two daily dose
administrations. A visual estimation of the amount of food consumed was made
after the dogs had access to the food for one hour. Only the dogs that had
consumed at least one-half of the food were administered a dose. The same
dosing/feeding regimen was repeated a minimum of five hours later for the
second daily dose. There were sporadic occasions in each treatment group in
which the first and/or second daily doses were not administered because of
insufficient food consumption. The number of dogs affected and the total number
of these occasions were similar between the control, low-, and middle-dose
groups. Instances of dogs not being dosed due to insufficient food consumption
were slightly lower in the high- dose group.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Survival:<dl>
<dt>All animals survived to the scheduled termination of the study.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Clinical Observations:<dl>
<dt>No toxicologically important clinical observations were detected in
tilmicosin-treated dogs. Peripheral redness, first observed at five-months,
consisted of redness of the ventral aspect of the pinna and occasionally the
muzzle and/or abdomen. Peripheral redness was observed sporadically, in all
tilmicosin-treated groups, during the last seven months of the study, but was
always mild and was considered to be of no toxicological importance.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Ophthalmic Examinations:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related ophthalmic changes were observed during the
study.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Physical Examinations:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related effects were detected.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Electrocardiograms:<dl>
<dt>An increased incidence of moderate to marked heart rate increases was
detected in six of eight high-dose dogs. In the latter half of the study, the
positive chronotropic effect in three of the dogs was accompanied by sporadic
instances of ST segment depression. There was no evidence of tilmicosin-induced
disturbances in cardiac rhythm or conduction in high-dose dogs and no evidence
of tilmicosin-induced cardiotoxicity in mid- and low-dose dogs.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Body Weight:<dl>
<dt>Although all dogs gained weight at approximately the same rate for the
first three to four months of the study, the body weight gains for the middle-
and high-dose dogs were slightly to moderately less than those of control and
low-dose animals during the last eight months of the 12-month study. These
differences were slightly greater and occurred earlier for females than for
males.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Food Consumption:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related effects on food consumption were observed during the
study. There were sporadic occasions when doses were not administered because
of insufficient food consumption; however, the total ration was consumed during
each 24 hour period.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Hematology:<dl>
<dt>No toxicologically important changes occurred in erythrocyte count,
hemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, mean
corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte
morphology, total and differential leukocyte counts, thrombocyte count, or
activated partial thromboplastin time. Bone marrow cytology evaluation,
including an estimated M:E ratio, was also normal.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Clinical Chemistry:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related changes occurred in serum glucose, blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine
transaminase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine
phosphokinase, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, sodium, potassium, chloride,
cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, globulin, or
albumin/globulin ratio.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Urinalysis:<dl>
<dt>No treatment-related changes occurred in urine color, clarity, specific
gravity, pH, protein, glucose, occult blood, ketones, bilirubin, or
urobilinogen.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Organ Weights:<dl>
<dt>Organs weighed at necropsy included: kidney, liver, heart, lungs, spleen,
thymus, salivary glands, ovaries, uterus, testes, prostate, adrenals, thyroids
with parathyroids, pituitary, and brain. The absolute and relative heart
weights of high-dose males and relative heart weights of high-dose females were
increased relative to controls. No additional treatment-related effects on
organ weights were detected.</dl></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Pathology:<dl>
<dt>Upon gross examination, the hearts of four males and one female from the
high-dose group were found to be slightly dilated, but were histologically
normal. Mild dermatitis in treated dogs was judged to be of no toxicologic
importance.</dl></dl><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
Oral tilmicosin doses of 12 or 36 mg/kg/day given as twice-daily divided doses
for one year caused slightly depressed body weight gains and, at the 36 mg/kg
dose, an increased incidence of tachycardia and mild ST segment depression in
electrocardiograms. The no-observed-effect level was 4 mg/kg/day.<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><P>

Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in hepatocytes was quantified. The number of
silver grains over the cell nucleus was counted. The net nuclear grain count
represents the difference between the gross nuclear grain count and the mean
cytoplasmic background grain count. Nuclei of 20 morphologically unaltered
cells, judged to be representative of the UDS responsiveness of the cell
population and containing at least four grains, were counted for each
treatment. Autoradiographic grain counts were conducted for the highest
compound concentration that did not produce pronounced cytotoxicity and for all
lower concentrations of the test compound.<P>

<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

Cytoxicity resulted from treatment with tilmicosin at concentrations of 1000,
500, 100, and 50 &#181;g/mL. No induction of UDS was observed at concentrations of
10, 5, 1, and 0.5 &#181;g/mL. These observations were noted in both studies.<P>

The cultured adult rat hepatocytes were sensitive to the induction of UDS both
by the positive controls MNNG and 2AAF, and tilmicosin was inactive for the
induction of UDS.<P>

<b>Route of Administration:</b> cell culture perfusion<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><P>

In this <i>in vitro</i>&#160;forward mutation assay, mutagenic agents
induce the heritable loss of Thymidine kinase (TK) activity in formerly TK
competent L5178Y cells (TK +/-). The resulting L5178Y TK -/- mutants lack the
salvage enzyme thymidine kinase and are therefore detected by their resistance
to the lethal thymidine analogs 5-bromodeoxyuridine or trifluorothymidine. Rat
liver microsomal enzymes (S9) have been incorporated into this test for the
activation of mutagenicity.<P>

L5178Y (TK +/-) mouse lymphoma cells were treated <i>in vitro</i>&#160;with
tilmicosin to evaluate mammalian cell point-mutation. The test was conducted
with and without metabolic activation by an S9 liver microsomal fraction
obtained from Aroclor 1254-induced rats. To confirm the responsiveness of the
test, ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) and 3- methylcholanthrene (3MC) were also
tested and served as positive controls.<P>

<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

In the nonactivated test, concentrations of 900 &#181;g/ml and 800
&#181;g/ml were not evaluated for mutagenicity due to cytotoxicity. All
concentrations in the activated test were evaluated. In the nonactivated test,
the percent survival ranged from 19% to 99% and the mutation index ranged from
0.4 to 0.9. In the activated test the percent survival ranged from 61% to 99%
and the mutation index ranged from 0.5 to 1.2. No mutagenicity was observed at
any dose with or without activation. This system was sensitive to the positive
controls as evidenced by the positive responses observed with EMS and 3MC, and
tilmicosin was not mutagenic to L5178Y TK+/- cells, with or without metabolic
activation.<P>

Tilmicosin was tested <i>in vitro</i>&#160;for the induction of mammalian
cell mutation in the HGPRT+ Chinese hamster ovary cell assay with and without
liver microsomal activation. The assay used is a modified method. Cells are
maintained in suspension for exposure of the compound and then plated in
soft-agar for selection of mutants. EMS and 3MC served as positive controls for
the nonactivated and activated assays, respectively.<P>

<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

In the nonactivated test, the highest concentration of tilmicosin (250 &#181;g/ml)
was not evaluated for mutagenicity due to cytotoxicity. In the activated test,
concentrations of 275 &#181;g/ml and 300 &#181;g/ml were not evaluated due to
cytotoxicity. In the nonactivated test, the percent survival ranged from 15% to
89% and the mutation index ranged from 0.0 to 1.7. In the activated test, the
percent survival ranged from 7% to 98% and the mutation index ranged from 0.2
to 1.1. No treatment, whether nonactivated or activated, showed any evidence of
induced mutation. This system was sensitive to both EMS and 3MC as evidenced by
the induction of mutants. Tilmicosin was not mutagenic in HGPRT+ Chinese
hamster ovary cells, with or without metabolic activation.<P>

<b>Identification of Substance and Dosage Form:</b> Tilmicosin, solution<p>
<b>Species and Stratin: </b>Rats, Sprague-Dawley<p>
<b>Number of Animals Per Sex Treatment Group:</b> 5 males and 5 females were
used per treatment group<p>
<b>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing:</b><P>180, 600, and 1800 mg/kg

mg/kg, respectively.<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b> oral gavage<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><P>

Tilmicosin was tested to evaluate whether it or its metabolites could interact
with the chromosomes from rat bone marrow cells to produce gross lesions (the
acute dosage) and whether these changes were of a type which could survive more
than one mitotic cycle of the cell (the subchronic dosage). All aberration
figures detected by these assays would have resulted from breaks in the
chromatin, which either failed to repair or were repaired in atypical
combination. The cell transit time for bone marrow is normally 10-14 hours. The
assay designs were such that bone marrow samples were taken at 6, 18, and 30
hrs after a single dose of tilmicosin in the acute study and 6 hrs after the
last 5 daily doses of tilmicosin in the subchronic study. The rationale for
harvesting bone marrow at 30 hrs in the acute study was for detection of
chromosome aberrations in cells that may have been delayed in their progression
through the mitotic cycle.<P>

<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

The test article, tilmicosin, was considered negative for inducing chromosomal
aberrations in bone marrow cells of both male and female rats under the acute
and subchronic dosing conditions of this assay. The acute dose of 1800 mg/kg
approximated 80% of the median lethal dose in nonfasted rats.<P>

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><P>

Tilmicosin was tested in vivo for the induction of sister chromatid exchange
(SCE) in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. Cyclophosphamide was administered as
the positive control for this study. Ten percent aqueous acacia, the vehicle
used for tilmicosin suspensions, was used as the negative control.<P>

In order to achieve the sister chromatid differentiation necessary to score
SCE, a bromodeoxyuridine tablet was implanted in each hamster. Five hours later
tilmicosin and the positive and negative controls were administered.
Approximately 19 hr later, animals were killed, bone marrow was harvested from
the femurs, and slides were prepared, stained, and scored for SCE.<P>

<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

The in vivo assay for SCE formation was sensitive to the positive control,
cyclophosphamide, and tilmicosin was inactive for the induction of SCE in
Chinese hamster bone marrow at a dose that approximated 50% of the median

<b>Parameters Studied and Results:</b><P>

Tilmicosin was tested in the Ames assay for the induction of bacterial mutation
using five histidine auxotrophs of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>.
Concentrations of 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1 &#181;g/plate of tilmicosin were
tested with and without metabolic activation using an S9 fraction prepared from
the livers of Aroclor 1254-induced rats. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
(MNNG), 2-nitrofluorene (2NF), and 9-aminoacridine (9AmAc) served as the
positive controls for the nonactivated test, while 2-aminoanthracene (2AA)
served as the positive control for the activated test. Dimethyl sulfoxide, the
solvent for tilmicosin, served as the negative control, with and without
metabolic activation.<P>

<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

Treatment with MNNG, 2NF, 9AmAc, and 2AA resulted in a dose-related induction
of reverse mutations in the appropriate Salmonella tester strains in the
nonactivated and activated tests. Treatment with tilmicosin resulted in
concentration-related decreases in counts of reverent colonies in all tester
strains, both with and without metabolic activation. This was considered a
manifestation of the antibacterial properties of the compound. Concentrations
of &lt;=10 &#181;g/plate yielded survival values &gt;=30 percent in all
tester strains under both activation conditions and informative reverent
frequency data were confined to concentrations of 10, 5 and 1
&#181;g/plate. Over this concentration range, treatment with tilmicosin did
not result in the induction of Salmonella reverent with or without activation.
Tilmicosin was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome test

</pre>
Livers from cattle in the residue study described above were subjected to wet
chemistry procedures to establish the profile of 14C-tilmicosin metabolites
present. The approach involved solvent extractions followed by thin layer
chromatography (TLC), autoradiography, and high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).<P>

At three days withdrawal, approximately 86% of the 14C-tilmicosin residues
present in cattle liver was freely extractable into methanol/water (80/20). By
56 days post dosing, 57% of the residues were extractable.<P>

The extraction and fractionation of the radiolabeled residues in liver tissue
demonstrated that there were three primary components of the liver tissue. At
three days withdrawal parent tilmicosin and compounds designated as T-1 and T-2
represented 33.7%, 16.0% and 8.7% of the liver radioactivity respectively. At
28 days, that distribution changed to 7%, 5%, and 21%. Metabolites T-1 and T-2
were isolated and characterized through mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear
magnetic resonance analysis (NMR). Those data showed a molecular weight of 854
for metabolite T-1 and indicated that it is N-desmethyl tilmicosin with the
change in structure on the mycaminose sugar.<P>

Metabolite T-2 was found by comparative HPLC to be identical with an impurity
known to be present in the tilmicosin bulk active ingredient. This impurity had
a molecular weight of 1609 and consisted of components of two macrolide and one
piperidine ring. Compound T-2 is considered to be a dimer of tilmicosin and not
a likely metabolite. Its presence as a residue in liver tissue is probably due
to its presence in the injected drug rather than due to metabolism of
tilmicosin.<P>

One minor metabolite (T-3) was isolated from cattle feces. This metabolite was
closely related to tilmicosin and appeared to result from replacement of the
dimethylamino group on the mycaminose sugar with a hydroxyl group. Metabolic
profiles of tilmicosin residues in the urine, feces and livers of orally dosed
rats were also determined using similar extraction procedures. The resulting
HPLC chromatograms indicated that the rat had been exposed to the same
metabolites as those found in cattle. The HPLC assays of the rat liver and
urine indicated that little if any T-2 was present. Similar data had been
collected for orally dosed swine.<P>

<b>D. Selection of Target Tissue and Marker Residue for Tilmicosin in
Cattle</b><P>

The data in the table residue values shown above establish that liver contains
the highest levels of total drug related residues of tilmicosin and that it is
the tissue in cattle from which residues are the slowest to deplete to the safe
concentration. These observations suggested liver as the likely choice of
target tissue for tilmicosin in cattle.<P>

The metabolism data, summarized in Section C., confirmed liver as the target
tissue and led to the selection of the parent tilmicosin as the marker
substance. Those data demonstrated that the parent was present in sufficiently
high concentration and had the proper depletion characteristics in liver to
serve as the marker residue in that tissue.<P>

<b>E. Tolerance for the Marker Residue</b><P>

The Rm (tolerance) for tilmicosin was set from data obtained from the analysis
of liver tissue from cattle in the total residue study described in Section C.
The livers from cattle in that study were assayed for parent tilmicosin by the
determination assay of the regulatory method. The method involves an initial
extraction of the tissues with methanol. The extracts are further partitioned
with carbon tetrachloride and chloroform. The resulting residue is then
dissolved in the HPLC mobile phase for HPLC analysis by UV detection at 280 nm
as discussed in Section G.<P>

The results demonstrated that at 3 days withdrawal the parent compound
represented 34% (6.61 ppm) of the total residue in liver. At 14 and 28 days
withdrawal, the parent compound represented 17.1% (1.991 ppm) and 6.6% (0.377
ppm) of the total residue respectively. By plotting the linear regression of
the residue depletion data for the total and marker residues, it was determined
that when the total residues depleted to the safe concentration (9.6 ppm), the
marker residue reached a value of 1.2 ppm. Therefore, the Rm was established as
1.2 ppm.<P>

<b>F. Study Establishing the Withdrawal Period</b><P>

Depletion of the marker residue following the subcutaneous administration of
tilmicosin was determined in a study utilizing 12 head of cattle (8 males, 4
females). Each animal received a single dose at 10 mg/kg. The cattle were
euthanized in groups of three (two steers and one heifer per group) at 14, 28,
35 and 42 days post-dosing.<P>

Liver, kidney, muscle, fat and injection site samples were collected at the
time of slaughter and assayed for the marker residue using the determinative
procedure. The results are presented in the table below.<P>

</pre>
A statistical analysis of the depletion data, using an upper tolerance limit
containing 99 percent of the population with a 95% confidence limit, supported
a withdrawal period of 28 days. As a result, a withdrawal period of 28 days has
been established for the injectable form of tilmicosin used as a single
subcutaneous injection at 10 mg/kg.<P>

<b>G. Regulatory Method</b><P>

Tilmicosin Determinative Assay Procedure<P>

The determinative assay for measuring tilmicosin residues in treated cattle
consists of extraction of the parent drug from liver, and measurement of the
parent drug in the extract by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<P>

Ground cattle liver is homogenized with methanol and centrifuged to separate
the solids. The methanol extract is diluted with sodium chloride solution,
partitioned with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and the CCl4 layer is discarded.
The aqueous methanol phase is made basic with sodium carbonate solution, and
tilmicosin is extracted into chloroform/hexane. The chloroform/hexane extract
is evaporated to dryness, and the residue is reconstituted in a solution of
dibutylammonium phosphate in aqueous methanol. This solution is analyzed by
HPLC, using a reversed-phase phenylsilyl stationary column and a three-solvent
gradient, with detection at 280 nm.<P>

The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method is 0.1 ppm.<P>

<b>Tilmicosin Confirmatory Assay Procedure</b><P>

In the confirmatory procedure, a sample is processed as above, through the
point at which the chloroform/hexane extract is evaporated. The residue from
that evaporation is then dissolved in chloroform, applied to a silica gel
cartridge, and washed with chloroform/ methanol. Tilmicosin is eluted from the
column with chloroform/ methanol/ ammonium hydroxide, and the solution is
evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in methanol and analyzed by
tandem liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry
procedure involves selective ion monitoring for three ions characteristic of
tilmicosin.<P>

<b>Method Validation</b><P>

A method trial of the determinative and confirmatory assays was satisfactorily
completed by FDA and USDA laboratories.<P>

<b>Method Location</b><P>

The validated regulatory analytical methods for tilmicosin residues are on
display in Dockets Management Branch (HFV-305), Park Building (room 1-23),
12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20855. They are attached to the FOI
summary. They will be filed in the Animal Drug Analytical Manual.<P>

<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>

The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR Part 514 of the implementing
regulations. The data demonstrate that tilmicosin (MicotilR 300), a macrolide
antibiotic, when administered to cattle by a single subcutaneous injection at
10 mg/kg, is safe and effective for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease
(BRD) associated with <i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i>.<P>

A tolerance is established for total tilmicosin residues in edible cattle
tissues based on a marker residue concentration of 1.2 ppm parent
(unmetabolized) tilmicosin in the target tissue (liver). A parent tilmicosin
concentration of 1.2 ppm in liver corresponds to a safe concentration of total
tilmicosin residues of 9.6 ppm in liver. The other respective safe
concentrations are: 4.8 ppm in muscle, 14.4 ppm in kidney, and 19.2 ppm in fat.
A regulatory analytical method has been developed to determine the
concentration and confirm the identity of tilmicosin in liver at 1.2 ppm.<P>

A withdrawal period of 28 days has been established for tilmicosin used as a
single subcutaneous injection at 10 mg/kg dosage based on a statistical
analysis of the depletion data, using an upper tolerance limit containing 99
percent of the population with a 95% confidence limit.<P>

Labeling restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed
veterinarian. This decision was based on the following factors: (a) the product
contains a new antimicrobial entity intended only for therapeutic purposes, (b)
adequate directions can not be written to enable laypersons to appropriately
diagnose and subsequently use this product to treat bovine respiratory disease
associated with <i>Pasteurella haemolytica</i>, (c) intravenous drug
administration is lethal to cattle, (d) higher doses are toxic to swine and
monkeys and can cause death, with the cardiovascular system being the target of
toxicity, and (e) there is a potential danger to the person administering the
product if it is accidentally self injected or to other persons if it is
accidentally injected. Because of these effects, extensive warning and caution
statements are provided in the labeling which are deemed to be adequate to
protect users from accidental injection and to discourage extralabel use.<P>

The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this
action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and the
evidence supporting that finding are contained in an environmental assessment
which may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFV- 305), Park Building
(Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20855.<P>

Section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the act provides a five-year exclusivity period for
a drug, no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active
ingredient) of which has been approved in any other application under
subsequent (b)(1). This NADA qualifies for such an exclusivity period.
Tilmicosin is under patent number U.S. 4,820,695 expiring April 11, 2006.<P>

	<B>4.     Effectiveness</B><p>

The effectiveness of oxfendazole suspensions (9.06% and 22.5%) was extensively 
evaluated in cattle and adequately described in the FOI summary of the 
approved NADA 140-854 (copy attached).  In addition, two dose confirmation-
comparison trials were evaluated.   These trials were conducted to demonstrate 
that the approved suspension formulations and the paste formulation had 
similar biological effectiveness (bioavailability end points) in removing the 
parasites listed on the labels of the approved formulations.  The approved 
suspension formulations and the paste formulation were administered at the 
same dosage levels (4.5 mg/kg) and compared to support approval of the paste 
formulation.  The efficacy was calculated as follows:<p>

The results indicate that the paste formulation provides identical biological 
results against the parasites as the two approved formulations.<p>

Conclusion<p>

The results from the two confirmation-comparison trials indicate that the oral 
paste formulation has the same biological anthelmintic effectiveness against 
the major gastrointestinal parasites as the oral suspension and the 
intraruminal injection dosage forms.   Therefore, it is concluded on the basis 
of clinical veterinary medical judgment that the results of the two studies 
support the same claims of efficacy for the paste formulation as that of the 
oral suspension and intraruminal injection formulations provided in NADA 140-
854.<p>

<B>5.	Target Species Safety
</B><p>
The safety of oxfendazole was extensively evaluated in cattle and the results 
described in the FOI summary of the approved NADA 140-854 are applicable to 
this application.<p>

<B>6.     Human Food Safety</B><p>

The human food safety aspects of oxfendazole were extensively evaluated and 
described in the FOI summary, Sections 6.A. to 6.F. and 6.H., of approved NADA 
140-854.  However, the 7-day withdrawal time mentioned in Section 6.E. of the 
FOI summary of NADA 140-854 was specific for the suspension dosage form of 
oxfendazole, and a separate withdrawal study (IAS 1134-953) was conducted in 
order to determine a withdrawal time for the 18.5% oxfendazole paste 
formulation.<p>

Withdrawal Time (Study IAS 1134-953)<p>

The study involved 20 treated beef-breed calves (10 steers and
10 heifers) which were dosed orally with the paste.  The target dose was 4.5 
mg of oxfendazole per kg of body weight.  The calves were arranged in groups 
of four (two of each sex) and were killed at 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 days postdosing.<p>

The liver of each animal was collected at the time of slaughter and the 
concentration of the marker substance fenbendazole was determined by HPLC 
method developed by Syntex (BMS Method 87005.2).  The average results of those 
assays are shown below.<p>

A problem during the dosing of the animals caused three of the calves to 
receive less than the intended dose.  As a result, the liver values from those 
animals were not used in the calculation of the withdrawal time. The remaining 
17 liver residue values were analyzed statistically to determine tolerance 
limits (upper 99th percentile of the population determined with 95% 
confidence) for the concentration of the fenbendazole in the liver.  The 
analysis of the data with the Rm of 0.8 ppm for the fenbendazole marker gave a 
withdrawal time of 11 days for cattle treated with the paste formulation of 
oxfendazole.<p>

<B>7.      Agency  Conclusions</B><p>

The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section 
512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and with
21 CFR 514 of the implementing regulations.  The data demonstrate that 
oxfendazole "SYNANTHIC &#174;  Bovine Dewormer" paste, 18.5%, when used under the 
labeled conditions of use in cattle is safe and effective for the removal and 
control of lung and gastrointestinal worms.   This approval also relies on the 
approved NADA 140-854 (oxfendazole 9.06% and 22.5% suspensions) and makes 
direct reference to the specific sections involved.<p>

A tolerance is established for total oxfendazole residues in edible cattle 
tissues based on a marker residue concentration of 0.8 ppm fenbendazole in the 
target tissue liver.   A fenbendazole concentration of 0.8 ppm in liver 
corresponds to a total safe concentration of oxfendazole residues of 0.84 ppm 
in muscle, 1.7 ppm in liver, 2.5 ppm in kidney, and 3.3 ppm in fat.  
Oxfendazole and fenbendazole are benzimidazole  anthelmintics  with an 
identical  metabolite pattern. Fenbendazole is a major metabolite of both 
drugs.<p>

A withdrawal period of 11 days has been established for 18.5% oxfendazole 
paste at 4.5 mg/kg (2.05 mg/lb) dosage based on a statistical analysis of the 
depletion data, using an upper tolerance limit containing 99 percent of the 
population with a 95% confidence limit.<p>

Because of the drug's route of administration, conditions to be treated, and 
the ability of a layperson to determine these conditions, the agency has 
concluded that 18.5% oxfendazole paste labeling contains adequate directions 
for use by a layperson and thus, the drug may be marketed over-the-counter.   
The oral suspensions of oxfendazole have an approved product available as an 
OTC product at 4.5 mg/kg dosage (<B>21 CFR 520.1630</B>).<p>

The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of 
this action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant 
impact on the human environment and that neither an environmental  assessment 
nor an environmental impact statement is required.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 
this approval for food producing animals qualifies for 3 years of marketing 
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because new clinical or field 
investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) were essential 
to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the 
applicant.<p>

Summary</b><p>
<b>I. GENERAL INFORMATION:</b><p>
<b> Identification:</b>     NADA 140-904<p>
 <b>Sponsor:</b><p>         Veterinary Research and Development, Inc.  <br>
                    P.O. Box 1299<br>
                    Truckee, CA 95734<p>
 <b>Generic Name:</b>       Copper disodium edetate<p>
 <b>Trade Name:</b>          Bovi-Cu<p>
 <b>Marketing Status:</b>   OTC<p>
 <b>Date of Summary:</b> April 18, 1989<p>
<b>II. INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b><p>
For use in beef cattle and beef calves to prevent copper deficiency alone on or
in association with molybdenum toxicity.<p>
<b>III. DOSAGE:</b><p>
<b>Dosage form:</b>  Injection, 60 mg Cu per ml.<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>  Subcutaneously in the neck area.<p>
<b>Recommended dosage:</b><p>  Nursing calves-1 ml<br> Calves over 300 pounds-2 ml<br>Older
cattle-2 ml<p>
<b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
The efficacy of Copper glycinate has been established by the National Academy
of Sciences and the National Research Council (NAS/NRC) which evaluated the
drug to be effective in the prevention of copper deficiency alone or in
association with molybdenum toxicity in beef cattle.<p>
The Food and Drug Administration concurred with the findings of the NAS/NRC,
which were published in the <i>Federal Register</i>&#160; on April 8, 1969, 34 FR 6259.<p>
Accordingly, a bioequivalency study was conducted by Veterinary Research and
Development, Inc. to demonstrate the bioequivalency of its product, copper
disodium edetate as a source of copper, to the NAS/NRC/DESI reviewed copper
glycinate product.<p>
<b>Bioequivalency Study:</b><p>
This study was conducted in 1982 by V.R. Bohman D.V.M. at the University of
Nevada.  Compliance with the Good Laboratory Practices regulation was shown.<p>
<b>Study Design</b><p>
Twelve Hereford steers, averaging 568 lbs, were assigned at random to two
treatment groups.  One group received 120 mg of copper as Cu-glyc and the other
120 mg of copper as Cu disodium edetate by subcutaneous injection.  Immediately
prior to administering the copper salts, blood and liver (biopsy) samples were
taken as well as at 28-day intervals over a 112-day period after
administration. The copper levels in the samples were determined by atomic
absorption spectrophotometric methods.<p>
<b>Results</b><p>
The plasma copper levels remained relatively constant throughout the study.
This was in agreement with several other studies supplied by the sponsor which
indicated that plasma copper remains fairly constant after liver stores reach
40 parts per million (ppm) or higher on a dry matter basis.  The liver copper
residues in the Veterinary Research and Development, Inc. study were around 33
ppm at the beginning.  Following the administration of either form of copper,
the liver copper stores were significantly increased (4x) and decreased
logarithmically thereafter.  The following table contains the liver
concentrations of copper obtained in this study:<p>

</pre>

The data submitted in support of this approval show that copper disodium
edetate as a source of copper is the bioequivalent of copper glycinate when
used in accordance to the needs of the animal and at recommended dosages.
Copper disodium edetate promotes similar growth, tissue levels of copper and
synthesis of ceruloplasmin to copper glycinate.  Liver stores of copper from
both compounds are similar.<p>
<p>
<b>V. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p>
Copper glycinate was evaluated by NAS/NRC and found to be safe for use in
cattle.  FDA concurred with the findings of the NAS/NRC, which were published
in the <i>Federal Register</i>&#160; on April 8, 1969, 34 PR 6259.<p>
Target animal safety study is not required for this copper disodium edetate
product.<p>
<b>VI. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
In the bioequivalency study described previously, six cattle were injected with
Veterinary Research and Development's copper disodium edetate injection
preparation, and six were given the cupric glycinate injection preparation.
For purposes of comparing the relative levels of copper in cattle liver, biopsy
samples were taken at 28 day intervals.  The mean levels of copper (&#181;g/g wet
tissue) in the cattle liver were as follows:<p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 6 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>

Mean Levels (6 Animals)

<b>Copper disodium edetate</b>   8.61       39.12      39.27      21.56       19.82 
<b>Copper glycinate</b>          10.33       38.82      32.40      21.25       19.10 

</pre>
Although CVM's Bioequivalency Guidelines do not provide for biopsy sampling to
measure tissue residues for the purpose of bioequivalency determinations, the
Guidelines do not foreclose biopsy sampling for that purpose.  Moreover, CVM
recognizes that the results of biopsy sampling may be used for comparisons,
where appropriate.  In this case, CVM determined that the sponsor showed that
its copper disodium edetate product is bioequivalent to the DESI reviewed (and
FDA approved) copper glycinate product, because all the residue values were
within normal limits for copper in cattle liver.  Therefore, Veterinary
Research and Development's copper disodium edetate injection will have the same
30 day withdrawal period as the approved copper glycinate product.<p>
<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of 512 of
the Act and demonstrate that Bovi-Cu (copper disodium edetate), when used under
its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled
indications.<p>
Copper products that carry only the prevention claim and not the treatment
claim are marketed over the counter.  Adequate directions for use have been
written for the layman and the conditions of use prescribed on the labeling are
likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the agency has concluded that
this copper product labeled only for the prevention of copper deficiency alone
or in association with molybdenum toxicity be granted over the counter
marketing status.<p>
New animal drug applications for NAS/NRC/DESI reviewed compounds are eligible
for approval based upon demonstration of bioequivalence at the same withdrawal
time as the NAS/NRC/DESI accepted preparation.  Therefore, Bovi-Cu has the
approved 30 day withdrawal period.<p>

<b>Date of Summary:</b>  May 25, 1993<p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b> <p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the 
Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 
1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug application
(ANADA) 
may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new animal drug (pioneer
product). 
New target animal safety data, drug effectiveness data, and human food safety
data (other 
than tissue residue data) are not required for approval of an ANADA. An ANADA
relies on 
the target animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the
pioneer's 
new animal drug application. Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic 
product is bioequivalent to the pioneer. If bioequivalence is demonstrated
through a clinical 
end-point study, then a tissue residue study to establish the withdrawal time
for the generic 
product is also required. For certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a
waiver from 
conducting an <i> in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth
GADPTRA 
Policy Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990). <p>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Agri
Laboratories, Ltd. 
was granted a waiver from conducting an <i> in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study for
sulfadimethoxine 
injection 40%. The generic and pioneer products are injectable solutions with
the same 
active and inactive ingredients. The generic and pioneer products also contain
the same 
concentration of active ingredient. <p>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY: </b><p>
<b>Tolerance for the marker residue</b> <p>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product. <p>
A tolerance of 0.1 ppm (negligible residue) is established for sulfadimethoxine
residues in 
the uncooked edible <b>tissues</b> of cattle under 21 CFR 556.640. <p>
A tolerance of 0.01 ppm (negligible residue) is established for
sulfadimethoxine residues in 
<b>milk</b> under 21 CFR 556.640. <p>
<b>Withdrawal Times</b> <p>
When a waiver of the <i> in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study is granted, the generic
product 
withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer product. <p>
<b>a Slaughter:</b> 5 days in cattle <p>
<b>b. Milk Withholding:</b><p> Milk taken from animals during treatment and for 60 hours
(5 milkings) 
after the latest treatment must not be used for food. <p>
<b>Regulatory Method: </b><p>
The analytical method for the determination of sulfadimethoxine in tissues uses
a thin 
layer-densitometric procedure. This method is found in the <i>Official Methods of
Analysis of 
the Association of Official Analytical Chemists </i>, 15th edition, 1990. <p>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b> <p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that 
sulfadimethoxine injectable solution, when used under its proposed conditions
of use, is 
safe and effective for its labeled indications. <p>

<b>Generic Name:</b><p>        Nystatin, neomycin sulfate, thiostrepton,  
                    triamcinolone, acetonide ointment <p>
<b>Trade Name:</b>          Derm-Otic Ointment <p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    Rx <p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  November 21, 1989<p>
<b> II. Indications for Use </b> <p>
Derm-Otic Ointment  (nystatin, neomycin sulfate, thiostrepton,  
triamcinolone acetonide ointment) is particularly useful in the  
treatment of acute and chronic otitis of varied etiologies, in 
interdigital cysts in cats and dogs, and in anal gland infections in dogs. <p>
The preparation is also indicated in the management of dermatologic disorders
characterized by inflammation and dry or exudative dermatitis, particularly
those caused, complicated, or threatened by bacterial or candidal (<i>Candida
albicans </i>) infections.  It is also of value in eczematous dermatitis, and as an
adjunct in the treatment of dermatitis due to parasitic infestation. <p>
<b>III. Dosage Form(s), Route(s) of Administration, and Recommended  
Dosage(s) </b> <p>
The active ingredients are formulated in an ointment base. <p>
Derm-Otic Ointment is indicated for topical administration. <p>
Frequency of administration is dependent on the severity of the  
condition.  For mild inflammations, application may range from once daily to
once a week; for severe conditions Derm-Otic Ointment may be applied as often
as two or three times daily, if necessary. Frequency of treatment may be
decreased as improvement occurs. <p>
<b>Otitis</b> <p>
Clean ear canal of impacted cerumen.  Inspect canal and remove any foreign
bodies such as grass awns, ticks, etc.  Instill three to five drops of Derm-Otic 
Ointment. <p>
Preliminary use of a local anesthetic may be advisable. <p>
<b>Infected Anal Glands, Cystic Areas, etc.</b> <p>
Drain gland or cyst and then fill with Derm-Otic Ointment. <p>
<b>Other Dermatologic Disorders</b> <p>
Clean affected areas, removing any encrusted discharge or exudate.  
Apply Derm-Otic Ointment sparingly in a thin film. <p>
<b>IV. Effectiveness </b> <p>
Derm-Otic Ointment and the pre-1962
pioneer product (Panalog Ointment NADA 12-258,
Solvay Veterinary, Inc., formerly E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc.) contain the
same active ingredients.  Both products contain nystatin 100,000 units,
neomycin sulfate 2.5 mg, thiostrepton 2,500 units, and triamcinolone acetonide
1.0 mg.  The pioneer product, Panalog, was the subject of a review by the
National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy
Study Group.  NAS/NRC determined Panalog Ointment to be "probably effective"
and recommended labeling changes. Subsequently, the product was determined to
be "effective" by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) when the application
was supplemented by providing the required label revisions. This was published
in a Federal Register Notice, Volume 35, No. 166, Wednesday, August 26, 1970.
It was also codified in 21 CFR 524.1600a. <p>
This product is chemically equivalent to the approved product, it bears the
same claims, it is topically applied and is for local therapeutic effect.
Therefore, as provided under 21 CFR 320.22, the Center for Veterinary Medicine
waived the requirement for submission of evidence of <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioavailability 
and
bioequivalency. <p>
<b>V. Animal Safety </b> <p>
Reference is again made to the NAS/NRC review of Panalog Ointment. The Council
determined the product was safe and "probably effective" with labeling changes.
The safety of the product was increased by changing its marketing status from
over the counter (OTC) to prescription (Rx). In addition, the Derm-Otic
Ointment labeling includes the safety information required by CVM in the
Federal Register announcement of December 13, 1984 covering drug products
containing a steroid. <p>
<b>VI. Human Safety </b> <p>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b> <p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  This product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only on cats and dogs, which are non-food animals.
<p>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b> <p>
Labeling contains an adequate caution statement. <p>
Dosage and Administration section of the package insert states: "Wear gloves
during the administration of the ointment or wash hands immediately after
application." <p>
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions </b> <p>
This is a generic NADA.  The pre '62 pioneer prototype is Panalog (NADA 12-258).
 In accordance with 21 CFR 320.22, CVM waived the requirement for
bioequivalency data for this topical product.  This application provides
labeling revisions recommended by the NAS/NRC efficacy panel and required by
the Agency to establish safety and effectiveness. Approval is based on the
chemical equivalency of this generic drug and the pre '62 pioneer product. <br>
<br>
Derm-Otic Ointment, when used under its approved conditions of use, is safe and
effective for the treatment of acute and chronic otitis of varied etiologies,
for interdigital cysts in cats and dogs, for anal gland infections in dogs, for
management of moist or dry dermatologic disorders characterized by
inflammation:  bacterial, candidal (<i>Candida albicans </i>), contact, eczematous, and
seborrheic dermatitis; and as an adjunct in the treatment of dermatitis due to
parasitic infestation. <p>
The labeling for this product contains the veterinary prescription legend
because the expertise of a veterinarian is necessary for diagnoses of the
etiologies of the conditions for which the product is indicated, for proper
preparation of the animal for drug administration (otitis &amp; anal glands),
and for supervision of the progress of the animal to reduce the potential of
adverse side effects such as: SAP and SGPT (ALT) enzyme elevations,
polydipsia/polyuria, vomiting, diarrhea (occasionally bloody), Cushing's
syndrome, and deafness. <p>

 <b>Summary:</b>  <p>
 The Analysis of Variance for Average Daily Gain pooled the ten replicates
from studies &#35;4249 and &#35;3788 and analyzed the data without specific
consideration for the heifers in study &#35;4249.  The site by treatment
interaction was not significant (P&gt;.3533) and this term was pooled into
error. In this analysis, there was a site effect (P&#61;.0002) but no treatment
effect (P&#61;.1216).   However, a one-tailed t test used to test for treatment
difference between treated and control animals was significant at P&#61;.0608.
This indicated that lasalocid was effective to increase the rate of weight gain
in pasture cattle when received through consumption of Moorman's mineral
mixture.  <p>
 A coefficient of variation (C.V.) was calculated for the two effectiveness
studies (&#35;4249 and &#35;3788) based upon consumption of lasalocid (mg/head/day).
The model used contained terms for location, period, location by period, and
error, as sources of variance.  A C.V. of 43.722 was calculated based upon a
mean of 146.8 mg and a calculated Mean Square Error (MSE) &#61; 4119.57, where C.V.
&#61; ((sqare root of MSE)/Mean)) x 100.  A C.V. was also calculated for study &#35;4095
based upon consumption of lasalocid (mg/head/day).   The model used contained
terms for period and error as sources of variance.  A C.V. of 9.4345 was
calculated based upon a mean of  161.4 mg and a MSE of 231.917.  <p>
 The average intake for studies &#35;3788, &#35;4095 and &#35;4113 was within the
efficacious range of 60 to 200 mg per head daily (21 CFR 558.311), and the C.V.
calculated for the intake study (&#35;4095) was 9.4345&#37;, which is less than the
C.V. of 43.722&#37; calculated for the two studies (&#35;3788 and &#35;4113) in which
effectiveness of lasalocid in free-choice mineral mixture was established.
Since the variation in intake compares favorably with the effectiveness data
the free-choice mineral mixture is effective when fed to pasture
cattle.  <p>
 <b>5.   Animal Safety</b>  <p>
 Animal safety data was provided by authorized reference to NADA  96-298V
(see FOI dated December 14,  1984, FR Vol. 49, No. 246, page 49449; July 28,
1982,  FR Vol.  47,  No.  152,  page  34133;  May  4,  1987,  FR Vol.  52,  No.
85; page 16239).  <p>
 <b>6.   Human Safety</b>  <p>
 Human safety data was provided by authorized references to NADA  96-298V
(see FOI dated December 14,  1984, FR Vol. 49, No. 246, page 49449; July 28,
1982, FR Vol. 47, No.  152,  page 34133; and May 4,  1987, FR Vol. 52, No. 85,
page 16239).   <p>
 <b>7.   Agency Conclusions:</b>  <p>
 For the Center for Veterinary Medicine's review, since this original new
animal drug application relied on information in a previously approved new
animal drug application (NADA 96-298), it was treated as if it were a
supplemental new animal drug application.   Therefore, under the CVM
supplemental new animal drug application policy (December 23,  1977, 42 FR
64367),  this is a Category II change providing for the use of lasalocid in
Moorman's Cattle Minerals BT Medicated, as a free-choice and self-limiting
supplemental feed in pasture cattle (slaughter, stocker, feeder cattle, and
dairy and beef replacement heifers).  <p>
 The new use provided by this application does not constitute an expanded
use because this is only a change in the type of carrier for the drug.
Therefore, a review of the underlying human food and target animal safety under
NADA 96-298 is not required.  <p>
 Moorman Manufacturing Company provided data demonstrating that lasalocid in
Moorman's Cattle Mineral BT Medicated is effective, while Hoffmann La Roche
supplied data demonstrating safety or the product.  Therefore, this application
is approved. <p>

<b>FOI SUMMARY</B><p>
<b>Date of Approval:  </b>February 19, 1982<p>
I.  Kay Dee Feed Co., 1919
Grand Avenue, Sioux City, Iowa 51107 has an     appoved NADA
128-255.   The application provides for Kay Dee Tylan
5 Sulfa Premix and Kay Dee Tylan 10 Sulfa Premix containing 5 or 10
grams   per pound each of tylosin and sulfamethazine, respectively.<p>

II. The claims are for maintaining weight gains and feed efficiency in the
presence of atrophic rhinitis; lowering the incidence and severity of
<i>Bordetella bronchiseptica</i>&#160; rhinitis; prevention of swine dysentery 
(vibrionic); control of swine pneumonias caused by bacterial
pathogens (<i>Pasteurella multocida</i>&#160; and/or <i>Corynebacterium pyogenes </i>). 
Feeds containing Tylosin and Sulfamethazine must be  withdrawn 15 days
before swine are slaughtered.<p>

III.  The premixes are to be added to the feed such that the complete feed
contains 100 grams of tylosin and 100 qrams of sulfamethazine per ton.<p>

IV. The safety and efficacy data upon which this application was
approved 
are found in NADAs 12-49l and 4l-275 for Elanco Products Company, and are
summarized in a FOI Summary filed with the Hearing Clerk under the generic name
of the drug.<p>

V.  Approval of this application is based on safety and
effectiveness data contained in Elanco Products Company's approved NADAs
12-491 and 41-275.  Use of the data in NADAs 12-491 and 41-275 to support
this application    has been authorized by Elanco.  This approval does not
change the  approved use of the drug.  Consequently, approval of this
NADA poses no  
increased human risk from exposure to residues of the animal drug, nor    does it change
the conditions of the drug's safe use in the target  animal species.
Accordingly, under the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine's  supplemental
approval policy (42 FR 64367), approval of this NADA has    been treated as
would approval of a Category II supplemental NADA and
does        not require reevaluation of the safety and
effectiveness in NADAs  12-491 and 41-275.<p>

FOI SUMMARY</b><p>







<b>I. General Information:</b><p>
 <b>NADA Number:</b>     140-847<p>
 <b>Sponsor: </b><p>        Altana Inc.<br>
                    60 Baylis Road<br>
                    Melville, New York 11747<p>
 <b>Generic Name:</b> <p>       Nystatin, neomycin sulfate, thiostrepton, triamcinolone
acetonide ointment<p>
 
 <b>Trade Name:</b>           Animax Ointment<p>
 <b>Marketing Status:</b>    Prescription (Rx)<p>
 <b>Date of Summary:</b>  September 30, 1988<p>
<b>II. Indications for Use:</b><p>
Animax Ointment (nystatin, neomycin sulfate, thiostrepton, triamcinolone
acetonide ointment) is particularly useful in the treatment of acute and
chronic otitis of varied etiologies, in interdigital cysts in cats and dogs,
and in anal gland infections in dogs.<p>
The preparation is also indicated in the management of dermatologic disorders
characterized by inflammation and dry or exudative dermatitis, particularly
those caused, complicated, or threatened by bacterial or candidal (<i>Candida
albicans </i>) infections. It is also of value in eczematous dermatitis, contact
dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis, and as an adjunct in the treatment of
dermatitis due to parasitic infestation.<p>
<b>III. Dosage Form(s), Route(s) of Administration and Recommended Dosage(s):</b><p>
  The active ingredients are formulated in an ointment base.<p>
  Animax Ointment is indicated for topical
administration.<p>
   Frequency of administration is dependent on the severity
of the condition.  For mild inflammations, application may range from once
daily to once a week; for severe conditions Animax Ointment may be applied as
often as two or three times daily, if necessary.  Frequency of treatment may be
decreased as improvement occurs.<p>
<b>Otitis:</b><p>  Clean ear canal of impacted cerumen.  Inspect canal and remove any
foreign bodies such as grass awns, ticks, etc.  Instill three to five drops of
Animax Ointment.<p>
Preliminary use of a local anesthetic may be advisable.<p>

<b>Infected Anal Gland, Cystic Areas, etc.</b>: <p> Drain gland or cyst and then fill
with Animax Ointment.<p>

<b>Other Dermatologic Disorders: </b><p> Clean affected areas, removing any encrusted
discharge or exudate.  Apply Animax Ointment sparingly in a thin film.<p>
<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><p>
Animax Ointment and the pre-1962 pioneer product (Panalog Ointment NADA
 12-258, Solvay Veterinary, Inc., formerly E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc.)
contain the same active ingredients.  Both products contain nystatin 100,000
units, neomycin sulfate 2.5 mg, thiostrepton 2,500 units, and triamcinolone
acetonide 1.0 mg.  The pioneer product, Panalog Ointment, was the subject of a
review by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC),
Drug Efficacy Study Group.  NAS/NRC determined Panalog Ointment  to be "probably 
effective" and recommended labeling changes.
Subsequently, the product was determined  to be "effective" by the Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) when the application was supplemented by providing
the required label revisions.  This was published in a Federal Register Notice,
Volume 35, No. 166, Wednesday, August 26, 1970.  It was also codified in 21 CFR
524.1600a.<p>
This product is chemically equivalent to the approved product, it bears the
same claims, it is topically applied and is for local therapeutic effect.
Therefore, as provided under 21 CFR 320.22, the Center for Veterinary Medicine
waived the requirement for submission of evidence of <i>in vivo </i>&#160; bioavailability
and bioequivalency.<p>
<b>V. Animal Safety:</b><p>
Reference is again made to the NAS/NRC review of Panalog Ointment. The Council
determined the product was safe and "probably effective" with labeling changes.
The safety of the product was increased by changing its marketing status from
OTC to Rx.  In addition, the Animax Ointment labeling includes the safety
information required by CVM in the Federal Register announcement of December
13, 1984 covering drug products containing a steroid.<p>
<b>VI. Human Safety:</b><p>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption</b><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  This product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only on cats and dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><p> Labeling
contains an adequate caution statement.<p>
Dosage and Administration section of the package insert states: "Wear gloves
during the administration of the ointment or wash hands immediately after
application."<p>
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
This is a generic NADA.  The pre '62 pioneer prototype is Panolog (NADA
 12-258).  In accordance with 21 CFR 320.22, CVM waived the requirement for
bioequivalency data for revisions recommended by the NAS/NRC efficacy panel and
required by the Agency to establish safety and effectiveness.  Approval is
based on the chemical equivalency of this generic drug and the pre '62 pioneer
drug.<p> Animax Ointment, when used under its approved conditions of use, is safe
and effective for the treatment of acute and chronic otitis of varied
etiologies, for interdigital cysts in cats and dogs, for anal gland infections
in dogs, for management of moist or dry dermatologic disorders characterized by
inflammation: bacterial, candidal (<i>Candida albicans </i>), contact, eczematous,
seborrheic, and parasitic (ear mites).<p>
The labeling for this product contains the veterinary prescription legend
because the expertise of a veterinarian is necessary for diagnoses of the
etiologies of the conditions for which the product is indicated, for proper
preparation of the animals for drug administration (otitis &amp; anal glands)
and for supervision of the progress of the animals to reduce the potential of

<m><b>Date of Summary:  </b>March 18, 1994<p>
<b>2.    TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990  (55  FR 3107),
following the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article
(ANADA 200-075; generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company
is entitled to the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with BMD.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR &#167;  558.550. Bacitracin methylene disalicylate is codified under
21 CFR &#167;  558.76. The combination of salinomycin sodium and
bacitracin methylene disalicylate is codified under 21 CFR &#167;
 558.550(a)  and (b)(1)(iii) and (vi).<p>
<b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<p>
<b>a.    Tolerances/Safe Concentrations for Residues</b><p>
The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<p>
Tolerances for residues of bacitracin from bacitracin methylene disalicylate
are established at 0.5 ppm negligible residues in uncooked edible tissues of
chickens (21 CFR &#167;   556.70). <p>
<b> b.  Withdrawal Time</b> <p> As specified in 21 CFR &#167;
558.550(b)(1)(iii) and (vi), a 0-day withdrawal time       is required for the
combination of bacitracin methylene disalicylate and       salinomycin.<p>
<b>c.   Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
 A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue
levels in    all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were
significantly below the  established safe concentration for total
residues.    A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for
bacitracin residues.     The method entitled "Modified Microbiological Method
for Determination of     Bacitracin in Tissues" is on file at the Center for
Veterinary Medicine, Food    and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl.,
Rockville, MD 20855.<p>
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
    This ANADA submitted under section 512Co) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic     Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the    combination of salinomycin sodium and bacitracin
methylene disalicylate, when used    under its proposed conditions of use, is
safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

INFORMATION (FOI) SUMMARY</b><p>





 <b>1. General Information </b><p>
 <b>NADA Number: </b>     140-851<p>
 <b>Sponsor: </b><p>         HESS &AMP; CLARK, INC.<br>
                    7th &amp; Orange Sts.<br>
                    Ashland, OH 44805<p>
 <b>Generic Name:</b>        0.2% Nitrofurazone Dressing (water soluble) 
                    Veterinary<p>
 <b>Trade Name:  </b>          NFZ Wound Dressing<p>
 <b>Marketing Status:  </b>   OTC<p>
 <b>Date of Summary:  </b>July 7, 1989<p>
 <b>2. Indication for Use </b><p>
For the prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds,
burns, and cutaneous ulcers of dogs, cats and horses (not for food use).<p>
 <b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage </b><p>
<b>a.  Dosage Form</b> -  Water soluble antibacterial ointment containing 0.2%
nitrofurazone.<p>
<b>b.  Route of Administration</b> - Topical application.<p>
<b>c.  Recommended Dosage</b> -<p> Apply directly on the lesion with a spatula or first place
on a piece of gauze.  Application of a bandage is optional.<p>
This preparation should be in contact with the lesion for at least 24 hours.
The dressing may be changed several times daily or left on the lesion for a
longer period.<p>
 <b>4 and 5. Effectiveness and Safety </b><p>
Nitrofurazone Ointment (Furacin Dressing Veterinary, NADA 6-475) was the
subject of a review by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research
Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, the results of which were
published in the Federal Register of January 19, 1979 (44 FR 4014).  NAS/NRC
concluded, and FDA concurred, that the product was "effective" for the
prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds, burns, and
cutaneous ulcers.  Due to concern for the safety of residues from food
producing animals, FDA concluded that use of this and other NAS/NRC reviewed
nitrofurazone topical products must be limited to dogs, cats and horses (not
intended for food use).  The Federal Register publication dated January 19,
1979, on Nitrofurazone Topical Preparations for use in non food animals, states
that applications providing for the effective conditions of use identified in
that notice need not include data required by 21 CFR 514.111 to establish the
effectiveness of the drug for these uses.<p>
Under Center for Veterinary Medicine policy, the principles of 21 CFR 320.22
providing for a waiver of the requirement for submission of evidence of <i>in vivo</i>&#160;
bioavailability and bioequivalence are applied to NAS/NRC reviewed topicals
which have been found to be effective.  Therefore, such data were neither
required nor submitted.<p>
 <b>6. Human Safety </b><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved for use only on
dogs, cats and horses (not for food use) and is labeled:  Warning:  Do no use on
horses intended for food.<p>
<b>Human safety relative to possession, handling and administration:</b><p>  Labeling
contains adequate warning statements.  Labeling states:<p>  "HUMAN WARNINGS:<p> 
Carcinogenesis:  Nitrofurazone has been shown to produce mammary tumors in rats
and ovarian tumors in mice.  <p>
Some people may be hypersensitive to this product.  Either wear gloves when
applying, or wash hands afterwards."<p>
In addition, the labeling contains the following statement:<p>  "KEEP OUT OF REACH
OF CHILDREN"<P>
<b> 7. Agency Conclusions </b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the conclusions of
NAS/NRC review as concurred in by FDA and with CVM's policy concerning
bioequivalence of topical drugs and demonstrate that NFZ Wound Dressing (0.2%
nitrofurazone ointment), when used under its approved conditions of use, is
safe and effective for the prevention or treatment of bacterial infections of
wounds, burns and cutaneous ulcers on dogs, cats and horses (not for food
use).<p>
The drug is labeled for over-the-counter use for the following reasons: <p>
a. It is a generic topical antibacterial preparation with a long OTC marketing
history of safe and effective use for the above indications.<p>
b. A diagnosis by a veterinarian is not necessary, as the labeled use
conditions are easily recognized by the layman.<p>
In view of the above, it is approved for OTC marketing because adequate
directions for use by the layman can be written.<p>

 <b>            Freedom Of Information Summary <p>for<p> LINCOMYCIN AND
PYRANTEL TARTRATE PREMIXES</b> <p> 
 <b>I.  General Information:</b> <p>

 <b>NADA Number:</b>   138-941 <p> 
    <b>Sponsor Name/Address:</b><p>    The Upjohn Company<br>      Agricultural
Division<br>        Kalamazoo, MI  49001 <p>
 <b>Sponsor Number: </b>             000009 <p> 
    <b>Generic Name:</b>    lincomycin hydrochloride/pyrantel 
tartrate <p>
 <b>Trade Name:</b>                   Lincomix&#174;/Banminth&#174; <p>
    <b>Note:</b> The Present application provides for the combined use in
the  finished swine feed of two presently approved premix products, 
Banminth (pyrantel tartrate) as per 21 CFR &#167;558.485,     and
Lincomix  
    (lincomycin} as per 21 CFR &#167;558.325, rather than for  
        a premix     incorporating both of these compounds. <p> 
    <b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC<p> 
    <b>Date of Summary:</b>  December 11, 1985<p>
    
    <b>II.  Indications for Use:</b> <p> 
 For reduction in the severity of swine mycoplasmal pneumonia caused by
<i>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae </i>;   aid in the prevention of migration and
establishment of large roundworm  ( <i>Ascaris suum </i>) infections; aid
in the prevention of establishment of nodular worm (<i>Oesophaqostomum spp </i>)
 infections of swine when fed in accordance  with directions  for
use. <p> 
 <b>III.  Dosaqe Form, Route of Administration, and Recommended
Dosages</b> <ul><p>
 <li><b>Dosage Form:</b> <p>  Currently approved medicated premix formulations of pyrantel
tartrate (NADA #43-290) and lincomycin (NADA #97-505) will serve as the dosage
formulations. <p>
  <li><b>Route of Administration:</b> <p>  These medicated feed premixes are used by  
 feed manufacturers to formulate complete swine feed or feed supplements for
oral administration via feed. <p>
 <li><b> Recommended Dosages: </b> <p> To be used in a medicated swine feed
containing  
 200 g lincomycin hydrochloride plus 
 96 g pyrantel tartrate per ton and fed as the sole ration for 21 days.  Not
to be fed to swine that weigh  
 more than 250 pounds. </ul><p>

 <b>IV. Effectiveness:</b>   <p> 
 The efficacy of pyrantel tartrate at 96 and 200 grams per ton against large
roundworms and nodular worms was established in NADA 43-290, 38 FR 3402,
2/6/73. <p>
 The efficacy of lincomycin at 200 grams per ton against myco-plasmal
pneumonia in swine was established in NADA  97-505, 47 FR 52145, ll/l9/82. <p> 
 The drugs act independently of each other.  Lincomycin has no indication
for anthelmintic activity and pyrantel tartrate no indication for mycoplasmal
pneumonia. <p> 
 The requirement to conduct studies to demonstrate the independent claims of
these drugs when used in combination has been satisfied in NADA  116-044 (47 FR
30244, 7/14/82} which provides for the use of 96 grams of pyrantel tartrate
with 40 and 100 grams of lincomycin.  Although NADA  116-040 is for the use
of 96 grams of pyrantel tartrate with 40-100 grams of lincomycin, this NADA
contains studies to demonstrate the individual claims of these drugs when fed
in combination at 96 grams of pyrantel tartrate and 200 grams of lincomycin.
In addition, analytical tests demonstrate that the two drugs do not chemically
interfere with each other. <p>
 <b>V. Animal Safety:</b> <p>
 <b></b>Please refer to the Animal Safety-sections of the FOI Summary data
submitted for NADA  116-044. <p>
 <b>VI. Human Safety:</b> <p> 
 Please refer to the Human Safety sections of the FOI Summary data submitted
for NADA  116-044, 47 FR 30244, 7/14/82. <p>
 <b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b> <p> 
 Approval of this original NADA is based on safety and effectiveness data in
Pfizer's approved NADAs  43-290 and  116-044.  Use of the data in these NADAs to
support this application has been authorized by Pfizer. <p> 
 Pyrantel tartrate and lincomycin have been approved individually and the
residues have been shown to be below the regulated tolerance at 6 days of
withdrawal.  Since the drugs are currently marketed for the claim, this
approval poses no significant increase in the frequency of human exposure to
residues of the drugs.  Accordingly, this original NADA has been treated as a
category II supplement which did not require a reevaluation of the human safety
supporting the parent applications. <p>

Ten (10) mg of albendazole per kg of body weight (4.54 mg/lb) administered
orally with a dispensing gun.<br>
<br>
<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><P>This NADA relies on adequate well-controlled
studies demonstrating the anthelmintic effectiveness of albendazole in cattle
included in the approved NADA 110-048 (Albendazole Suspension, 54 FR 25114,
June 13, 1989).  Based on dose titration data against <i>F. hepatica</i>&#160; contained in
NADA 110-048, an optimum effective dose of 10 mg albendazole per kg body weight
was determined.  The present NADA relies on a trial conducted in cattle which
demonstrates that the paste formulation has efficacy comparable to albendazole
suspension when used at the same dose of 10 mg/kg body weight.  This trial
tested the efficacy against the most difficult parasite control; viz, <i>F.
hepatica</i>, and it was demonstrated that the paste formulation was as effective
as the suspension with respect to <i>F. hepatica</i>&#160; and the other parasites indicated
on the labeling.  This conclusion is further supported by a number of
confirmatory studies which corroborate the efficacy against the other
parasites.<P><b>A. Pivotal Efficacy:</b><P>The following study was
conducted to demonstrate that the paste formulation has similar biological
efficacy to that of albendazole suspension when used at the same dose of
10 mg/kg body weight.  <i>F. hepatica</i>&#160; was chosen as the test species since this is
the most difficult parasite to control.<P>

This trial was designed to compare a single oral dose of 10
mg/kg of albendazole in the paste formulation to the drench suspension. Thirty
cattle from a fluke enzootic area in southern Idaho were selected based on the
presence of fluke eggs in their feces.  The cattle were divided into three
groups of ten animals each.  One group remained untreated and served as a
control.  The other groups were given either albendazole suspension or paste
formulation as a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg. At necropsy, 37 to 38 days
following treatment, the percent removal of the worms was recorded and is given
below.  No adverse reaction was observed.<P>

<b>B. Efficacy-Confirmation:</b><P>The results from the above
trial supported the conclusion that albendazole paste formulation, when given
orally to cattle at 10 mg/kg body weight, has efficacy comparable to
albendazole suspension against liver flukes.  Additional support of the
efficacy of albendazole paste formulation against adult and larval stages of
gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, and tapeworms was ascertained by four
investigators in seven controlled trials.  Infections were acquired naturally
in two of the trials and were experimentally induced in the remaining five
trials.  All of the cattle were necropsied at 6 to 14 days after treatment, and
parasites were recovered and counted.<P>The investigator and efficacy
against individual parasitic species are given in the following table.<P>

<b>C. Clinical Field Trials:</b><P>Well-documented clinical studies were
conducted in the United States according to an approved protocol which was
modified to accommodate the parasite(s) of interest and local management
conditions.  Groups of cattle with at least a moderate worm infection, as
determined by egg counts in their feces, were selected.  Approximately the same
numbers of animals were treated with albendazole or left untreated, as
controls.  Worm eggs in fecal samples were counted before and after treatment,
and animals were visually observed for side effects.  In two studies, the
severity of the parasitic infection precluded leaving some of the animals
untreated to serve as controls; therefore, in these two cases the entire group
of infected cattle was treated.<P>Thirteen trials were conducted by
eight investigators using albendazole paste formulation in nine states.  Cattle
of various breeds were treated and compared to untreated controls.
Investigators, trial locations and numbers of animals in the trials are
tabulated on the following pages.  The results of these clinical field trials
confirm the results of the controlled studies indicating elimination or
reduction of fecal egg counts in virtually all treated cattle. The paste
formulation at dosage levels ranging from 7.5 to 15 mg/kg was found to be safe
and practical under field conditions.<P>Clinical field trials conducted
by foreign investigators were also submitted. They confirm further the efficacy
of albendazole against a broad spectrum of gastrointestinal roundworm,
lungworm, tapeworm and liver fluke infections in cattle.<P>

<b>V. Target Animal Safety:</b><P>This NADA relies on safety studies that are
included in approved NADA 110-048 (albendazole suspension, 54 FR 25114, June 13,
1989), and these studies indicated the maximum tolerated dose in cattle is 45
mg/kg; (i.e., 4.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose).<P> At doses
higher that 45 mg/kg, toxic symptoms were: decreased activity and anorexia
followed by severe watery diarrhea and in some cases, death. Pathologic changes
consisted of fibrinous peritonitis and ascites, hydrothorax and acute pleuritis,
congestion of the abomasum and acute enteritis.<P>No overt adverse reactions were
observed in any of the efficacy or clinical field trials conducted with
albendazole paste formulation (with doses ranging form 7.5 to 15 mg/kg) in
cattle.<P><b>VI. Human Safety<P>A. Safe Concentration for Albendazole
Residues</b><P> The safe concentrations for total albendazole residues in the
uncooked edible tissues of cattle were established based upon toxicity studies
submitted under NADA 110-048.  Those values are: 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.2 ppm in
liver, 1.8 ppm in kidney, and 2.4 ppm in fat.<P><b>B. Marker Residue, Target
Tissue, and Rm (Tolerance) for Albendazole in Cattle</b><P> The residue and
metabolism studies by which the marker residue and target tissue for albendazole
were selected were conducted under NADA 110-048.  That work led to the assignment
of cattle liver as the target tissue and the 2-aminosulfone metabolite as the
marker residue.  The data also showed that, when total albendazole residues have
depleted to the 1.2 ppm safe concentration in liver, the level of the
2-aminosulfone metabolite in that tissue is approximately 0.2 ppm.  On that
basis, the tolerance (Rm) in liver was set at 0.2 ppm.<P><b>C. Regulatory Methods
for Residues</b><P>A regulatory method for the determination of the albendazole
marker residues was developed under NADA 110-048.  The determinative procedure is
based on the measurement of the 2-aminosulfone metabolite by high performance
liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.  The presence of the marker
residue can be confirmed by a procedure using mass spectrometry.<P>The
determinative and confirmatory procedures for albendazole are on display in the
FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, MD 20857).<P><b>D. Marker Residue Depletion Study and Calculation of a
Withdrawal Time</b><P>Under NADA 110-048, the sponsor established the intent to
have a single withdrawal time for the various dosage forms of albendazole being
developed. Twenty seven days was assigned as that withdrawal time as it was the
longest of the withdrawal times determined in residue depletion studies with the
individual dosage forms.<P>The residue depletion study with the paste formulation
was conducted under this NADA in order to determine the time required for
residues of the paste formulation to deplete to or below the 0.2 ppm tolerance.
The study used 32 head of beef cattle, each of which received a single oral 10
mg/kg body weight dose of the albendazole paste formulation.  The cattle were
euthanized in groups of eight (four heifers and four steers per group) at 20, 24,
28 or 32 days post dosing.<P>The livers were collected at the time of slaughter
and were assayed for the marker residue (the 2-aminosulfone metabolite) using the
determinative procedure of the regulatory assay.  The results are presented in
the following table.<P>

A statistical analysis of the depletion data using the upper tolerance
limit containing a 99 percentile of the population with 95% confidence limits
yielded a withdrawal time of 24 days.  A withdrawal time of 27 days is used for
labeling purposes with the paste formulation in order to have a single common
withdrawal time for all of the oral dosage forms of albendazole.<P><b>E. Safety to Handler</b><P>
Under NADA 110-048, studies were conducted which
demonstrated that the drug would have no ill effects on persons handling it if
the drug were used according to label recommendations.<P><b>VII.
Agency Conclusions:</b><P>The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy
the requirements of section 512 of the act and demonstrate that albendazole
paste, when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and
effective.<P>This albendazole paste provides for the same indications
for use, drug dosage level and duration, and same class(es) of cattle as the
albendazole suspension, NADA 110-048, approved on June 13, 1989 (54 FR
25114).<P>Based on work conducted under NADA 110-048, the safe
concentration for albendazole residues, the marker residue, target tissue, Rm
(tolerance) and approved analytical method were all established.  For this
albendazole paste, a residue depletion study in the target tissue liver
following the labeled dosage of a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg using the
approved analytical method demonstrated that the marker residue was well below
the established limit in less time than the 27 day withdrawal set for the
albendazole suspension. However, for consistency, both the albendazole paste
and suspension bear the 27 day withdrawal.<P>The agency concludes that
adequate directions for use by the laity have been written for the proposed
over the counter use of this anthelmintic which is indicated for the removal
and control of parasites commonly occurring in cattle, the same as the recently
approved albendazole suspension that is marketed over the counter.<P>

<b>3.  Dosage </b> <p>
    <b>a.  Form: </b> A ready to use sterile formulation containing 1% Ivermectin and 10%
clorsulon.<br>
<br>
    <b>b.  Route of Administration:  </b>Subcutaneous injection only.<br>
<br>
    <b>c.  Recommended Dosage:  </b><p>1 ml of formulation (containing 10 mg Ivermectin and
100 mg clorsulon) per 50 kg,        or 200 mcg Ivermectin and 2 mg clorsulon per
kg. <p>
  <p>
<b>4.  Effectiveness</b> <p>
Clorsulon given in combination with Ivermectin by the subcutaneous route is
shown in the following trial summaries to be effective against adult
<i>Fasciola hepatica </i>&#160; and not to interfere with the efficacy or spectrum of
Ivermectin.  Dose selection was determined in five titration trials using
clorsulon in IVOMEC Injection vehicle.  Six dose-confirmation trials using
clorsulon alone and in combination with Ivermectin (formulated in IVOMEC
Injection vehicle) also were conducted. <p>
    <b>a.  Dose Determination</b><p>
        Five dose-titration trials were conducted using clorsulon formulated in
IVOMEC Injection vehicle.  These trials were directed at 8-week-old<i> F.
hepatica  </i>&#160;since immatures are less susceptible to clorsulon than are adults.
        Efficacy in these trials against the immatures was 70% or less at 2 mg/kg and
94% at 4 mg/kg.  Earlier,       clorsulon formulated in a different vehicle
resulted in 68% efficacy at 2 mg/kg against 8-week-old<i> F. hepatica </i>&#160;        as
well as 97% against adults at 2 mg/kg.  Based on these data, the formulation
selected for further            development contained 1% Ivermectin and 10% clorsulon
dissolved in the same vehicle as used in IVOMEC         Injection. <p>
        The following trials were conducted using clorsulon dissolved in IVOMEC
Injection vehicle against 8-week-       old<i> F. hepatica </i> .  <p>
        <b>1)  Trial 10551</b> was conducted by Dr. T.A. Yazwinski (University of Arkansas,
Fayetteville, AR).  Twenty-eight cattle artificially infected were randomly
allocated to four groups of equal size. When the <i>F. hepatica </i>&#160;
infections were 8 weeks old, each animal was given either vehicle or clorsulon
once subcutaneously.            Necropsies were performed 37 or 38 days later.  The
reductions were 17% at 1 mg/kg, 90% at 2 mg/kg, and         98% at 4 mg/kg.  No
adverse reactions were observed. <p>
        <b>2)  Trial 10639</b> was conducted by Dr. R.L. Kilgore (Merck Farms, Inc.,
Springdale, AR).  Twenty-four cattle        artificially infected were randomly
allocated to four groups of equal size.  When the<i> F. hepatica </i>&#160; infections
    were 8 weeks old, each animal was given either vehicle or clorsulon once
subcutaneously.  Necropsies were        performed six weeks later.  The reductions
recorded were 38% at 1 mg/kg, 87% at 2 mg/kg, and 97% at 4      mg/kg.  No adverse
reactions were observed. <p>
        <b>3)  Trial 10775</b> was conducted by Dr. A.F. Batty (Merck Sharp and Dohme, Ltd.,
Highfield Farm, Nr.             Hertford, Herts., U.K.).  Twenty-four cattle
artificially infected were randomly allocated to four groups of         equal size.
When the <i>F. hepatica </i>&#160; infections were 8 weeks old, each animal was given
either vehicle or           clorsulon once subcutaneously.  Necropsies were performed
three weeks later.  The reductions recorded were        5% at 1 mg/kg, 0% at 2
mg/kg, and 89% at 4 mg/kg.  No adverse reactions were observed. <p>
        <b>4)  Trial 10782</b> was conducted by Dr. A.F. Batty (Merck Sharp and Dohme, Ltd.,
Highfield Farm, Nr.             Hertford, Herts., U.K.).  Twenty-four cattle
artificially infected were randomly allocated to four groups of         equal size.
When the <i>F. hepatica </i>&#160; infections were 8 weeks old, each animal was given
either vehicle or           clorsulon once subcutaneously.  Necropsies were performed
three weeks later.  The reductions recorded were        0% at 1 mg/kg, 70% at 2
mg/kg, and 92% at 4 mg/kg.  No adverse reactions were observed. <p>
 
        <b>5)  Trial 10851</b> was conducted by Dr. C.H. Courtney (University of Florida,
Gainesville, FL).  Twenty-four      cattle artificially infected were randomly
allocated to four groups of equal size. When the<i> F. hepatica </i>&#160; were
eight weeks old, each animal was given either vehicle or clorsulon once
subcutaneously.  Necropsies were        performed 21 to 24 days later.  The
reductions recorded were 0% at 1 mg/kg, 47% at 2 mg/kg, and 91% at 4        mg/kg.
Other than minor, transient injection-site swellings observed in one to four
animals in each group,      no adverse reactions were observed. <p>
<br>
   <b> b.  Dose Confirmation:</b><p>
        Six dose confirmation trials were conducted using ivermectin, clorsulon, and
ivermectin/clorsulon            combination (each formulated in IVOMEC Injection
vehicle).  The purpose of the trials was to demonstrate         that clorsulon given
in combination with ivermectin by the subcutaneous route is effective against
adult<i> F.         hepatica </i>&#160; and has no effect on the efficacy of spectrum of
ivermectin.  In addition to<i> F. hepatica </i> , these trials         tested activity
against 11 species of parasitic nematodes, including the dose limiting species
<i>Cooperia             oncophora </i> , <i>Trichostrongylus colubriformis </i>&#160; and
<i>Nematodirus helvetianus </i> . Confirmation of efficacy against         these
species assures that there is no effect of clorsulon on the efficacy of
ivermectin over its entire spectrum         of antiparasitic activity, including
ectoparasites. <p>
        <b>1)  Trial 10810</b> was conducted by Dr. A.F. Batty (Merck Sharp and Dohme, Ltd.,
Highfield Farm, Nr.             Hertford, Herts., U.K.).  Twenty-four cattle were
artificially infected.  When the parasites were in the adult        stage, the
animals were randomly allocated to four groups of equal size.  Treatments
administered once           subcutaneously included vehicle (1 ml/50 kg), clorsulon (2
mg/kg), ivermectin (200 mcg/kg), and clorsulon      (2 mg/kg) combined with
ivermectin (200 mcg/kg).  Necropsies were performed three weeks later.  The
reductions (P&lt;0.05) listed below were recorded.  No adverse reactions were
observed.<p>

   <b> c.  Field Trials</b><p>
        Field trials were conducted in Louisiana, Oregon, and Florida using the
clorsulon/ivermectin combination at         the therapeutic use level to demonstrate
efficacy and safety under practical conditions.  Cattle in each trial       were
randomly allocated to groups based on presentation of replicates at the time of
treatment.  Control cattle      given vehicle (1 ml/50 kg) while the others were
given clorsulon (2 mg/kg) and ivermectin (200 mcg/kg) in        combination. Fecal
samples were examined for helminth ova per gram of feces at the time of
treatment and        
 
        again three weeks later.  Other than a few minor, transient injection-site
swellings, no adverse reactions were        observed.  Numbers of cattle utilized
are listed below and the results are listed on the next page. <p>

<b>5.  Animal Safety: </b> <p>
   <b> a.  Tolerance</b><p>
        Tolerance trial 11334 was conducted by Dr. R. Alva-Valdes (Merck Farms, Inc.,
Fulton, MO) to investigate      the response of cattle given clorsulon/ivermectin
combination in three consecutive daily administrations.         Five groups of eight
animals each were formed. One group was given vehicle at three times the
comparable      therapeutic dose level on each occasion.  Other groups were given
either clorsulon alone or the combination       at their therapeutic use levels (2
mg clorsulon/kg or 2 mg clorsulon kg in combination with 200 mcg            ivermectin
/kg, respectively) or at three times use level on each occasion.  Body weights
and feed            consumption were measured starting a week before initial treatments
and continuing for three weeks          thereafter, but no significant (p&gt;0.10)
differences were detected.  A few minor, transient swellings were           observed
in cattle given either product at the proposed use levels, but after 21 days
these had resolved as areas         of fibrosis in the form of plaques, nodules or
tracts in the subcutaneous tissue or underlying musculature, and        as sterile
gaseous debris surrounded by fibrosis.  These changes were all judged to be
clinically acceptable. <p>
    <b>b.  Toxicity</b><p>
        Toxicity trial 11235 was conducted by Dr. J.D. Pulliam (Merck Farms, Inc.,
Springdale, AR) to investigate      the response of cattle to clorsulon and
ivermectin in combination given once at elevated dose levels.  Four         groups of
six animals each were formed randomly. One group of cattle was given vehicle at
25 ml/50 kg (or         25 times the equivalent use level); cattle in the other three
groups were given clorsulon/ivermectin          combination at the therapeutic use
level ( 2 mg clorsulon and 200 mcg ivermectin/kg), 10 times the             therapeutic
user level, and 25 times the use level.  Each treatment was given once
subcutaneously with no      more than 10 ml being injected into any one site.  The
cattle were acclimated to conditions for 16 days before         treatment; clinical
observation, physical examination, hematologic values,  blood chemistry
profiles, and       body temperatures were measured before and during the body
temperatures were measured before and during        the trial. Feed consumption and
weight gain were measured before and after dosing.  All animals were
necropsied 14 to 16 days after treatment and histopathologic evaluations were
conducted on the control and        high-dose groups.  Statistically significant
(p&lt;0.05) treatment-by-day interaction was seen in 16 or the 36       analyses
performed.  However, for only one of these variables (aspartate transaminase)
was there any       suggestion that the interaction might be related to treatment
with the clorsulon/ivermectin combination.          

        Average daily feed consumption decreased with increasing dose levels.  Signs
of transient injection pain were        evident in some animals from all treatment
groups.  Clinically, subcutaneous injection-site lesions included       necrosis of
subcutaneous connective tissue and muscle, edema, fibrosis and inflammation.
Similar reactions       with tissue necrosis are seen with other injectable
products and these reactions have been clinically           acceptable.  Expected
larger site reactions were seen at doses greater than the proposed use
level. <p>
   <b> c.  Irritancy</b><p>
        Irritancy trial 11233 was conducted by Dr. J.D. Pulliam (Merck Farms, Inc.,
Fulton, MO) to determine the        injection-site acceptability of clorsulon alone
and in combination with ivermectin.  Sixteen cattle were        given clorsulon at
2 mg/kg once subcutaneously in one side of the neck and the combination ( 2 mg
    clorsulon and 200 mcg ivermectin/kg) once subcutaneously in the other side.
Each  injection site was        examined clinically on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28,
and 35 after treatment, or until necropsy.  Eight of the        cattle were
necropsied 21 days after treatment and eight were necropsied 35 days after
treatment.  Minor           injection-site reactions were observed and these were
usually of the greatest dimensions on Day 3.  The           swellings gradually
resolved and most were gone by Day 21.  At necropsy, injection-site lesion 21
days after      injection ranged from no visible changes to minor fibrous dermal
plaques and/or fibrotic  tracts  in the             underlying muscle. At 35 days after
treatment, injection-site lesions ranged from no visible changes to minor
traits in the underlying muscle.  These fibrotic scars in the muscle would
probably not be noticed at           slaughter.  The reactions were slightly greater
with the combination than with clorsulon alone.  Similar        reactions with
tissue necrosis are seen with other injectables and these reactions have been
clinically          acceptable. <p>
   <b> d.  Breeding Animal Safety</b><p>
        Breeding animal safety trials were not conducted with the
clorsulon/ivermectin combination.  Safety of either         component alone has
already been demonstrated in prior submissions. However, in the case of
clorsulon, the      prior data submitted were developed using an oral suspension
given at 14 mg/kg (twice the use level).  To        use these data in support of
injectable clorsulon, a bioavailability trial was conducted to compare plasma
levels following subcutaneous administration of clorsulon at 3 mg/kg (or 1.5
times the recommended use       level) compared to oral administration of the
suspension at 14 mg/kg. <p>
        Bioavailability trial 11012 was conducted by Dr. R.K. Fulton (Merck Farms,
Inc., Springdale, AR) to            determine the plasma concentration of clorsulon
following oral administration at 14 mg/kg versus            subcutaneous administration
at 3 mg/kg.  Fourteen cattle were used in a cross-over study.  Two animals were
    chosen randomly as controls and half the remaining animals were given either
clorsulon orally at 14 mg/kg        or clorsulon subcutaneously at 3 mg/kg on Days 0
and 28.  Blood samples were collected repeatedly after      treatments and assayed
for clorsulon.  Cattle given clorsulon injection had significantly (p&lt;0.01)
lower areas         under the curve, observed peak plasma levels, and time to peak
than did cattle given clorsulon orally, as listed       below.  No adverse
reactions were observed in any of the cattle. <p>

<b>6.  Human Safety:</b> <p>
<b>A.  Toxicity Tests </b><p>
No additional toxicity testing was done with the combination drug ivermectin
and clorsulon. <p>
 
 
<b>B.  Safe Concentration of Residues</b> <p>
The lowest no observable effect level (NOEL) for the drugs in this combination
was for ivermectin in a mouse oral teratogenic study where cleft palate was
observed above levels of 0.2 mg/kg/day. Thus using a 1000 times safety factor,
an acceptable daily intake of up to two tenths micrograms (0.2 mcg) per
kilogram of ivermectin residue by an individual in food.<p>
<pre>
i.e.,                0.2 mg  
               ----------------- = 0.2 mcg.  
               1000 safety factor

</pre>
A safe level in the muscle tissues of cattle is calculated from the acceptable
daily intake, assuming the average weight of man to be 60 kg and the daily
human intake of muscle to be 500 g, as follows: <p>
<pre>

Safe concentration in muscle =    (60 kg) (0.2 mcg/kg) 
                                 ---------------------   = 24 ppb. 
                                         500 g  

</pre>                                       
When rounded to the nearest 5 ppb the safe concentration in muscle then becomes
25 ppb. The safe concentration of residues in liver, kidney and fat are
determined from this number using appropriate food consumption values (food
factor) for these tissues. Therefore, the safe concentrations are: <p>
Liver:&#160;  25 ppb x 2 (food factor) = 50 ppb<br>
Kidney:&#160; 25 ppb x 3 (food factor) = 75 ppb<br>
Fat: &#160;   25 ppb x 4 (food factor) = 100 ppb <p>
 
<b>C.  Metabolism and Total Residue Depletion Studies</b><p>
 
No additional metabolism or total residue depletion studies were conducted with
ivermectin or clorsulon. <p>
 
<b>D.  Studies Demonstrating a Withdrawal Time:</b> <p>
A study was performed to determine residues in bovine tissues resulting from
dosing the cattle with a subcutaneous injection combination of ivermectin at
0.2 mg/kg B.W. and clorsulon at 2 mg/kg.  The vehicle contained 10 mg/ml
ivermectin and 100 mg/ml clorsulon in 40% v/v glycerol formal and propylene
glycol to make 100% v/v.  Three steers and two heifers were  sacrificed at each
withdrawal time.  The withdrawal times were 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days.  An
additional set of five animals served as controls. <p>
Determinative tissue residue assays using high pressure liquid chromatography
with fluorescence detection for ivermectin were run on all livers (the target
tissue) from this study.  Average residues found were as follows:<p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 8 columns.)</b><P>

<b>Days post dose:</b>   3      7    14     21     28    35   Control

</pre>
  
The analytical method used for these determinations of ivermectin has a lower
limit of reliable measurement of 10 ppb.  The limit of detection is 1-2 ppb. <p>
Determinative tissue residue assays using high pressure liquid chromatography
with ultraviolet detection of clorsulon were run on the kidneys (the target
tissue for clorsulon) from this study. Average residues were as follows: <p>

<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 8 columns.)</b><P>

<b>Days post dose:</b>   3      7    14     21      28    35    Control

 
<b>ppb found:</b>       .54    .08   .01     .01      0   not       0        
                                                   assayed                         

</pre>
 The analytical method used for these determinations of clorsulon has a lower
limit of reliable measurement of .05 ppm and a detection limit of .01 ppm. <p>
The tolerance (Rm) for ivermectin in cattle has been determined to be 15 ppb in
liver, while the Rm for clorsulon has been determined to be 1 ppm in kidneys.
Both determinations have been derived experimentally from toxicity and
metabolism data.  Since the ivermectin tolerance is lower and the residues are
more persistent, withdrawal calculations are based on the ivermectin data to
estimate the withdrawal time.  Statistical analysis of the depletion data using
the upper tolerance limit containing 99 percentile of the population with 95%
confidence yields a withdrawal period of 49 days. <p>
 
<b>E.  Regulatory Methods</b> <p>
<b>Ivermectin Determinative Assay Scheme </b><p>
The determinative assay measures the marker substance, 22, 23-dihydroavermectin
Bla, by high pressure liquid chromatography of a fluorescent derivative.  The
marker substance is extracted into isooctane from an aqueous acetone homogenate
of liver tissue.  The isooctane is removed by evaporation and the extract
purified by a series of acetonitrile-hexane-water distributions.  The
fluorescent derivative is formed by heating with an acetic
anhydride/methylimidazole reagent.  A chloroform solution is purified over a
silica column and concentrated by evaporation; reverse phase liquid
chromatography is carried out using 5:95 water/methanol and fluorescence
detection.  Quantitation is obtained using a standard curve for the marker
substance carried through the derivatization and subsequent steps.  Recoveries
are in the range of 75-95%, and Lm is estimated to be a 10 ppb with a limit of
detection of 1-2 ppb. <p>
 
<b>Ivermectin Confirmatory Assay Scheme</b> <p>
The sample preparation and purification steps of the confirmatory assay are
essentially the same as the determinative assay.  The specificity is obtained
by the production of two new species just prior to derivatization.  The new
species are produced by removing one of the saccharide groups with 1% sulfuric
acid in isopropanol to form the monosaccharide or removing both saccharide
groups with 1% sulfuric acid in methanol to form the aglycone of
22,23-dihydroavermectin Bla.  Since these two treatments are so similar, the
formation of the two new species and their chromatographic properties is unique
and hence confirmation of the presence of 22,23-dihydroavermectin Bla. <p>
In the actual test, the sample is split in three parts.  One part is used for
each of the sulfuric acid treatments.  These samples are separated from the
sulfuric acid by extractions, and fluorescent derivatives of the two new
compounds are made.  The third aliquot is derivatized without pretreatment.
All three derivatives are then extracted into hexane with a small amount of
isobutyl alcohol present.  The liquid chromatographic determination is made as
in the determinative assay.  Three separate peaks are observed at separate
retention times which are compared to standards 
run through the procedure from the point of adding the sulfuric acid onward.
Presence of and quantitation of the three peaks is confirmation that ivermectin
is present. <p>
 
 <b>Validation </b><p>
The determinative and confirmatory methods have been validated satisfactorily
by FDA and USDA laboratories.  The validated regulatory analytical methods for
detection of residues of ivermectin are filed in the Food Additives Manual on
display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857). <p>
<b>7.  Agency Conclusions:</b> <p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and demonstrate that ivermectin and clorsulon (IVOMEC-F) when
administered to cattle by subcutaneous injection at doses of 200 mcg ivermectin
and 2 mg clorsulon per kg are safe and effective for the indications stated on
the product labeling. <p>
Tolerances for ivermectin residues are published in 21CFR 556.344.  The safe
concentrations for total residues of ivermectin in uncooked edible tissues of
cattle are 25 parts per billion in muscle, 50 parts per billion in liver, 75
parts per billion in kidney,and 100 parts per billion in fat.  Tolerances for
clorsulon are published in 21CFR 556.163.  The safe concentration for total
clorsulon residues in uncooked edible cattle tissues are:  muscle, 1.0 part per
million; liver, 2.0 parts per million; kidney, 3.0 parts per million; and fat,
4.0 parts per million.  The tissue residue study submitted demonstrated that
residues of each drug in combination depleted below its safe concentration by
the proposed withdrawal period of 49 days. <p>
Because this drug contains a combination of two previously approved active
ingredients, this application is treated as if it were a category II
application under CVM's supplemental policy. The sponsor demonstrated via
residue depletion studies using the approved regulatory methods that the
depletion characteristics of the marker residue for each drug in the
combination are not significantly modified.  Based on the lack of significant
change in depletion characteristics, CVM concluded that the composition of the
residue for each drug is not changed.  The sponsor also demonstrated that the
existing regulatory method for each drug is not interfered with by residues of
the other drug.  Based on the foregoing, it was not necessary to reevaluate the
underlying toxicity tests supporting the separate approval, or to require
additional metabolism and total residue depletion studies. <p>
Adequate directions for over-the-counter use of this combination product have
been written.  Approved products containing ivermectin and clorsulon alone, for
the same claims as are on the label of the combination product, are on the
market.  CVM is not aware of any reason why the combining of the two products
would require restriction of the new product to prescription use. <p>
Dose confirmation trials conducted with ivermectin, clorsulon, and
ivermectin/clorsulon combination demonstrated that clorsulon given in
combination with ivermectin by the subcutaneous route is effective against
adult <i>F. hepatica  </i>&#160;and has no effect on the efficacy or spectrum of
ivermectin. <p>
Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the act provides a three-year period of exclusivity
to NADAs for previously approved active ingredients because reports of new
clinical trials, field investigations and human food safety studies was
required for approval.<p>

<p>
<b>Route of Administration: </b> Oral administration via the feed. <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b> <p>
Salinomycin sodium (from BIO-COX)   at concentrations ranging 
from 0.0044&#37; to 0.0066&#37; (40-60

Chlortetracycline (from AUREOMYCIN) at a concentration of 0.055&#37; (500 g/ton in
finished feed. <p>

<b>IV. Effectiveness: </b><p>
The approved original  NADA 128-686
for BIO-COX
(salinomycin sodium) (48 FR 30616; 7/5/83) contains adequate data to establish
that salinomycin sodium at a range of 0.0044&#37; to 0.0066&#37; (40-60
g/ton) in finished feed is safe and effective for the prevention of coccidiosis
caused by <i>Eimeria acervulina, E. tenella, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E.
necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati. </i><p>
The approved NADA for salinomycin plus roxarsone, NADA 132-447,
contains adequate data to established that the addition of roxarsone 
(3-Nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic
acid) at a concentration of 0.005&#37; (45.4 g/ton) &#43; salinomycin sodium between
the range of 0.0044 to 0.0083&#37; (40-75
g/ton) is safe and effective for the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler
chickens caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima,
E. brunetti</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati ,</i> including some field strains of <i>E.
tenella</i>&#160; that are more susceptible to roxarsone combined with salinomycin
than the salinomycin alone. <p>
The approved original NADA 48-761,
AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline (32 FR 14155; 10/12/67) contained adequate data to
establish that at concentrations of 500 g/ton in finished feed the drug is safe
and effective as an aid in the reduction of mortality due to <i>E. coli</i>&#160; infections
susceptible to such treatment. <p>
Data supplied in this submission demonstrate that the combination of
salinomycin sodium at concentrations of 0.0044&#37; to 0.0083&#37; (40-75
g/ton) &#43; chlortetracycline at a concentration of 0.055&#37; (500 g/ton) &#43; roxarsone
at a concentration of 0.0050&#37; (45.4 g/ton) is effective for the prevention of
coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by <i>E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E.
tenella, E. maxima, E. brunetti </i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati </i>, including some field
strains of <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; that are more susceptible to roxarsone combined
with salinomycin than salinomycin alone, and as an aid in the  
reduction of mortality due to <i>E. coli</i>&#160; infections susceptible to such
treatment. <p>

<b>A.  Noninterference in Battery Studies </b><p>
<b>Experiment A-86-21
<i>E. coli</i>&#160; Challenge Study </b><p>
Four hundred Hubbard x Hubbard broiler chickens at nine days of age were used
in an adequate, well-controlled
battery study.  The study was conducted in a uniform environment with a 12 hour
light-dark
cycle to test for noninterference of BIO-COX
salinomycin and 3-Nitro
roxarsone with the antibacterial efficacy of AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline. <p>
This study was conducted by using the recommended use level of  
chlortetracycline (500 g/ton).  The experimental treatment groups were as
follows:  uninfected controls (nonmedicated and medicated), infected nonmedicated 
control, and infected groups fed chlortetracycline at 500 g/ton (550
ppm) with or without salinomycin at 75 g/ton (82.5 ppm) and/or roxarsone at
45.4 g/ton (50 ppm) in the diet. <p>
There were four replicate pens per treatment and each pen contained five males
and five females.  At 3 hours post-treatment the nine-day-old birds were
challenged by injection in the right thoracic air sac with a culture containing
approximately 1.4 x 104 cfu per dose of chlortetracycline sensitive <i>E.
coli </i>.  Noninfected control birds were infected similarly with sterile
phosphate buffered saline.  The birds were medicated for 5 days and a 7
day withdrawal period ensued.  Feed consumption and mortality were recorded
daily for each pen.  Birds were weighed at 5 and 12 days post challenge.
Results are in Table 1. Survivors were sacrificed 12 and 13 days post
challenge.  At necropsy, all birds were assigned air sac lesion scores.  Air
sac swabs were cultured in attempts to recover the challenge <i>E. coli</i>.
<p>
The results presented in Table 2 show that chlortetracycline  
incorporated in the diet at 550 ppm (500 g/ton) prevented the  
development of <i>E. coli</i>&#160; induced air-sac
infection in chickens challenged with <i>E. coli </i>.  BIO-COX
salinomycin and 3-Nitro
roxarsone in combination with chlortetracycline did not interfere with the
antibacterial efficacy of chlortetracycline in broilers. <p>

<b>B. Coccidial Challenge Studies:</b><p>
 Two week old Hubbard x Hubbard broiler chickens were used in adequate,
well-controlled battery studies.  The studies were conducted in a uniform
environment with continuous artificial illumination to test for noninterference
of AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline with the anticoccidial effectiveness of BIO-COX
salinomycin in combination with 3-Nitro roxarsone.  Recent field strain
isolates collected from various broiler producing regions of the United States
were used.  For each study, combinations of <i>E. acervulina/E. mivati, E.necatrix</i>&#160;
and <i>E. brunetti</i>&#160; or <i>E. acervulina, E. maxima and E. tenella</i>&#160; were used.
Combinations of three challenge species in each study were used to
differentiate areas of the intestines infected by the parasite.<p>
These studies were conducted by using the lowest recommended use level of
salinomycin (40 g/ton).  The experimental treatment groups were as follows:<p>

In
each of these studies all pens were preselected, birds were randomized by
weight and assigned to cages with ten birds/cage, and four replicates were used
per treatment group.  Groups were medicated two days before infection was
administered.  Evaluations were by lesion scores, (analysis was performed on
preselected birds from each pen), dropping scores, weight gains and feed
conversions.<p>
Salinomycin at 40 g/ton in combination with (3-Nitro) roxarsone at 45 g/ton in
combination with (AUREOMYCIN) chlortetracycline at 500 g/ton provided better
anticoccidial activity than that obtained with either chlortetracycline alone
or unmedicated controls.<p>

<b>V. Animal Safety:</b><p>
The original approved NADA's for salinomycin (NADA 128-686), roxarsone (NADA
7-891) and for chlortetracycline (NADA 48-761) contained adequate data to
establish the safety of each drug for broiler chickens.<p>
The safety of the three drugs when used in combination was demonstrated in the
noninterference battery and coccidial challenge studies described in this
document.  In each of the several studies there was no evidence that drug was
the cause of any mortality or toxicity.<p>
Based on the data in the parent NADA's and from the noninterference battery and
coccidial challenge studies, the combination is safe to be fed to broiler
chickens as indicated on the label.<p>
The data show that the combination of BIO-COX salinomycin at 40-60 g/ton plus
AUREOMYCIN chlortetracycline at 500 g/ton plus roxarsone at 45.4 g/ton in the
feed of broiler chickens fulfills all the requirements for a combination drug
for animals as follows:<ul><p>
<li>A.  Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed effects;<br>
<li>B.  The dosages of each drug component are such that the combination is safe
and effective; and<br>
<li>C.  The label claims are not antagonistic.</ul><p>

<b> VI. Human Safety:</b><p>
<b>A. Data to Support Human Safety</b><p>
The safety of the approved products, salinomycin sodium (BIO-COX) roxarsone
(3-Nitro) and chlortetracycline (AUREOMYCIN) has been established by data
submitted in their respective original NADA's, NADA 128-686, NADA 7-891, NADA
48-761 and Salsbury Master File 19.<p>
The tolerance for residues of chlortetracycline in edible tissue of chicken is
established at 4.0 ppm in kidney and 1.0 ppm in muscle, liver, fat and skin (21
CFR 556.150).  The tolerance for residues of arsenic (due to roxarsone) in
liver is established at 2 ppm (CFR 556.60).  Safe concentrations of total
residues of salinomycin in the edible tissues of chickens are 0.6 ppm for
muscle, 1.8 ppm for liver and 1.2 ppm for skin/fat.  (Safe concentrations refer
to the concentrations of total residues considered safe in edible tissues).
Total residues are highest in liver tissue.  Parent drug salinomycin in
skin/fat was established as the marker residue for total residues in liver.  An
upper limit of 200 ppb (0.2 ppm) for residues of parent drug salinomycin in
skin/fat is established for uses of salinomycin with a zero day withdrawal.<p>

<b>B. Residue Depletion/Non-Interference Studies</b><p>
Residue data supporting the approved individual uses of salinomycin,
chlortetracycline and roxarsone and their withdrawal times of 0 day, 1
day and 5 days, respectively, were submitted in their respective original
applications (see Part A above).<p>
Drug residue elimination and assay noninterference studies were conducted to
establish that each drug in the presence of the other does not exceed its
established safe concentration or tolerance, as applicable, at the proposed
withdrawal time and that none of the drugs interferes in any of the other's
tissue residue assay.<p>
Control chicken muscle, liver, skin and fat were fortified to contain 2.0 ppm
salinomycin, 2.0 ppm roxarsone or 0.50 ppm   chlortetracycline.  The analyses of
these samples by the chlortetracycline microbioassay procedure showed
quantitative recovery of chlortetracycline either in the presence or absence of
salinomycin plus roxarsone.<p>
Control skin/fat tissue homogenates were spiked with combinations of
salinomycin (0.7 ppm) roxarsone (2.0 ppm) and chlortetracycline (1.0 ppm).
Neither chlortetracycline or roxarsone interfered with the tissue residue assay
procedure (HPLC) for salinomycin.<p>
A tissue depletion study was conducted by A.H. Robins Company under protocol
86-0595 at the A.H. Robins Farm in Ashland, VA.  Tissues were obtained from
broiler chickens fed 1 of the following:  
1) unmedicated control diet for 42 days; 2) a diet containing the drug
combination of 75 g/ton salinomycin plus 45 g/ton roxarsone plus 200 g/ton
chlortetracycline for the first 37 days, then a diet containing the drug
combination of 75 g/ton salinomycin plus 45 g/ton roxarsone plus 500 g/ton
chlortetracycline from Day 37 to 42. The medicated group was switched on the
morning of Day 42 to unmedicated control diet, and birds were sacrificed
following drug withdrawal periods of 0 to 7 days.  Tissues were
collected, and tissue levels of residue drug determined for the respective drug
as follows:  salinomycin on Day 0 post withdrawal chlortetracycline at Days
0, 3, 5 and 7 post withdrawal and roxarsone at Days 0, 3 and 7 post withdrawal.
 Tissues from chickens receiving
unmedicated feed during the entire study served as controls with tissues being
collected on Day 42 of the study.<p>
The target tissue for residue depletion studies for salinomycin is skin/fat.
Salinomycin assayed at &lt; .1 ppm in skin/fat, which is below the upper limit
of 0.2 ppm for the marker residue.<p>
At withdrawal days of 0, 3, 5 and 7 all samples assayed for
chlortetracycline residues were well below 1 ppm, the established tolerance.
Kidney tissue was not assayed, as chicken kidney is no longer considered to be
edible tissue.<p>
The depletion of arsenic in the tissues was well below 2.0 ppm, the established
tolerance, at both 3 and 7 days withdrawal time.<p>
The results of the residue depletion study (Table 5) support a five day
withdrawal for this salinomycin chlortetracycline roxarsone combination.<p>

A
regulatory analytical method for salinomycin is not required. Practical
analytical methods for the determination of tissue residues of
chlortetracycline and roxarsone are available in the Food Additives Analytical
Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Room (Room 12A-30, 5600
Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857).<p>

<b> VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and demonstrate that the drug
combination of salinomycin sodium 40-60 g/ton (0.0044-0.0066&#37;) &#43;
chlortetracycline 500 g/ton (0.055&#37;) &#43; roxarsone 45 g/ton (.0050&#37;) in finished
feed for broilers is safe and effective for the indications stated on the
product labeling.<p>
The tolerances for residues of chlortetracycline in edible tissue of chicken
are established at 4.0 ppm in kidney and 1.0 ppm in uncooked muscle, liver, fat
and skin (CFR 556.150).  Safe concentrations of total residues of salinomycin
in the edible tissues of chickens are 0.6 ppm for muscle, 1.8 ppm for liver and
1.2 ppm for skin/fat.  The tolerance for residues of arsenic (due to roxarsone)
is 0.5 ppm in uncooked chicken muscle tissue and 2 ppm in uncooked edible
by-product.  The data submitted in support of the NADA indicates that the
residues of chlortetracycline and arsenic (due to roxarsone) were below the
established tolerance in edible tissues and the residues of salinomycin were
below the safe concentration in the edible tissues.<p>
The five day withdrawal time before slaughter is satisfactory.<p>
Adequate directions for use of the proposed combination in broiler chickens
have been written for the requested claims in this NADA. Products containing
salinomycin and chlortetracycline alone, as well as roxarsone are currently
available over the counter.<p>
The agency has concluded that approval of this new animal drug combination will
not significantly increase human exposure to residue in edible tissues.<p>

   <b>IV.  EFFECTIVENESS </b><p>
   
 <b>Animal Effectiveness</b> <p>
   
 The salinomycin NADA (128-686) established that salinomycin 40 to 60 g/ton
(0.0044 - 0.0066%) is a safe and effective aid "for the prevention of
coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E.
acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti,</i>&#160; and<i> E. mivati</i>."  <p>
   
 NADA 46-920 established the effectiveness of bacitracin zinc (from
Baciferm) for use in broiler rations for increased rate of weight gain and
improved feed efficiency.  The present NADA (139-235) establishes that the
addition of bacitracin zinc to rations containing salinomycin increased rate of
weight gain.  Data provided in this submission demonstrate that rations
containing bacitracin zinc and salinomycin are effective when used at levels of
0.0011% to 0.0055% (10-50 g/ton) for bacitracin zinc and 0.0044% to 0.0066%
(40-60 g/ton) salinomycin and are indicated for the prevention of coccidiosis in
broiler chickens caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E.
maxima, E. brunetti,</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati</i>;&#160; for increased rate of weight gain. <p>
   
<b> A.  Summary of Drug Noninterference Studies </b><p>
   
 Two-week old, Hubbard x Hubbard, broiler chickens were used in adequate,
well-controlled, 2-week, battery studies with approved protocols and were
conducted in a uniform environment with continuous artificial illumination to
test for noninterference of bacitracin zinc with the effectiveness of
salinomycin.  Recent field strain isolates collected from various
broiler-producing regions of the United States were used.  For each study,
combinations of <i>E. mivati, E. brunetti,</i>&#160; and <i>E. necatrix,</i>&#160; or <i>E. acervulina, E.
maxima,</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; were used.  This arrangement facilitated identification
of lesions. <p>
   
 These studies (Tables I and II) were conducted by using the lowest approved
level of salinomycin (40 g/ton).  The experimental treatment groups included
uninfected unmedicated controls, infected unmedicated controls, infected groups
receiving 40 g/ton of salinomycin with and without 100 g/ton bacitracin zinc,
and 100 g/ton bacitracin zinc alone.  the protocols were designed to test for
"noninterference" of each component with the other for the bacitracin
zinc-salinomycin combination. <p>
   
 In each of these studies, all pens were preselected, birds were randomized
by weight and assigned to cages with 10 birds/cage with 4 replicates being used
per treatment group.  Medication was initiated 2 days prior to laboratory
infection.  Evaluations were by lesion scores (analysis was performed on
preselected birds from each pen), dropping scores, weight gains, and feed
conversions. <p>
   
 These studies demonstrate that there is "noninterference" of bacitracin
zinc with the effectiveness of salinomycin.  The combination was
compatible. <p>

 (cont'd) zinc in the presence of salinomycin.  All diets were balanced to
provide adequate levels of nutrients (protein, energy, minerals, etc.).  The
same general experimental design was used in all studies.  All chickens were
maintained from one day of age to market weight.  The studies were conducted in
3 geographical areas. <p>
   
 In these studies, pens were randomly assigned to treatment within blocks,
50-60 birds (one-half male; one-half female) were selected at random and
assigned to pens; 6-8 replicates were used per treatment group.  Salinomycin at
60 g/ton (.0066%) and bacitracin zinc at 0, and 50 g/ton was used on all
studies.  Studies were designed to simulate varying conditions, to include
geographical locations, differences in climate, changes in weather, differences
in management practices, and degree of disease contamination of the
premises. <p>
  
 Data were collected of the evaluation of bacitracin zinc for increasing
rate of weight gain and improving feed efficiency in the presence of the
highest recommended approved use level of the anticoccidial drug (salinomycin,
.0066%).  Parameters of evaluation included mortality, body weight gain and
feed to body weight gain ratio.<p>
   
 Birds medicated with the combinations were healthy throughout the study
periods as evidenced by a survival rate of over 98% for all studies.  There
were no adverse drug effects observed. <p>
   
 A detailed statistical examination of the 3 studies was conducted. Data
were combined over 3 locations and an analysis of variance (weighted by
location) conducted according to block design, and mean differences separated
using the least significant difference test (P&lt;.05).  The combined analysis
of variances demonstrated significant bacitracin effects, i.e., that the 50
g/ton treatment was significantly better for increased rate of weight gain
(P&lt;.01), while in the presence of salinomycin.   The combined individual
treatment means (Table IV and V) illustrates the responses from the
combination. <p>

 These studies demonstrate that there is "non-interference" of bacitracin
zinc with the effectiveness of salinomycin.  Bacitracin zinc is compatible with
salinomycin.<p>  
   
 The above data satisfy the requirement for evaluation of an application
under the CVM Policy outlined in the guidelines for combination drugs revised
October 1983.  The policy provides for the granting of a range approval for
production drugs in combination when the maximum level tested for the claim(s)
is demonstrated to make a significant benefit to the combination. The range
approval according to the revised policy is from 50 g/ton to the minimum level
approved for bacitracin zinc in the parent application.  A minimum use level of
10 g/ton was used in establishing the feed stability data for this combination.
Accordingly, 10 g/ton of bacitracin zinc is the minimum approvable level.
Therefore, use levels approvable for this application are 10-50 g/ton of
bacitracin zinc and 40-60 g/ton of salinomycin in broiler rations.<p>

 <b>V.  ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>  
   
 The original approved NADA's for bacitracin zinc (NADA 46-920) and
salinomycin (NADA 128-686) contained adequate data to establish the safety of
each drug for broiler chickens.<p>  
   
 The safety of a combination of the 2 drugs was demonstrated in the drug
residue elimination study, the floor-pen studies and the compatibility battery
studies described in this document.  Birds in the drug elimination studies were
in good health throughout the study and did not have any gross pathology at
sacrifice.  The birds in the floor-pen and battery studies were healthy
throughout the experimental periods.  Mortality in each study was within an
acceptable range for each facility, and there was no evidence that drug was the
cause of any death. <p> 
   
 Based on the data in the parent NADAs, the compatibility battery studies,
the drug elimination residue study, and the floor-pen studies, we conclude that
the combination is safe to be fed to broiler chickens as indicated by the
label.<p>  
   
 The data provide evidence for the combination of bacitracin zinc 10-50
g/ton and salinomycin at 40-60 g/ton in the feed of broiler chickens that is
consistent with and fulfills all the requirements for a combination drug for
animals as follows:<p>  
   
 A.  Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed
effects.<p>  
   
 B.  The dosage of each drug component are such that the combination is safe
and effective.<p>  
   
 C.  For a significant animal population that is affected by a significant
disease condition, <i>Eimeria tenella</i>&#160; is a major and widespread etiological
organism for coccidiosis and the most pathogenic<i> Eimeria</i>&#160; species for chickens
and, as such, possess the potential of causing extensive economic losses to
broiler producers. <p> 
   
 D.  The label claims are not antagonistic.<p>  
   
  <b>VI.  Human Safety </b> <p> 
   
  <b>A.  Data to Support Human Safety </b> <p>
   
 Safety for the approved products -- bacitracin zinc (Baciferm) and
salinomycin (Bio-Cox)--has been established by data previously submitted in
their respective parent NADA's, NADA 46-920, and NADA 128-686.<p>  
   
 Tolerances for residues of bacitracin zinc in edible tissue of chickens is
established at 0.5 ppm (21 CFR Section 556.70).  Safe concentrations of
salinomycin in the edible tissues of chickens are 0.6 ppm for muscle, 1.8 ppm
for liver and 1.2 ppm for skin/fat.<p>  
   
<b> B.  Residue Depletion/Non-Interference Studies</b><p>  
   
 The residue data supporting the approved individual uses of bacitracin zinc
and salinomycin and their withdrawal times of zero and zero, respectively, have
been submitted in their respective parent applications (see Part A,
above). <p> 
   
 The studies indicated below establish that each drug in the presence of the
other does not influence or exceed the established safe concentration or
tolerance at withdrawal and that they do not interfere in each other's tissue
residue assays.  Residue depletion studies conducted on the three-way
combination of salinomycin, roxarsone, and bacitracin were used to support the
two way combination of salinomycin and bacitracin zinc.<p>  
   
 Under NADA 128-686, a research Rm was established for salinomycin from
birds dosed with salinomycin only.<p>  
   
 Unchanged 14C-Salinomycin was determined by TLC/radiotracer. After 6 hours
withdrawal, unchanged salinomycin was 0.035 ppm in skin/fat with total
salinomycin residues of 0.061 ppm.  Using skin/fat as the target tissue, a
ratio of parent drug to total, residue of 0.57 was calculated at zero
withdrawal.  Thus, the permissible level of unchanged salinomycin (marker) in
skin/fat at zero withdrawal would be equal to the product of the ratio value
and the safe concentration (1.2 ppm) or 0.68 ppm. <p> 
   
 Under NADA 135-746, broilers were dosed for 46 days with the three-way
combination of salinomycin (80 g/ton) /roxarsone (45 g/ton) /bacitracin zinc (100
g/ton).  Six birds were sacrificed at zero withdrawal and skin/fat collected
for determination of salinomycin using a microbiological assay.  The average
salinomycin concentration in skin/fat at zero withdrawal was found to be 29.4
ppb +/- 10.1.  Thus, the concentration of parent salinomycin is
approximately equal to that found in NADA 128-686 and is below the research Rm
of 0.68 ppm.<p>  
   
 Another drug residue elimination study was completed under protocol 84-039
at the A. H. Robins facility in Ashland, Virginia, examining bacitracin zinc
while in the presence of salinomycin and roxarsone.  A total of 30 birds was
reared for control tissue (no drug) and another 30 broilers received the
combination of 0.0088% salinomycin plus. 0.011% bacitracin zinc from day 0 to
day 41.  On day 41 (zero withdrawal) six birds (3 males, 3 females) were
sacrificed from the above combination treatment group and assayed for
bacitracin zinc residue.  Edible tissue assayed was muscle. There was no
bacitracin zinc residue found in any of the muscle tissue at zero day
withdrawal. <p> 
   
 Reference is also made to A. H. Robin NADA P-137-536, which indicates that
spiking of muscle homogenate with various combinations of salinomycin and
bacitracin zinc do not affect the size of salinomycin inhibition zones.
Therefore, bacitracin zinc does not interfere with the salinomycin
assays.<p>  
   
 A non-interference study for bacitracin zinc was conducted by spiking
control muscle tissue with 0.5 ppm bacitracin zinc and 80 ppb of salinomycin.
There were no detectable assay interferences caused by salinomycin when
assaying for bacitracin zinc in chicken muscle.<p>  
   
 A regulatory analystical method for salinomycin is not required. A
practical analytical method for the determination of tissue residue of
bacitracin zinc is available in the Food Additives Analytical Manual on
display in FDA's Freedom of Information Room (Room 12A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, Maryland 20857.<p>  
   
 <b>VII.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p>  
   
 The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that salinomycin (40-60 g/ton) plus
bacitracin zinc (10-50 g/ton) are safe and effective for the claims indicated
in Section III of this FOI Summary. <p> 
   
 Residue depletion studies demonstrating that salinomycin depletes to safe
concentration and bacitracin zinc depletes below tolerance (0.5 ppm) at zero
withdrawal are summarized in this application.<p>  
   
 Under the Center's supplemental policy (42 FR 64367) this original
application is regarded as a Category II supplemental NADA which did not
require reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent NADA's.  The
drugs are to be fed in medicated feeds under the same indications and dosages
as approved in the parent NADA's.<p>  
   
 Non-interference studies demonstrate that salinomycin plus bacitracin zinc
pre ented an outbreak of coccidiosis when the birds were exposed to six major
<i>Eimeria</i>&#160; species that cause the disease.  The data from three well-controlled
floor pen studies demonstrate the effectiveness of bacitracin zinc (50 g/ton)
to increase rate of weight gain in the presence of salinomycin (60 g/ton).  The
CVM policy outlined in the combination drug efficacy guidelines revised October
1983, permits the granting of range approval for bacitracin zinc of 10 to 50
g/ton for increased rate of weight gain in combination with salinomycin 40 to
60 g/ton for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by six major <i>Eimeria</i>&#160;
species.<p>

<p>
<b>g.   Route of Administration:</b> Orally in drinking water<p>  
<b>h.   Species:</b> Turkeys <p>

 <b>i.  Labeled Dosage:</b><p> Administer orally at a dosage of 1,500,000
units of penicillin per gallon (3.8 L) of drinking water for 5 consecutive
days.<p>     
 
 <b>j.  Indication for use:</b><p> For the treatment of erysipelas in
turkeys caused by <i>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae </i>.<p> 

 <b>k.  Pioneer Product:</b><p>    Penicillin G Potassium, USP (NADA 055-060)
by Solvay Animal Health, Inc.<p> 
<b>l.  Date Stamped:</b>  October 18, 1994<p>
  
<b> 2.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
      Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,
drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue
data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i>&#160;  bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>
        Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Sanofi
Animal Health, Inc. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; 
bioequivalence study for penicillin G potassium soluble powder.  The generic
and pioneer products contain the same active ingredient and are water soluble
powders administered as oral solutions.  The generic product contains no
inactive ingredients that may significantly affect the absorption of the active
ingredient.<p>
    <b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance</b><p>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product.  A tolerance of 0.01 ppm in uncooked edible tissues of turkeys is
listed under 21 CFR 556.510 for penicillin G potassium.<p>
<b>Withdrawal Time</b><p>
When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>&#160;  bioequivalence study is
granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product.  <p>
For potassium penicillin G in drinking water (21 CFR 540.181b), discontinue
treatment at least 1 day prior to slaughter of the turkeys.  Not to be used in
turkeys producing eggs for human consumption.<p>
<b>Regulatory Method:</b><p>
The analytical method for the determination of penicillin in tissues uses a
microbiological assay procedure.  This method is found in the <i>Antibiotic
Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues:  Methods, Reports, and
Protocols </i>, revised October 1968, National Center for Antibiotic and Insulin
Analysis, FDA, Washington, D.C. 20204.<p>
<b> 4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
 
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that penicillin G potassium when used under the proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

 <b>m.  Date of Summary:  </b>April 6, 1994<p>

<b>2.     TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a genetic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
genetic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with roxarsone and Baciferm.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this genetic
combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR &#167;  558.550. Lincomycin is codified under 21 CFR &#167;
558.325. Roxarsone (3-Nitro) is codified under 21 CFR &#167;  558.530. The
combination of salinomycin sodium, lincomycin and roxarsone is codified under
21 CFR 558.550(a)(2) and (b)(1)(xiv).<P>
<b>3.    HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, <i>1989, as
</i>published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3 107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<P>
<b>a.    Tolerances/Safe Concentrations for Residues</b><P>
The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<P>
Tolerances for residues of lincomycin in chickens are not required  (21 CFR
&#167;   556.360).<P>
Tolerances of arsenic (from roxarsone) are established at 0.5 ppm in muscle and
2 ppm in edible by-products (21 CFR &#167;  556.60) with liver as the
target tissue.<P>
<b>b.   Withdrawal Time</b><P>
As specified in 21 CFR &#167;  558.550(b)(1)(xiv), a 5-day withdrawal time
is required for the combination of lincomycin, roxarsone and salinomycin.<P>
<b>c.    Regulatory Method for Residues</b><P>
A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels in
all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were significantly
below the established safe concentration for total residues. 
   
A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for lincomycin
residues. The method entitled "Standard Operating Procedure for a Tissue
Residue Study in Broiler Chickens Treated with Lincomycin, U-I0, 149A" is on
file at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500
Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.<P>
A spectrophotometric method is used to assay tissues for roxarsone residues.
The method is entitled "Arsenic (Total) Residues in Animal Tissues,
Spectrophotometric Method" published in AOAC, 14th Edition 41.009, page 777.<P>
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the Act and
demonstrates that the    combination of salinomycin sodium, lincomycin and
roxarsone, when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and
effective for its labeled indications.<P>

For increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in heifers fed
in confinement for slaughter. <p>
 
<b>3.	DOSAGE FORM(S), ROUTE(S) OF ADMINISTRATION AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE</b><p>
 
The dosage form is implantation. The route of administration is subcutaneous
implantation on the posterior aspect of the middle one-third of the ear by
means of an implant gun. The recommended dosage is one implant containing 140
mg trenbolone acetate and 14 mg estradiol. Each implant is made up of seven
pellets with each pellet containing 20 mg trenbolone acetate and 2 mg
estradiol.  Each implant is contained in one division of a multiple dose
cartridge.  There are ten doses in each cartridge.  The cartridge is designed
to be used with a special implant gun which places the implant under the skin
on the posterior aspect of the ear. <p>
<b>4.	EFFECTIVENESS</b> <p>
 <b>Pivotal Studies:</b> <p>
The new animal drug application for REVALOR&#174;-H contains data from
adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the new
animal drug for the indications for use and dosage as given in Sections 2 and 3
above. <p>
 <b>A.	Dose Titration Trials:</b> <p>
In dose titration studies the parameters measured are the same parameters as
are measured in field investigations. The dose titration studies were conducted
using a uniform protocol so that the results of the studies could be pooled and

The purpose of the studies was to determine the dose response for trenbolone
acetate (TBA) and estradiol (E2(Beta)) ear implants on average daily gain and feed
efficiency of confined heifers.  The test animals were cross-bred animals of
European breeds.  There were 7 to 10 animals per pen depending on study
location.  Each treatment was replicated 8 times in all three studies.  The
heifers weighed between 585 (265 kg) to 639 (290 kg) lbs. when the studies were
initiated.  A total of 864 heifers were treated in these three dose titration
studies. <p>
Revalor&#174;-H was given via ear implants.  The implants were placed
subcutaneously on the back side of the mid-ear.  Each dose was made up of the
appropriate number of pellets, with each pellet containing 20 mg TBA and 2 mg
E2(Beta).  The control cattle were not implanted.  The dosages given in each study
were (TBA/E2(Beta)):  0/0, 80/8, 140/14 and 200/20.  The heifers were implanted once
at the initiation of the study.  The length of the studies ranged between 139
and 147 days. <p>
Average daily gain and feed efficiency data are summarized in Table 1 for each
of the three dose titration studies. <p>

A randomized complete block design was used for all studies and the data were
pooled by analysis of variance to determine the significance of the effect of
TBA/E2(Beta) implants on average daily gain and feed efficiency.  There was a
significant (P&lt;.05) dose effect on both average daily gain and feed
efficiency with the maximum response for both parameters plateauing at a dose
of 140 mg trenbolone acetate and 14 mg estradiol.  The 140 mg TBA/14 E2(Beta) mg was
also shown to be significantly (P &lt; .05) better than 200 mg TBA alone and 20
mg E2(Beta) alone.  These data are sufficient to support the claims and dosage as
provided in Sections 2 and 3. <p>
The effects of treatment on carcass parameters (yield grade, quality grade, and
marbling scores) and on the incidence of liver abscesses were evaluated at
slaughter.  At the 140 mg TBA/14 mg E2(Beta) dose, a decrease in marbling scores was
observed.  No effect of treatment was seen in yield grade or the incidence of
liver abscesses.  Because of the observed decrease in marbling scores, the
following statement is required on the label:  Studies have demonstrated that
the administration of Revalor&#174;-H can result in decreased marbling
scores when compared to non-implanted heifers. <p>
 <b>B.	Clinical Field Studies </b><p>
Three (3) clinical field studies were conducted to further confirm the
significant response observed in average daily gain and feed efficiency in the
dose titration studies.  These studies were conducted using a uniform protocol
so that the results could be pooled and summarized.  These studies were also
conducted in the major beef producing areas of the United States. <p>
The test animals were cross-bred animals of European breeds.  There were seven
(7) to eight (8) animals per pen depending upon study location.  Each treatment
was replicated five times (5 pens/treatment) at each location.  The heifers
weighed between 560 (254 kg) and 750 (341 kg) lbs. at the initiation of these
studies.  A total of 230 animals were utilized for these field studies.  The
heifers were fed for 104 to 169 days depending on location. <p>
The heifers were implanted (subcutaneously on the back side of the mid-ear)
once at the initiation of the studies with 200 mg TBA/20 mg E2(Beta) or served as
non-implanted controls. <p>
A randomized complete block design was used for all studies and the data were
pooled by analysis of variance to determine the significance of the effect of
treatment on average daily gain and feed efficiency.  There was a significant
(P&lt;.05) improvement in both average daily gain and feed efficiency for the
heifers implanted with 200 mg TBA/20 mg E2(Beta) when compared to the heifers in the
control group (Table 2). <p>

<b>5.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</b><p>
 
<b>A.	Drug Tolerance Study:</b> <p>
A drug tolerance study was conducted by Prof. H. Zucker at the Institute for
Physiology, School for Veterinary Medicine, University of Munich, Munich, W.
Germany.  The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of an
exaggerated dose.  The test animals were young heifer calves weighing
approximately 140 lbs.  There were three (3) calves in each treatment group.
The heifers were administered TBA/E2(Beta) (mg/mg) at levels of 140/20, 1400/20, and
3500/500.  The parameters measured were clinical observations, gross necropsy,
histology, clinical chemistry, hematology and organ weights.  The high level
3500/500 mg. caused abnormal development of the clitoris and reduction in the
weight of the thymus.  A reduction in ovary weights was seen in all treated
calves.  Proliferation of uterine glandular tissue was observed in heifers from
all treatment groups.  These changes were considered to be due to the hormonal
activity of the test compounds. <p>
<b>B.	Drug Safety Studies:</b> <p>
1.	A target animal safety study was conducted by Dr. A. de Laistre Banting,
Cebiphar, "Les Tombes" Fondettes, 37230 Luynes, France.  The purpose of the
study was to assess the safety to feedlot heifers of TBA and E2(Beta) given
subcutaneously as an ear implant.  Twenty-four (6 per group) Charolais heifers
12-14 months of age and weighing approximately 250 kg. at the initiation of the
study were subcutaneously implanted in the ear with the following dosages of
TBA/E2(Beta) (mg/mg):  0/0 (control), 200/20, 600/60, and 1000/100 per animal.  The
cattle were implanted once at the beginning of the study and the study was
terminated after 140 days.  The parameters measured were clinical signs, animal
health, body weights, clinical biochemistry, and histopathology. <p>
	Individual body weights were recorded on days 28, 56, 112 and 136 post
treatment and venous blood samples were taken for hematological and biochemical
investigations.  The animals were weighed and blood samples taken prior to
treatment.  All cattle were sacrificed and examined post-mortem during week 20
after dosing and tissue samples were preserved in neutral buffered formalin.
All tissues were processed for histopathological examination.  All cattle
remained in good health throughout the study and no clinically abnormal signs
were noted which could be attributed to adverse effects of experimental
treatment.  Animals treated at the recommended dose rate showed an increase in
weight gain as compared to control animals.  No adverse treatment-related
changes of any toxicological significance were observed in biochemical and/or
hematological parameters.  At termination, no significant abnormality was
observed on post-mortem examination.  Weight of the thymus was significantly
lower in groups 3 and 4 as compared to that observed in the control group, the
mean weight of the ovaries tends to be lower in all treated groups.  These
changes were considered to be due to the hormonal action of the test material.
On histopathological examination no microscopic changes of significance due to
the treatment were observed. <p>
2.	A target animal safety study was conducted by Dr. N. L. Roberts, Huntington
Research Center, Huntington, Cambridgeshire, England.  The purpose of the study
was to assess the safety to beef cattle of trenbolone acetate and estradiol
given subcutaneously as an ear implant.  Thirty-two (8 per group) yearling
cattle weighing approximately 407 lbs (185 kg) at the initiation of the study
were given the following dosages of trenbolone acetate/estradiol: control (no
implant), 140/28, 420/84 and 700/140 per animal.  There were four steers and
four heifers in each of the four treatment groups.  The cattle were implanted
once at the beginning of the study and the study was terminated after 160 days.
The parameters measured were clinical signs, body weights, clinical
biochemistry, and histopathology. <p>
	The treatment of beef cattle with TBA/E2(Beta) by subcutaneous implantation at
levels cited above did not result in any adverse effects on clinical health.
Steers in all test groups and heifers in the high dose group showed treatment-
related increases in overall weight gain compared with the control animals.  No
adverse treatment related changes of any toxicological significance were
observed in hematological parameters.  At termination of the study, no
significant macroscopic abnormalities were observed on post-mortem examination,
although prostate and seminal vesicle weights were significantly greater in
treated steers and uterine and ovarian weights were greater in treated heifers,
compared with controls.  These changes were considered to be due to the
hormonal action of the test materials.  On histopathological examination of
tissues from the control and high dose group, both prostate and seminal
vesicles showed moderate glandular development with secretion in treated steers
as compared with poor development in controls as a result of castration.  In
females, mammary acinar development was moderate in treated animals and minimal
in controls.  No other microscopic changes of significance were observed.
These changes were considered to be due to the hormonal action of the test
materials. <p>
 
<b>6.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><p>
 
<b>A.	Toxicity Tests</b> <p>
	The toxicity studies summarized in the FOI under NADA 138-612 (52 FR 24994 -
July 2, 1987) have met the agency's requirement for human food safety for
trenbolone acetate.  Allowable incremental increases of estradiol have been
established by the agency under 21 CFR 556.240. <p>
<b>B.	Safe Concentration of Residues</b> <p>
	Under NADA 138-612, trenbolone acetate, it was determined that the safe
concentration for total residues of trenbolone was 50 ppb for muscle, 100 ppb
for liver, 150 ppb for kidney and 200 ppb for fat.  The total average
trenbolone residues in beef liver were determined to be 43.8 ppb and 50.5 ppb
at 15 and 30 days, respectively.  The residues in muscle, kidney and fat were
much lower. <p>
<b>C.	Residue Depletion Study </b><p>
	A tissue residue study was conducted to determine the residues of estradiol
and the two metabolites of trenbolone acetate (17(alpha)-hydroxytrenbolone (17(alpha)-TBA)
and 17(Beta)-hydroxytrenbolone (17(Beta)-TBA)).  This residue analysis was conducted by
Dr. Donald Henricks, Clemson University, Clemson, SC. <p>
	Eight (8) heifers were treated with 180 mg trenbolone acetate and 18 mg
estradiol.  There were also four (4) control heifers in the study.  In each
treatment group, four heifers were sacrificed 15 days after treatment and the
remaining four were sacrificed 30 days after implantation.  Muscle, liver,
kidney and fat samples were collected from each animal at the time of
sacrifice.  After collection, samples were immediately frozen in dry ice and
held frozen until they were assayed for estradiol, 17(alpha)-TBA and  
	17(Beta)-TBA. <p>
	For estradiol levels, the purpose of the study was to determine the residue
levels in the treated animals and compare them to the allowable incremental
increases permitted under 21 CFR 556.240.  The results are shown in Table 3. <p>

	The results of the estradiol assays from the treated and control animals were
compared to the allowable incremental increases permitted under 21 CFR 556.240.
When the residues of estradiol in the treated animals were compared to the
naturally occurring levels in the untreated controls they were found to be much
lower than the allowable incremental increases. <p>
	For trenbolone acetate residues, the purpose of the study was to determine the
residue levels in the treated animals and compare them to the residues incurred
with the approved Finaplix&#174;-H implant (200 mg trenbolone acetate
alone).  The residues of  
	17(alpha)-TBA and 17(Beta)-TBA are reported in Table 4. <p>
	When the combined residues of the two trenbolone metabolites (17(alpha)-TBA + 17(Beta)-
                                                                             
TBA)
are compared between the two implant groups, the residues from the
Revalor&#174;-H implant were less than the combined residues in
heifers treated with only 200 mg of trenbolone acetate.  Because residues of
17(Beta)-TBA were generally higher in the Revalor&#174;-H treated animals
than in the 200 mg TBA group, and because liver residues of 17(Beta)-TBA were the
highest relative to the 200 mg TBA group, a statistical analysis of the 17(Beta)-TBA
liver residues was conducted to show that the mean residues values in
Revalor&#174;-H treated heifers were not significantly different from
the values in heifers treated with 200 mg of TBA alone.  Liver residues of
17(Beta)-TBA resulting from the use of Revalor&#174;-H were not
significantly different from the residues of 17(Beta)-TBA resulting from the use of
200 mg of trenbolone acetate alone at either 15 or 30 days (p=0.201 and
p=0.815, respectively).  Furthermore, the combined levels of 17(alpha)-TBA and
17(Beta)-TBA were less than the combined amounts of these residues for the 200 mg
TBA implant which is approved. <p>

	Residues of estradiol in heifers treated with Revalor&#174;-H are
many times lower than the allowable incremental increases permitted under 21
CFR 556.240.  Residues of 17(Beta)-trenbolone
in the tissues of heifers treated with Revalor&#174;-H are not
statistically different from the residues of 17(Beta)-TBA incurred following
implantation with the currently approved implant containing 200 mg of
trenbolone acetate alone.  The combined trenbolone residues (17(alpha)-TBA + 17(Beta)-TBA)
are lower in the heifers treated with Revalor&#174;-H than in the
heifers treated with 200 mg trenbolone acetate alone.  As such, a withdrawal
period is not required following the use of Revalor&#174;-H. <p>
<b>E.	Regulatory Method </b><p>
	Since a withdrawal period is not required for the use of
Revalor&#174;-H, neither a regulatory or confirmatory method were
required for this approval. <p>
<br>
<b>7.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b> <p>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that the data submitted in
support of this New Animal Drug Application satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act.  The data demonstrate that Revalor&#174;-H (trenbolone
acetate and estradiol) is safe and effective to increase the rate of weight
gain and improve feed efficiency in heifers fed in confinement for slaughter,
when used in accordance with its labeled conditions of use.
Revalor&#174;-H was shown to provide improvement over each compound
used alone, in compliance with 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v). <p>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this NADA qualifies for three years of marketing exclusivity because new
clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
were essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by
the applicant. <p>
The Center has concluded that Revalor&#174;-H is safe for
over-the-counter (OTC) use.  Directions on the labeling and packaging are
adequate and ear implantation is a common method of administration of this type
product within the feedlot industry.  Producers who use this product can be
expected to safely and successfully accomplish implantation.  Further, there is
no special need to recognize a disease condition, the drugs are not "controlled
substances," and after implantation there is no need for medical monitoring or
evaluation of the treated animal.  Accordingly, prescription restriction of
this product is not warranted. <p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the  
Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, an abbreviated new animal
drug  
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal  
drug (pioneer product). New target animal safety data, drug effectiveness data,
and human  
food safety data (other than tissue residue data) are not required for approval
of an  
ANADA. An ANADA relies on the target animal safety, drug effectiveness and
human food  
safety data in the pioneer's new animal drug application. Ordinarily, the ANADA
sponsor  
shows that the generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer. If
bioequivalence is  
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish  
the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required. For certain
dosage forms, the  
agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study (55
FR 24645,  
June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April
1990).<p>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, AgriLabs,
Ltd. was  
granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study for
sulfadimethoxine oral  
solution. The generic and pioneer products are oral solutions with the same
active and  
inactive ingredients. The generic and pioneer products also contain the same  
concentration of active ingredient.<p>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance for the marker residue:</b><p>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product.<p>
A tolerance of 0.1 ppm is established for sulfadimethoxine residues in the
edible tissues of  
chickens, turkeys and cattle under 21 CFR 556.640.<p>

<b>Withdrawal Period:</b><p>
When a waiver of the <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study is granted, the withdrawal
times are the  
same as those previously assigned to the pioneer product.<p>
For sulfadimethoxine 12.5% drinking water solution, a withdrawal period of five
days has  
been established for chickens and turkeys, and a withdrawal period of seven
days has  
been established for cattle.<p>

<b>Regulatory Method:</b><p>
The analytical method for the determination of sulfadimethoxine in tissue uses
a thin layer-densitometric procedure. This method is found in the <i>Official Methods of
Analysis of the  
Association of Official Analytical Chemists</i>, 15th edition, 1990.<p>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that  
sulfadimethoxine oral solution, when used under its proposed conditions of use,
is safe  
and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

<B>4. ANIMAL EFFICACY</B><p>
This NADA provides for the use of Veteeze&#174; (diazepam) as a preanesthetic agent
to reduce the quantity of barbiturates required to induce anesthesia.<p>
Effectiveness for the recommended indication has been established on the basis
of a laboratory dose titration study and four well-controlled field trials
validating <I>in vivo</I>&#160; activity under clinical conditions.<p>

A blinded titration study was conducted to determine the dose of Veteeze
(diazepam) required as a preanesthetic drug to reduce the amount of barbiturate
required to achieve anesthesia in dogs. The barbiturate, thiamylal sodium, was
used to induce anesthesia, as indicated by achieving endotracheal intubation,
in dogs. The parameter measured was the amount of thiamylal required to achieve
intubation. Subsequent to intubation, the dogs were maintained on Halothane.
Diazepam dosage was evaluated at 0 (placebo), 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg b.w.,
intravenously. Twenty-four (12 male, 12 female) mixed breed dogs weighing 15-25
kg were randomly assigned to six replicates of a 4 x 4 Latin square. Every
animal received each dose, thus providing 24 dogs per treatment. Following a
treatment cycle, all dogs were rested for 3 weeks before the next treatment
cycle was started. The quantity of thiamylal required to achieve endotracheal
intubation was measured. The dogs were monitored for drug effect on respiration
rate, heart rate and body temperature, and any visible signs of drug effect,
including depression, anger or vocalization. Time to achieve extubation, and
sternal and standing recovery were noted.<p>
Diazepam or placebo was injected 3-5 minutes prior to the anesthetic thiamylal
sodium, which was administered until endotracheal intubation was possible. The
dose used was blinded to the person administering the drug and making the
observations.<p>
<b>Results:</b><p>
0.2 mg group used 8.261 mg/kg thiamylal (22&#37; reduction)<br>
0.1 mg group used 9.097 mg/kg thiamylal (14&#37; reduction)<br>
0.05 mg group used 9.293 mg/kg thiamylal (12&#37; reduction)<br>
Control group used 10.6 mg/kg thiamylal<p>
Statistical analyses of the data show that the intravenous administration of
diazepam at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg of body weight decreased (P &#60; .05) the
amount of thiamylal sodium required to achieve intubation. It was further shown
that the 0.2 mg/kg intravenous dose of Veteeze reduced the amount of thiamylal
required over that of the 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg dose levels (P &#60; .05).<p>
No adverse reactions were observed. No treatment differences were noted for
respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, demeanor or recovery time
associated with the four treatment levels.<p>
Four clinical field studies, comprising a placebo, 0.10 and 0.20 mg/kg bw
groups, administered IV doses of diazepam, were conducted to confirm that the
dose of 0.2 mg was consistently more effective than the 0.1 mg dose in reducing
the amount of anesthetic required for endotracheal intubation. Note clinical
studies C-88-23, C-89-10, C-89-13 and C-89-14.<p>
It is concluded that the 0.2 mg/kg of body weight dose of Veteeze administered
by the intravenous route is the appropriate dose to reduce the amount of a
barbiturate required for endotracheal intubation in dogs.<p>

Dr. Robert McLain<br>
Addison, Illinois<p>
A blinded, well-controlled study was conducted in dogs to determine the amount
of thiamylal required to induce anesthesia following the intravenous use of
Veteeze (diazepam) as a preanesthetic agent. Ninety (90) dogs of various
breeds, age and sex, which were surgical candidates from routine hospital
admissions, were randomly assigned by a computer-generated schedule to
treatments of 0.1, 0.2 mg/kg body weight of diazepam (as Veteeze Injection) or
sterile water placebo. Veteeze or the placebo was given 3 to 5 minutes prior to
administration of thiamylal which was administered intravenously until
endotracheal intubation was possible. The amount of thiamylal required for
satisfactory endotracheal intubation was measured. Animals were monitored for
drug effect on heart rate, respiratory rate and levels of depression, anger and
aggression.<p>
Results were as follows:<p>

at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg bw in reducing the amount of barbiturate required for
endotracheal intubation.<p>
Statistical analyses of the pooled data from the four studies showed that the
average 20&#37; reduction in thiamylal use is significant (P &#60; .017).<p>

A summary of the amount of thiamylal used within various age groups are
presented in Table 1. The results consistently showed that there was no
treatment effect on the physiological variables, leading to the conclusion that
Veteeze has no effect on body temperature, heart rate or respiratory rate. Only
one significant difference (change in depression score to an increase in the
0.2 mg group) was observed and no treatment effect was observed on anger or
vocalization. A summary of the distribution of ages, and of the procedures
performed, by center, are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.<p>

<B>5. Animal Safety</B><p>
<B>Four-week Intravenous Toxicity Study in Dogs with Diazepam Solutions</B><p>
<B>Investigator:</B><p>
B. Schlappi<br>
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.<br>
Toxicology Department<br>
Basle, Switzerland<p>
The purpose of the study was to compare the tolerance in dogs to commercial
injectable diazepam that: (1) had been stored under optimal conditions; (2) had
been heat stressed; or (3) contained added principal degradation products.<p>
Four dogs (2 male, 2 female) were assigned to each treatment group and were
injected intravenously with 1 mL Veteeze (5 mg diazepam)/kg daily for a period
of 30 days.<p>
Group 1: Control group (sterile saline)<br>
Group 2: Injectable diazepam (fresh or optimally stored)<br>
Group 3: Injectable diazepam (not optimally stored - heat stressed)<br>
Group 4: Injectable diazepam (degradation products added)<p>
Monitoring activities included daily weighing and observations, hematology,
serum chemistries, urinalysis, ophthalmologic exams, ECG, autopsies and
histology.<p>
In all three groups treated with injectable diazepam, the same type and degree
of findings were noted, principally:<p><UL>
<LI>A minimal increase in bilirubin (control mean 0.08, treated groups 0.11 mg/100
ml), cholesterol (control mean 126, treated groups 208 mg/100 ml) and ALT
(SGPT-control 21, treated groups 28)<p>
<LI>A moderate to marked increase of alkaline phosphatase. Dogs in control group
levels were 111 and group 2 had increased levels up to 416 U/L<p>
<LI>Increased liver weights were observed in the treated groups. On an absolute
basis the mean liver weight of the control dogs was 325 gms vs 434 for the
medicated dogs. Adjusting for differences in average body weights of each
group, the relative increase (i.e. gms liver/kg body weight) was approximately
15&#37;.<p>
<LI>Intracanalicular cholestatsis was observed more often in the treated
groups.<p></UL>

Ataxic gait and sedation were observed for approximately three hours after
injection, mainly during the first experimental week. An increase in appetite
was also observed in treated animals.<p>
From day 16 of the study onward, subcutaneous injections were necessary in some
of the dogs in groups 1, 2, and 3 because of hardening of the vessels from
continuous intravenous injections. Hematology, urinalysis, ophthalmology and
ECG findings were within normal limits.<p>
This 30-day dosing at 25 times the approved level confirms the safety of the
preanesthetic dose of 0.2 mg a.i./kg b.w. of injectable diazepam in the dog
(a.i. means active ingredient).<p>
<B>Acute Toxicity Studies for Injectable Diazepam and the Diazepam Vehicle in
Dogs</B><p>
<B>Investigator:</B><p>
D. Hane<br>
Hoffman-La Roche Inc.<br>
Toxicology Department<br>
Nutley, New Jersey<p>
The purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare the acute toxicity of
injectable diazepam and of the diazepam vehicle in dogs.<p>
Sixteen beagle dogs, (two of each sex per test group), received four
intravenous injections of diazepam (2 mg a.i./mL) or the vehicle given at 2-3
day intervals.<p>
All dogs survived the 0.15, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 mL/kg intravenous doses of
injectable diazepam (2 mg a.i./mL), equivalent to 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg
of the active ingredient, or 0.15, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 mL/kg doses of the vehicle.
Transient ataxia and general decrease in motor activity occurred following
administration of diazepam. Emesis occurred in one dog each at 0.5, 1.5, and 5
mL/kg doses of diazepam and at the highest dose, 5 mL/kg, of the vehicle. A
transient decrease in motor activity occurred in one dog receiving 5 mL/kg of
the vehicle. Increases occurred in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
(control/baseline of 31 IU/L to 46 IU/L in the 10 mg/kg group) and alkaline
phosphatase values (control/baseline of 67 IU/L to 334 IU/L in the 10 mg/kg
group) of diazepam-treated animals compared to their own baseline values and
compared to vehicle-treated controls. Other changes (urea nitrogen predose of
12 mg/dL to 16 mg/dL in the 10 mg/kg group) in serum clinical chemistry values
of both diazepam- and vehicle-dosed dogs were not considered biologically
significant. In the dogs receiving vehicle intravenously, salivation, licking,
emesis and decreased motor activity occurred following the 1.5 and 5 ml/kg
doses. An increase in glucose values was noted at 8 and 15 days after the final
dose of vehicle (glucose from 110 mg/dL in the control to 124 mg/dL in the 10.0
mg/kg group and in the vehicle group).<p>
The final administration of diazepam was 50 times (10 mg/kg body weight I.V.)
the preanesthetic dosage of 0.2 mg/kg body weight I.V. All dogs survived the
doses and the 15-day observation period following the four incremental
administrations of injectable diazepam or vehicle, which affirms the safety of
Veteeze in dogs.<p>

<B>Investigators:</B><p>
W. Pool<br>
D. Suckow<br>
Hoffman-La Roche Inc.<br>

Nutley, New Jersey<p>
The purpose of the study was to determine the drug tolerance of diazepam
administered intravenously to dogs. Three dogs each (weighing 8-11 kg) were
injected with either 5, 10, or 20 mg diazepam/kg b.w. as a single dose.<p>
Diazepam at 5 and 10 mg/kg I.V. produced ataxia and sedation, while 20 mg/kg
I.V. produced hypnosis for 30-60 minutes. All dogs survived and were considered
normal by 48 hours postdosing.<p>
Three out of three dogs surviving a dose 100 times (i.e., 20 mg/kg b.w., I.V.)
the preanesthetic dose of diazepam (0.2 mg/kg b.w., I.V.) reaffirms the safety
of diazepam in dogs.<p>
<B>Toxicity of Diazepam in Dogs by Repeated Intravenous Doses</B><p>
<B>Investigator:</B><p>
R. E. Bagdon<br>

Nutley, New Jersey<p>
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the tolerance of dogs to repeated
injections of diazepam (5 mg a.i./mL) with doses of 10 mg diazepam
intravenously 5 days/week for four weeks. A control group received 2 mL I.V. of
the vehicle. Four dogs (2 male, 2 female) were assigned to each group. The
average starting weight of the dogs was 8.36 kg (6.7-10.2 kg). The group given
10 mg diazepam I.V. received the equivalent of 1.1 mg of diazepam per kg of
body weight.<p>
Group 1, four dogs were administered 10 mg in 2 ml diazepam I.V. for five days
for four weeks. Group 2 Controls, two dogs were administered 2 ml of vehicle
I.V. for 5 days for four weeks.<p>
In group 1, dogs given 10 mg of diazepam I.V., transient ataxia was observed,
but they were normal within one hour after the drug was given. Sedation was not
observed in these animals.<p>
In the control group dogs given the vehicle, no toxic effects were observed.<p>
The results of the hematology, serum chemistries and urinalyses carried out
before treatment and during the 2nd and 4th experimental weeks were within the
normal range.<p>
In both the control and diazepam treated animals, the injection sites were
firm, with local fibrosis and occasional foci of necrotic tissue and
hemorrhage. Thickening of the veins used for I.V. administration and localized
irritation of the tissues surrounding the injection sites occurred in both
control and treated animals.<p>
Following sacrifice of animals in both groups, the animals were observed for
gross pathological changes and apart from localized irritation at the sites of
injection, no evidence of gross pathology was seen in the animals. The
localized irritation did not differ significantly between control and
diazepam-treated animals, indicating that these localized effects were produced
by the injection <I>per se</I>.<p>
Administration of injectable diazepam to dogs did not result in toxic
manifestations; no changes in blood counts, liver, kidney and pancreatic
function were observed. No histopathological changes, other than irritation at
the injection sites, were noted.<p>
These findings, after 20 intravenous doses of 5 times the single preanesthetic
dose of 0.2 mg/kg b.w. during a four week period, confirm the safety of
diazepam in the dog.<p>
<B>Toxicity of Diazepam in Dogs by Repeated Daily 10X Doses</B><p>
<B>Investigator:</B><p>
R. E. Bagdon<br>

Pharmacology Department<br>
Nutley, New Jersey<p>
The tolerance of four dogs to 4 mL of either injectable diazepam (5 mg a.i./mL)
administered as 10 intravenous or intramuscular injections over a period of two
weeks was determined in this study. Based on an average body weight of 10.2 kg,
each dog received 10 doses of 2 mg/kg b.w. each. Following intravenous
administration, both animals displayed marked muscle relaxation, loss of
righting reflex and ataxia, which disappeared approximately 30 minutes
post-dosing.<p>
Hematology and blood chemistry values before treatment and following the 10th
injection remained within normal ranges. Gross and histopathologic examination
of organs and tissues in the I.V. group were within normal limits when compared
to controls.<p>
The results of this study in which the animals received 10 intravenous doses of
2 mg/kg b.w. during a period of two weeks, i.e., each dose equivalent to 10
times the preanesthetic dosage of 0.2 mg/kg b.w., confirms the safety of
diazepam in the dog.<p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-027;
generic nicarbazin), Planalquimica Industrial Ltda. is entitled to the approval
of generic nicarbazin in combination with lincomycin.  Bioequivalence studies
are not required for the approval of this generic combination (Type C medicated
feed).  Nicarbazin is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.366.  Lincomycin is
codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.325.  The combination of nicarbazin and
lincomycin is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.325(c)(3)(xii) and
&#167;558.366(c).<P>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
<b>Tolerances for Marker Residues </b><P>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product.  <P>
A tolerance of 4.0 ppm is established for residues of nicarbazin in uncooked
chicken muscle, liver, skin, and kidney under 21 CFR &#167;556.445.<P>
A tolerance for residues of lincomycin in chickens is not required under 21 CFR
&#167;556.360.<P>
<b>Withdrawal Time</b><br>
<br>
A 4-day withdrawal time is established for chickens receiving the
combination of nicarbazin and lincomycin under 21 CFR &#167;558.366.  A tissue
residue depletion study submitted under ANADA 200-027 supports the use of the
pioneer drug withdrawal time for the generic nicarbazin product.<P>
<b>Regulatory Methods for Residues</b><P>
The determinative procedure for quantifying nicarbazin residues in chicken
tissues is a liquid chromatographic assay with UV detection of
4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the marker residue for nicarbazin.  The identity
of DNC is confirmed by thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
The reference for the regulatory method is:  J.L. Lewis, T.D. Macy, and D.A.
Garteiz; <i>J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem.</i> <b>72</b>(4):  577-581.<P>
A regulatory method for residues of lincomycin in chicken tissues was not
required under NADA 034-085 because edible tissue residue levels were all below
the established safe concentration for total residues.<P>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of nicarbazin and lincomycin, when used under
its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled
indications.<P>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460,
December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data, drug
effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer and conducts a tissue residue
study to establish the withdrawal time for the generic product.   For certain
dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>
bioequivalence study (60 FR 11097, March 1, 1995, Bioequivalence Guideline (draft) 1994).<p>

Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, The Upjohn
Company was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in  vivo</i>  bioequivalence
study for spectinomycin hydrochloride.  The generic and pioneer products are
injectable products with the same active ingredients and no differences in the
inactive ingredients which would affect absorption of the active ingredients.<p>


<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>

<i>Tolerance</i><p>

Spectinomycin was approved based on the negligible tolerance concept.  A
negligible tolerance has been applied to animal drug residues when the
supporting toxicological data are of subchronic (90-day) duration.  The
"negligible tolerance" concept is based on two precepts: (1) the residue
present is at a level of insignificance and (2) the safety of the residue is
supported by limited toxicological data.  The upper level for a drug residue to
qualify for "negligible tolerance" is considered customarily to be 0.1 part per
million (ppm) residue in tisssue.  Therefore, the tolerance for spectinomycin
residues in edible tissue is the same for all species in which the drug is
approved.  Accordingly, 21 CFR 556.600 is amended to apply the tolerance of 0.1
ppm to edible turkey tissues.<p>

The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.  A tolerance of 0.1 ppm is established for negligible residues of
spectinomycin in the uncooked edible tissues of chickens and turkeys under 21
CFR 556.600.<p>

<i>Withdrawal Time</i><p>

A withdrawal period for the use of spectinomycin in 1 to 3-day-old turkey
poults and newly-hatched chicks is not required.<p>

<i>Regulatory Method</i>:<p>

A regulatory method for residues for the use of spectinomycin in 1 to 3-day-old
turkey poults and newly-hatched chicks is not required<p>

<b>4.AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>

This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that undetermined TRADEMARK Injectable (spectinomycin
di-hydrochloride pentahydrate) when used under the proposed conditions of use,
is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

<b>Date of Summary:  </b>March 28, 1994<p>
<b>2.    TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30,  1990  (55 FR 3107),
following the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article
(ANADA 200-075; generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company
is entitled to the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with
roxarsone and bacitracin zinc. Bioequivalence studies are not required for the
approval of this generic combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin
sodium is codified under 21 CFR &#167;  558.550. Bacitracin zinc is
codified under 21 CFR &#167;  558.78. Roxarsone (3-Nitro) is codified
under 21 CFR &#167;  558.530. The combination of salinomycin sodium,
bacitracin zinc and roxarsone is codified under 21 CFR &#167;  558.550(a)
and (b)(1)(viii).<p>
<b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<p>
<b>a.    Tolerances/Safe Concentrations for Residues</b><p>
The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<p>
Tolerances for residues of bacitracin from bacitracin zinc are established at
0.5 ppm negligible residues in uncooked edible tissues of chickens (21 CFR
&#167;  556.70).<p>
Tolerances of arsenic (from roxarsone) are established at 0.5 ppm in muscle and
2 ppm in edible by-product (21 CFR &#167;  556.60) with liver as the
target tissue.<p>
<b>b.    Withdrawal Time</b><p>
As specified in 21 CFR &#167;  558.550(b)(1)(viii), a 5-day
withdrawal time is required for the combination of bacitracin zinc, roxarsone
and salinomycin.<p>
<b>c.    Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels in
all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were significantly
below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>
A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for bacitracin
residues. The method entitled "Modified Microbiological Method for
Determination of Bacitracin in Tissues" is on file at the Center for Veterinary
Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD
20855.<p>
A spectrophotometric method is used to assay tissues for roxarsone residues.
The method is entitled "Arsenic (Total) Residues in Animal Tissues,
Spectrophotometric Method" published in AOAC, 14th Edition 41.009, page 777.<p>
<b>4.    AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of salinomycin sodium, bacitracin zinc and
roxarsone, when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and
effective for its labeled indications.<p>

<b>4. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), as
amended
by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA) of 1988,
an
abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic
version
of an approved new animal drug (pioneer product). New target animal safety
and
effectiveness data and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not
required for approval of an ANADA; ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic
product is bioequivalent to the pioneer, and the ANADA relies on the target
animal safety
and effectiveness and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
in the new
animal drug application (NADA) for the pioneer. If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through
a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to establish the
withdrawal time for
the generic product is also required. For certain dosage forms, the agency will
grant a
waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645,

1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Pfizer was
granted a
waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study for the generic
product,
Neomycin Soluble Powder. The generic product is administered as an oral
solution,
contains the same active ingredient in the same concentration and dosage form
as the
pioneer product, and contains no inactive ingredients that may significantly
affect
absorption of the active ingredient. The pioneer product is Neomix 325
(neomycin sulfate
soluble powder) the subject of the Upjohn Company's NADA 11-315, approved on
March
21, 1958, as upgraded by the approval on March 4, 1992 (see 57 FR 19084; May
4,
1992), of a supplemental NADA bringing the product into compliance with FDA
conclusions, based in part on the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research
Council Drug Efficacy Study Group evaluation of the product, regarding
indications for use
and labeling, among other things.<p>
<b>5. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance</b><p>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product apply to the generic product.
A tolerance
of 0.25 ppm is already established for edible tissues of cattle (excluding veal
calves),
swine, sheep and goats, and a tolerance of 0.15 ppm for milk (21 CFR
556.430).<p>
<b>Withdrawal Time</b><p>
When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study is
granted, the
withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer product. The
withdrawal
times for neomycin sulfate soluble powder are established in 21 CFR 558.20: 30
days for
cattle (excluding veal calves), goats and 20 days for swine and sheep.<p>
<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological
test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>&#160; suspension. The method is as published by
the
Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products and
Animal
Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols", revised October 1968, reprinted
December
1974.<p>
<b>6. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the act and
demonstrates that
neomycin sulfate soluble powder, when used under its proposed conditions of
use, is safe
and effective for the labeled indications. The approval provides for use of
neomycin sulfate
soluble powder for the treatment and control of colibacillosis (bacterial
enteritis) caused by
<i>Escherichia coli</i>&#160; susceptible to neomycin sulfate in cattle (excluding veal
calves), swine,
sheep, and goats.<p>
Neomycin sulfate soluble powder (the pioneer product) for use in food-producing
animals
is currently on the market as an over-the-counter product. Therefore, the
Center for
Veterinary Medicine has concluded that this generic product should have
over-the-counter
marketing status.<p>

<b>4.Effectiveness:</b><p>

Primor is an antimicrobial drug containing sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim in a
five to one ratio.  Ormetoprim is used as a potentiator to enhance the
antibacterial effect of the active ingredient.<P>
A potentiator of a systemic antimicrobial agent is a substance used to augment
the antibacterial spectrum of the active ingredient by protecting it from
bacterial enzyme inactivation or by affecting the metabolic pathways of
microorganisms at different points than the active ingredient.  A potentiator
is not an active ingredient per se that would be used alone therapeutically.
Therefore, Primor is not a combination drug.<P>
The effectiveness of Primor was established by the following pivotal
studies.<P>
A. Pivotal Studies:<P>
1. <I>In vitro</I> Laboratory Studies:<P>
a. Determination of Optimum Ratio of Sulfadimethoxine (SDM) to Ormetoprim
(OMP).<P>
Dr. G. Maestrone, Hoffmann-La Roche, determined the antibacterial activity of
various ratios of SDM and OMP against three gram negative and three gram
positive canine origin bacterial isolates in Mueller Hinton broth.  The optimum
ratio of SDM plus OMP was selected by determining the antibacterial activity of
the two compounds singly as well as at ratios ranging from 1 part of SDM to
1280 parts of OMP and vice versa.  The maximum synergistic effect was obtained
at the 5:1 ratio of SDM to OMP.<P>
The organisms tested were:<br>
<i>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</i> (ASR No 82)<br>
<i>Streptococcus beta-hemolyticus</i> (ASR No 78)<br>
<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (ASR No 141)<br>
<i>Escherichia coli</i> (ASR No 89)<br>
<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (ASR No 801)<br>
<i>Proteus vulgaris</i> (ASR No 803)<P>
The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of the six strains was averaged
and is reported in Table 1.<P>
The lowest FIC value (optimum ratio) 0.0778 was obtained when SDM and OMP were
present at the 40:1 ratio, followed very closely by values of 0.0871 for the
5:1 ratio, and of 0.0910 for the 10:1 ratio, indicating very low FIC values for
a wide range of SDM:OMP ratios.<P>
Pharmacokinetic considerations favored the 5:1 ratio of sulfadimethoxine and
ormetoprim.<br>

b. Comparative Evaluation of the Susceptibility of 754 Canine Origin Bacterial Strains to 5:1, 
20:1 and 80:1 SDM + OMP Ratios<p>

A comparative evaluation of the susceptibility of 754 bacterial strains of
canine origin to SDM and OMP at ratios of 5:1, 20:1 and 80:1 indicates no
difference in the activity of the three ratios evaluated; except for the
difference between the activity of the 5:1 and the 80:1 ratio against gram
negative strains.  This study was performed by Dr. G. Maestrone, Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc.<P>
Twenty-five mcg potency discs were used in this study which included 344 gram
positive strains representing six genera and 410 gram negative strains
representing seven genera.  Incidence of resistance of the gram positive
strains to SDM was 28%, that of the gram negative strains was 47%, with an
overall incidence of 39% resistance to SDM.<p>
Among the gram positive strains there was an overall 8, 9 and 11% incidence of
resistance to the 5:1, 20:1 and 80:1 SDM + OMP ratio, respectively.  Only 27,
31 and 36% of the 98 SDM resistant strains were resistant to the SDM + OMP 5:1,
20:1 and 80:1 ratios.<P>
Among the gram negative strains there was an overall 27, 29 and 34% incidence
of resistance to the 5:1, 20:1 and 80:1 SDM + OMP ratios, respectively.  Only
56, 61 and 70% of the 194 SDM resistant strains were resistant to the SDM + OMP
5:1, 20:1 and 80:1 ratios. Resistance percentages included 47 pseudomonas and 3
alcaligenes strains known to be resistant to the SDM + OMP potentiated
sulfonamide.<P>
An overall 18, 20 and 24% incidence of resistance to the 5:1, 20:1 and 80:1 SDM
+ OMP ratios was observed for the 754 strains, against a 39% incidence of
resistance to SDM.<P>
Evaluation of the data obtained in this study indicate that the percentages of
gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains resistant to the SDM + OMP
5:1, 20:1 and 80:1 ratios were considerably lower than the corresponding SDM
percentages.<P>

2.<I>In Vivo</I> Study (Dogs)<P>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Primor
(sulfadimethoxine + ormetoprim 5:1) in an experimentally induced soft tissue
infection in dogs and to compare it to that of sulfadimethoxine and of
ormetoprim used singly.<P>
Twenty purebred beagles (equal number of male and female), ranging in age from
11 to 18 months and in weight from 7.2 to 13.4 kg, were infected subcutaneously
at four ventral sites with a strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i> resistant to
penicillin, erythromycin, streptomycin, and sulfonamides.  Treatment groups
consisted of: 1) Primor at 55 mg/kg (25 mg/lb) b.w. on day one, followed by 7
consecutive daily doses of 27.5 mg/kg (12.5 mg/lb) (4M &amp; 4F); 2) sulfadimethoxine 
at 55 mg/kg (25 mg/lb) on day one, followed by 7
consecutive daily doses of 27.5 mg/kg (12.5 mg/lb) (4M &amp; 4F); 3) ormetoprim
at 9.2 mg/kg (4.2 mg/lb) on day one, followed by 7 consecutive daily doses of
4.6 mg/kg (2.1 mg/lb) (2M &amp; 2F); and 4) placebo (2M &amp; 2F).  The drugs
were administered orally, as suspensions.<p>
Clinical and microbiological criteria employed to evaluate the efficacy of the
treatments included body temperature, daily lesion scores (size and severity of
the lesions), and microbiological re-isolation of the causative organisms.
Following is a summary table of the four treatment regimens.  (Table 3).<P>

<P>
The distinct effect/no effect results obtained in this study show, without the
need for statistical analysis, that Primor, sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim in
a ratio of 5:1, is the therapeutically more effective than either
sulfadimethoxine or ormetoprim administered singly (Dr. G. Maestrone,
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc).<P>

ormetoprim, was compared with a negative placebo and an approved, positive
control drug (Di Trim) in an acute urinary tract infection model in dogs
produced with <i>Escherichia coli</i>.  Dosing regimens of one half, one and
two times the recommended use level were compared to non-medicated controls and
positive control medicated with a commercially available potentiated
sulfonamide.  The dosing schedule and results are shown in Table 4.  The
specific clinical and laboratory criteria used in the model clearly define the
diagnostic and therapeutic end points (G.V. Ling, et al., <I>Am. J. Vet. Res.</I> 40,
1605-1612 (1979) and 41, 686-690 (1980).  This was a blinded study.  Treatments
were allocated and administered by a person not responsible for clinical
observations and with no knowledge of laboratory results.<P>
Dogs were treated for ten consecutive days following confirmation of urinary
tract infection.  Laboratory data, including a complete blood count, SMA12
chemistry panel, urinalysis, and urine culture, were obtained on each dog at
the end of a conditioning period, 48 hours or more after inoculation (prior to
first treatment), on the fifth and tenth days of treatment, and seven days
after the end of treatment.  The primary laboratory criterion for the
evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of the treatment drug doses was bacterial
culture counts from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis.  The
presence of any bacteria in the urine was considered indicative of an active
infection.<P>
The comparative efficacy of the treatments given was based on the number of
bacteriologic cures, the number of bacteriologic failures, and the number of
bacteriologic relapses in each treatment group in comparison to untreated
controls and the other treatment groups.<P>
Variations in blood counts and blood chemistries were observed in some dogs;
however, most dogs remained within normal limits throughout the experiment.
Animals were monitored daily for clinical manifestations of infection and for
possible side effects. No side effects related to treatment were observed.<P>

Although effect/no effect results do not lend themselves to statistical
analysis, the results of this study show that all treatments are similar, and
that they are superior to placebo. (Dr. G.V. Ling, College of Veterinary
Medicine, University of California).<P>
B. Therapeutic Blood Levels:<P>
<I>In vitro</I> studies have demonstrated that the ratio of
ormetoprim : sulfadimethoxine must not exceed 1:1200.  <I>In vivo</I> blood studies have
demonstrated that at one half the recommended use level, Primor does not
consistently maintain therapeutic blood levels in dogs over a 24 hour period as
does the recommended use level.  Sulfadimethoxine / ormetoprim blood levels
achieved with an initial (loading) dose of 25 mg/lb (55 mg/kg) on day one and
maintained by 12.5 mg/lb (27.5 mg/kg) body weight on day two were studied in two
male and two female dogs.  These were compared to levels attained in eight dogs
administered one half the recommended dosing regimen (i.e., given 12.5 mg/lb
day one, 6.25 mg/lb 24 hours later).  A series of blood samples were taken at
various times after dosing, six of which are reported in Table 5.  The initial
dose was administered at zero hours.  The maintenance dose was administered
immediately after the 24 hour sampling.  The data show that at one half the
recommended dose level, ormetoprim (essential for Primor's potentiated
property) is not detectable 24 hours after administration, thereby precluding a
one a day medication schedule. The data do demonstrate that therapeutically
effective blood levels of both sulfadimethoxine/ormetoprim are obtained and
maintained over a 24 hour period with the recommended Primor dosing regimen.<P>

<P>
Since sulfonamides are bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal, adequate blood
levels must be maintained for a sufficient period of time to effect a cure.
Therefore, based on the clinical and blood level data, it is concluded that the
recommended once a day dosing regimen for Primor is effective (orally 12.5
mg/lb (27.5 mg/kg) body weight, with a double dose on day one).  (Drs. J.
Fellig and G. Maestrone, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.).<P>
4. Blinded Clinical Dog Study:<P>
The therapeutic efficacy of Primor tablets administered orally in the treatment
of skin and soft tissue bacterial infections in dogs was evaluated in a double
blind study conducted in three major geographical areas of the U.S. using the
5:1 ratio of sulfadiazine and trimethoprim as the positive control.  Bacterial
cultures were taken prior to and following treatment and antibacterial
sensitivities were determined.  Qualifying <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i>
cases are presented in Table 6.  Twenty-six cases were treated with Primor and
25 with the control drug.  The majority of the responding cases involved
various infected skin wounds and abscesses.  The cooperating veterinarians are
listed in Table 7.<P>
Primor tablets were administered at the recommended dose of 55 mg/kg b.w. (25
mg/lb) on day one, and at 27.5 mg/kg (12.5 mg/lb) per day for the remainder of
the treatment period; the control drug was administered at the recommended dose
level of 14 mg/lb/day throughout the treatment period.  Duration of treatment
ranged from 5 to 11 days for both drugs.<P>
Although studies of this design are not amenable to statistical analysis, the
results obtained, reported in the following table, that Primor is effective in
the treatment of bacterial skin and soft tissue infections in dogs and is at
least as effective as the positive control.<P>

B. Corroborative Studies:<P>
1. <I>In vivo</I> Mouse Studies:<P>
The potentiation effect of ormetoprim on sulfadimethoxine was demonstrated in
mice with experimentally produced systemic infections caused by <i>Diplococcus
pneumoniae</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>,
<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Salmonella
schottmuelleri</i>, <i>Salmonella typhosa</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</i>.  The mice (6-8 per organism) were treated orally with graded
doses of sulfadimethoxine, with and without concomitant administration of
ormetoprim at a level (50 mg/kg b.w.) which had been shown to be inactive by
itself.  Six treatments, in one ml doses, were administered orally to each
mouse on the following schedule: two treatments, five hours apart, on the day
of and day following infection; one treatment on the second and third days
following infection; with first treatment immediately after infection.  The
health status of each animal was reported for three days following infection
and dead animals reported for 14 days following infection.<P>
A 50% curative dose (CD 50) was calculated on the basis of the survival of the
treated animals.  Potentiation was considered to have occurred if the CD50
value for the sulfadimethoxine alone was consistently at least twice the CD50
value obtained with the sulfadimethoxine/ormetoprim.  Potentiation of
sulfadimethoxine, indicated by a decrease in the CD50 values in the presence of
ormetoprim, was observed to be two to five fold with all organisms except
<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.  (Dr. R. Cleeland, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.).<P>
2. Susceptibility to Primor of 671 Bacterial Strains of Canine Origin<br>

3. Clinical Dog Studies<P>
The therapeutic efficacy of Primor tablets administered at the dose level of 55
mg/kg (25 mg/lb b.w.) on day one, followed by consecutive daily doses of 27.5
mg/kg (12.5 mg/lb b.w.) was confirmed in the treatment of 217 clinical cases in
dogs caused by bacterial agents.<P>
This study was conducted at 13 veterinary facilities representing various
geographical areas of the U.S.  A list of these facilities is given in Table 9.
Dogs of different breed, weight, sex and age were used in this evaluation and,
whenever feasible, bacterial agents were isolated, identified and their
susceptibility to antibacterial agents established before and after treatment.
Evaluation of the treatment was based on change in clinical symptoms and in
laboratory findings.  Infections of the respiratory, digestive and urogenital
tracts and of soft tissues were treated using Primor as the only
chemotherapeutic agent with the following results:<P>

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level at which orally
administered (in gelatin capsule) sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and ormetoprim (OMP)
individually, and jointly in a 5:3 ratio produced toxicity symptoms.  This was
accomplished by doubling (i.e., pyramiding) the initial dose of 5 mg drug
activity/kg (2.3 mg/lb) body weight on successive days, excluding weekends.
The individual components were each tested in single but different dogs and the
SDM/OMP (5:3 ratio) was tested in two dogs, in accordance with the following

The
5:3 dosing regimen provided a more severe ormetoprim challenge than will be
experienced with the 5:1 ratio provided by Primor. Blood sugar and cholesterol
determinations were made before initial dosing and one hour following each
dose.  Blood counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit were performed before treatment
and after final dosing.  Observations of symptoms and appetite were also made
(Dr. R. Banziger, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.).<P>
Results of this study were as follows:<P>
Sulfadimethoxine only: A single dog receiving pyramiding daily doses of up to
320 mg/kg (145 mg/lb) tolerated the drug without side effects.  There were no
significant effects of blood sugar, serum cholesterol or other blood values.<P>
Ormetoprim only: A single dog receiving pyramiding daily doses of up to 160
mg/kg (73 mg/lb) became convulsive and drug administration was stopped.  The
dog survived the five day observation period.  There were no significant
changes in serum cholesterol or blood values.  Blood sugar was elevated on the
sixth dose day.<br>
Sulfadimethoxine/Ormetoprim: The two dogs receiving pyramiding daily doses of
up to 320 mg active drug/kg b.w. (145 mg/lb) survived.  There were no
significant changes noted in blood sugar, serum cholesterol or other blood
values.<P>
One dog (6.35 kg) showed signs of depression at doses of 160 and 320 mg/kg (73
and 145 mg/lb) of body weight and slight tremors after the 320 mg/kg dose.
Throughout the observation period all food was consumed and the dog appeared
normal at the end of the five day observation period post drug.<P>
A second dog (10.45 kg) showed slight tremors at 40 to 80 mg/kg (18 to 36
mg/lb) body weight, increased motor activity and tremors at 160 mg/kg (73
mg/lb), but ate all food up to the 160 mg/kg (73 mg/lb) dose.  At 320 mg/kg
(145 mg/lb) there were convulsions later in the day and the dog did not eat.
During the five day post drug observation period the dog ate all food presented
and appeared to be normal.<P>
The 320 mg/kg dose is approximately five times the proposed initial dose for
Primor and ten times the maintenance dose.  No sustaining long term effects
were observed following the pyramiding doses. The conclusion is that Primor is
safe to use in dogs at the proposed dosage of 55 mg/kg initially followed by a
27.5 mg/kg maintenance dose.<P>
2. Subacute Toxicity Dogs:<P>
An eight week oral toxicity study was conducted in forty two beagle dogs with
Primor (sulfadimethoxine + ormetoprim, 5:1).  The compounds were administered
together in the market dosage form designed for clinical veterinary use.
Dosages were 0 (control), 0 (excipient), 27.5, 82.5, or 137.5 mg/kg (12.5,
37.5, or 62.5 mg/lb)b.w./day.  The drug levels used represent at least 1x, 3x
and 5x the label dose level, administered for approximately three times the
maximum 21 day duration provided by label direction.  This length of
administration was approximately eight times the five to seven day use period
anticipated in clinical situations.<P>
The high dose and the control group contained six dogs/sex/group and the mid
dose, low dose and excipient groups contained three dogs/sex/group.  Following
the eight week treatment period, three dogs/sex/group were necropsied and the
remaining high dose and control group dogs (3/sex/group) were observed for a 12
week recovery period prior to necropsy.<P>
Treatment of dogs with Primor at 137.5 mg/kg (62.5 mg/lb) b.w./day for eight
weeks resulted in a low incidence of mild clinical signs; minimal corneal and
lens opacities; reduced heart rate and R wave amplitude; decreased hemoglobin
and hematocrit; decreased serum T3, T4, and folate; elevated serum cholesterol;
increased thyroid, pituitary, liver and prostate weights; parenchymatous
thyroid hyperplasia; enlarged basophilic cells in the pituitary; involution of
the thymic cortex, slight histologic changes in the adrenal cortex; areas of
vacuolization and rarefication of hepatocytes limited, focal testicular
atrophy.  At the end of a 12 week recovery period, the enlarged thyroids had
markedly decreased in average weight but were still heavier than the control
thyroids, diffuse colloidal goiter was present indicating recovery of function,
and treatment related lens opacities were still present in one of two dogs that
exhibited this change at the end of the treatment period.  All other changes
were totally reversible.<P>
Treatment of dogs with Primor at 82.5 mg/kg (37.5 mg/lb)b.w./day for eight
weeks resulted in minimal, transient corneal opacities; decreased heart rate
and R wave amplitude; decreased hematocrit; decreased T3,T4 and folate values;
increased serum cholesterol values; increased thyroid, pituitary, liver, and
prostate weights; parenchymatous thyroid hyperplasia; enlarged basophilic cells
in the pituitary and slight histologic changes in the adrenal cortex. The
incidence and severity of these changes were reduced when compared to the high
dose group.<P>
Treatment of dogs with Primor at 27.5 mg.kg (12.5 mg.lb)b.w./day for eight
weeks resulted in elevated serum cholesterol, increased thyroid and liver
weights, enlarged basophilic cells in the pituitary and mild follicular thyroid
hyperplasia.<P>
Based on reversal of virtually all treatment related effects observed with the
high dose dogs, it is concluded that the principal treatment related effects of
extended or excessive Primor usage is hypothyroidism.  Such effects are known
effects of sulfonamides per se and are not considered unique to Primor (Dr.
T.J. Hayes, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.).<P>
3. Chronic Toxicity Dogs:<P>
A 13 week toxicity study was conducted in dogs which
sulfadimethoxine/ormetoprim (SDM/OMP) was orally administered in gelatin
capsules at 0/0, 0/60, 25/15, 50/30 or 100/60 mg/kg (0/0, 0/27.3, 11.4/6.8,
22.7/13.6 or 45/27.3 mg/lb)b.w./dog to evaluate the effect of prolonged
administration of Primor (5:1 SMD/OMP), and the potentiator ormetoprim, per se.
The 5:3 dosing regimen used in this study provided a more severe ormetoprim
challenge than would be experienced by dogs medicated with the 5:1 dosing
regimen provided by Primor.  The total active drug level used in this study was
approximately 1.5x, 3x and 6x the recommended Primor use level. For each
component (i.e., SDM/OMP), the study levels were approximately 0/11x, 1/3x,
2/5x and 4/11x their recommended use levels.  Four dogs (two male, two female)
were assigned to each treatment group.<P>
Ormetoprim at 60 mg/kg alone or in combination with 1000 mg sulfadimethoxine
produced toxic reactions characterized by gastrointestinal disturbances and
weight loss, brief seizures, hyperactivity and muscle tremors and salivation.
Effects on hemopoiesis per se were not observed but elevations in hematocrit
and hemoglobin, indicative of dehydration, were observed.<P>
Three of the dogs on the high level of SDM/OMP and one on OMP per se were taken
off medication during the fifth week.  One SDM/OMP dog died during the sixth
week, the other two and the OMP treatment dog, aided by 5% glucose
administration, appeared normal in four to five weeks.  Subsequently, they were
placed back on medication during the ninth week at 75 mg SDM/45 mg OMP and 45
mg OMP/kg, respectively, without any adverse effects.  Medication of another
OMP treatment dog was discontinued during the eleventh week.<P>
Results of this study indicate that concurrent medication with ormetoprim does
not increase the toxicity of sulfadimethoxine. Also, inadvertent short term
overdosing with Primor, or prolonged administration of label dose, will not
have any significant adverse effects on dogs (Dr. R.E. Bagdon, Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc.).<P>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><br>

A. Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption<P>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  This product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only in dogs, which are not non-food animals.<P>
B. Human Safety Considerations Other Than Food Safety<P>
In regard to possession, handling, and administration, labeling contains the
statements: "Not For Use in Humans - For Use In Dogs Only" and "Keep Out Of
Reach Of Children."<P>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><br>

Data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and Section 512.11 of the implementing regulations.  The data
demonstrated that Primor tablets, when used under approved conditions of use,
are safe and effective.<P>
The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian
because a veterinarian is needed for the diagnosis of the underlying causes of
bacterial infection for which the drug is indicated.  Skin infections are often
secondary to other underlying clinical conditions; allergic, dietary, hormonal,
immunologic and metabolic.  For the antibacterial to be effective, it should be
used in conjunction with the treatment for the primary underlying clinical
condition(s).  Diagnosis of the primary underlying condition(s) requires the
expertise of medically trained individuals with the aid of diagnostic
facilities available to them.  Therefore, the label for Primor tablets must
bear the prescription legend.<P>

<B>Date of Summary:</B> April 6, 1994<P>

<B>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</B><P>

In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (<B>55 FR 3107</B>),
following the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article
(ANADA 200-075; generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri- Vet
Company is entitled to the approval of generic salinomycin in combination
with roxarsone. Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of
this generic combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is
codified under <B>21 CFR paragraph 558.550.</B> Roxarsone (3-Nitro) is codified
under <B>21 CFR paragraph 558.530.</B> The combination of salinomycin sodium and
roxarsone is codified under <B>21 CFR paragraph 558.550(a) and (b)(1)(v)</B>.<P>

<B>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><P>

In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed).<P>

<B>a. Tolerances/Safe Concentrations for Residues</B><P>

The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium
product applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe
concentrations for total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible
tissues of broiler chickens were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm
in liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat.<P>

Tolerances of arsenic (from roxarsone) are established at 0.5 ppm in muscle
and 2 ppm in edible by-product (<B>21 CFR paragraph 556.60</B>) with liver as the
target tissue.<P>

<B>b. Withdrawal Time</B><P>

As specified in <B>21 CFR paragraph 558.550(b)(1)(v)</B>, a 5-day withdrawal time
is required for the combination of lincomycin, roxarsone and salinomycin.<P>

<B>c. Regulatory Method for Residues</B><P>

A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels
in all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were
significantly below the established safe concentration for total residues.<P>

A spectrophotometric method is used to assay tissues for roxarsone
residues. The method is entitled "Arsenic (Total Residues in Animal
Tissues, Spectrophotometric Method" published in AOAC, 14th Edition 41.009,
page 777.<P>

<B>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><P>

This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of salinomycin sodium and roxarsone, when
used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its
labeled indications.<P>

<B>Labeling:</B><P>

Facsimile generic labeling and currently approved pioneer labeling are
attached, as shown:<P>

--- Blue Bird label for the generic Type C medicated feed for broiler
chickens<br>

--- Blue Bird label for the pioneer Type C medicated feed for broiler
chickens.<P>

<b>I.  General Information:</b><p>

<b>NADA Numbers:</b><p> 138-792<br>
                138-870<p> 
<b>Sponsor:</b><p>      The Upjohn Company<br>
            Agricultural Division<p> 
<b>Sponsor Number:</b>  000009<p> 
<b>Generic Name:</b>    melengestrol acetate<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>   MGA&#174; 100/200 Premix, 
            MGA&#174; 500 Liquid Premix<p> 
<b>Generic Name:</b>    monensin sodium<br>
<b>Trade Name:  </b>Rumensin&#174;<p> 
<b>Generic Name:    </b>tylosin phosphate<br>
<b>Trade Name:</b>  Tylan&#174;<p> 
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC<p> 
<b>Date of Summary:</b> August 6, 1990<p> 
<b>II.  Indications for Use:</b><p> 
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter.<p> 
<b>III.  Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><p> 
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Feed<p> 
<b>Route of Administration:  </b>Oral<p> 
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><ul><p>
    <li>melengestrol acetate - 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
    <li>monensin sodium - 5 to 30 g/ton of air dried complete feed<br>
    <li>tylosin phosphate - 8 to 10 g/ton of air dried complete feed (to provide 90
mg/hd/day)</ul><p> 
    Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate (MGA)
per head per day in combination     with 5 to 30 g monensin per ton of air dried
complete feed and 8 to 10 g tylosin per ton of air dried complete   feed (to
provide 90 mg/hd/day) when each additive is provided via separate supplements
or a supplement     containing MGA is fed in combination with a
complete feed containing monensin and tylosin.<p> 
    The supplement containing melengestrol acetate provided at a rate of 0.5 to
2.0 pounds per head may be top-dressed onto or mixed with the feed containing
monensin and tylosin.<p> 
    This clearance does not provide for the mixing of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin premixes together     in a common supplement or in a
complete ration offered for sale by the feed manufacturer.<p> 

<b>IV.  Effectiveness:  (In compliance with combination approval claims)</b><p> 
The efficacy of melengestrol acetate for increased rate of weight gain,
improved feed efficiency and suppression of estrus (heat) in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter is well documented and approved  (21 CFR 558.342).
Further, the effectiveness of monensin for improved feed efficiency and
increased rate of weight gain of feedlot  cattle is established and approved
(21 CFR 558.311) as is the effectiveness of tylosin for reduction of liver
abscesses in the same class of cattle (21 CFR 558.625).  For these applications,
the efficacy of melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin when
co-administered was established by conducting a series of field trials under a
common protocol.  These trials were designed to evaluate the performance of
feedlot heifers fed each drug separately and in combination.<p> 

<b>A.  Pivotal Study</b><p> 
A feedlot heifer study consisting of field trials at nine locations with three
replications per location was conducted to generate animal performance data on
the combination of melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin.  Results of
each study are reported as well as a summary and statistical analysis of the
pooled data from all nine field investigations.<p>

<b>3.  General design of each field investigation</b><p>
    <b>a.  Purpose of the field investigation:</b><p>  To evaluate the effect of
melengestrol acetate, monensin sodium and          tylosin phosphate on the
performance of feedlot heifers when fed singly and in combination.<p> 
   <b> b.  Test animals</b><ul><p>
        <li>(1)  Species:  Bovine<br>
        Number/group:  The number of heifers per treatment group varied from location
to location, and ranged from        6 to 14 animals per pen (Table 1).<p> 
        <li>(2)  Subgroup Identity:  Heifers used in the field studies were non-pregnant
yearlings and the breeds were       typical of those commonly found in commercial
feedlots.  The average initial weights ranged from 674 to       826 pounds (Table
1).</ul><p> 
    <b>c.  Control groups</b><p>
        Groups of heifers fed melengestrol acetate, or monensin or tylosin alone, or
monensin and tylosin in            combination served as controls.  Pairwise,
comparisons were made to groups of heifers for the 3 drugs in
combination.<p>
    <b>d.  Diagnosis:</b>  Not applicable.<p> 
   <b> e.  Dosage form:</b><p>
        (1)  Medicated feed:  Feed was medicated using melengestrol acetate,
monensin or tylosin premixes.  Final       feeds were prepared using intermediate
premixes which were either mixed into or top-dressed onto the bulk of       the
ration.<p> 
    <b>f.  Route of drug administration:  </b> 
        (1)  Oral<p> 
   <b> g.  Dosages: </b><p> The dosages used in the field study were: melengestrol acetate,
0.5 mg/head/day; monensin, 30      gm/ton of air dried feed; tylosin, 10 gm/ton
of air dried feed.<p> 
   <b> h.  Days on test: </b><p> The cattle were fed for a minimum of 90 days, the actual
day of trial termination being left up      to the investigator's judgement as to
when the cattle had reached market weight and condition.  The days on       test by
location are listed on Table 1.<p>

    The combination of melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin was justified.
In the melengestrol acetate &#43;    tylosin vs. melengestrol acetate &#43;  monensin &#43; 
tylosin contrast, the contribution of monensin for increased feed   efficiency
(P &#61;  0.00015) was demonstrated.  In the tylosin vs. melengestrol acetate,
tylosin, and monensin   contrast, the estrus suppression effect of melengestrol
acetate was demonstrated (P &#61;  0.0000003) as was the     average daily gain
contribution of melengestrol acetate and monensin (P &#61;  0.00010).  The
contribution of     tylosin for control of liver abscesses (P &#61;  0.00752) was
evident in the melengestrol acetate vs. melengestrol    acetate, monensin and
tylosin contrast (Table 7).<p>
<b>6.  Conclusions</b><p>
    The data generated by the nine location field study demonstrated that the
melengestrol acetate, monensin, tylosin     combination is justified for it's
effect on estrus suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased average daily
gain and reduction of liver abscesses.<p>
 <b>7.  Adverse Reactions</b><p>
    No adverse reactions due to the feeding of melengestrol acetate, monensin, or
tylosin, either singly or in    combination were reported.<p>
<b>8.  Special Issues</b><p>
    Compliance with combination drug policy:<ul><p>
       <li> a.  The effectiveness and safety of melengestrol acetate, monensin, and
tylosin when fed singly to      feedlot cattle are well documented in their
respective approved NADAs.  The results of adequately           controlled studies
were submitted to the FDA in support of these respective NADAs.  Such data
resulted in the approval of melengestrol acetate as per CFR 558.342, monensin
as per CFR 558.355 and  tylosin as per CFR 558.625.  Data
generated in support of         combination usage have demonstrated that melengestrol
acetate, monensin and tylosin fed together are      effective and safe.<p>
        The data support compliance with 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v) and CVM's combination
drug guidelines         (November 9, 1983).  The combination is justified as detailed
in sections 4, 5 and 6 of this application.<p>
        The use of untreated controls was not deemed necessary as a test for general
effectiveness because the       individual drugs have been previously shown to be
effective and already approved at the levels tested.        The treatment groups
consisting of the individual drugs and the two-way combinations served as the
appropriate controls for the respective two-way combination.  Thus, these
treatment groups essentially        served as negative controls with respect to
21 CFR 514.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(4), an the studies were properly         controlled.<p>
        To justify the combination, comparisons were made which demonstrated that
each drug made a            statistically significant contribution to the combination.
The three-way combination provides a benefit        that cannot be obtained from any
of the possible two-way combinations.<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate vs melengestrol
acetate-monensin-tylosin for transformed percent        liver abscesses demonstrates
the contribution of tylosin to the combination.  This comparison is based       on
the the fact that neither melengestrol acetate nor monensin has an effect on
liver abscesses.  Data in       the monensin-tylosin NADA (104-646) verify the
assumption that monensin has no effect on liver         abscesses and data in NADA
(138-995) verify that melengestrol acetate has no effect on liver abscesses.<p>
        A comparison of tylosin vs melengestrol acetate-monensin-tylosin addresses
melengestrol acetate's      contribution to the combination. Since melengestrol
acetate has estrus suppression activity and             monensin does not, this
comparison is a valid measure of the effect of melengestrol acetate in the
combination.  This assumption is verified by data in NADA 124-309 (melengestrol
acetate-monensin).<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-tylosin vs melengestrol
acetate-monensin-tylosin addresses          monensin's contributions that
significantly improved feed efficiency is available with the three-way
combination when compared to the two-way, melengestrol acetate-tylosin.<p>
        The proposed ranges for each drug are justified when fed in combination
since the highest levels            proposed were tested in combination for efficiency
and human and animal safety.</ul><p>

The safety of melengestrol acetate, monensin, and tylosin in the bovine have

    *Bone marrow smears were made at the time of necropsy, air dried and fixed for
30 seconds or more in methanol.     Slides were stained with Wrights stain.<p> 
    The following organs were weighed at necropsy, paired organs weighed
together:<p>
    Adrenals, liver, kidneys and heart.</ul><p> 
<b>4)  Results</b><ul><p>
    <li>a.  Clinical Observations<p>
        No adverse, drug-related clinical signs were observed during this study.
Although there were no significant     
         differences in average daily gain (ADG) between treated and control animals
at mid-study and at termination,        there was a trend toward decreased ADG at
the 3X and 5X levels of treatment.<p> 
    <li>b.  Clinical pathology<p>
        Occasional statistically significant changes in several hematologic and serum
chemistry parameters were       detected, but all values were well within normal
acceptable ranges and no dose-related trends were seen.<p> 
    <li>c.  Gross and microscopic pathology<p>
        Several gross and histologic tissue changes were observed, but due to the
relative even distribution of the       changes in all dose groups including
controls, these findings were considered to be incidental rather than drug-related.</ul><p> 
<b>4.  Conclusions</b><p>
    a.  Based upon the results of this study, the combination of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin phosphate in  the daily feed of yearling heifers appears
to be non-toxic when fed for 90 days at up to 5 times the recommended   dose.<p>

<b>VI.  Human Safety:</b><p> 
<b>A.  Drugs for use in food animals</b><p> 
<b>1.  Toxicity tests</b><p>
    Data regarding toxicity testing in melengestrol acetate, monensin sodium and
tylosin phosphate are contained in  the approved NADAs for the three above
mentioned compounds.<p> 

<b>2.  Safe concentration of residues</b><p>
Tolerances for melengestrol acetate, monensin sodium and tylosin phosphate
are published in the <i>Code of Federal     Regulations</i>.&#160; Melengestrol acetate
is currently approved under 21 CFR 558.342 for use in heifers at 0.25 to 0.50
mg/head/day with a 48-hour withdrawal period.  No residues of melengestrol
acetate may be found in uncooked    edible tissues of cattle with a method
sensitive to 25 ppb (21 CFR 556.380).  The tolerance for monensin in    edible
tissue of cattle under 21 CFR 556.347 is 0.7 ppm with no withdrawal period
established for cattle under    21 CFR 558.311.  The tolerance for tylosin
phosphate has been established at 0.2 ppm (negligible residue) in   uncooked
fat, muscle, liver and kidney (CFR 556.740).  Tylosin phosphate has no
withdrawal period established   under 21 CFR 558.625.<p> 

<b>3.  Metabolism and total residue depletion studies</b><p>
Numerous studies have been conducted relative to the metabolism and depletion
of residues of melengestrol     acetate, monensin, and tylosin when administered
individually to cattle.  The results of those studies have been     filed under
the following submissions:<p>

</pre>

    The animals in each group were slaughtered within 16 hours following their
last feeding.  Perirenal fat was    collected from all four treatment groups for
the melengestrol acetate analysis, and liver samples were collected     from the
group 1 and 2 animals for the assay of monensin and tylosin.<p> 
    <b>a.  Residues of melengestrol acetate</b><p>
        The samples of pererenal fat from each animal were assayed for residues of
melengestrol acetate using the      official AOAC gas chromatographic method.
Analysis of the samples from the group 2 (1X) animals           showed that all fat
samples were below the 25 ppb tolerance for MGA and five of the seven samples
were        below the 10 ppb limit of reliable measurement of the assay.  The two
fat samples that gave positive          responses had MGA levels of 12.7 and 13.7
ppb.<p> 
        Fat samples from groups 3 and 4 (the heifers dosed at 3X and 5X levels)
yielded average residue levels of       37.6 and 49.4 ppm, respectively.<p> 
   <b> b.  Residues of monensin</b><p>
        Liver tissue that was collected from the seven control animals and the seven
heifers fed the group 2 (1X)        ration were assayed for monensin by a method
that measures microbiologically active residues of the drug.        No positive
responses in any of the samples were obtained by this method which has a limit
of quantitation         of 0.04 ppm.<p>
     <b>c.  Residues of tylosin </b><p>
        The liver tissue samples from the group 2 (1X) heifers and seven of the
control animals were assayed for         tylosin by the official assay which measures
microbiologically active residues of the drug.  No positive responses were      obtained for
any of the samples by this method which has a limit of quantitation of 0.1
ppm.<p>
  <b>5.  Assay noninterference data</b><p>
    <b>a.  Melengestrol acetate assay</b><p>
        Data were generated using spiked control fat tissue samples to demonstrate
that the presence of tylosin and        monensin does not interfere with the assay
of MGA.  The study was also intended to show that MGA is        stable in frozen fat
tissue over a period of 60 days. <p>
        Samples of freshly ground control bovine fat tissue were spiked with MGA,
tylosin and monensin at the         following levels:<p>
        MGA:  0.025<br>
        monensin sodium:  5.0 ppm<br>
        Tylosin phosphate:  1.0 ppm<p> 
The spiked samples were assayed in duplicate for MGA by the official AOAC
method after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days of storage at -20&#176;C.  The average
recoveries are shown below.<p>

   <b> b.  Monensin assay</b><p>
        The data to demonstrate that the presence of tylosin and MGA does not
interfere with the assay of monensin        in cattle liver are contained in study
S-AAC-84-02 conducted by Elanco Products Company.  In that study,       samples of
liver tissue from control heifers were composited and fortified with 0.06 ppm
monensin, 0.2 ppm       tylosin and 0.2 ppm MGA.  The analysis of those samples by
the thin-layer bioautographic method for        monensin showed no interference by
tylosin and MGA.<p>
        The stability of monensin in frozen liver tissue was demonstrated through
the use of fortified control            samples.  Liver tissue from control animals was
spiked with monensin at 0.06 ppm, frozen for 26 days, and  
         then assayed for monensin.  Recoveries averaged 104% of the theoretical
spike.<p>
   <b> c.  Tylosin assay</b><p>
        Data to demonstrate that the presence of MGA and monensin does not interfere with
the assay of tylosin were       generated by Elanco Products Company in study
S-AAC-84-02.  Samples of liver from control heifers were        composited and
fortified with 0.2 ppm MGA, 0.2 ppm monensin, and 0.2 ppm tylosin.  The samples
were        assayed for tylosin by the cylinder plate microbiological method using
<i>Micrococcus luteus</i>&#160; as the test           organism.  No interference was
detected by the presence of monensin and MGA.<p>
        The stability of tylosin in frozen liver tissues was demonstrated in study
MRC8910 conducted by the Elanco         Products Company.  Liver tissue from control
animals was fortified with 0.2 ppm tylosin and then frozen.         Portions of the
samples were thawed at intervals up to 56 days and assayed for tylosin.  The
stability of        tylosin through 56 days was indicated by the recoveries in the
following table:<p>

</pre>
 
        Regression analysis of these data demonstrates satisfactory tylosin stability
for the period the tissues in the       residue depletion study were stored before
assay.<p> 
        The residue depletion and assay noninterference studies presented above
demonstrate that the combined feeding       of melengestrol  acetate, monensin
sodium, and tylosin phosphate at their highest approved levels results in
tissue residues below the tolerance levels for each of the three drugs at 16
hours of withdrawal.  The data also         show that each drug in the three-way
combination does not interfere with the assays for the others.  This        work
confirms the adequacy of the 48 hour withdrawal time required for the presence
of MGA in the           combination and demonstrates that the use of these feed
additives in combination does not pose a hazard to      public health.<p> 

<b>6. Regulatory methods</b><p>
    Practical analytical methods of analysis for tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, monensin sodium and tylosin   phosphate may be found in the <i>Food
Additives Analytical Manual</i>&#160; on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (Room 12-A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.<p>

<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p> 
 
These NADAs provide for the combination use of MGA, monensin sodium, and
tylosin phosphate at the levels of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day, 5 to 30 g/ton of
feed, and 8 to 10 g/ton of feed (to supply 90 mg/head/day), respectively; for
increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of estrus
(heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter.  Adequate data were submitted which show that the MGA, monensin,
tylosin combination is justified for its effects on estrus suppression,
improved feed efficiency, increased rate of weight gain, and reduction of liver
abscesses.  Each drug; MGA, monensin, and tylosin has been shown to make a
significant (P &#60; .05) contribution to the effectiveness of the combination.  The
combination, when fed at up to 5X the highest recommended combination approval
(0.5 mg MGA/head/day plus 30 g monensin/ton, and 10 g tylosin phosphate/ton for
90 days), did not produce an adverse effect.  No changes were made in the
approved levels of the compounds or in the target animal and the
non-interference of tylosin phosphate, monensin sodium, and MGA with the
analytical methods for MGA, monensin and tylosin phosphate, respectively, was
demonstrated.  Accordingly, approval of theses NADAs is not expected to
increase human exposure to drug residues, and therefore did not require a
complete re-evaluation of the human safety data in the original applications.
For the purposes of human food safety review, these original NADAs have been
treated as Category II supplements under the Agency's Supplemental Policy (42
FR 64367).  These production drugs are OTC because they do not raise any
special safety concerns.<p>

<li><b>3.  General design of the investigation </b><ul><p>
<li><b>a.  Purpose of study.</b><p>  The purpose of the study was to test the safety and
effectiveness of yohimbine as a reversing agent and antidote for xylazine in
dogs. <p>
<li><b>b.  Test animals:</b>  &gt; or &#61;180 dogs of random age, sex, weight, and breed. <p>
<li><b>c.  Type of controls used.</b> <p>
 
Two types of controls were used:  (1) each animal was tested for  
behavioral/pharmacologic effects before and after injection of the Yobine(TM); and
(2)  half of the test animals were administered a placebo instead of the test
drug. <p>
<li><b>d.  Diagnosis:</b><p>  Testing was done on animals which were given xylazine for
procedures indicated for its use. <p>
<li><b>e.  Dosage form:</b><p>  sterile aqueous solution.  The product tested was identical
to the product to be marketed. <p>
<li><b>f.  Route of administration:</b>  I.V. <p>
<li><b>g.  Dosage used:</b><p>  Dose in study was 0.5 mL yohimbine per 20 pound body weight
(0.05 mg/lb or 0.11 mg/kg). <p>
<li><b>h.  Test duration:</b> <p> Testing at sites started after October 10, 1986 and was
terminated on June 1, 1987.  Each animal was observed for &gt; or &#61;35 minutes. <p>
<li><b>i.  Pertinent parameters measured:</b><ol> <p>
<li>Sedation times (Recumbency, Arousal, Walk) <br>
<li>Analgesia (Prick response) <br>
<li>Clinical Signs, Heart Rate, Respiration Rate </ol></ul><p>
<li><b>4).  Results </b><p>
Veterinarians conducting the clinical trials were instructed to  
administer xylazine (Rompun&#174;, Bay Vet), using a random table, by one of the
following routes and doses in mg/lb:  (1) I.V. = 0.5; (2) I.M. = 1.0 for dogs
&lt; 50 lb, 0.5 for dogs &gt; or &#61; 50 lb; S.C. &#61; 1.0.<p> Seventy one out of 258 cases
were not usable, mainly due to the fact that animals frequently did not become
adequately sedated in dogs given the xylazine I.M. at 0.5 mg/lb, and to other
aberrations, such as drugs being combined in the tests.  Therefore, 187 cases
were used in the trials.  The following observations were recorded <p>

<li><b>4). Results </b><p>
Using Dunnett test for differences between control and treatment groups, there
were no significant differences in hematology, serum chemistries, urinalysis,
and analgesia.  The heart rate returned to normal faster as the level of the
yohimbine dose given increased through 0.05 mg/lb.  One dog was excluded from
the test due to a mistake in dosing. <p>
For the variables MAT (mean arousal time)  and MWT (mean walk time), a model
fitting procedure using Anderson and Nelson's Linear Plateau models and
polynomial regression models was done on the least squares means of the
response times to help determine the recommended dose level. <p>
For both MAT and MWT the Linear Plateau Model III, (1) fit very well. This model
is a straight line between 0 (placebo) and 0.01 mg/lb dose and a plateau from
0.01 mg/lb to 0.25 mg/lb. <p>
<li><b>5).  Conclusions Drawn From the Study: </b><p>
Yobine(TM) was safe when dosed I.V. at 0.01 to 0.25 mg/lb after treatment with
xylazine and was effective at doses of 0.05 to 0.25 mg/lb in reversing the
pharmacologic and toxicologic effects of xylazine. <p>

with yohimbine, 4-aminopyridine,
and doxapram in dogs.  <i>Am J Vet Res</i>&#160; 46:371-375,
1985. <p>
Groups of atropinized dogs (six dogs/group) were sedated with xylazine IM, 2
mg/kg.  When recumbent dogs were given IV saline, yohimbine (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2
mg/kg) 4-aminopyridine
(0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mg/kg), doxapram (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg) or the
smallest doses of these antagonists as dual or triple combinations. <p>
Control MAT and MWT were 15.5 and 24.8 minutes respectively.  The 
antagonists reduced these values to yield equipotent doses(mg/kg) of yohimbine,
0.2, 4-AP, 0.6 and doxapram 0.5. <p>
Two additional groups were given an overdose of xylazine of 11 mg/kg, IM.  One
group was given saline, the other yohimbine, 0.4mg/kg.  Control MAT-MWT
were 41.5 and 144.5 minutes, respectively.  Yohimbine decreased these values to
2.2 and 2.5 minutes, respectively. <p>
Yohimbine was the most effective of the three agents stated. Combinations of
yohimbine, 4-AP
and doxapram did not offer a real advantage over yohimbine alone. <p>

<li>Hsu WH:  Effect of yohimbine on xylazine-induced
central nervous system depression in dogs.  <i>JAVMA</i>&#160; 182:698-699, 1983. <p>
Intravenous injection of xylazine (1 to 10 mg/kg) introduced a  
dose dependent CNS depression that was <b>prevented</b> by a low dosage of yohimbine
(0.1 mg/kg, IV).  Xylazine at a dosage of 10 mg/kg induced convulsions in three
of five dogs.  In addition, the CNS depressant effect of xylazine (1 to 10
mg/kg) was <b>reversed</b> by yohimbine at dosages ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg.
The author concluded that yohimbine at a dosage of 0.1 mg/kg IV is suitable as
an antagonist to control the duration and depth of xylazine induced CNS
depression. <p>

prolongation of gastrointestinal transit in dogs. <i>JAVMA</i>&#160; 183:297-300, 1983. <p>
The normal mean time for barium sulfate to move from the stomach to the
duodenojejunal junction was 4.8 &#177; 1.2 minutes.  An IV injection of
xylazine (1 mg/kg) prolonged the mean time to 157 &#177; 37.8 minutes.  Yohimbine
0.1 mg/kg IV did not affect gastrointestinal mobility.  It did, however,
prevent both the gastrointestinal and sedative effects of xylazine. <p>

blood pressure in conscious dogs, as influenced by atropine, 4-aminopyridine,

1985. <p>
The effect of xylazine on heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood 
pressure (ABP) was studied in 5 male dogs.  IV injection (1 mg/kg) caused a
decrease in HR accompanied by sinus arrhythmia plus an initial increase in ABP
followed by a decrease. <p>
Atropine sulfate (0.045 mg/kg, IM) increased ABP and HR but prevented xylazine
induced bradycardia in only 3 of 5 dogs. Yohimbine given IV (0.1 mg/kg)
antagonized hypertension, hypotension and bradycardia induced by xylazine.
Doxapram and 4-aminopyridine
were not found to be beneficial. <p>

gastrointestinal transit in dogs:  Reversal by yohimbine and

The effects of yohimbine and doxapram on xylazine induced prolongation of
gastroduodenal transit of barium sulfate were studied in 5 dogs. Base line time
from stomach to duodenojejunal junction was 5.6 &#177; 4.0 minutes.
Xylazine (IV 1 mg/kg) prolonged time to 95 &#177; 14.6 minutes. <p>
 
Yohimbine (IV 0.1 mg/kg) reversed gastrointestinal and sedative effects of
xylazine (time dropped to 22 &#177; 5.7 minutes). <p>
Doxapram alone prolonged time to 43.0 &#177; 22.8 minutes while when
given in combination with xylazine, transit time increased to 148.0 &#177; 32.7 minutes. <p>
It was concluded that yohimbine is effective as an antidote to reverse the
xylazine induced prolongation of gastrointestinal transit, whereas doxapram has
no value. <p>

Dogs (6 controls, 8 principals) were anesthetized to stage III-2
with thiopental once a week.  Immediately after IV injection, the dogs were
given an IV injection of an amphetamine isomer, physostigmine, oxotremorine, or
<b>yohimbine</b>, 0.5 mg/kg.  Amphetamines and yohimbine shortened duration of
anesthesia.  A combination of yohimbine and d-amphetamine
<b>reversed</b> thiopental anesthesia. Further emphasis of this research was on dose
titration with the combinations. <p>

1982. <p>
Groups of fasted atropinized dogs were given xylazine 2.2 mg/kg IM. When fully
sedated, the dogs were given IV 4-aminopyridine
(4-AP) (0.3 mg/kg), yohimbine (0.125 mg/kg) or a combination of 4-AP
&#43; yohimbine in weekly trials.  Control groups were given saline solution.  Two
additional groups were given a 5x dose of xylazine (11 mg/kg) IM. One group was
given 4-AP &#43; yohimbine IV, the other was given saline. <p>
Four AP decreased MWT to six min from 14.1 and 17.8 minutes.  Mean total
recovery time (TRT) was not affected.  Yohimbine decreased MWT to 2.2 minutes
and reduced TRT to 0.4 hours (from 0,8 and 2.7 hours).  In the 5x groups, the
combination reduced MWT  to 1.4 and 1.9 minutes and the TRT to 0.5 hours. <p>

This literature reference has also been cited as a corroborative study for
effectiveness.  The authors used a 1x, 2x and 4x dose of yohimbine in their

Thirty-two mongrel dogs, both sexes, 9.5-40
kg weight were randomly divided into 8 groups.  The dogs were given single IV
treatments of 0.9&#37; saline, reserpine, yohimbine or reserpine-yohimbine
mixtures. Each animal was anesthetized to the point of blockage of the corneal
reflex by slow IV titration of a 30&#37; solution of urethan. Direct femoral
arterial blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate were recorded
kymographically.  A standard dose of epinephrine was determined, IV, for each
animal.  After 2 control injections of the standard dose of epinephrine, 1
of the 8 treatments was administered, femoral vein, at zero time.
Recording of blood pressure and other physiological paramenters
was continued throughout the 300 minute observation period.  Yohimbine
doses were 0.1 mg and 1.0 mg/kg body weight respectively.  The 0.1 mg/kg dose
did not change epinephrine depressor response, heart rate (HR), blood pressure
or epinephrine pressor response. However, a 1.0 mg/kg dose produced marked
changes in blood pressure, epinephrine pressor response and epinephrine
depressor response.  None of the animals in the yohimbine groups died. <p>

 <b>IV.        EFFECTIVENESS</b> <P>
 <b>Animal Effectiveness</b>    <p>
The salinomycin NADA (128-686) established that salinomycin 40 to 60 g/ton
(0.0044 - 0.0066&#37;   is a safe and effective aid "for the prevention of
coccidiosis  in  broiler chickens caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix,  E.
acervulina, E.maxima, E. brunetti ,</i> and <i>E. mivati" .</i><p>   
It has been established  in  approved NADA's that  bacitracin  zinc  and
roxarsone are both safe and effective    for use  in finished feeds for growing
chickens and indicated for use to increase rate of gain and improve   feed
efficiency. This application contains data   establishing that the action of each
agent acts    independently of the other (additive) to increase weight   gain and
improve feed efficiency while in the presence of   salinomycin.  These data
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the combined use of bacitracin
zinc-salinomycin-roxarsone when used in finished feeds    containing bacitracin
zinc 0.0011 to 0.0055&#37; (10 to 50 g/ton) and salinomycin 0.0044 to 0.0066&#37;
(40 to 60 g/ton)  and roxarsone 0.00375&#37; (34.1 g/ton) for the prevention
of   coccidiosis in growing chickens caused by <i>Eimeria 
tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti </i>, and <i>E.
mivati </i>&#160;and for increasing rate of gain  and to improve feed efficiency. 
These data likewise   demonstrate that bacitracin zinc does not interfere
with    the anticoccidial activity of salinomycin. <P>
   
The approved salinomycin plus roxarsone NADA 132-447, established that the
addition of roxarsone (3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid) at a concentration of
0.005&#37;  to finished feeds containing salinomycin sodium between  the
range of 0.0044 to 0.0066&#37; is safe and effective for the prevention of
coccidiosis,in broiler chickens caused  by <i>E. necatrix, E. acervulina,  E.
brunetti</i> , and <i>E. mivati</i>, including some field strains of <i>E.
tenella</i>&#160; that are more susceptible to roxarsone combined with
salinomycin than the salinomycin alone. <p>
 
 <b>A.  Summary of Drug Noninterference Studies</b> <p>
Two-week old, Hubbard x Hubbard, broiler chickens were used in adequate,
well-controlled, 2-week, battery studies in a uniform environment with continuous
artificial illumination to test for noninterference<i> </i>of bacitracin zinc
with the effectiveness of salinomycin and roxarsone.  Recent field strain
isolates collected from various broiler-producing regions of the United States
were used.  For each study, combinations of <i>E. mivati, E. brunetti</i>, and,
<i>E. necatrix </i>, or  <i>E. acervulina, E. maxima</i>, and <i>E.  tenella</i>
were used.  This facilitated identification of lesions. <p>
 
These studies (Tables I and II) were conducted by using the lowest approved level
of salinomycin (40  g/ton) in the finished feed.    The experimental 
treatment groups included uninfected unmedicated    controls, infected
unmedicated controls, infected  groups receiving 40 g/ton of salinomycin with
and    without 100 g/ton bacitracin zinc or roxarsone, 100 g/ton
bacitracin zinc alone, 100 g/ton bacitracin zinc plus 45 g/ton roxarsone, and
40 g/ton    salinomycin and 45 g/ton roxarsone plus 100 g/ton bacitracin
zinc.  The protocols were designed to show   "noninterference", of each
component with the others  for the bacitracin zinc-salinomycin combination
and the bacitracin zinc-salinomycin-roxarsone combination. <p>
 In each of these studies, all pens were preselected, birds were randomized
by weight and assigned to cages with 10 birds/cage, and 4 replicates were used
per treatment group.  Groups were medicated 2 days before infection was
administered.  Evaluations were by lesion scores (analysis was performed on
preselected birds from each pen), dropping scores, weight gains, and feed
conversions. <P>

 <b>B.  Floor-Pen Studies</b> <p>
 Three, adequate and well-controlled, floor-pen studies, using
approximately 9600 broiler chickens (equal number of male and female), were
conducted under simulated actual use to determine the growth promoting and feed
efficiency effects of bacitracin zinc in the presence of salinomycin plus
roxarsone. All diets were balanced to provide adequate levels of nutrients
(protein, energy, minerals, etc.).  The same general experimental design was
used in all studies.  All chickens were maintained from one day of age to
market weight.  The studies were conducted in 3 geographical
areas. <P>
These studies were conducted as a 2 x 4 experimental design.  Bacitracin zinc (0
and 50 g/ton) and roxarsone (0, 22.7, 34.1 and 45.4 g/ton) served as the two
trial factors.  Pens were randomly assigned to treatment within blocks; 50 to 60
birds, equally divided by sex, were selected at random and assigned to pens; 6 to
8 replicates were used per treatment group.  Salinomycin, 60 g/ton (.0066&#37;)
was fed  in  the diet to all treatment groups.  Studies were designed to simulate varying
conditions, such as geographical locations, differences in climate, changes in
weather, differences in management practices, and degree of disease contamination
of the premises. <p>
Data were collected for the evaluation of bacitracin zinc and roxarsone alone and
in combination for increasing rate of weight gain and improving feed efficiency
in the presence of the highest recommended level of the anticoccidial drug
(salinomycin, .0066&#37;).  Parameters of evaluation included mortality, body
weights and feed to body weight gain  ratio.<p>
 Birds medicated with the drug combinations were healthy throughout the
study periods as evidenced by a survival rate of over 97&#37; for all studies.
There were no adverse drug toxicity effects observed. <P>
 
A detailed examination of the 3 trials (Table III) was conducted. Data from the 3
studies were combined and an analysis of variance (weighted by 1ocation)
conducted.  Table IV defines the treatment groups and Tables V and VI gives the
means for body weight and feed efficiency by location and averaged across
locations by treatment group.  The overall dose-titration analysis for weight
gain showed a significant treatment difference in favor of bacitracin zinc
(P&#61;.0001), while the overall analysis for feed efficiency showed a marginally
significant (P&#61;.108)  difference in favor of roxarsone.  Linear plateau models
were fit to the feed efficiency data to determine the optimum dose.  The best
fitting model showed no difference between levels 0 and 22.7, but a marked drop
to a plateau beginning at leve1 34.2. <P>

 The above data satisfy the requirements for approval under the CVM Policy
outlined in the guidelines for combination drugs revised October, 1983. The
policy provides for granting a range approval for production drugs in
combination when the maximum level tested for the claim is demonstrated to make
a significant benefit to the combination. The range approval for bacitracin
zinc for weight gain, according to the revised policy, is from 50 g/ton to the
minimum approved level for bacitracin zinc in the parent application of 4
g/ton.  However, a minimum use level of 10 g/ton of bacitracin zinc was used in
establishing the feed stability data for the combination.  Accordingly, 10
g/ton of bacitracin zinc is the minimum approvable level. Linear-plateau models
demonstrated that roxarsone for feed efficiency makes an optimal contribution
at 34.1 g/ton.  Thus the recommended use levels for this application are
bacitracin zinc 10-50 g/ton plus 40-60 g/ton salinomycin, plus 34.1 g/ton
roxarsone in broiler chicken rations. <p>

 <b>V.        ANIMAL SAFETY</b> <P>
The original approved NADA's for salinomycin (NADA D-128-686), bacitracin zinc
(NADA 46-920) and for roxarsone (NADA 7-891, MF-l9-roxarsone) contained adequate
data to establish the safety of each drug for broiler chickens. <p>
The safety of the combined use of the 3 drugs was demonstrated  in the drug
residue elimination study, the floor-pen studies and the compatibility battery
studies described  in  this document. Birds in the drug elimination studies were 
in  good health throughout the study and did not have any gross pathology at
sacrifice.  The birds in both the battery and floor-pen studies receiving the
drug combinations showed no signs of drug toxicity as evidenced by both gross
necropsy examination, weight gain and/or feed efficiency data.  Mortality data
for each study was within an acceptable range, and there was no evidence of any
toxicity which could be attributed to the combined use of the 3 drugs. <P>
Based on the data in the parent NADAs, the compatibility battery studies, the
drug elimination residue study, and the floor-pen studies, we conclude that the
combination be fed to broiler chickens as indicated by the label.<P>
 These data provide evidence for the combination of bacitracin zinc 10-50
g/ton; salinomycin 40-60 g/ton; and roxarsone 34.1 g/ton in the feed of broiler
chickens that is consistent with and fulfills all the requirements for a fixed
combination drug for animals as follows: <ul><P>
 
<LI> A.  Each drug component makes a contribution to  
 to the   claimed effects.<P>                             
 <LI>B.  The dosage level of each drug component is such the combination is safe and
effective for the purposes claimed. <P>
<LI>C. For a significant animal patient population that is affected by a
significant disease condition, <i>Eimeria tenella</i>&#160; is a major and widespread etiological
organism for coccidiosis and the most pathogenic <i>Eimeria</i>&#160; species for chickens and, as
such, possess the potential of causing extensive economic losses to broiler producers. <p>
<LI>D.  The label claims are not antagonistic. </ul><p>
 <b>VI.      HUMAN SAFETY</b> <P>
 <b>A.  Data to Support Human Safety</b> <p>
Safety for the approved products -- bacitracin zinc (Baciferm), salinomycin
(Bio-Cox), and roxarsone (3-Nitro) --  has been established by data submitted in
their respective original NADA's, NADA 46-920, NADA 128-686, and NADA 7-891 and
Salsbury Master File 19.<P>
 Tolerances for residues of bacitracin zinc  in  edible tissue of
chickens is established at 0.5 ppm (21 CFR Section 556.70).  Safe
concentrations of salinomycin  in  the edible tissues  of  chickens
are 0.6 ppm for muscle, 1.8 ppm for liver and 1.2 ppm for skin/fat. Tolerances
for residues of arsenic  in  the edible tissue of chickens are established
at 0.5 ppm in muscle and 2 ppm in   edible by-products (21 CFR
556.60). <p>
 <b>B.  Residue Depletion/Noninterference Studies</b> <p>
 The residue data supporting the approved individual use of
bacitracin zinc, salinomycin, and roxarsone and their established withdrawal
times of zero, zero, and 5 days respectively, have been submitted in their
respective applications (see Part A, above). <P>
 The following study, submitted by A.H. Robins under NADA's 137-536 and
135-746, establishes that the residues of each drug in the presence of the
others is neither influenced nor exceed the established safe concentration or
tolerance at their established withdrawal times, and that they do not interfere
in each other's tissue residue assays. <P>
One hundred broilers, one day old, were treated for 46 days with   the
three-way combination of salinomycin (80 g/ton), bacitracin  zinc (100 g/ton),
and roxarsone (45 g/ton).  Tissues were    collected and analyzed as shown in
Table VII. From the residue     data in Table VII both bacitracin zinc and
roxarsone (as arsenic)   are below their established tolerances of 0.5 ppm and
2 ppm at   their established withdrawal times of zero and five days  
respectively.  Under NADA 128-686, Robins Company established a    research
Rm, or tolerance, of 0.68 ppm for parent salinomycin in   skin/fat.  The
residue data in Table VII for salinomycin confirms  that, at zero withdrawal,
the concentration of salinomycin is    below the research Rm of 0.68 ppm and
is similar to the value for  salinomycin residues in skin/fat when salinomycin
was used alone.<p>

</pre>
A non-interference study for bacitracin zinc was conducted by spiking 
control muscle tissue with 0.5 ppm
bacitracin zinc and 80 ppb of salinomycin.  There was no detectable assay
interferences caused by   salinomycin when assaying for bacitracin zinc 
in chicken muscle.  Reference is made to
Internationa1 Minerals &amp; Chemical NADA P-136-484, that demonstrates that
arsenic in the presence of bacitracin zinc in turkey muscle does not interfere
with the bacitracin zinc assay.<p>
 These data support a 5-day withdrawal time for the bacitracin
zinc-salinomycin-roxarsone combination. <p>
 A regulatory analytical method for salinomycin is not required.  A
practical analytical method for determination of tissue residue of bacitracin
zinc and roxarsone is available  in  the Food Additives Analytical Manual
on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Room (Room 12A-30), 5600 Fishers
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. <P>
 <b>VII.     AGENCY CONCLUSIONS           </b> <p>
 The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that the combination of
salinomycin, bacitracin zinc, with roxarsone given at the recommended dosage,
according to the direction on the labeling is safe and effective for the
prevention of coccidiosis, for increased rate of weight gain, and for improved
feed efficiency in broiler chickens.  Each of the active ingredients has
been approved for use separately. The sponsor has demonstrated that each drug
in the combination has depleted to or below its level of tolerance or safe
concentrations following a 5-day withdrawal period.<p>
    This original NADA is regarded as a Category II application
under CVM's supplemental policy (42 CFR 64367) which did not require 
reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent NADA.  The approval
of this application will not significantly increase the exposure of
consumers to residues of the drugs. The drugs in combination are safe to be
fed to broiler chickens to be slaughtered for human consumption.<p>

Five treatments (Tables 1 to 4) were replicated four times using four poults
per replicate in ten-day-old turkeys in an environment free of coccidia prior
to the initiation of the experiment.  Water and medicated feed were supplied <I>ad
libitum</I>, and proper ambient temperature and a constant lighting schedule were
maintained for the duration of each experiment.  A typical medicated turkey
starter ration was provided for two days prior to the coccidial exposure and
fed thereafter.  Rations were assayed for BMD&#174;, and COBAN&#174;,.  Assayed
levels were found to contain appropriate levels of each drug.  Forty-eight
hours after the initiation of each experiment, each bird was inoculated with
sporulated oocysts of one of the following <i>Eimeria adenoeides; E.
meleagrimitis; E. gallopavonis;</i>&#160;or a combination of all the
aforementioned species.<P>
In each experiment, all treatment groups (with the exception of the
noninfected, nonmedicated control group) were infected with coccidia.
Parameters measured were mortality, weight gain, feed efficiency and lesion
scores at six days following inoculation.  Data were statistically evaluated
using Analysis-of Variance.  Means were compared using mean separation
procedures.  Means and replications are presented in Tables 1 to 4.<P>

The results of these tests indicate that COBAN&#174;, in the presence of
BMD&#174;, effectively controlled coccidial infections when performance,
lesion scores and mortality were evaluated.  The addition of BMD&#174;, had no
adverse effect on the ability of COBAN&#174;, to control coccidial
infections.<P>
<B>Floor-Pen Non-Challenge Studies</B><P>
Three floor pen studies were conducted using 1840 birds.  BMD&#174;, was used
at 50 grams per ton in combination with COBAN&#174;, at 90 grams per ton of
feed.  The experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of BMD&#174;, in
the presence of COBAN&#174;, on body weight gain and feed efficiency.<P>

Poults were housed in a steel truss building with insulated roof, sidewalls,
and a three foot curtain along each side.  Temperature and ventilation were
regulated using thermostatically-controlled fans and an automatic curtain.
Evaporative cooling was employed as needed to maintain normal temperature.  A
thermostatically-controlled gas brooder was used to maintain brooding
temperature of 90&#176;F for the first seven days of the study with a gradual
5&#176;F per week decrease in temperature until a 70&#176;F temperature was
maintained.  Lighting was provided 23 hours per day.  Pens were arranged in
four rows; each pen measured 7 ft x 8 ft.  Two hanging tube feeders and an
automatic waterer were used in each pen.  Plastic feeder lids and water jars
were used for the first seven days to provide supplemental feed and water.
Feed and water were provided <i>ad libitum</i>.  The basal diets were
formulated to meet or exceed all NRC nutrient recommendations.  Medicated diets
were prepared by mixing the indicated amount of each premix, supplied by the
sponsor, with the appropriate amount of basal feed.  Samples of each batch of
medicated feed were assayed for drug content.  Poults of the Large White,
Nicholas strain were obtained from a commercial hatchery and distributed
randomly by sex into 32 pens, so that 16 pens contained 18 males each and 16
pens contained 22 females each.  The 32 pens used in this study permitted eight
replications of males and females for each treatment group.  Treatments
(COBAN&#174;, 90 grams per ton; BMD&#174;, 50 grams per ton) were assigned to
pens in a randomized block design.  Birds were weighed by pens at study
termination (101 days-of-age for females and 115 days-of-age for males).  All
pens of turkeys were checked daily during the study.<P>

pens of turkeys were checked a minimum of twice daily during the study.<P>
<b>Summary of Floor-Pen Non-Challenge Studies</b> <P>
The three described floor-pen studies, using 1840 turkey poults (832 males and
1008 females), were conducted under conditions simulating actual field use to
determine the growth promoting effects of BMD&#174; in the presence of
COBAN&#174;. The series of studies was designed and conducted to simulate
varying climatic and geographical conditions, weather, and management
practices.<P>
The General Linear Model (GLM) Procedure of the Statistical Analysis System
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1988) was used to conduct the statistical
analyses of these data.  Data was analyzed separately for tom and hen turkeys.
Analysis-of-Covariance was conducted for each study using a statistical model
that included a covariate adjusting for differences in pen densities.
Bartlett's test was performed on the mean square errors from each study.  The
data from all three studies was pooled for determination of treatment effects.
The pooled analysis for feed efficiency data in tom turkeys consisted of a
weighted Analysis-of-Covariance because Bartlett's test indicated heterogeneity
of variances among studies.  The weights used were the inverse of the root mean
square error for each study.  The pooled analysis for average daily gain and
mortality data (in hen and tom turkeys) and for feed efficiency data (in hen
turkeys) was an unweighted Analysis-of-Covariance because Bartlett's test
indicated that mean square errors were homogeneous.  The Analysis-of-Covariance
statistical model included a covariate adjusting for differences in pen
density. Percent mortality was analyzed using an arcsine, square root
transformation.<P>
Results from these studies are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.  The pooled study
statistical analyses demonstrated that BMD&#174; in the presence of COBAN&#174;
increases average daily gain (P &lt;= 0.05 and P &lt;= 0.005; for tom and hen
turkeys, respectively) and improves feed efficiency (P &lt;= 0.015 and P &lt;=
0.032; for tom and hen turkeys, respectively).  There was no effect of
BMD&#174; in the presence of COBAN&#174; on mortality.  <P>

In accordance with CVM's guideline entitled "Guideline for Drug Combinations
for Use in Animals" (October 1983), Elanco Animal Health is permitted the range
of 4 to 50 grams per ton of BMD&#174; (21 CFR &#167; 558.76(d)(1)(i)),
and 54 to 90 grams per ton of COBAN&#174; (21 CFR &#167;
558.355(f)(2)(i)), in Type C medicated feed.  The data support range approval
because both BMD&#174; and COBAN&#174;" were previously approved for these
ranges, the data demonstrate that BMD&#174; and COBAN&#174; in combination
contributes in the manner claimed on the label at a dosage within the approved
range.  The data from the battery challenge studies and floor-pen non-challenge
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of COBAN&#174; and BMD&#174; for the
prevention of coccidiosis, improved feed efficiency and increased rate of
weight gain.<P>
<B>V. ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><P>
The basic animal safety data for the individual drugs may be found in NADA
46-592 for BMD&#174; and NADA 130-736 for COBAN&#174;.  The effectiveness
studies described in Section IV demonstrate that no ill effects occurred when
the drugs were combined indicating that they are as safe when fed in
combination as when fed alone.<P>
This application is in accord with the CVM's Target Animal Safety Guidelines
for New Animal Drugs (June 1989).  Additional safety studies were not required
because:  (1) the drugs have been approved singularly and (2) adequate
documentation has been provided to show that these compounds are compatible in
combination when used in turkey feeds.  Therefore, based on the data in the
original NADA's, the non-interference studies, the floor-pen efficacy studies
and the drug residue elimination study, it is concluded that this combination
of drugs may be safely fed to growing turkeys.<P>
<b>VI. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
<b>A. Toxicity Tests</b><P>
The basic toxicity data for the bacitracin methylene disalicylate may be found
in NADA 46-592 sponsored by A.L. Laboratories, (approved 15 March 1976, 41 FR
10793; and approved 14 August 1981, 46 FR 41041); for monensin, the data may be
found in NADA 38-878 sponsored by Elanco Products Co., (approved 20 May 1970,
35 FR 7734), and NADA 130-736 monensin for turkeys (approved 30 April 1987, 52
FR 15718).<P>
<b>B. Tolerances and Safe Concentration of Residues</b><P>
The tolerance for residues of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD&#174;) in
uncooked edible tissues is established at 0.5 ppm as negligible residue, (21
CFR &#167; 556.70).  A Tolerance for monensin (COBAN&#174;) residues is
not needed (21 CFR &#167; 556.420).<P>
The safe concentrations for total monensin in uncooked edible turkey tissues
are:  1.5 ppm in muscle, 3.0 ppm in skin with adhering fat, and 4.5 ppm in
liver.<P>
<b>C. Tissue Residue Depletion Studies</b><P>
A tissue residue study was conducted to demonstrate that there is no change in
the residue depletion pattern for each drug when bacitracin methylene
disalicylate and monensin were fed to turkeys in a two-drug combination.  There
were two segments to the study:  (1) validation of the assay by assaying spiked
tissue samples with the cited drugs, and (2) assays for bacitracin methylene
disalicylate and monensin conducted on tissue samples harvested from medicated
birds raised in commercial production.  Five male and five female turkeys were
medicated with monensin (90 g/ton) and BMD&#174; (200 g/ton) for 27 days and
slaughtered at zero withdrawal (6 hr).  The tissues were assayed for monensin
(skin fat) and BMD&#174; (muscle).  All tissues tested showed less than 0.04
ppm of monensin and less than 0.3 ppm of BMD&#174;, which are the respective
limits of detection for these assays.  These results are comparable to those
obtained when each drug is administered alone.<P>
These data confirm that each drug in the presence of the other does not exceed
its approved safe concentration or tolerance.  Therefore, these data support a
zero withdrawal period for human consumption of turkeys treated with bacitracin
methylene disalicylate plus monensin in the feed under CVM's combination drug
policy.<P>
<b>D. Assay Non-interference Study</b><P>
<b>1. Bacitracin Methylene Disalicylate Assay</b><P>
Tissue assay non-interference and method validation studies for bacitracin
methylene disalicylate tissue assay were conducted by spiking control samples
with bacitracin methylene disalicylate and monensin and then assaying for
bacitracin methylene disalicylate residues.  The assay results demonstrated
that there is no interference by monensin for bacitracin methylene
disalicylate.  (AAC8722).<P>
<b>2. Monensin Assay</b><P>
Tissue assay non-interference and method validation studies for monensin tissue
assay were conducted by spiking control samples with bacitracin methylene
disalicylate and monensin and then assaying for monensin residues.  The assay
results demonstrated that there is no interference by bacitracin methylene
disalicylate for monensin.  (AAC8722).<P>

<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that COBAN&#174;, (54-90 g/ton) plus
BMD&#174;, (4-50 g/ton) are safe and effective for the claims indicated in
Section II of this FOI summary.<P>
Pursuant to 21 CFR &#167; 514.106 (b)(2), this combination NADA approval
is regarded as a Category II supplemental change which did not require a
reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent NADAs.  The drugs are to
be fed in Type C medicated feeds, in accordance with Section II and III of the
FOI Summary and the Blue Bird labeling that is attached to this document. <P>
Residue data show monensin is well within the established safe concentrations
of 4.5 ppm in liver, 3.0 ppm skin/fat and 1.5 ppm muscle of the turkey at zero
withdrawal.  Residue data show bacitracin methylene disalicylate is well below
tolerance of 0.5 ppm in edible turkey tissues at zero withdrawal.<P>
The battery challenge studies demonstrated that COBAN&#174;, in the presence of
BMD&#174;, prevented coccidiosis when the birds were exposed to the three major
species of Eimeria infecting turkeys.  The data from three floor-pen
non-challenge studies demonstrate the effectiveness of BMD&#174;, (50 g/ton) in
the presence of COBAN&#174;, (90 g/ton) for increased rate of weight gain and
improved feed efficiency.  In accordance with CVM's guideline entitled
"Guideline for Drug Combinations for Use in Animals" (October 1983), Elanco
Animal Health is permitted the range of 4 to 50 grams per ton of BMD&#174;, and
54 to 90 grams per ton of COBAN&#174; in the Type C medicated feed for
prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria adenoeides, E.
meleagrimitis</i>, and <i>E. gallopavonis;</i>&#160;and for increased rate
of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in turkeys, as shown in Section II
of this FOI summary.<P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the FFDCA, this approval for food producing
animals qualifies for three years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because the application contains reports of new clinical or
field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential
to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.<P><HR> <P> Return to <A HREF="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/fda/infores/foi/foidocs.html">FOI Page</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cvm.fda.gov/default.html">

<b>Date of Summary:</b>  August 16, 1995<p>
<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
 Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the
Agency grants a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study
(55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of
bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are
based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.  <p>
Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Fermenta
Animal Health Company was granted a waiver July 26, 1995, from conducting an
<i>in vivo</i>&#160;  bioequivalence study with Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection.  The
generic and pioneer products are solutions with the same inactive ingredients
and the same concentrations of the active ingredient.<p>
<b>3.   HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
<b> Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><p>
<b> </b>Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were
not required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is labeled for use in cats
and subhuman primates not intended for food.<p>
    <b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><p>
<b> </b>Labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<p>
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
<b> </b>This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under
Section 512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <p>
    Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Ketamine Hydrochloride
Injection (100 mg/mL), were established by demonstration of chemical
equivalence to the pioneer product, Fort Dodge Laboratories'
Vetalar&#174/Ketaset&#174; (ketamine hydrochloride, USP,100 mg/mL, NADA
045-290).<p>
    This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use.  The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical.  Both drugs are administered by intramuscular injection.  The
generic and pioneer products are both solutions that contain the same active
and inactive ingredients in the same concentrations.  Both products have the
same pH.  Therefore,  in compliance with FDA policy promulgated to implement
Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety, efficacy, or<i>
in vivo  </i>&#160; bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.  <p>
    This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection is safe and effective for
its labeled indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

<b>	2. INDICATIONS</b><p>

Oxytetracycline 200 is intended for use in the treatment of the following
diseases in beef cattle, nonlactating dairy cattle and swine when due to
oxytetracycline susceptible organisms.<p>

CATTLE<p>

Oxytetracycline 200 is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia and shipping
fever complex associated with <i>Pasteurella</i> spp. and <i>Hemophilus</i>
spp.; infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) caused by <i>Moraxella
bovis</i>; foot rot and diphtheria caused by <i>Fusobacterium necrophorum;</i>
bacterial enteritis (scours) caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>; wooden tongue
caused by <i>Actinobacillus lignieresi</i>; leptospirosis caused by
<i>Leptospira pomona</i>; and wound infections and acute metritis caused by
strains of staphylococci and streptococci organisms sensitive to
oxytetracycline. <p>

SWINE<p>

In swine, Oxytetracycline 200 is indicated in the treatment of bacterial
enteritis (scours, colibacillosis) caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>; pneumonia
caused by <i>Pasteurella multocida</i>; and leptospirosis caused by
<i>Leptospira pomona</i>.  <p>

In sows, Oxytetracycline 200 is indicated as an aid in the control of
infectious enteritis (baby pig scours, colibacillosis) in suckling pigs caused
by <i>Escherichia coli.</i> <p>

<b>3. DOSAGE</b><p>

CATTLE<p>

Oxytetracycline 200 is to be administered by intramuscular or intravenous
injection to beef cattle and nonlactating dairy cattle.<p>
A single dose of 9 mg of Oxytetracycline 200 per pound of body weight
administered intramuscularly is recommended in the treatment of the following
conditions:  1) bacterial pneumonia caused by <i>Pasteurella</i> spp. (shipping
fever) in calves and yearlings, where retreatment is impractical due to
husbandry conditions, such as cattle on range, or where their repeated
restraint is inadvisable;  2) infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye)
caused by <i>Moraxella bovis</i>.<p>

Oxytetracycline 200 can also be administered by intravenous or intramuscular
injection at a level of 3 to 5 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of body weight
per day.  In the treatment of severe foot rot and advanced cases of other
indicated diseases, a dosage level of 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is
recommended.  Treatment should be continued 24 to 48 hours following remission
of disease signs; however, not to exceed a total of four consecutive days.
Consult your veterinarian if improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of
the beginning of treatment.<p>

SWINE<p>

A single dose of 9 mg of Oxytetracycline 200 per pound of body weight
administered intramuscularly is recommended in the treatment of bacterial
pneumonia caused by <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> in swine, where retreatment is
impractical due to husbandry conditions or where repeated restraint is
inadvisable.<p>

Oxytetracycline 200 can be administered by intramuscular injection at a level
of 3 to 5 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of body weight per day.  Treatment
should be continued 24 to 48 hours following remission of diseases signs;
however, not to exceed a total of four consecutive days.  Consult your
veterinarian if improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of the beginning
of treatment.<p>

For sows, administer once intramuscularly 3 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of
body weight approximately 8 hours before farrowing or immediately after
completion of farrowing.<p>

For swine weighing 25 lb of body weight and under, Oxytetracycline 200 should
be administered undiluted for treatment at 9 mg/lb but should be administered
diluted for treatment at 3 or 5 mg/lb.	<p>

<b>	4.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY and DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,
drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue
data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>

Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Pennfield
Oil Company was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>
bioequivalence study for oxytetracycline injection.  The generic and pioneer
products contain the same active and inactive ingredients and are parenteral
solutions. <p>
	
<b>5. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>

<i>Tolerance</i><p>

The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.   A tolerance of 0.1 ppm is established for the uncooked edible
tissues of cattle, beef calves, nonlactating dairy cattle, dairy calves, and
swine under 21 CFR 556.500. <p>

<i>Withdrawal Time</i><p>

When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence study is
granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product.  The withdrawal time for oxytetracycline injection is established
under 21 CFR 522.1660: 28 days for beef cattle, nonlactating dairy cattle, and
swine. <p>

<i>Regulatory Method for Residues</i><p>

The analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is the cylinder
plate microbiological test using Bacillus <i>cereus</i> var. <i>mycoides</i>
(ATCC 11778) as outlined in the "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products
and Animal Tissues:  Methods, Reports, and Protocols" October 1968, National
Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, FDA, Washington, D.C.
20204.<p>

<b>6. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>

This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that oxytetracycline injection when used under the proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

<B>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as 
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (<B>53 FR 
50460</B>, December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated 
New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic 
version of an approved new animal drug (pioneer product). For certain 
dosage forms, the Agency may grant a waiver from conducting an <I>in vivo </I>
bioequivalence study (<B>55 FR 24645</B>, June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy 
Letter). In lieu of bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of 
the generic product are based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to 
the pioneer product.<p>

Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Fort 
Dodge Laboratories was granted a waiver December 13, 1989 (photocopy 
attached) from conducting an <I>in vivo</I> bioequivalence study with Gentaglyde 
Solution. The generic and pioneer products are solutions with the same 
inactive ingredients and the same concentrations of the active 
ingredient.<p>

<B>3. HUMAN SAFETY:</B><p>

Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:<p>

Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were 
not required for approval of this ANADA. This drug is labeled for use in 
horses not intended for food.<p>

Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and 
Administration:<p>

Labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<p>

<B>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under 
Section 512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&C) Act.<p>

Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Gentaglyde 
Solution (gentamicin sulfate, 100 mg/mL), were established by 
demonstration of chemical equivalence to the pioneer product, 
Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation's Gentocin(R) Solution 
(gentamicin sulfate, 100 mg/mL, NADA 046-724) .<p>

This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling 
indications for use. The route and method of administration of the two 
drugs are identical. Both drugs are administered by intrauterine 
infusion. The generic and pioneer products are both solutions that 
contain the same active and inactive ingredients in the same 
concentrations. Both products have the same pH. Therefore, consistent 
with FDA policy implementing Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&C Act, no 
additional safety, efficacy, or in vivo bioequivalence studies were 
necessary or required.<p>

This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and 
demonstrates that Gentaglyde Solution is safe and effective for its 
labeled indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

 Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product). For certain dosage forms, the Agency
grants a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645,
June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter). In lieu of bioequivalence testing,
the safety and efficacy of the generic product are based on the demonstrated
chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.<p>
Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, American
Veterinary Products, Inc. was granted a waiver on June 4, 1992 (see section 4)
 from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study with ketamine
hydrochloride injection, USP. The generic and pioneer products are solutions
with the same inactive ingredients and the same concentrations of the active
ingredient.<p>

 Dear Dr. Komer:<p>
 We refer to your submission dated March 18, 1992 to the Investigational New
 Animal Drug (INAD) file for a generic copy of Fort Dodge's Vetalar&#174; (ketamine
 hydrochloride, 100 mg/ml, NADA 045-290).  The pioneer product is approved as a 
 restraining agent in cats and subhuman primates.  It can also be used as the sole
 anesthitic agent for diagnostic or minor, brief surgical procedures that do not
 requires skeletal muscle relaxation in cats.  You requested a waiver of the requirement 
 for an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study to support the filing of an
 Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) based on the Generic Animal
 Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA) of 1988.<p>
 The submission contains the following:<ol><p>
 <li>Copies of previous correspondence regarding the proposed product.<p>
 <li>Copies of the carton and illegible container labels and the package insert for 
 the pioneer product.<p>
 <Li>A list of the pH of the pioneer product, the proposed generic product, and the pH
 range from USP XXII.<p>
 <li>An itemized list of the active and inactive ingredients and their
 concentrations in the proposed product.<p>
 <li>Comparative ultra-violet spectrophotometric scans of the pioneer product and
 your proposed generic product.</ol><p>
 Your proposed generic product contains the same active and inactive ingredients
 in the same concentration as the pioneer product, Vetalar&#174;.<p>
 The final pH of your product conforms to that of the pioneer and to current USP 
 specifications.<p>
 Your request for a waiver of <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing is granted on the
 condition that the information in your ANADA continues to show that your
 proposed generic product is equivalent to the pioneer, Vetalar&#174;.<p>
 Granting of this waiver does not assure approval of your ANADA.  All necessary
 requirements must be fulfilled, including certification that your product or its proposed
 uses do not violate or infringe upon any patent or exclusivity for the
 pioneer product or its uses.<P>
 We have reviewed your request for waiver of bioequivalency tests under the National 
 Environmental Policy Act.  Since there are no investigations planned
 under this INAD, no wastes are expected to enter the environment.  Therefore, we
 have determined that this action qualifies under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(4) for categorical
 exclusion from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment (EA).  If
 any studies are planned under the INAD, please file either a claim for exclusion or
 an EA.<p>
 Future correspondence to your INAD file regarding this submission should be
 identified by the date of this letter and our file number, INAD 8257 (C001).<p>
 In submitting your ANADA, please refer to this number and include a copy of this
 correspondence in your original submission.<p>
 Should you have any questions or if we may be of further assistance, please
 contact Dr. Marcia K. Larkins, Chief, Companion and Wildlife Drugs Branch.  The
 telephone number is (301) 295-8614.<p>
 Sincerely yours,<p>

<b>5.     AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
 This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under
Section 512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act.<p> 
Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, ketamine hydrochloride
injection, USP, 100 mg/mL, were established by demonstration of chemical
equivalence to the pioneer product, Fort Dodge Laboratories 
Vetalar&#174;/Ketaset&#174;  (ketamine hydrochloride injection, USP, 100 mg/mL, NADA
045-290). Therefore, this ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of
the Act.<p>
This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use. The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical. Both drugs are administered by intramuscular injection. The
generic and pioneer products are both solutions that contain the same active
and inactive ingredients in the same concentrations. Both products have the
same pH. Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy promulgated to implement
Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety, efficacy, or <i>in
vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.<p>

prevent polymerization.<P>
<b>Trade Name:</b> PARASITE-S&#174;<P>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> Over-the-counter (OTC).<P>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>	July 31, 1992<P>
<b>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE</b><ul><P>
<LI>A. Formalin is indicated for the control of external parasites on 
cultured food fishes: salmon, trout, catfish, largemouth bass, and 
bluegill sunfish.<P>
Organisms controlled include the protozoa: <i>Ichthyophthirius</i> spp. ("Ich"),
<i>Chilodonella</i>  spp., <i>Costia</i> spp., <i>Scyphidia</i>  spp.,
<i>Epistylis</i> spp., and <i>Trichodina</i>  spp. and monogenetic trematodes:
<i>Cleidodiscus</i> spp., <i>Gyrodactylus</i>  spp., and <i>Dactylogyrus</i> 
spp.<P>
<LI>B. For control of fungi of the family Saprolegniaceae on salmon, 
trout, and esocid eggs.</ul><P>
<b>3. PRODUCT INFORMATION</b><P>
Dosage form, route of administration, and recommended dosage are 
discussed in the FOI Summary of Public Master File (PMF) 3543.<P>
<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS</b><P>

The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements 
of 512 of the Act and demonstrate that formalin, when used under its 
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the control of 
external protozoa and monogenetic trematodes on salmon, trout, 
catfish, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish, and for the control 
of fungi on salmon, trout, and esocid eggs.<P>
A tolerance is not required for fish because total residue data 
showed that mean concentrations of formalin residues at 12 hours 
after the last treatment (zero withdrawal) were not different from 
naturally-occurring formaldehyde, which is a product of autolysis.<P>
The proposed labeling is adequate to ensure the safe use of formalin 
by lay persons.  Therefore, this product is an over-the-counter (OTC) 
product.<p>

<B>Pioneer Product:</B>		Neomycin Soluble Powder (Neomix 325) NADA 11-315.<p>

<b>II.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data, drug
effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>

Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, the Wade Jones
Company  was granted a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>
bioequivalence study for the generic product NEO-SOL 50&#174; (neomycin sulfate
soluble powder). The generic product is administered as an oral solution and
contains the same active and inactive ingredient in the same concentration as
the pioneer product.  <p>

<b>III.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</b><p>

<i>Tolerance</i><p>

The tolerance established for the pioneer product apply to the generic product.
The tolerances established for neomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues
of cattle, swine, sheep, and goats are 1.2 ppm in muscle, 3.6 ppm in liver, 7.2
ppm for kidney (target tissue), and 7.2 ppm in fat, (21 CFR 556.430).<p>

<i>Withdrawal Time</i><p>

When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>  bioequivalence study
is granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product. <p>

The withdrawal times are 3 days for swine and goats, 2 days for sheep, and 1
day for cattle (excluding veal calves) (21 CFR 520.1484).<p>

<i>Regulatory Method for Residues</i><p>

The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> published by the
Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products and
Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols", revised October 1968,
reprinted December 1974.<p>

<b>IV.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>

<b>	</b>This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug,
And Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the Act and
demonstrates that neomycin sulfate soluble powder (NEO-SOL 50&#174;), when used
under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled
indications.<p>

            12340 Santa Fe Drive<br>
            Lenexa, Kansas  66215<P>

<b>Generic Name:</b> Iron Hydrogenated Dextran Injection<P>

<b>Trade Name:</b> None<P>

<b>Marketing Status:</b> OTC<P>

<b>Date of Approval:</b> August 6, 1985<P>


<b>2. Indications for Use</b><P>For the prevention and treatment of anemia due to
iron deficiency in baby pigs.<P><b>
3. Dosage Form</b><P>Injectable solution,
contains Iron Hydrogenated Dextran Injection equivalent to 100 mg elemental iron
per milliliter.<P><b>Route of Administration:</b> Intramuscular<P><b>Recommended
Dosages:</b><P>Prevention: 1 mL (100 mg iron) at 2 to 4 days of age.<P>
Treatment: 
1 mL (100 mg iron).  Treatment may be repeated in 10 days.<P>
<b>4,5.
Effectiveness and Animal Safety</b><P> An Iron Hydrogenated Dextran Injection
(Number 8, Rubrafer Improved&#174;) was reviewed by the National Academy of
Sciences-National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, which concluded
that the product was safe and effective for the prevention and treatment of
iron-deficiency anemia in pigs.  The Food and Drug Administration concurred with
the conclusions of the Academy (NAS/NRC DESI, 34 FR 2211, February 14, 1969) and
subsequently codified the product by regulation (21 CFR 522.1183).  Iron
Hydrogenated Dextran Injection by Veterinary Laboratories, Inc. is manufactured
from bulk Iron Hydrogenated Dextran Injection supplied by Chemdex, Inc., 3200
North 29th Avenue, Hollywood, Florida 33020.<P>Rubrafer Improved&#174; was also
manufactured from bulk Iron Hydrogenated Dextran Injection supplied by Chemdex,
Inc. at the time of the NAS/NRC review. Thus, the determination that Iron
Hydrogenated Dextran Injection manufactured by Veterinary Laboratories, Inc. is
the same as the NAS/NRC - reviewed product is based principally on both having
the same source of supply of bulk drug.<P><b>6. Human Safety</b><P> The Food and
Drug Administration has determined that there is no human safety concern for
residues resulting from the use of Iron Hydrogenated Dextran Injection in swine
under the regulated conditions of use.<P><b>7. Agency Conclusions</b><P>a.  The
data submitted in support of this NADA comply with Section 512 of the Act and
show that Iron Hydrogenated Dextran Complex when used under its proposed
conditions of use is safe and effective for the prevention and treatment of
anemia due to iron deficiency in baby pigs.<P>b.  The product is OTC.  All
related products listed under 21 CFR 522.1182 and 522.1183 are OTC, since it is
given as a common production practice to all neonatal swine in confinement. 
Adequate directions for use are on the labeling.<P> <b>8. Labeling</b><P>

* NOTE:  Make a cattle stock solution by adding 1 packet of SULFADIMETHOXINE 
Soluble Powder to 1 gallon of water 

** This dosage recommendation is based on a water consumption of 1
gallon per 100 lb of body weight per day, the expected water consumption
rate for summer.  Water consumption during cold months (winter) may drop
markedly (30 - 40%).  Accordingly, adjustments must be made in the
dilution rates to compensate for this and insure proper drug intake.

For treatment of individual cattle, Sulfadimethoxine Soluble Powder
stock solution for cattle may be given as a drench.  Administer using
same mg/lb dosage as outlined above.

Twenty fluid ounces of cattle stock solution will medicate one 600 lb
animal initially or two 600 lb animals on maintenance dose.  Contents of
packet will medicate six 600 lb animals initially or twelve 600 lb
animals on maintenance dose.

<b>4. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53
FR 50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated
new animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic
version of an approved new animal drug (pioneer product). New target
animal safety data, drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data
(other than tissue residue data) are not required for approval of an
ANADA. An ANADA relies on the target animal safety, drug effectiveness
and human food safety data in the pioneer's new animal drug application.
Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the generic product is
bioequivalent to the pioneer. If bioequivalence is demonstrated through
a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to establish the
withdrawal time for the generic product is also required. For certain
dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an in vivo
bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p> 

Based upon the
formulation characteristics of the generic product, AgriLabs Ltd. was
granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study for
sulfadimethoxine soluble powder. The generic product is administered as
an oral solution. It contains the same active ingredient and drug
concentration as the pioneer product. It is the same dosage form as the
pioneer and contains no inactive ingredients that may significantly
affect absorption of the active ingredient.<p>
<b>5. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance</b><p>
The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product. A 
tolerance of 0.1 ppm (negligible residue) is established for sulfadimethoxine
residues in the 
uncooked edible tissues of chickens, turkeys and cattle under 21 CFR
556.640.<p>
<b>Withdrawal Time</b><p>
When a waiver of the in vivo bioequivalence study is granted, the withdrawal
times are 
those previously assigned to the generic product.<p>
The withdrawal times are 5 days for chickens and turkeys, and 7 days for cattle
(21 CFR 
520.2220a).<p>
<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
The analytical method for detection of residues in tissue is the thin layer
densitometric 
procedure. This method is found in the Official <i>Methods of Analysis of the
Association of 
Official Analytical Chemists,</i>&#160; 15th edition, 1990.<p>
<b>6. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that 
sulfadimethoxine soluble powder, when used under its proposed conditions of
use, is safe 
and effective for its labeled indication.<p>

 <b>Generic Name:  </b>Narasin and Nicarbazin Type A Article  <p>
 <b>Trade Name:</b>     MAXIBAN&#174;  <p> 
 <b>Note:</b><p>  This application provides for making Type C medicated feed from a
Type A medicated article incorporating both narasin and nicarbazin.  <p> 
<b> Marketing Status:     </b> OTC  <p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>January 18, 1989<p> 
<b>II.  INDICATIONS FOR USE: </b>       <p> 
 For the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by <i>E.
necatrix, E. tenella, E. acervulina, E. brunetti, E. mivati,</i> and <i>E.
maxima  </i>.      <p> 
 <b>III. DOSAGE FORM:</b>  <p> 
 A 1:1 combination of narasin and nicarbazin is supplied as a Type A
medicated article in 50-pound bags for inclusion into broiler feeds. A premix
concentration of 36 g/lb (80 g/kg) of each narasin and nicarbazin is 
provided.  <p> 
 <b>Route of Administration</b>:
 Oral administration via the feed.  <p> 
 <b>Recommended Dosage:</b>  <p> 
 Narasin and nicarbazin (from MAXIBAN&#174;) at concentrations ranging from
27/27 g/ton to 45/45 g/ton of each in finished feeds. <p>
 <b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS:</b>      <p> 
 <b>Introduction</b>      <p> 
 Narasin Premix is approved (21 CFR  &#167;  558.363) for incorporation
into the rations of broiler chickens at levels of 54-72 g narasin/ton for the
prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria necatrix, E. tenella, E.
acerrulina, E. brunetti, E. mivati, </i>and <i>E. maxima.  </i>Nicarbazin is
also approved  
 (21 CFR  &#167;  558.366) for incorporation into broiler chicken
rations at 113.5 g/ton as an aid in prevention of outbreaks of cecal  
 (<i>Eimeria tenella  </i>) and intestinal (<i>Eimeria acerrulina, E. maxima,
E.   necatrix and E. brunetti </i>) coccidiosis in chickens.  Experiments have
shown that with the combination narasin plus nicarbazin superior control of all
species of coccidia is attained at reduced dosages of each drug and at
generally reduced net dosages.  <p> 
 Extensive tests have shown that a 1:1 ratio of the two drugs is optimal and
that a range of 27.3 g/ton (30 ppm) to 45.5 g/ton (50 ppm) of each narasin and
nicarbazin is effective depending upon the severity of the coccidial
challenge.  <p> 
 Effectiveness studies were conducted as follows: <ul> <p> 
<li> A. Battery trials - A series of ninety-four battery trials to evaluate the
anticoccidial dose response of a 1:1 combination of narasin and nicarbazin in
broiler chicken rations.  <p> 
<li> B. Floor pen trials - A series of thirteen trials to evaluate the
anticoccidial dose response of five levels of a 1:1 ratio of narasin and
nicarbazin under simulated field conditions. </ul> <p> 
 <b>Experimental Results</b>      <p> 
 <b>A.  Battery Trials</b> <p>
  


Ninety-four battery trials were conducted as dose response studies of a 1:1
combination of narasin and nicarbazin fed to broiler chickens.  The chickens in
each trial were inoculated with species of <i>Eimeria</i>&#160; as follows.<p>

 <b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS:</b>  <p> 
 <b>B.  Floor Pen Studies</b> <p>
 A series of 13 floor pen trials involving 216 pens of day-old
broiler cockerels and 214 pens of day-old broiler pullets were used to evaluate
the anticoccidial dose response of five levels of narasin and nicarbazin
maintained in a 1:1 ratio.   The trials were conducted in six geographical
locations with approximately 35,656 birds from five broiler strains. Treatments
evaluated were nonmedicated control and the continuous feeding of five
combinations of narasin and nicarbazin at 8/8,  18/18, 27/27, 36/36, or 45/45
g/ton for 43 to 46 days,  followed by a five day nonmedicated withdrawal
period.  On day 20, 21, 23 or 24 of the trials, additional litter containing
oocysts of recent field isolates of <i>Eimeria acerrulina, E. brunetti, E.
maxima, E. mivati, E. necatrix,</i> &#160;and <i>E. tenella </i>&#160;was distributed
equally to all experimental pens.  Six or seven days later approximately 10
percent of the birds in each pen were sacrificed and scored for coccidial
lesions.   Data from these 13 trials show a broad anticoccidial efficacy
range of narasin and nicarbazin in a 1:1 ratio.   These trials are summarized
in the following table:<p>

 The intestinal (2.45) and cecal (.77) lesion scores of those birds
receiving no anticoccidial treatment indicated the birds had been subjected to
a moderate intestinal and a low cecal coccidial challenge.  <p> 
 Intestinal lesion scores were decreased at each incremental increase in the
narasin and nicarbazin dose level.   Cecal lesion scores also were decreased at
each incremental increase until narasin and nicarbazin were each fed at 45/45
g/ton.  All narasin and nicarbazin treatment combinations decreased percent
mortality as compared to the birds receiving no anticoccidial treatment (3.45
to 4.29 vs 5.10 percent).  <p> 
 Final weights of birds fed narasin and nicarbazin each at 27/27, 36/36, or
45/45 g/ton were heavier than those fed narasin and nicarbazin at 18/18 g/ton.
These birds,  in turn, weighed more than those fed narasin and nicarbazin at
8/8 g/ton or those birds which received neither compound.  Each incremental
increase in the narasin and nicarbazin combinations improved feed/gain ratios
except between 27/27 and 36/36 g/ton.  No adverse effects were observed in any
of these trials.  <p>

<b>V.   ANIMAL  SAFETY </b><p>
 
 Narasin is approved (21 CFR  &#167;  558.630) for incorporation into
the rations of broiler chickens at levels of 54-72 g/ton, NADA 118-980 (51 FR
29098, August 14, 1986).  Nicarbazin is approved (21 CFR  &#167;  558.366)
for feeding to broiler chickens at 113.5 g/ton, NADA 135-468 (50 FR 13562,
April 5, 1985).  <p> 
 The present NADA contains data reflecting the effectiveness and safety of
the combination of these drugs at lower levels of each (22.7-45.4 g/ton of each
narasin and nicarbazin).  <p> 
 Animal safety studies were conducted as follows:  <p> 
 <b>A)  Floor Pen Studies</b> <p>
 A series of three studies to evaluate the safety of feeding narasin and
nicarbazin under simulated field conditions.  <p> 
<b> B)    Field Studies </b>  <p>
 A series of five trials under commercial use conditions.  <p> 
 <b>A.  Floor Pen Studies (No. 1)</b>      <p> 
 An experiment was designed to evaluate the safety of feeding 1:1
combinations of narasin and nicarbazin to broiler cockerels and pullets under
simulated use conditions.  Using a complete randomized block design, twenty-one
hundred and twenty newly hatched Hubbard x White Mountain broilers (1060
cockerels and 2060 pullets) were allotted randomly by sex to 40 floor pens of
53 birds each in a broiler house.  Treatments were 0&#43;0, 50&#43;50,
62.5&#43;62.5,150&#43;150 and 250&#43;250 ppm of narasin and nicarbazin, respectively, with
four pens of each sex per treatment.  Each pen was equipped with self feeders
and a waterer.  
 The treatments were fed <i>ad   libitum</i>&#160;   in crumbled feed during the first
four weeks and in pelleted feed during the last four weeks of the trial.  At
the end of the seven-week medicated feeding period, medicated feed was replaced
with nonmedicated feed and fed for five days.  Three randomly preselected birds
were removed from the experiment at four days and bled to provide blood samples
for prothrombin time determinations.   Five randomly preselected birds were
removed from each pen at the termination of the treatment period.   Blood was
collected from these birds for clinical pathology.   They were then sacrificed
for post-mortem examination and collection of preselected tissues for
histopathology.  Weight gain, feed consumption and feed gain ratios were
determined at four and seven weeks and after a five-day withdrawal period.
Mortality was recorded daily.  <p> 
 There were no treatment-related changes for any of the clinical pathology,
growth performance or mortality variables at the two low treatments of 50&#43;50 or
62.5&#43;62.5 ppm of the combination.   However, there were adverse dose-associated
changes for some of the clinical pathology, growth performance and mortality
variables for the two highest doses of 150&#43;150 and 250&#43;250 ppm of the
combination.  The most important finding in this study was congestive heart
failure characterized by dilated cardiac chambers, fluid accumulation in body
cavities and tissues, pulmonary and hepatic congestion and hepatic degeneration
or necrosis.   Congestive heart failure also occurred in seven chickens of the
two lowest dose groups, but was not associated with increased total mortality.
The incidence of congestive heart failure was associated with increased
mortality in the two highest dose groups and was both dose and sex 
 related.   Mortality was greater for the two highest doses and greater in
males than in females.   Congestive heart failure was noted in four males and
one female on the 50&#43;50 ppm narasin and nicarbazin combination dose and in two
male birds on the 62.5&#43;62.5 ppm narasin and nicarbazin combination
dose.  <p> 
 The low incidence of heart failure (1.25% and 0.5%) observed in the two low
dose groups was not clearly treatment-related because it was not associated
with increased total mortality and because similar effects in broiler chickens
have previously been attributed to a variety of causes.( Julian, R.J. and Wilson, J.B.   (1984),

</pre>
 
 In each study, 2100 one-day-old cockerels were randomly distributed to 14
concrete floor pens of 150 birds each in a facility modified for floor pens
studies.  All pens were equipped with gas-fired brooders, self-feeders and
automatic waterers.  Feed was crumbled during the first four weeks of the study
and pelleted during the last three weeks.   The study duration was 49 days on
medicated feed followed by a five-day withdrawal from medication.  <p> 
 Each pen was inspected twice a day for dead or moribund birds; these were
weighed and submitted for necropsy.  Other birds were observed for physical
signs of toxicity.   Growth performance data (weight gain, feed consumption,
and feed/gain ratio) were determined at four weeks, seven weeks and at the end
of a five-day withdrawal period.  At the termination of the medication
period,  
 randomly preselected birds per pen were killed for necropsy.   Tissues from
all major organ systems were examined grossly and microscopically.  <p> 
 Pooled data for the seven-week treatment plus five-day withdrawal period
indicated that mean mortality was increased in chickens fed 0 &#43; 125 and 250 &#43;
250 ppm narasin &#43; nicarbazin.   Increased mortality in the 0 &#43; 125 ppm
(narasin  
 nicarbazin) treatment groups was episodic and was related to periodic
elevations of ambient temperature.   However, heat stress-related mortality did
not occur with the 1:1 combination of up to 150 ppm each of narasin and
nicarbazin.  Mortality for the 80 &#43; 0, 50 &#43; 50, 62.5 &#43; 62.5 and 150 &#43; 150 ppm
(narasin &#43; nicarbazin) was similar to that of the control groups.  No clinical
signs of toxicity were observed although birds on 0 &#43; 125 and 250 &#43; 250 ppm
narasin &#43; nicarbazin were smaller than controls and birds from the other
treatment groups.   Changes in growth performance variables were considered to
be due to treatment-associated decreased feed consumption.   Adverse findings,
confined to the top two levels of 150 &#43; 150 and 250 &#43; 250 ppm narasin &#43;
nicarbazin, included decreased weight gain, reduced feed consumption
and  
 increased feed/gain ratio.   Lower weight gain and feed consumption also
occurred in the 0 &#43; 125 ppm narasin &#43; nicarbazin group.  There was a
treatment-related increase in the incidence and severity of congestive heart
failure, myocardial degeneration and skeletal muscle degeneration and
regeneration in birds given 150 &#43; 150 and 250 &#43; 250 ppm narasin &#43;
nicarbazin.  <p> 
 In conclusion, broiler chickens fed rations containing 1:1 combinations of
up to 250 ppm each of narasin and nicarbazin for seven weeks with a five-day
withdrawal from medication manifested adverse effects only to the top two
levels of 150 &#43; 150 and 250 &#43; 250 ppm narasin &#43; nicarbazin.  These included
growth depression, reduced feed efficiency, increased incidence of congestive
heart failure and other cardiac skeletal muscle alterations, and increased
mortality.  Heat stress-related mortality which occurred in birds given

 <b>VI.    HUMAN SAFETY</b>  <p> 
 Both narasin and nicarbazin are approved new animal drugs.  See
 Freedom of Information summaries for NADA 118-980 (51 FR 29098, August 14,
1986) and NADA 135-468 (50 FR 13562, April 5, 1985).  A tolerance for narasin
residues in chickens is not needed, 21 CFR 556.428.  The safe concentration for
total narasin residues in uncooked edible chicken tissues are 0.6 ppm in
muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver and 1.2 ppm in skin with adhering fat.  A tolerance of
4 parts per million is established for residues of nicarbazin in uncooked
chicken muscle, liver, and skin.  <p> 
 The following tissue residue study was conducted to evaluate drug decline
in target tissues from broiler chickens fed a ration containing 45.4 g/ton each
narasin and nicarbazin for eight weeks.  Muscle, liver and skin/fat tissue
samples were analyzed from chickens sacrificed after 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 days
withdrawal from medicated rations.  Narasin tissue residue levels ranged from
&lt;5.0 ppb in muscle and liver to 30.5 ppb in skin/fat at 0 day withdrawal.
No detectable residues of narasin in muscle, liver or skin/fat were found at 2
days withdrawal.  Nicarbazin tissue residue levels ranged from &lt;2.0 ppm in
muscle and skin/fat to 7.6 ppm in liver at 0 day withdrawal as shown in the
Summary Table.  No detectable residue of nicarbazin in muscle and skin/fat, and
&lt;2.0 ppm residue in liver were found at 2 days withdrawal.  <p> 
 This study demonstrated that residues of each drug in the combination
depleted below its safe concentration or tolerance by the proposed withdrawal
period of 5 days. <p>
  Assay interference data were obtained from normal tissues fortified
with each drug, with and without the presence of the second drug.  Two hundred
and fifty parts per billion (ppb) of narasin did not interfere with the assay
of nicarbazin in tissues and 4.15 parts per million (ppm) of nicarbazin did not
interfere with the assay of narasin in tissues.<p>

 <b>VII.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b>  <p> 
 The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that narasin and nicarbazin at
concentrations ranging from 27/27 g/ton to 45/45 g/ton of each in finished
feeds are safe and effective when fed to broiler chickens for the indications
stated on the product labeling.  <p> 
 A tolerance for narasin residues in chickens is not needed, 21 CFR 556.428.
The safe concentration for total narasin residues in uncooked edible chicken
tissues are 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver and 1.2 ppm in skin with
adhering fat.  A tolerance of 4 parts per million is established for residues
of nicarbazin in uncooked chicken muscle, liver, and skin.  The tissue residue
study submitted demonstrated that residues of each drug in combination depleted
below its safe concentration by the proposed withdrawal period of five (5)
days.  <p> 
 Adequate directions for use of Maxiban in broiler chickens has been written
for the requested claims of this NADA.  Products containing narasin and
nicarbazin alone are currently available over-the-counter, therefore the Agency
has concluded that approval of the combination (narasin and nicarbazin) will
not significantly increase human exposure to residues of Maxiban in edible
tissues. <p>

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-027;
generic nicarbazin), Planalquimica Industrial Ltda. is entitled to the approval
of generic nicarbazin in combination with roxarsone and lincomycin.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed).  Nicarbazin is codified under 21 CFR
&#167;558.366.  Lincomycin is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.325.
Roxarsone (3-Nitro&#174;) is codified under 21 CFR &#167;558.530.  The
combination of nicarbazin, lincomycin and roxarsone is codified under 21 CFR
&#167;558.325(c)(3)(xi) and &#167;558.366(c).<P>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><P>
<b>Tolerances for Marker Residues </b><P>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product.  <P>
A tolerance of 4.0 ppm is established for residues of nicarbazin in uncooked
chicken muscle, liver, skin, and kidney under 21 CFR &#167;556.445.<P>
Tolerances for total residues of arsenic (calculated as As) from roxarsone are
established for chicken tissues as 0.5 ppm in uncooked muscle and 2 ppm in
uncooked edible by-products under 21 CFR &#167;556.60.<P>
A tolerance for residues of lincomycin in chickens is not required under 21 CFR
&#167;556.360.<P>
<b>Withdrawal Time</b><P>
A 5-day withdrawal time is established for chickens receiving the
combination of nicarbazin, roxarsone, and lincomycin under 21 CFR
&#167;558.366.  A tissue residue depletion study submitted under ANADA
200-027 supports the use of the pioneer drug withdrawal time for the generic
nicarbazin product.<P>
<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><P>
The analytical method for the determination of roxarsone in tissues is a
spectrophotometric method.  The method is titled "Arsenic (Total) Residues in
Animal Tissues, Spectrophotometric Method," published in the 14th Edition of
<i>AOAC Official Methods of Analysis</i>, Method 41.009, page 777.<P>
The determinative procedure for quantifying nicarbazin residues in chicken
tissues is a liquid chromatographic assay with UV detection of
4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the marker residue for nicarbazin.  The identity
of DNC is confirmed by thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
The reference for the regulatory method is:  J.L. Lewis, T.D. Macy, and D.A.
Garteiz; <i>J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem.</i> <b>72</b>(4):  577-581.<P>
A regulatory method for residues of lincomycin in chicken tissues was not
required under NADA 034-085 because edible tissue residue levels were all below
the established safe concentration for total residues.<P>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of nicarbazin, lincomycin and roxarsone, when
used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its
labeled indications.<P>

<b>4.  Effectiveness:</b><p>
The New Animal Drug Application for milbemycin oxime tablets contains adequate
and well-controlled studies which demonstrate efficacy in preventing heartworm
disease and controlling hookworm infections in dogs.<p>
<b>A.  Dose Establishment</b><p>
Thirteen controlled studies were undertaken to establish and confirm the
optimal effective dose of milbemycin oxime against the tissue migratory phases
of <i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>&#160;(canine heartworm) and adult intestinal phases of
<i>Ancylostoma</i>&#160; sp., principally <i>A. caninum</i>&#160; (canine hookworm
disease).  These studies included 264 milbemycin oxime treated dogs and 107
placebo control dogs.  The milbemycin oxime 1&#37; powder formulation used in the
first 5 studies was determined to 
be bioequivalent to the final formulated tablet used in the remaining eight
studies (refer to Table 1 for additional information).<p>
The pleural cavity, cranial vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and
pulmonary arteries and branches in the lungs from each dog were examined for
worms at necropsy in each heartworm study.  The worms (<i>D. immitis </i>) form
each infected dog were counted, and sexed, and preserved in fixative.<p>
At necropsy in each hookworm study, the entire gastrointestinal tract was
removed form each dog.  The contents of the tract were removed, sieved, and
parasites recovered and identified.  The opened tracts were examined carefully
for remaining parasites which were recovered and identified.   Additionally,
the small intestine was incubated in saline for recovery of embedded parasites
which also were counted and identified.<p>
Total numbers of heartworms and hookworms found at necropsy were analyzed in
each study.  Percent efficacy was calculated using the formula:<p>
    

<pre>
 Mean Number of              Mean Number of
 Parasites             -     Parasites 
 in Control Animals          in Treated Animals   
-----------------------------------------------------  x 100  =  &#37; Efficacy
   Mean Number of Parasites in Control Animals    
    

</pre>

 The studies are identified in Table 1 and the results are summarized in Tables
2 and 3.<p>
These studies established the minimal effective dose for heartworm prevention
at 0.1 mg/kg, and for hookworm  control at 0.5 mg/kg. To support a dual claim
for heartworm prevention and hookworm control, the finished pharmaceutical
dosage forms (tablets) were formulated to provide a target dose of 0.5 mg/kg
body weight.  In target animal safety studies, the selected dose (0.5 mg/kg)
was determined to have a wide margin of safety.<p>
The heartworm and hookworm dose establishment studies summarized in the
following sections are identified in Table 1, and the results are detailed in
Tables 2 and 3.<ul><p>

<Li><b>6.  Non-Pivotal, Corroborative Hookworm (<i>A. caninum </i>) Dose
Establishment Study</b><p>
One non-pivotal, corroborative study, MH-147-0186 was conducted but is not

    <b>Investigators: </b><P>  Dr. I. Bekersky and H. Kramer <br>
                Madison, Wisconsin <p>
A bioequivalence study was conducted in dogs to demonstrate comparable
pharmacokinetic values following administration of a 1&#37; powder formulation
versus the commercial tablet dosage formulation.  This was deemed  
necessary because several of the early dose establishment studies utilized the
powder formulation.  The tablet used in this study was formulated to contain
5.68 mg of milbemycin oxime which provides a 0.5 mg/kg dose per animal.<p>
A classical two-way crossover design (eight dogs per group) was employed with a
30-day washout period between dosing.  Serum milbemycin oxime
concentration-time profiles were determined by a high-performance liquid
chromatographic assay.<p>
Statistical analysis (ANOVA) of the pharmacokinetic parameters tested indicated
no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in bioavailability between the two
pharmaceutical dosage forms.</ul></ul><p>
<b>B.  Well-Controlled Clinical Field Trial</b><p>
A multi-location, well-controlled clinical field trial employing essentially
identical study protocols was conducted during 1987-88.  The overall objective
was to evaluate the prevention of heartworm disease and control of hookworm
infection when used under typical veterinary practice condition.  The study
employed a total of 24 individual veterinary hospitals and clinics in the
following nine states:  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, North
Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Texas (Refer to Table 1 for
additional information).<p>
Patients were selected for inclusion in the study from animals presented to the
hospital or clinic for routine heartworm examination, physical examinations,
immunization, etc.  The patients were evaluated for their current heartworm
status and , if negative, assigned to either treatment group A (milbemycin
oxime) or treatment group X (Filaribits Plus, Norden), the reference drug.  The
treatment assignments were accomplished by following a computer-generated
randomization sequence.  Each investigator was provided a unique randomization
list or lists.<p>
Upon initiation into the study, each patient underwent a complete physical
examination including clinical pathology and fecal examination.  The study
duration for each dogs was 10 months. Patients were returned to the clinic for
follow-up evaluation according to the following schedule:<ul><p>
<Li>At 7-10 days post treatment, a parasitological (fecal) examination on all dogs
previously found to be positive for hookworm.<p>
<Li>At the end of the 2nd month, fecal flotation and circulating microfilariae
check.<p>
<Li>At the end of the 5th month, <i>D. immitis</i>&#160; adult antigen test, fecal flotation
and circulating microfilariae check.<p>
<Li>At the conclusion of the study (10 months), repeat <i>D. immitis</i>&#160; adult antigen
test, fecal flotation, circulating microfilariae check; complete physical
examination including blood chemistries and CBC.</ul><p>

Critical evaluation end-points were efficacy in preventing heartworm and
controlling hookworm, safety of the product as characterized by the
professional investigator and overall acceptability as perceived by the pet
owner.<p>
Milbemycin oxime was administered monthly in different sizes of tablets
(swallow) based on the weight of the dog.  The tablets were formulated to
provide a minimum monthly dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight.  Individual dogs
received 10 months of treatment. Over 65 different breeds or types of dogs
under a wide variety of circumstances participated in the trials.  Puppies as
young as 4 weeks old were included in the trials.<p>
As expected during this extended trial period, many dogs were exposed to a
variety of veterinary or animal health products including vaccines,
anesthetics, analgesics, anthelmintics, ectoparasiticides (including many flea
control  
products), antimicrobials, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, steroids, hormone,
and many ophthalmic and dermatologic preparations.  Both milbemycin oxime and
the control drug proved completely safe when used concurrently with these
medications.<p>
There were no investigator-documented adverse effects reported in either
treatment group during the course of the study.  Several comments were received
from owners, most concerning vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.  However,
upon examination by the investigator none of these responses could be
definitely attributed to either the test drug or reference treatment, but
rather to changes in diet, housing situations, or some underlying medical
problem.<p>
Seven hundred and sixty-nine (769) milbemycin treated dogs and 743 Filaribits
Plus treated dogs were enrolled in the clinical field trial.  At the completion
of the trial (month 10), 675 milbemycin oxime treated dogs and 658 Filaribits
Plus treated dogs were evaluated for efficacy and safety.  The remainder of the
dogs starting on trial were withdrawn by their owners for a wide variety of
reasons, most of which were unrelated to treatment. The most common reasons for
declining numbers of patients were the owner moving from the area, change of
ownership or death due to unrelated causes.<p>
Interim evaluation points were used to determine the effectiveness of
milbemycin oxime for hookworm removal.  Dogs with positive hookworm fecal
flotations within two weeks of treatment to document removal of adult
hookworms.<p>
Only two dogs, which had been identified as heartworm negative prior to the
start of the trials, had a heartworm positive indication at completion of the
trials.  One of the dogs, treated with Filaribits Plus (Norden), was documented
as owner non-compliance in giving the medication.  The other dog, treated with
milbemycin oxime, was documented as an occult infected dog inadvertently
admitted to the study.  Milbemycin oxime was highly effective in controlling
hookworm infections during the clinical studies.  Twenty-one percent of the
dogs receiving milbemycin in oxime were diagnosed with hookworm infections at
some point during the study.  By the end of the study period, 97.5&#37; of these
dogs were negative on fecal examination.  (Refer to Table 3 for additional
information.)<p>
<b>Conclusions</b><p>
Based upon data generated in laboratory studies in over 260 dogs and clinical
field trial in well over 600 dogs, it is concluded that milbemycin oxime,
administered in a tablet formulation at the recommended dose, is effective at
preventing heartworm disease and controlling adult hookworm infections in
dogs.<p>
<b>5.  Animal Safety:  </b><p>
<b>Summary</b><p>
Five target animal safety studies were conducted in dogs to address the
tolerance and safety of milbemycin oxime.  Studies were specifically designed
to evaluate safety of the drug administered at exaggerated doses in breeding
animals, in  a long-term (10-month duration) study, in weanling puppies and in
dogs with patent heartworm infection.  All studies were conducted with the
final commercial tablet formulation.<p>
These studies clearly demonstrated that milbemycin oxime tablets provide a wide
therapeutic index when administered orally to dogs at the recommended dose of
0.5 mg/kg body weight, monthly.  The chronic studies provided evidence that
dogs tolerate up to five times the use rate administered on three consecutive
days each month while the reproduction study demonstrated no adverse effects in
the pregnant bitch or her offspring following daily administration of the drug
at three times its monthly use rate throughout pregnancy.  A mild, transient
shock-like reaction was observed when milbemycin oxime was administered to
certain heartworm-infected dogs with high microfilaremic counts.<p>

<Li><b>(c)  General Design:</b><p>
The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of milbemycin oxime on
reproduction in the dog.  Gonadal function, estrus cycle, mating behavior,
conception, length of gestation, parturition, lactation, weaning, viability,
growth, and development of the offspring were measured parameters.
Additionally, the incidence of any malformations in young puppies was
determined by external examinations and examination of skeletal radiographs.<p>
Intended use regiment for milbemycin oxime is once monthly. Preliminary studies
indicated that milbemycin oxime accumulates in the mild of lactating bitches
following daily dosing.  Since nursing pups would then receive an extremely
high amout based on their body weight, the study was divided into two phases.
In the reproduction phase, studs were dosed daily for a minimum of 90 days
through the end of mating and bitches were dosed daily through mating and until
one week period to whelping.  In the pup safety evaluation phase, untreated
pregnant bitches were dosed once either before, on the day of, or shortly after
whelping in order to simulate the real-life monthly dosing situation.  In both
phases, milbemycin oxime was administered at three times the intended use
rate.<ul><p>
<Li><b>animals:</b><p>
Purebred beagle dogs.<P>  Twenty adult males and 20 adult females, reproduction
phase; 25 pregnant females, pup safety evaluation phase.<p>  All animals were a
minimum of two years of age and bitches had whelped at least two litters.<p>
<li><b>test materials:</b><p>  Placebo tablets were formulated identically to the test
tablets but without the inclusion of active ingredient.<P>  Milbemycin oxime
tablets were formulated to deliver orally 5.68 mg per tablet.<p>
<li><b>dosage: </b> 0 (placebo), 1.5 mg/kg body weight/day.<p>
<li><b>route of administration: </b> Orally by tablet<p>
<li><b>test duration: </b> <p>
From three months prior to breeding of the parental generation to weaning of
the F1 generation; the total time of the study was approximately nine
months.<p>
<li><b>pertinent parameters measured: </b> <p>
General observations were survival, appearance and behavior, body weight, food
consumption, sperm evaluation (P0).<p>
Reproduction and litter observations were stud and bitch fertility indices,
mean gestation length, pup viability, pup growth , pup survivability, pup
malformations.</ul><p>
<Li><b>(d)  Results:</b><ul><p>
<li><b>clinical observations:</b><P>  No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in the P0
and F1 generation animals.  Survival was 100&#37; for all parental animals. No
treatment-related body weight effects were observed; no consistent food
consumption variances occurred to indicated compound-related effects.<p>
<li><b>sperm evaluation:</b><P>  The values of the treated group for semen volume, sperm
count, percent progressive motility, speed of progression, pH, and sperm
morphology and color were not different from the control group values.<p>
<li><b>reproduction parameters:</b><P>  Treatment with milbemycin oxime had no deleterious
effects on reproduction parameters.  Stud and bitch fertility indices and mean
gestation length for the treated group were not different form the control
values.<p>
<li><b>pup viability:</b><p>
Mean numbers of live and dead pups at birth in the treated group were
comparable to the control group values.  Pup survival indices throughout
lactation did not indicate any adverse treatment effects on offspring
viability.  Gestation  
and weaning indices and sex distribution of pups during lactation for the
treated group were not different form the control values.<p>
<li><b>pup growth:</b><p>
Treatment of parental animals with milbemycin oxime did not adversely affect
growth of their offspring.  Mean pup body weight values for female pups form
the treated group were less than the control values on several occasions during
lactation (days 4, 7, and 42).  However, the mean pup body weight values for
the treated group were comparable to or greater than historical control values
for that colony.<p>
<li><b>pup malformations:</b><p>
External evaluation, necropsy of dead animals, and radiographs of live pups
from control and treated groups revealed no evidence of treatment-related
malformations. </ul><p>
<Li><b>(e)  Conclusions:</b><p>
Beagle studs and bitches were treated daily with milbemycin oxime at 3X the
monthly use level or a placebo throughout a premating and mating period and in
bitches until one week prior to whelping in the reproduction phase of this
study.  Untreated pregnant beagle bitches were treated once with 3X the monthly
use level of milbemycin oxime on or about day 4 prior to whelping, day 1 prior
to whelping, whelping day, and days 1 and 2 post-whelping in the pup safety
evaluation phase.  Bitches in both phases were allowed to deliver and nurse
their pups through day 42 of lactation.  Body weight, food intake, semen
quality, reproduction parameters,and pup viability and growth were
evaluated.<p>
Milbemycin oxime had no effect on any of the reproduction or litter parameters
measured.  Data were similar in all groups to concurrent controls, to
historical control data, and to data collected during this study period from
the production colony.</ul><p>

Oxime (CGA-179246), International Research and Development Corporation,
Mattawan, Michigan, Study No. 382-122.</b><ul><p>
<li><b>(a)  Type of study:</b><p>
This was a chronic study (10 months) during which the drug was administered in
tablet form at 0, 1X, 3X, or 5X the monthly use rate of 0.5 mg/kg body weight
daily for three consecutive days each month.<p>

            Development Corporation<br>
            Mattawan, Michigan<p>
<li><b>(c)  General Design:</b><p>
The objective of the study was to evaluate any chronic toxicity effects of
milbemycin oxime in the dog.  Observations were made for signs of overt
toxicity, morbidity or mortality; body weight changes; food consumption;
ophthalmologic examination; hematological, biochemical, and urinalysis
determination; and macroscopic and microscopic examination of tissues.<p>
The intended use regimen of milbemycin oxime is once monthly.  Animals were
dosed monthly at 1X, 3X,and 5X the recommended use rate (0.5 mg/kg body
weight).  However, doses were given daily over three consecutive days each
month for a total of ten months.<ul><p>
<li><b>animals:  </b><p>
Purebred beagle dogs.<p>  Thirty-two males and 32 females.<p>  All animals were
approximately eight weeks of age at initiation.<p>
<li><b>control: </b> <p>
A placebo tablet identical to the active tablet but without the inclusion of
active ingredient.<p>
<li><b>dosage form: </b><p> Milbemycin oxime tablets formulated to deliver orally 5.68
mg per tablet.<p>
<li><b>dosage:</b><P>  By protocol design, technicians dosed the animals without knowledge of
which groups were treated.  Because of the blinding requirement, all animals
received the same number of tablets on each dosing day.<p>
<li><b>route of administration: </b> Orally by tablet<p>
<li><b>test duration: </b><p> Ten months on study, starting with eight week-old
puppies.<p>
<li><b>pertinent parameters measured:</b>  <p>
Clinical observations, hematologic and serum chemistry measurements, body
weight changes, organ weights, and macroscopic and microscopic tissue
evaluations were used to assess any potential effects in the dogs.</ul><p>
<li><b>(d)  Results:</b><ul><p>
<li><b>clinical observations:</b><p>  All criteria observed at the 1x rate were similar to
the control animals.  At the 3X rate (dosed daily for three consecutive days) a
few dogs exhibited slight to mild transient trembling and/or ataxia during the
first three days of the study; no signs were observed during the remainder of
the study.  At the 5X rate (dosed daily for three consecutive days), transient
trembling and/or ataxia was observed in most of the dogs during the first three
days of the study; no signs were observed during the remainder of the study.<p>
These ataxia and/or trembling findings were considered a consequence of
over-dosage for these young puppies.  The dosage had been calculated for adult
dogs weighing 11 to 25 lbs., whereas these dogs at study initiation weighed an
average of 4 lbs. Therefore, these dogs received a 2.5-5X increase in dosage
over the targeted doses of 1X, 3X and 5X the recommended use rate. Side-effects
were not seen at any subsequent dosing period.  A further study, summarized in
this document, more clearly defines the effect of milbemycin oxime in dogs aged
eight to twelve weeks.<p>
One control male and one female dosed at the 5X use rate died on day 3 and one
male receiving the 1X use rate died on day 38. These deaths were considered
unrelated to administration of the test article because of the absence of
clinical findings or any dose-response relationship.<p>
<li><b>laboratory findings: </b><p> No treatment-related effects were observed in any of the
parameters for hematology, clinical chemistry, body weight, organ weight or
pathology.</ul><p>
<li><b>(e)  Conclusions:</b><p>
No serious drug-related effects were detected following monthly use rate, given
daily for three consecutive days.  A mild transient ataxia and/or trembling
reaction was observed in eight-week-old puppies at rates in excess of 3X and 5X
the normal dose. At all subsequent monthly dosings in 12-week and older dogs,
neither these nor any other overt signs developed.  All parameters including
gross and microscopic tissue changes confirmed the absence of compound-related
signs of toxicity.</ul><p>

<li><b>pertinent parameters measured:</b><p>
Clinical observations,  mortality, and body weight.</ul><p>
<li><b>(d)  Results:</b><ul><p>
<li><b>clinical observations:</b> <p>  Treated animals exhibited transient clinical signs
including ataxia, trembling, prostration, and ptyalism.  None of these signs
were seen after day 6.  These effects, especially ataxia and trembling, were
dose-related at all ages.  Prostration was seen in five of 12 animals at 25X
and only one of 12 animals at 15X. Ptyalism was seen in four of 12 animals at
25X and only one of 12 animals at 15X.  The severity of the ataxia and
trembling was greatest at 25X, especially in eight-week- and ten-week-old
animals.  Onset of trembling and/or ataxia was noted on the second day of
dosing and was generally observed for one or two additional days longer in
ten-week-old animals at 25X.  Animals were notably affected at 15X especially
eight-week- and ten-week-old females, though less severely than at 25X.  The
effects were slight and sporadic at 5X; six of the 12 5X animals exhibited no
ataxia or trembling.  There were no effects seen at 1X.<p>
These effects showed a slight age-related occurrence.  Twelve-week-old males
and females were less affected than eight-week or ten-week-old males and
females at 25X.  At 15X, 12-week-old females were less affected than eight-week
or ten-week-old females; 12 week-old males were similar to eight-week-or
ten-week-old males.<p>
<li><b>mortality and body weights: </b><p> No effects were noted in these
parameters.</ul><p>
<li><b>(e)  Statistical analysis: </b><p> Descriptive statistics were calculated where
appropriate.<p>
<li><b>(f)  Conclusions:</b><p>
Treatment-related clinical signs, especially ataxia and trembling, were the
only effects noted for the parameters measured.  These effects were
dose-related at all ages.  The incidence, severity, and length of occurrence
were greatest at 25X, less at 15X, and very slight at 5X.  Six of 12 animals at
5X showed no trembling or ataxia.  The effects were also slightly age-related;
12-week-old males and females were less affected than eight-week- or
ten-week-old animals at 25X and 12-week-old females were less affected than
eight-week or ten-week-old females at 15X.  There were no effects seen at
1X.<p>
The recommended dosage regime requires administration of milbemycin oxime at
the rate of 0.5 mg/kg once every 30 days (or calendar month).<p>
Since no effects were noted at 1X and only minor effects noted at 5X in puppies
dosed at these rates for three consecutive days, a wide margin of safety exists
for use of this product in young dogs.</ul><p>

<li><b>test duration:</b>  <p>
Animals were dosed once a month for three consecutive months.  The animals were
observed for approximately a two-week period following the last monthly
administration.<p>
<li><b>pertinent parameters measured: </b> <p>
Clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, hematology (at 3 and 24 hours
after each dosing), clinical chemistry, urinalysis, gross pathology,
microfilarial counts, and estimation of adult heartworms (at necropsy).</ul><p>
<li><b>(d)  Results: </b><ul><p>
<li><b>clinical observations: </b> <p>
Within hours following the initial dosing, several treated animals exhibited
varying degrees of reaction including labored respiration, abdominal breathing,
pale mucous membranes, vomiting, and lethargy.  However, these signs had
disappeared in all animals by the end of the second day after dosing.<p>
Following the second and third monthly dosing, fewer animals exhibited side
effects which were also less severe and equally transient.<p>
<li><b>body weights, food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, ophthalmology,
and urinalysis:</b><p>  No treatment related effects were observed for any of these
parameters.<p>
<li><b>microfilaria:</b><p>   Microfilarial counts decreased markedly in both treated groups
within 24 hours after Dose 1.  After Doses 2 and 3, little further change in
microfilarial count scores occurred.<p>
<li><b>gross necropsy and heartworm count: </b><p>  None of the lesions found during gross
necropsy were considered to be related to treatment with milbemycin oxime.
Adult heartworms were found in the hearts and associated vessels of all animals
in the study in numbers ranging from 3 worms to over 120 worms.  Most animals
had no gross lesions other than those associated with the infestation of
heartworms.</ul><p>
<li><b>(e)  Statistical analysis: </b><p>
 Because the test animals were of mixed breed, varying ages and sizes and of
unknown history and health (heartworm-infested), only descriptive statistics
(means, etc.) were calculated where appropriate.<p>
<li><b>(f)  Conclusions:</b><p>
Administration of milbemycin oxime to heartworm-infected mixed breed dogs at 1
or 3 times the use rate once each month for 3 consecutive months resulted in
minor clinical signs in several dogs after the initial dose.  Symptoms were 
transient and of generally slight to moderate severity including abdominal
respiration, pale mucous membranes, and decreased activity. Clinical signs were
rare and even less severe after Doses 2 and 3. These clinical signs were
thought to be the result of the microfilariacidal effects of milbemycin oxime.
There were no other side-effects seen in milbemycin oxime-treated dogs
throughout the study.<p>
A decrease in the numbers of circulating mirofilaria was seen in dogs at both
dose levels after each administration when compared to baseline values and to
control values.</ul><p>

at both dose levels when compared to initial values and to control values.</ul><p>
<b>B.  Corroborative Studies</b><p>
Preliminary, non-pivotal animals safety studies were conducted to evaluate the
potential toxicity of milbemycin oxime and to develop range-finding data in
support of pivotal animal safety study protocol development.<p>
<b>1.  Pilot Limit Test in Dogs</b><p>
Milbemycin oxime technical in a powdered formulation was administered orally
via gelatin capsules to 2 male and 2 female beagle dogs at a dose of 200 mg/kg.
All dogs were observed for 14 days following dosing.  Clinical signs observed
in all animals included apparent compound in the feces, emesis with apparent
compound, inappetence, and few or no feces.  The onset of these signs occurred
by 2 hours post dose and all animals appeared normal by test day 4.  All
animals exhibited a body weight gain by test day 15.  Hematology and clinical 
chemistry evaluations performed on all animals on test day 15  were unremarkable.  
Based
on these data and standard evaluation criteria, a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg
of milbemycin was well-tolerated by beagle dogs and is considered to have, at
most, a lower order of acute oral toxicity in the dog.<p>
<b>2.  Pilot Oral Rising-Dose Tolerance Study</b><p>
Milbemycin oxime technical powder was administered orally to one male and one
female beagle dog at successively increasing doses of 2, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg, at
7-day intervals for 4 consecutive weeks. General observations, body weight,
food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and physical
examinations were performed on both animals.  All doses were well-tolerated and
no adverse clinical effects observed.<p>
<b>3.  Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs</b><p>
Milbemycin oxime technical in a powder formulation was administered orally by
capsule to two beagle dogs each at dosage levels of 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg/day for
36 consecutive days.  Control dogs received empty gelatin capsules.<p>
The results demonstrated that all animals survived the six-week study, all
criteria examined for the treated groups were considered to be comparable to
findings in the control group, and no toxicity related to the administration of
the test article was observed in dogs at doses tested; approximately 3X and 5X
the use rate.<p>
<b>4.  Pregnant Dog Studies</b><p>
In one study three "proven" purebred beagle bitches each received 1.5 mg/kg
(three times the recommended use rate) beginning on the day of the first
observed "mating tie" and daily thereafter until weaning.<p>
In a separate evaluation, five "proven," pregnant, purebred beagle bitches
scheduled to whelp in two weeks received 1.5 mg/kg per day for days 1-12 and
approximately 0.75 mg/kg through the remaining dosing period.  Each bitch was
dosed beginning approximately two weeks prior to whelping and continuing
through one week post-whelping.<p>
The bitches from both studies gained weight, remained healthy and did not
exhibit any clinical signs of toxicity.  Some puppies nursing these bitches
exhibited possible compound-related effects. These effects were attributed to
the exaggerated dosing regimens used; up to three times the recommended dose
administered daily instead of monthly.<p>
<b>5.  Determination of Milbemycin Oxime Residues in the Colostrum of
Dogs</b><p>
Analysis of milk samples from the nursing bitches described in the Pregnant Dog
Studies determined the presence of milbemycin oxime at levels varying from 0.26
to 0.54 ppm.<p>
<b>6.  Young Puppy Study</b><p>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the direct effect of exaggerated
doses of milbemycin oxime given to newborn (day of birth) puppies.<p>
A total of 50 one-day-old purebred beagle puppies from 10 different litters
were included in this study.  Thirty puppies were dosed with milbemycin oxime
at 0.5 ppm, 15 received water only.<p>
Each of the puppies received the allotted test material, suspended in water.
All of the animals were dosed on their day of birth (Day 1) by gavage and for a
total of six consecutive days.  The amount of fluid dispensed was approximately
that obtained one nursing period.<p>
One of 30 puppies receiving 0.5 ppm and four of 15 puppies receiving 1.0 ppm
died from possible compound-related effects attributed to exaggerated dosing.
One of five control puppies died from placebo dosing-related complications.<p>
<b>7.  Effects of Treatment of Adult Collies with Milbemycin Oxime</b><p>
The objective of this study was to determine if observable adverse reactions
occur following treatment of adult collies with milbemycin oxime at dosages of
0.5 (recommended dose) and 2.5 mg/kg body weight (five times the recommended
dose).<p>
Ten adult collies (five males and five females) were assigned to one of two
treatment groups:  Group I dogs received a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight and
Group II dogs received a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight.  Each dog was treated
twice, one week apart. The study was repeated in cross-over fashion; in this
case, dogs having received milbemycin oxime at 0.5 mg/kg body weight were
treated at 2.5 mg/kg body weight and those treated at 2.5 mg/kg were treated at
0.5 mg/kg body weight.  Each dog received two treatments, one week apart.<p>
For a period of 8 hours following treatment, dogs were observed at 30-minute
and one-hour intervals for adverse reactions to or side-effects resulting from
administration of milbemycin oxime.<p>
All collies appeared normal after treatment with milbemycin oxime at both
dosages.  No apparent adverse reactions or side-effects were observed.<p>
<b>8.  Oral Rising-Dose Toxicity Study in Collies</b><p>
The purpose of this study was to determine whether observable adverse effects
occur following treatment with milbemycin oxime at rising dosages of 2.5 mg/kg
(5X the recommended dose), 5.0 mg/kg (10X), 10 mg/kg (20X) and 12.5 mg/kg (25X)
in collie dogs.<p>
Fourteen collie dogs (8 males, 6 females) ages one to seven years were treated
with milbemycin oxime technical powder according to the following regime:<p>

Dogs were observed hourly for eight hours post-treatment for any adverse
reactions to or side-effects resulting from milbemycin oxime administration.
Blood for hematology and serum chemistry evaluation was drawn from all 
animals three hours post-treatment. Prior to treatment, parasitologic
examinations revealed the presence of various nematodes and/or acarines in
eleven of fourteen dogs.<p>
Treatment of collie dogs with milbemycin oxime at 2.5 mg/kg (5X), 5.0 mg/kg
(10X) and 10.0 mg/kg (20X) did not result in demonstrable toxic reactions.
Results of hematology and serum chemistries from blood drawn three hours
following each treatment revealed no obvious abnormal trends.<p>
Treatment with milbemycin oxime at 12.5 mg/kg (25X) resulted in an adverse
reaction in one collie.  The animal was markedly ataxic, pyrexic and
demonstrated periodic recumbency.  Results of hematology and serum chemistry
evaluation revealed elevated blood glucose which was attributed to stress from
the adverse reaction. The animal was euthanized due to the likelihood of an
unacceptably long period of convalescence.  On post-mortem examination, this
dog was found to be parasitized with adult <i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>.
Histopathologic examination demonstrated changes consistent with canine
heartworm disease.  No other adverse reactions were observed in animals
following treatment with milbemycin oxime at 12.5 mg/kg (25X).<p>
  
<b>Summary</b><p>
In summary, the corroborative safety studies demonstrated safety in adult dogs,
including collies.  Additional studies in pregnant dogs provided evidence that
milbemycin oxime is safe for pregnant dogs.  Puppies nursing females which
received exaggerated dosing regimens (up to three times the recommended dose
given daily instead of monthly), demonstrated compound related effects.  These
effects were directly attributable  to the exaggerated dosing regimen.
Subsequent pivotal safety studies using exaggerated, but less severe, dosing
regimens demonstrated safety to pregnant  
females and puppies<p>
 <b>6.  Human Safety:</b><p>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:  </b><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  This drug is to be labeled for use in
dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><p>
Labeling contains adequate caution statement.<p>
Labeling states:  "Keep out of reach of children."<p>

<b>7.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
The data demonstrated that Interceptor (milbemycin oxime) Tablets when used
under the labeled conditions of use is safe and effective.<p>
Under Section 512 (c)(2)(F)(i) of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988, this New Animal Drug Application qualifies for five
years of marketing exclusivity because milbemycin oxime is a new drug that has
never been previously approved under Section 512 (b)(1) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act.<p>
The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian
because professional expertise is required to determine the existence of
heartworm and/or hookworm infection, and to then properly treat existing
heartworm infection prior to starting treatment with Interceptor (milbemycin
oxime)  Tablets in a prevention program, and for the control of hookworm
infection.<p>

Dear Dr. Eppley:<p>
We refer to your letter dated October 17, 1989, regarding a generic copy of

horses.<p>
You requested a waiver from <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing and submitted
information on the components and composition of your proposed product.<P>
Based on the information you provided, your proposed product is a solution
containing the same active and inactive ingredients as the pioneer product.  It
is intended solely for intravenous and intramuscular injection.  It is,
therefore, eligible for waiver from <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing
under our current policy.<P>
Your Request for Waiver is granted.  It is granted, however, on the condition
that the full information presented in your Abbreviated New Animal Drug
Application continues to show that your proposed generic product is 
chemically equivalent to the pioneer product.  If it is not, <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing
could be required.<p>
In submitting your ANADA, please refer to the number at the top of this letter
and include a copy of this correspondence in your original submission.<P>
Sincerely,<p>

<b>Route of Administration: </b><p>Intravenous injection is preferred.
Intracardiac injection      may be made when intravenous injection is
impractical, as in      a very small dog, or in a comatose dog with impaired
vascular    functions. Good injection skill is necessary for intracardiac  
injection. The calculated dose should be given in a single bolus    injection.
For intravenous injection, a needle of sufficient   gauge to insure
intravenous placement of the entire dose should     be used.<p>
<b>Species:           </b>Canine<p>

<b>Date of Summary:  </b>  February 24, 1994<p>
<b>2. Target Animal Safety and Drug Effectiveness:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act., as amended
by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460,
December
15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product). New target animal safety data and drug
effectiveness data were not required for approval of this ANADA. This ANADA
relies on the target animal safety and drug effectiveness data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.<p>
For certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an
<i>in vivo</i>&#160; </i>bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; 
Fifth GADPTRA
Policy Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990). Based upon the
formulation characteristics of the generic product, Delmarva Laboratories, Inc.
was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; </i>bioequivalence 
study for
Euthasol(TM). The generic and pioneer products are intravenous
solutions with the same active and inactive ingredients. The generic and
pioneer products also contain the same concentration of active ingredients.
This ANADA was granted a waiver February 19, 1991 (see section 4).<p>
<b>3. Human Safety:</b><ul><p>
<li>a. Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this ANADA. The drug is to be labeled for use
in dogs, which are non-food animals.<p>
<li>b. Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling, and Administration:<p>
Caution should be exercised to avoid contact of the drug with open wounds or
accidental self-inflicted injections. Keep out of reach of children.
Appropriate cautionary statements are clearly documented on labeling.<p>
Euthasol(TM) (pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium) is a Schedule III
controlled drug and has a "C III" symbol prominently displayed on all labeling

Charles H. Tracy, D.V.M.<br>
Delmarva Laboratories, Inc.<br>
P. O. Box 525<br>
Midlothian, Virginia 23113<p>
Dear Dr. Tracy:<p>
We refer to your submission dated October 26, 1990 requesting an Investigational
New Animal Drug (INAD) exemption for a generic copy of Schering
Corporation's Beuthanasia-D Special (pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium,
NADA 119-807).  The proposed product is a euthanasia solution for use in dogs.
You requested a waiver of the requirement for an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; 
bioequivalence study to support the filing of an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application
 (ANADA) based on the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration
 Act (GADPTRA) of 1988.<p>
 Based on the information you provided, your proposed product is a solution 
 containing the same active and inactive ingredients in the same concentration
 as the approved pioneer product.  It is, therefore, eligible for a waiver
 from <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing under our current policy.<p>
 Your request for a waiver is granted on the condition that the full information
 presented in your ANADA  shows that your proposed generic product is
 equivalent to the pioneer product.  This includes the declared/actual pH
 range of your proposed generic product.  If it is not shown to be equivalent,
 <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing could be required.<p>
 
 Granting of this waiver does not assure approval of your ANADA.  All necessary requirements 
 must be fulfilled, including certification that your product or its proposed uses
 do not violate or infringe upon any patent or 
 exclusivity for the pioneer product or its uses.<p>
 For administrative purposes, we have assigned number 6957 to your Investigational
 New Animal Drug (INAD) exemption for the above referenced use of
 pentobarbital sodium/phenytoin soduim solution.  Future correspondence to 
 your INAD file regarding this submission should be identified by the date of
 this letter and our file number INAD 6957-A000.<p>
 In submitting your ANADA, please refer to this number and include a copy of
 this correspondence in your original submission.<p>
 Should  you have questions or need further assistance, please contact Dr.
 Marcia K. Larkins, Chief for Companion &amp; Wildlife Drugs Branch.  The
 telephone number is (301) 443-3430.<p>

<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
 Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the
Agency grants a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalence study
(55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of
bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are
based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product. <p>
    Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Phoenix
Scientific, Inc. was granted a waiver April 15, 1992 (see Section 4) from
conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160;  bioequivalence study with Phenylbutazone 20%
Injection.  The generic and pioneer products are solutions with the same
concentrations of active and inactive ingredients. <br>
   <br>
<b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>

 INAD 8350 (C001)<P>
 James H. Schafer, D.V.M.<br>
 Consultant to the Veterinary<br>
 Pharmaceutical Industry<br>
 Ft. Collins, CO  80524<p>
 Dear Dr. Schafer:<p>
 We refer to your submission dated March 3, 1992, to the Investigational New Animal
 Drug (INAD) file on the behalf of Phonix Pharmaceutical, Inc. for a generic copy of 
 Coopers Animal Health Incorporated's Butazolidin (phenylbutazone, 200 mg/mL, NADA
 011-575).  The product is proposed for relief of inflammatory conditions associated
 with the musculoskeletal system in dogs and horses.  You requested a waiver of the 
 requirement for an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study to support the filing of
 an Abbrevieated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) based on the Generic Animal Drug and
 Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTRA) of 1988.<p>
 Based on the information you provided, your proposed product contains the same active
 and inactive ingredients in the same concentrations as the approved pioneer product.  The
 pH of your product conforms to that of the pioneer, and the route of administration is the
 same.  It is, therefore, eligible for a waiver from <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence
 testing under our current policy.<p>
 Your request for a waiver is granted on the condition that the full information presented
 in your ANADA continues to show that your proposed generic product is chemically
 equivalent to the pioneer product.  If it is not shown to be chemically equivalent,
 <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing could be required.<p>
 Granting of this waiver does not assure approval of you ANADA.  All necessary
 requirements must be fulfilled, including certification that your product or its proposed
 uses do not violate or infringe upon any patent or exclusivity for the pioneer product or
 its uses.<p>
 Future correspondence to your INAD file regarding this submission should be identified by the 
 date of this letter and our file number, INAD 8350-C001.<p>
 In submitting your ANADA, please refer to this number and include a copy of this
 correspondence in your original submission.<p>
  <b>Environmental Considerations:</b><p>
  Your request for a waiver of the bioequivalency test was reviewed under the National 
  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Since no investigation is planned under your INAD,
  no wastes are expected to enter the environment.  Therefore, we have determined that
  this action qualifies for a categorical exclusion from the requirement to prepare an
  environmental assessment (EA) under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(4).  If studies are planned to be 
  conducted under this INAD, please file either a claim for an exclusion or submit and 
  EA.<p>
  All ANADAs require an abbbreviated EA.  Guidance is available on the preparation of the EA
  in the Center's second generic animal drug policy letter dated June 7, 1989.
  The letter contains an example format for preparing an EA for submission tothe ANADA.<p>
  Should you have questions or need further assistance, please contact Dr. Sandra K.
  Woods, Chief of Equine &#38; antimicrobial Drugs Branch.  The telephone number is (301)
  295-8617.<p>
  Sincerely yours,<P>

<b>5.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
     
    This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under Section
512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <p>
Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug,  Phenylbutazone 20%
Injection (200 mg/mL), were established by demonstration of chemical
equivalence to the pioneer product, Cooper's Butazolidin&#174; Injectable, 20%
(NADA 011-575).<p>
This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for the 100 mL vial for use in horses.  The route and method of
administration of the two drugs are identical.  Both drugs are administered
intravenously.  The generic and pioneer products contain the same active and
inactive ingredients.  Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy promulgated to
implement Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety,
efficacy, or <i>in vivo  </i>&#160;bioequivalency studies were necessary or
required.<p>
The pioneer package insert includes recommendations for the drug's use in
horses and dogs.  The generic product is labeled for use in horses only.  Under
NADA #011-575, the pioneer equine only injectable product is packaged in 100 mL
vials.  These vials are labeled for use in horses only because the Center for
Veterinary Medicine's "Points to Consider in Determining Vial Size for
Veterinary Parenteral Products" (1986) indicates that the 100 mL vial for
phenylbutazone would not be suitable for use in dogs due to the large number of
potential needle punctures in the vial stopper, and resulting
stability/sterility concerns.  The pioneer also manufactured 25 and 50 mL size
vials labeled for horses and dogs (vial sizes suitable for both species).  Both
species shared the same package insert.<p>
The generic product copies only the 100 mL vial size.  Therefore, it can only
be labeled for use in horses due to the regulatory decision concerning vial
size and sterility issues. <p>
Injectable phenylbutazone has been designated by the Center for Veterinary
Medicine as a medically necessary medical drug product.  A product shortage
currently exists for the injectable formulation.<p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Phenylbutazone 20% Injection, is safe and effective for its
labeled indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

                    1420 Minnesota Ave.<br>
                    Billings, Montana 59101<p>
<b>Generic Name: </b>       Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate) combined with
Sulfamethazine<p>
   
<b>Trade Names:</b>           Tylan 5, 10, 20 &amp; 40 Sulfa-G<p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  June 3, 1986<p>
<b>II. Indications For Use:</b><p>
For maintaining weight gains and feed efficiency in the presence of atrophic
rhinitis; lowering the incidence and severity of <i>Bordetella bronchiseptica</i>&#160;
rhinitis; prevention of swine dysentery (vibrionic); control of swine pneumonia
caused by bacterial pathogens (<i>Pasteurella multocida</i>&#160; and/or <i>Corynebacterium
pyogenes </i>).<p>
Feeds containing Tylosin and Sulfamethazine must be withdrawn 15 days before
swine are slaughtered.<p>
<b>III. Dosage Form:</b>  Medicated Premix<p>
The premix is to be added to the feed such that the complete feed contains 100
grams of tylosin and 100 grams of sulfamethazine per ton.<p>
<b>IV. Summary of Safety and Efficacy:</b><p>
The safety and efficacy data upon which this application was approved are found
in NADAs 12-491 and 41-275 for Elanco Products Company, and are summarized in
an FOI Summary filed with the Dockets Management Branch under the generic name
of the drugs.<p>
<b>V. Agency Conclusion:</b><p>
Approval of this application is based on safety and effectiveness data
contained in Elanco Products Company's approved NADAs 12-491 and 41-275.  Use
of the data in NADAs 12-491 and 41-275 to support this application has been
authorized by Elanco.  This approval does not change the approved use of the
drug.  Consequently, approval of this NADA poses no increased human risk from
exposure to residues of the animal drug, nor does it change the conditions of
the drug's safe use in the target animal species.  Accordingly, under the
Center for Veterinary Medicine's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367),
this is equivalent to a Category II supplemental approval, which does not
require reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the original
application.<p>

Summary</b><P>
<b>I. GENERAL INFORMATION</b><P>
<b> NADA Number:</b>        140-442<P>
 <b>NADA Sponsor:</b><p>            Med-Tech, Inc.<br>
                    7410 NW Tiffany Springs Parkway, Suite 260<br>
                    Kansas City, Missouri 64153<P>
 <b>Generic Name:</b>       Xylaxine HCl<P>
 <b>Trade Name:</b>         Xylazine HCl Injection<P>
<b> Marketing Status:</b>   Rx<P>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  February 18, 1988<p>
<b>II. INDICATIONS FOR USE</b><P>
Xylazine HCl Injection should be used in horses when it is desirable to produce
a state of sedation.  It has been successfully used when conducting various
diagnostic, orthopedic and dental procedures and for minor surgical procedures
of short duration.  It may also be used as a preanesthetic to local or general
anesthesia.<P>
<b>III. DOSAGE </b><P>
 For intravenous or intramuscular administration in
horses.<P>
   The recommended dosage for intravenous administration is
0.5 ml/100 lbs body weight (0.5 mg/lb).  The recommended dosage for
intramuscular administration is 1.0 ml/100 lbs body weight (1.0 mg/lb).<P>
Following administration of Xylazine HCl Injection, the animal should be
allowed to rest quietly until the full effect has been reached.  These dosages
produce a state of sedation which is usually maintained for 1 to 2
hours.<P>
PREANESTHETIC TO LOCAL ANESTHESIA -  At the recommended dosage rates, Xylazine
HCl Injection may be used in conjunction with local anesthetics, such as
procaine and lidocaine.<P>
PREANESTHETIC TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA -  At the recommended dosage rates, Xylazine
HCl Injection produces an additive effect to central nervous system
depressants, such as sodium pentobarbital, sodium thiopental and sodium
thiamylal.  Accordingly, the dosage of such compounds should be reduced and
administration to the desired effect.  Generally, 1/3 to 1/2 of the calculated
dosage of the barbiturates will be needed to produce a surgical plane of
anesthesia.  Postanesthetic or emergence excitement has not been observed in
animals preanesthetized with Xylazine HCl Injection.<P>
Xylazine HCl Injection has been successfully used as a preanesthetic agent for
sodium pentobarbital, sodium thiopental, sodium thiamylal, nitrous oxide,
ether, halothane, glyceryl guaiacolate and methoxyflurane anesthesia.<P>
<b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS</b><P>
Relative bioavailability and clinical studies were conducted by TechAmerica
Research Center, formerly know as Elars Bioresearch Laboratories, 225 Commerce
Drive, Ft. Collins, CO 80524, under Med-Tech's INAD #2969.  Additionally, a
literature review was submitted which adequately supported the proposed dosage
of xylazine and provided information on the pharmacologic, physiologic and
clinical effects of xylazine at therapeutic and toxic dose levels.<P>
<b>Relative Bioavailability Study</b><P>
A study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of Med-Tech's
Xylazine Hydrochloride Injection and Haver Lockhart's Rompun&#174;, for which there
is an approved NADA.  Twenty healthy, mature horses (ten males and ten females)
of various breeds, ages and weights were randomly assigned to one of two groups
of five males and five females each.  The horses in Group I received a single
intramuscular injection of Med-Tech's product at the rate of 1.0 mg per pound
of body weight and the horses in Group II received Rompun&#174; in the same manner
and at the same dosage level. Following a 14 day washout period, the procedure
was repeated with Group I animals receiving Rompun&#174; and Group II animals
receiving the Med-Tech product.  Plasma xylazine levels and clinical parameters
(attitude, head/neck carriage, ptosis, penile relaxation, audio response,
muscular resistance and analgesia) were monitored following treatment.  The
plasma xylazine profiles were very similar between the products.  Mean areas
under the curves were within 2%, mean maximum concentrations were within 19%,
and mean times at maximum concentrations were within 10%. Standard deviations
and coefficients of variation were comparable for each test material.
Statistical analyses were conducted on the parameters used to define the blood
level profiles, and no statistically significant differences were found between
Haver Lockhart's Rompun&#174; and Med-Tech's Xylazine HCl Injection.  This study
demonstrates the bioequivalency of the Med-Tech Xylazine HCl Injection and
Haver Lockhart's Rompun&#174; xylazine injectable solution in terms of blood level
profiles and no statistically significant differences were found between Harver
Lockhart's Rompun&#174; xylazine injectable solution in terms of blood level profiles
and clinical parameters.<P>
<b>Clinical Trials</b><P>
Clinical studies were conducted to determine the clinical sedative
effectiveness of Med-Tech's Xylazine Hydrochloride Injection in horses, and to
compare the effectiveness of Med-Tech's xylazine with that of Rompun&#174;(Harver
Lockhart) in producing sedation in horses.  The following licensed practicing
veterinarians conducted the studies:<P>

Forty two horses received Med-Tech's Xylazine HCl Injection (21 intravenously
and 21 intramuscularly) and 41 received Rompun&#174; (20 intravenously and 21
intramuscularly).  Each horse received a single treatment of xylazine at the
recommended level of 0.5 mg/pound for intravenous administration or 1.0
mg/pound for intramuscular administration.  The extent of sedation in each
animal was scored prior to treatment and at 10 minutes (IV) or 15 minutes (IM)
post treatment.  Following the performance of a clinical procedure, the overall
sedation was evaluated by the investigator.  Quantitatively, the two drugs
scored similarly with respect to post treatment sedation; however, the
intravenous mode of administration scored higher than the intramuscular mode
for both drugs.<P>
The overall evaluations were statistically analyzed using multiway tables and a
log linear model.  A Chi-square analysis using a model of marginal association
revealed no statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) interactions between
treatments, modes of administration or investigators.  The data support the
effectiveness of Med-Tech's Xylazine HCl Injection and the therapeutic
equivalency of Med-Tech's product and Rompun&#174; as a sedative.<P>

<b>V. SAFETY:</b><P>
To determine whether there were any toxic effects due to Med-Tech's Xylazine
HCl Injection when administered intravenously to horses, a target animal safety
study was also conducted by the TechAmerica Research Center.  Twelve healthy
horses were randomly assigned to one of three groups with an equal number of
males and females within each group.  The horses in Group I received only
physiological saline solution at 0.015 ml per pound one time.  The animals in
Groups II and III were treated once intravenously with Med-Tech's Xylazine
HCl Injection (100 mg xylazine base/ml) at one and three times,  respectively,
the recommended rate of 0.5 mg/pd.  Body weights were determined on days -7,
0, (prior to treatment) and 7.  Clinical observations for signs of
toxicity were conducted on days -7, and -1, prior to treatment on day 0, at
0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 hours post treatment, and twice daily on days
1 through 7.  In addition to the standard observations, scored evaluation
of neck and head carriage, ptosis, lower lip relaxation and attitude were
performed prior to treatment and at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0 and
5.0 hours following treatment.  Physical examinations were conducted on days
-7, -1, 1, 3 and 7.  Samples for hematology and serum chemistry
evaluation were collected simultaneously with the physical examinations and
also on day 0 (prior to treatment). Rectal temperature, heart rate and
respiration rate were monitored in each animal twice daily on days -7 through
7 and feed and water consumption were measured daily for each animal on
days -7 through 7.<P>
Electrocardiograms were conducted prior to treatment and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10,
20, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes post treatment.  No pathologic examinations were
necessary as there were no deaths in any of the groups.  Results revealed no
significant treatment effects for body weight, temperature, respiratory rate or
feed and water consumption.  As expected, animals receiving 1.5mg xylazine per
pound of body weight exhibited a greater degree of sedation and more pronounced
clinical responses (i.e., depression, inactivity, incoordination, drop in head
and neck carriage, ptosis and lower lip relaxation) than those animals
receiving 0.5 mg xylazine per
pound. Animals receiving saline exhibited no sedation or clinical
responses.  Conventional one-way analyses of variance revealed statistically
significant (P&lt;0.05) differences between Groups I and II for protime 
(prothrombin time) on
day 3 and for alkaline phosphatase on days 1, 3 and 7 and between
Groups I and III for direct bilirubin on day 7.  In all cases, however,
values remained within normal limits and the differences were not treatment
related.  The only adverse effects related to treatment were transient cardiac
dysrhythmia, primarily decreased heart rate and second degree atrioventricular
blocks, observed in both treatment groups.  Two animals receiving the proposed
product at three times the recommended dose went down approximately one minute
after treatment but were standing again within three minutes.  A two-sample
t-test was performed on the changes in the electrocardiograph values from their
pre-treatment levels. Several statistically significant (P&lt;.05) differences
were noted at many of the time points between the control group and one or both
treatment groups.  The interferences with cardiac conductivity are widely
recognized as transient effects of xylazine treatment and are of questionable
clinical significance.<P>
<b>VI. HUMAN SAFETY</b><P>
Human Food Safety - As labeled, the drug poses no hazard to human safety
pertaining to drug residues, because it is labeled for use in animals not
intended for food (horses).<P>
Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration - The labeling
contains adequate caution/warning statements.<P>
<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  The data
demonstrate that Xylazine HCl Injection, when used under its labeled conditions
of use, is safe and effective.<P>
Xylazine HCl Injection is used in the horse when conducting various diagnostic,
orthopedic, and dental procedures, for minor surgical procedures of short
duration, and as a preanesthetic to local or general anesthesia, all of which
are procedures which should be performed by a licensed veterinarian only.

Summary</b><p>
<b>I. General Information</b><p>

<b>NADA Number:</b>     140-448<p>
<b>Sponsor:</b><p>             Pfizer Inc.<br>
                    235 East 42nd St.<br>
                    New York, NY 10017<p>
<b>Generic Name:</b>        Oxytetracycline + Salinomycin sodium<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b>           Terramycin + Bio-Cox<p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC<p>
                    <b>Note:</b><p> The present application provides for                                  the combined use in
Type C Medicated feeds 
                    of two presently approved Type A Medicated 
                    Articles, Terramycin (oxytetracycline) and 
                    Bio-Cox (salinomycin sodium), rather than 
                    one Type A Medicated Article incorporating 
                    both of these compounds.<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>April 13, 1990<p>
<b>II. Indications For Use</b> <p>
As an aid in the reduction of mortality due to air sacculitis (air sac
infection) caused by <i>Escherichia coli </i>&#160;sensitive to oxytetracycline and
for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria necatrix, E. tenella, E.
acervulina, E. brunetti, E. mivati</i>&#160; and <i>E. maxima </i>.<p>

<b>III. Dosage Form</b> <p>
Currently approved Type A Medicated Articles of Terramycin manufactured by
Pfizer under NADA 8-804 (approved by letter dated 5/5/53) and Bio-Cox
manufactured by A.H. Robins under NADA 128-686 (48 FR 30616, July 5, 1983)
serve as the dosage formulations.<p>
These Type A Medicated Articles are used to manufacture Type C Medicated
broiler chicken feeds containing 500 g/ton of oxytetracycline (from Terramycin)
and range of 40 to 60 g/ton of salinomycin sodium (from Bio-Cox) to be fed for
5 days as the sole ration.<p>

<b>IV. Effectiveness</b><p>
The original NADA for Bio-Cox (salinomycin sodium) contained adequate data to
establish that salinomycin sodium at a range of 40 to 60 g/ton in finished feed
is safe and effective for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria
tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti </i>&#160;and <i>E.
mivati </i>.  Terramycin (oxytetracycline) is approved at 500 g/ton in the
finished feed as an aid in the reduction of mortality due to air sacculitis
(air sac infection) caused by <i>Escherichia coli </i>&#160;sensitive to
oxytetracycline.  In the present NADA it has been established that the
combination of Terramycin at 500 g/ton and Bio-Cox at 40 to 60 g/ton does not
interfere with the efficacy of the individual drugs.<p>
<b>A. Non-Interference Studies</b><p>
Three separate studies were conducted utilizing 14-16 day old broiler
chickens to test for non-interference of Terramycin with the anticoccidial
effectiveness of Bio-Cox.  In each study the birds were divided into five
treatment groups: I- uninfected, unmedicated; II- infected, unmedicated; III-
infected, salinomycin 40 g/ton; IV- infected, oxytetracycline 500 g/ton; V-
infected, oxytetracycline 500 g/ton plus salinomycin 40 g/ton.  An additional
group of infected, unmedicated birds was included in each study solely for
documentation of the infection.<p>
In the first study (Table 1) the infected treatment groups were challenged with
an inoculum of <i>E. acervulina / mivati, E. maxima</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella </i>.  
In the second
two studies (Tables 2 and 3) the infected treatment groups were challenged with
an inoculum of <i>E. necatrix, E. brunetti</i>&#160; and <i>E. acervulina / mivati </i>.  This
arrangement facilitated identification of lesions.  Treatment effects were
based on mortality, dropping scores, lesion scores, weight gain, feed
conversion and live bird weight.<p>
The results of the above studies (Tables 1,2 &amp; 3) demonstrate that
oxytetracycline at 500 g/ton in Type C Medicated feed of broiler chickens does
not interfere with the anticoccidial activity of salinomycin sodium when fed at
its lowest approved level.<p>

In three other studies 14-16 day old broiler chickens were used to
demonstrate the non-interference of salinomycin sodium with the efficacy of
oxytetracycline against <i>E. coli</i>&#160; infections.  The studies contained the
following five treatment groups: uninfected, unmedicated; infected,
unmedicated; infected salinomycin 60 g/ton; infected oxytetracycline 500 g/ton;
infected salinomycin 60 g/ton plus oxytetracycline 500 g/ton.  The air sacs
were cultured for presence of <i>E. coli</i>&#160; from all birds dying post infection and
from survivors at study end.  Lesion scores were given to all dead birds and
birds sacrificed at study end based on gross observation of the air sacs, liver
and heart.<p>
The results of these studies are found in Tables 4, 5a and 5b.  These results
demonstrate that salinomycin at 60 g/ton does not interfere with the
antibacterial activity of oxytetracycline at 500 g/ton when both are fed in
combination.<p>

<b>V. Animal Safety</b><p>
The original approved NADA's for Terramycin NADA 8-804 (approved by letter
dated 5/5/53) and Bio-Cox NADA 128-686 (48 FR 30616, July 5, 1983) contained adequate
data to establish the safety of each drug for broiler chickens.<p>
The safety of the combination of the two drugs was demonstrated in the drug
residue elimination studies and the non-interference studies. There were no
adverse reactions observed in any of the studies attributable to the drug
combination.<p>
The data provided evidence for the combination of Bio-Cox at 40 to 60 g/ton and
Terramycin at 500 g/ton in the feed of broiler chickens and are consistent with
and fulfill all the requirements for a fixed combination drug for animals as
follows:<p><ul>
<li>A. Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed effects.<p>
<li>B. The dosages of each drug component are such that the combination of safe and
effective.<p>
<li>C. Each drug component is utilized presently in an animal population for
prevention of disease.  The combination usage permits appropriate flexibility
to fit drug use to the needs of individual flock management and disease
prevention requirements for the same animal population.<p>
<li>D. The label claims are not antagonistic.</li></ul><p>

<b>VI. Human Safety</b><p>

<b>A. Toxicity tests</b><p>
The toxicity studies that support the safe use of oxytetracycline in broiler
chickens are filed in NADAs 8-804 and 11-034 and VMF 3651.  The safe use of
salinomycin in broiler chickens was established by toxicity studies described
in the Freedom of Information Summary for NADA 128-686.<p>

<b>B. Safe concentrations of residues</b><p>
The tolerances for microbiologically active residues of oxytetracycline in
edible tissues of chickens are established at 1.0 ppm in muscle, liver and
skin/fat and 3.0 ppm in kidney (21 CFR 556.500).<p>
The safe concentration for total residues of salinomycin in broiler chickens
are 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat as described
in the Freedom of Information Summary for NADA 128-686.  The basic approval of
salinomycin for use in broiler chickens (not in combination with other drugs)
was granted under NADA 128-686 without a tolerance based on a marker residue.
A marker residue, tolerance, and regulatory analytical method were not required
for that approval because total residues of the drug in the tissues of treated
chickens were shown to be well below the safe concentrations listed above in
the tissues of chickens at zero withdrawal.<p>
In an addendum to the Human Safety section of the original FOI Summary for NADA
128-686, the level of 0.2 ppm was assigned as the maximum amount of
unmetabolized salinomycin that can be present in the skin/fat of treated
chickens for the drug use to qualify for zero withdrawal. For the purpose of
evaluating drug combinations with salinomycin, the 0.2 ppm level of salinomycin
in skin/fat is used as the criterion of noninterference on the depletion of
residues of salinomycin by the other drug(s) in the combination.<p>

<b>C. Residue depletion noninterference study</b><p>
The noninterference by oxytetracycline on the depletion of residues of
salinomycin and the noninterference by salinomycin on the depletion of
residues of oxytetracycline was demonstrated in a study in broiler chickens
conducted with the three-way combination of oxytetracycline, salinomycin and
roxarsone.  The chickens in that study were arranged in two groups and received
either medicated feed or control feed as shown below.<p>

</pre>
For the evaluation of the two-way combination of oxytetracycline and
salinomycin, chickens were killed in groups on days 41, 42 and 43 of the study
to provide tissues from birds at 0, 1 and 2 days of withdrawal.  The
assays for residues of oxytetracycline were performed on tissues collected at
0, 1 and 2 days of withdrawal by a method based on the test organism
<i>Bacillus cereus var. mycoides</i>&#160; for the detection of microbiologically active
residues of the drug.  That method had a sensitivity of 0.15 ppm for kidney,
muscle and skin/fat and 0.25 for liver.<p>
Residues of salinomycin were assayed only in the skin/fat samples from chickens
killed at 0 withdrawal.  The analytical method for residues of salinomycin
was an HPLC method for parent (unmetabolized) salinomycin developed by A.H.
Robins Co.  The limit of quantitation by that method is 0.1 ppm in skin/fat.<p>
The results of the assays are shown in Table 6 below.  Those data confirm that
the components of the three-way combination do not interfere with the depletion
of residues of oxytetracycline or salinomycin in the edible tissues of treated
chickens.  This allows the 24 hour withdrawal period established for the
oxytetracycline (500 g/ton) and salinomycin (75 g/ton) in broiler feed.<p>

</pre>

<b>D. Assay Non Interference Studies</b><p>
The noninterference of salinomycin and roxarsone on the assay for
oxytetracycline was demonstrated by the analysis of combined solutions of
oxytetracycline, salinomycin and roxarsone containing 1.0 ppm of each drug.
The recovery of oxytetracycline by that procedure was 105%.<p>
The noninterference of oxytetracycline and roxarsone on the HPLC assay used to
measure residues of salinomycin was demonstrated in a spiking study in which
control skin/fat homogenate containing 0.7 ppm salinomycin was spiked with 1
ppm oxytetracycline and 2 ppm roxarsone. Analysis by the HPLC assay indicated a
salinomycin level of 0.75 ppm (107% recovery), confirming the noninterference
at the 0.7 ppm level.<p>

<b>VII. Agency Conclusions</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and demonstrate that the combination of salinomycin sodium at
concentrations of 40 to 60 g/ton (.0044 - .0066%) plus oxytetracycline at 500
g/ton (.055%) in Type C Medicated feed for broilers is safe and effective for
the indications stated on the product labeling.<p>
The tolerances for residues of oxytetracycline in edible tissue of chicken are
established at 3 ppm in uncooked kidney and 1.0 ppm in uncooked muscle, liver,
fat and skin (21 CFR 556.500).  Safe concentrations of total residue of
salinomycin in edible tissues of chickens are 0.6 ppm for muscle, 1.8 ppm for
liver and 1.2 ppm for skin/fat.  The data submitted in support of the NADA show
that the residues of oxytetracycline were below the established tolerance in
edible tissue and that the residues of salinomycin were below the safe
concentration in the edible tissues.  The agency has concluded that the residue
composition will not be altered, based on the depletion characteristic of the
drugs when used in combination.<p>
The 24 hour withdrawal time before slaughter is satisfactory.<p>
Adequate directions for lay use of the proposed drug combination in broiler
chickens have been written for the requested claims of this NADA.  Also the two
drugs, salinomycin and oxytetracycline, when used separately in feed for the
same uses are approved for over the counter sale, and that there is nothing
about the combination of the two drugs that would require the marketing status
to be changed.<p>

    <b>Trade Name: </b> IVOMEC&#174;  Premix for Swine<p>    
<b>Marketing Status: </b>OTC<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>September 23, 1993<p>
<b>2.    Indications for Use </b><p>    For the treatment and control of
gastrointestinal roundworms <i>(Ascaris  suum , </i>adults and fourth-stage
larvae; <i>Ascarops strongylina , </i>adults;     <i>Hyostrongylus rubidus ,
</i>adults and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Oesophagostomum   </i>&#160; spp. adults and

(<i> Haematopinus suis  </i>) and mange mites ( <i> Sarcoptes    scabiei </i>&#160; var.
<i>suis  </i> ) when incorporated into complete swine feeds at the  level
listed in the table below. Follow mixing directions when preparing   complete
feeds.<p>
 <b>3.     Dosage Form, Route of Administration, and Recommended
Dosage         </b><p>
Add IVOMEC Premix to starter, grower and finisher feeds at 300 g per ton   to
supply 1.8 g ivermectin per ton (2 ppm) of feed. Use this Type C  Medicated Feed
as the only feed for 7 consecutive days. This provides    approximately 100 mcg
of ivermectin per kg of bodyweight per day. <p>    <b>300g </b> <p>   Required amount of
IVOMEC Premix (Type A) Medicated Article 0.6 &#37; to     medicate one ton of
complete (Type  C) Medicated Feed <p>  <b> 1.8g</b><p> Required level of ivermectin per
ton of complete (Type C) Medicated Feed. <p>
IVOMEC Premix should be thoroughly and evenly mixed in the feed in accordance
with good manufacturing practices for medicated feeds. Dispersion of ivermectin
in the feed is enhanced by diluting 1 part ivermectin Type A Medicated Article
with 14 parts of finely ground feed ingredients to provide an intermediate
premix. Ten lb of this intermediate premix is used to provide 1.8 g ivermectin
in one ton of complete Type C Medicated Feed.  <p>
 <b>4.     Effectiveness</b> <p>
  Several formulations of ivermectin, including an injectable formulation
for swine, are currently marketed by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. as effective
antiparasitic agents for various animal species. Data collected from a
development program that included 26 clinical studies conducted in diverse
areas of the United States  as well as a number of international sites
demonstrate that ivermectin as  a 0.6&#37; w/w Type A medicated article added to
the ration at a rate to provide 2 ppm ivermectin (equivalent to approximately
100 mcg/kg/day) and fed to pigs for seven consecutive days effectively controls
a wide range of economically important endo- and ectoparasites of growing
swine. All of the studies involving efficacy evaluations against parasites were
conducted as controlled studies. Both ecto-and endoparasite counts of treated
swine were compared with those of untreated controls. The pigs were either
experimentally or naturally infected with one or more species of ectoparasites
(lice and mites) or endoparasites (nematodes). Each claim for a parasite
species was supported by at least two controlled studies. Efficacy was
expressed as percentage (&#37;) reduction of parasites as compared to controls. The
&#37; reduction was calculated as follows:<p>


<pre>

                    (Arithmetic mean number of parasites in control swine - 
Percentage           Arithmetic  mean number of parasites in treated swine)
Reduction of   =  ----------------------------------------------------------  X 100
Parasites            Arithmetic mean number of parasites in control swine
    

</pre>
 
The efficacy of ivermectin was at least 93&#37; for each endoparasite claim except
for the fourth-stage larvae of <i>Oesophagostomum </i>&#160; spp. (90&#37;) while
ectoparasite populations were reduced following treatment. Data from United
States and international studies supports the claim that ivermectin
administered in the ration of growing swine at 2 ppm for seven consecutive days
is effective against adult and larval stages of the important nematode and
arthropod parasites that affect swine.<P>
<b>A. Dose Titration</b><p>
  Dose titration studies were conducted to determine the amount of
ivermectin that would be required in a seven-day treatment regimen to control
swine endo- and ectoparasites. One ectoparasite study, and two endoparasite
studies, each including eight controls and 24 medicated swine were conducted.
Ivermectin dosages of 0, 50, 100 or 200 mcg/kg/day for seven consecutive days
were evaluated. Local procedures were followed regarding animal husbandry
during the studies and standard procedures were used for allocating animals,
collecting samples, enumerating and identifying parasites and performing
necropsies.  The endoparasite studies used induced infections but naturally
infested animals were used in the ectoparasite study. Based on the data
collected, the optimum dose was determined to be 100 mcg/kg/day for seven
days.<p>
<b>Ectoparasite Dose Titration</b><P>
  Study 12581 was conducted in the United States to establish the optimum
level of ivermectin effective against <i>Sarcoptes scabiei </i>&#160;var <i>suis 
</i>. Thirty-two pigs with natural infestations were randomly allocated into four
groups and fed ivermectin in feed at 0, 50, 100 or 200 mcg/kg/day for seven
consecutive days, followed by nonmedicated ration until the study was
terminated. Mites in scrapings from specified areas of the skin were counted.
Mite infestation was markedly reduced in all ivermectin-treated pigs at seven
days after the termination of treatment and these animals were free of
infestation on Day 42 of the study. The medicated rations were readily
consumed. No adverse reactions were observed during the course of the study.
Data from the controls and pigs treated with ivermectin are listed below.<p>

<b>Endoparasite Dose Titration</b><P>
  Study 12583 was conducted in the United States to establish the optimum
level of ivermectin in feed against nematodes. Thirty-two pigs were
artificially infected and randomly allocated to four groups of equal size. When
the nematodes were in the fourth larval stage (L4), the groups were given
ivermectin in feed at 0, 50, 100 or 200 mcg/kg/day for seven days followed by
nonmedicated ration until the study was terminated. Necropsies were performed
16 to 17 days after the termination of treatment and the reductions in
nematode counts are summarized below. The medicated rations were readily

Study 12443 was conducted in West Germany to establish the optimum level of
ivermectin in feed against immature <i>Hyostrongylus rubidus </i>. Thirty-two
pigs with induced infections were randomly allocated to four groups of equal
size. When the nematodes were in the fourth larval stage (L4), the groups were
given ivermectin in feed at 0, 50, 100 or 200 
mcg/kg/day for seven days, followed by nonmedicated ration until the study was
terminated. Necropsies were performed 35-37 days after the termination of
treatment and the findings listed below recorded. The medicated ration was
readily consumed. No adverse reactions were observed during the course of the
study.<p>

<b>Justification of Dose Selection</b><P>
  Results from the above dose titration studies showed that 100 mcg/kg/day
for seven days was adequate to control <i>Sarcoptes scabiei </i>&#160; var <i>suis
</i>&#160; as well as L4  nematodes. Dose responses observed against L4 nematodes
in two separate studies support the selection of 100 mcg/kg/day. <p>
 <b>B. Dose Confirmation</b> <p>
   Eight dose confirmation studies were conducted with ectoparasites
(mange mites and swine lice). The studies  included 105 ivermectin-treated pigs
and 105 controls. The infestations were naturally acquired in five studies and
induced in three. The parasite numbers were recorded from selected sample
sites. The reductions of <i>Sarcoptes scabiei </i>&#160; var <i>suis </i>&#160; and
<i>Haematopinus suis </i>&#160; are summarized  in Table 1. <p>

Confirmation of the dose selected for endoparasites (gastrointestinal,
pulmonary and kidney nematodes) was affirmed in 15 controlled studies. The
dose-confirmation data were obtained using 181 ivermectin-treated pigs and 181
controls. Infections were acquired naturally in eight of the studies and were
induced in seven. All pigs were killed 14 to 180 days after treatment for
parasite recoveries. Table 2 contains a summary of the reductions obtained.<p>

<b>5.    Target Animal Safety</b><p>
Study 12768 was conducted in the United States to assess the safety of the
in-feed formulation of ivermectin in pigs when included in the ration at levels
up to 10 ppm (five times the recommended dose) for 21 consecutive days (three
times the recommended treatment period). Twelve castrated males and an equal
number of female eight-week old pigs were assigned randomly to four treatment
groups and housed individually. They were fed a basal ration that contained
ivermectin in feed at 0, 2, 6 or 10 ppm for 21 days. Weight gain, feed
consumption and clinical health during the study were recorded. Blood was
collected for clinicopathologic evaluation.<p>
No treatment-related adverse findings were observed during routine clinical
evaluation or during necropsy and histopathological review. No significant
treatment effects on weight gain and feed consumption were detected.<p>

<b>6.   Human Food Safety</b><p>
<b>A.   Toxicity Tests</b><p>
The toxicology studies conducted to support the safe concentration of
ivermectin in swine edible tissues are summarized in NADA 135-008.<p>
<b>B.   Safe Concentration of Residues</b><p>
The lowest no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) in the battery of toxicity studies
described above were determined in the multigeneration study in rats (0.1
mg/kg/day) and in the oral teratogenic study in the mouse (0.1 mg/kg/day for
maternotoxicity and 0.2 mg/kg/day for teratogenicity). The minimum safety
margins required for the effects observed in these studies are 100x for the
multigeneration study and for the maternotoxicity in the mouse teratological
study and 1000x for the teratological effects also seen in the latter study.
Due to the significance of the terata (cleft palate) seen in the teratology
study the 1000x safety factor was used for determining an acceptable daily
intake (ADI) of up to 0.2 micrograms per kg per day of ivermectin residue by an
individual in food.<p>
<pre>

              0.2 mg/kg/day
ADl  &#61;  ---------------------------  &#61;  0.2 mcg/kg/day 
           1000 safety factor


</pre> 
A safe concentration in muscle tissue of swine is calculated from the
acceptable daily intake, assuming the average weight of man to be 60 kg and the
daily human intake of muscle to be 500 g, as follows:<p>

<pre>

                             (60 kg)(0.2 mcg/kg/day)
safe concentration  &#61;  -----------------------------------  &#61;  24 ppb 
    in muscle                       500 g/day


</pre>
 
When rounded to the nearest 5 ppb, the safe concentration in muscle then
becomes 25 ppb. The safe concentration of residues in liver, kidney and fat are
determined from this number using appropriate food consumption values (food
factor) for these tissues. Therefore, the safe concentrations are:

<pre>


Liver:    25 ppb x 3 (food factor) &#61;  75 ppb
Kidney:   25 ppb x 4 (food factor) &#61; 100 ppb
Fat:      25 ppb x 4 (food factor) &#61; 100 ppb

<b>C.  Metabolism and Total Residue Depletion Studies</b><p>
Total radioactive residue (averaged value from three animals) in edible tissues
of swine dosed with 3H-labeled MK-933 orally at 100 g/kg body weight/day for 7
days in the feed is shown in the table below:<p>

</pre>
 
Examination of the residue data and unaltered drug depletion patterns shows that
fat and liver generally contain the highest and most persistent residue. The
fat residue levels are slightly higher than the liver at almost all time
points, although the unaltered drug depletion pattern in both tissues is
essentially similar, i.e., the unaltered drug is a satisfactory marker
substance. Because of the integrity of the liver as one organ 
and the relative difficulty in extracting and isolating the marker substance
from fat, the liver is considered the preferred target tissue.<p>
The radioactive residue in the edible tissues examined is essentially all
extractable into organic solvents indicating that there is very little, if any,
intractable, covalently bound residue in these tissues. The unaltered drug 
( H2B1a and H2Blb, respectively) acoounts for about 45&#37; (33 &#43; 12&#37;) and 34&#37; (26
&#43; 8&#37;) of the total radioactive residue in liver on-drug and 3 days off-drug,
respectively. In fat, the unaltered drug accounts for about 77&#37; (66 &#43; 11&#37;) of
the total residue on-drug and 64&#37; (56 &#43; 8&#37;) at 3 days off-drug.<p>

Livers from two on drug (1 barrow and 1 gilt) and three 3-day off-drug (1 barrow
and 2 gilts) swine were used for metabolism studies. In these samples,
unaltered drug accounts for about 38 and 34&#37; [by normal-phase (NP) HPLC] of the
residue, respectively. Metabolites can be separated into a polar group (17 and
12&#37;, respectively), 3"-O-desmethyl and drug-like (43 and 50&#37;, respectively) and
nonpolar (4 and 5&#37;, respectively). By reversed-phase high performance liquid
chromatography (RP-HPLC), H2Bla component comprised about 34&#37; of the total
radioactivity in the on-drug livers and about 28&#37; in the 3-day off-drug livers.
The H2Blb component coeluted with 3"-O-desmethyl-H2Bla, but these compounds
were separated by NP-HPLC. The H2Blb component comprised about 7&#37; of the
radioactivity in the on-drug and about 6&#37; in 3-day off-drug livers while the
3"-O-desmethyl H2B1a component was about 27&#37; and 30&#37; of the radioactivity in the
on-drug and 3-day off-drug livers, respectively. There were at least two
metabolites that eluted in the polar fraction during the NP-HPLC where the
24-hydroxymethyl metabolites would be expected. Metabolites less polar than the
H2B1a component comprised only 3-7&#37; of the radioactivity in any of the
liver samples. The remainder of the radioactivity in the livers, about 12&#37;
on-drug and about 16&#37; 3-days off-drug, was comprised of at least two "drug-like"
components, one of which was identified as 3"-0-desmethyl-H2Blb by its
chromatographic behavior on NP and RP-HPLC. None of the unidentified components
of the residue in liver represented as much as 10&#37; of the total residue nor
were present at a concentration of &gt;0.1 ppm.  <p>
The metabolism of MK-933 in swine fat is qualitatively similar to that in the
swine liver. The compositions of the radioactive residues (determined by
NP-HPLC) in on-drug and 3-day off-drug swine fat samples are respectively;
unaltered drug, 75 and 64&#37;; non-polar metabolites, 10 and 23&#37;; drug-like
metabolites, 11 and 9&#37;; and polar metabolites, 7 and 6&#37;. The distribution of
radioactive components in the livers and fat of the swine fed ivermectin is
qualitatively similar to the distribution of components following subcutaneous
dosing.<p>
Comparative metabolism studies indicate that the metabolism of MK-933 in swine
and rat, the toxicity test species, is qualitatively similar. In both species,
the unaltered drug is the major residue. The HPLC profiles of the radioactive
residue in the liver  are qualitatively similar with respect to the metabolite
components, but quantitatively different in the abundance of some metabolite
components. The major metabolites in swine liver are 3"-O-desmethyl-H2B1a and
3"-O-desmethyl-H2B1b, whereas in rat liver, the major polar metabolites are
24-hydroxymethyl-H2B1a and 24-hydroxymethyl-H2B1b. The presence of
24-hydroxymethylH2B1a and 24-hydroxymethyl-H281b in the on-drug and 3 days
off-drug livers of the swine dosed orally with MK-933 in feed is indicated by
radioactive peaks with retention times characteristic of these components. The
presence of a small amount of 3"-O-desmethyl products in rat liver is suggested
by the presence of a small radioactive peak with retention time identical to
the 3"-O-desmethyl compounds. Thus, the test species is exposed to the major
drug residue components known to be present in swine tissues.<p>
<b>D.   Studies Demonstrating a Withdrawal Time</b><p>
A tissue residue depletion study was performed to determine the marker residue
(component H2B1a)  concentration in swine tissues resulting from the feeding
of animals continuously for seven days with ivermectin premlx combined in a
complete feed at 2 ppm. Three barrows and two gilts were sacrificed at each
withdrawal time. The withdrawal times following the end of the medication
period were 0 (on the seventh day of medication), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5 and
7 days. Another set of five animals served as unmedicated controls. <p>
Marker residue assays were conducted on swine livers (the target tissue) for
selected withdrawal times using the high pressure liquid
chromatography-fluorescence determinative method. The average marker residue
concentrations found were as follows:<p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 8 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>

</pre>
The analytical method used to determine the marker residue has a lower limit of
reliable measurement of 10 ppb. The Rm  value (marker residue concentration
tolerance) for swine derived from toxicity and metabolism data has been
determined to be 20 ppb, which is the same tolerance established for swine in
NADA 135-008. Statistical analysis of the depletion data, using the upper
tolerance limit containing 99 percentile of the population with 95&#37; confidence,
yields a withdrawal period of 5 days. <p>
  <b>E. Regulatory Methods</b><p>
<b>Ivermectin  Determinative Assay Scheme</b><p>
The determinative assay measures the marker residue, 22,23-dihydroavermectin
Bla by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of a fluorescent derivative.
The marker residue is extracted into isooctane from an aqueous acetone
homogenate of liver tissue. The isooctane is removed by evaporation and the
extract purified by a series of acetonitrile-hexane-water partitions. The
fluorescent derivative is formed by heating with an acetic anhydride &#43;
methylimidazole reagent. A chloroform solution is purified over a silica column
and concentrated by evaporation; reverse phase HPLC is performed using
methanol/water and fluorescence detection. Quantitation is obtained by using a
standard curve for the marker residue carried through the derivatization and
subsequent steps. Recoveries are in the range of 75-95&#37; with a lower limit of
reliable measurement of 10 ppb.<p>
<b>Ivermectin Confirmatory Assay Scheme</b><p>
The sample preparation and purification steps of the confirmatory assay are
essentially the same as the determinative assay. The specificity is obtained by
the production of two new species just prior to derivatization. The new species
are produced by removing one of the saccharide groups with 1&#37; sulfuric acid in
isopropanol to form the 
monosaccharide or removing both saccharide groups with 1&#37; sulfuric acid in
methanol to form the aglycone of 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a.  Since these
two treatments are so  
 similar, the formation of the two new species and their chromatographic
properties are unique and hence confirm the presence of the marker
residue. <p>
In the confirmatory test, the liver extract is split into three parts. One part
is used for each of the sulfuric acid treatments. These samples are separated
from sulfuric acid by extractions and the fiuorescent derivatives of the two
new compounds are made. The third aliquot is derivatized without pretreatment.
All three derivatives are then extracted into hexane with a small amount of
isobutyl alcohol present. The high pressure liquid chromatography determination
is made as in the determinative assay. Three separate peaks are observed at
three separate retention times which are compared with standards run through
the procedure from the sulfuric acid addition step onward. Presence of and
quantitation of the three peaks is confirmation that ivermectin is present.<p>
<b>Validation</b><p>
The determinative and confirmatory methods were validated satisfactorily by FDA
and USDA laboratories utilizing bovine and ovine tissue. It was not deemed
necessary to repeat these methods trials with porcine tissue. The validated
regulatory analytical methods for detection of residues of ivermectin are filed
in the Food Additives Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public
Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857).<p>
<b>7.    Agency Condusions </b><p>
The data submitted in support of this original NADA comply with the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that ivermectin 0.6&#37;
Type A medicated artide when used under the proposed conditions of use, is safe
and effective. These data from the controlled studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of ivermectin for its labeled indications in swine feeds when fed
at 100 mcg/kg body weight for a period of 7 consecutive days. These studies
demonstrate the efficacy of a 7 consecutive day regimen for treatment and
control of <i>Ascaris suum</i>&#160;- adult and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Ascarops
strongylina</i>&#160;- adults; <i>Hyostrongylus rubidus</i>&#160;- adult and fourth-stage larvae;
<i>Oesophagostomum </i>&#160;spp.- adult and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Stephanurus
dentatus</i>&#160;- adult  and fourth-stage larvae; <i>Metastrongylus </i>&#160;spp.- adult;
<i>Haernatopinus suis; </i>&#160;and <i>Sarcoptes scabiei </i>&#160;var. <i>suis </i>. 
 <p>
The withdrawal period for swine is 5 days. The safe concentration for total
ivermectin residues in uncooked edible swine tissues has been established as 25
ppb in muscle, 75 ppb in liver, 100 ppb in kidney, and 100 ppb in fat. A
regulatory tissue residue method has been developed for the determination of
the marker compound, parent ivermectin, with a tolerance of 20 ppb in swine
liver (21 CFR 556.344).<p>
Ivermectin products for use in food producing animals are generally
over-the-counter products. Accurate diagnosis can be made with reasonable
degree of certainty by the layman. Adequate directions for use have been
written for the layman, and the conditions for use prescribed on the labeling
are likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine (CVM) has concluded that this product shall have over-the-counter
marketing status.<p>
Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the FFDCA, this approval for food producing
animals qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because the application contains reports of new clinical or
field investigations essential to the approval of the application and conducted
or sponsored by the applicant.<p>
