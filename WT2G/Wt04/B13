BUSINESS
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Singapore Telecom MobileLink has launched its PCN
service after a US$48m investment in hardware from
Northern Telecom. The service is being marketed
alongside all existing cellular services in operation
with pricing pitched towards the private user. The
installation process has not been that easy.
According to Pascal Debon, VP and general manager of
Nortel GSM Wireless Networks: "In Singapore, Nortel
had to face geographical and technical challenges due
to a very high population density, high-rise
buildings and expressways tunnels.  Specific
equipment has been successfully developed to adapt to
this particularly complex environment and to optimize
the indoor coverage." A number of PCN roaming
agreements are being planned as PCN service rolls
out.

Northern Telecom has revealed that it has advanced
the launch dates of expansion for a Taiwanese GSM
cellular network, bringing it up to five months ahead
of schedule due to tremendous user demand. In
September 1994 the Long Distance Telecommunications
Administration awarded a US$100m supply contract to
Nortel for a GSM digital cellular system in Taiwan
and the network has been operational in phases with
160,000 users online by the end of October with
10,000 new subscribers signing up for service each

Vodac Ltd, the Vodafone Group Plc cellular service

to corporate customers including the provision of
cellular telephony bills on computer disk through the
so-called Call Manager software package.  Customers
have to pay GBP25 per month to receive accounts on

authority card' which allows corporate customers to
receive a repair service from any Vodac Service
Centre throughout the UK and the account can be
settled directly with Vodac. In the new year Vodafone
plans to emulate the 24-hour repair/replacement
scheme first pioneered by Hutchison Telecom/Orange
which will allow customers to get prompt replacement
for faulty cellular equipment, although details are
presently not known.

MOBILE MATTERS-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE AWARDED
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

The Austrian government has awarded the first
competitive GSM cellular licence to a consortium
backed by Siemens and Deutsche Telekom known as Oe-Call.  
Oe-Call bid US$397m for the licence -- the
highest of the five applicants.  Viktor Klima,
transport minister for the Austrian government, said
that the competing service was forecast to bring down
prices by as much as 30%. Some competing consortia
said that the bid was unfair as Siemens was an
important equipment supplier to the Austrian Post
Office -- operators of the other GSM service.  An
appeal is permitted under Austrian law although to
date no company has said that it intends to take
advantage of this option.

Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd in the UK
has given a pledge to the Office of Fair Trading
stating that it will not breach the Resale Prices
Act. The OFT previously launched an investigation
after receiving numerous complaints from dealers who
said that Orange was attempting to impose minimum
resale prices on mobile phone handsets. Under the
Resale Prices Act 1976, it is unlawful for a supplier
of goods to make it a condition of supply that its
goods will not be sold below a specified price. Many
dealers had experienced sudden problems getting new
stock once they had sold phones at a price other than
Orange's recommended price.

Peoples Phone, a large UK independent cellular

Stock Exchange early this year, making its founder
Charles Wigoder a multi-millionaire in the process.
Analysts expect the company to be valued at around
GBP200m although Peoples Phone was not exactly a
rags-to-riches affair for the 35-year-old son of
Liberal peer Lord Wigoder.  The company has rapidly
expanded since its formation in 1988 to a company
turning over GBP118.5m in 1994 through its 175
brightly-decorated retail outlets -- capturing a 7%
stake of the UK market.

MOBILE MATTERS-TEXAN PAGING FIRMS HIT OUT AT LOCAL
TAXATION
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Paging companies in Texas, USA are angry about a new
taxation plan which will, according to them, provide
an unfair burden on their businesses when compared to
other sectors. A tax has been introduced to create a
US$150m fund which will help schools and hospitals
purchase equipment to connect up the information
superhighway, with half of the funding coming from an
assessment on local telephone companies, the other
half from the wireless industry, comprising mainly of
cellular and paging businesses. The wireless industry
contends that they are a smaller business with annual
revenues of around US$1.5bn compared to the wireline
businesses which generate around US$8bn annually.
Administratively, this is causing some problems for
local authority officials as the telecommunications
levy has to raise a fixed amount of money from an
indeterminate number of companies with unpredictable
revenue.  A number of workaround solutions are under
consideration.

According to the UK government's Radiocommunications
Agency, the new Short Range Business Radio service
(SRBR) is set to be introduced in early 1996 which
will allow parties to use their own equipment with a
range of up to 400m without restrictions on
portability or location. The Agency believes that the
SRBR will be of particular use to small businesses
who will be able to take advantages of speech and
paging services on a localised site basis. A licence
costing GBP30 will be required covering a three year
period, although in reality observers suggest that
enforcement will be difficult. Frequencies for SRBR
will be: 461.2625MHz, 461.4750MHz and 461.4875MHz,
for the speech service and 49.2625MHz, 49.2875MHz and
461.3000MHz for the paging service.

PHILIPS COMMUNICATIONS says that its RBS918
GSM/DCS1800 radio base stations recently helped deal
with the world's busiest GSM network, located at the
Telecom  95 exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland. Four
out of the five base stations which covered the
Palexpo site were from Philips and they managed the
highest traffic load ever measured in a GSM network
and successfully mastered a peak traffic load of
about 360,000 calls per day.  Philips said that the
service problem was exacerbated because there were
only a limited number of frequencies available for
GSM as part of the spectrum is still used by the
analogue NMT900 system, that interference to both
French GSM networks had to be considered and that the
large surface of Lake Geneva causes difficult
propagation conditions. Load of the radio channels
reached up to 99.9% frequently throughout the event.

Hutchison Orange, operators of a UK PCN service, has
changed the way they distribute products to the
channel, much to the chagrin of retailers.  A range
of new and existing handsets are now being made
available to dealers at full trade prices with
commission paid upon connection.  When Orange first
launched it sold units at net prices to dealers who
then sold on mark-up. The company claimed that it was
breathing a breath of fresh air into the cellular
marketplace although it denies that it has made a
sudden about turn.   Orange dealers will also be able
to earn extra commission by signing up customers to
higher price plans, based on marketing support
programmes and gimmicky offers.  "Orange if convinced
these proposals will ensure the competitiveness of
the trade proposition for 1996, building on the
excellent results seen since the launch of Orange,"
claimed Gareth Jones, group director of sales.

MOBILE MATTERS-CLAMPDOWN ON UK MOBILE PHONE USERS
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Several cellular service providers are clamping down
on their customers mobile phone usage in a bid to cut
fraud.  One network reseller has already placed a
ceiling of GBP50-worth of calls without a deposit
being paid and large deposits are being demanded off
GSM digital cellular users who wish to take full
advantage of cellular roaming while overseas.
Cellphones Direct, a UK service provider who resells
Vodafone Group airtime, plans to introduce its
cellular ceiling plan in February, despite customer
concern to the plan.  Vodafone and Cellnet, as
network operators, are not responsible for the
charges placed by its reseller agents who deal direct
with members of the public.

The ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY, the British ad
industry watchdog, has clamped down on a number of
firms for their recent breaches of the advertising
code.  PEOPLES PHONE COMPANY PLC has seen a complaint
against it upheld where it offered a free pocket
colour TV on the purchase of a mobile phone.  The
complainant stated that the offer was only valid for
a select number of phones and not the entire range as
implied and noted that the offer was only being
offered for analogue handsets and not the digital
ones.  The company said that the offer applied to all
mobile phones and not all tariffs with the exclusions
listed in footnotes.  The ASA said that the adverts
should have been more clearly stated to avoid
confusion and requested that greater care be taken in
the future. HUTCHISON ORANGE was censured following a
direct mail shot which offered trade-ins through a
dealer which apparently did not exist when the
recipient called local outlets.

digital cellular telephone network during 1996. A
number of roaming agreements have been agreed in

delegates at a recent IT conference that the GSM
digital cellular telephony format is likely to become
the de facto  standard of choice' in the United
States, despite the take up of PCS services. Spindler
said that GSM is a model of technological development
because consumer applications were developed rapidly,
cheaply and a standard was adopted quickly by
Europe's telecommunications authorities.

provides 135 minutes talktime/38 hours standby.  NEC
has also launched its P800 mobile phone, based on the
P7 model, which provides similar talktime and support
as the P8 albeit the phone is in a dark blue shade
and is aimed at the discerning consumer market.

INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES REFLECT ON 1995, LOOK AHEAD TO 1996

     More than a decade ago, a revolutionary service in communications
was born:  cellular.  The cellular industry has come a long way,
changing and growing along the way.  And as 1996 begins, many are
reflecting on the impact 1995 has had on the industry and what the new
year may hold for cellular--domestically, internationally and
technologically.  Several issues raised in 1995 will continue to
affect the industry in 1996.  Instead of rehashing bygone issues of
MPN, we will let a few industry insiders reflect on 1995 and what the
new year has in store for the wireless industry.

  ...From a National Brand Point of View

     "The lesson we learned [in 1995] was the same we have learned--
and learned from--the past 11 years:  Start with your customers," said
Cellular One Group Executive Director Richard Lyons.
     "Looking forward, the new year holds one promise:  exciting
change.  The telecommunications industry will continue its
metamorphosis--the evolution of the telecommunications revolution. 
From the brand perspective, such as Cellular One's, that means that
even in the presence of the immense amount of change that drives the
industry, the key challenge will be to not lose touch with our current
customers and to anticipate the needs of our potential subscribers.
     "In looking at the issues facing the cellular industry as the new
year begins, one stands out:  the need for the cellular industry to
solidify and expand its positioning in the larger telecommunications
marketplace.  This is a direct result of the increased competition
that will occur from the introduction of new wireless technologies,
such as PCS, as well as the entrance of new players into the wireless
industry.  In 1996, the competition could become even more fierce when
Congress passes the telecommunications bill.  Consequently, in 1996,
Cellular One will look at broadening its product and service
offerings.
     "This increase in competition has made the strength of a brand
name more important than ever before.  Consumers have strong brand
preferences and make purchasing decisions daily based on the strength
of a brand name."

  ...From a Resale Point of View

     National Wireless Resellers Association Executive Director David
Gusky predicts resellers will profit in 1996 if 1995 is any
indication.  "[Last year] was a good year for wireless resale in that
more and more companies seeking to enter the wireless marketplace saw
resale as a legitimate means of market entry.
"Nineteen ninety-six should see this trend continue, especially when
you consider the changes in store for the industry.  As an increasing
number of PCS carriers, both broadband and narrowband, open for
business, creating greater competition and network capacity, the stage
will be set for a real boon in wireless resale. Competition will drive
down prices and shrink profit margins, meaning carriers will be
looking for efficient, low-cost distribution channels.  This
situation, together with the excess network capacity that is bound to
occur as PCS carriers build out their systems to comply with FCC
timetables, will prompt carriers to turn to resellers in increasing
numbers to distribute their products and services.  Resale today
accounts for just 3 percent of total revenues in the cellular
marketplace.  When you consider that long-distance resellers account
for 10 percent of their industry's revenues, or more than three times
the market share of their wireless counterparts, and that the wireless
industry will soon take on characteristics of the long-distance
industry in terms of competition and network capacity, we expect good
things to happen in wireless resale in 1996 and for a good many years
to come."

  ...From a Software Solutions Point of View

     Eric Johnson, president and CEO of Coral Systems Inc., had this
to say about the year ahead.  "We will see in the United States, the
emergence of competition into the whole wireless industry.  In the
past, we had the luxury of being able to focus on subscriber
acquisition in a duopoly environment. ...  [In 1996], we will see a
whole different tier of users ..., which will change the way the
wireless industry does business. ...  We're not just cellular anymore. 
We're a wireless industry comprised of many different standards. 
[Nineteen ninety five tells us that] wireless carriers need to focus
on customers."
     Internationally, global system for mobile communications (GSM)
operators are going through the same problems analog carriers in the
United States went through in the early stages of cellular, he said. 
But they are "close to having the majority of them solved.  I think we
will see a dramatic increase in GSM in 1996.  We'll see similar things
with CDMA [code division multiple access].
     "I'd like to say we'll have a resolution between the standards,
but there will probably be a further entrenchment [of differences]. 
Ericsson will be very aggressive in promoting time division multiple
access (TDMA) and GSM.  Competition among infrastructure providers
will increase.  We may see those who have announced what standard they
are going with, reversing [their choices]."
     He said it is unlikely dual-mode phones will pair CDMA, GSM and
TDMA, but rather each of those standards will be paired with analog. 
"Analog will emerge as the common unifier amongst [all the digital
standards]."
     Reflecting on trends that emerged in 1995, Johnson said, "I think
that there has been an enormous increase in fraud awareness."  He
described it as one
of those problems that has always been around, but now that
competition is
becoming more serious, carriers are paying more attention to the
issue.  Also, he said 1995 saw widespread acceptance of selecting a
fraud strategy or platform.  A platform of different fraud solutions
allows carriers to put unrelenting pressure on criminals, which is the
most effective strategy.
     Another trend to emerge in 1995 was the formation of national
alliances.  PCS PrimeCo L.P. Johnson said is a significant example
because it shows how the industry has "reached a phase where your
enemies become your friends."
     What does 1996 hold for Coral Systems?  "We will be announcing
some large strategic relationships early this year that show our
strategic vision, which is basically to give carriers the tools they
need to manage their businesses."

  ...From a Domestic Services Point of View

     In looking at 1995 and the future, Comcast Cellular
Communications Inc. President Don Harris reflected on the industry's
beginnings.  "When the industry first got started, cellular--although
a tremendous advancement in and of itself--was fairly primitive by
today's standards.  Phones were bulky and very expensive.  There was
no such thing as value-added features and services, and carriers
offered relatively few choices for customers.  Today, cellular has
become an incredibly sophisticated industry, offering customers a
dazzling array of equipment and feature options, and more choices than
ever before. ...  With 30 million subscribers and more than 10 percent
national penetration, [the cellular industry] is a classic American
success story."
     "Now, there are as many descriptions of what this wireless future
will look like as there are pundits who observe this industry.  From
our perspective, though, the future is all about being able to respond
to virtually every customer segment with wireless solutions that
enhance productivity and make people's lives easier and more
convenient," Harris said.  "We are emerging as a single-source
provider of wired, wireless and [TV] program content to customers here
in the United States and around the world."

  ...From an International Services Point of View

     According to AirTouch International President and CEO Arun Sarin,
highlights of 1995 included the launch of AirTouch cellular service in
Italy, Spain and India, expansion of its presence in Japan through
several joint ventures, opening of a European headquarters and in the
third quarter of 1995, growth of its international subscriber base by
130 percent compared with the third quarter of 1994.  Looking ahead to
1996, Sarin said he expects AirTouch to bid for licenses in Poland,
the Czech Republic, Brazil, Taiwan and possibly China.  Also, he
expects AirTouch to increase profitability of its operations in Asia
and Europe as well as launch services in South Korea, India and Japan.

  ...From a Technology Point of View

     TDMA Forum Project Manager John McQueen says TDMA is still the
best kept secret in digital cellular.  The Forum grew from 14 to 44
members in 1995 without any formal promotion, McQueen said.  "We have
built the most thorough protocol conformance specification, software
and test procedures to ensure full operability and functionality of
IS-136 mobiles."
     Also in 1995, the Forum uncovered and solved a major analog
compatibility problem that would have kept almost 4 million analog
phones from working on digital networks, and it began discussions on
merging IS-136 and GSM standards.  In 1996, the forum plans major IS-
136 deployments in the first quarter, and will launch an Internet web
site, sign up new members and improve TDMA functionality.

FCC PROPOSES `BILL AND KEEP' FOR CMRS-LEC CONNECTIONS

     To speed competition in both the wireless and local exchange
service markets, the FCC proposed at its December meeting an interim
"bill-and-keep" compensation plan for interconnection of commercial
mobile radio service (CMRS) and local exchange carrier (LEC) networks. 
In initiating CC Docket No. 95-185, the commission also tentatively
concluded that information about CMRS-LEC interconnection arrangements
should be made public, and it is seeking comments on whether to
require tariffs, public disclosure reports or some other alternative
to private contracts.
     For CMRS-LEC interconnection through dedicated transmission
facilities, the commission proposed a compensation plan based on
existing flat-rate access charges for similar facilities.  The FCC
further proposed that CMRS providers be allowed to recover access
charges from interexchange carriers in the same manner the LECs do. 
     Telcos generally have opposed bill-and-keep compensation for
interconnection with any type of competitor--wireline or wireless. 
Under a bill-and-keep system, each service provider terminates the
other carrier's traffic without imposing an interconnection charge. 
The LECs contend that they will be terminating significantly more
outside carrier calls than will other carriers.  
     Commissioners wanted to hear about other types of compensation
plans, but they generally seemed convinced that bill-and-keep was the
best interim choice because of its ease in administration and the
relatively small market share of wireless competitors.  Chairman Reed
Hundt said those proposing another compensation method should "think
hard about the economics and relative market powers of incumbents that
control wireline networks."
     The notice also seeks views on the FCC's jurisdiction in setting
interconnection polices affecting intrastate terminating traffic.

Industry Responds To FCC Proposal

     Soon after the FCC announced its bill-and-keep proposal, Comcast
Corp. President Brian Roberts released a statement applauding the FCC
for its actions.  "[The proposal] may be the single biggest step the
FCC has taken so far to promote local telephone competition," he said. 
"This proposal could make wireless an economically viable way to
compete for all customers."
     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association President Thomas
Wheeler also released a statement favoring the proposal.  "The wire-
less industry commends the FCC for its action today, which will lead
to greater competition in the local telephone market and lower charges
to customers. ...  In 1994, wireless customers paid LECs more than
$800 million to terminate their calls.  Such a fee can only act to
impede development of wireless as a competitive local exchange ser-
vice.  Reciprocal Termination is the solution to this anti-competitive
inequity, as the FCC has wisely proposed."

FCC Simplifies Radio License Application

     At a brown bag luncheon in December, FCC Wireless
Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) Chief Michele Farquhar said she has
approved a simplified, one-page version of Form 600, which is used to
apply for mobile radio licenses.  Farquhar said the Office of
Management and Budget has 120 days to approve the Form 600 EZ before
it can be made available to applicants.  Judy Dunlap, chief of the
FCC's Data Services Branch, said that up to 85 percent of applicants
should be able to use the new form.  In January, the commission also
will begin accepting Form 600 electronically.
     In other FCC news, former Commercial Wireless Division Chief
Rosalind Allen is now associate bureau chief.  David Furth, formerly
deputy chief, will become acting chief of that division.  Larry Atlas
and Daniel Phythyon, formerly associate bureau chiefs, will move to
the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) to work with former WTB Chief Regina
Keeney, who now heads the CCB.  Coming from the CCB, Karen Brinkman
will join the WTB this month to assist with local competition issues. 
Farquhar also expressed interest in creating a new division
specializing in public safety issues.

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA OUTPACES OTHER REGIONS, STUDY SAYS

     The cellular subscriber base of Latin America will reach 22
million by 2000, according to Pyramid Research Inc.  Its report,
"Cellular and PCS Markets in Latin America and the Caribbean,"
projects an annual growth rate of 40 percent between 1995 and 2000.
     The report claims that subscriber growth is outpacing all other
regions.  That surge is driven by tremendous growth in Brazil and
Colombia as well as continued growth in Mexico, Argentina and
Venezuela.  Privatization is racing through the region; non-basic
services including cellular are the first markets to open up, followed
closely by basic services markets, the study said.  Argentina, Chile,
Mexico, Peru and Venezuela have witnessed total privatization of their
telecom sectors.  To illustrate the penetration of competition into
these markets, the study takes note of how many competitors there are
in each.  Chile has four separate mobile phone operators, Colombia and
Argentina each have six and Mexico has 10.  In Central America (aside
from Mexico), where competitors are fewer, granting cellular operator
licenses is a top priority for governments.
     Operators serving Colombia were surprised by the demand, the
study said.  In the first nine months of operations of the cellular
networks in the country, subscribership totalled 150,000, which is
nearly half of what the operators had predicted Colombia would have in
five years.  Venezuela also was greeted with more demand than
expected, so much so that government officials are considering
licensing a third operator and speeding up the buildout of personal
communications service (PCS) networks.
     Demand is high even in markets that are not yet privatized.  For
example, in Brazil, where state-owned companies still maintain a
monopoly, the number of subscribers grew by an average of 283 percent
between 1991 and 1995.
     Why is demand so high?  Cellular often serves as a solution to
public networks unable to meet demand for telecom services. 
"Backlogged demand for basic service and heightened competition have
contributed to strong growth in the region's cellular markets," said
report author Linda Barrabee, a senior analyst at Pyramid Research. 
This demand also will benefit equipment vendors. Between 1995 and
2000, the market for cellular and PCS infrastructure is expected to
grow from $1.5 billion to $3.7 billion.  Digital equipment will
dominate in the equipment market for the region.  Revenue for digital
is expected to grow from $87 million in 1995 to more than $2.7 billion
in 2000.
     Proponents of time division multiple access (TDMA) and code
division multiple access (CDMA) technologies are battling for market
share as the region moves closer to a migration from analog to digital
networks.  Many countries have selected TDMA because it was available
first, but some of the larger markets--including Argentina, Brazil and
Mexico--have delayed their decisions until the next generation of the
TDMA and CDMA standards are available.  "Many of the larger markets
are serving as test-beds for a range of digital cellular ... standards
such as TDMA, CDMA, E[nhanced]-TDMA, and the GSM-based standard DCS-
1900," Barrabee said.  The migration to digital is inevitable because
the current demand for service cannot be met by analog systems.
     The total number of PCS subscribers will be 4 million by 2000. 
But Barrabee says that "cellular operators should not be threatened by
PCS operators in the short-term.  The window of opportunity is far
from closed.  After all, with or without PCS, by the year 2000, Brazil
will log on 9 million cellular subscribers, Argentina will top 2
million and Mexico will surpass 4 million."

COURT EXCUSES WTR's CARLO AND RESEARCH FIRM AS DEFENDANTS IN CANCER
LAWSUIT

      On Dec. 18, George Carlo, chairman of Wireless Technology
Research LLC (WTR), and the research firm he heads, Health and
Environmental Sciences Group Ltd. (HES Group), were dismissed as
defendants in a lawsuit alleging cellular telephones cause brain
cancer.  Motorola Inc., WTR (formerly known as the Scientific Advisory
Group), the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
and CTIA Senior Vice President-Public Affairs Ron Nessen are the
remaining defendants in the suit (MPN, March 13, 1995, pages 1-2). 
The judge is expected to deliver a written opinion deciding the matter
this month (January).
     Last March, plaintiff Debbra Wright alleged that use of cellular
phones had caused her benign brain tumor and that the defendants had
conspired to withhold information from the public about the alleged
connection between cellular phones and brain tumors.  The lawsuit,
filed with the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., is Debbra Wright v.
Motorola.  As a real estate manager for Bell Atlantic Mobile, Wright
said she used cellular phones from one to six hours per day between
February 1988 and March 1994.
     "[On Dec. 18] Illinois Judge Paddy McNamara ruled that even
though Wright had obtained a vast amount of information in the last
year about Dr. Carlo, HES Group and the scientific program that Dr.
Carlo is leading, she had not come forward with any evidence that Dr.
Carlo and HES Group were involved in the alleged conspiracy," said
James Baller, chief litigation counsel to Carlo, the HES Group and WTR
in the case.
     "Judge McNamara also is expected to rule in March 1996 on similar
charges [filed] by Wright in September directed specifically against
the independent scientific organization WTR," Baller said in a
statement.  "WTR believes that these allegations should also be
dismissed by Judge McNamara as they are based on the same key factual
issues the judge has now resolved.
     "WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are wasteful
attacks on the scientific community, that they slow completion of the
research necessary to answer the public's questions ... and that these
tactics could themselves pose threats to public health if they delay
implementation of any interventions that may prove necessary," Baller
said.
     "CTIA and the others have also filed a motion to dismiss and that
should be heard sometime early in the new year," said Nessen.  "Just
as the [motions of Carlo and HES Group] one by one have been dismissed
for lack of scientific evidence, we expect the court will also dismiss
this case."

SATELLITE EXECUTIVES LOOK AHEAD TO A BOOMING NEW YEAR
Even as Regulatory Challenges Remain, Rollout Activity to Accelerate

     If the optimism of many satellite executives is any indication,
look for the big winners of last year to consolidate their lead, while
those left behind in 1995 play an increasingly difficult game of
catch-up.
     And 1995 was a whirlwind year.  "The most significant development
was the emergence of mobile satellite communications as a major
satellite service," said Donald Cromer, president of Hughes Space and
Communications Co..
     "I expect we're going to see phenomenal growth, evidenced from
almost day one," added John Farrell, president of Canada's TMI
Communications.  TMI's MSat satellite is slated for launch in March.
     But despite some executives' positive outlook, regulatory issues
will remain a big variable as companies enter 1996.  "The true hurdle
of this business is not the market, not the technology.  It's regula-
tory," said Stephen Morgan, director-business development for Little
LEO Starsys Global Positioning Inc.     
     Indeed, although the recently concluded World Radiocommunication
Conference (WRC-95) eliminated much of the spectrum uncertainty that
has plagued the mobile satellite service (MSS) industry, the
conference is only a prelude to the global task of acquiring licenses
in individual countries.
     However, several observers doubted that the difficulties
encountered at WRC-95 will re-emerge in countries' licensing
proceedings.  "As far as I know, there's nothing that will affect the
licensing process," said Lloyd Rezler, managing director of satellite
services for Globalstar L.P. partner AirTouch Communications Inc..
     For the second-round Little LEOs, "a holding pattern is a good
analogy," Morgan said.  "Although the planes are moving, they're going
in circles while the traffic controllers work madly."  Any solution
will come at WRC-97, he said.
     But in a year which will bring launches including Inmarsat's
third- generation satellites, TMI's bird and the first Iridium Inc.
satellites, many expressed enthusiasm for 1996.  "This is going to be
an interesting year for us," said Barry Bertiger, director of Motorola
Inc.'s satellite communications division.  "First launches are always
exciting."
     The initial Big LEO launches "should serve as an indicator as to
how quickly and effectively these new systems can be brought online,"
observed industry consultant Ed Martin.
     However, the launch failures of 1995 do not bode well for the new
year.  "The failure rate has got to come down and stay down, or
ambitious plans like the Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. will have a
terrible time rolling out," said Tim Logue, space and telecom analyst
for Washington law firm Reid & Priest.
     But while groundbreaking companies such as Iridium and Orbital
Sciences Corp. prepare their initial or follow-on launches, others
plan significant preparatory deals for the first part of this year. 
Odyssey, the Big LEO backed by TRW Inc. and Teleglobe Inc., expects to
seal its strategic partners as well as handset and launch vehicle
plans beginning in the first quarter.
     Odyssey launch vehicle candidates include the Ariane, Long March,
Proton and Soyuz rockets, while TRW has letters of intent for handset
development with OSC's Magellan Systems Corp., Japan Radio Co. and
Panasonic Corp.
    Further, look for Starsys--which is about to close its acquis-
ition deal with GE American Communications Inc.--to award satellite,
launch vehicle and handset deals soon.The FCC's Internat- ional Bureau
has a full mobile agenda for 1996, although its work has been halted
by the federal government's shutdown.  Issues include its twice-
delayed satellite policy review, as well as its Ka-band rulemaking.  
    The three remaining Big LEOs, deferred last year for lack of
financing, also are slated for an FCC decision by Jan. 31., although
this may be delayed.  Ellipso has entered into talks with Rockwell
International Corp. , as well as Telstra Corp., Australia's largest
carrier, while Constellation Communications Inc. and American Mobile
Satellite Corp. have remained guarded.
    But even the current MSS leaders still have significant finance
work left.  However, the satellite industry's growth will ease
financing, Hughes' Cromer said.  "I believe financial backing will
continue to become available as more satellite programs are proven and
business cases are demonstrated," he said.  
    Overall, "It will be a year of realistic thinking," AirTouch's
Rezler said.  "The weaker companies just simply won't get the funding. 
The stronger companies will be facing the realities of implementation. 
[By year-end], it will be a very strong industry with respect to the
remaining competitors."

APMT COMES TOGETHER WITH STRONG CHINESE AND SINGAPOREAN BACKING

     Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT), the latest
addition to the Asian regional mobile satellite fray, revealed
significant support from Chinese and Singaporean companies in a
founders' agreement announced in late December.
    People's Republic of China organizations China Aero-Space Corp.
(CASC), China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, China
Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp. (managed by China's
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications) and China Unicom Satellite
Telecommunication Co. Ltd. are involved in the $640 million deal. 
Additionally, Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. have a one-third stake between them.
    APMT, incorporated in Singapore as APMT Satellite Pte. Ltd., will
be funded by its six founding members, with local service providers
expected to dilute founders' shares as they take equity stakes.   
    Asia Mobile Telecommunications (Thailand) has received Thai
regulatory approval and reportedly will take a 10 percent equity stake
in APMT.  Additionally, APMT also has joined with Japan's Mitsubishi
Corp., and is talking to potential partners in four other countries,
reported the South China Morning Post.
    APMT currently is evaluating turnkey space/ground segment bids; a
report from an Asian correspondent had Hughes Space and Communications
Co. entering into final negotiations.  Hughes officials had no
comment.

  ...Courting the Asian Tigers, Or a Three-Ring Circus?

    APMT will join two other regional MSS projects, as well as the
four global MSS ventures, to vie for Asian subscribers starting in
1998 to 1999 (MSN, Sept. 21, 1995, p. 3).  And despite some concerns
of overcapacity, MSS companies--all with relatively limited
capacities--will enter a booming Asian mobile arena.
    Indeed, a 1995 study by Economic and Management Consultants
International Inc. (EMCI) predicts 78.8 million Asian cellular
subscribers in 2000, up from 10.7 million in 1994.  Japan will remain
the largest market in 2000, at 32.3 percent, but China will move to
second-largest, at 26.8 percent, EMCI said.
    But despite a promising market, APMT's entry still may affect the
jockeying of its competitors to develop strategic relationships in
China, particularly among the global MSS companies.  
    Although having contracts in China isn't a precursor to doing
business there, "China very distinctly insists on some level of
participation, generally above and beyond providing services," said
Iridium Inc. spokesman John Windolph.
    Both Globalstar L.P. and Iridium have launch contracts with
state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corp.  Iridium also has a
relationship with Long March developer CASC--also an APMT partner--
which will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for Iridium
service in China.  
    But London's ICO Global Communications Ltd. has the strongest
ties of the global systems: China's Inmarsat Signatory Beijing Marine
Communication and Navigation Co. recently upped its equity commitments
in ICO to $103 million.
    Globalstar, through partner AirTouch Communications, still is
developing its Chinese connections.  "[China] is the only major
territory that's very much up in the air with respect to their inten-
tions," said Lloyd Rezler, AirTouch's managing director-satellite
services.
    One potential wrinkle as companies seek to boost their Asian ties
may be the uneasy political situation between China and Taiwan.  "So
far, that's not been an issue, and we're hoping that the development
won't become a political issue in that respect," said Rezler.  "It's a
win-win for everybody to have these systems up and running."
    Added Iridium's Windolph, "They are distinctly separate
territories, and consequently they are being treated as such."

WRC-95 OPENS THE DOOR

    The Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. both achieved strong results at
this year's World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95), held in
Geneva by the International Telecommunication Union.  Teledesic wound
up the surprise winner after a strong international campaign to raise
awareness of its system, while the Big LEOs capped off their success
at 1992's conference with solid feederlink allocations.  ICO Global
Communications Ltd. had some difficulties due to the crowded nature of
its 2 GHz bands, but succeeded in its primary goal: advancing the
global availability date of its spectrum to 2000.
    The Little LEOs had to contend with the challenges of little
preparation time for WRC-95 and spectrum scarcity in bands below 1
GHz.  However, they succeeded in a small global allocation--as well as
more bands in the Americas--and improved their recognition by other
countries.
    Overall, WRC-95 showcased growing regionalism among ITU member
countries.  Aside from the usually cohesive European bloc, the
countries of the Americas joined on many items, as did the African and
Arab regions to a lesser extent.  Although European unity may spur
other regions to join on issues, observers noted that regionalism also
may be the only way the ITU can function with the ambitious agendas
and accelerated, two-year schedule of the WRC meetings.

COMMERCIAL SERVICE:  AMSC AND ORBCOMM BREAK NEW GROUND

    Despite developmental activity on all MSS fronts, 1995 also
brought commercial rollouts from American Mobile Satellite Corp.  and
Orbital Sciences Corp..  OSC launched its first two Orbcomm birds in
April and currently is marketing non-real-time telemetry applications
until it launches the rest of the 36-satellite system next year.  In
turn, AMSC began Skycell commercial voice and data service at the end
of the year.
    Both companies' technical hangups prior to beginning service show
the challenge of setting up satellite systems, as well as the effect
start-up problems have on investor confidence.  AMSC's and OSC's
respective glitches prompted uncertain diagnoses from the companies,
while both stocks suffered on Wall Street.  But even as the two
companies opened the way to providing MSS from dedicated satellites,
Qualcomm Inc. aggressively boosted the international rollout of its
OmniTracs fleet management service.  After breaking 100,000 total
terminals sold by the first quarter, the company established a
Malaysian subsidiary and expanded its operations in Mexico and Brazil.

MSS COMPANIES WATCH THE BOOMING IPO AND BOND MARKETS FROM AFAR

    The strong results of initial public offerings (IPOs) and bonds
in 1995 offered no solace to MSS companies attempting to enter the
market.  Underwriters scaled back the Globalstar L.P. IPO prior to its
release, only to see the stock sink, while both it and Iridium Inc.
cited high costs in pulling their high-yield debt offerings.  MSS
companies' forays to the credit market show that exceptional risk
inevitably will bring demands for high returns.  
    On the equity side, the unestablished nature and nonexistent cash
flow of MSS companies give stock analysts few reference points.  But
Globalstar illustrated how news-driven MSS stocks are, when its solid
WRC-95 results pushed its stock price up more than 80 percent above
its pre-conference level.
    The exception to the MSS companies' public financing trials was
ICO, which parlayed its Inmarsat heritage into $1.4 billion in private
commitments, while satellite vendor Hughes Space & Communications also
invested $94 million.  Both Iridium and Globalstar also turned to
internal backers as well in the wake of their attempted debt
offerings.

LICENSING:  U.S. LEADS THE WAY, WHILE EUROPE CHOOSES ITS COURSE

    The Big LEO regulatory marathon of 1994 ended in January when the
FCC deemed Globalstar, Iridium and Odyssey qualified to build their
systems.  Look for a ruling on the deferred LEO systems, Ellipso,
Constellation and AMSC, next month.  Little LEOs Starsys Global Pos-
itioning Inc. and Volunteers in Technical Assistance gained licenses
in July and November, respectively.  Starsys ended its foreign
investment impasse with the FCC by dropping its French ownership to 20
percent, while satellite giant GE Americom bought 80 percent.  
    Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) adopted a proposal to
have a final MSS regulatory structure in Europe by March 1997. 
Although the process is incomplete, observers said it likely will be a
comparative-hearing proceeding, including spectrum availability and
reciprocal market access issues.  Separately, the EC's competitiveness
directorate requested commercial information from Globalstar, ICO and
Iridium to ensure "level playing fields" for MSS in Europe.  
The Asian Regional Market Shapes Up
    Along with strong Asian telecom and broadcast satellite activity-
-as well as high cellular growth--three new Asian regional MSS systems
arose in 1995.  These alternatives to the global systems prompted
concerns of MSS overcapacity in Asia, but optimists said the
potentially huge market may dwarf systems' capacities.  Given the
region's low teledensity and per capita income, look for the economics
of low cost equalling high volume to play heavily in any MSS shakeout.

SMALL LAUNCH VEHICLES STUMBLE; TRADE LIBERALIZATION WITH CHINA AND
UKRAINE

    The nascent small launch vehicle industry had a tough year, with
launch failures of OSC's Pegasus XL, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s [LMT]
LMLV 1 and EER Systems Inc.'s Conestoga.  Meanwhile, the United States
loosened restrictions on the use of Chinese and Ukrainian launch
vehicles.  Generally, the negotiations balanced existing contracts set
before the agreements--such as Globalstar's and Iridium's deals--and
overall "carrot and stick" trade relations, against the protests of
manufacturers such as McDonnell Douglas Corp..

EXPANSION INTO BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES

    Notwithstanding Teledesic's pre-WRC obstacles, broadband boomed
in 1995.  AT&T Corp., Lockheed Martin, Loral Corp. , and Motorola Inc.
all announced geostationary broadband plans, with the FCC's October
application deadline bringing the total field to 15 proposed systems. 
The FCC also took a step toward resolving a spat pitting satellite
companies against local multipoint distribution service (LMDS)
advocates, by proposing a Ka-band plan in July.  The plan stayed
intact through WRC-95; look for an order this year.

THE AUCTION OPTION

    The auction debate escalated in 1995, with issues including how
to allocate licenses fairly and accommodate spectrum scarcity. 
Congressional pressure for auctions was a factor, but key
congressional and FCC officials said international systems may be
outside the debate.  The issue was punted to the FCC's satellite
policy review, although the federal budget brawl delayed the first
industry roundtable.  In the midst of the debate, the Satellite
Industry Association emerged as an advocacy group for the oft-
fractious satellite industry.

ICO REGULATORY MISCELLANY:  PATENTS AND INVESTMENT CONCERNS

    The U.S. patent agency awarded patents for TRW Inc.'s Odyssey
system, an event which TRW said would preempt ICO's system.  While TRW
proceeded to file patent applications worldwide, the State and
Commerce Departments raised questions about the separation of ICO and
Inmarsat, as well as the propriety of Comsat Corp.'s investment in
ICO.  Both issues remain unresolved.

FIRST FIVE IRIDIUM SATELLITES ARE IN PRODUCTION; 1996 LAUNCHES
SCHEDULED

     Iridium Inc. is on course to be the first of the Big LEOs in
orbit, with five satellites currently in the factory and a launch
slated for the fourth quarter.
    Construction is now ahead of contractual schedule; Iridium
sponsor Motorola Inc. chose to continue its buildout plans despite
spectrum uncertainty prior to last year's World Radiocommunication
Conference (WRC-95).  "From a construction standpoint, things are
actually going quite well," said Barry Bertiger, Motorola corporate
vice president and general manager of its satellite communications
division.   
    Bertiger lauded Motorola's relationship with its Iridium
subcontractors.  There have been "a couple cost claims" on the fixed-
price development subcontracts, but they are "all very minor," he
said.  The main subcontractors are Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon
Co., and rocket manufacturers China Great Wall Industry Corp.,
Khrunichev and McDonnell Douglas Corp..
    Motorola has two qualification spacecraft built, as well as the
five flight models in its Chandler, Ariz., plant.  For the Iridium
project Motorola introduced a "five-day, dock-to-dock" timetable for
turning satellite components into a complete spacecraft.  Currently
the company is holding a seven-day cycle time for initial production,
with the five-day goal set to begin with the 20th of the initial 72
Iridium satellites and spares, Bertiger said.
    After the early production run, Motorola will defer construction
until results are in from the first flight tests.  Regarding manuf-
acturing changes ifnecessary, Bertiger said the production
line is "reasonably flexible.  Minor changes we can handle fairly
easily."
      In-orbit "tweaking" is also possible, since the satellites'
software is programmable, he added.  Iridium will begin in-orbit
testing with three satellites in one plane, to test crosslinks between
satellites and L-band and gateway links with the ground.  A second
launch of two satellites will enable plane-to-plane crosslink tests.   
 Despite Motorola's aggressive satellite construction campaign, the
development schedule for Iridium's novel dual-mode handheld phones
will not be a issue, Bertiger said.  "Fortunately, that's all under
one umbrella here," he said.  Motorola has a working handset
prototype--"not portable, but transportable," with plans for a few
hundred prototype portables by 1997, he said. 

Motorola Signs for Five More Delta Launches

     Last month, Motorola added a five-launch Delta 2 order to its
existing $400 million, eight-launch contract with McDonnell Douglas. 
The follow-on launches, of three satellites each, will replenish the
initial 66-satellite, six-spare Iridium constellation.  Launches of
replacement satellites or spares will begin in 1998 or 1999,
"depending on when we need the satellites up," said Stephanie Nowack,
Motorola Satellite Communications Division spokeswoman.

  ...Mac-Dac Develops New Delta Components to Handle Iridium Launches

    Building a launch vehicle fairing to hold five satellites is a
first for McDonnell Douglas, said Will Hampton, a program manager with
McDonnell Douglas.  To accommodate the Iridium satellites atop its
Delta 2 rocket, Mac-Dac created a new fitting to interface with the
second stage, as well as a new satellite dispenser.  Meanwhile, the
whole assembly will be encased in a new composite (rather than
aluminum) fairing.  The Iridium launch vehicle production is in the
existing Delta production flow and is on schedule, Hampton added.
    Motorola and McDonnell Douglas officials declined to give
specific dates for the first launch, although a manifest from the
Office of Commercial Space Transportation shows an Iridium launch
slated for September.
    Hampton said the satellites will arrive at the Vandenberg Air
Force Base launch facilities five weeks before launch.  The Iridium
program is "much more 
streamlined in terms of vehicle processing," he said.  "They've done
very impressive work in terms of the amount of time they've been able
to reduce."

  ...Globalstar Cutting Metal, While Odyssey and ICO Prepare

    Globalstar L.P. ICO Global Communications Ltd. and Odyssey, the
two other Big LEO consortia, also are proceeding with their satellite
development plans, although all are behind Iridium to varying degrees.
    Globalstar space segment manufacturer Space Systems/Loral has
built a prototype satellite, as well as basic elements of the flight
models, said Globalstar Executive Vice President Tony Navarra.  The
first flight model is due this fall, he said.  Navarra acknowledged
Iridium's progress, but said he expects Globalstar will be first to
market, since its system can operate (at reduced capacity) with only
32 satellites.  But regarding Iridium's groundbreaking launch, "We're
absolutely looking forward to it," he said.
    Meanwhile, Odyssey sponsor TRW Inc. and ICO (through its
satellite builder Hughes Space and Communications Co. remain embroiled
in their well-known squabble prompted by TRW's patents of the Odyssey
constellation.  
    Hughes is in the early stages of the recently awarded ICO
program, although satellite construction has not begun.  Regardless,
"We're not waiting for any patent considerations here," said a company
spokesman.
    In turn, TRW is concluding development of the Odyssey satellites'
internal propulsion, and has successfully tested the Odyssey L-band
antenna design.

DEFENSE MERGER WILL KEEP SATCOMS SEPARATE

     The $10 billion Lockheed Martin Corp.Loral Corp. merger announced
this week will keep the defense giants' satellite communications
businesses separate, the two companies said.  "Loral now will be a
leading space and communications company," said company Chairman
Bernard Schwartz in a statement outlining the merger.  The new Loral
Space and Communications Corp. will retain its 31 percent stake in Big
LEO Globalstar L.P., as well as its 33 percent stake in manufacturer
Space Systems/Loral (SS/L).  Additionally, Lockheed Martin will invest
$344 million for a 20 percent equity share of Loral Space.  However,
the two may find some commercial overlap.  While SS/L is the primary
builder of Globalstar's satellites (and owns 37.5 percent of
Globalstar), Lockheed Martin is leading the construction of Iridium
Inc.'s satellites.  On the broadband side, Loral and Lockheed Martin
have their respective Cyberstar and Astrolink projects.  Despite a
short day of trading due to a blizzard on the East Coast, Globalstar's
stock shot up 23 percent the day the merger was announced, reaching at
one point a high of $44.50 per share.  (Lockheed Martin, 301/897-

MIKE SYNAR DIES AT AGE 45

     Mike Synar, former Oklahoma Representative and ambassador-
designate of the U.S. delegation to last year's World
Radiocommunication Conference, died of cancer Jan. 9 at home in
Washington.  
     Synar embraced the technical issues of WRC-95 with the same self-
assured exuberance that typified his eight terms in Congress.  "I
think the principle that evolved our telecom system in Oklahoma must
guide us for WRC-95," he told Phillips editors in a 1995 interview. 
"And that is this:  We believe that the American telecommunications
products should be available at the same time, the same quality, the
same quantity, anywhere in the world."

MILSTAR SATELLITES' CROSSLINKS CHECK OUT; PARALLEL CONCEPT TO
IRIDIUM'S

     Lockheed Martin Corp. announced last month that the first two
Milstar geostationary satellites, built for the U.S. military, have
successfully relayed messages via their intersatellite links.
    Lockheed Martin billed the event as the first use of satellite
crosslinks; ordinarily, traffic is transferred between satellites by
"double-hopping" via ground stations.  When fully operational, the
Milstar system will relay high-priority voice, data and video traffic
to fixed, mobile and man-portable units.
    Several commercial systems have specified crosslinks in their
design, including Iridium Inc., the Motorola Inc.-sponsored Big LEO
that counts Lockheed Martin among its contractors.  "Iridium is based
somewhat on the technology developed for Milstar," said Lockheed
Martin spokesman Eric DeRitis. "It gave us the knowledge to produce
the crosslinks for Iridium."
    The parallel is not exact.  The two Milstar satellites (four more
will be launched, starting in 1999) relay traffic between their
respective central Pacific Ocean and continental United States orbital
slots, while Iridium only will send traffic through adjacent
satellites in its 66-satellite network.  Further, the Milstar
crosslinks operate at 60 GHz--for security, since stray signals are
absorbed by the atmosphere--while Iridium's crosslinks are at 28 GHz.
    "We've never been all that concerned about intersatellite links,"
said Barry Bertiger, general manager of Motorola's satellite
communications division.  "They're pretty straightforward point-to-
point microwave links."  The links have been fully tested on the
ground, he added.
    However, even the Milstar system does not have crosslinks between
satellites in different planes (and moving in different directions),
as Iridium does.

  ...Crosslinks Offer Security Advantages for the Milstar System 

    By using intersatellite links, the Milstar system reduces the
U.S. military's reliance on potentially vulnerable (and expensive)
ground stations outside the United States.  However, innovation comes
at a premium.  Unclassified funding for the Milstars and mission
control as of Sept. 30, 1994, was $6.4 billion, according to our
sister publication SPACE BUSINESS NEWS.
    Lockheed Martin designed Iridium's crosslinks, with Com Dev
manufacturing antennas and Gorca Systems Inc. providing systems
engineering.  Although crosslinks have obvious military benefits,
Iridium's have led its competitors, among others, to assert that it
will bypass local networks in routing calls to end users--a scenario
Iridium officials vehemently deny.  Iridium maintains that its network
is designed to interconnect with all existing telecom systems.

INTERACTIVE TV MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED

Although the promise of true interactive television still
captivates the public, analysts now believe it will take
longer to come to fruition than originally expected.
Recent interactive TV trials, including a 4,000 home
trial in Orlando, Fla., conducted by Time Warner, have
not gone as well as expected.  Analysts believe the
reasons include an immature system, a price point that
is too high for providers to make money, and a
marketplace that isn't quite ready to jump into
interactivity.

The nascent industry is still trying to overcome its
early boastful claims about the price and breadth of
services interactive TV would provide.  Analysts now say
those claims were blown out of proportion and caused
confusion in the marketplace.

Telephone and cable companies originally claimed that
interactive TV would be relatively easy to implement and
that it could be done in a cost-effective manner,
explained Jim Penhune, an analyst with BIS Strategic
Decisions (Norwell, Mass.).  "After a while, the
companies began believing their own claims and nobody
would admit that it would be harder to implement
technically and profitably than had originally been
believed," he said.

One stumbling block to fast adoption of interactive
television may be that consumers are not interested
enough or ready for interactive television in its current
incarnation.  As a result, the industry will have to
define a very low-cost entry point for interactive
television to become a reality soon, said Tom Maresca,
an analyst at Jupiter Communications (New York, N.Y.).

The level of sophistication of current interactive
television offerings also has been rather poor, which
doesn't endear consumers to the concept, said Walter
Miao, an analyst at Link Resources (New York, N.Y.).
Lack of standards and interoperability are other factors.
"TV viewers today are accustomed to being passive with
our TV sets.  The only thing that has even been a little
interactive up until now has been the remote control or
a video game," Miao explained.  "If interactive TV is
going to catch on, we need to define new levels of
interactivity, and we need to do it slowly.  You have to
start small, which is part of the mistake so far.  As
much as I admire Time Warner for putting in a full-
service network in Orlando, they are trying to do
everything.  That's a mistake, and it's expensive."

Starting small may mean creating an entry-level
interactive system just for games, Miao said.  "Show me
an interactive TV system I can just do shopping and
transactions on.  Then define that system as a scalable
system so I can scale it up from 20 to 200 households and
then to 2000 households.  Then I can start adding new
interactive services.  That's the way you can ratchet
things up."

The best way to deliver interactive television is to do
so incrementally, agreed Penhune.  "Reality is that more
limited forms of what we would call interactive TV will
deployed to more people over the next year or so.  We'll
see a scaled-down version of services.  You are going to
see more high-end pay-per-view TV from cable people and
near video-on-demand, where instead of being able to
choose any of 2,000 movies and run them instantly at any
time with stop, fast forward, and rewind, you will have
a choice of 50 to 100 movies, delivered at 15 minute
intervals.  The industry will see that there will be no
problem providing those types of services
cost-effectively."

THE FUTURE OF INTERACTIVITY

It may be that in the end, interactive television, the
Internet, and on-line services will all be melded
together.  "You are starting to see video and audio on-
demand on the Internet.  It is getting to the point where
it is starting to resemble TV more than it ever has
before," Maresca said.

Ten years from now, people probably will be accessing the
Internet in a much more robust fashion than via their TV
sets, "but this will be an Internet that has multimedia,
video, audio, and a heavy look and feel to it," Maresca
predicted.  Many of the services that are starting to be
done over the Internet now, including banking and
shopping, will most likely grow, and those same types of
applications eventually can be extended to the television
environment, he said.

The industry will have to mature a little more before
consumers can receive interactive television services
they will value at a cost they will pay, Miao added.  And
today's world is primarily an analog world, while
interactivity is best suited to a digital world.  These
factors mean that the beginnings of true interactive
television probably won't happen until at least the end
of 1996, Miao said.

ATM, ETHERNET WILL COEXIST IN THE SHORT TERM

LONG TERM UNCERTAIN:  IN THE SHORT TERM, ANALYSTS EXPECT
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Ethernet each to
have a secure place in the networking arena because each
serves a unique purpose.  On the desktop, Ethernet is the
clear protocol of choice, both in terms of efficiency and
price, said John Morency, an analyst at The Registry, a
consultancy in Newton, Mass.

Ethernet on the desktop, both at 10 megabits per second
(Mbps) and 100 Mbps, has a bright future, Morency said.
Fast Ethernet meets the capacity demand and appears to
have the support of virtually all of the major hub
vendors, including Cabletron, Bay Networks, and 3Com.
Most people will continue to deploy Ethernet to the
desktop because it is most cost-effective to do so, said
Dave Passmore, an analyst at Decisys (Sterling, Va.), a
network consulting firm.

Ethernet on the desktop also is popular because users do
not have to worry about support for ATM LAN emulation.
"All the current software people run on their desktop
machines today assumes a broadcast LAN environment like
Ethernet, and if you go to ATM, you open a Pandora's box"
of LAN emulation with ATM, the standard for which is
relatively new, Passmore explained.  But when it comes
to linking Ethernet switches together, ATM comes into
play.  Decisys sees ATM as the backbone to link those
switches together.

Just as Ethernet seems to have a lock on the current
desktop, ATM is currently best suited to the backbone,
or the pipe that provides quality of service along
multiple virtual connections, allowing the user to
process voice, video, and data simultaneously.  For the
next three years, Passmore advised counting on ATM as the
backbone to tie routers and switches together.

ATM prices are declining fairly rapidly, which bodes well
for the technology, said Mordechai Fester, ATM product
manager for Cisco Systems.  "In some situations, that
could make it tougher for Ethernet.  You could easily
imagine a scenario where if ATM had stayed at $2,000 per
server the way it was a year or two ago, people would be
delaying implementation of ATM and might favor another
technology," he said.

More important than declining prices for ATM is the
rollout of the next generation of ATM switching.
Production-ready ATM backbone switches will hit the
market this year, prompting many companies to move to ATM
as a mainstream backbone technology, Fester said.

ATM on the desktop will happen eventually, but don't
expect to see it in most commercial organizations until
the year 2000 at the earliest, Passmore predicted.

"We really don't see desktop ATM really taking off to any
significant extent in 1996," agreed Morency.  "Technology
will still be too expensive and there isn't going to be
real interoperability to exist to make network managers
feel comfortable enough.  It will take time for it to
really mature."

1997 AND BEYOND

Although 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps Ethernet have their place,
something much faster is on the horizon.  Gigabit
Ethernet will supply full-duplex fiber links over 20
kilometers; a copper version will cover shorter
distances.  Although the impact of Gigabit Ethernet on
the market in 1996 is negligible, it may take off in
1997, when the specification is expected to be released.
Gigabit Ethernet is still quite new, and it isn't clear
whether it will meet distance limitations, Passmore said.
"Today, if you are going to the trouble of putting fiber
in to give you any kind of distance, you might just as
well use ATM," he said.

When Gigabit Ethernet finally arrives, it may give ATM
a run for its money.  But because ATM has been around
longer and is more firmly entrenched, it may win out,
Passmore speculated.  Ethernet is more of a known
quantity on the desktop, though, and users may turn to
it.  "They might not like the idea of moving to a totally
new technology, therefore choosing the safety and
familiarity of Ethernet," Morency said.

"If we are at the point next year where ATM LAN emulation
really hasn't taken off, ATM desktop connectivity is
still too expensive and not very interoperable, there may
be a lot of shops that may look to Gigabit Ethernet to
provide a short-term tactical implementation to get the
advantage of higher performance," he said.

1996 MAY BE BIGGEST YEAR YET FOR VIDEOCONFERENCING

Bill Gates, who has as many opinions as he has millions,
has said that videoconferencing, although a promising
technology, cannot compete with personal contact.  "A
face-to-face meeting is still a better way to collaborate
than the most ideal videoconferencing solution," he has
said.

For once, analysts agree with Gates.  But although
nothing can compete with a face-to-face meeting, it isn't
always possible or practical.  In those cases,
videoconferencing may be an ideal solution, especially
as the technology matures and standards designed to
support it are put into place.

1996 will be the year videoconferencing comes into its
own, predicted Sarah Dickinson, president of Dickinson
and Associates (Cambridge, Mass.), a videoconferencing
consulting firm.

More and more companies are entering the
videoconferencing market, and as large companies become
more involved, the market will begin to accelerate, said
Tony Paradiso, director of marketing in PictureTel's
personal systems division.  PictureTel has a 50 percent
market share, but it is smaller than many of its
competitors.  A growing installed base of PC users and
large companies like Intel and British Telecom, which
have recently entered the market, will help bring
visibility to the technology.  Such large companies help
educate the market and help accelerate the technology's
acceptance, Paradiso said.

STANDARDS WILL HELP ACCEPTANCE... AND PRICE

As standards for videoconferencing loom on the horizon
and the technology becomes simpler and less expensive,
the videoconferencing market will grow more quickly,
analysts believe.

The standard that will have the largest effect on
videoconferencing's expected boom is H.324, which will
create an integration of videoconferencing within the
domain of the home PC, Paradiso explained.  Approved last
month, H.324 is the standard everyone will build to, he
said.  It will force the quality of video to improve and
prices to become dramatically lower, and will foster
interest by the consumer market.

H.324 also will allow videoconferencing to be used with
regular telephone lines, but the jury is still out on
whether people are going to be interested in using
videoconferencing that way, Dickinson said.  Most
importantly, H.324 will bring videoconferencing into a
mobile environment for laptops and business travelers.
That capability is critical to widespread acceptance, she
said.

Another standard crucial to widespread acceptance of
videoconferencing is H.323, which allows for
videoconferencing over a local area network.  H.323 will
makes video over the LAN a very popular application,
Dickinson predicted.  It is expected to be approved by
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) by the
end of this year.  And on the horizon is a planned
standard for videoconferencing for ATM, currently being
discussed at the ITU.

Such standards will lead to cost decreases, predicted
Paradiso.  "In the past, AT&T and other companies had
videophones, but they were $1,500, [they had] terrible
quality, and they were proprietary," he explained.  "But
with these standards, two videoconferencing users can buy
equipment from two different vendors.  You will begin
seeing PC vendors adding videoconferencing capabilities
to their platforms, and you will be able to do video over
standard phone lines.  All of this will bring the prices
down and availability up."

Last on the standards list is T.120, the information-
sharing piece ratified in 1995.  Although some vendors
claim compatibility, take that claim with a grain of
salt, warned Steve Kimball, an analyst with META Group
(Reston, Va.).  "They have probably tested it on their
own products, but haven't tested it yet with different
vendors' products.  It will be more toward the second
half of 1996 that T.120 compliance really gets
addressed," he said.

BY THE NEW MILLENNIUM

Videoconferencing over the Internet also is an important
advance, Dickinson said.  Products like Apple's QuickTime
conferencing kit will give users videoconferencing
capabilities over the Internet using TCP/IP or regular
Ethernet LAN and at the higher end, over ISDN.  This
capability will attract a new group of users, which is
crucial for the technology's continued success, she said.

As the decade progresses, widespread adoption of
videoconferencing by businesses will become more likely,
Kimball said, but it will take a few years for businesses
to realize enough benefit from the technology and for the
technology to become more affordable.  "If it becomes
cheap enough that it doesn't matter whether it is
installed [in PCs] or not, then all of a sudden people
get used to communicating that way.  At that point, he
said, it will become a commodity.

MSNBC BRINGS MICROSOFT ONE STEP CLOSER TO TECHNOLOGY
DOMINATION

Last month, Microsoft and NBC struck a deal to create a
news service that will inform viewers across broadcast,
cable and the Internet.  The revolutionary news service,
dubbed MSNBC, is designed to take advantage of NBC's
newsgathering expertise and Microsoft's strength in
computer technology, both through its software and its
fledgling on-line service, Microsoft Network.

As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said when the deal was
announced, people want to be able to call up news on
demand at their convenience.  While watching breaking
news on television, consumers want to be able to get
access to more in-depth information on items of interest.
The deal with NBC will help create innovative interactive
news content and an integrated media experience, he
explained.

The deal calls for Microsoft to invest $220 million over
five years for a 50 percent stake in the all-news cable
station.  Both Microsoft and NBC will invest $200 million
over five years to fund the cable channel and a
supporting on-line service.

Areas of special interest for Microsoft include
interactive television and on-line computer services,
both of which will be incorporated into the MSNBC
venture.

Gates apparently wanted to enter the news business very
badly: when a deal to acquire a large stake in Turner
Broadcasting Service went awry last August, Microsoft got
back in the saddle and spent the next several months
contemplating and executing a plan to get what it wanted.
With the MSNBC deal, it may have done just that.

A BETTER PLAN

The MSNBC venture is a much better way to go than
Microsoft's previous idea, which was to form its own news
organization, said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with
Arlen Communications Inc. (Bethesda, Md.).  Microsoft had
hired more than 20 reporters, who would form the genesis
of what might have been Microsoft's unique news
organization.

But the current plan allows Microsoft to have a buffer.
"Not only does Microsoft get to provide state-of-the-art
news, but it also doesn't get taken to task as a news
agency, which might have been very difficult from a
corporate point of view," Krasilovsky said.

The MSNBC venture will have to prove that there is a
market for people who want to customize this type of
information, said Peter Bernstein, president of
InfoNautics Consulting Inc. (Ramsey, N.J.).  "I think
there is a small segment of the population that would be
interested in doing that, but the question is whether
they will be willing to pay a stiff price for it," he
said.  "Will the perceived value be there for the service
to get the kind of penetration it will need to be
successful?"

At this point, it is difficult to envision that people
who are accustomed to getting information one way will
change their behavior so radically as to heavily use the
service MSNBC plans to provide, Bernstein said.  "But
Microsoft and NBC have plenty of money, and if they want
to back it to the extent that it will probably need to
be backed to change people's behavior, they can do it.
It's a question of marketing, and Microsoft has proven
itself very good at marketing."

By entering into this deal, Microsoft is covering all
bases, trying to position itself as a premier content
provider.  This agreement, along with Microsoft Network
and Microsoft's strong interest in interactive
television, is Microsoft's move into the real-time
content business.  "They honestly believe that content
is going to be king in the future," and Microsoft wants
to own a large part of that empire, Bernstein said.

Content is key, agreed Jim Penhune, an analyst with BIS
Strategic Decisions (Norwell, Mass.).  Microsoft has made
many alliances for content, including the defunct deal
with Turner Broadcasting and its relationship with SKG
Dreamworks.

A STEPPING STONE TO INTERACTIVE TV?

Some say that providing on-demand news is an interim step
toward gaining a foothold in the interactive television
market.  Microsoft is hoping that MSNBC will be the
interactive TV vehicle for news information, some
believe.

"You can't go wrong with content because all of it is
fairly leveragable," Penhune explained.  "A year ago, or
even now, there is a lot of talk about [deals like this]
giving Microsoft content for interactive TV.  But even
if it doesn't, it gives them content for all these other
media as well, so it isn't like they are going to be
stuck with something they can't use."

Although projects like the MSNBC venture take plenty of
Microsoft's energy and money, they will not distract
Microsoft from its core projects, Penhune said.  Those
core projects are all targeted at the consumer market,
"and if you accept the premise that they are consumer-
and not business-oriented, then doing something like this
is not a distraction.  It is another way of addressing
the consumer market," he said.

STRATACOM UNVEILS ATM SVC SWITCHING

StrataCom last week announced full support of high
performance switched virtual circuit (SVC) switching to
automate connection set-up and configuration.

ATM SVCs provide three benefits for carriers and end
users: scalability, flexibility and ease of use.  The
company said it expects to begin beta testing of ATM SVCs
with select customers in the first quarter of this year.

In addition, StrataCom unveiled a set of ATM signaling
and security features that give users more flexibility
and various levels of control across ATM wide area
networks.  The new features are designed to give
companies the ability to prevent unauthorized access
among users.

Available as a system software upgrade, StrataCom's ATM
SVCs will support ATM user-to-network (UNI) interfaces
ranging from T1/E1 (1.544/2.0 Mbps) and T3/E3 (45/34
Mbps) to OC-3/STM-1 (155 Mbps). StrataCom ATM SVC
signaling also includes compliance with both ATM UNI 3.0
and 3.1 with translation between these standards.

The company also said it will support ATM SVC signaling
for ATM Frame UNI (FUNI) and ATM Inverse Multiplexed
(AIMUX) interfaces with the delivery of these products
in the first quarter of 1996.  It will also support the
Interim Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol (IISP) which
provides interoperability with other vendor's ATM
switches and the Interim Local Management Interface
(ILMI) protocol for ATM connection management.

Unlike frame relay, ATM is widely viewed as the
underlying transport technology for multiple
services -- making ATM SVCs fundamental in supporting
large numbers of users and high volumes of traffic.  SVCs
are the foundation for several new ATM-based services
such as LAN interworking over ATM using LAN Emulation and
Multi-Protocol Over ATM (MPOA) standards.  These services
will require the ability to rapidly establish and
tear-down large numbers of connections.

While permanent virtual circuits or PVCs must be pre-
established and manually configured, SVCs make use of ATM
signaling information within each ATM cell allowing
connections to be automatically set up on-demand by
switches as ATM calls are requested by the user.

ATM SVCs provide an ideal foundation for multimedia
applications, according to Stratacom.  While router
architectures aggregate many users' traffic, the use of
ATM SVCs permits a separate connection for each pair of
users and each application.  This allows quality of
service guarantees which are essential for multimedia
communications.

Though PVCs remain attractive for customers with a
limited number of interconnected devices, as many more
users come online -- as is evidenced by the growth of the
Internet -- SVCs become a critical requirement.  SVCs
significantly reduce network administration by
eliminating manual configuration of connections while
increasing the flexibility by which devices can be added
to the network providing quicker connectivity to all
other devices.

The company is working on enhancements designed to scale
SVC capacity per switch to support millions of concurrent
SVC connections and thousands of SVC call set-ups per
second.

VIDEOSERVER ANNOUNCES MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCE SERVER

VideoServer Inc., a provider of H.320-based multipoint
control units (MCU), announced availability of a new
member of its Multimedia Conference Server product family
targeted at large corporate users and service providers.

MCUs mix audio and switch video signals to each
conference endpoint, allowing each participant to see
anyone else in the conference and hear the complete
discussion.  Multipoint technology is critical for
multimedia conferences to approach the efficiency and
flexibility of face-to-face meetings, minus the high
travel costs.  Without an MCU, multimedia conferences are
limited to only two sites, hindering effectiveness as
virtual meetings.

The dual-bus Model 2020 is the most powerful offering in
VideoServer's Series 2000 family, which ranges from
entry-level MCUs to high-capacity units.  With
high-capacity, dual-bus design, the new model is targeted
at large corporate sites and conference service
providers, supporting up to 32 sites using internal
inverse multiplexers (IMUX) in 336 Kbps or 384 Kbps
conferences.

Most cost effective for large corporate videoconferencing
network usage charges dominate the life cycle cost of any
videoconferencing solution.  Over a five-year life cycle,
it's not uncommon for these charges to exceed equipment
costs by a factor of ten to one.  The challenge for
videoconferencing managers, then, is to deploy conference
networks that use MCUs to minimize network charges and
will scale with future demand.

While small, distributed MCUs keep phone costs down in
low-volume scenarios, large corporate facilities benefit
from large, centralized MCUs.  For organizations with
more than three or four hours of videoconferencing
between any two sites each day, running leased T1 or E1
lines from each remote site to a centrally located Model
2020 yields substantially lower network costs than
switched digital services.  In addition to lower overall
network costs provided by leased lines in higher volume
scenarios, the cost of conferences between satellite
offices that are connected through the centrally-located
Model 2020 is essentially free.  Management costs also
drop when the MCU is centralized.

FIRST VIRTUAL UNVEILS DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA COLLABORATION
PRODUCTS

First Virtual Corp. announced several products targeted
at business users interested in desktop multimedia
collaboration.

The company's FIRST-Multimedia Switches deliver ATM to
the desktop at switched Ethernet prices, according to the
company.  The family is built with a "stackable/modular"
architecture allowing for a variety of scalable
configurations and can scale to support eight to 24 users
per switch; 120 users per stack and can further provide
scalability through the backbone.

The cost is $300 per 25 Mbps ATM port.  The switches are
support multimedia through modular options including: 25
Mbps ATM for the desktop, Ethernet, token ring for LAN
access, and 155 ATM OC3 for server or backbone switch
access.

The switch complies with ATM Forum UNI 3.0 and 3.1
Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) signaling and LAN
emulation standards to ensure interoperability with
existing LAN data applications and other vendors' ATM
products.

The ATM telecom gateway has been enhanced to include
PRI/TI support.  The Gateway Server is an ATM-Telecom
Gateway which distributes high-quality, remote H.320
videoconferencing streams from the Telco WAN to the
desktop over a local ATM network.  It adds
high-performance ISDN PRI and T1 WAN rates, enabling
room-system quality wide-area videoconferencing and
greater capacity for multimedia traffic and users.

The FIRST-WWW Server enables Internet users to cache
data, graphics and video streams off of the web in the
FIRST-Multimedia Storage Server.  This storage cache
helps facilitate fast access and high quality playback
by users on the ATM or LAN network.  Users can store and
share commonly-used video streams, as well as documents
that incorporate video, data and images using standard
Internet browsers.

In addition to being a QoS manager for out-of-the-box
applications running over ATM, MOS now enables live video
streams to be encoded into MPEG-1 real-time, then
distributes them to various desktops within the
organization using ATM's point-to-multi-point features.
PC users can receive high-quality, broadcast video while
performing any network activity.

FIRST-H.320 introduces development capabilities, via a
Software Developers Tool Kit (SDK) for store and forward
of H.320 streams. This will allow applications such as
Video-Mail and Video Session storage.  Videoconferencing
users will have the same benefits as voice mail users,
namely, the ability to leave a video message.

Net.January: We look at the future of the Web, and ponder the online gender
gap


The beginning of the year is a traditional time to think about
the future, and in the net biz we have more than a little future
to look forward to. In four years, we'll have reached the millenium
a nice round number that's as good a place as any to aim for.

We sent Karen Heyman out to talk to a bunch of Smart People
about what the Web will look like in the year 2000. Everyone
had their own ideas, but they all agreed on two things: that
the Web is here to stay, and that it will look nothing like
what we've got today. The story's called "Web 2000," and it
starts on page 52.

You've Got Mail

But for now, we're still dealing with the net as we know it
and for most of us, that means e-mail. Kevin Reichard surveyed
the world of Windows and Mac e-mail clients, and found a lot
of excellent programs for not a lot of money. "Push the E-Mail
Envelope," starting on page 60, tells you what we picked as
the best of a good lot.

Weaving a Web

The first question about the Web is generally, "How do I write
my own home page?" The second (and more important) question
is usually, "Where do I put my page so people can see it?"

The three biggest online services have been slow to let their
users become part of the Web. That's changed, as America Online,
CompuServe and Prodigy now give their clients Web space and
a simple non-HTML means to create pages.

Of course, neither all pages nor all online services are created
equal. Frequent contributor Joel T. Patz clues us in on which
one is best. The story about "Pre-Fab Home Pages" starts on
page 76.

Women Online

One of the enduring questions about online life is where all
the women are. The latest survey shows that about one-third
of the people online are female, but that's significantly less
than the half of the population that are women. Judith Broadhurst,
an expert in the field of women online, spoke to many women
some connected, some not-and got them to explain what it is
they're looking for. "Bridging the Gender Gap" starts on page
84.

Net Mail: The Ones That Got Away


In the November 1995 issue of NetGuide, you provided a rather
comprehensive review of the more popular and current versions
of browsers ("New Directions for Browsers," page 56). Why not
follow up with something about the grandfather of them all
 NCSA Mosaic and Cello. These two browsers have been around
for quite some time. They are not as flashy as Netscape, but
they will work on the millions of computers manufactured before
1995 that have been sold with 4 MB of RAM or even less.

Howard Bingham

Houston

I didn't see any mention of CompuServe's Spry Mosaic in the
article and wasn't sure what that means. I'm also confused
about the term "Mosaic" when it's used by itself or as "Spry
Mosaic." Is this the same browser?

Jack Galloway

Snohomish, Wash.

I was dismayed to discover that you did not include OS/2 WebExplorer
in your survey of Web browsers. I would have liked to see how
it stacked up against the several Windows/Mac browsers you
did include in your review. WebExplorer has been available
for a year now. What are you waiting for?

Charles Henrich

New York

NCSA's "Mosaic" was the first graphical browser in widespread
use, and its core technology was licensed widely in early 1995.
That's why so many browsers have the name Mosaic, even though
they're evolving in very different directions. That confuses
you, and it confused us. Spry Mosaic accidentally dropped out
of our November roundup; we did, however, review it in December
as part of the excellent Mosaic In A Box.

NCSA Mosaic and Cello didn't appear because they are now second
tier products whose technology has been passed by. We didn't
include WebExplorer because there is no other major browser
for the OS/2 platform; if you're running OS/2, you don't have
much of a choice, and if you're not using OS/2, WebExplorer
isn't enough of a reason to change your mind.

Net Mail: Sharing Wares


In "Party Girl Lets Loose on the Net" (October 1995, page 29),
Ron Bel Bruno refers to the software program CU-SeeMe as a
"public-domain shareware program." Being a shareware author
myself, I find it astounding that two very different types
of software would be combined into one. I suppose that "public
domain shareware" is something akin to "military intelligence"
and "journalistic research," no?

CU-SeeMe is freeware, but its copyright is held by Cornell University.

Net Mail: No Integration?



As one who came to the Internet through one of those user-friendly,
convenient online services, I have recently been surprised
to discover an almost complete lack of integrated software
for accessing the Internet. It seems to me that one or more
software engineers would recognize this as a golden unserved
market niche and dive in with a new product, yet I continue
to be told that no integrated suite or all-Internet "front
end" exists. Frankly, this is astonishing to me.

the U.S. Postal Service to destroy.

Net Mail: Columny


The last paragraph in Mark Eckenwiler's Net.Law column (November
1995, page 39) says that it should trouble us all that a person
served with a subpoena would have to choose between self-incrimination
and contempt of court. How about being honest and telling the
truth? What really troubles me is that because the criminal
conspirators of the example were co-workers, we're supposed
to bend the law and become co-conspirators to help them get
away with their crimes. Honest people don't have to lie or
worry about self-incrimination.

Herb Zieman

I commend Dan Rosenbaum for his use of the immigrant metaphor
in his November 1995 column on the new wave of Internet users
(page 17). I found it both apt and imaginative. However, there
is another source of hostility that will continue to exist
on the net that has far less to do with the clash between new
and old than it does with the human animal.

The Internet is the great equalizer of this era, and we are
all potential Davids against our perceived Goliaths. People
lash out on the Internet because they can-because they are
insulated and safe behind their screens-and this is an unfortunate
by-product of an otherwise indispensable form of communication.

But I suppose this is simply another example of the Internet
paradox: Just as the system unites us, it keeps us very much
apart.

Net Mail: Immorality in Cyberspace



I would like to congratulate the authorities who caught those
responsible for trafficking child porn and seducing minors
online ("FBI Thwarts E-mail Porn Ring," December 1995, page
21). It is those [people] who give online services and the
Internet a bad name. While I believe in free expression on
the Internet, I also believe that it's an absolute disgrace
to abuse this exciting technology. Once again, the crimes of
a few are ruining it for the rest of us.

Brian Hedden

Old Bridge, N.J.

In response to a letter written by Stephen W. Nicholas in the
November 1995 issue (page 11), I must say that Mr. Nicholas,
who claims we must "prevent the tyranny that comes from too
much freedom," seems to be barking up the wrong tree.

What is "frightening" about "the fact that the average citizen
has access to a numbingly vast amount of information"? Free
information access sets humans free from any oppressors.

Government regulation will not prevent immorality from invading
cyberspace. The only way to have nothing to fear is to educate
people to understand their fears and to take individual action
to protect against them.

Net.Editor: The current coarsening of the net has little to do with newbies

By:
Dan Rosenbaum

Is there really an online community? Assuming there is, I sometimes
wonder if I really want to be a part of it.

Depending on whose abacus you use, there are either about 8
million, 15 million, or 20 million of us online geeks in the
United States. As far as the worldwide Internet population
is concerned, you'll probably get a shrug for an answer, but
an estimate of 30 million seems fair.

That's a lot of people-on the scale of New York, Mexico City,
or Tokyo. Populations like that are in a weird netherzone.
They're not big enough to make a serious demographic dent.
A television show with 8 million viewers, for instance, is
on the fast track to cancellation. But 8 million people can
make a lot of noise, especially when they're equipped with
computers and modems.

It's the noise that worries me. There's always been a certain
amount of noise on the net, a side attraction to the great
information that's available for the mining. The noise level
rose and fell with the season (early fall and midwinter were
usually the worst), but it was generally possible to ignore
or tolerate it.

In the last year, the noise level has risen dramatically. Spams
and e-mail bombing are a weekly occurrence. What was once the
occasional appearance of a chain letter has become an unremitting
cadence. Constant struggles continue between regular participants
of some newsgroups and those people who seem intent in drowning
out the group's charter simply because they have a spare week.

This behavior is not new. I have fond memories of the "cats"
conference in the earliest days of the BIX online service,
which devolved quickly and hilariously (if somewhat tastelessly)
into a debate between cat fanciers and cat haters. Perhaps
the exact point is that the same people were frequently on
both sides of the "battle." In this particular case, the noise
was the signal.

Not very long ago, any material that was even remotely salacious
or offensive would be "rot-13"-ed, the letters substituted
for others 13 letters away: "a" becomes "n," "b" becomes "o."
"Sheesh" becomes "furrfu," and vice versa. (Try it, it's fun!)
Newsreaders could translate a posting into a rot-13ed text
with a single keystroke, protecting even the daintiest sensibility.
Yet, anyone could read such a posting if desired.

Rot-13 still exists on Usenet, but its use is now nearly archaic.
People just post what they want to say. The rights of the person
who might not want to see something inappropriate or upsetting
have been almost totally overtaken by the rights of a poster
hell-bent on free expression.

I'm hardly the only person worried about this. You may or may
not realize that the technical basis for the Internet is a
series of Requests for Comments that have been circulated widely,
discussed, and agreed upon. RFCs are what make the net work.
Most of them deal with abstruse technical questions of data
communications and message formatting. But there is now an
RFC 1855, which attempts to codify netiquette. Created by Sally
Hambridge at Intel, RFC 1855 is a lengthy and detailed discussion
of the dos and don'ts of the net. It is so detailed, in fact,
that most newbies will never hear about it and never read it.

There's another problem with RFC 1855: The coarsening of the
net has little to do with newbies. It's not newbies who crosspost
chain letters across the world. It's not newbies who take over
newsgroups. It's not newbies who set electronic robots loose
to cancel posts they deem "wrong." It's sophisticated users,
operating sophisticated tools, who are making the net a worse
place to be.

Of course, it's the rowdies who often affect how a community
is perceived. If a town is full of graffiti, or if the grass
on the highway berms is unkempt, the town will look neglected,
and reality will usually follow the perception.

That's why I'm so worried about the future of The WELL.

The WELL-Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link-has long been one of the
special places on the net. It can trace its lineage directly
back to the Community Memory project, in which customers of
the San Francisco-area Whole Earth stores could type essays,
thoughts, commentaries, or just plain ramblings into strategically
placed computer terminals.

Other people could respond to those postings, or start off on
entire new topics of their own. It was an experiment in interactivity,
in community, in communications. A commercial success it was
not. But Community Memory was an important piece of the mosaic
that became the online world.

One of the great things about The WELL-perhaps the single greatest
thing-is its clientele. Among its several thousand customers
are the very people making the electronic revolution happen.
It's a notoriously tough audience: Know what you're talking
about when you post, or you risk getting reduced to cinders.
On the other hand, The WELL's conferences read like a history
of online communication. It was the place where Time magazine's
notorious cyberporn story got debunked, and it's one of the
places that helped track down hacker Kevin Mitnick.

It used to be hard to get to The WELL. It's in the San Francisco
Bay Area, and for the longest time it required a long-distance
call if you weren't in the neighborhood. Even after the service
allowed access over the Internet via Telnet, The WELL remained
steadfastly terminal-based. No graphical interfaces here. If
you wanted to participate in a conference, you had to learn
an admittedly arcane command structure. The users seemed to
like it that way. Keeps out the bozos, they said.

But this past fall, The WELL introduced a new interface based
on the World Wide Web. Now, for $5 a month, you can fire up
your Web browser and dive in. The WELL is now simple and uncomplicated
even if the users are still a tough audience.

But if The WELL becomes easy to use, easy to get to, and easy
to afford, what's to keep it from getting overrun by the same
vandals who seem intent on ruining the rest of the net? Are
we on the verge of losing one of our special places?

The folks at The WELL say no. What will protect them, they say,
is their sense of community. That doesn't mean keeping out
all outsiders. Quite the opposite; they seem to believe strongly
in the need for new blood I wrote about in this space two months
ago.

The answer, they say, lies in the concept of community. It's
absurd to believe that 20 million people form any sort of community
just because they happen to inhabit the same non-space. In
some ways, I have more in common with the person who works
in the office next to mine than I do with my upstairs neighbor;
in other ways, the reverse is true.

We all belong to many communities, and the ones defined by proximity
or distance have become for many of us-particularly those of
us who are online-the least important. If a community is best
defined as a group of people with a common interest, the net
is awash with overlapping communities. And communities defend
themselves.

This is not necessarily a popular concept online. More than
once, I've seen angry exchanges between people who post inappropriately
and someone trying to correct them. Inevitably, the original
poster will send a sentence like, "Who appointed you the Net
Police?" At that point, of course, most useful discourse between
the parties in question has ended.

But the question is worth following. We're all the net police.
We all need to defend our online communities against the thoughtless
and destructive elements who are undeniably there. The net
is not some anarchic outpost where people can do what they
want. Its very existence is predicated on and depends upon
cooperation. If the larger online community of more than 30
million is to survive, people in the smaller communities will
have to stand tall and take the necessary measures to keep
their areas the way they want them.

You would do as much in your home, you would do as much where
you work, and you would do as much in your town. If you believe
in the online community, you need to do as much on the net.@

Net.News: Been Scammed? How to Avoid Becoming an Online Sucker

By:
Cynthia Kurkowski

Ever wonder how you could still mail a first-class letter using
a 2-cent stamp? Or how you could repair a bad credit record
by just paying the right people? Such bogus claims are the
stuff of which online scams are made.

Whether its investment fraud, money-making pyramids, illegal
credit repair offers, or even false software reseller fronts,
the net's shadowy anonymity is a real lure for scam artists.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, frauds commonly
appear as classified advertising or forum or bulletin board
notices. These postings are disguised as testimonials about
the quality and performance of a particular product or service.
Unscrupulous marketers even use chat rooms to pose as "satisfied
customers" who extol the virtues of fraudulent goods and services.

Thankfully, the same warning signs of a shady deal that you'd
look for in the physical world also apply to online scams.
Exaggerated claims, urgent sale closing deadlines, promises
of quick and easy profits, disclosures of insider trading information,
and unsubstantiated claims are a few of these dead giveaways.
In fact, the FTC's Web page at http://www.ftc.gov/ lists these
and more tips on how to distinguish a scam.

"It's in a new forum, [but] the old rules still apply," says
Lynn Collins, spokeswoman for the National Advertising Division
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB). Recently,
the division's authority to evaluate false or misleading advertising
was extended to the net.

The most popular online scams, according to the FTC, result
from consumers ordering software online from vanishing vendors.
To avoid such a bilk, Lee Peeler, associate director of advertising
practices at the FTC, says it's best to authorize a credit
card purchase only after you've had a chance to review the
product, or until it's received. Thanks to the shareware movement,
a reputable software vendor will offer either a demo of the
application or a trial period if you ask for it.

Here are some additional tips for checking out a potential online
scam:

Procure a physical address. "This is important if a complaint
is to be filed or action is taken against the company. Consumers
should always be wary of P.O. box businesses," Peeler says.
These addresses, he says, are often the proxy for individuals
using their home computers as agents of fraud.

Do your homework. Peeler suggests using newsgroups and chat
rooms to get references before making a purchase. (However,
it's important to verify the source of at least two or three
such references, to make sure they're not false claims planted
by scammers.) When in doubt, the FTC also suggests you contact
your Internet or online service provider with information about
suspicious sites or promotions.

To check financial or investment offers, consult the Securities
and Exchange Commission at the Office of Consumer Affairs.
The commission can tell you if an investment is registered
or if a salesperson is licensed to sell what's being offered.

Use a credit card. Despite the security issues of releasing
credit card information over the Internet, Peeler says, "When
you go outside the credit card purchasing system, you lose
protection. There aren't any billing-disputes rights to protect
you from unauthorized purchases or theft."

Make that call. Online fraud is clearly a global issue, though
its enforcement remains a regional duty. Report suspicious
businesses or individuals to your local Better Business Bureau,
Consumer Protection Agency or Attorney General's office. The
CBBB is adding a complaint form to its home page and plans
to add an Internet scam alert section. If you feel a particular
advertisement is either misleading or completely false, the
CBBB will evaluate your claim. If it determines the complaint
valid, it then will ask the advertiser to comply with ethical
standards before taking legal action. The National Fraud Information
Center's toll-free phone service, at 800-876-7060, takes fraud
reports and answers consumers' questions about online scams.

Report all losses. Collins urges consumers to report deceitful
businesses, no matter how little the loss. "You can help others
in the future to determine which businesses are ethical or
not," Collins says. "Scam artists depend on that $20 or $30
from thousands of people the same as if they have received
$1 million from [one] individual."

Net.News: The Nielsen Survey Says 

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

You're smart, you're relatively well-paid, and you have about
a one-in-three chance of being a woman. According to a recent
Nielsen Media Research survey commissioned by CommerceNet,
you're the typical Internet user.

The study bases its findings on 4,200 phone surveys-methodology
that distinguishes it from other Internet reports typically
conducted on the net. The study says 37 million people in North
America over 16 years of age enjoy net access. Those surveyed
are generally better educated, with higher incomes, than the
general population. Among other findings, the study's respondents
average 5-1/2 hours a week online. And while males represent
66 percent of net users, they actually create 77 percent of
network traffic. Meanwhile, 31 percent of all respondents report
daily net access.

Net.News: From the Alley to the Valley-Cyberspace's Great Bicoastal Divide

By:
Kate Gerwig

It's the difference between lofts and cubicles art and engineering
coffee and Coke hip and geek. It's the difference between Silicon
Alley and Silicon Valley.

Since the mid-1970s, when San Jose, Calif., and its environs
were dubbed Silicon Valley, the region has reigned as the mecca
of advanced computer development. Meanwhile, on the Right Coast,
whatever New York's Silicon Alley (a nebulous downtown zone
comprising parts of Soho, Chelsea, and the Flatiron District)
lacks in terms of propeller-head quotient it abounds in artsy
design resources-a precious net commodity. That's why MCI/News
Corp's Delphi, Prodigy's content division, and CompuServe's
Entertainment Drive are nesting there.

NetGuide informally surveyed professional residents of both
Silicons to compile this graphical rendering (left) of East
and West.

Net.News: News Filters Stem the Tide

By:
Lynn Ginsburg

Had it with online news overload? Personalized news services
deliver only the stories you need or want to see.

Both Microsoft and Ziff-Davis Interactive already have debuted
customized news services. The latest entry is Individual Inc.'s
personalized news service, iNews, which was expected to debut
on the Microsoft Network by press time. INews lets subscribers
set criteria to filter numerous news sources. It draws information
from hundreds of newswires, magazines, newsletters, and newspapers,
with major media sources like the Associated Press, Business
Wire, Reuters, Newsbytes, IDG Communications, Ziff Davis Publishing
Co., and CMP Publications Inc. (NetGuide's parent company)

The iNews configuration employs the venerable Microsoft Wizard
system, helping you choose up to 10 topics as filters for your
news profile. Thereafter, iNews generates a new issue every
night, sending you up to 20 briefs for your chosen topics and
industries. When clicked upon, links within each brief take
you to Individual's Web site of full-text stories.

INews monthly subscription prices are low-$6.90 per month, or
$3.95 if you allow your name to be sold for marketing purposes.
The higher price keeps you untouchable.

You can tap Ziff Davis Interactive's personalized news service,
ZD Net Personal View, via the company's ZD Net/World Wide Web
Edition. Unlike iNews, advertiser-sponsored Personal View is
free to registered users. However, news is limited to computer
topics, drawn from PC Magazine, MacWeek, and other Ziff publications,
plus computer industry news distributors like Newsbytes, Business
Wire, and PR Newswire.

Personal View users must fill out a personal profile to set
news filters. When you log into the service each day, you're
presented with the stories that match your personal profile.

Net.News: What's Up With the Baby Bells? A Look at Internet Access Nationwide



U S West(14 Western states)

Offers dial-up consumer access in Denver, Minneapolis, Omaha,
Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattleseven at speeds
of up to 28.8 Kbps and ISDN (64 Kbps). Dedicated business access
is available at 56 Kbps through DS3 in these same metro areas.

Ameritech(Five Midwestern states)

Dial-up consumer trial in progress in Champaign, Ill., with
rollout beginning early this year at 28.8 Kbps and ISDN (64
and 128 Kbps). Dedicated service now available for large business
customers in nine major metro areas.

Nynex(Seven Northeastern states)

Offers no consumer dial-up yet, but access for six states' residential
and small-business customers is expected this year. Dedicated
access for large-business customers due midyear.

Bell Atlantic(Six Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia)

Plans to offer Internet access but has not announced specific
services, though chairman Ray Smith has said consumer dial
up service will begin by end of this year.

Pacific Bell(California and Nevada)

Dial-up access up to 28.8 Kbps and ISDN (64 and128 Kbps) for
consumers/small businesses in four major metro areas. Business
customers offered dedicated access from 56 Kbps to 45 Mbps.
SBC(Five Central states)

SBC plans to roll out Internet access services by end of this
year, but has not announced specifics.

BellSouth(Nine Southern states)

Plans include residential dial-up service sometime in the future.
Dedicated business access is offered in four metro areas: Atlanta;
Miami, West Palm Beach/Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Research
Triangle Park, N.C., with 16 locations to come this year. Complete
rollout in 1997.

Net.News: An MSN Progress Report

By:
Kate Gerwig

The sky was supposed to fall for America Online, CompuServe,
and Prodigy when Microsoft launched its Microsoft Network last
August.

However, the sky appears to be holding, with the major online
services working hard to improve their offerings and to maintain
subscribers. Microsoft even feels it deserves some credit for
whatever overall improvements the market experiences. "The
fact that Microsoft entered the business, in some ways, raised
the bar for online services. Suddenly, they're improving their
services and coming up with more friendly user interfaces,"
says Naveen Jain, MSN senior technical marketing manager.

Microsoft remains mum on exact subscriber numbers, but industry
analysts estimate MSN acquired more than 400,000 subscribers
after its first two months in business. Before MSN launched,
some analysts predicted up to 10 million users would sign on
by the end of 1995. Meanwhile, Microsoft evangelists are keeping
to a more modest goal-1 million subscribers by the end of its
first year.

Early reviews of MSN criticized its alleged lack of bells and
whistles. This is not unusual, according to Jupiter Communications
analyst Adam Schoenfeld. He believes that while Microsoft did
"a bad job of rolling MSN out, it would have been impossible
to live up to the hype surrounding it."

In an attempt at maximum quality control, Microsoft maintains
it will cap its MSN subscriber base at 500,000 temporarily
while it works out any bugs. Jain says the company wants to
get feedback from its subscribers and improve the service any
way it can before opening the gates again.

Inteco Corp. vice president and market analyst Rob Rubin is
skeptical about the strategy: "That would be like turning away
money. I don't think it's in their nature to do that."

Net.News: Log On, Look Around, Tune Out

By:
Kate Gerwig

Since the dawn of online services some 16 years ago, about 6.2
million home PC users have tuned in, then ditched an online
account, a new study claims.

A mail survey of 10,000 U.S. households in August by Inteco
Corp., a Norwalk, Conn., market forecasting firm, reveals high
cancellation rates on America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe,
GEnie and Delphi.

While the online services themselves don't like to talk about
"churn" rates, varying estimates report that 30 to 50 percent
of those who join an online service each year eventually cancel.
Inteco vice president and market analyst Rob Rubin said the
results don't mean business is bad. "The online industry continues
to experience excellent growth, but our study clearly indicates
there's little brand loyalty and that there's a significant
amount of dissatisfaction with all of the services," he says.

Actually, many of the deserters never truly subscribed at all.
Among the household users surveyed, Inteco found that many
simply depart after a free trial period is over. Many PC users
switch from one service to another to take advantage of free
trials or to try out new features, Rubin said. Eventually they
cancel the less satisfactory of the two to avoid paying two
monthly charges.

Net.News: Dishing Out Net Access

By:
Kate Gerwig

Rather than dispensing Internet access by the hour, Hughes Network
Systems simply charges information junkies by the megabyte.

DirecPC, Hughes' high-speed, satellite-based Internet access
service, is probably too pricey for a novice user. But if you
need lots of information and you're tired of spending 45 minutes
dusting your computer while downloading a large file, DirecPC's
scheme could be your ticket, with 400-Kbps data throughout.

After you shell out $995 for the right hardware, which includes
a 24-inch satellite dish, an adapter card, and Windows-based
software, Hughes offers a $15.95 monthly subscription for 30
megabytes of usage, or $39.95 a month for 130 megabytes.

For this expense, surely you'll want to cost-justify DirecPC
in your household budget. "You probably wouldn't download a
6 MB video clip from a Disney movie with your average modem,
unless you had extra time on your hands," says a DirecPC representative.
Lucky for you, time is not of the essence.

To make for a more rounded content offering, DirecPC also offers
CNN Headline and Reuters news, as well as stock and sports
news. Originally targeted to businesses, the system currently
is available in the United States and Canada.

Net.News: You Want My What?


Call it low-rent hacking-or just plain sleazy-but a bunch of
online marauders have been, under a variety of ruses, out to
pilfer passwords from unsuspecting America Online subscribers.

A NetGuide editor received the above "instant message" one rainy
October night in a chat area. However, according to AOL advisories,
employees of the service would never require a subscribers
to divulge a password online.

In most cases, the offending sender's screen name is generated
by AOHell, a hacker program. This underground software can,
among other wily attributes, generate renegade AOL accounts
by creating falsified new-user sign-up information.

Net.News: "I Want My Web TV!"

By:
Kate Gerwig

Tired of booting up your PC to Web surf? How about using a special
TV, or an "Internet box" attached to your TV set, instead?

Though Oracle Corp. hasn't officially announced a "Web TV" product,
Lawrence Ellison, the company's chairman and CEO, discussed
introducing such a product in a speech he gave during an October
telecommunications industry conference. Compaq Corp. also has
announced a similar project in conjunction with Intel Corp.
to create an "Internet Surfer."

Such preliminary announcements give birth to interesting speculations
among experts. At the Yankee Group, a Boston-based consultancy,
for example, analyst Gregory Wester thinks what might actually
materialize from Oracle or another vendor is a set-top Internet
box-much like a cable TV converter. Still, Wester thinks this
approach is limited. "Traditional PC users are used to working
on specific applications," he says.

While David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments,
a New York money-management research firm specializing in interactive
technology, lauds Oracle for tackling such a project, he sees
the price point as crucial. Even $500 is too steep for the
mass market, according to Simons. "In the world of consumer
electronics, the price tag should be about $250," he says.

Net.News: Wow! Woos Net Novices

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

Novices will get a shiny pair of training wheels this spring
when CompuServe's hush-hush Project Wow! online service debuts.

At first blush, this new venue seems to be pitted against America
Online and Prodigy. But according to Scott Kauffman, CompuServe's
vice president for consumer markets and Project Wow! leader,
the company "is not marketing against anyone" with this combination
online service/Internet access product. Still, the groups Kauffman
says Wow! will target-families, young professionals, and seniors
constitute a huge chunk of those services' users. For these
folks, "the technology has to become invisible," he says. To
that end, Kauffman says Wow! will provide "a proper balance
[of] content, community, and customization."

The company hopes to attract 1 million subscribers in its first
year. "We're trying to put the Internet in context," Kauffman
says. "We're not going to prevent adult men and women from
having a full Internet experience."

Mark Mooradian, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, in New
York, says CompuServe may miss the boat by launching its new
service so long after other, similar offerings.

Net.Dern

By:
Daniel Dern

We lost another valuable Internet resource in October. It was
the victim of the cluelessness engendered by the very same
national online services that are busily hyping themselves
as purveyors of the Internet.

When Catherine Yronwode, an America Online subscriber, was denied
Usenet posting privileges by the mail2news@cs.utexas.edu gateway,
she posted a long, threatening letter of complaint to news.admin.misc
and a dozen or so other newsgroups.

The response of gateway-keeper Fletcher Mattox, who'd been responsible
for providing this free-for-use, unfunded resource for a decade,
was that of any sensible, overworked system administrator supporting
a volunteer project. He pulled the plug. (Yronwode's activity
was not the sole cause of his decision. Her outburst, however,
was inarguably the event that caused Mattox to decide it was
time to call it quits.)

Many of the unofficial but valuable resources in the pre-deluge
Internet and Usenet were similar labors of love. So, as they
get shut-or shot-down, how can they be replaced? And as new
services get offered, how can they be funded in ways that are
self-sustaining? Well, it depends on what kind of information
resource you're talking about. Once you pare away the services
that we'll gladly pay for, like BusinessWire or Dow Jones,
you've got sites offering sales and marketing information from
the likes of Apple, IBM, Sony, and others that will gladly
pay to hawk their wares. What's left? A large middle ground,
comprising commercial advertising and sponsorship.

With sponsorship, businesses subsidize the online content we
do want, in return for attaching their own messages somewhere
within the content (it's the same theory as commercial TV).
During the past year or so, sponsors have discovered the Internet,
and the Internet has discovered the money font of sponsorships.
In fact, there's no shortage of resources soliciting sponsorship.
(For a list of prices for links and sponsorships, see http
//www.netcreations.com/ipa/adindex.htm; for a list of "sponsorable"
sites and resources, see http://www.trafficresource.com/.)

However, few companies are willing to sponsor sites without
first getting some information about the site's traffic-preferably
evidence of "readership." In current Internet jargon, that
means counting hits. Sponsors want reassurance, and sites want
to command top price.

Mandatory registration is one scheme that gathers user IDs and
passwords-along with demographics, in some cases-for the service
provider. This arrangement, initially employed by sites like
GNN, HotWired and others, has proved less than fruitful. Most
of us are already drowning in passwords and IDs. What's more,
if these systems are so smart, why can't they validate us based
on information from our browsers?

But why keep people out when your goal is to rope them in? Only
interested parties will stay for more than a screen's worth
or two anyway. Sites like HotWired have adopted flexible strategies,
putting enough of the information outside the "IDs required"
zone that we can, at least, get a taste without having to go
through registration first.

Meanwhile, advertisers want hits. So sites run counting programs,
which usually watch downloads of a graphic near the top of
an entry page. Companies like Nielsen and I/PRO have announced
"site monitoring and hit reporting/analysis" services to slice
and dice this traffic data.

There's only one problem. The data's meaningless. For one thing,
lots of people aren't downloading the hit-triggering items.
They may have their browsers set to "no-graphics" mode, to
expedite page-getting.

This method doesn't count users employing a non-graphics browser,
like Lynx, which doesn't even touch graphics (unless you're
using a shell-enhancer like SLIPknot or I-Comm, or finding
and grabbing images "by hand"). This situation alone invalidates
most count figures.

Yet another, more practical issue: A user may come in via the
side door, by zooming below the top page to something on a
lower page, never triggering the graphics. Add this user to
the pile of visitors the hit-counters won't catch.

Some Webwatchers out there don't rely on watching one or two
pieces, but instead watch all requests. Does this mean data
we can count on? Once again, no. Many users have their Webware
set to cache-that is, to save retrievals on disk. Many sites
use "proxies" that cache these retrieval requests. So if Users
B, C and D request a Web URL that User A's already asked for,
B's, C's, and D's requests will be fulfilled locally-from the
cached copy-instead of dragging duplicates across the Internet.

This scheme helps reduce unnecessary load on a site's Internet
connection. That's a good thing, since three or four Mosaic
users grabbing weather maps can saturate a 56-kilobit-per-second
line. But for advertisers, it means site visitors are seeing
the content they sponsor without being counted.

One solution would be Web servers and browsers that could send
back hit reports whenever a URL was examined from a local cache
instead of being retrieved again. If Webware would check a
URL's "last-modified" data automatically before deciding whether
to retrieve or use what's cached, hit-counters could get this
as by-product.

But all this still begs the question-because it's not a done
deal-are hits the appropriate currency to assess Web usage?
Even those actual download-based hits don't mean anything.
The Web is bursting with people looking at sites because of
"coolness," or just cruising at random. "Sure, it's nice to
see tens or hundreds of thousands, even millions of hits in
a Web log," says Larry Chase, president of The Online Ad Agency
(http://advert.com). "But what's the sense if all they do is
hit your home page and bounce off into the atmosphere, never
to be heard from again?"

"The trick is attracting qualified leads that eventually lead
to conversions," Chase says. Conversions may be immediate orders,
or requests for brochures or prices, but they indicate definite
interest in the company and its offerings.

Companies shouldn't read too much into hits per day, or even
hit levels after specific announcements. "Some sales cycles
are longer than others," Chase points out. "800

FLOWERS has a short sales cycle, while Liberty Mutual Insurance
has a longer one. The key is tracking from when the conversions
came, not the hits. I'd gladly pay more for a stream of qualified
prospects that are apt to turn into conversions than less for
thousands of meaningless visitors, who'll forget I ever existed
three clicks after they left my site." Any site that can report
conversions and customers, not just a lot of hits, is bound
to make the short list when a company is evaluating which sites
to sponsor.

But there may still be a role for hit-watching. For example,
good hit reporting can track derivative information, like how
many visitors become customers or how long it usually takes
(do they buy on the first or fourth visit?). This can help
a site manager re-evaluate and fine-tune the selling part of
the Web.

If you still think hits can be meaningful, here are two Internet
tools I've conceptualized: HitMaker and BrowserBeater. IMHBCO
(In My Humble But Correct Opinion), these products would render
hit-counting meaningless. HitMaker would take a list of URLs
and "hit" them with specified frequency-a great way to inflate
hit counts. It wouldn't be long before the credibility of hit
counts would suffer. The flip side of the coin would be BrowserBeater.
This anonymous Web browser would work in tandem with a proxy
server to shield your identifying information. To access ID
required sites like HotWired, BrowserBeater would "borrow"
names from appropriate lists of pre-registered IDs and passwords
for such Web sites.

The HitMaker and BrowserBeater could skew a site's hit rate
significantly. But even if they're never developed, I don't
think it would change hit-counting's diminishing status. If
sponsors are going to require "proof of value" from sites,
let's give them a meaningful metric.

Net.Media

By:
Michelle Slatalla

Phil Gramm waves an American flag in my face. He hopes it'll
remind me of him. Pat Buchanan compiled an archive of patriotic
historical documents for me to read.

And Bill Clinton? He keeps offering to show me photos of him
and Hillary ladling in a soup kitchen.

The 1996 presidential campaign season is going to be different
from all previous years, for one reason-the candidates are
setting up Internet headquarters. It makes sense, in theory,
because it finally will give them a way to bypass the media,
to shovel unlimited amounts of information directly at voters.
A candidate can put up reams of transcripts of his speeches
and put his own spin on these and other facts he disseminates.

"The Internet is perfect for Pat, because his message right
now is not getting past the media. There's a media blackout,"
says Linda Muller, the Internet coordinator for the Buchanan
campaign. "I think people are tired of the media's digestion
and regurgitation anyway. We don't need someone to tell us
what we just heard. Let us draw our own conclusions."

The candidates will rush to cyberspace in the coming months.
I expect that the Old Media-newspaper, TV, and radio reporters
will have to start monitoring the net for news. Already, dozens
of Web sites are conducting straw polls on the candidates and
on issues. Those results might become fertile fodder for news.

"Reporters are still trying to figure out what it means to us,
what it means in terms of doing a complete job covering the
campaign," says Susan Page, White House correspondent for USA
Today. "It's good when people can get information unfiltered,
like they can by watching C-SPAN, for instance. Then they don't
have to have a reporter, who may or may not be smart, filter
it."

In fact, there's a name for the act of cutting out the media
and connecting the viewer with the source. It's "disintermediation,"
one of my favorite big words. Good for using at a cocktail
party. Disintermediation is what the Internet is all about.
Newspapers are limited by space; TV broadcasts are limited
by time. But the net has no time or space constraints. You
can find as much information as you want, whenever you want
it.

New kinds of media emerging online will most likely provide
that detailed level of data. Congressional Quarterly, something
I formerly used as a reference for term papers, could become
an influential media player in this new world, via a Web site.

As far as the candidates are concerned, the Internet's highly
educated voter population-12 million Americans with a penchant
for poring through reams of raw data-are exactly who they want
to reach. This could be a very good thing for us as voters,
since we'll have more direct access to the candidates. We will
no longer have to rely on The New York Times or the networks'
newscasts to give us a quote from last night's rubber-chicken
dinner policy speech. Instead, we can log into a candidate's
home page and read the full text, then click to a hyperlink
that tells us how he voted on the same issues in the past.

For candidates trailing in the polls-those who can't afford
30-second ad spots on prime-time TV shows-the Internet will
be a great equalizer. Setting up a home page on the Web is
cheap. Case in point: A campaign volunteer designed Buchanan's
for free and hung it on a server for only 50 cents a month
per megabyte of data (the first 5 MB are free)

Candidates with deeper pockets will be able to experiment with
the Internet more intensely. For instance, a Boulder, Colo.
based Web site called Votelink (http://www.votelink.com/) is
hoping candidates will be willing to pay from $2,500 to $15,000
a month for a package that includes surveys of voters' perceptions
of major issues and the candidates' platforms. Votelink online
forums let the candidate (or his aides) sit at a computer and
answer voters' questions directly.

But let's take a deep breath before we start predicting that
online campaigns will totally transform the political landscape.
Before I looked at any of the presidential candidates' home
pages, I toyed with the idea that the net would elect the next
president. But the current state of cyberspace campaigns tempered
my enthusiasm.

So far, most of the candidates' pages are unimaginative-a click
over to AT&T's site was exciting in comparison. There's a communications
problem here if I'd rather read about how switches work than
compare the candidates' abortion platforms.

Maybe it's because the whole Web thing is new to them; after
all, they've been doing it for only a few months. The presidential
candidates figured out the first step back in mid-1995: Get
online and that will be enough of a novelty to garner a front
page story in The Wall Street Journal.

The next step will be far more difficult. These politicians,
who for the most part aren't too computer-literate themselves,
will have to learn how to use the Internet more creatively
to deliver their messages.

For now, the candidates seem content to mimic each other, with
straightforward text blocks dryly explaining their views on
abortion, the budget, taxes, and other topics that could use
some multimedia effects.

The candidates' personal idiosyncrasies manage to peek through,
of course. But I wonder if that's even something they did on
purpose. Lamar Alexander-who pundits expect will rally with
one of the more savvy net campaigns, since he's an outsider
looking for a new medium for his message-wallpapered his page
(http://www.nashville.net/~lamar/) to resemble his signature
flannel shirt. Buchanan's home page (http://www.buchanan.org
) has a definite colonial style to it, with an emblem of an
American Eagle and the Buchanan Brigade Library, an online
archive of documents that includes stories about Paul Revere,
poems, and prayers.

Clinton's family photos on the White House's official home page
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/) have the studied feel of a project
that 50 editors signed off on. I got the same feeling from
watching his biographical video at the Democratic Convention
in 1992. He has so many handlers that it is becoming increasingly
impossible for him to convey anything authentic about himself
as a person.

The same can be said for Bob Dole, judging from his home page
(http://www.dole96.com/), where the hyper-glossy images of
him smiling benignly recall those circa-1957 agricultural filmstrips
we all had to watch in high school.

Gramm's page (http://www.gramm96.org/), in comparison, is a
relief. Despite the not-exactly-original American flag motif,
it loads more quickly than other pages, and offers a straightforward
menu of Gramm's stance on dozens of issues.

"You really want to avoid looking too blow-dried," says Berkeley
Internet Connections president Eric Davis, who designed Gramm's
page. "I sort of view the Internet as a place for scrappy young
men and women, and I designed the page to appeal to people
like me, 25-year-old political junkies who know a lot about
how the net works."

Actually, if you're looking for trenchant political commentary,
there are a few very witty sites to peruse-the many parody
pages satirizing the candidates. The best fake Dole page (http
//www.dole96.org/) is subtly wallpapered with Dole pineapple
can labels. Likewise, on one fake Buchanan page (http://www.buchanan96.org
) you'll find that the candidate allegedly opposes abortion
because "every fetus is a potential taxpayer. Each abortion
reduces the tax base of the federal government."

Some political consultants think candidates will remain cautious
about their online images. For one thing, there's no hard evidence
about who exactly reads these home pages and how the information
affects voters' opinions. That kind of feedback won't be gathered
until after November.

"How many voters can you reach? And how many net users look
at the political home sites in the next 90 days? Those are
the kinds of questions that need to be answered, because for
now the candidates still feel like they can probably reach
20 times more people with TV," says Joel Benenson, a political
consultant at Penn & Schoen, which conducts polls on behalf
of the Clinton campaign.

These points are undoubtedly true. But how many of these citizens
vote?

Michelle Slatalla recently completed a suspense thriller about
the Internet.

Net.Law

By:
Mark Eckenwiler

One of the wonderful things about cyberspace, generally speaking,
is that each of us can create a new persona.

Moreover, fanciful user names and the proliferation of anonymous
remailers let us interact with other denizens of the global
electronic village in near-total anonymity. In the future,
it seems, everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes.

But while it may be true that (in the words of the now-famous
New Yorker cartoon) on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,
the promise of anonymity also carries an undeniable downside.
For every CancelMoose performing the public service of canceling
Usenet spam, there's another equally anonymous (but far less
benign) poster-like the CancelPoodle, canceling articles that
criticize the Church of Scientology. It's surely the best known,
or more accurately, unknown offender.

The cluster of issues surrounding online identity and pseudonymity
provokes legal questions as well. And while U.S. courts have
had little opportunity to analyze the legal status of electronic
anonymity, the case of a disgruntled Ohio taxpayer's grassroots
protest sheds some helpful light on the First Amendment's protection
of anonymous speech.

At a 1988 public meeting, Margaret McIntyre expressed her opposition
to a proposed school-tax increase by handing out leaflets.
McIntyre signed some of these leaflets "Concerned Parents and
Taxpayers" instead of using her name. Although the flier contained
no false or libelous statements, McIntyre found herself the
object of unwelcome attention-and the recipient of a $100 fine
from the Ohio Elections Commission.

Her offense? She violated an Ohio election law that made it
illegal to circulate written materials endorsing or opposing
a candidate-or even a referendum issue-without the author's
name and address. While an Ohio trial court struck down the
fine, two state appellate courts (including the Ohio Supreme
Court) decided that the First Amendment did not protect McIntyre.

On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court voted overwhelmingly (7 to
2) to strike down the statute. Writing for six members of the
Court, Justice John Paul Stevens noted that "under our Constitution,
anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice,
but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent It thus
exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the
First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals
from retaliation-and their ideas from suppression-at the hand
of an intolerant society."

Even Justice Clarence Thomas, ordinarily not an overly zealous
defender of First Amendment rights, agreed with the outcome.
Thomas noted that the Federalist Papers themselves-issued under
the name "Publius"-are among the most famous pseudonymous works
in American history.

The McIntyre decision marked the culmination of a series of
Supreme Court cases that have found a right to anonymity under
the First Amendment. The Court laid the groundwork for this
modern trend in NAACP vs. Alabama (1958), holding that the
state of Alabama could not compel the NAACP to disclose its
membership list. The strong likelihood that doing so would
expose NAACP members to threats and retribution meant, in the
Court's view, that compelled disclosure would harm the members'
right to associate freely.

Two years later, the Supreme Court enlarged the scope of First
Amendment privacy in Talley vs. California. In that case, the
Court considered-and struck down-a Los Angeles ordinance prohibiting
the distribution of any anonymous leaflet, holding that a blanket
ban against anonymity violates the right to free speech under
the First Amendment.

The importance of McIntyre is that it took a much narrower law
one regulating only certain types of anonymous publications
(those advocating election causes)-and held it invalid under
the same rationale. Moreover, the reasoning in McIntyre and
its precursors applies directly to anonymity (and pseudonymity)
on the Internet.

Those who would attempt to ban anonymous e-mail or Usenet articles
often complain that such messages are of dubious worth without
author attribution. Internet service providers and online services
remain free to prohibit the sending of anonymous messages,
as a number of prominent private universities have attempted
to do. (These efforts have been largely in vain.) The McIntyre
decision, however, made it clear that a broad-based legal ban
on anonymous messages would not be shielded from constitutional
challenge.

Specifically, the majority view assesses the value of a real
signature, as opposed to a pseudonym. "In the case of a handbill
written by a private citizen who is not known to the recipient,
the name and address of the author adds little, if anything,
to the reader's ability to evaluate the document's message,"
says the Supreme Court. Moreover, as the Court observed in
a footnote, readers are not stupid. When they see an anonymous
or pseudonymous message, they can and will take its ambiguous
source into account when assessing its verity. This observation
is, of course, borne out a hundred times a day on Usenet, where
anonymous articles often meet with a skeptical reception.

According to their opponents, anonymous online messages facilitate
libel, fraud, and the sexual abuse of minors. (Indeed, last
year in an overwrought article attacking the use of anonymous
mail servers, the author of The Wall Street Journal's Personal
Technology column railed against each of these allegedly ubiquitous
problems.) What these critics often omit entirely, or give
short shrift to, are the positive aspects of anonymous speech.
With their identities unknown, political and ethnic minorities
under oppressive regimes can speak without fear of reprisal;
religious dissidents, whether criticizing a state-sponsored
religion or a vicious cult bent on harassing apostates, can
do likewise; and survivors of rape or sexual abuse can join
in anonymous online discussions.

The Supreme Court has recognized these beneficial uses. As the
justices observed in the Talley case, "anonymous pamphlets,
leaflets, brochures, and even books have played an important
role in the progress of mankind It is plain that anonymity
has sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes."

Moreover, the Court has adopted this rights-protective stance,
despite its recognition that anonymity can shield libel or
fraud. In both McIntyre and Talley, the Court freely conceded
that such misconduct may be punished appropriately. However,
the Court also has ruled that the First Amendment won't allow
blanket bans on anonymous speech-bans that would indirectly
punish such libelous or fraudulent offenses.

To be sure, anonymous speech may have some limitations placed
upon it. The McIntyre decision leaves open the possibility
that some narrower categories of anonymous speech could be
banned. A second, seemingly contradictory line of Supreme Court
cases upholds the power of the government to require disclosure
of the names of contributors to political campaigns. These
cases make it clear that even in the realm of political speech
at the core of First Amendment protections-the Court might
in the future endorse legislation narrowly targeted at anonymous
speech sponsored by campaign organizations.

In fact, the California Supreme Court did essentially that in
November 1994-before the McIntyre decision-when it upheld fines
imposed on Daniel Griset, a candidate for the Santa Ana, Calif.,
city council, for circulating pseudonymous fliers attacking
his opponent. The state court took pains to point out, however,
that its ruling did not address the constitutionality of banning
anonymous speech by individual citizens. The fact that the
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in Griset's case
five days after issuing the McIntyre decision suggests its
approval of this outcome.

Finally, it is useful to note what is not protected by McIntyre.
If an anonymous remailer keeps track of its users and their
pseudonyms, nothing would prevent a U.S. court from ordering
that information to be disclosed in a related lawsuit. Nothing,
that is, unless the remailer is outside the United States,
but even that's no guarantee of safety. Last February, Finnish
police forced the administrator of the best-known anonymous
server, anon.penet.fi, to reveal the identity of one of his
users. Preserving the legal right to anonymity is one thing;
preserving anonymity itself, evidently, is another matter entirely.@

Judith H. Bernstein, Gayle Isaacs, and Ted Stevenson

Don't worry, it's probably not you-or your computer. If you're
running Netscape Navigator with 14 helper apps, or Windows

Short of popping in 32 MB of shiny new memory modules, what's
a net surfer to do? One answer is to invest $40 to $50 in Quarterdeck

into thinking it's more than the sum of its parts. By replacing
Windows' virtual memory system and compressing portions of
RAM, MagnaRAM2 can reputedly increase your "apparent" RAM by

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: 3Com's ISDN Modem Has Major 
Internet Impact

By:
Daniel Scolnick

One of the first of the long-awaited personal ISDN communications
devices to appear on the market, 3Com Corp.'s Impact ISDN "modem"
is available for both the Macintosh and PC, with or without
V.32-compliant (14.4-Kbps) analog fax/modem capabilities. We
tested the IBM-compatible model 3C872 with a V.34 fax/modem,
which lists for $749. 3Com's digital-only models list for $549
each. Regardless of platform, all units incorporate both the
NT-1 terminal needed to make an ISDN connection and an analog
voice port for attaching phones, fax machines, and answering
machines to the ISDN line.

No-Sweat Setup

The 3Com Impact is easy to install: You simply attach it to
a serial port just like a standard modem. (3Com highly recommends
that IBM-compatible systems be equipped with a high-speed 16550
UART and run DOS 3.1 or later; Macs should use an 8-pin serial
port and System 7 or higher.) The straightforward Windows-based
setup and diagnostic software made short work of configuring
the unit. All procedures are simple and well-documented.

Net Speed

Using the Trumpet Winsock DLL and Netscape Navigator, we connected
to the Internet using both digital (ISDN) and analog (standard)
services. The Impact worked smoothly and seamlessly with whichever
connection we chose, but that's not to say that the results
were the same: With ISDN operating at full capacity, our connection
speed was more than four times that of a typical V.34 (28.8
Kbps) connection. Here's how it works.

Uses Two Channels

The Impact lets you use an ISDN line's two 64-Kbps "B" channels
("business channels") simultaneously-in a couple of different
ways. To achieve maximum Internet throughput, Multilink PPP
(a special variant of the serial Point to Point Protocol) can
effectively combine the two into a single connection of 128
Kbps capacity.

Then again, the built-in analog phone port lets you attach and
use a phone, fax machine, answering machine, or other telephony
device in tandem with an ISDN connection on the other channel.

In fact, a feature called dynamic bandwidth allocation lets
you place an analog phone call even while a Multilink PPP connection
is active.

We've waited close to 15 years for ISDN to become a reality.
If the 3Com Impact is any indication of what we can look forward
to, the wait will not have been in vain. While this hardware
is far from budget priced, what can we say? It works seamlessly,
giving us Internet connections beyond our wildest serial dreams.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Inside Track Turns 
CompuServe Into a Portfolio Manager

By:
Theresa W. Carey

MicroQuest, publisher of Inside Track investment software, has
a good idea: Take advantage of the commercial online provider
with the best services for personal investors and provide a
front end that tracks portfolio performance. First the positives
of this $49.95 Windows product:

The program is easy to use and has some online help built in,
though not a lot. You can set up as many portfolio groupings
as you'd like, and you can get reports on the performance of
each individually or of all your holdings together. When you
add a security to a portfolio, you have to work through several
dialog boxes that let you specify breakpoint-prices that will
generate an alert. Using a nifty feature, you can set the program
up to run even when you're not at your computer, and the alerts
can be programmed to beep your pager.

Inside Track taps into CompuServe Information Manager to get
you online; if you don't have CIM, you'll have to install it.

The program has some rough spots: If you want historical pricing,
you'll have to log on and download it one security at a time
not efficient. Resized windows revert to default size the next
time you open them-annoying. If you add an account while you
have the transaction register open, the new account doesn't
show up on the list until you close the register and open it
again-sloppy.

Inside Track has a lot of potential. It's not filled with technical
analysis bells and whistles, but it can give you well-formatted
basic information about your investments.

CompuServe members can GO QUEST to download an interactive demo.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Getting Serious About Page Design

By:
Joel T. Patz

Cruising the Internet these days is an eye-opening experience.
With new Web sites appearing daily and familiar sites changing
style, format and content, there's an unending variety of stimuli
clamoring for attention. To attract interest and increase visits
to your site, design a Web page to grab your viewer. How to
do this in today's increasingly complex technical environment
is the subject of Web Publisher's Design Guide for Macintosh
by Mary Jo Fahey, $34.99, published by The Coriolis Group.
(WPDG for Windows 95, co-written by Fahey and Jeff Brown, is
expected by the time you read this.)

Conceived to provide the graphic artist with tools to design
outstanding Web sites, this 416-page treasure trove of advice,
insight, practical instruction, and encouragement aims to do
away with guesswork. It uses Netscape Navigator, Quark XPress
and Photoshop as basic tools.

Opening chapters discuss Web navigation using both conventional
2-D controls and futuristic-looking 3-D controls that take
advantage of VRML and 3DMF (3D Meta File). You'll learn how
to work with images and how to manipulate the time it takes
to download them.

Extensive sections on photography, animation and 3-D graphics
explain the conventions of these media and the practical differences
between print and Web graphics. Emphasis is placed on learning
from existing Web pages and leveraging the advantages of various
image formats. Tips on digital photography, QuickTime VR, Apple's
QuickDraw 3D, and CGI (Common Gateway Interface) open new worlds
for Web designers.

Accompanied by a CD-ROM loaded with tools, templates, and examples,
Design Guide provides the essential practical side of the equation.
Inspiration completes it.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Secure Wallet Stashes Cybercash

By:
Harry Hawk

CheckFree Corp. has entered the Internet commerce fray with
a software scheme for moving credit-card data securely across
the Internet. The system, CheckFree Wallet, feels secure, is
easy to set up, and is even easier to use. Best of all, it's
free.To get set up with Wallet, first download the software
(from http://www.mc2-csr.com/vmall/checkfree/v20/software.html).
This takes about five minutes using a 28.8-Kbps modem. Then
connect to CheckFree and configure the application by registering
your name or "persona." Next, establish a password and input
the credit cards you plan to use. This one-time process might
take up to 30 minutes, but with signup out of the way, making
purchases will be far quicker than ordering through an 800
number.

Wallet works only for transactions with merchants who've adopted
the system themselves. For a listing of these merchants, point
your browser at http://www.mc2csr.com/vmall/checkfree/v20/wmalls.html.
When we checked this site early in November, only about a dozen
merchants were online, but more will be coming soon.

With Wallet, your credit-card data is never stored on the merchant's
Web site, so there's nothing online for hackers to steal.

Visit CheckFree's Web site at http://www.checkfree.com/ for
system requirements and a listing of compatible browsers. The
system currently runs on Windows and will soon run on Macs.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: From One Pipe, Many Connections

By:
William Wong

Ascend's $895 Pipeline 25 is an ISDN Ethernet router designed
for small offices and home offices (SOHO). Routers exchange
data transparently between local area networks (LANs) and remote
networks over phone lines. Thus they can connect LANs in physically
separate offices or-much more likely in the SOHO context-connect
a LAN to the Internet, giving everyone on the LAN a high-speed
net connection.

ISDN service consists not of a single digital line transferring
data at 128 Kbps, but of two 64-Kbps "B" channels that can
be used individually for data or voice connections. You can
plug phones, modems, or fax machines into the Pipeline 25 and
use them for both incoming and outgoing calls-one B channel
per call. The Pipeline 25 can even accept incoming calls when
both B channels are already in use. It simply drops one data
channel, allowing the new call to ring the phone. This gives
a single ISDN line the potential to support a small office's
entire voice and data load.

Setting up the Pipeline 25 and getting an ISDN account can be
tedious, but Ascend and ISPs like PSINet (Herndon, Va., 800
827-7482) can handle much of this for you. PSINet even sells
the Pipeline 25 at a substantial discount ($700) when setting
up a LAN account, which offers unlimited connect time at about
$250 per month.

Ascend's data compression option ($300) potentially ups Pipeline's
transmission speed to 512 Kbps when it's connected to a similarly
equipped router. For further information, contact Ascend Communications
Inc., Alemeda, Calif., 800-621-9578, http://www.ascend.com.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: A Scanner That's No Scam

By:
Joel T. Patz

It took us only five minutes to get the PaperPort Vx from Visioneer
installed and working. Adding this amazing 12- by 2.5- by 3.75
inch scanner to your arsenal of equipment will revolutionize
how you work. Feeding a document into this highly compact unit
turns it on and launches the software; before you know it-in
less than 10 seconds-an image of your document is on screen,
ready for you to work with.

The PaperPort's setup program automatically creates icons that
let it work with any of more than 100 popular applications.
To fax a document, for example, just drag it to the fax icon;
PaperPort launches your fax program and converts the document
to fax format. Drag a scanned document to the OCR icon and
it's converted into an editable file.

The quality of PaperPort's scans is quite good for general-purpose
work and can be adjusted. You can clean up documents, straighten,
trim, and crop. Special technology called SharpPage minimizes
the effects of colored backgrounds.

The Annotation Tool Bar lets you add sticky notes, fill in preprinted
forms, draw freehand and add arrows. And you can organize GIF,
JPEG, PCX and BMP files that you download from the Internet
or other online services on the "Desktop."

Included with PaperPort are PictureWorks Copier, which lets
you enlarge and reduce scanned images and adjust brightness
and contrast, and CardScan, which turns business cards into

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: This Modem Means Business

By:
Joel T. Patz

There are scads of modems out there these days, but no matter
how we use them, we all want speed and high performance. The
new Hayes Optima 228 Business Modem fulfills both criteria
and more. The advantages of data, fax, and voice capabilities
in one box won't escape power users or those just looking for
something better.

Using the latest enhanced v.42bis data-compression, Optima 228
can send and receive at throughput rates up to 230.4 Kbps.
And we had no problems connecting to Internet service providers
and America Online at its highest transmission rate, 28.8 Kbps,
over standard phone lines. It's fast.

The Smartcom Message Center LE and Modem Manager software included
with the Optima turn your computer into a professional answering
service that can distinguish voice from data and fax calls,
maintain as many as 10 mailboxes, and supply fax on-demand.

If you have Caller ID and/or Distinctive Ring, this system supports
them. You can password-protect voice messages and faxes, and
Optima 228 supports dial-back security.

Indicator LEDs adorn the front of this low-profile unit. A voice
data button and small speaker are located on top, microphone
and speaker jacks on the right side. The on/off switch, power,
serial port, line, and phone connectors are on the back. A
modem cable accompanies the Macintosh model, but PC users will
have to supply their own modem cables.

Good stuff like this isn't cheap: Optima 228's sleek performance
and first-class features will cost you $579. For more information,
call 770-840-9200 or visit http://www.hayes.com/.

Web 2000--We Show You Tomorrow's Net Today

By:
Karen Heyman

It's Jan. 2, 2000. You're finally starting to recover after
having stayed up all night to participate in a Virtual World
party, after which even your avatar felt hung over. As you
stumble to the bathroom, you trip over that pile of computer
magazines you've been intending to read, and you see NetGuide's
"Web 2000" cover. For a moment, you're foggy enough to think
you're behind in your reading by only a month. Then suddenly,
horribly, you realize just how long that pile's been stacked
up-because nobody has used the term "Web" for years. - What
will the Web be like in four years? John Fleming, a medievalist
and former chairman of the English Department at Princeton
University, looks back for inspiration in predicting the future.
"I see it as a dramatic extension of something that's already
happened-the invention of movable type" Fleming says.

The invention of movable type changed the world as it was then
known. It disseminated academic knowledge and transformed a
predominantly oral culture-in which scholars memorized entire
books-into a literate one. The combination of the 15th century's
invention of the printing press and the 16th century's translation
of the Latin bible into vernacular languages led to the Protestant
Reformation. Given these examples of the Law of Unintended
Consequences, it's safe to say that as far as the Web is concerned,
we still don't know what we have here. And we won't for at
least another generation.

A Clear Technical Sight

Ironically, the technological path of the Web is somewhat easier
to determine than its cultural impact. Espousing a preference
for "seamless applications," everyone from Tim Berners-Lee
to Microsoft marketers forecast that we'll connect directly
to the net. No longer will we be stuck in the kludgy four-step
process of open application on hard drive, log on to ISP, search
the Web for data to place into an application, manually place
data in application.

As Berners-Lee explains, "People will not have to concern themselves
with where things are stored, whether [they're] on a local
or remote disk, for example. All one will do is specify the
speed and reliability you need for access to a copy of a document,
and the machine will decide, in negotiation with other machines,
where to keep copies.

"The desktop and the Web browser should become one," Berners
Lee continues. "The folder, hotlist, and hypertext document
objects will all become objects that you can change, drag things
into, publish, and send to people." And, he says, the appearance
of objects on screen "will depend less on what software you
have bought shrink-wrapped and more on where you have been
browsing recently. As you browse, your computer will acquire
the software it needs to interact with the information you
are using.

"The important things will be: who has access to an object,
how fast, and how reliably," he says. "I might see a news article
and say to the system, 'save that,' meaning 'ensure I have
rapid and reliable access to that until I tell you otherwise.'
The system will decide how many copies to keep where. We shouldn't
be aware of file names in five years' time."

This also explains why you're reading an article entitled "Web
2000." The Internet as we currently know it, divided by application
software into distinct areas, like IRC and Usenet, will continue
to merge through extensions to Web protocols into one seamless
multimedia something. The closest thing that "something" will
bear resemblance to is the Web.

Web designer David Siegel, one of whose pages was a runner-up
for Cool Site of the Year, suggests that by 2000, we probably
won't even call it the Web, or even say "I'm going to go on
the Web." Consider the awkward phrases used when PCs were born
 "I'm going to do my paper on the computer" now sounds as redundant
as "I'm going to watch Babylon 5 on television."

The Web already has split into professional and amateur sites,
a gap that is likely to widen as HTML becomes increasingly
complicated and programmer-only tools-like Sun Microsystems'
Java-come online. Adobe's Acrobat and Netscape's tables have
only just begun to make the Web an attractive environment for
top graphic designers. As more artists design for the Web,
the visual sophistication of professional Web sites will increase.
As a result, amateur sites may start to look more and more
"homemade" by comparison.

OK, so maybe we can't make any grand proclamations about the
Web's impact on world culture until the 2030s. But until then,
there's a great deal of history to be made. Here, in the fields
of education, media, politics, and law and commerce, we depict
some of the changes instant worldwide distribution can bring
about.

Law and Commerce

The cobwebs are taking longer to leave your brain, as they have
ever since 1998, when caffeine became a controlled substance.
Desperate for a hit of Jolt, now only available by prescription,
you sit down at the keyboard of your NetBox and say "Tijuana,"
since you're in no shape for typing. Once inside the virtual
Mexican pharmacy, you see that they moved the Jolt. "Bring
me to Jolt," you mutter. A quick digital cash-card swipe through
the keyboard's built-in slot, and in a few hours, UPS makes
a no-questions-asked, same-day delivery.

Law and commerce have frequently met in many a cultural analysis,
but they are practically inextricable on the net. We've chosen
to combine these topics because so many of those we interviewed
did. There's a growing feeling that Internet commerce will
thrive-that is, if it isn't regulated out of existence.

The good news is that an estimated $7.2 billion online marketplace
will exist by 2000, according to Jupiter Communications' 1996
"Home Shopping Report." ($4.5 billion Web-based, $2.7 proprietary
online services.) But right now, some very ominous threats
hail from Washington. Says Mike Godwin of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation: [They] "are afraid of this new medium. The federal
government is afraid of digital cash, since the FBI has increasingly
relied on traceable transactions. Anti-pornographers like [Edwin]
Meese want to make distributors of online information liable
for that information."

Thus, ISPs can be held liable in their legal role as publishers.
For example, The WELL would be at risk simply for admonishing
people not to discuss Pentiums on a Macintosh forum. "Do we
want laws that force services into one or the other?" Godwin
asks. One solution is to try to define ISPs and proprietary
providers as "distributors," like bookstores and libraries.
"If NetGuide publishes libel, you can't sue Barnes & Noble,"
Godwin says. "Yet a mystery bookstore can make the editorial
decision not to sell science fiction."

The greatest unresolved online issue linking law and commerce
is copyright. The National Writers Union and the Writers Guild
of America are concerned about what ease of distribution (as
in information for sale online) will do to copyright law. However,
Lance Rose, an attorney who specializes in online law, won't
be a digital vendor for now: "I don't have my book up there,"
he says. Among the growing number of proposed answers to the
problem are digital payments, a proposal that makes the electronic
commerce crowd very happy. In fact, one writer has signed up
with NetCheque, one such digital payment system.

At IBM's infoMarket Internet division, Jeff Crigler, vice president
and managing director, describes the service's own solution
to the copyrights-in-commerce issue. "We were focused on the
wrong problem. It wasn't copying. It was payment assurance."
To remedy the problem, IBM has created what it calls "cryptolopes,"
encrypted capsules of information which require a recipient
to pay for data electronically before accessing it. This ensures
that the copyright holder keeps receiving payment whenever
material is re-distributed. A cryptolope functions as sort
of digital shrink-wrap-your browser can decrypt it, but every
time you send it on, "the price tag stays on it" and it must
be decrypted again-and paid for-by whomever you send it to.

Nevertheless Crigler admits, cryptolopes can make bootlegging
"very hard, but [not] impossible." He can easily see Southeast
Asian bootleggers distributing CD-ROMs of downloaded music
and videos. To help law enforcement, IBM also is working on
a digital watermark that will encode the address of the original
recipient into the material.

Politics

The NetBox has its advantages-it's always on, just like telephones
used to be, and the little dumb terminal was cheap. OK, it
was 500 bucks, but that's still less than the money you spent
on an ISDN card alone back in the '90s. Staring at the flat
panel screen, you marvel that anonymous electronic payment
has survived this long. Your thoughts are interrupted by a
Mary Hart-like blonde. "Remember to disable auto-avatars,"
you think, as she chirps on about your party's new campaign.
Funny, she looks an awful lot like the blonde the president
denied having sex with in that now-famous videoconference.

Call the White House press office to get a quote on the future
of the Web in politics and guess what? They'll tell you to
fax that request. Such moped-like activity from the folks who
stuck us with the term "information superhighway" notwithstanding,
Steven Singer of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government
is optimistic. He suggests we will see candidates reaching
much more directly to the electorate in 2000 by campaigning
to online communities, in much the same way they discovered
talk shows in the 1992 elections. Candidates might even circumvent
television's sound bites: Imagine a candidate saying, "No New
Taxes-See www.me.org!"

But if there is a greater opportunity for unfiltered communication,
the downside for candidates, says David King, also of the Kennedy
School, is that candidates lose wiggle room for issues that
weren't anticipated during the campaign. "If you can go and
find online transcripts, there's a direct comparison that tends
to become binding," King says. A further downside for the candidates
is that political reporters can go straight to the people,
too. Now, instead of printing just one or two damaging quotes,
entire documents can be placed in front of the world. Award
winning investigative reporter Steve Pizzo is already doing
just that over at Web Review (http://gnn.com/wr/)

Meanwhile, over at the Democratic National Committee, one very
wired Democrat has some thoughts on how to use the Web for
organizing. Dick Bell, the committee's interactive media specialist,
started out in the trenches-literally (he used to dig the holes
for candidates' lawn signs). Granted, nobody wants junk e-mail
coming from candidates, but he suggests that you can run listservs
from candidates' Web sites-it would be voluntary and non-intrusive.
"You can think of things for people to do sitting where they
are. If people don't have to drive to meetings, you can broaden
the base of who gets involved. If you go to a campaign office
now, you'll only see students and senior citizens. We could
finally include more working parents," Bell says.

The availability of Java and VRML likely will mean many simulations
could be run either by campaigns or online newspapers. Should
you vote for that new bond issue to expand the freeways? The
Los Angeles Times Web site could let you experience "before"
and "after" traffic congestion. Meanwhile, the downside of
such multimedia tools is obvious: It becomes even easier to
fudge data in a simulation.

Although it is unlikely to happen by 2000, one of the current
blue-sky dreams is electronic democracy. The biggest stumbling
block is that it would be too easy-for some of the population.
The concern is that election results could be skewed by those
who had to do nothing more in the middle of a freak early November
blizzard than sit down at their keyboards. Yet, we may still
see an even more divided electorate, split between those who
get their information from TV sound bites, and those who will
be able to read everything available about the issues on the
Web.

Education

Happy day! UPS just showed up. Ahhh, warm Jolt and cold pizza,
a nice traditional breakfast to start the new millennium. NetBox,
ShmetBox-that first hit has you pumped for some serious hardware.
Like that Intel P9 box you gave yourself for Christmas that's
got more power than a Cray, and weighs less than those clunky
old laptops. Synched to your 3-D video projectors, it's perfect
for entering the University Bio Lab and finishing your project
telerobotically-or knocking off a round of Doom 2000.

Secondary schools in Watchung, N.J., have wired all their classrooms,
teachers receive all their daily memos by e-mail, and parents
are clamoring to have all those permission slips and PTA notices
e-mailed home. Students in Princeton, N.J., are required to
complete a multimedia project in order to graduate-from sixth
grade. But Watchung and Princeton residents have some of the
highest per capita incomes in the country. In a country that
still bases most public school funding on property taxes, poor
communities will continue to lag behind. Even middle-class
communities feel it: Green Brook, N.J., which borders Watchung,
considered wiring its school system, until somebody actually
multiplied the cost of putting only one $2,000 PC in each classroom
in the district.

At a public meeting of the Advisory Council on the National
Information Infrastructure, the biggest question from the audience
wasn't access to the Internet-it was access to computers. Period.
Now, Compaq recently announced it will create a $500 box with
net access. Perhaps by 2000, it will actually exist. But even
at that price, it will be beyond the reach of many families.
Perhaps they will be able to rent dumb terminals connected
to servers as we once rented telephones, and be charged for
downloaded applications on a per-minute basis. Perhaps.

The situation is further complicated by infrastructure. The
only wiring in most American classrooms exists to turn on the
light switch. Yet there is optimism on the horizon. In October,
President Clinton called for "a high-tech barn raising" with
a four-point set of goals:

 Modern computers will be accessible to every student.

 Classrooms will be connected to one another and to the outside
world.

 Teachers will be ready to use and teach technology.

 Educational software will be an integral part of the curriculum.
Not surprisingly, it is expected that most of these goals will
be met with private-sector help. The president cited the state
of California, where by the end of the school year, all K-12
schools will have access to the Internet. He was referring
to Pacific Bell's Education First initiative.

Most encouraging of all is the creation of Tech Corps, a Peace
Corps for the '90s, according to its founder, Gary J. Beach.
Tech Corps seeks to enlist technical professionals as volunteers
to wire America's classrooms to further the spread of computer
literacy. Information about Tech Corps can be found on its
Web site (http://www.ustc.org)

Media

The caffeine has hit optimum cruising speed through your veins,
and you really should be working. But you're having too much
fun flirting with the other players and the professional characters
writers on Star Trek: A Generation of Deeply Spaced Voyagers.
Thank goodness for the simultaneous translation, which is helping
you get to know that girl from France. Oh, no! Now some nerd's
insisting on speaking Klingonese to her. Sigh. Some things
never change.

Dr. Clifford Neuman, an expert in authentication and creator
of the NetCheque system of digital payment, sits in his office
at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences
Institute. He views The Spot (http://www.thespot.com), an online
narrative site often likened to an Aaron Spelling TV show,
for the first time, and comments, "The Web phenomenon is very
much not the technologist's phenomenon but what the artists
did with the phenomenon. If I were asked 10 years ago, could
you use TCP/IP to send images like this, certainly the answer
was clearly yes. But if I'd been asked, 'Is this what we should
be doing with it?" he laughs. "I wouldn't have anticipated
this!"

Neither did Hollywood. Berners-Lee sums up the media's myopia

After the phrase "Interactive Television" in a correspondent's .sig 
file, he types, "an oxymoron surely. :-)" Hollywood producers
are now trying to make up for lost time, and by the time you
read this, any number of sites will have been approached and
deals made-or more likely, fallen through.

"I don't see the level of vision and commitment. I think a number
of them still feel it's going to be cable," says Guy Morris
of Cracks in the Web (http://www.cybertown.com/cybertown/cracks.html),
referring to Hollywood's persistent belief that a TV with a
set-top box will be the device of the future. "But they feel
that they should be doing something. The market is going to
get ahead of them, but they can always jump in once the market
is mature."

For Web creators, and for traditional Hollywood types, ambitions
lie in two directions. A Web site can be a relatively low-cost
way to try out new ideas for an episodic television series.
Previously, there was no other way to do that than to spend
millions to put a show on the air, and to hope for the best.
Now a cast and plotlines can be road-tested before a network
makes a major investment. Without revealing details, Scott
Zakarin, one of the creators of The Spot, confesses, "We see
doing this type of thing as lab work. [Hollywood] production
companies are talking to us about it all over the place."

Push The E-mail Envelop--It's the single most popular service
on the net-the universal application. But are you getting all
you should out of Internet e-mail?

By:
KEVIN REICHARD

How quickly we forget. Most Internet users-especially those
of us who have logged a zillion hours on the net-simply take
e-mail for granted. We've lost that sense of wonder and excitement
at the magic of messages that circle the globe in seconds.

It's a shame, since e-mail is the universal Internet service
the one that provided the initial impetus for the net's creation
and is still the most popular single online activity.

But the real bottom line is that many of us don't take full
advantage of the capabilities of Internet e-mail. We think
we're cool when we quote an original message in a reply or
attach a file to a message from time to time. But there's much
more to today's Internet e-mail. It's not a static technology;
it's evolving all the time. And you can find plenty of affordable
e-mail client software packages out there that can widen your
e-mail horizons-particularly the ones highlighted in this feature.

Great Expectations

What should you expect from an up-to-date e-mail package? For
starters, a well-organized user interface that doesn't require
a lot of time and effort to master. But that's just the beginning,
the sine qua non. Here's a list of important features that
good e-mail software provides:

Signatures: Signatures let you automatically affix a file or
text tag to every outgoing message. Multiple signatures are
nice because they allow you to attach one signature, say, to
your work messages and another to your "play" messages. And
there's no rule that says signatures have to be text-Emissary,
for example, lets you attach a GIF or JPEG file as your signature.
(If you think those florid 30-line signatures are bad, wait
until everyone starts attaching their photos to their outgoing
mail. Oooh, that shrinking bandwidth!)

Address books: Address books should allow you to store both
individual Internet users and groups or "mailing lists." A
really good Internet mail package will automatically add addresses
from incoming mail to your address book.

Attachments: Attachments-at least Internet mail attachments
actually are formatted to be part of the mail message, though
they appear separate to the end user. The most popular attachment
format is MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). A mail
package that supports MIME translates a binary file into text,
putting markers at the beginning and the end of the text. The
beginning marker contains the name of the file and the specific
type of attachment (there are MIME types for audio, binary
program files, text, and more). When a mail package receives
a message with a MIME-formatted attachment, it translates the
text back into a binary file, stores it with the file name
specified in the marker (usually while giving you the chance
to specify a new file name), and displays the name of the file
as well as its size and an icon representing its originating
application.

Two other attachment formats are in common use, both similar
to MIME. BinHex is popular in the Macintosh world, but not
well-supported in the Windows and Unix worlds. Most of the
mail packages we review also support uuencode/uudecode, an
older format still widely used in the Unix world.

Inbox/outbox: Inboxes and outboxes are de rigueur for e-mail,
of course. But a single inbox for storing accumulated messages
just doesn't cut it today. You should be able to easily create
multiple mailboxes or folders, the metaphor used by most packages.
This lets you keep all work-related messages in one box, for
example, and all personal messages in another. A really up
to-date package like Quarterdeck Messaging Center allows folders
within folders, so you can store messages in a hierarchical
fashion.

Filtering/routing: Filtering or routing lets you set up rules
for dealing automatically with incoming messages. These rules
typically key off of the subject line or some part of the address
(To:, From:, Cc:), sometimes even the message text. The range
of actions that can be carried out depends on the individual
package, though most packages with this feature at least let
you route incoming mail to a specified folder based on message
contents. For example, all mail from your boss could be routed
to your ReadFirst folder. Some of the packages add to this
capability. Eudora Pro, for instance, lets you change or create
a new subject line to both incoming and outgoing mail automatically,
or send a stock reply ("I'm on vacation," for example) to every
incoming message.

Universal mailbox: Universal mailboxes let you retrieve mail
in one place from several different sources besides the Internet.
We review two such products: E-Mail Connection (for Windows)
and Claris E-Mailer (for Macintosh)

What We Reviewed

In this roundup, we didn't attempt to look at every available
Internet e-mail package. Rather, we chose products that are
both affordable and worth your serious consideration. This
means software priced at less than $100 that provides a reasonably
complete selection of up-to-date e-mail capabilities, both
basic and advanced. (There are some first-rate corporate-style
TCP/IP mail packages-Z-Mail, for example-that sell for upwards
of $300 a pop.) Our list includes both Macintosh and Windows
applications, and one that runs under DOS as well. (The Windows
apps all run under Windows 3.1 and Win95.)

To use any of these packages, you'll need a direct connection
to the Internet, either through a dial-up SLIP or PPP account
(using accompanying software, such as Trumpet Winsock or MacTCP)
or a direct network connection. Some of these packages, such
as Emissary or Quarterdeck InternetSuite, contain the software
needed to make this connection, but most don't.

You'll also need an account on an Internet mail server that
runs either POP3 or IMAP. (The server is where your incoming
mail is stored.) IMAP is the newer of the two protocols and
offers some advanced features (both for users and system administrators)
that POP3 and the older POP2 do not. (For example, with an
IMAP server, you can choose to leave mail on the server or
download it to your local system, whereas with POP servers,
all mail is downloaded automatically when you log on.) None
of the packages we review is written specifically to take advantage
of the IMAP protocol, though all work just fine with IMAP servers,
since there's backward compatibility between IMAP and POP3.
Your service provider or system administrator may provide you
with two e-mail addresses: a POP3 or IMAP server for incoming
mail, and an SMTP server for outgoing mail. Very often, though,
these two addresses will be the same.

And speaking of service providers, some of the publishers of
packages we review here, most notably Quarterdeck Corp., have
arrangements with service providers that simplify or eliminate
many of the configuration problems encountered in connecting
directly to the Internet.

So, peruse the reviews that follow, and see our sidebars on
free e-mail ["Internet Free-Mail," page 74] and mail service
provided by commercial online services ["The Online Service
Connection," page 66], and set yourself up to get the most
out of this wonderful resource-one of the 20th century's great
contributions to communication. Oh, and don't forget to drop
us an e-mail (netmail@netguide.cmp.com). It is, after all,
ridiculously easy and inexpensive.

Claris E-Mailer

Claris E-Mailer 1.0.2 is a universal e-mail inbox, for the Macintosh
only, with links to the Internet, America Online, CompuServe,
eWorld, and RadioMail. Claris E-Mailer works from a dial-up
Internet connection (in this case, using MacTCP) to check for
messages.

Perhaps the most compelling reason to look at Claris E-Mailer
is its simplicity. You won't drown in a sea of confusing configuration
options when dealing with E-Mailer, and you'll appreciate the
tidy interface. All of E-Mailer's elements (inbox, outbox,
filing cabinet, address book) are organized by tabs in a single
browser-style interface. Moving between elements is simply
a matter of clicking the tabs.

Once you've mastered the interface, you've pretty much mastered
E-Mailer. To sort your messages, you click a column; the sorting
is keyed to the entries in that column. Click the Date column,
for instance, and the entries will appear in the order they
were received. You can sort in ascending or descending order.

The address book is similarly easy to use. You can set up both
individual and group addresses. Addresses are presented in
a single list, regardless of source (Internet, AOL, etc.).
If your address list is long, you can use the Filter feature
to locate an address by typing in the first few letters of
a name. Once you've located the desired address, you can either
create a pre-addressed message or drag and drop the address
into the message space.

E-Mailer also can be set up to process incoming mail automatically
based on the contents of the message. For instance, E-Mailer
automatically could forward all messages from a particular
correspondent to your assistant. While you're on vacation,
E-Mailer can send an "I'm on vacation" response to all incoming
messages.

And, of course, there are the things that Internet mail junkies
would expect, such as MIME attachments, quoted replies, and
automatic signatures.

For Mac-based net surfers who want an easy-to-use Internet mail
package, E-Mailer is a good choice-you'll be up and running
in no time, and with the program's powerful routing feature,
you can make sure your mail always gets delivered to the right
place.

Claris Corp.; Claris E-Mailer 1.0.2 (requires 68020-based Macintosh
or better, System 7.0 or better, 1.5 MB of RAM); $80; 800-544
8554, ext. 311; 408-987-4000; http://www.claris.com/

E-Mail Connection 3.0

Once you become more than a dabbler in the online world, you
quickly tire of switching between software packages to retrieve
your mail from the several services you inevitably find yourself
using. You writhe in despair at tracking down messages saved
among different mail packages.

That's why ConnectSoft's E-Mail Connection 3.0-the original
universal mail package-is such a powerful tool for busy Windows
based e-mail users. In addition to handling Internet mail,
it lets you send and receive mail via such services as CompuServe,
MCI Mail, America Online, and Prodigy, and/or over a local
area network using any of the popular transport protocols.
You even can use E-Mail Connection to handle your faxes.

This not only makes e-mail easy to get at, it makes mail usage
transparent to end users; you don't need to think about which
mail system you're interacting with. When E-Mail Connection
logs on to the Internet and downloads your Internet e-mail,
it's automatically sent to your inbox along with all other
incoming mail. (This is mostly a blessing, but also a minor
curse: It would be great to be able to set up multiple inboxes
and route mail to them depending on who sent it or where it
came from.) The same holds for replies: The sender's electronic
address is logged in E-Mail Connection's address book automatically,
and your reply just goes there.

E-Mail Connection compares favorably with any of the dedicated
packages reviewed here. It handles all the basic functions,
such as managing MIME file attachments, with aplomb. (For example,
a received message clearly shows all attachments by file name,
file size, and originating application.) And if you're working
with a lot of mail, you'll appreciate the advanced search capabilities.
You can search through a specific folder or all folders, seek
messages from a specific source or all e-mail sources, and
look for specific text strings in the text or the Subject field.
Finally, it's one of the few packages to offer sophisticated
message security-in this case, RSA encryption.

As for price, E-Mail Connection just makes our cutoff for affordable
Internet e-mail. But if you work a lot with e-mail from multiple
sources, you'll find that it's worth every penny. (Alternatively,
you can grab the free Version 2.5.03 of E-Mail Connection,
scaled down for Internet-only usage, from ConnectSoft's Web
site.)

Emissary

Emissary 1.00 from The Wollongong Group Inc. is like a Volkswagen
Beetle that's been outfitted with the cockpit of a Boeing 747
 There's a lot of control provided for what is essentially
a simple task, but it's the perfect setup for those who are
into precision flying.

The design philosophy behind Emissary is clear-that the distinctions
among the Web, mail, and news are mostly artificial, and that
most users would benefit from software that combines these
functions into a unified interface. By and large, this approach
succeeds, but it makes for a rather busy interface-hence the
Beetle/747 comparison.

To begin with, the modest downside of this design philosophy
 First, you have to wade through a lot of interface to get
at your mail, and second, if you're already committed to another
Web browser or newsreader, it simply may not be worth the effort
to bring Emissary onstage just for e-mail.

If the interface doesn't turn you off, though, there's a lot
to like about Emissary's holistic approach to the Internet.
All the basics are here, some executed with flair. For example,
there's a well-designed address book, complete with alias and
mailing list capabilities. If you have a lot of messages, Emissary
lets you search through them efficiently.

Other, more advanced tools can make your life even easier. These
include the automatic message filter, which can route messages
from a particular sender or with a specified subject to the
folder of your choice. You also can exercise extensive control
over how Emissary interacts with your mail server, even to
the point of specifying the lengths of timeouts if the server
fails to respond to various portions of a communications session.

There's even a diagnostic function that lists the version numbers
of your various Emissary resource files (or DLLs), a feature
that will be handier in the future as more advanced versions
of Emissary are made available.

Emissary is one of those e-mail software packages that's in
your face, challenging you to get the most out of it. And even
though you might be confused, even annoyed, by the interface
when you first encounter it, you'll find it's well worth mastering.

Eudora

Available in both Windows and Macintosh versions, Qualcomm Inc.'s
Eudora is probably the single most popular Internet e-mail
package among PC users.

A note here about Eudora's several versions: Eudora Pro is the
commercial software; Eudora Light is freely distributed by
Qualcomm Inc. at ftp.qualcomm.com and is also bundled by Netscape
Communications in its Netscape Navigator Personal Edition.
Eudora Light lacks a number of important features-such as spell
checking-that are found in Eudora Pro. Incidentally, the Macintosh
and Windows versions of Eudora are identical in both the Light
and Pro versions.

A quick tour of Eudora Pro shows why it's so popular: Installation
is a breeze. All you need to do is enter your server addresses
and your own user information. To create mail, you select New
Message and enter the appropriate addressing information (recipient,
any carbon copies, subject). If you want, you can specify a
file to be attached, and you have your choice of MIME, BinHex
(popular in the Macintosh world) or uuencode (popular in the
Unix world) formats. You also have a choice of signatures,
as Eudora supports both main and alternative signature files.
When you're done writing your mail, Eudora Pro brings up its
spelling checker and the completed message is then shipped
automatically to a mail server. Eudora will check your mail
server at regular intervals if you like, but you also can elect
to check on the spur of the moment. In addition, you can set
up Eudora Pro to route mail to specific folders, so that you
can, for instance, send all messages from your significant
other to your personal folder.

So what would make Eudora Pro perfect? For starters, a better
search mechanism, as Eudora Pro allows only for simple text
searches, and does not provide wildcards or allow you to winnow
down search criteria (such as searching only through the inbox)

If and when Qualcomm makes this improvement, it will be welcome.
Meanwhile, Eudora Pro is about as good as it gets in the Internet
e-mail world, in both its commercial and freeware incarnations
so good that you probably won't even mind the less-than-stellar
search tools.

Qualcomm Inc.; Eudora Pro 2.1.2 (requires Windows 3.1 or better,

NetShark 1.0.4

Integrating a Web browser with a mail module makes perfect sense,
as these are the two most heavily used Internet services. That's
the philosophy behind InterCon Systems Corp.'s NetShark 1.0.4,
available by download in both Windows 3.1 and Macintosh versions
which, though not identical in organization and interface details,
do offer similar features. (Be warned that this product is
updated frequently. Even as NetGuide went to press, new versions
were being posted on InterCon's Web site.)

NetShark's mail/browser integration is complete on the Mac:
To access the mail functions, you simply choose Mailbox while
in the Web browser, whereupon you can send and receive mail.
Under Windows, however, NetShark Mail and WebShark (the Web
browser) are separate, but linked, applications.

In either case, once you get to the mail package, you'll find
that NetShark Mail is a pretty complete offering. The important
Internet mail tools, like signature files and MIME attachments,
are all supported. You can sort your messages by a number of
criteria, such as date, order received, status, and subject.
And the package has some fairly advanced search tools. For
instance, you can search for all messages that either do or
don't contain a specific text string, and you can use the *
and ? wildcards to expand your search.

NetShark also provides a sophisticated set of automated processing
actions that can be applied to mail. For instance, you can
use wildcards (*) or other expressions to expand or narrow
a criterion that triggers an action. These actions can involve
automatically filing messages to specific folders, deleting
messages, or marking them as read. About the only function
it can't perform is respond automatically to every incoming
message when you're away or on vacation (a feature that Claris
E-Mailer offers)

For Mac users, NetShark is a powerful, easy-to-use mail package
that easily rivals anything else on the market. For Windows
users, the integration of mail and Web browser is a hard one
to pass up-considering the many amenities NetShark Mail offers.

Pegasus Mail

One of the neatest things about the Internet is seeing the contributions
that individuals have made to the community at large. A good
example is David Harris' creation, Pegasus Mail 2.10, which
comes in Windows, Macintosh, and DOS versions. Not only is
P-Mail a first-rate product, it's free, and Harris keeps it
up to date by regularly releasing new and more powerful versions.
You have to order the manual (for a reasonable cost), and technical
support is offered via e-mail.

Free products are inherently attractive, but P-Mail's popularity
ultimately rests on the fact that it's a pretty darn good piece
of software. Designed to run in both the Internet and Novell
NetWare environments, P-Mail has lots of power when it comes
to configuration and usage, offering features like mail filtering
(you can route all messages from Bill Clinton to a folder called
President, for instance), advanced configuration options (like
not automatically downloading mail that exceeds a certain size),
and more standard features such as signature files, spelling
checker, and quoted replies. You can choose your favorite method
of encoding outgoing attachments; MIME, uuencode, and BinHex
are all supported. It even lets you encrypt mail for better
security-still an unusual capability.

P-Mail also has a unique feature called noticeboard, which is
akin to a low-rent Lotus Notes-type bulletin board on a local
area network. With noticeboard, users can add comments to a
threaded conversation, and discussions can be nested within
other conversations. Noticeboard discussions are organized
in the same manner as mail folders, so users can switch between
them easily.

Unfortunately, P-Mail's power is hidden behind some very unhelpful
icons and a sometimes-confusing organization. Also, you'll
want to know at least a little about how networking and Internet
mail work before you tackle a P-Mail configuration. Still,
with a willing spirit (and some help from the adequate documentation),
you'll find that P-Mail is a surprisingly satisfying piece
of software.

Pegasus Mail 2.10; freeware; http://www.cuslm.ca/pegasus/

Quarterdeck

You can get lost in the Quarterdeck Message Center (which ships
as part of Quarterdeck InternetSuite 1.0), but in a good way.
Quarterdeck Corp.'s QMC offers a wealth of configuration options
beyond the basic mail tools we expect to see in an up-to-date
package.

A tour of the Preferences dialog box shows why: Don't like how
QMC is displaying the messages in your inbox? You can choose
to sort by sender, date, size, or subject. Want to poll for
new mail every minute? You can change the default setting (10
minutes) to suit your needs. Want to be notified with a beep
when mail arrives? You can add a beep. Want to set the timeouts
on your mail-server communications to make sure you're not
waiting too long for a balky server? You can tweak the default
(normally 60 seconds) to fit your technology. Want to hang
onto your trashed messages for a week or so? You can specify
the number of days mail is allowed to sit in your trash folder
before it's purged.

If some of these settings seem nit-picky, remember that for
experienced e-mail users, those minor details can make a major
difference. About the only important detail missing from QMC
is a way to search through message text for a specific string
(which is almost mandatory for those who work with lots of
messages). There's even a utility for working with TAR (Tape
ARchive) files, a Unix archiving format common on the Internet.

Of course, you don't need to be detail-oriented to get the benefits
of QMC; if you're just looking for an inexpensive, easy-to
use mail package, QMC can give you what you need right out
of the box. Quarterdeck InternetSuite as a whole is quite the
bargain, encompassing QMC as well as the highly customized
Quarterdeck Mosaic and a Winsock that's easy to configure.
If you want a quick entre into Internet e-mail, InternetSuite
should be near the top of your shopping list.

3.x or better, 20 MB free hard-disk space, 4 MB of RAM, VGA
graphics or better); $80, 310-392-9851; fax: 310-314-4217;

SPRY Mail

ou probably don't automatically think of e-mail when you think
of Internet In A Box, but SPRY Mail, its mail module, is an
easy-to-use and surprisingly full-bodied personal e-mail program
that stands quite nicely on its own. It lacks some features
business users are likely to want-routing, searching, and sorting
but if you receive a moderate volume of mail, you may find
I-Box 2.0's $80 price worth it for the mail alone.

SPRY Mail certainly won't dazzle you with a wealth of advanced
features, but it's a true load-and-go package. All the important
functions are right at your fingertips immediately on installation;
just supply the name of your mail server and SPRY Mail does
the rest. If you don't have a Winsock or TCP/IP stack installed,
you can use the dialer provided with I-Box. Once you receive
mail, you can use the handy toolbar icons to forward, print,
or reply to it. Mail storage is in standard folders.

SPRY Mail supports multiple address books, which is convenient
if you're handling a slew of addresses and want to organize
them thematically. The address book files can be copied from
machine to machine, and you can send mail to all members of
an address book at once.

Those who want to get more out of the package can delve further
into mail configurations, deciding which signature file to
use and how often to check for incoming mail. You also can
change the location of your mail inbox, which can be convenient
when using I-Box over a network.

The absence of certain features, however, makes SPRY Mail a
questionable choice for business-oriented use. For example,
there's no mechanism for searching through your messages. There's
one weakness from the personal user's point of view as well
 You have to work online. People with networked connections
probably don't care whether they're connected while they compose,
read, and reply to mail, but private users who are paying a
service provider would rather do these things offline.

Still, for right-out-of-the-box performance, SPRY Mail has few
equals. And when you want to expand your e-mail horizons, SPRY
Mail will help.

The Bottom Line

By:
Kevin Reichard

Internet e-mail is a strong, mature software field. Realistically,
any of the reviewed packages here should serve most of your
needs; we picked them that way. But these are our choices:

Cross-platform: Eudora Pro for the Mac and PC. If yours is a
mixed shop, large or small, you really can't go wrong with
Eudora Pro: Its interface is the best of the packages reviewed,
but it doesn't sacrifice any power.

Macintosh: Claris E-Mailer. While there are a few things we'd
like to see added to Claris E-Mailer-most notably a way to
search through the contents of your inbox-it's nonetheless
a solid choice for Macintosh users.

Windows: E-Mail Connection. This is the strongest package we
reviewed, both in terms of ease of use and flexibility. It's
now a truly universal inbox, encompassing both e-mail and fax
communications.

The Online Service Connection

By:
Kevin Reichard

Wide-area e-mail has been available for many years to subscribers
of dial-up online services-most notably CompuServe. Despite
the easy availability of affordable Internet connections today,
online services still handle a lot of e-mail-including Internet
e-mail. How good a job do these services do with Internet e
mail? What are the trade-offs?

You can send e-mail across the Internet from any of these online
services, and receive it, too. Furthermore, these services
have recently cleaned up their addressing schemes (a significant
bugaboo in the past), allowing you to use a "real" name for
your Internet address (like Kreichard@prodigy.com) as opposed
to vendor-assigned service IDs (like 73670,

3422 on CompuServe). On the other hand, of this group, only
America Online can match the varied features found in full
fledged Internet mail service provided by the packages reviewed
here. Here are capsule summaries of the capabilities of the
Big Five:

 America Online is the most evolved when it comes to Internet
e-mail, by virtue of its support for MIME attachments-though
it can handle only one attachment per message. In addition,
AOL effectively integrates Internet addresses into its address
book, treating them just like standard AOL addresses. Thus,
you can create mailing lists in AOL that let you send hundreds
of messages to the Internet.

 CompuServe supports only straight text in Internet e-mail messages.
It doesn't support file attachments at all, but you can send
individual binary files across CompuServe's Internet gateway
as separate messages. CompuServe subscribers use a number of
different front ends (WinCIM, MacCIM, and Golden ComPass),
so there's no standard handling of address-book matters.

 MCI Mail supports MIME-formatted text attachments to messages,
but chokes on other MIME formats, such as image or audio files.
However, MCI Mail automatically uuencodes and uudecodes file
attachments sent via the Internet. Depending on the front end
you're using (like CompuServe, the service is text-based at
its core), you can create mailing lists that incorporate Internet
addresses along with other addresses.

 Microsoft Network uses the Exchange client provided in Windows
95 to send and receive Internet mail, but doesn't fully take
advantage of it: Exchange supports MIME attachments when used
with an Internet mail server, but the Microsoft Network itself
doesn't support MIME. However, it's very convenient to have
all your e-mail centered in one client, which is the biggest
advantage of MSN and Exchange.

 Prodigy features the best message-creation tools among the
online services-its address book doesn't differentiate between
Internet and Prodigy users, and there's even a spelling checker.
However, Prodigy doesn't yet support MIME attachments, which
means you're limited to text-only messages.

Internet Free-Mail

By:
Kevin Reichard

All e-mail packages reviewed in this feature require you to
have a direct connection to the Internet, and millions of you
are paying service providers for such connections, anywhere
from $5 to $50 a month. But this is America and entrepreneurs
are vying for your business (so to speak) by offering you Internet
mail service completely free of charge.

The catch? Advertising.

At press time, two companies-FreeMark Communications, in Cambridge,
Mass. (http://www .freemark.com/), and Juno Online Services,
in New York City (http://www.juno.com/)-are busy launching
free Internet e-mail services. By the time you read this, both
expect their services to be up and running. We checked out
the interactive demos at each vendor's Web site and looked
at the beta versions of their client software.

On the face of it, these companies really do appear to be offering
free e-mail: There are no limitations on the number of messages
you can send or receive; there are no long-distance phone charges
for accessing your mail; and there are no online charges. Indeed,
even the access software is free.

In both cases, however, your every e-mail-related move will
be accompanied by some form of advertising. With FreeMark,
each message you send will be "sponsored" by an advertiser,
and the advertiser's logo will be present as you retrieve,
read, and write messages. At the bottom of both outgoing and
incoming messages, you'll find links to offers from advertisers,
online coupons, or some other promotional messages.

Advertising will be the prime source of Juno's revenue as well,
though the company promises to supplement this with some online
marketing research, too

Your Money's Worth

Technically speaking, neither system is true Internet mail.
You're not directly accessing the Internet; instead, you dial
into the FreeMark or Juno computer to upload or download mail
not unlike the MCI Mail system.

Further, you're limited by the capabilities of the proprietary
software supplied by the service providers. FreeMark isn't
planning to support file attachments, and if the online demos
are an accurate indication, neither company will support quoted
replies or signatures. The only concession to standard Internet
mail conventions will be an address book.

Finally, both services are limiting their offerings to the Windows
world, though Juno says it may develop a Mac version if there's
enough interest.

Pre-Fab Home Pages--The major online services want to give you
a space on the Web-no programming required

By:
Joel T. Patz

Early in the Internet game, getting a Web page up and running
was technically complex. You had to delve into HTML code just
to create a sentence someone could read online. Learning the
protocols for Web page layout was confusing. And how on earth
were you going to be sure that links would really take surfers
where they were supposed to go? Without a lot of dedicated
equipment-and "extra" time that few of us have-personal Web
pages were little more than a fantasy.

Well, times change and fantasies become realities. The three
major online services-America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy
have paved the way, not just to creating Web pages, but to
putting them on the Web without setting up your own server
or signing on with an Internet service provider. HTML knowledge
has been replaced by filling in the blanks, some basic word
processing skills, and simple point-and-click operations.

Prodigy

scratchpad 1.0, the tool Prodigy provides for building personal
Web pages, is available to any service member using the onliner's
browser and following the directions on its Web home page.

Getting started couldn't be easier. Simply enter your name,
a user ID (which becomes part of your personal URL), a password,
your location, and your Prodigy ID-and you're off and running
with your first Web page. You begin by giving it a title and,
as suggested in a text box that automatically appears on your
screen, supplying details you want people to know.

Suppose, for example, you're a cook and want to develop an online
recipe file. Here's your chance to share your favorite dishes
and discuss results and refinements with others. Include a
couple of your favorite food-related URLs to add interest for
your readers and click Submit. You've done it.

You can create up to seven separate Web pages on Prodigy and,
if you want, develop an index that links the items in them.
There's a template that lets you effortlessly share your 10
favorite Web sites, and another where you can profile the best
clubs, restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, museums, etc.,
in your town. Still another template lets you share details
about your business. If you're curious about how many visits
your site gets, you can add a counter to any page. (The help
file will tell you how.) It's updated automatically.

Prodigy provides an Image Library-containing animals, flags,
and signs of the zodiac, to name a few-so your page can include
graphics from the get go. A variety of symbols is available
to call attention to hypertext links, such as a MailTo symbol
for e-mail; sound and movie symbols to identify links to audio
and MPEG video clips at other sites; and even symbols to indicate
the size of an image or file to be downloaded.

And while the current version of Scratchpad doesn't let you
include video or sound clips in your pages, you can include
JPEG, GIF and virtually any type of bitmap image files.

With Scratchpad, you don't have to worry about the mysteries
of special syntax and layout provisions. The templates do away
with all major design chores. To establish a link to another
document, just fill in the URL field. Headlines, section headings,
and body text are formatted automatically. If you include your
e-mail address, Scratchpad will tag it so visitors can send
you mail simply by clicking.

That Special Touch

Copying your documents to a floppy disk (which can be done using
the Prodigy browser's Save button) lets you see the HTML tags
added to your document. You'll find this interesting and instructive.
Those who know some HTML and want to refine documents by adding
their own special touches can use the Freeform template to
paste in any material created with an HTML editor.

Some size restrictions apply to Prodigy-based personal pages
 Text boxes (individual blocks of text) are limited to about
4,600 bytes each, and a page can't contain more than 20 KB.
Each Prodigy member is allocated 1 MB of free server space
and can get up to 10 MB for an as-yet undetermined nominal
charge.

You must be logged on to the Prodigy service to build your Web
page, and the regular charges against your monthly membership
apply. If you exceed your allowable hours, the extra time is
billed to your account. In contrast, CompuServe and AOL let
you work offline to save money.

COMPUSERVE

the beta version of CompuServe's Home Page Wizard, which we
tested shortly before its release, does a first-rate job of
helping you create sophisticated-looking Web pages.

A series of dialog boxes gets you started. Give your page a
title, then fill in personal information, such as name, city
of residence, occupation, and hobbies. This data, which can
be displayed, if you choose, at the top of your home page,
is to give visitors to your site some idea of who you are.
With these prelims out of the way, you can choose to work with
either a blank page or a template-a prefabricated page that
you'll modify as you develop your own. If this is your first
Web page, templates provide a welcome assist.

Pull-down menus plus a selection of icon buttons across the
top of the screen constitute the major page-development tools.
The buttons automatically apply HTML formatting to elements
of your document. You can either click on a button to activate
its function or drag and drop it to the place on the page where
you want to work. Either way, a dialog box opens to accept
your input.

Want to create a headline? Drag the Headline icon to the top
of the page; in the Edit Headline dialog box, type your text
and click on the Styles tab to choose the desired type size
and alignment (left or center). Do the same to add body text
(except that you don't have a choice of type size). With text,
you can opt to have items centered or bulleted. Adding images
is easy, too. Choose a file from the limited selection provided
in Home Page Wizard, or import your own GIF or JPEG image.
Home Page Wizard lets you adjust image height and width by
pixels.

To forge links to other parts of your Web document, first enter
the link text, which is what visitors will click on to make
the jump; then click on the internal location, such as page
two of a multipage document. Setting up a link to another Web
site involves no more than supplying link text, typing in the
URL of the other site, and clicking OK.

If you want to get reactions and comments from your readers,
you can set up an e-mail link that provides them with a pre
addressed message form that will automatically go to your e
mailbox.

To view your page, click the Test button, which launches your
Web browser. When everything is just as you want it, click
the Publish button or select Publish Pages from the File menu.
The Publishing Wizard takes care of the rest.

The Home Page Wizard is available for free download, and CompuServe
members can place their Web pages online at no cost during
an introductory period. Remember: You'll have to pay the usual
connect time charges during the publishing, or posting, process.

AMERICA ONLINE

Compared to the fill-in-the-blanks simplicity of Prodigy's Scratchpad
offering, and the drag-and-drop richness of CompuServe's Home
Page Wizard builder, America Online's initial foray into personal
Web page building technology is problematic. The tool itself,
GNNpress, is a product of NaviSoft (a recently acquired AOL
subsidiary); we looked at a beta version. Although you can
download GNNpress from AOL, you'll need an account on GNN (Global
Network Navigator, AOL's Internet service subsidiary) to publish
your page; your AOL membership is of no use here.

Editor or Creator?

The program is billed as a combination authoring tool and Web
browser, but we found it to be more a first-generation HTML
editor than an easy-to-use Web page creator. The current version
is not intuitive for first-time users, and even fairly seasoned
Web page authors probably would prefer not to hassle with the
complexities imposed by GNNpress. For example, during our testing,
we were frequently unable to reach the GNNpress server using
its browser.

Creating a Web page with GNNpress is a lot like using a word
processor. As you work, you choose the appearance factors of
your document-heading sizes, bulleted lists, and paragraph
formatting, for example. And if you're editing a document,
just highlight text and delete it, or highlight it and begintyping
your new text.

Pull-down menus control most formatting. If you want to render
a title in bold characters, highlight it, choose Format, and
select Bold. Menu choices let you remove formatting, unlink
items, and create numbered, un-numbered, or "definition" lists
(like glossaries)

Spicing It Up

You also can draw borders around elements and include preformatted
text on your page. Dress up your page with horizontal rules
that span the entire page, but there's no way to specify their
placement or define their thickness.

GNNpress lets you create multiple pages and establish links
between them, but creating links to external Web sites, while
possible, isn't simple. To do this, you have to use the built
in browser to navigate to the desired page, click the CopyURL
button, create the link on your Web page, and paste in the
copied name. While it ensures accurate http addresses, it's
a lot of work-especially if you knew the address already.

You can build an e-mail form by copying text from a sample page
included with GNNpress, but again, there's no simple way to
create one on your own. If you wade through the HTML code,
you'll find that the mailto: command is used to do this, but
we couldn't find it explained in the documentation.

On the other hand, a number of GNNpress features are perfectly
easy to implement. For example, you can highlight a plain text
list and instantly convert it into a bulleted or numbered list.
Further, multiple text lines can be block indented (click BlockQuote
format), block indented with italics (Address format), or single
spaced (Preformatted format). Simple commands turn text into
bold, italic, underlined, or fixed pitch. And you can easily
import JPEG and GIF files.

Link-Watch

GNNpress provides one especially cool feature-the Check Links
option, which launches the GNNpress browser and checks to make
sure that all jumps are functioning as they should. The program
also includes some clip art, but it falls mostly into the bullets
and arrows category.

GNNpress' documentation is adequate, but not exceptional. Since
the help system is an HTML document rather than a Windows help
file, searching for a topic is slower than in a typical Windows
app-despite the file's table of contents. And while AOL lets
you design offline, you must be online to use the help system,
thus incurring the standard AOL fee.

Tips for Fledgling Pagemasters

By:
Joel T. Patz

As you plan your personal Web page, keep in mind the following
conventions and requirements that affect Web authors at all
levels:

 Storage space. Text doesn't take up a lot of room, but graphics
and especially sound files can eat up the disk space the provider
allots per user. Be sure to first find out what your storage
allotment is. Next, check the size of any images and sound
clips you're considering including on your page. Then you can
fiddle with the balance of space requirements to come up with
your best possible page.

 Considerate content. A Web page is not the place to insult
and alienate people. (If you must indulge in rancor, Usenet
is a more appropriate venue.) Hence, it's a good idea to avoid
potentially objectionable material, such as obscene or sexually
explicit language, bigoted or racist assertions-not to mention
anything outright illegal. Copyright infringement is another
area to be wary of: If you're using someone else's material,
make sure you're free to do so and give them credit for it.

 Design integrity. You face built-in design constraints in creating
a Web page, mostly imposed by the limitations of HTML. For
example, you can't change the font style for different paragraphs
in the same document. But as HTML continues to develop-and
HTML 3.0 is a big improvement-different backgrounds, colors,
fonts, lines, and more complex audio and graphics elements
will be added to our design palettes.

 "Browser shift." Different browsers see Web pages differently,
depending on which HTML features they support. As a result,
not everyone who views your page will necessarily see it exactly
as you do, particularly where special effects are concerned.
Some browsers might have difficulty reproducing backgrounds
and colors; tables and forms might pose a problem for others.
Solution: Test your page with several browsers. Usually, you'll
get a clear indication that major parts of a page aren't viewable
when you call it up; you might see an icon, for example, where
a full graphic display is supposed to appear.

Bridging the Gender gap--Sometimes it seems there are about
as many women online as you'd find in a Foreign Legion camp.
An expert on the topic explores some causes of the online gender
gap.

By:
JUDITH BROADHURST

The numbers are perplexing. Though women represent approximately
51 percent of the U.S. population, a recent Nielsen study shows
a 2-to-1 male/female ratio of Internet users. Other recent
studies of both online services and Internet users report that
women represent between 30 and 37 percent of total users. Though
these numbers reflect a significant improvement over 1994 statistics,
which pegged the female online population at 15 to 20 percent,
they're hardly encouraging. n One knowledgeable observer questions
the validity of the statistics. "What does that mean?" asks
Ruth Kaplan, a research assistant at the Institute for the
Future, a think tank based in Menlo Park, Calif. "Do they mean
women who have been online once? And does that mean they're
going online to download a map of San Diego because they're
going there next week, or are they participating in a Usenet
newsgroup about a health problem they have?"

On the surface, this gender gap doesn't make sense. After all,
even if you buy into the stereotype of women as technophobes,
that doesn't explain the disparity that exists even on the
easiest-to-use commercial services, such as America Online,
eWorld, and Prodigy. And even though more women are online
and using these big-name services, they're still not taking
full advantage of what's there, or using resources resourcefully.

"I can't stand the Internet. I see it as a huge time-waster,"
says a disillusioned America Online subscriber, who actually
has never used the Internet. She requests anonymity, however,
because her job requires her to eventually master such tools.

Nurture Fights Nature

Part of the reason women find themselves disenchanted with the
online experience stems from cultural influences.

Men tend to see computers as technotoys, which means fun, but
women think of them as mere machines related to work. These
contrasting mindsets developed during childhood, says Dr. Mary
Frances Stuck, a sociologist and assistant dean of arts and
sciences at the State University of New York at Oswego. "Boys
tear things apart and use them in different ways than what
they were intended for," Stuck says, "but girls tend not to
explore. They're very task-oriented."

Children often are introduced to computers by shred-em and shoot
em computer games, which turn girls off. According to a recent
Find/SVP study, however, this pattern appears to be shifting
because women-now more involved in buying and using home computers
tend to choose educational rather than game software for their
children.

Nevertheless, the prevailing attitude is still that computers
are "a male thing." "These kinds of biases are deeply ingrained
in our society," says Chuck Huff, an associate professor of
psychology at St. Olaf College, in Northfield, Minn.

And in the workplace, women largely are reticent about viewing
the computer as more than office equipment. The sample of women
we interviewed repeatedly say that they feel guilty if they
use their computers at work for anything other than what is
obviously "work." They seldom see browsing online services
for information as "real" work. Instead, many of them think
of it as the equivalent of chatting with a friend by phone
on company time.

But all that's just background for the nine principal factors
that inhibit women's online involvement. Admittedly, most of
them involve misperceptions and stereotypes:

1. Lack of time

To many women, computers are hardly a necessity. At work, differences
in time-management styles play a large part in this misperception.
"Men delegate far more, thus free up time," Stuck says. "Men
delegate, women do." And at home, "It's because women are still
doing the dishes and putting the kids to bed and doing the
errands during the evening hours when most people are online,"
says Janet Attard, who leads business forums on both GEnie
and America Online.

2. Dollars don't make sense

Then there's the combination money-indulgence factor. "Computers
are perceived as a luxury technology, and women still don't
make as much as men, even in the same jobs," says Ellen Balka,
assistant professor of women's studies at the Memorial University
of Newfoundland.

"Women are less eager to spend money on hobbies," adds Judy
Heim, author of I Lost My Baby, My Pickup, and My Guitar on
the Information Highway and Internet for Cats. "We consider
it self-indulgent. We feel guilty, thinking we really should
be spending the money on our kids or other loved ones."

3. Negative media

One of the major reasons more women are not online yet-along
with lack of time and money-is media mythology. A search for
"women" and "online services" on any magazine or newspaper
database invariably turns up a list of predictable stories
about sexual harassment, pedophiles, stalkers, cybersex, online
romances gone wrong, and the risks of using credit cards for
online shopping. These make for juicy copy, but the sensationalized
stories that distort reality have scared many women away.

4. The graphics-are-good fallacy

Graphics, though simple to use, don't necessarily offer the
allure you'd think. "I'm anti-chat and anti-graphics because
I think those are the most inefficient uses of online services,"
says Teresa Mears, a journalist, editor, and newsletter publisher
in Miami. "I use online networks to get information and make
contacts with people, and it takes more time to do that in
live chat or if you have to wait for graphics."

"More user-friendly and more graphical are not necessarily the
same. We fooled ourselves into believing that," Memorial University's
Balka says. "Fancy graphics are for marketing. They help sell
products, but they don't enhance the quality of interaction
with my colleagues."

5. Combat is not hospitable

Especially in Usenet newsgroups, women find the atmosphere hostile,
intimidating, or childish. Words like "one-upsmanship" and
"mental masturbation" come up a lot when women talk about their
impressions of online discussions. Lisa Kimball of The Meta
Network sums it up: "Women don't think of conversation as a
contact sport."

6. Technology's not a turn-on

Some men seem to equate the power of their computers with real
power, and see bandwidth, RAM, megahertz, and hard-drive size
as something akin to sexual prowess. But women are unimpressed
with technology for its own sake. As Paula Span wrote in The
Washington Post magazine, "Women treat computers like reliable
station wagons: Learn how to make them take you where you want
to go, and as long as they're functioning properly, who cares
about pistons and horsepower? Whereas guys-even those who never
learned how to change an oil filter-are enamored by computers,
want to play with them, upgrade them, fix them when they falter,
and compare theirs with the other guy's."

7. The "geek chic" stereotype

"Before I was online," says Esther Gwinnell, a psychiatrist
in Portland, Ore., "I'd imagined it as mostly people who build
computers, with pocket protectors and many pens. Boy, was I
wrong!" The techies are there, of course, but this is simply
an outdated, off-base impression that persists among the uninitiated.

8. Fear of an alien nation

Women are more worried than men that we're headed toward a society
in which people communicate mostly electronically. Many also
assume that communicating by computer is cold, impersonal,
rather weird, and the preoccupation of social misfits. Partly
to counter this, the online industry co-opted the term "community"
to hype chat rooms. Not coincidentally, that's where these
services make the most money, aside from online gaming.

"It sounds good, because it's a feel-good, '90s mentality, but
'community' in that sense is used as a marketing ploy," says
Leslie Regan Shade, a doctoral candidate at McGill University
in Ottawa, who is doing her dissertation on gender and virtual
communities.

9. Misdirected marketing

Marketers haven't figured out quite how to cater to women online.
"Women don't want to be ghettoized; they don't want a separate
set of services. If you set aside a finance forum for women,
they feel like something's missing there and go to the regular
finance forum instead," says Jodi DeLeon, product manager for
the Microsoft Network.

As Regan Shade observes, "Women don't want recipes and fashion
online. We want ways to use the technology in productive, constructive
ways. We want breast cancer information and support groups,
and sites like Virtual Sisterhood [on the Web] and the kind
of things that are coming out of the Beijing conference [the
U.N.'s Fourth International Conference on Women]. [Content
developers] think all content for women should be consumer
oriented."

What's most important to know is that women want to be talked
to as individuals, not just as women, says Carol Wallace, a
spokeswoman at Prodigy. "[Women] don't go online to have a
'woman experience'; they go online like anybody else."

Ironically, not one commercial service has made an effort to
reach out to women at women's conferences, associations, or
conventions of women business owners. Yet Echo, a small New
York City BBS founded and run by Stacy Horn, rivals all of
the multimillion-member services in percentage of women members
and half of Echo's sysops are women. Horn says she goes out
of her way to actively recruit women. "We send each new female
member a letter asking if they'd like to be assigned another
woman on Echo as a mentor," she says. "The mentors teach them
not just the commands, but the culture."

A More Integrated Future?

As women have moved into corporate management, women have influenced
the shift to the popular model of management by consensus,
which involves everybody affected in decisions. Memorial University's
Balka says she hopes for a similar humanizing influence as
more women participate online; this influence, she believes,
will result in less flaming, posturing and preening, and more
true communication.

The Institute for the Future's Kaplan adds that more conscious
choices about the content, culture, and structure of the online
world and related public policies need to be made. She and
others want to see a diversity of voices plan the Internet,
with steps taken to ensure people of all ages, genders, and
economic levels get easy, affordable online access and feel
welcome.

No medium of communication and information since the telephone
and television is likely to have such a profound impact on
education, politics, and the way we live and work as this one.
That's why it's so important that women-who are traditionally
said to be more verbally adept and better communicators-help
guide its direction rather than dismiss it all as hype and
hoopla.

On a more practical note, being online is becoming a must for
professionals. "If you're not wired or in some way reachable
online, you're going to fall out of so many informational loops
that are available," Echo's Horn says. "You used to have to
go to luncheons and cocktail parties to network. Now you have
to be online."

To be sure, men haven't posted any "No Women Allowed" signs
online. It's the sensationalized media hype, outmoded and off
base stereotypes, and plain stubborness of women themselves
that are the likely culprits.

It's not merely a matter of career consequences, or even the
growing distance between the haves and have-nots. Ultimately,
it comes down to power-but of the medium, not the machine.
Two decades ago, Michael Korda wrote in Power: How to Get It,
How to Use It: "The person who controls the computer is thus
in a singular position of power." That person gains power over
not just information, but people, he said.

Korda's book was published just three years after the first
public demonstration of what we now call the Internet, and
four years before the oldest commercial service, CompuServe,
existed. It's now up to women to put aside their own skepticism,
wariness and "yes-but" attitudes and heed his words.@

For Grrls' Eyes Only

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

There's a lack of women online, you hear? You wouldn't know
it from this New York City group.

In a loft in Manhattan's Silicon Alley, women chat as they arrange
folding chairs into rows and put out refreshments. Aliza Sherman,
wearing her Cybergrrl T-shirt, is seemingly everywhere at once,
greeting guests as they arrive to take part in a New Media
phenomenon.

This is a meeting of Webgrrls, which may be the oldest established
permanent floating organization for women in new media: It
was founded by Sherman last April. Back then, Webgrrls' first
meeting drew six participants; this meeting has drawn close
to 100. Founding the group was the culmination of Sherman's
eight years online and part of her professional commitment
to the field. (She also started CG Media, an online communications
and marketing company, a year ago.)

The purpose of Webgrrls, Sherman tells the women at the meeting,
"is to share; not to be competitive with each other, but to
offer others opportunity." Thus, the meeting is an open forum
in which each participant introduces herself, then declares
what skills, information, or support she seeks from the organization,
as well as what resources she can give in return.

In that spirit, business cards and e-mail addresses are traded
as one participant after another speaks: The Webmaster from
Scholastic needs HTML designers. Julie Denny, an Associated
Press reporter and a director/mediator with the Alliance for
Mediation & Conflict Resolution, wants to learn how to use
the Web to dig up research on conflict resolution in the workplace.
Attorneys, financial consultants, students, artists, designers,
editors, writers, techies, and the admittedly Web-clueless
are in attendance, as well as those looking for a sense of
community. "I'm looking for support from other working moms,
and I can give back my knowledge on the background and history
of the net," one woman says.

Sherman's regular e-mailings to members, as well as FeMiNa,
her "Yahoo-type" search tool of links appealing to women, and
Cybergrrls, her own Web site (http://www.cybergrrls.com/),
round out Webgrrls' resources.

It's Webgrrls' open forum, created to curb inhibitions, that
compels the group to limit its membership to women, according
to Sherman. "This is for women, about women. Women have different
needs in a group professional setting [than men do]," she says.
"This gives them an opportunity to open up in a noncompetitive
atmosphere. Women are more likely to want to share with each
other."

Does this approach seem exclusionary? "Women say, 'You're ghettoizing
us; pigeonholing us.' But not one woman who has attended these
meetings has said that," Sherman contends. In fact, Sherman
cites inquiries from women across the United States and around
the world about starting Webgrrls chapters in their own communities.

Sherman also says she's working on a survey of women on the
Web. And, despite the commonly cited statistics on the dearth
of women online, she says, "Companies should target women now
and offer them things to attract them to come online. I'm doing
this now, regardless of the numbers [of women actually online]."

FAQ: All the News That's Fit to Speak -- Talk all day if you want
all it takes is knowing the IRC code

By:
David A. Harvey

Other than searching for ways to get out of paying taxes, the
second most human of qualities separating us from the animals
is conversation. We can't get enough of it.

Digital chatter is as old as the net, but its first implementations
were limited to Talk, a grotesque one-on-one protocol run from
the Unix command line. It wasn't until 1988 that the digital
Babel known as Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, began. Designed
by Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi) as a replacement for
Talk on his BBS, the protocol and its clients spread to 60
countries and through a series of linked servers that now serve
hundreds of channels, thousands of topics, and tens of thousands
of responsive, real-time, live conversations.

For the technically curious, the workings behind IRC are defined
in the Network Working Group's Request For Comments (RFC) Number
1459 (ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/irc/support/rfc1459.txt)

What counts is that IRC allows one-to-one, one-to-many, and
many-to-many conversations. In IRC parlance, IRC itself refers
to the protocol; a server is a specific box (usually linked
to other servers) that implements the IRC protocol, along with
any server-specific rules; and a client is the software you
use to tap into IRC's scintillating discourse.

Channel Me In

The oldest and most trafficked IRC system is EFnet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu
efnet/), a cacophony of 11,000 users linked by 100 servers.

A band of netizens-sensitized to perceived privacy breeches
and lack of available bandwidth-staged an early revolt against
EFnet to form the UnderNet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/undernet
), a smaller and more tight-knit community of IRCers. On average,
UnderNet includes 27 servers and a little less than 3,000 users.

Another IRC system, DALnet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/dalnet/),
started as a role-playing-game alternative network. It's relatively
small and consequently cultish, averaging 130 users and 16
servers.

IRC networks are composed of channels, which are the equivalent
of chat rooms you can find on America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe.
These networks carry thousands of channels dedicated to topics
ranging from cooking to high-energy particle physics.

Each channel is ruled by a channel operator-called a channelop
or op. Operators must maintain topicality, rid the channel
of abusive persons, and handle basic IRC functions. There's
no limit to the number of operators; most channels have several.

Time for Good Behavior

If you jump into the middle of an IRC channel and begin hurling
insults, you're likely to be booted from the channel, flamed,
or even banned from an entire server. Anonymous IRC conversations
aren't a ticket to repealing basic etiquette.

Neither does IRC etiquette stop at the obvious. Different channels
have different purposes and different rules, so listen before
you speak. Be especially mindful of structured channels (usually
business and academic) that may be set up to hold a news conference,
host a lecture, or field a structured Q&A session.

True privacy does not exist on IRC. Anybody can see what you
type, though the latest IRC clients make it possible to hold
fairly private, one-to-one discussions. Never type in passwords,
credit card numbers, or strange commands that a "helpful" stranger
suggests.

Before diving into IRC, it would be smart to read the IRC primer
(http://mistral.enst.fr/~pioch/IRC/IRCprimer/IRCprimer/IRCprimer.ht
ml) for a thorough discussion of IRC basics. If you want to
delve deeper, zip over to an excellent compendium of IRC resources
at both http://urth.acsu.buffalo.edu/irc/WWW/ircdocs.html and
http://www.escape.com/~ward/ircstuff.html. And, if chatting
is becoming a lifestyle, head to the alt.irc.whatever newsgroups
 You'll find topics that cover everything you need to know.

Executing Conversations

Like everything on the net, IRC requires a program that massages
your information to conform to the IRC protocol. The latest
and greatest is known as an ircII client; it supports everything
from chatting to exchanging files via DCC (Direct Client to
Client), playing sounds, and zapping a URL to a Web browser.

If you run Windows or Windows 95, browse over to Stroud's Consummate
WinSock App List (http://cwsapps.texas.net/phone.html) for
a roundup of IRC programs. Other platforms are stuck checking
the otherwise lame IRC FAQ (http://www.kei.com/irc.html)

Long-time IRCers disparage anything but plain, command-line
IRC programs. Ignore them. I mean, if you really would rather
type in /WHO #Twilight_Zone and watch a list scroll by at net
speed, fine. Personally, I'd rather point and click any day
of the week.

The best and easiest-to-use IRC clients run on graphical interfaces
and offer icon-driven support for the wealth of features supported
by ircII. These clients use scripting extensively; for uptight
servers, this can be a problem.

In the lingo of IRC, a script (or any other self-maintaining
program) is called a robot, or just a bot (http://www2.undernet.org
8080/~cs93jtl/unet_bot.txt). Bots are forbidden on some servers,
so, as a result, attempting to link to one of these servers
with an advanced ircII client may be impossible. If you get
an error message exclaiming, "Bots are not allowed" when you're
using a script-driven client, try another server location.

Windows users have been blessed with a cornucopia of superb
ircII clients. Best known is mIRC (http://sunsite.nijenrode.nl
ftp/pub/mirc/index.html), a multichannel-capable program that
supports file exchange, URL launching, audio, and operator
functions through pull-down menus and buttons. Netscape recently
released Netscape Chat (http://home.netscape.com/), which is
optimized to deal with URLs. It supports standard IRC and Netscape
IRC servers.

Unix heads are in good shape: You have a slew of command-line
ircII clients with full support for both interactive-only and
scripted IRC sessions. X-Window users are served by a small
but growing number of graphical clients.

If you're on a Mac (or another operating system, like VMS or
OS/2) it's slim pickings: the mostly command-line clients,
mostly unscripted support for IRC on these OSes pale beside
Windows and Unix.

Into the Future

I have seen the future of IRC, and it is virtual interactive
3-D. But don't take my word for it-check out Worlds Inc. (http
//www.worlds.net) and its latest Worlds Chat, now at Version
8. Worlds Chat calls on all the advanced features of ircII
clients (DCC, audio, and URL launching), and adds the ability
to navigate a fully 3-D world model using an avatar stand-in.

Another new effort, AlphaWorld, is found on CompuServe (you
can also get it from Stroud's list). AlphaWorld ups the 3-D
ante to include flying around and improved scenery. Tribal
Voice's PowWow (http://www.tribal.com/) stays 2-D but adds
in tours of the Web and voice.

What is clear is that, even more than the Web, IRC is evolving
into a true virtual community. With the ability to exchange
URLs, voice and data alongside real-time conferencing, IRC
is poised to become a prime focal point for the next generation
of Web usage.

Navigator: Getting Your Small Business Online--The world can be your small
business' marketplace

By:
Kate Gerwig

From a 300-square-foot shop in Pasadena, Calif., the owners
of Hot Hot Hot run a global business, shipping more than 100
kinds of hot sauce all over the world. In the process, they're
a model for small businesses that seek to burst the confines
of locality.

Further north, from a 10-foot by 10-foot basement room, Virtual
Vineyards opened its cyberdoors 14 months ago and began shipping
wine-supplied mostly by small California wineries-worldwide.

If you're thinking about placing your small business online,
or opening a virtual business, it pays to study the practices
of those that have gone before. Both Hot Hot Hot and Virtual
Vineyards have a lot more in common than the pursuit of gastronomic
excellence. Both are small businesses that successfully sell
products over the Internet. Their Web sites are friendly, informative,
and easy to navigate, and are persuasive enough to make the
most timid of taste buds try sauces like Nuclear Hell or encourage
those who confuse zinfandel with gew rztraminer to order specials
like "$99 of Wine on the Wall."

Because all Web sites are equally accessible, startup businesses
can exist alongside the Fortune 500 on a virtually level playing
field. But only a fraction of the more than 5 million small
 and medium-sized businesses in the United States are using
the Internet as an advertising, marketing, or sales tool.

Ticket to the World

If done properly, a small business' Web site can give a one
employee shop global presence with a few clicks of a mouse.
Hot Hot Hot proprietors Monica Bosserman Lopez and Perry Lopez,
who founded their walk-in business two years ago, say sharing
information with your clients is the essence of business success
on the Web.

"If you think you can put up a Web site and just get stuff [in],
it's not going to happen," Bosserman Lopez says. "You have
to understand what works because it's a very different style
of selling. Really successful Web sites give something back."

Both the hot sauce and wine online locations let you place orders.
Hot Hot Hot's site (http://www.hot.presence.com/g/p/H3/index.html)
generated 20 percent of the company's revenue last year. Virtual
Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/), which exists only as
an online business, could be in the black in about a year,
according to company co-founder and self-described "cork dork"
Peter Granoff.

To develop a successful site, businesses first need to decide
what they want from an online location. Figure out whether
you want to enhance the company's image, generate sales leads,
or actually close sales. "You have to know who your target
market is, how you will contact users who express interest
in your product, and, if you're planning to close sales on
the net, how your customers will pay for online orders," says
Joel Maloff, an Internet consultant and author in Ann Arbor,
Mich.

Be realistic about the number of buyers vs. browsers at your
site. Bosserman Lopez says about 1 percent of the 30,000 surfers
who visit Hot Hot Hot each month actually place orders, "which
is as good as direct mail response rates."

A common lament from large and small businesses that load their
promotional materials on the Web is that nothing happens. "Just
putting up a site is like setting up shop in the middle of
a desert," Maloff says. Put your Internet address on your business
cards and stationery, he suggests. Then begin marketing your
site in ways that take advantage of the interactive medium.

At Virtual Advantage Inc. (http://www.virtualad.com/), a Web
design company in San Diego, founders Julie Bryant and Christine
Sheppard have created sites for several small businesses, which
use quizzes, competitions, cartoons, and e-mail to entice people
to revisit. "When you mess up a home page, it will be hard
to get people to come back again," Bryant says. Web pages need
to be quick, snappy, and compelling. Pages with too much text
turn visitors off.

Some Web designers have suggested that Virtual Vineyards redesign
its site using more complicated graphics. Virtual's Granoff
says he'd love to, but not until average modem speeds are faster
than 14.4 kbps. "Lots of stuff on the Internet is too rich
in graphics," he says. "If it takes you 30 minutes to access
a site, it's like inviting them into your store and then making
them wait half an hour."

Buy or Lease?

An effective Web site doesn't always come inexpensively, according
to Granoff, though he declined to say how much he's spent.
Virtual Vineyards has links on America Online and Prodigy,
a co-marketing agreement with CompuServe, and more online arrangements
in progress. The site is registered with search tools like
Yahoo and Lycos, and is thinking about doing some Web banner
advertising, Granoff says.

Still, cash-strapped businesses might be able to strike a deal.
Hot Hot Hot, for example, was able to work out a monthly payment
plan for being the first customer of Presence Information Design,
a Web design firm in Pasadena, Calif.

There are other creative ways for cash-poor small businesses
to get online. Gregory Wester, an analyst at the Boston-based
Yankee Group, suggests hooking up with an online restaurant
or shopping guide in your area. Boston's restaurant guide (http
//www.bWeb.com/) is a good example.

Some Internet access providers also have started offering special
pricing packages to small businesses. CERFnet offers small
businesses a 99-hours-for-$99 monthly package that includes
the tools for a basic, do-it-yourself Web site.

Global Village Communication Inc. (http://info.globalvillage.com
), a Sunnyvale, Calif., modem maker and Internet access provider,
has staked out the small and medium-sized business market with
turnkey net access packages that include an online template
for a plug-and-play Web site. "Most people don't have the internal
technology, so we provide a complete solution," says Steven
Eng, senior product marketing manager for Global Village's
Internet Services division. Performance Technology Inc. (http
//www.perftech.com/), in Austin, Texas, also sells a turnkey
system called Instant Internet, which provides a small-business'
network with secure Internet access via modem, ISDN, or a faster
connection.

Deciding where to store pages is another issue for small businesses.
Web pages designed by Virtual Advantage are stored for customers
on servers at CERFnet (http://www.cerfnet.com/), a California
and Arizona regional access provider. This means CERFnet's
network guarantees pages will be accessible to users seven
days a week, 24 hours a day. CERFnet spokesman Andy Markem
suggests small businesses stay out of the server purchasing
and maintenance business, comparing it to publishing a magazine
just to advertise your products and services.

Virtual Vineyards, however, owns its own server and does its
own engineering work in-house. It helps, of course, to know
that Virtual co-founder Robert Olson was an engineer at Silicon
Graphics Inc. before he shifted to the online wine arena.

Regardless of the hardware you use and the search engines you
list with, having a well-designed site may be the best advertising
you can have, according to Hot Hot Hot's Bosserman Lopez. "Other
sites will want to link to you-and your customers will come
back," she says. And that's a good step on the road to growing
a small businesses into a larger one.

Power Tools: Your Site's Got the Look--Your page can look sharp with the
right background, clip art, and icons

By:
Rich Santalesa

Take any visually rich site, strip the background out, pop the
icons off and dump the pictures out, and what remains? Basically,
the equivalent of a piece of typed paper. Plain text, plain
screen.

In any media, graphics make the difference between a merely
informative work and one packing the visual punch of a prime
Picasso. Luckily, the Web and every online service is stuffed
with useful graphic tools, libraries, and resources. If your
Web page or site is on the visually anemic side, a solid strategy
for tuning and tweaking is as simple as B, C, I.

No, BCI isn't a scandal-ridden bank. Rather it stands for Background,
Clip art, and Icons. Adding the right doses of all three can
completely make over your Web site.

Loading Up on Backgrounds

When building a house, you need a solid foundation. The same
holds for your Web site, where the page background acts as
a common foundation for your site. One of the smartest enhancements
to hit the Web, background images are an effective way to stamp
your site with a coherent corporate or personal seal.

If you haven't seen backgrounds, you're likely using an ancient
browser. When fed a small graphics file, the background tag
seamlessly tiles the graphic to create a wallpaper effect. With
the right graphic, logo or image, the results can be stunning.

Keep in mind that different platforms can and do map colors
differently. I've seen background images that looked perfectly
fine on a Mac yet were completely washed out, or displayed
unexpected colors, on a PC, and vice versa. Don't just assume
that if you see the image fine everyone else will also. Test
as much as you can with different browsers and systems.

Also, keep your background file small. A good role of thumb
is to never exceed 40 KB for any page image. If your graphic
file is larger, then consider using two separate versions-a
low-resolution image to speed loading and a high-resolution
file that can load in the background or when clicked.

For its part, Microsoft, in true Microsoft style, has added
a modification to the background command in its Internet Explorer
2.0 that lets you create what Microsoft dubs "watermarks."
A watermark is simply a background that stays put. With traditional
backgrounds, whenever you scroll the screen you scroll the
background.

By adding a bgproperties=fixed option to the background tag,
Explorer recognizes that the background image should stay put
when using a corporate logo or ad, for instance. It's easier
to visualize than to explain. For more details on Explorer
and its new tags, pop over to http://www.microsoft.com/windows
ie/ie20html.htm.

Though any GIF can be considered background material, the Web
holds many collections of background pages that should help
you in your quest for the perfect background and texture. Netscape
itself maintains a basic background collection at http://home.netscape.com
assist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.html. None of Netscape's backgrounds
will win your site an award, but they're better than nothing.

For seriously cool backgrounds, you'll need to dig a bit deeper
into the online world's art archives, or consider creating
your own images. As always, a good place to start your quest
is at the doorstep of the net's various search engines, such
as Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com), Lycos (http://www.lycos.com),
Excite (http://www.excite.com), InfoSeek (http://www.infoseek.com),
or Webcrawler (http://www.Webcrawler.com). Each has a variety
of graphic categories, and searching on the keywords backgrounds,
clip art and icons will turn up numerous pages offering backgrounds,
such as the Terry Gould graphics collection (http://www.netaccess.on.ca
~kestrel/list.html.)

Coloring Your Clip Art

Once you've fitted your page with a sizzling background, it's
time to perform some graphic fine-tuning. Using graphic elements
above and beyond backgrounds typically means turning to existing
images or clip art libraries and collections.

If you're comfortable using Photoshop or another graphics program,
it's an easy matter to whip up batches of your own images.
When you look at your page and start dancing because things
look so cool, it's a safe bet you've hit upon what you want.

An easy way to start feeling that happy foot-tingling is to
fly into the Web Weavers Warren page, which is one of the best
collections of links to graphics, backgrounds, icons and art
(http://fox.nstn.ca/~tmonk/weaver/iconimag.html). If you can't
find something of interest here, then it's time to hang up
your Web browser.

Another longtime collection of clip art is Sandra's Clipart
Server at http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/sjl/clipart.html. Most
of the images offered aren't going to set your heart fluttering,
but for graphics in a pinch Sandra's served up some filling
selections. Likewise, Grahame's Graphics for Home Pages at
http://www.computan.on.ca/~grahame/graphics.html contains hundreds
of useful buttons, icons and other graphics.

Don't overlook the obvious when searching for graphics. Checking
for art at the home pages of graphic software companies is
a smart and safe bet. For instance, MetaTools (formerly HSC)
at http://www.hsc.com, Corel at http://www.corel.com and others
display and demo a wide variety of art created with their programs.
Each also sells inexpensive, yet well-done, collections of
clip art on CD-ROM.

Icons Galore

While clip art adds context and meaning to your Web site, icons,
graphic lines and buttons provide the graphic glue to tie your
site together. As hard as it is to believe, there are people
on the Web who seem to do nothing but create free art for others
to use. Take advantage of their generosity.

For instance, a good starting point for gathering icons is,
again, the Web Weavers Warren page, or the Icon Browser page
(http://www.cli.di.unipi.it/iconbrowser/icons.html). Though
the Icon Browser page isn't well designed in terms of usage,
with a bit of effort you'll walk away with whatever you need.

Last, if you come across an icon that you simply can't live
without, send the page's owner an e-mail asking for permission
to use it. More often than not you'll be pleasantly surprised
to find the owner doesn't mind if you grab a copy for yourself,
but always ask.

Tools for All

In the end, the best sites all use some home-generated art.
If you don't already have a collection of graphic tools, converters,
and add-ons, try the following software and shareware libraries

Virtual Software Library (http://vsl.cnet.com)-a massive gathering
of 130,000 software files from the 22 largest shareware and
freeware archives on the Internet; The Father of Shareware
(http://www.halcyon.com/knopf/jim)-a site by one of the fathers
of the shareware scene that links to many other shareware collections;
and The Software Site (http://softsite.com/)-a killer collection
of software for all platforms. If you only visit one graphic
tool site, this isn't a bad choice.

Webmaster: Long-Range Web Planning -- Plan hard or watch your Web site
die. It's the new Webmaster code

By:
Jonathan Gross

Nothing moves faster than the computer industry. Yesterday's
hot system is today's ho-hum computer, and today's "standard"
is tomorrow's forgotten application programming interface.
The same rule holds true for emerging Web technologies.

During the next 12 months, Webmasters will face the difficult
task of deciding which of the up-and-coming Web technologies
should be on their sites. They'll also have to figure out how
to pay for them, and, even more vital, how to best manage it
all. Choose right and you'll ride the wave of the next year;
choose wrong and your site will be forever playing catch-up.
What do you need to keep in mind? Here are the top items to
factor into your Web planning.

HotJava

HotJava promises to bring sophisticated animation and more to
the Web via "applets," or programs written in the Java programming
language. Applets are included (like images) in HTML pages.

What does this mean to the person hosting a large Web site?
Not much, actually. Since the Java code is downloaded and run
on the client system, there is no additional overhead placed
on the host CPU. Java applets also are a bit smaller than many
images, and so the bandwidth requirements are minimal. Writing
applets, however, is a different story. If you intend to add
HotJava to your site, start scoping out the local C++ talent.

For more information, visit http://www.javasoft.com/faq2.html#g1,
or find a copy of John Decembers' book Presenting Java for
a general overview of Java.

Security

As the Internet has grown, commercial-grade security has become
vital. Whether you're talking about a firewall that protects
your entire internal network or a secure-transaction Web server,
security is never far from a Webmaster's thoughts.

As a matter of course, firewalls come in two flavors-packet
filtering and proxy-based. The correct type for your network
depends on the security decisions and policies you set. Although
the software needed to build a firewall on the Internet can
be obtained for free, configuration is a serious business-even
for the network savvy.

Turnkey firewalls that combine hardware and software as a unified
package start at around $10,000. That may seem expensive, but
it's a solid and often cost-effective alternative to piecing
together your own.

Netscape's server, as well as others, allows secure transactions
to be made between client and server, enabling credit card
orders and other sensitive information to be passed via the
HyperText Transfer Protocol. Right now there are many applications
that use credit cards as a possible method of payment. This
will be a field of development to watch closely.

Hardware and Technology

As always, outside developments in hardware and technology mean
steady planning back at the server. As faster modems replace
the existing base of V.32 and V.32bis modems, space hogs such
as video and audio files (MPEG, AVI, etc.) will begin flooding
server drives. Seriously audit your disk space usage, as well
as your line bandwidth capacity.

Control and Regulation

As the net grows, so will the need for regulation and control,
though it may not fall in the hands we'd like. For instance,
as aspects previously under government control move over to
for-profit organizations, such as the InterNIC, a $2 billion
U.S. government defense contractor in control of the root nameservers,
the Internet will change steadily. The recent imposition of
fees for domain names is one example of the type of charges
that might be imposed and gradually applied to other aspects
of the Internet. It behooves all system administrators and
Web presence providers to stay abreast of developments in the
arena.

Database Integration

If you're not running a database behind your Web pages, you're
missing one of the best Web tools around. Numerous database
solutions are available now, such as Next's WebObjects and
MiniSQL and its W3 query interface W3_mSQL, which is a single
Common Gateway Interface program that acts as a query generator.

In certain situations, storing all Web elements in a database
can be an effective way for the Webmaster to control revisions
and content, and ease the task of Web site administration.
Storing your Web contents in a database also can offer an extra
degree of security in various circumstances.

However, keep in mind that if the query engine and the database
run on the same system as your Web server, there could be a
significant draw on the CPU power of that machine. All right,
perhaps not a significant drain if you happen to be running
your Web server on an Onyx or DEC 300-MHz Alpha. But for those
of us making use of the Intel flavor of Windows NT, smaller
Sun workstations, Linux, or another desktop-sized machine,
this will be a consideration.

VRML

Virtual Reality Modeling Language is an ASCII-based language
that describes three-dimensional worlds. VRML isn't a weekend
project. Object inlining will be used in VRML even more than
in HTML documents, so the load placed on the server, especially
as multiconnection browsers are developed, will be high in
terms of bandwidth, CPU load, and, of course, disk space and
access. Large VRML worlds may have to be distributed across
several servers in order to achieve acceptable load limits.

If you are going to be implementing VRML on a large scale, you
would be wise to look into additional servers. More information
is available from the VRML Architecture Group (http://vrml.wired.com
VAG/) and the VRML Repository (http://www.sdsc.edu/SDSC/Partners
vrml/)

HTML

For almost two years, various organizations have been pushing
to create a single HTML standard. Various drafts of these proposals
have circulated: HTML+, HTML 2.0, and now HTML 3.0. But even
as these standards are argued and mulled over, non-standards,
such as Microsoft's and Netscape's extensions to HTML, are
becoming pervasive.

As America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, the Microsoft Network,
and other online services increasingly supply access to Internet
services, there will be a corresponding increase in hits by
their proprietary browsers. These browsers are mostly HTML
2.0 compliant, and are fairly picky about interpreting HTML
documents per the standards set out at the World Wide Web Consortium
(http://www.w3.org/)

To reach as many people as possible with your pages, test your
designs using as many browsers as possible. Though Netscape
is the browser king, your documents are certain to be viewed
by a number of browsers that do not cope well with Netscape
extensions. Plan accordingly.

As the end of this year looms on the horizon, make time to scope
out the year that lies ahead. Plan your network configurations
carefully, keep up with new innovations, build something worthwhile,
and most of all, have a good time doing it.

scuba diving. He can be reached at wseditor@ssc.com.

CyberGuide: COMPUTERWARE

By:
Kathleen Sands

 
INFO CENTRAL

OK, we have a confession to make. We're information junkies.
That makes the All-in-One Search Page a very dangerous place
for us. William Cross' collection of forms-based Internet search
tools has so many links to huge databases and powerful search
engines that we start salivating just thinking about it. Sure,
the site comes in handy when we're researching CyberGuide,
but it's also maddeningly distracting. Forget about getting
any real work done. We're busy looking up an old friend via
MIT's finger gateway, tracing an elusive bit of Macintosh shareware,
plugging in the local weather station's code for a temperature
check, calling up Henry V's rousing St. Crispian's Day speech
from The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, and-well, you
get the idea. But with easy access to Yahoo, Lycos, and Veronica,
along with the less-familiar net reference sites, can you blame
us? (Our only complaint: Not every form is accompanied by a
how-to-search explanation.)

OK, a second confession. We tend to put off until tomorrow what
we can do today.Maybe this site is too good for journalists
with a proclivity toward procrastination.

CyberGuide: EARTH MATTERS

By:
Rebecca Rohan

 
CRY WOLF

When the moon is full, do you check over your shoulder whenever
you hear a strange noise? Maybe all those werewolf movies have
given the Canis lupus a bad rap. According to Wolf Haven International,
"not a single documented case exists of a wolf having killed
or even severely maimed anyone in the wild."

At its Web site, Wolf Haven, a 13-year-old nonprofit organization,
provides an education about wolves as well as how to protect
and preserve them. You can get to know more than 30 of these
predators-with names like Little John, Princess Lilypad, and
Hambone. (Their cuddly photos are more likely to elicit sighs
instead of screams.) There's a program that lets you "adopt"
a wolf, too. In doing so, you'll receive an adoption certificate,
a color photo and biography of your adoptee, and a silk Wolf
Haven bookmark. Membership packages for Wolf Haven are available,
which include a quarterly magazine and unlimited visiting privileges
at the Tenino, Wash., wolf sanctuary.

Visitors to the site also are invited to attend a summer Howl
In at the sanctuary, where they can enjoy musicians, storytelling,
and a campfire marshmallow roast. Sounds like something to
howl about.

CyberGuide: GOOD READS

By:
Adam Martini

 
WRITE STUFF

Every journalist who picks up a pen or labors behind a keyboard
knows the significance of the Pulitzer Prize. Presented annually
by Columbia University-and named after Joseph Pulitzer, a renowned
publisher during the 19th century-this annual award has been
acknowledging achievements in American journalism since 1917.

Now you can read the articles that netted a select group of
journalists the coveted prize for 1995. Check out the series
by Brian Donovan and Stephanie Saul from Newsday, a Long Island,
N.Y., newspaper, that revealed disability pension abuses by
local police. It captured the Pulitzer for investigative reporting.
A distinguished example of beat reporting can be found in the
series on Washington politics and the national scene, filed
by David Shribman from The Boston Globe.

Overall, Columbia presented 14 Pulitzer prizes in the journalism
category. Unfortunately, the Letters and Drama category, consisting
of books, plays, and poetry, won't give you the pleasure of
reading winning entries. However, the sound samples from composer
Morton Gould's winning "Stringmusic," makes up for it. You'll
be sorry if you write this one off!

By:

GOING PUBLIC

If PBS Doesn't Do It, Who Will?" The Public Broadcasting Service's
new motto is a sobering one. What will massive cuts in public
television funding mean to PBS' reliable, high-quality lineup
of child- ren's, cultural, educational, nature, news, public
affairs, science, and skills programming? More pledge breaks
at the home of Mystery!, Masterpiece Theatre, and Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood? Perish the thought!

On PBS Online, you'll learn about PBS' mission and future. Take
a gander at What's on PBS?, a handy table serving monthly listings
and program home pages. Bill Nye, the Science Guy's page is
fun for kids, but Mister Rogers' page seems to be talking to
Mom and Dad. Like some educational programming, many of these
Web pages are informative, if a bit stuffy. (The Rock and Roll
page is an exception, with its animated, burning guitar!)

We vote for more original online content to complement PBS'
shows. New York City's WNET page, for instance, hosted "trumpet
virtuoso" Wynton Marsalis for a live chat in conjunction with
Marsalis On Music. Click on a map for a look at your local
PBS station and-if you're lucky-schedules and home pages.

When you venture outdoors into the cold, crisp winter air, you
want clothes that look cool but keep you warm.

Trek over to L.L. Bean's online catalog. It's loaded with easy

information. Products are neatly divided into categories for
specific outdoor activities. And handy measurement directions
and charts will assure a good fit when you place your order
by fax or phone, 24 hours a day. Sorry, no online order forms

Now that you're wearing your new Gore-Tex Day Hikers and lightweight
fleece jacket, with a pioneer pack over your shoulder and a
Pocket Survival Tool tucked in your jacket, are you all dressed
up with no place to go? L.L. Bean's detailed Park Search has
a multitude of suggestions for you: nearly 900 national parks
and forests, state parks, and other great outdoor spots across
the United States. Search by region, outdoor activity, and
season-you'll find the best places to make use of your new
apparel and accessories. Next stop, the Outdoor Sports section.
It provides helpful hints and a guide to the outdoors.

So, now that you're all set, why don't you go take a hike?

By:

DR.'S ORDERS

Good health is something most of us take for granted-until it
suddenly disappears. Sometimes, our bodies falls victim to
illness without warning. Other times, we run ourselves ragged
either too much work or too much play.

Regardless, one easy (and germ-free) way to stay healthy is
to visit Health on America Online. Here you'll find over-the
counter information on a variety of subjects, including Diet,
Exercise and Fitness, Eyes and Vision, and Men's and Women's
Health. A double-click on Eyes and Vision, for example, will
bring into focus links to relevant articles, a message board,
a chat room, and a software library for further research. This
site also offers a heavy dose of attention to AIDS and HIV,
including a daily summary with the latest news.

Many of the topics discussed at Health deal with diseases that
are out of our hands, but which can be controlled to some extent.
You'll find folders on cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis,
and learning and physical disabilities, where you can read
about how to deal with these problems and the stress that accompanies
them.

You don't need an insurance plan for a check-up on this site.

WINE AND DINE

Welcome to Sally's Place, a well-rounded site dedicated to all
the finer things in life. And what could be finer than a delicious
serving of food and fine wine? Sally will satisfy your hunger
for all of this.

"And just who is Sally?" you might ask. Sally Bernstein is a
food enthusiast-a product of French cooking schools. She is
also an experienced food critic (aren't we all?). The menu
at Sally's Place serves up a wide variety of food facts, recipes,
and articles. Recipes also are available on disk and CD-ROM.

Add spice to your next meal with cooking tips from Sally's special
guest columnists. Lovers of wine and coffee will toast the
related features. And have you ever tried cooking with tea?
It's one of the ingredients in the appetizer, main-course,
and side-dish recipes you'll find at this savory site.

If you don't feel like cooking but don't know where to go, look
up assorted restaurant reviews and listings. Vacation Destinations
will help you locate the best places to eat when you're out
of town. The topics at this Web site change often, so if you
like what you see (and taste), you're welcome to come back
for seconds.

COMMUNITY

Think globally; act locally. Have you heard the phrase so often
it's lost its meaning? Well, the Contact Center Network is
trying to bring the idea back home-to your neighborhood. The
group's home page explains its mission: to create community
based "contact centers," supported by regional and national
ones, where you can drop in, get to know your neighbors, and
find out how to contribute to causes-far away or close to home
that interest you. For a typical scenario at a center, link
to a Day in the Life.

Like the centers, the group's home page also serves as an information
clearinghouse on volunteerism, linking you to more than 2,500
directories, publications, and nonprofit organizations. You
won't find fancy graphics, just comprehensive resources simply
and sensibly arranged.

Look into international organizations such as UNICEF and Doctors
Without Borders, or browse by country. U.S. resources are arranged
by state. Have an issue in mind? Greenpeace and the Rainforest
Action Network are under Environment, and Habitat for Humanity
is under Homelessness and Housing. The Contact Center Network
plans to add a search engine to the directory. If you have
any resources, go ahead and pitch in.

CyberGuide: RELATIONSHIPS

By:
Rebecca Rohan

 
CULTURE TOUCH

What's new in weddings? Something very old. For African-American
couples planning all-out "African-centered" weddings, or for
those just wanting to sprinkle some culture into their ceremonies,
the Online African Wedding Guide explains the meaning behind
the tradition.

The guide details the responsibilities of each wedding participant.
In African weddings, for example, the best man is known as
the "warrior." Carrying a shield, his job is to protect the
bonding of the bride's and groom's families. There's also a
listing of symbols and what they represent in a marriage, including
wine, wheat, and pepper. The guide offers links to help you
pick out quality fabrics for your outfit, and tips on how to
economize on wedding expenses. You'll even find the Lord's
Prayer in Swahili. We were impressed that a few potentially
sticky, '90's-style situations were addressed: incorporating
African tradition into an interracial marriage and how to involve
children from previous marriages.

One of the sweetest symbols we found here bears a simple message
that can apply to all marriages, regardless of culture: "Love
does not get lost on its way home."

NOTABLE

Music appreciation class flashback: Scratchy records of awful
arias forced on you by a tuneless teacher who looked just like
that bust of a dead composer sitting on your class' piano.
But now you're all grown up-and you have a sneaking suspicion
there's more to life than Pearl Jam. If you're too awed by
the classical music mystique to know where to start or to ask
for help, open your ears to Classical Net, where Web maestro
Dave Lampson guides you through the "basic repertoire of works
that have, over time, become central to the Western tradition
of music, and recommended recordings/performances of these
works." You don't need a snobbish attitude or scholarly approach.
"All that is required is a desire to explore and discover new
musical territory," he says.

Explore the ethereal airs of medieval mystic Hildegarde von
Bingen, baroque master J.S. Bach's demonstration of the "Art
of the Fugue," the unabashed romanticism of Claude Debussy,
or Philip Glass' breathtakingly modern "Einstein on the Beach."
(No, Counting Crows didn't write it!) No audio archives, but
histories, composer data, searchable indexes, and links to
a symphony of net resources make Classical Net a well-orchestrated
delight.

CyberGuide: SPORTING LIFE

By:

HOOP DREAMS

Leave it to the National Basketball Association to produce a
dazzling Web page, replete with the perfect blend of game results,
team news, player profiles, transactions, and schedules. Sure,
NBA.com, the league's official home page, is a clever promotional
tool. But it also will score big points with its fans.

Complete with a library of real-time videos and sound files,
NBA.com is as breathtaking as Orlando Magic's super point guard
Anfernee Hardaway. And speaking of "Penny," check out the Player
Directory for Hardaway's vitals and career statistics (along
with the other pros')

Are you a transplanted basketball fan unable to follow your
favorite team because you live on enemy turf? NBA.com covers
all 29 teams in detail. And with feature columns on international
basketball, NBA.com reaches a worldwide audience. Other features
worth a mention are the illustrated referee guide and the NBA

It would be nice, however, to see a tribute to the legends of
the game who paved the way for today's stars and the success
of the NBA. How about a "Legend's Guide" or record book? Oh
well, you know what they say in the NBA: Nobody's perfect-except
for Michael Jordan.

Net.Dialog: Cerfing the Net -- Interconnection is the key to cooperation,
says one of the fathers of the Internet.

By:
Bob Berger

Aside from the O.J. trial, nothing inflamed the public imagination
last year like the Internet.

It popped up in every form of media, in every discussion of
business and leisure, at every cocktail party. Suddenly you
were out of touch if you weren't plugged in.

Vinton Cerf was there at the beginning. A principal programmer
for the ARPAnet project in the 1960s (a precursor to the Internet)
and a co-developer of the now-ubiquitous networking protocol
TCP/IP, he more recently served as president of the Internet
Society and was named one of People magazine's "25 Most Intriguing
Persons" in 1994. The 52-year-old Cerf was already plugged
in when some of us were in diapers.

Currently MCI's senior vice president of data architecture,
Cerf is a thin, mercurial man who seems energetic enough to
power his own laptop. He sat down at a small conference table
and talked to us practically non-stop about what has been for
him a crusade as well as a career.

Q: Is the phrase "surfing the net" derived from your last name?

A: There was a company in San Diego called General Atomics that
got into the networking business and decided to call itself
surf.net. It turns out another company in the Netherlands had
a similarly named service. So these guys called themselves
the California Educational Research Foundation Network.

Q:That spells cerf.net.

A: Exactly. Then somebody thought, "Hey, what if Vint minds?"
So I got a call and I confess that I hesitated a minute before
happily signing off on it. Soon after that, out in San Diego,
they were hawking T-shirts with "cerfing the net."

Q:Were you there for the net's birth?

A:There are different views of when things are born. Last year
there was a big celebration of the 25th anniversary of the
Internet, though ARPAnet and the Internet were kind of blurred
in that.

Q:Wasn't ARPAnet the beginning?

A:Partly. In 1969, as part of the Department of Defense, ARPA
[Advanced Research Projects Agency] was exploring packet switching
in the hope of keeping its computer networks up in case of
nuclear war. Around 1972, packet radio and packet satellite
programs also got started at ARPA, and it was only in the context
of these and other networks that the whole question of interconnection,
or "internetting," came up.

Bob Kahn, who had been one of the chief architects of ARPAnet,
recognized the need for this interconnection and came out to
Stanford, where I was teaching. He posed this problem: How
could all these things be interconnected without allowing any
of the networks to be changed or any of the host computers
to know what was going on inside the networks while being connected?

Well, we came up with TCP/IP. So I think the birth of the Internet
was 1973. Others think it started with Paul Baran's original
packet switching papers in 1962. I suspect the public thinks
it started in 1994, when it was suddenly thrust upon their
unsuspecting consciousness.

Q: You've been at this since the stone age of computers. Why
did you initially get involved?

A: I'm a programmer in my bones! I get a rush making a complex
artificial world do what I actually program it to do. Now,
imagine trying to get a diverse set of computers and networks
all over the country to internet seamlessly so that a program
running on one machine could effectively interface with a program
running on another, and without having to know what was going
on inside of either and to be robust and to work when parts
of the network were being blown up or an enemy was using jamming
devices.

Remember, this was originally intended for military applications.
Not only did I have to make it work, but work during and after
a nuclear war. Well, show me a more complicated challenge than
that!

Q:The Electronic Frontier Foundation gave you the Pioneer Award
in 1993. It seems to be the guardian of a certain morality
on the Internet. I wonder if you embrace its precepts.

A: First, let me substitute the word "ethic" for "morality."
I feel more comfortable with that.

Second, you have to realize that the origins of this whole thing
evolved in the academic community. ARPA provided the money,
but it was the academic community that did the research, which
was at first a very big problem. Every year, all these scientists
would ask for their own computers, plus they would jealously
guard their research. The situation became so competitive without
sharing that it was almost anti-productive.

Well, ARPA wanted to get more research for its buck, so it insisted
that ARPAnet be used as a tool in the research-in other words,
a way to get on the other guy's computer and run his software
on it without ferreting out his choicest secrets.

A marvelous side effect occurred. With this technological safeguard,
people started to loosen up. They started to cooperate. Frankly,
that's how you make progress in science: You share your results
so other people can validate them. In fact, that's how you
make progress anywhere. Well, this ethic of cooperating and
sharing, for the most part, continues on the Internet today.

Q: You wrote an article for the Internet Society called "Life
in a New World." How different will life in the future of cyberspace
be?

A: Very different. The net is a new infrastructure, blending
mass media and personal interaction. So we will have to learn
how to adapt our behavior and our laws to cope with that, especially
given the Internet's global qualities. Someday in the next
decade, the Internet may be comparable in size to today's telephone
network. At that scale I'll bet there'll be many, many, more
surprises-surprises we won't be able to imagine.

One day we may be wearing computers-and think of the wonderful
word play that will create: softwear, hardwear, and so forth.
And as these devices become more common, it will be quite sensible
to network them. So in the middle of the next decade, we may
have networks to download a new program for our microwave to
make it smarter about how it softens the ice cream. Things
like that.

Life will become a software rather than hardware thing-and our
human flexibility and facility and evolvability will be forced
to change dramatically to accommodate being so "plugged in."

mystery series, published by Dell.

 THREE-WAY SPLIT TO COST AT&T $4,000M


AT&T has released details of the lay-offs to be made and costs
incurred as a result of its planned reorganisation into three
companies (issue 192).

The company is to take a $6,000m charge against its fourth
quarter figures to cover the cost of its break-up, which entails
the redundancy of nearly 40,000 more employees. Around 30,000 of
the redundancies will be compulsory, following a poor response by
employees to its voluntary buy-out package at the end of last
year. Around 70% of these cuts will be made by the end of this
year, with the rest following within three years.

After tax, the charge - which covers facility close-downs and
asset write-downs as well as layoffs - will result in a charge of
$4,000m, or around $2.50 per share. As the company reported
profits of $4,700m for 1994, it may still manage a positive
result despite the charge. The charges include around $2,600m
pre-tax for redundancy pay and related costs, $1,700m in asset
write-downs, and $1,100m for closing, selling or consolidating
facilities.

Most affected by the announcement will be the company that is to
keep the AT&T name - the telephone service company - and the new
systems and technology company. AT&T Global Information
Solutions, formerly NCR, escapes relatively lightly, thanks to
the fact that it cut 8,500 people from the payroll in September.

The majority of the cuts will be in US-based operations and will
include around 100,000 corporate-wide jobs in areas such as
information systems, personnel and financial operations.

The company also plans to reduce the value of some assets,
including its Unitel Inc Canadian telecommunications venture and
several international units. It will modify some service
offerings, entailing the write-down of the value of some
proprietary software and hardware, and will also write down the
value of some unneeded network facilities such as microwave
towers and will refocus its undersea cable operations.

The cuts were in line with expectations and were well-received by
the market, where shares jumped $2.75 to $67.50 in early trading
after the announcement.

AT&T also says it is on track to file with the Securities &
Exchange Commission for an initial public offering for the
systems and technology company, and still expects to complete the
transaction by the end of the year.

 GE TO SPIN OFF EDS


Electronic Data Systems (EDS) Corp, based in Plano, Texas, could
be an independent company again as soon as the end of next month:
the US Internal Revenue Service has given its confirmation that
the proposed spin-off of the company to its Class E shareholders
by its parent General Motors (GM) Corp will be tax-free. GM
announced its intention to spin off EDS last August (issue 186)
following fruitless talks about a merger with BT Plc in May 1993
(issue 072) and Sprint Corp a year later (issue 123).

The deal still needs shareholder approval, and that could prove a
problem since GM Class E shareholders will see their shares
converted into those of the stand-alone company, but GM and Class
H holders have to approve the deal as well. Electronic Data
Systems' current market value is $25,000m, 10 times the $2,500m
the GM paid for it in 1984.

To qualify for tax-free status, the Detroit firm had to convince
the revenue men that the transaction has a legitimate business
purpose.

 ARTISOFT DIVERSIFIES WITH TRITON BUY


Tucson, Arizona-based Artisoft, Inc. has acquired Triton
Technologies Inc., a developer of remote control technology based
in Iselin, New Jersey. The cash transaction is valued at around
$11.6m.

The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase. According to
Artisoft, a "substantial" percentage of the purchase price for
Triton, and for the recently- acquired Synergy Solutions, Inc, is
attributed to in-process technology and will be charged to
operations in the current fiscal quarter.

Triton Technologies was founded in 1985. Under the CoSession
brand name, it produces remote control software allowing PCs to
be controlled remotely for OEMs including IBM Corp, NEC
Technologies Inc and Zenith Data Systems Corp. CoSession for
Windows 6.0, Triton's latest product release, began shipping
earlier late last year, offering increased file transfer rates,
multitasking capabilities and multiprotocol call waiting.
According to Artisoft, the Triton remote control technology fits
well with its recently-acquired modem/phone line sharing
technology.

Kurt Scheel, vp and cfo for Artisoft, sees the acquisition is a
natural extension to the company's strategy announced last year,
to exit the hardware business and focus on software: that
decision culminated in Artisoft's decision to divest itself of
Eagle Technologies Inc (issue 159) which it had bought it just
one year previously.

Sales channels were another reason why the fit was good,
according to Scheel - since  Triton has concentrated on OEM
sales, Artisoft feels that it can open up new markets by selling
Triton products through its existing channels, and conversely,
the deal will give Artisoft a foot in the door of the OEM market
for its existing product range.

Scheel denies that the diversification represents any de-
emphasising of Artisoft's flagship LANtastic network operating
system: "we're not de-emphasising that business so much as
diversifying our dependence on it" he says.

The US Bankruptcy Court of Georgia is in the middle of
confirmation hearings for Atlanta, Georgia-based Hayes
Microcomputer Products Inc's reorganisation plan, although it
will be some time before any decision is reached, due to factors
such as the speed of testimonies, and the US government shutdown.

Hayes representatives have been on the stand, but no decision
will be reached before the Court has also heard the alternative
plans put forward by US Robotics Inc (issue 197) and Diamond
Multimedia Systems Inc (issue 204).

The next hearing has been set for Thursday January 11th.

 NET LICENSING DEAL WITH CISCO EXPANDED


Redwood City, California-based Network Equipment Technologies
(NET) Inc has expanded its six year-old agreement with Cisco
Systems Inc by licensing the full suite of the latter's
Internetwork Operating System (IOS), and agreeing to resell the
full range of Cisco products globally. Through the original
agreement, NET licensed Cisco's router source code, which was
subsequently incorporated into the LAN/WAN Exchange module for
the company's IDNX multiservice bandwidth manager (issue 133).
NET now wants to expand that to include the other features of the
IOS, and in this way provide increased integration between its
wide area IDNX product, and Cisco-based LANs.

With this in mind, and as part of the reseller agreement, NET is
now also to make Cisco routers part of its preferred product
portfolio under its new Vista Architecture strategy (issue 184).
This agreement will also see NET providing consultancy services
for LAN design, and contract service.

While the IOS licensing agreement is indefinite, according to a
spokesman, the reseller agreement will run for two years although
NET has "every expectation that it will be renewed". Cisco was
picked as a result of its market leadership, said the spokesman,
who added that for this reason it is unlikely that NET will enter
into any similar deals with other router manufacturers.

 TYLINK OFFERS HDSL MODULE FOR MR2300


Norton, Massachussetts-based TyLink Corp has announced the
availability of an optional HDSL (high bit-rate digital
subscriber loop) Module for its MR2300 high-speed digital line
driver. The product is designed to allow users to take advantage
of their existing unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling, to
achieve data rates of up to T1 (1.544Mbps) over distances up to
12,000 feet.

According to TyLink, it works by allowing the delivery of an
outbound signal on the same pair of wires on which the return
signal is received: the transmitted signal is cancelled by the
receiver by precisely predicting the amount of signal echo and
subtracting it from the overall input signal. HDSL-based products
are designed to tolerate crosstalk and operate not only on
continuous unobstructed pairs of wires, but also on cables with
mixed wire gauges and bridge taps.

The TyLink MR2300 HDSL Module supports data rates from 672Kbps up
to 1.544Mbps, with the timing derived from an internal DTE clock.
The company says its MR2300 HDSL Module allows customers to
standardise on a single line driver for fibre-optic, STP, and UTP
applications. Different modules can be mixed and matched in a
single rack-mountable MR2300 chassis which can house up to ten
cards. Alternatively, the same modules can be used as stand-alone
units for remote sites.

The MR2300 HDSL Module costs $1,695 for the card version and
$2,695 for the stand-alone version; both are available now.

* TyLink also announced the appointment of Dick Swee as vice
president of engineering. Swee will be responsible for the
development of TyLink's entire line of digital access products.
Swee joins from UB Networks, where he held the same position.

 STRATACOM ADDS SVC SUPPORT TO BPX


San Jose, California-based StrataCom Inc has announced a new
software release for its BPX Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
switches, claiming among other things that it is the first to
support Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) across the wide area.
However, StrataCom is far from being first, since General
DataComm has had full support for SVCs on its Apex product line
(issue 161) since last September; Northern Telecom implemented it
back in June on its Magellan Vector product; and Cascade's new
500 switch (see Product News, page two) also features SVCs, and
is in beta test now with volume shipments due by the end of this
quarter - StrataCom has yet to commence beta tests of its new
release.

StrataCom says that its ATM SVCs will support ATM user-to-network
(UNI) interfaces ranging from T1/E1 (1.544Mbps/ 2.0Mbps) and
T3/E3 (45Mbps/34Mbps) up to OC-3/STM-1 (155Mbps). Support for
both UNI 3.0 and 3.1 is claimed, with translation betweeen the
two, while the company is also  planning support for ATM SVC
signalling for ATM Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed (AIMUX)
interfaces this quarter. StrataCom is also to support the Interim
Inter-Switch Signalling Protocol (IISP) for interoperability with
other vendors' ATM switches, and the Interim Local Management
Interface protocol for ATM connection management.

StrataCom is also adding new security features to its software,
including address screening of both source and destination by
port through a list of authorised or unauthorised addresses.
Additionally, the company has committed itself to implementing
the ATM security features currently under development by the ATM
Forum's Security Working Group.

 IBM DEVELOPING NEW FAST ETHERNET TECHNOLOGY


IBM Corp is working on a technology that would allow users to run
Fast Ethernet over the vast installed base of Category 3 UTP
wiring. Details are sparse, but it is thought to centre on new
repeater technology to combat the noise problems inherent with
Category 3.

On the downside, however, it is also believed to require a new
brand of network adapters which are specifically modified for the
cabling medium. IBM has presented the technology to the IEEE for
consideration as a standard, although this is unlikely to come to
fruition before next year at the earliest.

There is no word on when commercial products can be expected from
IBM.

 STARWORKS FOR HP-UX ANNOUNCED


Not content with speeding up its StarWorks system (issue 205),
Starlight Networks Inc, Mountain View, California, has
implemented its NetWare-based StarWorks digital video networking
software under HP-UX. The company has also received a major
marketing boost with the news that as a result, Hewlett-Packard
Co will bundle Starlight's software with all of its systems.

Starlight has also developed a new version of its StarWare
NetWare Loadable Module for NetWare networks, StarWare 2.0.
StarWare 2.0 costs from $5,000 for 10 users to $35,000 for 100,
and it is shipping now. A media server preconfigured with
StarWare on Hewlett's NetServer supporting 50 concurrent users
and storing 20 hours of MPEG-1 video costs $28,000.

StarWare 2.0, which supports the same clients and networking
middleware as StarWorks, will enable users to start on StarWare
on the NetServer and scale up to StarWorks for HP-UX. It will be
available in 1996. Hewlett-Packard and Starlight will develop a
Unix-based client that formats video signals for screens.

Both companies plan to integrate Starlight's video software with
other Hewlett-Packard products, and to develop enterprise
multimedia applications in video training and information-on-
demand. StarWorks has recently been implemented on IBM Corp's
RS/6000.

 NORTEL TO SELL STRUCTURED WIRING BUSINESS


Northern Telecom has agreed to sell its cable and structured
wiring business to Pittsburgh-based Cable Design Technologies
(CDT) for approximately $90m.

The deal covers Northern Telecom's communications cable and IBDN
structured network wiring business, including its DynaTraX and
OptimaX products. CDT says it will keep on all the 800-odd
employees affected by the transaction. It will acquire Northern
Telecom's Kingston, Ontario facility, and will lease around 30%
of the Laurentian and Lachine facilities in Montreal. These
Canadian operations will function as an autonomous subsidiary of
CDT.

Northern Telecom says the sale is in line with its plans,
announced some years ago, to focus on core product lines falling
under the heading of networking solutions. A spokesman commented:
"We wanted to find a partner to whom this particular business
would be core, so that all 800 people would be kept on". He said
no further divestitures were expected in the near future.

 FRANCE TELECOM MULLS POLISH LEGAL ACTION


France Telecom will start arbitration proceedings against Poland
if the government refuses to grant its Polish joint venture,
Centertel SA, licence to expand operations: its partner in the
venture, Ameritech Corp, has already begun proceedings over the
government's failure to give Centertel, now Poland's sole
cellular operator, a licence to build a digital cellular network.
France Telecom said it would start action if it did not get
agreement by the end of December. It reckons that Centertel, in
which each has a 24.5% stake, should get a licence under its 1991
letter of intent agreed the government. The government, however,
argues the letter is not binding and a new telecoms law forces it
to organise a new tender for two cellular licences.

France Telecom said it would be ready to pay a licence fee
(expected to be about $128m) as required by the tender,but
Poland's TPSA said it would not allow Centertel to join the
tender, in which applying companies had to present bids to the
communications ministry on January 3, because of high investment
costs involved.

Analysts said that even if Centertel entered the tender, its
chances would be slim, because a telecoms law envisages
demonopolisation of the telephone market. Centertel has activated
about 75,000 cellular phones since its creation in 1991 but its
high charges brought complaints it had been using its sole
operator's position to boost profit.

The government has said it will go ahead with the tender despite
the complaints; France Telecom invested $50m in Poland only
because it was sure Centertel would be allowed to expand, but
says without a digital licence it will no longer be competitive.

 JSB REFOCUSSING SEES IT BETTING ON THE CORPORATE INTRANET


Congleton, Cheshire-based JSB Computer Systems Ltd, the company
that claims it was behind the introduction of the common TCP/IP
interface Windows Socket, has refocussed its business to aim at
the corporate Intranet.

The firm, preparing to launch an integrated Intranet suite of
programs this month, is delighted that Bill Gates used the word
Intranet in his Internet strategy briefing in November. So
powerful is his word, it reckons, that between now and the end of
this month the world will have begun to clamour for Intranet
products.

Steve Purdham, managing director of JSB's European division, said
the biggest problem facing the company is educating information
technology people that the Intranet concept is simple but very
effective - and has nothing to do with Notes. He said many
companies using internal E-mail believe they already have an
Intranet, but are not harnessing the Internet-style technology to
disseminate corporate information. For example using ordinary E-
mail, the company would mail a document to all users, regardless
of its use to them. Using Web technology, the company would
merely mail users a message, telling them which Web page contains
the relevant document.

JSB's Intranet suite will consist of what the company calls an
'end user-comfortable' interface, as distinct from an icon-based
graphical interface. Purdham says the icon-based interface was
the best that could be done with low resolution screens and
existing technology, but now there is no need to be bound by it
as a standard. JSB is offering a multimedia kiosk-style
interface, written using the Internet HyperText Mark-up Language.
This approach enables users to see a photograph of their office,
with doors leading to the accounts department for example, which
they can click on for access to the accounts system on the
server. Within the accounts department they may see photographs
of an order book, an invoice book, a customer book, and then
choose which book they wish to use.

Each company can customise this interface by scanning in pictures
or photographs appropriate to its own operation. Behind the
kiosk, JSB has written its own Web browser using Mosaic Web
software licensed from Spyglass Inc. The fully integrated suite
also consists of E-mail, and the File Transfer Protocol. However
JSB said that each is available as a component, and any company
already with a Netscape Communications Corp World Wide Web
browser would still be able to use this, with other components
from JSB's suite.

The kiosk-style front end is also for sale as a separate entity.
The kiosk, available any day now, will run under Windows 3.X, 95

Sun Microsystems Inc says its Hot-Java World Wide Web browser is
on schedule for beta testing this quarter, with version 1.0 ready
next quarter. The company's problem is finding staff: currently
100-strong, the Java Products Group immediately needs 25% to 30%
more people, preferably folk that know Java - but the eminently
trainable might suffice. By this time next year, the group should

Forrester Research. The report comes amid a flurry of hype as
valuations of Netscape Communications Corp, the two-year-old Web
browser company that turned its first profit in the September
quarter and will definitely report a loss next time, soared into
the $6,200m stratosphere before slipping back a little.

The report is forecasting a $9,000m Internet infrastructure

 C&W TRIES TO HURRY YOUNG & ROSS PAYOFF


According to a report in The Daily Telegraph, Cable & Wireless is
attempting to accelerate negotiations over compensation for its
two former senior executives before a special meeting of
shareholders on January 15. Last November C&W chairman and his
arch-rival, ceo James Ross, were forced to resign after an
acrimonious board-room battle (issue 201).

The board is understood to have agreed to pay compensation to
Lord Young, although he had no service contract. The amount is
believed to be well below the #2m-#4m said to have been claimed
by Lord Young. He has been offered less than a year's salary,
along with pension entitlement and part of share options worth
#1.7m. Lord Young's pension is believed to have been fully
funded, although specialists estimate C&W will have to set aside
around #2m to provide him with a payment equivalent to a third of
last year's salary of #465,000.

James Ross, has yet to finalise his severance terms.

 COMPUSERVE MADE TO LIMIT ACCESS...


H&R Block Inc's CompuServe Inc online service provider has bowed
to pressure from the German government and temporarily suspended
worldwide access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups, in
response to a direct mandate from the prosecutor's office in
Germany. The decision was made after German government officials
investigating illegal material on the Internet, including child
pornography and other pornographic material for adults,
identified the newsgroups as illegal under German law.

CompuServe, which provides Internet access in over 100 countries,
says it does not have the capability to suspend materials on a
country-by-country basis - but the lock-out could raise big
freedom of speech issues in the US if the Germans ever get around
to enforcing their onerous laws in the same manner, because many
right-wing US news groups would likely be deemed to be
unacceptable.

The freedom of speech issues are mitigated by the fact that any
German wanting to access the banned newsgroups can simply go in
via an Internet access provider not operating in Germany.

 NETSCAPE PROMISES THERE WILL BE "DOG-FIGHT" WITH MICROSOFT


Netscape Communications Corp has promised a high-profile "dog-
fight" as Microsoft Corp unwraps a dozen Internet-related
products for what many are calling 'the platform of the future.'

The day after Microsoft's wide-ranging Internet product
announcement last month (issue 204), Netscape CEO James Barksdale
told the Price Waterhouse software industry forum in Redwood
City, California, "It will be a dog-fight, no doubt about it." He
doubted, however, that Netscape would ever have the dominance of
the Internet that Microsoft has of the operating system market:
"We don't propose that we're ever going to be the 800-pound
gorilla."

But at Microsoft's launch the day before, CEO Bill Gates was
careful to avoid the name of the one company that leads most
Internet stories. "To write Microsoft out of the Internet
equation, as many people have done, was pure lunacy," said
Stephen Auditore, President of analyst firm, Zona Research Inc.
"More important than what was said at Microsoft's announcement,
was what was not said - Netscape."

Gates wants to use Microsoft's overwhelming dominance of the
operating system sector to become a leading player on the
Internet. But Barksdale was not put out. "I think they
(Microsoft) will have to win out on features and functionality,"
he said, adding that Microsoft's operating system, which
dominates 80% of the world's computers, did not justify its claim
to be able to command whole segments of the software industry.
"Most people are tired of being obligated, controlled by,
licensed by and tied down to one company. It's a tough fight -
I'll grant you that. But we're brave," he said, introducing a
previously unknown player: "We're well financed and we believe
that God is on our side."

Separately, Netscape has announced the first winners of its 'bugs
bounty', a programme that rewards users who tell Netscape of
major faults in its software (odd that a company should so
proudly boast its underachievement). A pair of software sleuths -
Scott Weston from Australia, Paul Kocher from San Francisco -
each won $1,000 for finding security gaps in Netscape Navigator.

Weston found that Sun Microsystems Inc's on-line language
JavaScript could extract the history of a user's on-line session,
including credit card information. Cryptography expert Kocher
found holes that would enable people to crack the Public Key
encryption by timing exactly how long each encryption was taking
- a method known to reveal some encryption keys. Kocher is
currently working with Netscape to help patch the fault.

The bounty programme hastily followed September's successful hack
into the security code of the Navigator software, unearthing
supposedly secret credit card transactions. As a result of this,
the company decided to offer cash to anyone who could come up
with similar bugs in test versions of Navigator 2.0.

Thus far, Netscape claims the two winners are the only ones to
come up with significant security bugs, although it also awarded
gifts to 50 other entrants for reporting other bugs. All known
bugs are now fixed, it claims. "By rewarding users for quickly
identifying and reporting bugs back to us, this programme is
encouraging what is perhaps the most extensive, open review of
beta software in the industry," the company proudly boasted.

 AOL PREPARES FOR ITS UK LAUNCH


America On-Line Inc is gearing up for its UK launch this month
with prices low enough to give European Internet access providers
cause for concern. The European service, christened AOL UK to
avoid confusion with rivals UK Online and Europe Online, will
undercut prices severely for infrequent users of the Internet.

Exact prices are confidential, but the company claims they will
be lower than those in America, where customers pay no membership
fees, a monthly fee of $10 for five hours, and $3 for each hour
thereafter. This compares with prices among UK providers of #10
to #15 a month, many of which charge a flat start-up fee of up to
#50.

But CityScape Ltd's managing director, Clive Feather, who charges
#50 start-up, #15 a month for unlimited access and 1Mb of Web
space for subscribers, does not worry about AOL UK. "People only
need to use the Internet for 10 hours a month to make these
prices comparable to ours," he said. "Our studies suggest people
spend an hour a day on the Net."

AOL UK disagrees, suggesting an average of seven hours a month,
although it admitted to some accounts spending up to $1,500. "We
have our own therapy groups on AOL," said a spokesperson. A
merger of proprietary services, such as CompuServe Inc, with the
unregulated Internet is the future for on-line customers,
according to newly installed AOL UK md, Jonathan Bulkeley. "We're
already the largest Internet provider in the world," he said,
alluding to the four million subscribers who have access to the
World Wide Web through the AOL browser - or any other. "If you
don't like our browser, use someone else's," said Bulkeley.

In line with its US founder, AOL UK will target consumers
exclusively - "it is not our intention to target businesses,"
said Bulkeley - with a completely re-vamped interface for Europe
including the voice of actress Joanna Lumley and the ability for
consumers to publish their own pages with AOL UK's own publisher
software, NaviSoft. AOL UK will cover 80% of the UK at speeds of
28.8Kbps, with full coverage in the Spring.

EIAJ PROJECT VALUE OF 1990 PRODUCTION AT 23.90 TRILLION YEN+

     The Electronic Industries Association of Japan
(E IAJ) released its "1990 Production Forecasts for the
Japanese Electronics Industry" on December 20, 1989. This
report projects that the value of the industry's output in
1990 will rise 5.7% over the previous year to reach nearly
23.98 trillion yen. A breakdown by product category shows
that industrial electronic equipment production is expected
to expand 9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen, and will play
leading role in the overall growth of production. In terms
of value, this market will account for half of the
electronic industry's total output. Production of
electronic components and devices is expected to rise 3%,
to 7.83 trillion yen, though the rate of growth will be
lower than last year's. The forecast for consumer
electronic equipment shows production edging up only a
slight 0.9%, to just u nder 4.20 trillion yen.
    Total production of the electronics industry in 1989 is
estimated at 22.68 trillion yen, a gain of 6.7%
on the year. Meanwhile, the consumer electronic equipment
sector and general electronic components sector are not
expected to show such rosy results compared with the
forecasts made a year ago. But thanks to the growth seen
for industrial electronic equipment and semiconductors,
the overall output of the industry in 1989 is estimated to
expand pretty much as initially forecast.
    An outline of the 1989 production estimates and 1990
forecasts for the,electronics  industry is given below.

1989 Production Estimates+

      The Japanese economy sustained steady growth in
1989, supported by increased capital investment in the
private sector and strong consumer spending. The U.S. and
European economies also continued to expand, but at a
slower pace. With this economic environment as a backdrop,
the output of the Japanese electronics industry showed
robust growth.
     Looking at individual product segments, production of
industrial electronic equipment is estimated at 10.92
trillion yen, an increase of 10.2%, which reflects vigorous
capital spending. This segment is now approaching an 11
trillion yen  market in annual terms. The main driving
force behind the expansion in this sector is the
double-digit growth seen for computer equipment including
office and personal computers. Production of electronic
components and devices is estimated at 7.6 trillion yen,
a rise of 7.5% over 1988. This figure reflects sluggish
demand, from consumer electronic equipment manufactures,
despite the growth in sales of components for industrial
electronic equipment and for new multi-function,
compact product offerings. Production of consumer
electronic equipment is estimated at 4.16 trillion yen, a
drop of 2.4% from the previous year's level. This decline
is due to the downturn in domestic demand, which had shown
favorable expansion in previous years, and to increased
offshore production volumes by Japanese manufacturers. For
the first time ever, consumer electronic equipment is
expected to account for less than 20% of the electronic
industry's total output.

1990 Production Outlook+

     The annual output of the electronics industry is
projected to rise 5.7%, to nearly 23.98 yen.
     Projections made for individual product sectors
indicate that industrial electronic equipment will once
again be the leading factor behind the industry's expanding
output. Production in this sector is projected to climb
9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen. This increase reflects
vigorous capital investment plans for information systems,
including computers and communications equipment.
     Production of electronic components and
devices is expected to stand at 7.83 trillion yen, as
the annual growth rate drops off to 3.0%. This
slowdown is attributed to the bottoming out of
the growth rate for semiconductors and to
increased production of electronic equipment
overseas. These factors will more than offset the
continued expansion of demand for industrial
electronic equipment components, the growing
range of component applications and launches of
high value-added products.
    Consumer electronic equipment production is
expected to remain almost flat, edging up only by
developing new products that are tailored to 0.9%, to
4.20 trillion yen. This minuscule growth the needs of
consumers and serve to enrich their projection reflects the
continuation of expanding imports and sluggish exports due
to rising production volumes overseas, as well as the
absence of any factors that could substantially boost
domestic output. Bright spots in the outlook are expected
to include the growing popularity in the domestic
market of new products, such as camcorders and video disk
players and expanding demand both at home and abroad for
high value-added products.
     The supply-and-demand structure in the global
electronics industry is gradually being transformed
worldwide. Some of the factors at work here include the
rising offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers, the growth of competitors in the newly
industrializing economies (NIEs) of Asia and the steps
being taken to cope with integration of the EC market in
1992. Amidst these changes, the production system in the
domestic market is also undergoing a period of transition.
While future growth is expected in all product segments, it
is projected that growth differences among various market
sectors will become more obvious in 1990's production
figures.
    The following is an outline of the forecasts made for
individual product segments.

1990 Production outlook -2- +

(1) Consumer electronic equipment
     In the domestic market for consumer electronic
equipment, steady growth is expected for video equipment
owing to the spreading popularity of such new media as
satellite and high-definition broadcasting and video disk
players. Products like camcorders and CD players, which
incorporate state-of-the-art technologies, are also
projected to show strong advances. Offsetting these growth
factors will be a gradual decline in exports due to
the continued expansion of production overseas. As a
result, output of consumer electronic equipment is expected
to edge up only a slight 0.9%, to 4.2 trillion yen.
Although worldwide demand for high value-added products
will continue to advance, and there are numerous products
with excellent growth potential, these factors will not
be strong enough to boost production in the domestic
market.
     Domestic production of consumer electronic equipment
is now at a major turning point as a result of the
expanding offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers. An important challenge facing the Japanese
electronics industry in the years ahead will be to
stimulate demand by developing ne products that are
tailored to the needs of consumers and serve to enrich
their lifestyles.
(2) Industrial electronic equipment
     The 1990 forecast for industrial electronic
equipment calls for production to rise 9.4%, to 11.95
trillion yen.  The projections made individual categories
are outlined below.
     1)Radio communications systems
          Output of radio communications systems in
1990 is expected to increase 11.1%, to 987.7 billion yen.
Backed mainly by strong domestic demand, this increase will
exceed 1989's growth rate. Private-sector demand for radio
communications equipment is projected to show double-digit
growth, reflecting strong demand for car telephones, pocket
pagers and terminal equipment, as well as the increased
demand for base stations. Moreover, the launching of
private-sector communications satellites (JC-SAT and
Superbird) will usher in an era of full-fledged satellite
communications.   This is expected to stimulate increased
demand for satellite communications equipment in certain
businesses, including the education field, and also among
cable TV companies for the supply of programming. Strong
demand for radio communications systems is also expected
from the government sector, particularly from the Defense
Agency.
          Production of mobile communications equipment for
vehicles is projected to rise 19.3%, to 177.8
billion yen. This segment is expected to see the startup of
new cellular telephone companies in the Tohoku, Hokuriku
and Hokkaido regions, intensifying competition with NTT
over car telephone services and rates. This should lead to
a more active car telephone market and further penetration
of car telephone services. The MCA radio communications
sector is presently facing a line capacity shortage in the
Tokyo metropolitan area and a new system operating in the
quasimicrowave bandwidth is scheduled to be implemented in
 1990.
          Demand for marine communications equipment is
expected from the merchant shipping and shipbuilding
industries as a result of increased cargo movement due to
the economic upturn.  While demand from the Defense Agency
is projected to drop off gradually, other government
agencies are expected to place new and replacement orders
for experimental and training vessels. As a result, the
output of marine communications equipment is projected to
increase 4.8%, to 24.1 billion yen.
          Stable demand is forecast for aircraft
communications equipment, centering on the Mid Term
Defense Program of the Defense Agency.
          Production of radio application equipment is
expected to advance steadily to 285.8 billion yen, up 11%
over 1989, reflecting strong demand from the New Kansai
International Airport project, in addition to orders from
the Ministry of Transport and other government agencies.
     2)Electronic application equipment
          The forecast calls for electronic application
equipment production to increase 11.3%, to nearly 7.3
trillion yen. Within this sector, output of computers and
related equipment is expected to reach 6.36 trillion yen,
up 11.6%, about the same growth rate as In 1989. This
increase will be supported by continued active demand for
personal and office computers and other core products.
          Production of TV monitors for industrial use is
expected to show a 12% rise, climbing to 136.7 billion yen.
Supporting this growth will be a double-digit increase in
domestic demand for monitors used in supervision
applications (e.g. traffic control systems, production
lines, financial institutions and retail stores) and in
inspection and measurement applications (e.g. automation of
visual inspection systems and dimension and profile
measurement systems). Output of ultrasonic application
equipment is projected to climb to 181.9 billion yen, a
favorable advance of 10.8%, centering around medical
equipment demand.
     3) Electric measuring instrumentation
     The 1990 forecast for electric measuring
instrumentation production calls for a firm gain of 7.2%,
with output rising to 698.2 billion yen. Oscilloscopes are
expected to register double-digit growth supported by an
increase in more sophisticated models as a result of the
further penetration of digital oscilloscopes and the
development of new office automation and factory automation
equipment. However, due to the bottoming out of growth in
the semiconductor sector in 1990, demand is expected to be
sluggish for electronic tubes, semiconductors and IC
measuring devices, which, together, account for
approximately 30% of the electric measuring instrumentation
market. As a result, this market will slip to single-digit
growth in contrast to its double-digit expansion in 1989.
     4) Electronic business machines
     Production of electronic business machines is expected
to rise 6.2%, to 1.08 trillion yen, led mainly by continued
strong demand in the domestic market.
     Electronic calculators are projected to show continued
double-digit   growth, sustained by product offerings
featuring expanded functions, such as electronic memo
books, and by consumer preferences for more sophisticated
products.
     Word processor output is expected to show favorable
growth, buoyed by firm domestic demand. Copy machine
production is projected to grow favorably overall. Orders
in the domestic market are likely to rise as a result of
increased demand from small and medium-sized businesses
and replacement demand stemming from the shift to higher
grade models. This will be offset, however, by slower
export growth as Japanese manufacturers expand their
offshore production volumes. Production of cash registers
is forecast to show solid growth, supported primarily by
demand for point of sale terminals, as the special demand
for new equipment capable of handling sales tax
computations has run its course.
(3) Electronic components
     The 1990 forecast for electronic components calls for
production to rise 2.9% over the previous year, to 3.29
trillion yen. Demand is expected to remain strong for
components used in industrial electronic equipment, such
as office automation, information processing and
communications systems. A key point in this segment will be
whether the introduction of new products can rejuvenate
demand in the video and audio equipment markets.
      Passive component production is projected to show a
small 2.6% increase, rising to 1.24 trillion yen. Further
advances are expected for highdensity surface-mounted
equipment and composition technologies, in response to
changing equipment needs. Manufacturers will be working
to concentrate technologies, enhance reliability,
diversify product lines and create higher valueadded
products.
     Production of functional components is expected to
register a slight gain of 1.7%, rising to 416.4 billion
yen. The forecast for mechanical component production calls
for continued solid growth, with output rising 4.7%, to
1.07 trillion yen.
(4) Active devices
     The 1990 production forecast for active devices shows
a rise of 2.2%, with output advancing to 4.35 trillion yen.
Semiconductors, which account for nearly 80% of this
market, have tended so far to show a four-year growth
cycle. Based on past experience, 1990 is expected to be the
year when active device production bottoms out.
     In the macroeconomic picture for 1990, the U.S.
economy is expected to experience a soft landing, while
domestic demand remains strong in Japan. As a result, a
period of moderate adjustment is foreseen, with a downward
trend overall. The production trend for active components
is expected to follow this basic pattern, as a shallow
bottoming out is projected to occur in mid-1990, followed
by an upturn during the second half of the year.
     In the electronic tubes category, domestic production
is expected to shift from cathode-ray tubes for color
televisions (CRTS) to cathode-ray tubes for color displays
(CDTs). Output of the former tubes is expected to decline,
owing to expanding offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers and growing competition with the Asian NIES,
while production of the latter tubes is projected to show
steady growth due to the increase in high value-added
products. Production of display tubes, which has continued
to show relatively high growth, is expected to sustain
double-digit expansion, supported by solid demand for
industrial electronic equipment and the widening range of
applications for these tubes. As a result, output of
electronic tubes in 1990 is expected to remain firm,
registering a slight increase of 0.9%, to 684.5 billion
yen.
     Discrete semiconductor devices are projected to show a
production gain of 1.8%, rising to 665.3 billion yen. This
forecast reflects a slowdown in demand for consumer
electronic equipment, which should be partially offset by
favorable demand in the industrial electronic equipment
market.
     Production of semiconductor ICs is forecast. at
2.75 trillion yen, up 2.4%, but sharply off from the 18.7%
growth rate in 1989. While output is not likely to decline,
1990 is seen as being a period of moderate adjustment.
     MOS digital ICs are projected to show sluggish
production expansion, rising only 2.9% in 1990, far below
the 1989 growth level of 28.2%. Demand should be stimulated
by the introduction of more sophisticated microcomputer
ICs, such as 32-bit, high-speed, multi-gate devices, and
higher valuueadded memory products, including faster, more
highly integrated devices. However, the market as a whole
is expected to grow slowly because of uncertainties
regarding the supply-and-demand balance and future market
conditions.
     Output of hybrid ICs is projected to grow steadily in
1990 to 252.5 billion yen, an increase of 5.4% over 1989.
Because of the nature of custom-made products, demand is
not expected to be influenced significantly by overall
market conditions.
     Production of liquid crystal devices is pro jected to
show strong growth of 27.7%, climbing to 185.6 billion yen.
This favorable expansion will be supported by the rapid
shift from watch and calculator applications to large LCDs
for personal computers, word processors and other products.
Another supporting factor will be the growing demand for
color LCD devices.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INTRODUCTION OF THREE NEW DIGITAL RADIO SYSTEMS+

    -- Technical Requirements for Introduction of
three New Digital Radio Systems --

On January 22, the Telecommunications Technol-
ogy Council (TTC) submitted its final report to
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
concerning "Technical Requirements for Fixed
Digital Microwave Radio Networks". The report
recommends the introduction of three new sys-
tems: a medium-capacity systqm that provides
increased circuit capacity for public service net-
works, a system for telecommunications enter-
prises that uses the existing submicrowave band,
and a new small-capacity system to replace the
current public service system.
       Microwave radio is used for private communi-
cation, by national and municipal self-governing
bodies and public   institutions for disaster preven-
tion and maintenance of public order, and by commercial
entities for provision of electric power, gas and railway
communications. At present, public service have practical
use of up to the telephone circuit equivalent of 576
channels. However, in order to respond to the recent rapid
increase in amounts of information transmitted and the
need for image transmission due to integration of social
activities and the developing information society, the
introduction of a new radio system that provides about 1.5
times larger capacity than the existing system is desired.
      In addition, due to the rapid increase in demand for
mobile communication, as well as for car telephone service,
there is a significant shortage of available frequencies
for mobile communication service, so use of part of the
submicrowave band (2 GHz band) is being considered for
mobile communication service. Therefore, it has become
necessary to sequentially shift the small-capacity,
fixed circuits used for telecommunication service and
public service in the submicrowave band to higher
frequencies. For these reasons, the Teleommunications
Technology Council concluded in its final report that the
technical requirements for introduction of three new
systems should be as listed in Table 1.
      For telecommunication service use, however, a
large-capacity digital radio system that utilizes the
world's first 256 quadrature amplitude modulation system,
an epoch making technology developed by NTT, has been in
operation since December of last year.

NTT Pocket Pagers Pass the 3 Million Unit Mark+

     NTT recently announced that, as of the end of December
1989, the number of subscriptions for its pocket pager
services broke the 3 million level. (Total subscriptions
for the 30 new pocket pager companies: 1.05 million.)
      NTT's pocket pager service started in the 23  wards
of Tokyo in July 1968, was extended to Osaka in 1969, and
to Nagoya and Yokohama in 1970. At present, it is available
in most cities throughout Japan.
     The number of pocket pager subscriptions  exceeded 0.5
million in FY '75, reached 1 million in FY '80, passed 2
million in FY '85, then broke the 3 million level at the
end of December last year.
      Introduction of new services included the  start of
dual-call service in 1982, numeric-display pocket pagers in
April 1987, and fixed-statement display, pen-type and
card-type pagers in December 1988. There have also been
reductions in usage charges and deposits. In addition.
NTT had been developing various new services, such as
multi-area service, since November of last year.
     A breakdown of the 3 million subscriptions shows that
about two thirds of them are for "call only" (tone-only)
service, but there has recently been a significant increase
in the number of subscriptions for numeric-display and
pen-type pagers.
      NTT is planning to reduce its monthly charges for
pocket pager service on March 1 of this year. Charges for
tone-only service will be reduced from 2,500 yen to 2,000
yen, for numeric-display service from 2,900 yen to 2,600
yen, and fixedstatement-display service from 3,300 yen to
2,900 yen. In addition, those subscribers with contracts
for 31 or more units, will no longer have to pay a  deposit
for the 31st and succeeding sets. The monthly charge for
dual-call service will be reduced to 100 yen from the
current 250 yen, and from 1,700 yen to 1,400 yen for
portable receivers.

NTT to Purchase Base Station Transmitters for
 Pocket Paging Service from Quintron of the U.S.+

      On February 5, NTT announced that it will  purchase
base station transmitters for radio paging service from
Quintron Corporation of the U.S., marking the first time
for the company to buy pocket paging service equipment from
a foreign source. The procurement announcement was placed
in Kampo, the Government Gazette, on December 21,' 1989 to
solicit additional suppliers and, based on technological
and price considerations, Quintron was selected, The
procurement order is expected to amount to about 400
million yen per year for Quintron.
      At present, NTT provides pocket paging service to
more than three million subscribers throughout Japan. The
equipment to be procured from Quintron will be set up at
radio base stations in certain service districts to send
information to pocket pagers carried by users.
     Quintron 'is an exclusive manufacturer and developer
of base station transmitters for radio paging service,
etc., and has its headquarters in Quincy, Illinois. The
company became a whollyowned subsidiary of Glenayre
Electronics Ltd. of Canada last year. Quintron products are
highly respected for both quality and reliability in the
U.S. market.                                (No. 103-2-3)

NTT Succeeds in Trial Production of Miniature
High-Performance Optical Fiber Amplifier+

      On January 25, NTT announced that it has succeeded in
the trial production of a miniature highperformance optical
fiber amplifier with an amplification factor exceeding
2,000.
     NTT has been conducting research on optical fiber
amplifiers to enable direct amplification of optical
signals through the use of optical fiber injected with
erbium (erbium-doped fiber). Thus, NTT's prototype system
uses erbium-doped fiber manufactured using vapor-phase
axial deposition (VAD) technology developed by NTT for
production of low-loss optical fiber and a newly devel-
oped semiconductor laser to supply energy to the optical
fiber amplifier. The volume of the prototype device is 36
cc, which is about one third the size of a pack of
cigarettes.
     When this amplifier is put to practical use, it can
easily be set up in a narrow space, such as inside optical
transmission equipment or optical relay devices. It is also
expected to contribute significantly to the extending of
relay distance and to the increasing of transmission speed
to the ultrahigh-speed range. With its broad general
purpose capabilities, this amplifier should have a wide
application range, including CATV and various optical
measuring installations.
     NTT has already succeeded in doubling the repeater
spacing (to 212 kilometers) of its current optical
transmission system using an optical fiber amplifier at 1.8
Gb/s, which proves the effectiveness of optical fiber
amplifiers.             (No. 103-2-4)

Recent Trends at KDD
    -- KDD to jointly Offer Port-PLAN with BT and MCI-- +

      On February 6, KDD announced that it has concluded
agreements with BT of England and MCI of the U.S. for the
joint offering of Port-PLAN (company communication network
service) and will start providing that service from the
middle of this year.
     According to the agreements, both BT and MCI will set
up digital voice switching devices (ICXs), which KDD was
the first in the world to develop, as their core facilities
for this service. The ICX is a switching system that
provides for various  type of communication, such as
facsimile and voice communication, as well as message
communication. The system enables construction of an
economical international incompany communication network
that can easily and quickly respond to user demand using
facilities installed in KDD, BT and MCI, without the
Port-PLAN user being required to posses related facilities
normally required for an international communication
network.
     Port-PLAN is a ready-made network service that
utilizes a previously established KDD leased circuit
service in response to user's demand, and was started on
August 1, 1989.
     Until now, in order to utilize Port-PLAN, the user had
to provide his own facilities on the overseas side.
Now, however, the offering of PortPLAN by BT and MCI makes
it possible for the application of a global network that
integrates various communication media in three countries
(Japan, England and the U.S.A.). In addition, maintenance
of the network is provided on a 24 hour basis for the
highest reliability.
     The leased system that is the core for the network
provides individual ports and trunks by media, including
voice, facsimile, data and teletype, with each leased
system connected by high-speed digital leased circuits
(Hi-BITLINK), which has extremely high reliability. Users
can easily and quickly construct a leased network just by
connection through a domestic circuit to the center facil-
ity in each country. In addition, the system can flexibly
respond to an increase or decrease in the amount Of
communication handled , or expand/update the network
configuration just by changing ports or trunks, thus
allowing users to apply the communication system that most
economically merits their demand. The leased system for the
overseas side are set up in London and Piscataway, New
Jersey.

--PC ISDN Board Compatible with OSI Communication
              and VAX ISDN Board Put to Practical Use--+

     On January 31, KDD announced that it had succeeded in
developing and putting to practical use the world's first
ISDN board compatible with personal computer OSI
communication, which enables communication between
different types of computers by connecting with ISDN. KDD
has also succeeded in putting to practical use Japan's
first ISDN board for the VAX minicomputers produced by DEC.
The board enables communcation between VAX units or
terminals in remote areas through ISDN.
    OSI Plus Corp., a KDD subsidiary, has been charged with
commercialization of both ISDN boards, with sales starting
on February 1.
     A description of the two boards follows.
(1) OSI-compatible PC ISDN board
     When combined with an OSI layer 5 board, which is
already commercially available, this board enables the use
of an all-purpose personal computer for OSI communication,
including high-speed file transfer and message
communication, through KDD's international ISDN service
or NTT's INS-Net 64. It also provides for multi-media
communication by simultaneous communication of voice and
data or voice and images, through the use of two B channels
(Refer to Figures 1, 2).
     OSI Plus Corp., the original distributor, has combined
this board with an OSI layer 5 board and will sell the
combined unit as "u-OSI/ISDN". It consists of two boards,
each with its own CPU, and must be installed in two
expansion slots in the personal computer for use. At
present boards are only available for, NEC 9801 Series
computers, but boards for other personal computers and work
stations are under development. The unit is priced at
590,000 yen, with shipping scheduled to start on May 1.
(2) VAX ISDN board
     This board was developed by KDD in cooperation with
ABIT Corp. It provides for direct connection to DEC's VAX
mini-computer, which is in use throughout the world, and is
simply installed in an expansion slot in the VAX. enables
high-speed file transfer and host access with VAX or other
terminals through an ISDN from the terminal or a telephone
coupler connected to the VAX or directly to the board.
(Refer to Figure 3).
     OSI Plus sells this board as a "VIT1000 ISDN Interface
Board", and it is priced at 800,000 yen for the basic
system, which includes the main board, an expansion
interface box and accessories. Various options are also
available, including a 64/56 Kb/s V.11 interface unit
(25,000 yen) and a 4-board asynchronous interface expansion
unlit (100,000 yen). Shipping is expected to start on April
2.
     The DEC minicomputers with which the VIT1000 can be
used include the Micro VAX Series and the VAX Station
Series. The product can be used to construct a broadband
LAN through an ISDN by connecting VAX networks or LANs that
use the VAX.              (No. 103-2-6)

--KDD joint U.S. INFONET by Investment by Investment--+

      On January 11, KDD announced that it has obtained a 5%
share of INFONET Service Corp., a U.S. data communication
company whose other stock holders are major
telecommunication carriers in Europe and the Asia/Pacific
region, from Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a U.S.
information communication software company. KDD will also
dispatch one executive to join the company. This
joining-by-investment will allow KDD to respond more
flexibly to demands for international data communication
service in cooperation with the other telecommunication
carriers that are already stockholders in the company.
     Currently, Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co. (MKI), a
subsidiary of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., is offering INFONET
service in Japan. However, KDD is studying possible methods
of offering INFONET service in the future in cooperation
with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and MKI.
     INFONET Service Corp. was established in 1970 as a
division of CSC. At present, it provides data communication
and information processing services both inside the U.S.
and internationally. In 1988, INFONET separated from CSC
and became an independent company, and telecommunication
carriers in Europe and the Asia/Oceania region have been
joining the company by investment in succession. With
KDD's investment at this time, major telecommunications
carriers in the U.S., Europe and the Asia and Pacific
region will jointly own and operate INFONET.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Develops High-Capacity,
Compact Central Earth Station for Video and Data Signals+

      On January 16, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
announced that it had developed a compact, high-
performance radio system for use in satellite com-
munication central earth stations. The new radio
system gives the central earth stations the capabil-
ity to transmit both video and data signals, as well
as increasing maintainability.
    The system is capable of transmitting multiple
carrier data signals and a broadband video signal at
the same time, so it is expected to have positive
effect on the promotion and diffusion of satellite-
based multimedia communication networks, which
are considered to have serious potential in the
future. Until now, it has been necessary to transmit
and receive the two types of signals using separate
systems.
    The satellite communication central earth
station provides the core functions for the data
communication network and controls the network,
which is composed of multiple VSATS. Therefore,
the equipment used must provide high perform-
ance and be highly reliable. Recently, there has
also been increasing demand for reduction of
required installation space. That is, what is
required now is a more compact system with
increased maintainability.
    The same is true for satellite-based multi-
media communication networks. That is, construc-
tion of such a system requires development of
a small earth station capable of transmitting both
multiple carrier data signals and a broadband video
signals.
    Matsushita's new system has been developed
in response to these requirements. Its primary
features include (1) a compact system with excel-
lent maintainability that can be set up and
operated in simple mini-shelters. (2) capability
to simultaneously transmit both data and video
signals for construction of a multimedia communi-
cation network, and (3) a future-oriented design
that provides flexible system configuration and
high performance capable of sending high-defini-
tion TV signals. The system is expected to find
significant application of these features in (1)
central earth stations for VSAT data communica-
tion   networks,    (2) central earth stations for
satellite news gathering (SNG), and (3) satellite
communication entral earth stations for various
private networks.

has developed the BX-2 Complex Tie-Line System, a dealing
system that provides the world's fastest access, and will
initiate sales of the new system on April 1st.
     The BX-2 is provided with an abundance of functions to
meet the needs of the entire dealing market, including
short-term investment companies, banks and securities
companies, and can be used to construct a system that is
most suitable for the specific application, with system
sizes ranging from medium to large, thus giving the
impression of an order-made system. Maximum capacity of the
BX-2 is 4,000 circuits (2,000 circuits if touch screens are
used) and 512 operating stands.

     The price for a standard configuration, which consists
of 200 lines including leased line, station line and PBX
line and 50 operating stands, ranges from 80 to 150 million
yen (excluding consumption tax and installation cost).
     The major features of the BX-2 are (1) adoption of a
distributed control system, (2) the world's fastest access
for all-digital circuits and the fastest information
delivery speed, (3) adoption of touch screens to realize
smaller operating stands, and (4) an abundance of module
panels that can be flexibly assembled to provide the feel
of a custommade dealing board.
     Iwatsu expects to sell 50 systems and 2,000 operating
stands in the next year.

ATM IN THE PUBLIC NETWORK:
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR, WHO WILL DELIVER IT?

By Lawrence Gasman
Senior Contributing Editor

Just as the recent fuss over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) as
a transport technology for enterprise networking hubs was eclipsing
ATM's role in the public network, Sprint's announcement that it has
won a major government contract to supply ATM services has put
the subject of ATM in public networks back in the limelight.  Some
important questions are being raised:

"What is the relationship between ATM services and the carriers'
pre-broadband SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) and
frame relay services?"

"Who will be the leaders in the ATM market?"

"What is the relationship between private and public ATM?"

Answering the first of these questions is made more difficult by the
insistence, in most discussions of ATM, that ATM is one thing when
it really is two.  ATM is a switch/multiplexing technology that may
be deployed in the central office or on customer premises.  ATM is
also a future service provided by a carrier.  As a service, ATM
provides access to an ATM switch-ing/multiplexing fabric in much
the same way that ISDN provides access to an Nx64 Time-Division
Multiplexed (TDM) switching fabric.

As a switching/multiplexing technology there is no conflict between
ATM, on the one hand, and frame relay and SMDS, on the other.
On the contrary, ATM switches are the ideal switching technology
to underpin frame relay or SMDS.  StrataCom, the company that
pioneered frame relay switches, is well advanced in transitioning its
non-standard cell-based switches to ATM, for example.  But as a
service, ATM is a potential serious rival to SMDS and frame relay.

Even at this early stage of ATM development, this rivalry is
becoming apparent.  Sprint won its ATM service contract with the
Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in competition with AT&T and MCI, both of which
apparently planned to service the contract with SMDS or something
like it (see separate story).

And the overlap between ATM and earlier services has become
greater because of the recent specification by the ATM Forum
which includes a DS-3 (45 Mbps) interface to ATM.  Previously, the
only standard interfaces to ATM were the CCITT's OC-3 (155
Mbps) and OC-12 (620 Mbps) interfaces defined for the ATM
Layer of Broadband ISDN.

OC-3 and OC-12 are overkill for today's wide-area network
applications.  DS-3 is about right.  SMDS also works at rates up to
DS-3.  In fact, the ATM Forum's DS-3 interface and the SMDS
interface both borrow heavily from the work done for the IEEE's
802.6 Metropolitan Area Network.  Frame relay still operates at
rates of DS-1 and below, but BT North America (and perhaps other
carriers) may force frame relay up to DS-3.

DS-3 SMDS and "native" ATM services operating at DS-3 rates
have a lot in common.  But it remains unclear how well SMDS
would support applications involving real-time voice and/or real-
time video.  There probably would be no major problem with
running voice/video over SMDS, but SMDS is being marketed
primarily as a data-oriented LAN (local area network)
internetworking service, while ATM specifically was designed to
support virtually every kind of communications mode.  Many people
believe that multimedia communications--a combination of voice,
text, still-image, animation, and full-motion video--will be the "killer
application" for ATM.

Sprint is well positioned to exploit the multimedia-over-ATM
opportunity.  Not only will it be supplying the Energy Department
and NASA with ATM services, but it is also a major participant in
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's MAGIC test
bed.  Here Sprint will supply ATM backbone service for a
visualization application (visualization networking has many of the
same characteristics as multimedia).

Finally, Sprint is the market leader in the videoconferencing services
business.  And videoconferencing may well emerge as a vital
component of multimedia.

But the die is not yet cast.  MCI and AT&T have well-advanced
broadband plans, although ATM does not seem to be as central to
their plans as to Sprint's.  WilTel, on the other hand, has always
said that it wants to have an ATM backbone in place by 1993, and
WilTel's role may take on new significance if it forms a relationship
with British Telecom as expected.  Also, at the time of writing, the
Sprint DOE/NASA contract was not absolutely finalized.  So,
Sprint's ATM lead still could be lost.

The ATM-based public carrier switch market is wide open.  Of the
three major central office switch vendors--AT&T, Northern
Telecom, and Siemens Stromberg-Carlson--none has yet to
announce the availability of a full-scale ATM central office switch.
In fact, the nearest thing to an ATM central office switch these days
is Fujitsu's FETEX-150.

Fujitsu never has had a presence in the U.S. central office switch
market, but it has used its early adoption of ATM to leverage the
FETEX-150 into several important broadband trials--including U S
WEST's COMPASS trial, which some believe will help set the
pattern for future Bell company broadband switch purchases.  The
FETEX-150 is also in trials with BellSouth and NYNEX.  A couple
of months back, NYNEX installed a FETEX-150 in its R&D lab,
claiming that it had the "world's first hybrid/ATM fabric."

It seems that almost every telecommunications equipment and
computer company has plans for an ATM product of some kind.
There are lots of plans, but few products.  And, of course, most of
the products are aimed at private networks rather than the public
carriers' networks, which brings us to the final question raised at the
beginning of this article:  What will be the relationship between
ATM equipment in the public network and ATM elements in
private networks?

ATM began as a technology for public networks--the transport
technology for broadband ISDN.  Now, however, it is believed that
ATM will find its first commercial applications in multimedia LANs
and in private network hubs.  The truth is that ATM probably
simultaneously will start to appear in islands in all segments of the
network, with public data carriers accounting for a significant slice
of ATM activity.

But despite all the fuss about ATM and promises of ATM products
and services, the fact is that ATM in any form is still not quite here
as a widely available commercial reality.  That will not happen until
1993.

SPRINT WINS $50,000,000 CONTRACT TO UPGRADE
ENERGY, NASA RESEARCH NETWORKS TO ATM

The Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration have selected Sprint Corp. to provide broadband
communications services needed to upgrade three of their national
research data networks to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
technology.  Estimated to be worth more than $50,000,000 over the
next five years, the contract makes Sprint the first carrier to provide
wide-area ATM service, DoE said.

Slated for the upgrade are DoE's Energy Sciences Network (ESnet),
and NASA's AEROnet and Science Internet systems.  These
networks provide high-speed, nationwide, and international data
communications to support various open research and educational
programs in energy, aeronautics, space, and earth science.

ATM service will be provided to the ESnet on an "early availability"
basis, while it generally is "not expected to be widely commercially
available before 1994," Sprint said.  The activity is funded under the
federal High-Performance Computing and Communications
Program.  Working with Sprint on the contract is TRW of Redondo
Beach, Calif., which will provide new broadband access switches
developed by its Space Communications Division; Cisco Systems of
Menlo Park, Calif., a manufacturer of network routers; and Digital
Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass.

BELLCORE ISSUES ATM/BROADBAND ISDN
GENERIC REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTS FOR COMMENT

Public network deployment of Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM)/broadband integrated service digital network (BISDN)
capabilities came another step closer with Bell Communications
Research's issuance of three technical advisories.  It released
documents on "broadband switching system generic criteria" (TA-
NWT-001110); "broadband ISDN physical interface specifications"
(TA-NWT-001112); and "broadband ISDN transfer protocol generic
criteria" (TA-NWT-001113).

The first document describes the telecommunications switching
system capabilities required, including user and network interfaces,
internetworking, services supported, operations functions, usage
parameter control, and performance.  The second proposes the
generic requirements for the BISDN user-to-network interface and
the network-to-network interface.  And the third provides proposed
generic requirements on how information is carried through the
BISDN network.  It focuses on services provided by each layer of
the protocol, functions performed to provide these services, and
interactions between functions.

The advisories are being circulated for industry comment before
being finalized as Bellcore Technical References, and Bellcore
expects that work will continue into next year.  Steve Walters,
Bellcore's BISDN project manager, said that the advisories "are a
critical step in BISDN deployment in that they contain generic
requirements needed by suppliers so they can build initial BISDN
network equipment."

FRAME RELAY FORUM RATIFIES NETWORK-TO-
NETWORK INTERFACE; SPRINT's TAFFEL IS NEW HEAD OF FORUM

The Frame Relay Forum has ratified a network-to-network interface
(NNI) implementation agreement for permanent virtual circuit
(PVC)-based frame relay networks.  "The effect of this milestone
agreement will be to extend the geographic reach of frame relay
networking by permitting both public-to-public as well as private-to-
public network interconnections," said Alan Taffel, the forum's new
President and Chairman.  Mr. Taffel, Director-product marketing at
Sprint Corp., succeeds Thomas H. Jones, formerly of Netrix Corp.
Mr. Jones recently resigned his forum post when he left Netrix to
become Vice President-marketing for Microdyne Corp., which is not
a member of the forum.

The NNI agreement is based upon a similar user-to-network
interface (UNI) implementation pact approved by the forum earlier
this year.  "The NNI agreement, however, addresses new areas such
as bi-directional procedures for PVC management signaling and
congestion control," the forum noted.  The agreement now will be
forwarded to the Open Systems Interconnection Implementor's
Workshop (OIW), including the OIW's Asian and European arms,
for ratification.  It also will be submitted for inclusion in the
Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile, as was done
previously for the UNI agreement.  According to the Frame Relay
Forum, this approach "is likely to be followed by other industry
forums, such as the ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) Forum."

Meanwhile, the Frame Relay Forum's Technical Committee has
generated draft implementation agreements on multiprotocol
interconnection over frame relay and on switched virtual circuit
frame relay services.  Earlier, a service description for frame relay
multicast was developed.

The forum is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting the
acceptance and implementation of frame relay based on national
and international standards.


While the forum is not a standards-making body, its technical
committees provide liaison with the standards bodies.

The forum just established two new chapters--one based in Rennes,
France (for Europe) and one headquartered in New South Wales
(for Australia).  There are plans to form a chapter in Asia.

MFS PRESIDENT SEES FCC's EXPANDED
INTERCONNECTION DECISION
AS `ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCK' FOR DISMANTLING
LOCAL TELCO MONOPOLY

(At its open meeting Sept, 17, the FCC took several actions that will
hasten the end of the local exchange monopoly in the U.S.  The
centerpiece of its package of decisions was the adoption of rules
allowing telco competitors and users to physically collocate their
transmission equipment in telco central offices.  The FCC said that
interconnectors and local telcos would be free to negotiate "virtual"
collocation agreements as well.  Telcos were directed to file tariffs
outlining all terms of their special access interconnections, including
charges.  Interconnection for switched transport is being considered
in a separate FCC proceeding.

In an interview at TDR's offices the same week, the head of a
competitive access provider that had urged the FCC to look into the
matter discussed the competitive era emerging.)

While MFS Communications Co., Inc., President Royce J. Holland
did not expect a "perfect" FCC decision on expanded
interconnection with local telco facilities, he views the agency's
recent decision as an "essential building block" for dismantling the
"$90 billion local exchange monopoly."  Mr. Holland, who also is
President and Chief Executive Officer of MFS, Inc., described the
regulatory process as "analog," not "digital"; he explained that
changes in the system are "incremental rather than all at once."

He predicted a "five- to eight- or nine-year" period before the
outstanding major issues would be resolved and the breakup of the
local loop monopoly would occur.  He likened the natural monopoly
or franchise concept to the Berlin Wall, which was built to keep
people in as well as out.  "Modern telecommunications should not
look like the old East Germany," he said.

"We're getting a lot of inquiries today about customized network
solutions throughout metropolitan areas," Mr. Holland said.  "This is
primarily for data transmission, to link workstations and PCs with
mainframes, to link workstations together, for shooting images and
data back and forth across town.  In other words, we're talking
about replacing the automobile as a vehicle for transmission with a
high-speed link.  With interconnection, we can provide that one-stop
shopping to a particular business."


For example, he said, suppose there is a business with its
headquarters in downtown Chicago, a high-speed data center in the
O'Hare airport area, and three regional offices in Evanston, Joliet,
and St. Charles.  Today, MFS would be able to serve only the
headquarters and the data center with its fiber optic network.  But
with interconnection authority, MFS could add the three "remote"
sites.

In other words, the company would be able to interconnect these
sites with the Bell company in the serving wire center for each
location, lease DS1 channel termination circuits from the Bell
company, install its own routers on the customer's premises, and
allow the customer to access the mainframes and work stations
elsewhere, Mr. Holland said.  He promised that the company's MFS
Datanet, Inc., subsidiary soon would begin making announcements
regarding high-speed data projects.

Mr. Holland noted a "changing perception" in the industry, whereby
local telecommunications services "are being regarded as strategic
and tactical weapons for businesses to gain competitive advantages."
Several MFS customers, in fact, are employing "unique" image
processing and other high-speed data applications for services such
as Ethernet and Token-Ring channel extensions, he said.  But he
added that confidentiality agreements prohibit him from disclosing
more details.

He noted that MFS's goal is not to be the "second telephone
company."  Rather, the company's objective is to become the
"leading nationwide provider of voice, data, and video services to
businesses, government, and professional organizations," he said.
He did not see MFS's role as analogous to that of MCI
Telecommunications Corp. vis-a-vis AT&T.  He saw it more like
that of IBM Corp. and Electronic Data Systems in relation to the
industry.  "We're more on the trunk side of the PBX than the line
side," he said, adding that the role of the "second phone company" is
better played by the cable TV industry, which primarily serves
residences rather than businesses.

The authority to interconnect to local exchange carrier (LEC)
facilities means "significantly expanded competition for special
access" services and "LATA-wide ubiquity" in the 14 metropolitan
markets that MFS currently serves, Mr. Holland said.  He noted
that these "first-tier" cities include the nation's 10 largest special
access and private line markets.

But with interconnection authority, MFS could justify expanding its
facilities and even "start looking at second-tier cities" such as
Nashville, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix, Mr. Holland said.  "With
interconnection," he explained, "all of a sudden, you now have
LATA-wide ubiquity.  And now you can actually go out and address
the total market and phase in your network as you get market
share."

Without interconnection, however, only the largest markets will
enjoy the benefits of competition, he said.  "In fact, if you were
starting from scratch in the CAP (competitive access provider)
business today, you'd want to count the number of stock exchanges
in a city.  That probably is directly related to the volume of special
access circuits and local private lines--which is probably as good an
indicator (of market potential) as any," he explained.

Despite the emphasis on large metropolitan areas, MFS has not
divorced itself from what might be called "third-tier" markets served
by small independent telephone companies.

One of MFS's customers is the Minnesota Equal Access Network, a
group of independent telcos that is establishing a network that
"basically bypasses U S WEST," Mr. Holland said.  "What we do on
a city-wide scale, independents are doing on a statewide scale," he
added.

He said that MFS is involved in discussions with a number of
independents--"especially those near metropolitan areas that are
interested in using our services to get downtown."  He explained
that MFS already is providing a certain group of independents with
"diverse fiber routing from their territory" to a certain metro area.
But he said he could not disclose details because the parties
involved were not ready to make an announcement.  He believed
that CAPs and independents are "natural allies" because both have a
"difficult time" dealing with the Bell companies.

Pointing to a Connecticut Research study, Mr. Holland said that
1992 CAP revenues are estimated to be approximately $250,000,000.
MFS is "about half the industry; we're going to do $125,000,000 this
year," he said.  He added that MFS's investment totals $250,000,000-
-"again about half the industry."  The other half of the CAP industry
includes cable TV companies (approximately 40%) and small,
regional CAPs (5%-10%).  Titled "Alternate Local Transport:  A
Total Industry Report," the Connecticut Research study projects
that CAP revenues will reach $1.2 billion by 1995.  Contact Dick
Tomlinson at 203/659-0009.

Mr. Holland said he believes that MFS can maintain its share of the
CAP industry because it has the financial resources, can support
new product development, and has high standards for its own
network.  Following interconnection authority for CAPs, a relatively
rapid resolution of local dial-tone, switched access, interLATA toll,
and number portability issues is likely, he predicted.  By the end of
the decade, he predicted that all of the local exchange market would
be deregulated, competitive access would be a multibillion-dollar
industry, and CAPs would have a 35% share of the market.

FOCUS ON USERS
SURVEY SHOWS USE OF MULTIPLE LANs IS UP 30%,
BUT SPENDING FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS REMAINS
FLAT

While the installation of local area networks has increased
dramatically during the past year, overall spending on
telecommunications has been flat, a survey of nearly 800 North
American business and government telecom users has shown.  The
t
n726
fourth annual survey, conducted by Deloitte & Touche's
Telecommunications Group, revealed that more than 90% of the
respondents' organizations now have multiple LANs installed,
compared to 60% a year ago.

Communications managers cited "network management" as the most
important technical issue they face today.  Networks are expanding,
reflecting the consolidation of separate networks and the merger of
companies into single, large entities.  In addition, single
departments with corporate-wide telecom responsibilities are being
created.

The survey showed that telecom spending as a percentage of
revenue increased from 3% to 7%, depending upon the industry,
but that actual telecom expenditures generally remained constant,
increasing an average of 1.2% in 1991 across all industries.
Telecom spending in the government and financial services sectors
increased the most, 11%.  The manufacturing, services, and retail
industries decreased their telecom spending by an average of 9%.
Operating budgets for telecommunications averaged about 4.5 times
the capital budget across all industries, up from 4 times in 1991.
Salaries and personnel costs, the single largest budget component,
accounted for 27% of operating budgets.  Long distance, leased line,
and local access charges collectively accounted for 45%.  Twice as
many respondents--30%--reported having international responsibility
and coverage as in previous years.

Marco Bonilla, a partner in Deloitte & Touche's telecom practice,
said that "Despite the fact that 39% of the respondents indicated
that they had investigated enterprise-wide network management
products, not one, single enterprise network management system
currently exists among the responding companies."  According to the
survey, 88% of the respondents have one or more network products
and actively manage voice and/or data communications networks.
The most prominent wide-area network products in use are IBM
Netview, Racal-Milgo CMS, System Center Net/Master, and Codex.

A number of key network management issues were highlighted by
respondents.  These include:

The integration of networks and management products that
originally were not designed to work together;

An historical lack of internal company standards regarding
communications equipment;

An increased investment in telecommunications and the
requirement to protect that investment; and a general lack of well-
defined, open international standards on which to build network
management systems.

As for LAN design and operations, the average number of LANs
installed within the surveyed organizations was 48, each with 23
workstations on average.  Mr. Bonilla suggested that "This portends
an increase in the complexity of network services and expertise that
must be provided by the organizations responsible for LAN-related
technology deployment and operations, which may or may not be
the MIS/telecommunications department."

The use of LANs and LAN-based technology is prevalent within
most organizations, but "metrics for evaluating the performance,
availability, responsiveness, and data integrity of LAN-based systems
are informal at best and frequently don't exist at all," Deloitte &
Touche reported.  It said that a "lot of firefighting" has been the
result, and, consequently, companies "are not thinking about
tomorrow."  Yet increased reliance on communications means that
"the cost of service interruptions and degradation will rise as
productivity and revenues decline," Mr. Bonilla stated.  The
implication is that telecom planning and performance measures
must become a management priority in the near future.

While many new technologies have the potential to affect the
directions and strategies for LANs and LAN-based technologies,
survey respondents indicated that the following, in descending order,
will have the greatest impact:

Client/server applications (92%); Electronic image management
(91%); and Wireless LAN technology (73%).

Client/server applications are being used by 33% of the respondents,
though typically not for mission-critical applications yet.  Another
56% reported that they are evaluating the potential benefits of
client/server applications.  Respondents also indicated that such
applications currently make up less than 10% of their organization's
application portfolio (by number of applications).  Glenn James,
who developed the survey for Deloitte & Touche, said that
"Nevertheless, as the lack of internal expertise and mature products
is overcome, client/server applications will become a mainstream
design and delivery mechanism."

Deloitte & Touche said that "High-bandwidth metropolitan and
wide-area networks (greater than T-1) are not yet extensive in any
industry other than financial services (banking and brokerage
services) and education.  However, several industries and individual
companies report that they are investigating or planning such
networks within the next two years.  Products including frame relay,
FDDI, and SMDS are the most likely means of satisfying these
high-bandwidth requirements.

"Application development, particularly as it relates to the LAN and
workstation environment, and LAN-to-LAN communications will
force the implementation of these higher-bandwidth products and
services.  Projected rapid price decreases over the next few years for
some network services and communications hardware will allow
justification of projects that are currently not feasible or that can
only be marginally rationalized."  Contact Mr. Bonilla at Deloitte &
Touche, 285 Peachtree Center Ave., Suite 2000, Atlanta, Ga. 30303.

NETWORK NEWS
MCI TOUTS USE OF SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT
PROTOCOL FOR FRAME RELAY NETWORK MONITORING

MCI Communications Corp. says it is the first carrier to introduce a
frame relay management system based on a Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP).  MCI's Frame Relay Customer
Network Management (CNM) system collects and displays service
performance and alarm monitoring information on demand.  "With
CNM, customers obtain a variety of network information including
alarms on network equipment, permanent virtual circuits, and access
lines, as well as statistics on frame and byte counts, input and
output errors, and comparable information from MCI-provided
customer premise equipment," MCI said.

The information is provided through a CNM server over MCI's
frame relay network to the customer workstation using standard
SNMP and MCI's Enterprise-Defined Management Information
Base, which defines the information data base available to the
customer, MCI noted.

"Because the information is provided in a standard-compliant
format, customers' existing workstations can be used to process this
information and can be configured to support other network
management elements of their wide-area networks as well as
monitor LAN activity.  This eliminates the need for separate LAN
management systems," it added.

CNM became available Oct. 1 on a limited basis and is planned for
general commercial availability in the first quarter of 1993.

While MCI has not made final decisions on pricing, it noted plans
"to charge standard installation fees based on the level of
installation support required and recurring charges ranging from
approximately $300 to $2000 per month, depending upon the
workstation and network management package selected."  MCI
plans to enhance CNM capabilities for use with its future virtual
private data services, and to incorporate it or similar capabilities
into other MCI data network management products--such as
Integrated Network Management Service--over time, depending on
market demand.

AT&T PLANS TO OFFER INTEGRATED ACCESS
FOR PUBLIC NETWORK ISDN/PRIVATE NETWORK
SERVICES

AT&T has announced a new feature that will allow customers to
access both public switched ISDN (integrated services digital
network) and private network services on a single high-speed T-1
(1.544 megabits per second) facility.  With the new Primary Rate
Interface Static Integrated Network Access (PRI SINA) feature,
"smaller locations that could not justify the cost of separate access
facilities can be more innovative in their use of applications such as
local area network interconnection and videoconferencing," said
Richard Campbell, AT&T's ISDN product manager.

The cost efficiencies of PRI SINA can be enhanced when used with
Call-By-Call service selection, "an additional AT&T ISDN feature
that allows customers to select the switched services to be used on
each access channel on a call-by-call basis," AT&T said.  It also
noted that "Together with intelligent switching multiplexers, such as
the Teleos NetworkHub, PRI SINA can provide even further
efficiencies and cost savings.  The Teleos NetworkHub can allocate
private line overflow onto switched service lines on demand."

A trial of PRI SINA and the Teleos NetworkHub currently is being
conducted by 3M, Teleos Communications, Inc., and AT&T.  Begun
in May, the trial provides switched and private network connections
between three 3M locations in the U.S.  The Teleos NetworkHubs
aggregate traffic onto a single T-1 facility at each location and
allocate individual channels at each location to meet the location's
voice, data, and video needs.  The trial's applications combine
videoconferencing, local area network interconnection, voice
communications, and access to a private X.25 data network.

AT&T emphasized that "Instead of buying more private line
capacity for peak traffic overflow, a company like 3M can save
money by using PRI SINA and the NetworkHub to move peak data
traffic onto public switched network services as needed.  3M also is
able to consolidate several AT&T services onto one highly
manageable high-performance digital access facility."  The trial will
evaluate "operational readiness and key reliability measures" prior to
AT&T making PRI SINA widely available in September.  To use
PRI SINA, customers need an M-24 service function in the AT&T
central office, AT&T noted.  There is a monthly $150 charge for the
function.

NEBRASKA TELCOs, UNIVERSITY, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES COOPERATE ON FRAME RELAY NETWORK

The Nebraska Telephone Association (NTA) has begun phasing into
service a frame relay data network for the state.  Frame relay
centers already are in operation in Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island,
Norfolk, North Platte, Alliance, and O'Neill.  The Public Service
Commission helped coordinate the project, which required
cooperative efforts by the government, University of Nebraska, and
NTA's 40 local exchange carrier members.  NTA Chairman Norm
Osland said that "An up-to-date telecommunications network is
viewed as critical to the economic development of Nebraska.  We're
pleased that the state is working with the private sector to see that
Nebraska can continue to maintain its leadership position in the
area of telecommunications."

Expected to make early use of the system are the state's Library
Commission, the Department of Education, the University of
Nebraska Medical Center, and local libraries, schools, and hospitals.
Private-sector entities expected to use the service include financial
institutions and multi-location businesses.

TECHNOLOGY
TEST OF LOCAL EXCHANGE/INTEREXCHANGE NETWORK
INTEROPERABILITY FOR ISDN IS SUCCESSFUL

The first interstate call testing MCI Telecommunications Corp.'s
ISDN (integrated services digital network)-capable network and the
access capabilities of two phone companies was completed
successfully.  The test call was initiated from a New Jersey Bell
Telephone Co. switch in Holmdel, N.J., to New York Telephone
Co.'s West Street location in New York City over long distance lines
provided by MCI.

"The trial involved routing and signaling for both voice and data
calls using local switches made by two different manufacturers," Bell
Communications Research reported.  The call, which was part of a
four-phase testing program looking toward introduction of a
nationwide ISDN network this fall, marked the start of testing to
confirm the interoperability of local exchange and interexchange
networks for ISDN transmission and signaling.

Testing is scheduled to begin soon between the Holmdel switch and
BellSouth Telecommunications switches in Atlanta; AT&T's
interexchange network will be used.  The third phase of testing,
which will be ongoing until later this month, will involve calls
between switches in the 20 cities that will be part of the initial
national ISDN network.  In the final phase during October and
November, user-to-user applications will be tested.  Earlier, Bellcore
and manufacturers tested switches and various network components.

RAD NETWORK DEVICES GETS PATENT FOR
`SOURCE ROUTING TRANSPARENT' PROTOCOL

RAD Network Devices, Inc., has been granted a U.S. patent for the
technology that permits the "source routing transparent" (SRT)
algorithm.  SRT is an emerging bridge standard for both FDDI
(fiber distributed data interface) and Token-Ring LANs.  It
simultaneously supports user stations employing the "source routing"
and the "transparent routing" methods, allowing LANs in mixed
environments to communicate with each other regardless of their
bridging schemes.

RAD Network Devices, of Huntington Beach, Calif., explained that
"To network managers and their companies, this results in
tremendous cost savings by eliminating the need for multiple bridges
and separate lines to support the different LAN internetwork
traffic."  The SRT algorithm "allows both the transparent and
source-routing methods to exist within the media access control
(MAC) layer," it added.  "SRT handles both the existing MAC layer
bridging protocols by differentiating between these two methods on
a frame-by-frame basis, as the packet is routed."  The SRT concept
has been adopted by an Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers standards committee, which is in the process of approving
SRT as an addendum to the existing IEEE 802.1D local bridge
standard.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR, ADAPTIVE CORP.
REACH ATM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT

National Semiconductor has signed an ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode) technology development agreement with ADAPTIVE Corp,
a majority-owned subsidiary of Network Equipment Technologies,
Inc.  The pact makes National the first LAN semiconductor
company to endorse ATM technology, and the announcement marks
the first in a series of steps in National's strategy to focus on
multimedia computers and high-speed networks.  Under the
agreement, ADAPTIVE's ATM interface technology will be licensed
to form the basis of future chipsets from National.

Charles Carinalli, Chief Technical Officer and Executive VP of
National's Communications and Computing Group, said that "This
is just one of a number of revolutionary networking announcements
that you will see from National over the coming year that cover the
full spectrum of desktop platforms from PCs to workstations.  ATM
is the long-term strategic solution for seamless global networking.
We see it as a perfect complement to our multimedia enhancement
strategies for Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI" (fiber distributed
data interface).

The companies explained that "The appeal of ATM to the LAN
industry is based on the premise that today's data-only networks are
becoming congested and increasingly difficult to design, administer,
and manage.  ATM allows the construction of very high-
performance/capacity workgroups and backbones that will reduce
these problems and support emerging multimedia applications."

BELLCORE OFFERING TECHNICAL AUDITING
SERVICES DIRECTLY TO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS

Bell Communications Research has started offering technical
auditing services directly to suppliers of network and end-user
equipment for SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) and
frame relay PVC (permanent virtual circuit) services.  In the past,
Bellcore generally conducted technical analyses of a supplier's
products only at the request of its Bell company owners.

Michael Koblentz, Bellcore's Director-data communications
technical analysis, said that "The successful widespread deployment
of both frame relay and SMDS services--and their ultimate
usefulness to customers--depends heavily on multi-vendor
interoperability and equipment conformance to service
requirements.  This analysis, provided directly to suppliers, can help
speed this deployment, facilitating the ongoing migration from
private data networks to public data networks."

For both frame relay and Bellcore tests and SMDS, Bellcore tests
a vendor's product for compliance
For both frame relay and SMDS, Bellcore tests a vendor's product
for compliance with industry standards or Bellcore's generic
requirements.  The analysis covers traffic and protocol conformance
testing across the interface between a customer's equipment and the
telecom network.  Testing is accomplished using Bellcore-developed
systems that simulate multiple end users.  Bellcore pointed out that
although its technical audit "provides an objective analysis of a
product, it does not imply Bellcore's approval, certification,
recommendation, or endorsement."  More information is available
from Mr. Koblentz at 908/758-3086.

EQUIPMENT

Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Sonic Systems has introduced a high-speed
digital bridge that links remote Ethernet LANs via integrated
services digital network (ISDN) lines.  Sonic said that "Due to the
speed advantages inherent in ISDN lines, DigiLINK offers
significantly higher speed and performance when compared to
similarly priced analog modem bridges."  DigiLINK transmits data
at a speed of 128 kilobits per second; it has both the Ethernet
adapter and the ISDN terminal adapter built into a package the size
of a standard external modem.  No other hardware is required.  The
product is compatible with AT&T 5ESS and Northern Telecom
DMS-100 switches in the U.S. and with NTT INS-64 and
Superdigital switches in Japan.  It also is compatible with Signalling
System No. 7 and circuit-switched 56-kbps networks, allowing
domestic long distance and international connections between ISDN
environments.

WORLD WIDE WEB SITE CREATION MADE EASY

ElectriCiti Inc., a San Diego based Internet service provider,
has developed PowerStation, a combination of software and
services that allows individuals and businesses to easily
establish their own presence on the World Wide Web.
Christopher Alan, president of ElectriCiti, emphasized
"Previously, Internet 'home pages' were only available to
those with programming skills. The last technical barrier has
fallen. Those who can use a computer can create their own Web
site using PowerStation's point and click interface and
publish it on the Internet for one full year for just $495."

Alan believes that the company's new PowerStation package
represents a pivotal innovation in the way businesses and
individuals will participate in the growth of the Internet.
"Ben Franklin was fond of saying 'Freedom of the press
belongs to those who own one!"' said Alan. He is convinced
that easy access to the power of publishing on the World Wide
Web means added freedom of expression for individuals and
businesses of all sizes.

The Internet's growth is exploding because people are
realizing that it gives them an opportunity to have a voice on
the new electronic frontier.  College students are putting
their resumes on the Web, businesses are putting product
brochures and catalogs on the Web, community activists are
promoting their activities on the Web. Most other
communication tools such as television, radio, and print media
are very expensive to use. On the World Wide Web you can reach
millions of people, for just a few hundred dollars."

Alan predicts that any organization that currently
distributes information on paper will find the Web a
compelling alternative to the US mail. His chief argument is
one of economics "When you take a look at the cost of
delivering information on paper and compare that to the cost
of delivering information on-line you begin to realize that a
shift in the delivery method is inevitable. The only question
remaining is whether you are going to be on the leading edge
or the trailing edge of the trend."

The PowerStation program allows users to automatically
generate home pages, electronic business cards, resumes,
brochures, portfolio pages and interactive order forms. The
program also includes Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts
which enables users to receive orders from customers or to
program graphic images to act like "point and click" maps.

PowerStation includes five megabytes of Web site space on
ElectriCiti's network of high-speed Sun Sparcstations. The
site can be linked to thousands of other Web sites available
on the global Internet accessible by tens of millions of
Internet users.

ElectriCiti's art director Brad Pennock explains that in
addition to automatically generating the HTML programming
code used to create Web sites, PowerStation guides users
through the process of making their sites more visually
appealing. "The software assists users by providing a palette
of coordinated colors and a large library of professional
quality graphics. A sophisticated interactive multimedia
experience can be created by combining text, full-color
graphics, entry forms, sound and video."

PowerStation was created by an unusual team of software
engineers-most still in high school and college. Senior
software engineer Timothy Kimball is a sixteen year old
student at Gompers High School. Programmer Greg Hamerly worked
full time on the project between graduating from Poway High
School and entering Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Donna Whitlock
works full time at ElectriCiti as a systems analyst while on a
work practicum from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.

Christopher Alan, president of ElectriCiti, believes that
high school and college students offer an untapped potential
for developing high-tech progrwns and has given students key
roles since the company's beginning three years ago.
ElectriCiti evolved from a community service organization
comprised of students and programmers who had teamed up to
promote technical literacy among grade school and high school
students.

Alan named his young group of software developers "The
Watchmakers" in honor of a group of students at MIT who helped
build Project Athena, MIT's landmark distributed computing
experiment which established the first campus-wide Internet.
The Watchmakers at ElectriCiti, like their namesakes at MIT,
work as peers, not underlings. The team continues to play an
integral part in developing the company's cutting-edge
technology.

Alan is most proud of the fact that the PowerStation team
achieved the goal he set out for them-to give people the
power to create their own personal or business Web site with
just a few simple clicks of the mouse.

Members of the PowerStation development team are quick to
point out that unlike other Web publishing editors, the
ElectriCiti package gives users the ability to make their Web
sites available on the Internet. Other Internet providers
furnish the space but require users to create pages by writing
HTML code. In contrast, ElectriCiti's new PowerStation
achieves both goals in one easy to use, low priced package.
PowerStation is available for the Microsoft Windows and Apple
Macintosh and Power Macintosh computer platforms.

PowerStation may be previewed on the Internet by accessing
ElectriCiti's Web site at http:Hwww.electriciti.com.

ElectriCiti provides Internet services throughout the United
States. The company's software and service packages are avail-
able directly from ElectriCiti and from computer retail
stores. ElectriCiti maintains offices in San Diego, Orange
County, Los Angeles, and Santa Clara.

who do not want to manage Internet-specific servers in-house.

Customers Speak

While Digital customers may be operating at all levels of
involvement on the Internet, they consistently express high
regard in their assessment of Digital's breadth of Internet
service and support capabilities.

"We needed to get our Web product to market very quickly.
Digital was the one-stop shop where we could get Internet
application development, systems integration, outsourcing,
systems management, and top-notch technology. Digital not only

the Internet and a big support of the Internet community"
(Martin Dubetz, Director of Academic Computing and Networking,
Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri).

"I was intrigued with the Internet, but had no idea how to get
my business on-line. So I asked Digital to help me get
started. All of a sudden, I was getting orders from people
around the world, with daily orders from as far away as
Sydney, Australia. Orders can come in at any time of the day
or night, and I don't even have to be on-line." (Jean
Schroeder, Owner, Future Fantasy Bookstore, Palo Alto,

"HTMLSCRIPT" MAKES WEB SERVER
APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT EASIER

(San Diego, CA) Volant Corporation, of San Diego, CA,
has introduced an easy-to-use language for Web Servers called
htmlscript.  Completely browser independent, htmlscript allows
users to develop powerful interactive web pages in a server
safe environment.

Said Joe Austin, CEO Of Volant, "htmlscript solves the
fundamental problem of allowing Web Publishers to produce
sophisticated back-end programs without having to leave the
HTML environment. It's easy to use, powerful, and intuitive.
Site Administrators who have been hesitant to let their users
fully exploit the power of the Web can now let their users
develop applications without compromising system integrity."

The product is installed as a standard CGI application and
provides multiple administrative controls. Users can freely
mix HTML and htmlscript tags in their files. Once executed, it
achieves it's browser independence by operating as a
preprocessor so that it only outputs HTML code. The
htmlscript tags provide the capability to do logic,
calculations, and file input/output operations.

Tom Lettington, COO of ATMNet, a California-based Internet
provider said, "The installation of htmlscript was simple and
we really appreciate its administrative controls and extensive
logging capabilities.  Our users already know HTML, so there
was no training curve either."

Introductory pricing for a 500 user license is $99 and
includes one year of free updates. The software is available
for most UNIX and UNIX workalike systems. Special licensing,
including OEM and site licenses are available. Access to the
reference documentation is available at the
hftp:Hhtmiscript.volant.com/.

A Microsoft Windows NT version of the product is scheduled
for release later this year. The company is also developing a
version of htmlscript that will work with the new Java
software from Sun Microsystems.

Founded in 1992, Volant Corporation is dedicated to providing
services and software technology for the growing Internet
market. The company is privately held and is located at 2629
Ariane Drive, San Diego, CA 92117. For more information, call

DERWENT REACTION SERVICE INTRODUCED

Searching Derwent's reaction chemistry online by chemical
structures now possible. Derwent North America introduces its
state-of-the-art chemical reaction database for organic
chemists - the Derwent Reaction Service.  This unique Service
fulfills the information needs of chemists by offering
worldwide chemical reaction information of the highest
quality, in a variety of user-friendly formats.

"The great strength of Derwent's reaction collection is that
it adds only truly novel reactions - about 3,000 reactions
each year out of the millions reported" said Mike Harvey,
Senior Vice President of Intellectual Property for Derwent.
"This means that chemists will now have the ability to search
a comprehensive database and retrieve information on new,
reactions, rather than a series of examples of well-known
reactions" added Harvey.

The Derwent Reaction Service brings together key references
on novel synthetic methods from worldwide scientific and
patent literature. Derwent chemists have compiled this
information using strict selection criteria. This guarantees
that the database contains new reactions, synthetically-useful
modifications of known methods, and details of over 60,000
novel methods from the past twenty years. Each record
features an English-language abstract as well as reactions,
conditions, and structural formulas.

The Derwent Reaction Service is available in-house as a
monthly journal, online, or on CD-ROM. The entire backfile of
reactions found in the DRS is also available on CD-ROM. The
online file - DJSMonline - will be available to all STN users
after its launch at Online Information 1995 in December.

All Derwent Reaction Service products take their name from the
monthly journal (Derwent Journal of Synthetic Methods) and are
an extension and adaptation of Theilheimer's Synthetic
Methods of Organic Chemistry.

Information professionals, research chemists, lecturers and
students can choose the information product, or combination of
products, that meet their specific needs. They may prefer the
journal or CD-ROM for current awareness browsing, the online
database for structure searches, or the backfile CD-ROM for
compact archiving and information browsing.

For more than 40 years Derwent North America, a leading
international scientific and technical provider within Thomson
Business Information, has been providing mission-critical
information to chemists, scientists, companies and research
institutions throughout the world.

For more information, call (800)DERWENT or (800)336-5010.

Hearing Impaired Community, Wireless Industry Meet During
Summit to Find Solutions to Incompatibility, Interference
Problems

Wednesday kicked off a two day summit between members of the
wireless industry, the hearing impaired and hearing aid
manufacturers.  These diverse groups, at odds lately with each
other over issues of compatibility, met for two days at the
Hearing Aid Compatibility and Accessibility to Digital Wireless
Telecommunications Summit Meeting to discuss and explore avenues
for creating greater access to wireless telecommunications for
the hard of hearing population.
     Jay Kitchen, president of the Personal Communications
Industry Association (PCIA), opened the standing room only summit
by emphasizing that the wireless industry undertook the summit
not because it was mandated to do so, but because it was the
right thing to do.
     Kitchen encouraged attendees to set an example for
politicians and work quickly to build consensus and find
solutions to the problems of interference and incompatibility
between the wireless industry and the hearing impaired community.

     FCC Chairman Reed Hundt delivered the summit's opening
address.  He called the summit the "finest group of its kind that
has been assembled in the area of communications."  He added that
he was proud to see the communications industry come together
with representatives from the hearing impaired community to work
together in a spirit of cooperation.
     While new FCC Wireless Bureau Chief Michele Farquhar and
some of her staff were on hand for Hundt's opening remarks, they
could not stay and participate in the summit  because of the
government shutdown, Farquhar and her staff are authorized to
work on auctions only and could not stay to add their input and
represent the FCC in the meetings.
     Hundt called the summit the "right time and the right place
to pursue these issues," and he said the FCC will do what the
summit concludes it should do in order to make it possible and
practical for the hearing impaired to use wireless
telecommunications devices.  The FCC expects specific action
items to come out of the summit, he said, expressing his
confidence that the assembled group would find the right
solutions and that his agency would implement them so that all
Americans can be part of the Information Age. Time is of the
essence, Hundt said, as it is imperative that solutions to
incompatibility problems be found before the telecom industry
progresses any further.
     The companies that comprise the wireless industry face
incredible competitive pressures, Hundt told the audience, and it
is hard for those not directly involved with the industry to
sympathize with the pressure they are under.  He encouraged the
hearing impaired community to work with the wireless industry and
to be open to compromise so that a solution that is agreeable to
both sides can be worked out.
     The alternative, Hundt obliquely implied, would be having
the government step in and mandate solutions, which would likely
satisfy no one.  That point was reemphasized later in the day by
another speaker, Dr. Elizabeth Jacobson, deputy director of the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug
Administration.  Dr. Jacobson's office regulates medical devices,
such as hearing aids, and devices that emit radiation, such as
cellular telephones.  She said a non regulatory approach to
solving the problem of interference and incompatibility would be
faster and cheaper than getting the government involved and
encouraged both sides to work together to find their own
solution.

All Wireless Technologies Can Cause Interference, One Panelist
Said

     In the summit's first panel, George Schmitt, president of
Omnipoint Communications, said every wireless technology, whether
it is  CDMA, TDMA, DECT or GSM, can, in some circumstances, cause
problems with some hearing aids that are not well designed,
because all wireless technologies pulse, thus interfering with
hearing aids.  However, he said finding a solution to the problem
of interference is "absolutely do able," if mobile phone and
hearing aid manufacturers join forces with wireless operators and
help solve the problem.
     Schmitt responded to the charge that the wireless industry
has ignored the hard of hearing population, which some said
comprises 10 percent of the American population.  Because it is a
minority, Schmitt said that he does not believe any wireless
operator would be "dumb enough" to ignore the 10 percent of the
American population that is hard of hearing.
     Schmitt told the audience not to forget people with other
disabilities when discussing issues of accessibility to wireless
technology.  People with vision loss and physical handicaps have
as much of a right to use wireless technology as hard of hearing
people do, he said.  Schmitt added that the problem with
interference between wireless devices and hearing aids has been
exaggerated.  "The problem is not as severe as people make it out
to be," he said.

Representatives from the Hearing Impaired, Disabled Community
Discuss Incompatibility, Interference Issues At Summit

Two afternoon panels at Wednesday's Hearing Aid Compatibility and
Accessibility to Digital Wireless Telecommunications Summit
Meeting were made up of representatives from the hearing impaired
community who were on hand to educate the audience, especially
those from the wireless industry, about the problems they face
when trying to use wireless technology.
     On the first panel, "Understanding Hearing Loss,"  otologist
Dr. Stephen Epstein, presented information about the prevalence
and demographics of hearing loss in the United States.
     According to Dr. Epstein, 28 million Americans suffer from
some form of hearing loss and several million of them use a
hearing aid or some form of device that enables them to hear.
With the aging of the Baby Boomer generation, Epstein said his
figure of 28 million is likely to double in the coming 10 years.
Not only will the Boomers not go into old age peacefully, he said
they also won't go without their gadgets, further emphasizing the
need to make wireless devices hearing aid compatible.
     The following panel, "Access to Telecommunications,"
included a taped demonstration of what some hearing aid users
experience when they try to use wireless telephones.  Dr. Mead
Killion, president of Etymotic Research and an adjunct professor
of audiology at Northwestern University, conducted the
demonstration using a CDMA phone, a digital cellular phone and a
GSM based Sprint Spectrum phone.
     By placing a hearing aid that had a microphone implanted in
it in one of his ears, he was able to demonstrate to attendees
the kinds of interference that can occur with some wireless
phones.  In a few instances there was no interference, but in
several others the interference was loud enough to make it
impossible for Killion to hear the person he was calling.

Retro Fit Solutions Place a Poor Second to Designing Technology
to Be Compatible From the Beginning, Panelist Said

     Deborah Kaplan, vice president of the World Institute on
Disability, sat on the "Understanding Hearing Loss" panel.  She
is a member of the Clinton administration's Advisory Council on
the National Information Infrastructure and an advocate for
universal design, a theory and practice of designing everything
from buildings to telephones that emphasizes designing equipment
and services for the fullest range of human function  in other
words, creating things that can be used by the largest number of
people, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.  Curb
cuts, cuts made in sidewalk curbs, are an example of universal
design, as they allow people who are walking, confined to wheel
chairs, pushing strollers, pulling luggage and riding bicycles to
get onto and off a sidewalk without having to "jump" the curb.
     Kaplan lamented that the summit was focusing on retro fit
solutions to its problems instead of universal design.  Retro fit
solutions place a poor second to solutions that were designed and
implemented before a product ever leaves its testing phase, she
said.  Retro fit solutions do not tend to be affordable, elegant
or terribly useable, she said.  According to Kaplan, the problem
of incompatibility between wireless devices and hearing aids is
not just about technology, it is about the wireless industry's
failure to take its technology out of the laboratory and test it
on real human beings.
     When developing products for consumer consumption, companies
must ask themselves who will be using the product before, not
after, they have developed it, Kaplan said.  Failing to ask that
question may put companies in the position of having to ask
themselves questions about retro fitting:  How much will it cost
and who will pay for retro fit solutions?  Will it be comfortable
for users?  How difficult will it be to implement?
     Speaking to those members of the audience representing the
wireless industry, Kaplan advised them to put disabled people in
their focus groups and make them their beta testers, so as to
prevent problems like this in the future.   If wireless
telephones had been designed with hearing aid compatibility from
the beginning, the industry could have avoided many problems, she
said.

Informal Experiment Finds Some Hearing Aid Users Experience
Interference, Some Do Not

     Brenda Battat, deputy executive director for the educational
organization Self Help for Hard of Hearing People (SHHH),
discussed an  informal and unscientific test she had conducted
using a Sprint Spectrum phone.  She asked people that wore in
the ear hearing aids, behind the ear hearing aids, ear canal
devices and cochlear implants to use the phone and tell her what,
if any, interference they experienced.  She said all the behind
the ear device wearers who tested the phone experienced
interference.  Of the four in the ear device users she polled,
two experienced interference and two did not.  Those wearing in
the ear canal hearing devices also experienced interference, as
did the two she tested using cochlear implants.  Battat said she
also had her subjects try the phone using one of the external
phone devices, which are supposed to make wireless phones hearing
aid compatible.  While the device did work in that it enabled the
hearing aid users to hear the person on the other end of the
line, she said it did nothing to mitigate the interference they
experienced.
     Battat also refuted a claim made earlier in the day by Tom
Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association (CTIA) regarding the number of wireless phone
manufacturers that produce hearing aid compatible phones.
Wheeler stated that 25 wireless phone manufacturers are building
hearing aid compatible phones.  Battat said that only two
companies produce such phones, while the rest build in hearing
aid compatibility as a retro fit.m

Unitech was served with a class action lawsuit alleging the
company's publicly issued reports and statements contained
materially false and misleading information in violation of
federal securities laws.  The suit seeks unspecified compensatory
damages for shareholders who purchased Unitech stock between
March 16, 1995, and December 21, 1995  on December 20, the
company announced it expected to report a significant loss for
the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995, and that its previously
reported quarterly results for FY95 may have been materially
misstated.  Unitech's former CEO, John Londelius,  and COO,
Kenneth Lind, are named as individual defendants in the suit.

Mitsubishi released the first phone designed to work on American
Mobile Satellite's North American satellite system.  The
transportable phone is briefcase sized and is available through
authorized service dealers at a retail price of approximately
$3,300.  Usage rates start at $1.49 per minute.

MobileComm announced it will begin offering its retail pagers and
service offerings with a single frequency.  MobileComm pagers
will use the company's nationwide 900 MHz network.  This move
will benefit both retailers and customers by making it easier to
sell and use the pagers, the company said.  For example, multi
city retail chains will be able to reduce the number of units in
their warehouses while providing a wider range of services.
Additionally, MobileComm said users will benefit through enhanced
paging service without the hassle and expense of changing their
pager.

Bell Atlantic is getting into the site location service business.
The company's carrier services organization is joining with Bell
Atlantic Properties to help PCS licensees secure the real estate
they need for their antennas.  Bell Atlantic offers 2,000
possible locations for cell sites and will also assist PCS
operators in selecting and leasing sites from other sources.

United Airlines and GTE Airfone teamed to allow certain
passengers the ability to receive calls at their seat without
making any prior arrangements.  While it has been possible for
airline passengers to make calls from their seats for a couple of
years, this program allows United Airlines' Mileage Plus Premier
members to receive calls on United planes.  After being seated,
passengers remove the Airfone handset, slide their United Premier
card down the side of the handset and enter their seat number.
This activates the phone and lets GTE Airfone's system know where
the passenger is located.  When a call is placed to a passenger
on the plane, the handset will ring and the seat number of the
recipient will be displayed on the phone's screen.

AirTouch Communications acquired the assets of Message Center
Beepers, a privately held paging company with more than 345,000
subscribers, primarily in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
New York and Pennsylvania.  Financial terms of the deal were not
disclosed.

Geotek and Hughes Network Systems inked a deal calling for Hughes
to extend to Geotek a two year, approximately $25 million line of
credit for Geotek to acquire additional 900 MHz spectrum in the
United States.  The deal is a continuation of  a  strategic
partnership formed by th D AMPS/AMPS wireless system in the
Ukraine, in conjunction with the region's privately owned
operator, Digital Cellular Communication of Ukraine.  The service
will provide service in Donetsk, an industrial region with 5.5
million people.  Ericsson's system will combine fixed and mobile
wireless communication service with the capacity to cover between
6,000 and 7,000 subscribers.  Both the fixed and mobile services
will use the same base stations.  The order includes a mobile
switching center and several RBS 882 base stations.  The first
test call on the system is scheduled for March, and commercial
operation is set for launch in May.  Financial details of the
deal were not available.

Six companies from China and Singapore formed the Asia Pacific
Mobile Telecom Project to provide mobile phone services to any
location in the Asia Pacific region.  The project was founded by
four Chinese government organizations and two Singapore partners:
China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, China
Aerospace Corp., China Unicom Satellite Telecom, China
Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp, Singapore Telecom
and Singapore Technologies Telemedia.  With its cost estimated at
between US$500 million and US$800 million, it is envisioned that
the project will allow mobile phone users to make calls from
anywhere in the Asia Pacific region.  The project will begin
operation in 1998, providing "seamless" phone usage from Pakistan
to Japan and covering almost half the world's population, a
spokesman said.

times selected by the user.  The FLX has a suggested retail price
of $319.

The MicroTAC Lite II and MicroTAC Lite XL cellular phones from
Motorola may be used in conjunction with a HATIS (hearing aid
telephone interconnect system) device, which allows many hearing
impaired persons to use cellular phones.  The latest additions to
Motorola's family of cellular phones feature three dedicated, one
touch Turbo Dial keys for frequently dialed numbers; the
VibraCall alert option; data capabilities; internal rapid
charging; a headset jack for hands free operation with a headset;
and 99 alphanumeric memory locations to create a personal phone
directory.

The PCS 1900 series of omnidirectional and panel antennas from
Andrew Corp. are designed to decrease interference, decrease call
dropping and allow for easy upgrading.  They have a broadband
frequency range of 1850 MHz to 1990 MHz and are suited for
transmit or receive applications in networks designed for
omnidirectional and 60/65 horizontal beamwidth sector coverage.
They're also available for other frequencies and other
beamwidths.

The antenna equipped, AllPoints wireless PC card from Megahertz
fits into a type II PC card slot, operates approximately 30 hours

C-BLOCK AUCTION TOTAL PASSES $1.2 BILLION IN FOUR ROUNDS; BIDDING TO
RESUME JAN. 5

         Bidders in the C-block auction rocketed the net bid total to
$1.21 billion in the first four rounds before bidding closed Dec. 21
for the holidays.  The bidding competition at this early stage has
been fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13
rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the
$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses will resume
Jan. 5.
         As predicted by a number of industry insiders (PCS WEEK, Dec. 13,
pp. 1-3), the top markets have been the scene of the most furious
activity.  For example, Washington, D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed a
first round high bid of $11.3 million for the Chicago basic trading
area (BTA), only to have the lead taken by GWI PCS Inc. in round two
for $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. then upped the ante to $61.4 million
in round three.  Round four saw DCR take another shot at the lucrative
Chicago license with a bid of $70.3 million, or $8.59 per potential
subscriber in the market.  Several other markets, such as Miami and
New York, have seen similar activity.
         High bids for round four included $203 million for New York by
PCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million for
Philadelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc., headed by
former Qualcomm Inc. executive Allen Salmasi; $48.75 million for San
Francisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license by PCS
2000.

  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction

         In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchers
and participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. 
"It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are so
many changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst at Malarkey-
Taylor Associates/Economic and Management Consultants International
Inc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at the end of [the
auction, the environment] looks different than when it started."
Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst for
Washington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was not
reading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I think
there's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lot
greater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent that
companies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auction
environment and that there are many bidders that are not quite as
sophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."
Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top markets may
cause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. 
Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined not
to come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,
thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some of
these companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said. 

  ...What Is PCS 2000?

Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has been the
aggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-based
partnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry ever
since it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of round
four, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442
million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000
had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of the
Eastern United States.  
PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partners developed
and managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and 25 percent
owner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that was incorporated
for [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four years ago," said
Javier Lamoso, company president.
According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limited
partnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investment
companies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[The
investors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS
2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners owns
more than 3 percent of the company.
Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he did not
want to signal the partnership's true motives to other players.  He
explained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS
2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets it
wants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "If
I tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,
I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCC
has interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want to
avoid any hint of implied collusion."

THE LONG, STRANGE TRIP OF THE C-BLOCK AUCTION

    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 gave the FCC
authority to conduct auctions for PCS licenses and directed the
commission to ensure that "designated entities" (DEs)--small
businesses, women- and minority-owned enterprises, and rural telephone
companies--could participate in the bidding.  The FCC subsequently
allocated 120 MHz of spectrum in six licensing blocks for broadband
PCS.  The so-called entrepreneurs' block or, simply, the C-block--493
30-MHz basic trading area (BTA) licenses--was reserved for DEs.
During the past year, however, the courts--in taking a new tack on
affirmative action--threw a wrench into government's efforts to allow
small players to compete with "deep pockets" in the broadband PCS
auction arena.  What follows is the long, strange trip of the C-block
auction that we documented
this past year in PCS WEEK.  (The dates below refer to the issue dates
of this newsletter.)

  ...TEC v. FCC

    Jan. 5:  The FCC announced that the C-block auction would begin
April 17, or 30 days after the close of the A/B-block auction,
whichever was later. 
Short form applications were due Feb. 28.
    Feb. 22:  Telephone Electronics Corp., a rural telephone holding
company, asked the D.C. Circuit to bar the commission from setting a
short-form filing deadline for the C-block auction.  TEC challenged
the $125 million cap on annual revenues for C-block applicants as well
as the race- and gender-based preferences for DEs.  In short, TEC
wanted the FCC to apply the revenue cap to its operating companies
instead of itself so that it would be eligible 
to bid.  Arguably, TEC's affirmative action argument was an attempt to
leverage its case.
    March 22:  The D.C. Circuit granted TEC's stay request and set oral
argument for Sept. 28.
    April 26:  TEC dropped the case after forging a deal with PCS
PrimeCo L.P. to partition the New Orleans/Baton Rouge major trading
area (MTA).

  ...Adarand v. Pena

    June 14:  The Supreme Court, in a narrow 5-4 decision, threw a
wrench
 into federal affirmative action programs in Adarand v. Pena.  The
court ruled that race- and gender-based preferences had to be
"narrowly tailored" to
serve a "compelling government interest."  Adarand was remanded to the
Tenth Circuit.
    June 21:  The FCC postponed the C-block filing deadline but
insisted that the auction would begin on time--Aug. 2.
    June 28:  The FCC granted the A/B-block licenses and adopted a
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate race- and
gender-based preferences for C-block applicants.

  ...Omnipoint v. FCC

    July 26:  In its Sixth Report and Order, the FCC modified the C-
block 
rules to eliminate women and minority preferences, and to expand the
"49 percent equity exception" to all eligible applicants.  This
exception allowed investors, including large companies, to hold 49.9
percent ownership stakes in DEs.  Pioneer's preference winner
Omnipoint Corp., owner of the A-block license for the New York MTA,
objected.
    Aug. 2:  The D.C. Circuit granted Omnipoint's emergency stay
request.  Omnipoint had argued that the expansion of the 49 percent
equity exception 
to all C-block applicants did not allow enough time for "non-women/mi-
nority" 
entities to take advantage of it.  The constitutional argument was
that the FCC's decision violated the Fifth Amendment's equal
protection clause.  Omnipoint also argued that the FCC violated the
Administrative Procedure Act by not allowing appropriate time for
public comment.
    Aug. 16:  The FCC postponed the C-block auction indefinitely as the
D.C. Circuit set Sept. 28 as the date for oral argument on the
Omnipoint case.
    Sept. 20:  The House Commerce Committee passed a measure endorsing
the FCC's C-block rules and requiring the agency to begin the auction
by Dec. 4.
        Oct. 4:  Following oral argument, the D.C. Circuit lifted its
stay.  
In a 2-1 decision, the court essentially decided that Omnipoint, an A-
block license holder, would not be harmed by expansion of the 49
percent exception in the C-block rules.  Almost immediately, the FCC
set Dec. 11 as the starting date for the auction.

  ...Cincinnati Bell v. FCC

    Oct. 25:  Radiofone Inc. asked the Sixth Circuit to stay the
auction 
in a long-pending case regarding the FCC's cellular/PCS cross-
ownership rules.  Brought by Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. [CSN],
BellSouth Corp. [BLS] and Radiofone, the consolidated cases attacked
the commission's rules for cellular eligibility, attribution, and
structural separation.  The Sixth Circuit 
granted the stay until it ruled on the issues.  Under the FCC's 
eligibility rules, Radiofone was prohibited from bidding on PCS
licenses in three Louisiana BTAs because of its cellular holdings in
the same areas.
    Nov. 1:  At the request of the FCC, Supreme Court Justice John Paul
Stevens vacated the stay imposed by the Sixth Circuit.  And the full
Supreme Court rejected Radiofone's emergency petition to overturn
Stevens.  Thus, the FCC was able to proceed with the Dec. 11 starting
date for the auction.  The FCC had argued that Radiofone could bid on
the Louisiana BTAs so long as it later complied with any rules that
the commission adopted.
    Nov. 15:  The Sixth Circuit remanded the Cincinnati Bell case, with
instructions for the FCC to conduct further proceedings.  The
commission decided to proceed with the Dec. 11 auction date.
    Nov. 22:  The shutdown of the federal government over the budget
crisis prompted the FCC to reschedule the auction starting date for
Dec. 18.  Meanwhile, Radiofone asked the Sixth Circuit to clarify that
its remand order meant that the FCC had to postpone the auction until
the agency completed a rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-ownership
issues.  Radiofone argued that if it bid on the Louisiana BTAs, there
was no guarantee that it would not be subject to future penalties or
forfeitures. 
    Dec. 6:  The Sixth Circuit issued a mandate, stating simply that it
had remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings.  The court
did not address Radiofone's request or even mention the auction.  The
FCC determined that it could proceed with the Dec. 18 starting date.
    Dec. 13:  The FCC inadvertently sent proprietary financial
information from three companies, including Radiofone, to some C-block
applicants.  Separately, Radiofone again asked the FCC to stay the
auction and open an expedited rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-
ownership rules.  In addition, Radiofone filed a supplemental
memorandum with the Sixth Circuit, arguing that the court had the
power to enforce its mandate via contempt, mandamus or other
appropriate orders or writs.
    Dec. 20:  The C-block auction began despite the second shutdown of
the federal government.

INDUSTRY CANADA GRANTS FOUR PCS LICENSES, HOLDS BACK TWO

     Four Canadian PCS hopefuls received their Christmas presents a
week early when Industry Canada granted them licenses on Dec. 18 (PCS
WEEK, Dec. 20, 1995, p. 1).  The Canadian regulatory agency handed two
30 MHz licenses to specialized mobile radio (SMR) operator Clearnet
Communications Inc. and MicroCell 1-2-1 Inc.  The two 10 MHz licenses
went to cellular operator Rogers Cantel Mobile Inc. and Mobility
Canada--a nationwide alliance of local exchange carriers' cellular
subsidiaries.
    The four winners beat 15 other candidates for the licenses
ostensibly because they came closest to meeting Industry Canada's
policy objectives for PCS, which included the stimulation of
additional choices in mobile services similar to cellular and the
support of new technologies; the provision of new and innovative
services at 2 GHz, rather than mere provision of upbanded cellular
services; nationwide and worldwide roaming for Canadian citizens; non-
discriminatory access to the networks in order to allow third parties
to resell services; and the promotion of jobs and investment in
Canada.

  ...MicroCell Was Heavy Favorite, Insiders Say

    Although many in the Canadian PCS industry assumed that the 10 MHz
licenses would go to Cantel and Mobility Canada, the 30 MHz licenses
were harder to call.  According to a number of sources that spoke to
us before Industry Canada's announcement, MicroCell was the heavy
favorite for one of the licenses.
    In a news release following the licensing announcement, MicroCell
said that the government endorsed its open-network concept, under
which it will allow any company interested in reselling PCS to access
its system.  "We will allow access to our network to all companies and
entrepreneurs who want to market PCS," said Andre Tremblay, MicroCell
president and CEO.
    In addition, MicroCell promised to create a $90 million (Canadian)
research and development fund "aimed at backing the projects of
entrepreneurs who could not otherwise participate in PCS development. 
"We are prepared to finance innovative projects," explained Tremblay. 
"Those who have good ideas for new PCS applications are invited to
knock at our door."
    MicroCell has chosen the global system for mobile communications-
base PCS-1900 technology for its network and has supply agreements
with L.M. Ericsson AB and Northern Telecom Ltd..

  ...Clearnet Sees PCS Complementing ESMR

    The other 30 MHz winner, Clearnet, believes that it edged out the
other candidates based on its preparation for PCS buildout as well as
its experience with SMR.
    Over the past year, the company has raised more than $250 million
in capital for the construction of both its PCS and enhanced SMR
(ESMR) networks. 
    "We have had an objective to be the third major wireless service
provider [in Canada] since the company announced [Motorola's equity
stake in Clearnet] in February 1994," said George Cope, Clearnet
president and CEO, during a press conference conducted the day after
Industry Canada granted the licenses.  "I think we've now gone a long
way to enhance our position there."
    Clearnet also views PCS as the consumer complement to its ESMR
business services.  The company is in the process of completing the
first phase of its ESMR system buildout that will cover a region from
Quebec City to Windsor. Clearnet expects to begin commercial service
in mid-1996.
    "We have our business communications network--our ESMR network--
which is focused ... particularly on enhanced services all in one
handset," said Cope.  
"We view PCS as complementing [ESMR] as a product that will be able to
focus on the mass consumer market."
    Clearnet also intends to save a great deal on its PCS construction
costs by combining PCS with its ESMR system wherever possible.  These
savings will be passed on to the consumer, Cope said.  "We believe
that we also will be the lowest-cost PCS provider of the [two 30 MHz
licensees]," he added.
    The Pickering, Ontario-based company built out all of its ESMR
sites with the capability to carry PCS equipment as well, Cope
explained.  "A significant part of the total cost in designing a
wireless system are the soft costs of the sites--we won't have to
incur those costs a second time," he said.
    In addition, Cope said that Clearnet intends to share some of the
leased lines with both services.  Billing services for PCS will come
from the same company that Clearnet is using for ESMR, he said. 

  ...What About the Other Two Licenses?

    In its news release on PCS licensing, Industry Canada did not
comment on the fate of the remaining 30 MHz and 10 MHz licenses,
leaving many of those companies that did not receive licenses
wondering if there still was a chance to get into the market in the
next few years.  Industry Canada retained the right to hold back
licenses if it believed that there were not enough qualified
candidates, or if the agency determined that the Canadian market could
not sustain six PCS players.
    According to Kirk Hamilton, vice president of corporate and
government affairs for paging operator and PCS applicant TeleZone
Corp., Industry Canada has not given his company any indication of
what will happen to the licenses.  "They basically issued the licenses
and went off on holiday," he said.  "We hope to get some answers in
the new year."
    As for the future, Hamilton said that TeleZone will be looking for
other wireless opportunities as they come up.  But in the near term,
"our primary objective is to get access to the license that's still
unawarded at this time."

T1 DEVELOPS GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS PCS SECURITY

    The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions' Committee
T1-Telecommunications recently completed guidelines to address user
privacy and other security issues involving PCS.  Among other things,
the guidelines call for five common security requirements, including
user authentication, the ability to conceal a user's location to
prevent eavesdropping, bearer and signalling channel privacy for all
wireless terminals, user data stored in "smart cards," and the
exchange of security information among different PCS networks.  (Bob

INTERCEL PREPARES TO LAUNCH STOCK, NOTE OFFERINGS TO FINANCE PCS
BUILDOUT

     West Point, Ga.-based InterCel Inc. anticipates spending $110
million this year to build out Powertel PCS Partners L.P.'s PCS
markets, followed by an additional commitment of $150 million in 1997.
    In its latest annual report, the company disclosed that it plans to
make concurrent public offerings of stock and notes during the first
quarter of 1996.
    Approximate amounts raised from these offerings will be $115.5
million and $150 million, respectively.  Cash interest on the notes
will not be payable before 2001.  InterCel also is negotiating a $20
million revolving credit facility.

  ...Offerings Coincide With InterCel's Buyout of Powertel

    The offerings are being undertaken in conjunction with the cellular
operator's plans to acquire Powertel, a privately held consortium in
which InterCel already is a major participant (PCS WEEK, June 28,
1995, p. 7).
    The three licenses that Powertel won in the A/B-block auction cover
parts of nine Southeastern states with 9 million potential subscribers
or "pops."  After the initial phase of its buildout, Powertel will
serve 55 percent of the pops in its major trading areas, InterCel
said.
    InterCel chose global system for mobile communications-based PCS-
1900 as its technology standard last August (PCS WEEK, Aug. 30, 1995,
p. 7), but has yet to announce equipment contracts.

  ...Equipment Vendor Negotiations Continue 

    At our deadline, the company was continuing negotiations with
equipment supplier candidates regarding vendor financing.  "The
company currently believes that vendor financing may provide a
significant amount of the capital required for its PCS system,"
InterCel's annual report said.
    While noting that its cellular operations have achieved "positive
operating income," InterCel warned that management "expects to incur
significant operating losses beginning in 1996 as it develops and
constructs the PCS network and builds the PCS customer base."

'NET LOOMS OVER $10B FRAME RELAY MARKET

The Internet is making a move to de-throne frame relay and
private networks as the premiere venues for data communications.
But fear not.  All is not lost yet for frame relay.  Unresolved
security and efficiency issues are keeping the Internet protocol
(IP) networks from competing directly with private networks.  So
by responding rapidly to customer dynamics and keeping an eye on
quality, there still is time for the long-distance carriers to
score some cash in this $10 billion market.

"The Internet would be more of a complement or an augmentation
to frame relay," Carolyn Tommie, a product manager with AT&T's
Interspan frame relay service, told The Report On AT&T.

Industry players see no signs of the frame relay business
slowing down.  The industry saw triple-digit growth last year
and is expected to grow 100 percent next year.

"There has been an absolute explosion in this business as
businesses reorganize and applications are pushed out from the
desktop to the local area network [LAN]," Bart Westberg,
director of advanced data services at Sprint, told RATT.

One of the things that makes frame relay so attractive to data
customers, and thus such a hot business, is the cost/performance
ratio.  Since with frame relay, data travels in short bursts
over the network as opposed to in a steady stream, the customer
pays only for the time he uses the network.  Westberg told RATT
that especially for "many-to-many connectivity," the price
performance of the service is a big selling point.

But a wolf is at the door.  A study by Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., reports the Internet's cost advantage could be
just the arrow that pierces AT&T's heel in frame relay.  The
study says the Internet's cost advantage and flexibility will
leave private networks without any advantage by 2000.

However, Sprint's Westberg is confident that cost isn't the only
issue customers consider.  Although frame relay is cost-
effective, customers value quality of service above price when
choosing a carrier, he said.

"You've got to focus on the performance of the service,
technical service and network reliability.  You are dealing with
informed buyers, technical buyers," Westberg told RATT.

AT&T's Tommie agrees and adds that disaster recovery is an
advantage that frame relay has over the Internet.

"As customers switch mission-critical data, the carrier must be
able to back the service up in a number of ways.  You have to
give the customers more than one precautionary option," she told
RATT.  These options don't currently exist on the Internet, she
added.

Furthermore, Tom Pincince, an analyst with Forrester Research,
said Internet security is simply a red herring, and that public
networks can be just as secure as private networks.

William Callahan, a senior manager of broadband data marketing
at MCI, told RATT Internet security issues are on the verge of
being resolved.  He predicted that with the continuation of
firewall activity, the Internet will be as secure as frame relay
networks by the end of next year.

"But right now, [security] is why many businesses don't feel
comfortable with the Internet.  Thye are more comfortable with
frame relay," Callahan said.

Secure, yes, but perhaps not yet as efficient.  And that
efficiency problem could keep the IP networks at bay while the
long-distance carriers plot their next move, Pincince told RATT.

"Business users must be assured that mail sent is mail received
and that the multibillion dollar funds transfer does not get
pushed aside by the teenager downloading sports scores from
ESPN's Web site," he said.

That next move for interexchange carriers, Pincince advised,
should be to offer frame relay and Internet access in unison,
and perhaps eventually to wean customers off of frame relay.  At
least for the next few years, businesses should use both private
and public networks for data communications.

That challenge opens the door for a cohesive strategy of frame
relay and IP offerings.  Companies can send the bulk of their
data over the IP network and use the private, frame relay
network for sensitive information.

"Afterall, people use both the Postal Service and Federal
Express," Pincince told RATT.

AT&T now offers an Internet-connectivity option with Interspan
service.  It also provides its customers access to AT&T
WorldNet, which is a more comprehensive Internet offering than
that offered with Interspan.  Tommie said including Internet
access in conjunction with frame relay is vital because it
creates synergy between the two protocols.

"The Internet also has bursty use.  Someone may use the Internet
to pull down a large file.  Then another person in the company
may use it later for e-mail, but there never is a steady stream
of Internet use for the same function," Tommie said.

Sprint also is tying Internet backbone into its frame relay
offering.

"The underlying technology of the Internet is PCIC.  You have to
have a network to access the Internet.  ATM could be that
backbone [and we would try to provide it.]  It all depends on
how you position your service to meet your customers' demands.
It is not really a direct cannibalization of your business,"
Westberg told RATT.

Perhaps the company best suited for the evolution of frame
relay, and to challenge AT&T in data, is MCI, according to
Forrester's Pincince.  He said MCI has agility and a good
network backbone, and is not bogged down by a huge customer
base.  As a result, MCI will be able to get all of its customer
up to speed on new services faster than big fat AT&T, Pincince
said.

MCI's Callahan said that company has packaged Internet gateway
services together with frame relay since April.

"That gives our customers the ability to go back and forth
between the two. The two can peacefully co-exist," Callahan told
RATT.

Still, even as the Internet threatens frame relay today,
tomorrow could be a very different story and the two could still
play very well together.

"What will be the Internet of five years from now?  Five years
from now, corporations may rely on the Internet more for e-mail
than anything else," Mike Grubb, group manager of data services
at Sprint told RATT.  "And new applications and customer
requirements will drive frame relay service.  One type of
service is more suitable to the Internet and others to frame
relay."

Another way the carriers can slow the industry's progression is
to expand their customer base.  The market for frame relay
services doesn't have to end with Fortune 500 companies.
Although Sprint's main marketing thrust is aimed at mid- to
upper-tier companies, smaller companies also can be an
attractive customer.

"Anytime you've got multiple sites that you need to connect,
frame relay is a viable alternative.  Smaller companies are
getting into connectivity and pulling [Sprint's] focus down
somewhat," Westberg told RATT.

AT&T's Tommie said that company's customer breadth also is
across the board. Interspan has customers with as few as two
ports and as many as 1,000.

"Don't assume that [frame relay] should be targeted at large
companies only," Tommie said.

But carriers have to keep their eye on the ball to keep this
customer base happy than the average voice customer, Sprint's
Grubb told RATT.

"Voice technology is understood [by the customer] and not
evolving that much.  But data technology is a fast moving target
with ATM and ISDN and other technologies coming along.  The
demand for the technology is growing at least as fast as the
technology," Grubb said.

POOR BUYOUT RESPONSE WON'T HURT AT&T'S STRATEGY, ANALYSTS SAY

At first glance, the response to AT&T's management-buyout offer
seems weak - only 2,600 of the estimated 78,000 managers have
accepted to date.  But shed no tears for AT&T.  Analysts say the
company still will look good when it becomes a pure service
organization and begins to plot its invasion of the Bell
companies' local territory.

"Things are going as planned.  There are no surprises here.
AT&T likes to do things in a way that doesn't disrupt the system
that much," Brian Adamik, an analyst with the Yankee Group in
Boston, told The Report On AT&T.

Adamik said AT&T still will need to downsize in order to
transform itself into a purely service organization, but he is
unsure how deep the cutbacks will go.

He suggested that perhaps instead of layoffs AT&T will undergo a
redeployment of management from its headquarters out "into the
field," especially in light of its recent announcement to
aggressively pursue local markets.

"[AT&T will have to] de-centralize the business and put the
decisions out in the field.  Especially in product development,"
Adamik said.

An AT&T spokesman told RATT the company originally projected
about 4 percent of employees would take the offering.  The
number of people who had accepted by press time was just about
on target for AT&T, the spokesman said.

"It's not as attractive an offer as some would have liked,"
Yankee Group analyst Rob Rich told RATT.  Rich said he expects
the number to increase slightly before the end of the month.

The buyout will not eliminate the need for layoffs, however.
AT&T spokesman Burke Stinson told RATT it was meant only to ease
the company into telling some managers, beginning this month,
that they no longer have an assignment.

Rich said AT&T wasn't wiping as many costs off the books as it
would like, and that factor will cost the company some money.
But by the time the new company starts, the balance sheets
should look good so AT&T should be able to get low-interest
financing as a result, he said.

The deadline for accepting the buyout package was Friday; AT&T
should have the final numbers Tuesday.

COMMISSION GIVES GO AHEAD TO $4 BILLION INVESTMENT IN SPRINT

After much ado, Sprint finally got the nod from the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for its 20 percent sale to
France Telecom (FT) and Deutsche Telekom (DT).   Analysts say
this green light finally will put Sprint on equal footing with
AT&T and MCI on an international playing field - a field where
it currently lacks a presence.

"Sprint has been the weak sister among the big three [as far as
the international markets].  It had less facilities and
operations than AT&T and MCI," David Yedwab, an analyst with
Parsippany, N.J.-based consultancy Eastern Management told The
Report On AT&T last week.

Yedwab said MCI's partnership with British Telecom gave it a
strong international presence and AT&T's various partnerships
around the globe position it well on an international basis
also.  Sprint had been lacking such a strategic position, he
said, but not any more.

"This will put Sprint directly in the contest," Yedwab added.

The next step for Sprint and MCI is to see which can establish a
Pacific Rim presence to rival AT&T's, Yedwab said.

But let's not forget about the $4 billion plus change Sprint
stands to receive as part of this deal.  Yedwab said that cash
will go a long way toward Sprint's PCS investment - perhaps
giving the company a big boost over AT&T in the personal
communications field.  It also will help Sprint's investment in
a broadband network, an area in which Yedwab said Sprint is
falling behind AT&T and MCI.

Although the French and German telecom markets failed the FCC's
new test of market openness, the commission approved the $4.2
billion investment.

The FCC said that, in this case, it would give greater weight to
other factors, particularly how the cash infusion would enhance
the number-three long distance company's competitive position in
the United States.  Sprint has made major investments in the
States in personal communications service (PCS), a service seen
as a strong competitor to cellular.

The other factor is that French and German leaders have
committed to the FCC in writing that they will open their
telecom markets to competition in 1998.  If they fail to do so,
the FCC stands ready to revoke its approval of the deal, several
commissioners warned.

But the FCC also imposed several caveats, including banning
Sprint from increasing its capacity on its routes between the
United States and France and Germany.  That restriction is one
of several that exceed those imposed by a consent decree Sprint
has signed with the Department of Justice (DoJ).  It will go
away when switched voice resale and an alternative telecom
infrastructure are available in France and Germany.

A Sprint spokesman told The Report On AT&T it would have to
review the language in the FCC order with its partners before
commenting on the conditions.  Unfortunately, the recent
government shutdown has stalled the release of the language, and
the spokesman didn't expect to see anything from the FCC until
after the New Year.

The deal still must be cleared by the European Community as
well.

AN INSIDERS LOOK: NETWORKMCI SEEKS TO BROADEN HORIZON'S PAST
LONG-DISTANCE

This special report - the first in a new Report On AT&T series
of insider looks at key MCI operations - gives you the valuable
strategic information on the telecom company's plans in such
areas as network services, long-distance, electronic commerce
and wireless strategies.  In future issues of RATT, you'll get
these in-depth reports on other MCI operations as well as
reports on the goings-on at AT&T and Sprint.  If you've got an
area of particular interest, please give Executive Editor Kim

NetworkMCI Services: 1994-1995

MCI's strategic centerpiece, its ubiquitous networkMCI, seeks to
define the continuing evolution of MCI from a long-distance
company into a broad-based purveyor of services targeted to a
market where telecom, computing, entertainment and information
services are converging into an estimated $1 trillion business
opportunity.  Beyond that, networkMCI is more than a strategic
vision; it also is a developmental plan that features the
introduction of services in incremental steps to gain a leading
position as an overall provider of communications and
information services.

* MCI on the Internet *

The Internet is central to MCI's plan.  In 1995 there were an
estimated 25 million active Internet e-mail users, between 7
million and 10 million users with full Internet access and 4
million people who use the World Wide Web, an Internet
navigational tool.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that
commerce on the Internet, actually a supernetwork comprising
40,000 independent but connected networks, could reach the $100
million level as early as late 1995.

MCI has long been involved with the development of the Internet,
the network aspects of which are addressed in Chapter Six of
this report.  In terms of providing access to and service via
the Internet, MCI has introduced two service offerings since
mid-1994 which enhance Internet connectivity, as well as PC-
based applications:  the internetMCI software package and
marketplaceMCI.  In turn, both of these are wrapped within
networkMCI Business, a composite information and communications
package.  In addition, in 1994 MCI introduced internetMCI Access
Service which targets the larger education, government, and
business communities with a range of Internet access services,
as well as expanded e-mail service which allows Internet users
to utilize MCI Mail.

* networkMCI Business *

networkMCI Business is a Windows-based communications and
information software package targeted to the small and medium-
sized business community.  Originally introduced in October
1994, the latest version 3.0 was debuted at the COMDEX trade
show in Atlanta in April 1995.  In conjunction with the 1994
launch of the product, MCI reported incremental expenses of $70
million that contributed to an increase in operating expenses in
1994.  Although the software package is touted as an integrated
information and communications package, it is in reality a group
of separate applications linked only by Windows.

Introduced commercially in late September 1995, the package
features infoMCI, conferenceMCI, marketplaceMCI, faxMCI, e-
mailMCI, networkMCI paging and internetMCI.  The package is the
result of collaboration with numerous firms:  internetMCI was
developed in cooperation with Netscape Communications, FTP
Software and RSA Data Security; e-mailMCI is a licensed
application from ConnectSoft; networkMCI Paging is provided via
a reselling agreement with SkyTel; and faxMCI is a licensed
version of Delrina's WinFax PRO.  Other collaborators include
PictureTel Corp., Databeam Corp, FYI Online and Image Technology
Inc.

MCI indicated that the latest version of the package would be
provided free of charge to existing customers and run at the
price of $100 for new customers.  Further, the company indicated
the new offering would be accompanied by a drop in the monthly
subscription rate of $65 ($50 for Vnet, Vision or Preferred
customers) to $45 ($35 for Vnet, Vision and Preferred
customers).  Some of the standard components of the networkMCI
Business software package are also offered independently.

internetMCI - a "load and go" Internet access and navigation
software package which is also offered independently for $39.95
plus monthly access charges.  The offering provides local and
toll-free dial-up and graphical user interface (GUI) point-and-
click navigation.

marketplaceMCI - a multimedia on-line catalog and business
purchasing service providing businesses a new way to distribute
product information and facilitate on-line sales.  Brought
online in March 1995, marketplaceMCI opened with 14
"storefronts" to comprise an electronic mall:  Dun & Bradstreet
Information Services, Hammacher Schlemmer & Co., Office Max
Inc.; Intercontinental Florists, Danmark International, PC Zone
and Mac Zone, Reiter's Scientific & Professional Books, QUALCOMM
Inc., Reveal Computer Products, Covey, Proxima Inc., Doneckers,
FTP Software Inc. and National Wildlife Galleries Inc.  MCI
indicated that several more companies will open shops in the
electronic mall including: Aetna Life and Casualty, Amtrak,
Borders Inc., Dell Computers, Healthrider, Sara Lee, Tiger
Direct and Timberland.  The site is made possible by RSA Data
Security Inc.'s public-key cryptography which encrypts all
transactions involving sensitive information such as credit-card
numbers.  MCI has also taken measures to ensure the security of
the merchant web-site contents.

infoMCI - delivers to the customer news stories twice a day, as
well as instant news flashes on breaking stories.  The
information delivered is based upon a customer-defined profile.
The customer can select one industry category from a list of 25,
and specify key terms within an industry or company.  The
announced offering will also include business retrospective
search capabilities, weekly industry summaries, and special
business news reports.

conferenceMCI  - employing the yet-to-be-adopted T.120 document
and conferencing "standard", this tool allows people in
disparate locations to share documents including spreadsheets
and art for collaborative efforts.  conferenceMCI allows for the
connection of up to 24 locations, as well as simultaneous voice
and document conferencing.  Optional video conferencing is
available, but requires either the purchase or lease of needed
desktop video equipment.

e-mailMCI - provides users access to e-mail and gateways to
numerous other e-mail services.

faxMCI - provides the ability to send and receive faxes via the
PC from any Windows application.

* internetMCI Access Service *

internetMCI Access Service was introduced in mid-1994 and geared
to the education, government and business communities.  MCI
offers a variety of access services, including dedicated access
at 9.6 Kbps, 14.4 Kbps or 28.8 Kbps and switched access at the
same speeds; direct connect, a private line-like connection at
speeds from 9.6 Kbps to 45 Mbps; and frame relay.  In addition,
MCI announced that by the end of 1995 it planned to make
available high-speed access via Hyperstream ATM and Hyperstream
SMDS.

AT&T AND BIRLA GROUP WIN TWO CELLULAR LICENSES IN INDIA

AT&T and its partner in India, the Aditya V. Birla Group,
recently got the go-ahead to build infrastructure and to provide
cellular service in two regions in that country.

The regions AT&T won are Gujarat and Mahahashtra.  The licenses
are considered two of the more lucrative in India, with 43
million potential subscribers and 74 million potential
subscribers, respectively.

The companies, operating under the name Birla Communications
Ltd, bid on the licenses last June and received confirmation of
the award in early November.  Last month the partners signed a
final licensing agreement and plunked down a $90 million, first
year, licensing payment to the government.

AT&T filed an application with New Jersey regulators recently,
asking for the green light to offer local service to consumers
and businesses in that state.  The New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities last month began discussing opening the market for
local service.  AT&T, in the filing, outlined the general terms
and conditions under which the carrier plans to offer local
service in the Garden State, including reselling services from
the incumbent RBOC, Bell Atlantic.

The petition also called for number portability and intraLATA
presubscription in local competition.  The New Jersey request
comes at the same time as similar petitions in Maryland and
Georgia.

NEW YEAR WILL FEATURE SATELLITE BROADCASTING, MOBILE SERVICES 

     Direct-to-home (DTH) satellite broadcast services will be one of
the top stories during the next 12 months--for the third straight
year--along with progress in developing global, mobile satellite
communication systems and new, more reliable launch vehicles, an array
of industry leaders told SATELLITE NEWS last week in our annual Look-
ahead Survey.
     Satellite broadcasting equipment has become the fastest-selling
product in consumer electronics history and shows no signs of slowing
as deep-pocketed companies attempt to launch such services throughout
the world in '96, sources said.  And, the rush for others to provide
global, mobile services by 2000 will intensify as those systems
prepare to launch their first satellites on rockets that suffered some
failures in '95.
     Chuck Hewitt, president of the Satellite Broadcasting and
Communications Association (SBCA), said, "We think 1996 will see
continued expansion of the
direct-to-home industry with the introduction of several new players. 
That expansion includes the successful launch of the EchoStar
Communications Corp. system [see related story on p. 1] and the soon-
to-be introduced AlphaStar DTH system.  These new systems will
continue to expand the level of choice available to the consumer. 
And, we'll see the introduction of additional, niche market
programming services which will be unique to the satellite
marketplace.  Many of those programs will not be available on cable."
     A similar bullish view about DTH was offered by Bruce Crockett,
president and CEO of Comsat Corp..
     "Comsat's recent $100 million contract with News Corp. to provide
direct-to-home broadcasting in Latin America demonstrates that DTH
continues to expand in every region of the world," Crockett said. 
"News Corp. is repeating the success it has enjoyed in Europe and
Asia.  At the same time, DirecTv created the market in the U.S. and
now is being joined by other operators like PrimeStar and Echostar.
     "All of these pioneers have set the stage for a booming
international business in the second half of the '90s.  Eastern
Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa are hot markets to watch,"
Crockett said.
     DirecTv, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., reached 1 million
subscribers for its direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service in the
United States this year, said Donald Cromer, president of Hughes Space
and Communications Co.  For '96, the big story will be progress in
developing satellite systems, such as Hughes' Spaceway project, to
offer interactive bandwidth applications, he said.

  ...Money, Money, Money Will Decide Winners in '96

     "For 1996, the story is going to be money, money, money--DBS
auctions, fundraising for the Big LEOs and other satellite ventures,
and whether Constellation Communications, American Mobile Satellite
Corp. and Ellipsat make their financial showing to obtain Big LEO
licenses by the end of January 1996," said Tim Logue, a space and
telecommunications analyst with the law firm Reid & Priest, of
Washington, D.C.
     Logue continued, "I believe the financial markets are
increasingly sophisticated about satellite communications.  That
means, however, that they are much less likely to be bowled over by
'gee whiz' types of presentations.  They understand the business and
understand full well the high risks involved.
     "Therefore, satellite companies have to do a better job of
presenting their business cases and offerings to the financial
community.  Anything that would reduce risk would be helpful, as well,
like improving launch vehicle reliability," Logue added.
     Hewitt said, "We believe that Wall Street's understanding of the
role that satellite communication plays in the Information
Superhighway has increased substantially in the past 12-18 months.  In
particular, SBCA has developed Wall 
Street's understanding of the direct-to-home marketplace through our
association's SkyForum conference that is held twice a year in New
York."
     The financial community is starting to recognize the growth
potential of satellite systems, Cromer said.
     ICO Global Communications Inc., a for-profit, spin-off of the
world's mobile satellite consortium Inmarsat, raised $1.4 billion from
its Signatories.  and was forced to turn away hundreds of millions of
dollars from some 40 investors interested in backing the
organization's planned 12-satellite, $2.6 billion system to provide
global, mobile communications (SN, Jan. 23, 1995, pp. 1-3).  Hughes
became an ICO investor late last year.
     "The $5.7 billion backlog in satellite orders for Hughes--double
last year's backlog--is some indication that new ventures are finding
the capital needed for satellite communications systems," Cromer said.

  ...Financing Generally Is Tight, Tight, Tight

     "Some, however, such as Iridium [Inc.] and Globalstar pulled
their [debt] offerings soon after they were released," Cromer said. 
"I believe financial backing will continue to become available in the
future as more satellite programs are proven and business cases are
demonstrated."
     Bruce Gerding, managing director of Odyssey Telecommunications
International Inc., said, "As more satellite financing deals are
brought to market, investors are beginning to understand them better
and deals are getting done, as evidenced by the completion in 1995 of
the PanAmSat, Orion and Globalstar initial public offerings and the
PanAmSat high-yield offering, among others.  Although some satellite
financing attempts failed this year, I believe that financial backing
will become more available in the future as risks are better
understood and more properly structured satellite deals are brought to
market."
     A less-optimistic view was offered by Ahmad Ghais, a satellite
industry consultant and the former director of engineering and
operations at Inmarsat.  Ghais warned financial markets may not become
more generous in the future.
     "Financial markets will recognize that not all contenders have
staying power, so they will be very selective in backing them," Ghais
said.  "That will lead to a shake out, beginning visibly in '96.  Who
will survive?  That is the question financing sources will need the
most expert help on."   
     Another consultant, Ed Martin, a former executive with Comsat
Corp., said, "Only a few, at most, of the new systems will achieve
financial success." 

  ...WRC 95 Spurs Optimism

     Many prospective global, mobile communications systems gained
immensely from the allocation of substantial spectrum for their
services at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95) that
ended Nov. 12.
     Russell Daggatt, president of Teledesic Corp., said, "WRC has
left us very optimistic about the future.  We now are prepared to move
forward with the project.  I would expect us to bring on a few key
partners in '96.  The objective in '96 is not so much money, because
we are adequately capitalized for the time being, but we need to begin
putting our global partnership into shape."
     Odyssey's Gerding added: "WRC-95 showed terrific cooperation
between the satellite industry and the U.S. government delegation.  As
a result of their successful efforts, Odyssey has obtained its
frequencies, as planned; that accomplishment has been well received by
our backers."
     Scott Harris, chief of the FCC's International Bureau, said, "The
success of the U.S. delegation at WRC-95, which built upon and
expanded past successes, was another giant step forward for global
satellite systems.  This success was evidenced not only by the
spectrum allocated, but also in the commitment to such systems
demonstrated by the vast majority of ITU member states."
     Ghais countered, however, the allocations do not preclude
disputes erupting between satellite and terrestrial users that must
share the spectrum.
     Joseph Krabacher, managing director of Informcosmosconsult LLC,
agreed.
     "We are concerned about the broadband MSS frequency allocation
due to anticipated technical coordination problems and the potential
for a company such as Teledesic to obtain monopolistic advantages,"
Krabacher said.
     Informcosmosconsult is a U.S.-based marketing and legal
consulting firm that represents a number of Russian government and
industry clients.
     The SBCA's Hewitt said, "With the Satellite Industry Association
operating as an independent arm of the SBCA, and having
representatives on the SBCA board of directors, we're very pleased to
see the satellite-related spectrum allocations that were granted by
WRC-95."

  ...Launch Reliability Remains in Question

     Many observers thought one of the biggest stories of the past 12
to 18 months was the partial or total failure of at least one launch
each by Arianespace, Lockheed Martin Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
Orbital Sciences Corp., EER Systems Inc. and China Great Wall Corp. 
New rockets intended to carry small- and mid-sized commercial payloads
performed the worst with three consecutive failures (SN, Oct. 30,
1995, pp. 1-3).
     Irving Goldstein, director general and CEO of Intelsat, said
launchers needed to become far more reliable in the future.  And those
launchers also must provide their services at a reasonable cost, he
added.  Some launchers are charging upward of $100 million for each
launch.
     "Even though satellite communications is a relatively mature
industry, there still is a fair amount of risk associated with getting
spacecraft into orbit and in service for their entire lifetime,"
Goldstein said.  "Over the past year, the industry has experienced its
share of launch vehicle failures and delays, complicating an already
tight overall industry launch manifest.  While there have been some
positive trends, such as [Lockheed's] expanding launch capabilities
and progress on the Ariane 5, there still is considerable room to
improve the range of launch vehicle choices, scheduling options and
costs."
     He Xing, vice general manager of the space division at China
Great Wall, said 1996 will be an important year for new rockets that
launch big payloads.
     "The more powerful major launch vehicles, such as Ariane 5, Long
March 3B and 3C, will all experience their maiden flights, and
something new will also be brought about with Delta 3, Zenit and
Proton," Xing said.  "The world will suddenly receive such a large
number of new launch vehicles.  Fortunately or unfortunately, the
satellite operators will find it very difficult to distinguish and to
choose their favorite launch services package."

  ...Orbital Slot Disputes Will Spark Litigation in '96

     One negative development that will emerge this year is the
problem of orbital congestion between satellites, said Delbert Smith,
a partner with the Washington, D.C., law firm Reed Smith Shaw &
McClay.
     "I'm predicting the first, formal litigation or arbitration will
take place in 1996 dealing with disputed orbital arc locations," Smith
said.  "We've come very close in the recent past with four or five
instances of orbital arc disputes.  Each of these times the disputes
have been settled at the 11th hour through negotiation and
coordination.  Now, the stakes are much larger.
     "The companies are much bigger and their markets are much larger,
particularly for broadcasters.  These are major corporate entities. 
They have much to lose, and therefore the protection of their
corporate assets will become a prime motivating factor in their
ability to continue to raise financing."
     Past disputes about orbital positions largely have been limited
to technical issues, not commercial ones, Smith said.

U.S. DELEGATION WINS WRC-95 BATTLES WITH LOBBYING CAMPAIGN

     The U.S. delegation to the World Radiocommunication Conference
(WRC 95) last fall gained critical new spectrum allocations for some
proposed, global mobile telephony services, but used some
unconventional lobbying activities previously not seen at any of the
past conferences, some satellite industry insiders said.
     In one instance, the U.S. pressured other delegations to support
an allocation for Teledesic Corp., the U.S.-based company that plans
to offer broadband communication services via 840 low-Earth-orbit
satellites by 2001.
     Teledesic aided its cause by serving members of the various
delegations an assortment of goodies that included pizza, beer, ice
cream, tote bags, hats and notebooks, said Leslie Taylor, who heads
the Bethesda, Md.-based satellite consulting firm Leslie Taylor
Associates Inc.

  ...Promising Free Service Usually Works, Too!

     The strategy worked because the WRC allocated 400 MHz in Ka-band
for non-geostationary fixed services, such as Teledesic.  And, the
allocation of an additional 100 MHz for such services was placed on
the agenda for WRC-97.
     Teledesic won another victory when the conference adopted a
precedent-setting "freeze" on the filing of new geostationary or non-
geostationary fixed satellite services (FSS) before the end of WRC-97,
Taylor said.  That gives Teledesic extra time to win votes for the
additional 100 MHz allocation.
     To curry further backing, Teledesic promised two years of free
service in certain parts of the world, Taylor added.  Teledesic
President Russell Daggatt said his system won broad support on its
merits.
     The U.S. negotiators pressed their counterparts from other
countries for quick action on a number of key mobile satellite
spectrum allocations, said Taylor, who accompanied the U.S. delegation
in Geneva.
     Although the lobbying was cranked up at this WRC, FCC
Commissioner Susan Ness said the U.S. achieved some important gains
for Teledesic and others.  Ness praised delegation head Amb. Brian
Fontes for winning support on several key issues for U.S. mobile
satellite ventures.  Ness was part of the delegation.

FCC CLEARS PATH FOR FCC DBS AUCTIONS FOR JANUARY 18

     FCC commissioners voted unanimously late last month to hold the
long-awaited and much-anticipated auctions for 52 DBS channels split
between the 110 degrees W and 148 degrees W orbital slots on Jan. 18.
     Commissioners also voted to restrict current DBS operators from
participating in the auction.  A "single spectrum cap" will limit
companies from controlling more than one full-continental U.S. orbital
slot.  As a result, DirecTv Inc., EchoStar Corp. and United States
Satellite Broadcasting Co. Inc. (USSB), as well as other DBS
permittees, will not be allowed to bid on the frequencies unless they
divest their other licenses.
     The commission, however, did not prevent cable TV companies and
multiple system operators (MSOs) from bidding on the valuable
spectrum.
     A host of communications giants are thought to be interested in
bidding on the frequencies including, MCI Corp., backed by Rupert
Murdoch, Bell Atlantic Corp., Nynex Corp., U S West, BellSouth Corp.
and, of course, TeleCommunications Inc., the nation's largest cable
MSO.
     Indeed, MCI already has announced it will open the auctions, the
first in the history of the satellite industry, with an initial bid of
$175 million.

  ...How Will the Auctions Be Conducted?

     The electronic auctions will be held in sequential, multiple
rounds that will grant two permits, one for 28 channels at 110 degrees
W and the other for 24 frequencies at 148 degrees W--the spectrum
formerly licensed to Advanced Communications Corp., of Little Rock,
Ark., and Tempo Satellite Corp.

SATELLITE SPOTLIGHT: NEW SAT-BASED TRACKING SYSTEM INTRODUCED

     Fairfax, Va.-based Arrowhead Space & Telecommunications Inc.
(Arrowhead) has introduced a new vehicle monitoring and security
system (VMSS).  The new product will be available through Arrowhead
Technologies Inc., a division of Arrowhead Space & Telecommunications,
located in Newport News, Va.
     The VMSS is designed to solve two short- and long-haul trucking
problems: trailer hijacking and cargo theft.  It also functions as a
dynamic location device providing real time automatic updates
displayed on high-resolution maps.
     Arrowhead said the benefits of VMSS include reduced cargo
insurance premiums, improved loss control and less pass-through of
costs resulting from theft.  The VMSS is incident-driven and can be
interfaced with a wide variety of nationwide communications networks. 
The entire system is battery operated and completely independent of a
trailer's electrical system.
     "VMSS is an extension of our automated vehicle location product,"
said Mary Ann Elliott, president and CEO of Arrowhead.  "With VMSS, a
firm can determine a vehicle's exact location, status of the engine,
accumulated mileage, intrusion and security status.  It's the
difference between a home burgler alarm and a full-home monitoring and
security system."
     VMSS combines a computer processor, a global positioning system
(GPS) receiver, up to 24 sensor alarms, eight analog and six digital
inputs.  The entire system occupies a space approximately five inches
square and two inches deep.  The system also provides all weather
positions, heading and time information.  (Arrowhead Space &
Telecommunications Inc., 3040 Williams Drive, Suite 201, Fairfax, VA

BILL GATES ENVISIONS WALLET PCS AS A WAY TO USE TELEDESIC SYSTEM

     Billionaire businessman Bill Gates recently shared his dream
about developing wallet-sized personal computers that people could
carry anywhere to use with his planned Teledesic Corp. satellite
system.
     The Teledesic system, which Gates and telecommunications mogul
Craig McCaw are backing with seed money, is intended to provide
global, broadband communications services via a constellation of 840
low-Earth-orbit satellites beginning in 2001.  Gates envisions the
"wallet PCs" becoming one of many products that would use his proposed
system.
     Those wallet PCs would contain people's credit cards, tickets,
phone numbers, keys and additional information, said Gates, the
founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp. , of Redmond, Wash.
     "All of that literally will be available when you have a wireless
network in place," Gates said during a recent Smithsonian Institution
speech here.
     Craig Mundie, senior vice president of the consumer systems
division at Microsoft Corp., told SATELLITE NEWS Editor Paul Dykewicz,
"The advantage of Teledesic is it has the prospect of becoming a
broadband equivalent to cellular. I think there are other advantages,
particularly in lesser-developed countries.  But, there still is not
enough capacity in the satellite system to see that as an alternative
for the fiber optic network that we would have on the ground.
     Wallet PCs clearly would need to use some form of a broadband
delivery system, said Mundie, who added Teledesic could be one of the
answers.
     "Today, it doesn't exist," Mundie said.  "It might take Teledesic
or something akin to that to produce that kind of capability.  Our
goal is to write software for these families of products.  We're real
advocates of any communications technology that produces more
connectivity between communications and computers.  It gives us an
opportunity to write more software."

  ...Wallet PCs Are a Futuristic Concept

     Jon Magill, group product manager of Microsoft's personal systems
division, said wallet PCs are a "futuristic concept, not a product or
project announcement."
     "Coverage provided by satellite networks certainly would enable
people to go anywhere in the world," Magill said.  "But, more cost-
effective local wireless solutions would probably be the kind of
things you would see sooner rather than later."
     The wallet PCs could take various forms.  The PCs may include a
video screen and easily fit into a person's pocket, Magill said. 
Microsoft likely would not manufacture the PCs, since its specialty is
software.
     The applications of a wallet PC could include electronic commerce
or interacting with ATMs at local banks, Magill said.  The wallet also
could carry digitized photographs of family members, he added.  A
wallet PC could be the size of a pager or a personal organizer, Magill
said.
     "It also could be an extension of the watch that we worked on
with Timex not too long ago," Magill said.  "You could imagine it
taking on a form factor not too dissimilar from a checkbook."
     Magill said the device would need to be small enough for people
to carry it with them all the time.  The PC also would serve as an
electronic badge that provide identification for people, he added.
     "It could also have some interactions with a house," Magill said. 
"When a person approaches his or her home, the device could signal for
the garage door to open and the house lights to turn on."
     Magill added, "It can take away many of the mundane things that
we need to do day-to-day."

U.S. PLANS TO UPDATE LAUNCH PACT WITH RUSSIA TO CREATE PARITY

     U.S. government officials are expected to offer Russia an
opportunity to launch up to 20 U.S. commercial payloads into
geostationary orbit by the end of 2001.
     Indeed, negotiators from the two countries likely will meet in
the coming months, well-placed sources said.
     Such an offer would give Russia a similar deal to the one reached
last month with the Ukraine and another deal struck last year between
China and the United States, the sources said.  However, the U.S.
position has yet to be finalized and no firm dates have been set to
begin talks with the Russians, the sources added.
     The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has not issued a
formal U.S.  position about what Russia will be offered in any such
talks.  However, some senior officials in the Clinton administration
support giving the Russians parity with the Ukraine and China, which
have received permission to launch up to 20 U.S. commercial payloads
each into geostationary orbit by the end of 2001.
     Russia currently has a deal that limits it to nine launches of
U.S. commercial satellites by the end of 2001.  The gap has caused the
Russians to call for a review of their deal.  Such a request likely
will be honored early this year.
     On the other hand, McDonnell Douglas Corp. officials have
complained their company's plans to develop a Delta 3 rocket have been
undermined by the U.S. policy of rapidly increasing the number of
foreign launches of U.S. commercial satellites during the last two
years.  Launchers from non-market countries receive subsidies from
their governments that give them an unfair pricing advantage, those
McDonnell Douglas officials charge.

  ...U.S. Official Defends Deal

     Frank Weaver, associate administrator for the Transportation
Department's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), said
the agreement includes a variety of pricing factors to ensure an even
playing field.
     "The purpose of that [language] is just to ensure that our
providers have been given fair consideration," Weaver said.  "That
will not necessarily stop a satellite service provider from going
forward [and using a foreign launcher].  But we do want to make sure
that the U.S. launch industry has an opportunity to be fairly
considered in the deployment of anything."
     The latest U.S. launch pact allows the Ukraine to win up to five
contracts for geostationary launches.  An additional 11 GEO launches
also could be won by an international partnership with Ukrainian
participation.
     Those 11 sea-based launches would be conducted by a joint venture
that includes a subsidiary of the Boeing Co. [BA] (SN, Dec. 18, 1995,
p. 10).  Up to four other launches--three involving the Boeing
venture--may be permitted if the demand for launches grows during the
life of the agreement.
     Boeing, which will manage the joint venture, must obtain a
license to conduct launches on behalf of the partnership, Weaver said
in a recent news briefing about the deal.  Boeing's joint venture
includes Russia's RSC Energia, the Ukraine's NPO Yuzhnoye and Norway's
Kvaerner a.s.
     The partnership is intended to build a launch infrastructure on
an ocean-going platform and conduct launches from international waters
in the Pacific Ocean.  The U.S. government had refused to allow the
partnership to launch any U.S. commercial payloads until the trade
deal with the Ukraine had been reached.
     In contrast, Lockheed Martin Corp. is not required to obtain a
license for its role as the marketing agent for launches provided by
Russia's Khrunichev Enterprise and NPO Energia.
Commercial Satellites Play Role in Bosnia Space-based assets, many of
them owned and operated by commercial entities, will play a vital role
in the U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, a U.S. Air Force
official said recently.  A mixed fleet of commercial and military
satellites are being used for a variety of applications, including
communications and reconnaissance, said Maj. Gen. David Vesely,
commander of the 14th Air Force.  Heavy demands on the military's own
communications system--the Defense Satellite Communications System
(DSCS)--during Operation Desert Storm demonstrated the need for more
bandwidth during large-scale operations, reports our sister
publication DEFENSE DAILY.  Since then, the Pentagon has begun to
exploit the capabilities of commercial satellites for some of its
communications needs, especially for high data-rate transmissions,
Pentagon officials said.  DSCS is being augmented by commercial
communications satellites and those owned by NATO for Bosnian mission. 
These satellites recently have undergone "minor repositioning" to
optimize their use in the Bosnian theater, Vesely said.  The military
also is using commercial remote sensing systems, in addition to its
own reconnaissance satellites, in support of the Bosnia mission. 
Multispectral imagery provided by the Spot satellite system, owned by
Spot Image Corp., already is being fed directly into the European
theater from Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and plans are currently in
the works to set up a similar feed from U.S. Landsat satellites. 
Other space-based assets at use in the Bosnian theater include
military and commercial weather satellites, and the Pentagon's Global
Positioning Satellite (GPS) system.

SATELLITE BRIEFS

McDonnell Douglas Conducts Tests on Potential EELV Engine
     McDonnell Douglas Corp. successfully completed tests for a liquid
hydrogen, liquid oxygen rocket engine that the company hopes to use in
its Delta 4 family of boosters being developed for the U.S. Air
Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, the company
said recently.  The tests, which occurred in October at NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., were conducted on
the RS-68 engine built by Rockwell Corp. subsidiary Rocketdyne. 
Rocketdyne is working with Mac-Dac to develop the main engine for the
Delta 4 boosters.  The tests involved varying the mixture ratios of
the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to determine combustion
efficiencies.  Four industry teams--Alliant Techsystems, Boeing Inc.,
Lockheed Martin Corp., and Mac-Dac--are engaged in low-cost concept
validation studies, the first phase of the EELV effort to develop a
single family of launch vehicles and reduce space launch operations by
25 to 50 percent.

Ariane 5 Debut Set for May 1996
     After last month's successful test of the cryogenic main stage to
be used in Europe's Ariane 5 launch vehicle, Arianespace has set a May
7 target date for the rocket's inaugural launch.  Another
qualification test of the main stage is set for this month, and a
first report of the launcher qualification review begun this past June
will be delivered in February, according to the European Space Agency.

AT&T Tridom and ViaSat Ink Pact to Develop New VSAT/Mesh-DAMA Systems
     AT&T Tridom and ViaSat Inc. announced an agreement recently to
develop new products jointly for domestic and international VSAT
customers.  Under the agreement, AT&T Tridom and ViaSat will integrate
their hardware and software technologies to develop VSAT/Mesh-DAMA
(demand assigned multiple access) systems.  AT&T Tridom will begin
offering the new systems in the first quarter of this year as an
enhancement to its line of high-capacity VSAT data transmission
systems and voice networks.  (AT&T Tridom, 908/221-4178.)

Uniden Introduces Its DSS System
     Fort Worth, Texas-based Uniden America Corp. has introduced the
Uniden-brand Digital Satellite System (DSS) hardware.  The Uniden
units feature event 
timers, front displays and channel access and universal remote
controls.  The company said these features will increase consumer
demand for the hardware.  "Uniden has always had the biggest share of
the C-band market," said Tony Mirabelli, Uniden's vice president of
   Uniden's UDS 200 DSS Hardware   marketing.  "We know what features
are popular with consumers and we've designed those into the Uniden-
brand DSS receiver."  (Uniden America Corp., 4700 Amon Carter Blvd.,
Ft. Worth, TX 76155, 817/858-3300.)

British Telecom Opens Gateway for Access to PanAmSat
     British Telecom opened an earth station in the United Kingdom
that will enable broadcasters to access PanAmSat Corp.'s PAS 4
satellite.  The PAS 4 footprint covers Africa, Asia, Europe, the
Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.  BT and PanAmSat also have a
joint marketing deal to attract broadcast customers; the two
companies' first customer is Doordarshan, India's national
broadcaster.  Separately, Hong Kong-based Television Broadcasts
Limited International (TBLI) chose PanAmSat's PAS 2 satellite for C-
band broadcasting.  The company already leases a Ku-band transponder
on PAS 2.  TVBI will uplink its programming from Hong Kong for
distribution throughout Asia.  (PanAmSat, 203/622-6664.)

Global Access Expands Asian, European Operations 
     Global Access Telecommunications Services Inc., the Boston-based
provider of satellite and fiber broadcast services, opened an office
in Singapore to coordinate its Asia-Pacific business.  The office will
handle broadcast services for clients including ESPN in Singapore,
Hong Kong's Star TV and Japan's Fuji Television and Nippon Television. 
Telecom veteran Simon Patch will head Global Access' Asian subsidiary,
Global Satellite and Video Services (Asia) Pte Ltd.
Separately, Global Access launched European broadcast services from
its United Kingdom subsidiary.  Previously the company served Europe
from its U.S. office.  The company also announced a bulk buy of C- and
Ku-band transponder capacity off PanAmSat Corp.'s  four satellites. 
(Global Access, 617/624-7431.)

Primestar-commissioned Survey Puts Whoopi and Tom at the Top
     A recent survey conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide for Primestar
Partners found actors Whoopi Goldberg and Tom Hanks top the list of
actors Americans most want to see in a new holiday movie.  The movie
"Miracle on 34th Street" came first in the favorite holiday movie
sweepstakes, while in the animated-movie derby, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer" swept the competition with a commanding 60 percent favorite
rating.  "Rudolph" has been seen approximately 2.5 billion times by
U.S. adults, the study found.  "At Primestar, we know that movies are
as much a part of the holidays as gift-giving and turkey, which is why
American families can find so many of their favorite holiday movie
selections on our digital TV entertainment service," said a Primestar
executive in a statement.
(Primestar Partners, 610/617-5446.)

DirecTv Expands Free Hotel Service
     Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary DirecTv Inc. expanded its
"free-to-guest" hotel programming packages, with the Best Western
International hotel chain signing up as its first customer.  Best
Western is scheduled to begin offering the service this month.  Other
target areas include hospitals, dormitories and office buildings. 
(DirecTv Inc., 310/535-5062.)

           Welcome to the first issue of THE SPECTRUM REPORT, the
latest addition to the Phillips Publishing, Inc. family of
newsletters.
           The battle for radio frequency among competing services
is heating up, and the issues surrounding its allocation are
becoming increasingly critical to all services that use spectrum.
Spectrum issues are a growing concern to the readers of
INDUSTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS, PCN NEWS, SATELLITE NEWS, MOBILE
SATELLITE NEWS, DBS NEWS and MOBILE PHONE NEWS.  To give our
readers the breadth of perspective needed to protect their
interests in this battle, THE SPECTRUM REPORT provides
comprehensive news and analysis on spectrum allocation issues
across all services.
           Every other week, THE SPECTRUM REPORT will provide the
most in-depth coverage of issues critical to the global
allocation of frequency including regulatory actions, WARC '92,
new technologies and international coverage.  Now here's the
news:

BROADCASTERS MAY BE HIT WITH SPECTRUM TAX; NAB READY TO FIGHT

           The Treasury Department is rumored to be drafting
spectrum tax legislation to combat the growing deficit; the
National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) said it is prepared to
fight.  The federal government is "desperate for money" and on
the surface this is an attractive idea, NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel
told THE SPECTRUM REPORT.  The Congressional Budget Office
estimated the deficit for fiscal year 1991 at $253 billion and
$262 billion the following year.
           Administration officials had drafted similar
legislation last year in an effort to cut the budget deficit by
$50 billion.  Under the previous plan, most stations would be
required to pay 5% of their annual revenue for use of the
spectrum.  Smaller broadcasters--television stations generating
less than $2 million in annual revenues and radio stations making
less than $100,000 per year--would be required to pay 2.5% of
their revenues.
           "It's pretty clear that once on the table, you never
get off the table," Wurfel said.  We feel it will be part of the
budget plan in some way, he added.
           The NAB is opposed to a spectrum tax, said Wurfel.  "We
don't believe it would be fair to tax broadcasters because
broadcasters provide a lot of community service," he told us.
           Wurfel said he wanted to make it clear that NAB is
opposed to a tax--a fee assessed annually on all broadcasters.  A
tax is not the same as a spectrum fee such as a one time charge
on newly unallocated spectrum, he said.
           "That's not to say we are for fees of any kind or [for]
spectrum auctions--we've never really been enthusiastic about
anything that represents fees on spectrum," Wurfel told us.
           Wurfel said there will be hearings in the spring.
"Some believe we need to pay more than simply providing public
service.  We'll be preparing for these hearings and discussions
on the Hill to point out what broadcasters do for the community
and the responsibilities we take--which is the way we pay for
spectrum," he said.
           The bill is said to be drafted so that it would fall
under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance and House Ways and
Means Committees rather than the Commerce Committees.
Broadcasters also are against this set-up of the bill because the
Commerce Committee handles broadcast issues and thus, has a
better understanding of the industry.
           NAB said the first place it expects to see spectrum
fees is when President Bush sends his budget to Congress--the
first Monday in February.  It has been rumored that the president
will mention it in his State of the Union address but, Wurfel
said that "it's an outside chance."

The Dingell Bill Will Come to Life Again This Year

           Although broadcasters may be hit by a spectrum tax,
some good news still may come for other spectrum users in the
legislative process.  Dennis Fitzgibbons, spokesman for House and
Energy Commerce Committee, told THE SPECTRUM REPORT that the bill
introduced by House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D-
Mich.) will, indeed, be introduced again early this session.  "It
will be much the same bill as before," Fitzgibbons told us.
           The Dingell bill, if passed, will free up some 200 MHz
of government-owned spectrum.  The bill passed the House last
year but not the Senate.  "Essentially the bill sets up a
mechanism in which commercial users could use the spectrum," said
Fitzgibbons.
           "For 20 years or more there has been talk of some type
of transfer of federal spectrum to the private sector.  This is
the first concrete move in that direction.  We have to recognize
John Dingell for his foresight," E.B. Kitchen, president of the
National Association of Business & Educational Radio told us.

Kitchen: Auctions May Have Held the Dingell Bill Up Last Year

           Kitchen said he believed the bill faired well by
passing the House but not the Senate, and that he was
"optimistic" that it will pass the next time.  "The hangup was
the whole issue of auctions.  The bill had language that
prohibited the auction of the 200 MHz of government spectrum and
the Republicans did not want that limitation--they wanted that
option," said Kitchen.
           The bill probably will be reintroduced without that
language, Kitchen speculated.  If the bill does not include the
auction clause, Kitchen said he believed the bill will pass.
           "I would rather have the Dingell bill pass even without
the auction exclusion.  We'll fight the auction battle another
day," added Kitchen.
           Hearings and mark-ups for the Dingell bill probably
will occur in February, Fitzgibbons told us.

FCC RADIO CHIEF SAYS TECHNOLOGY
GREATEST HOPE IN SPECTRUM FIGHT

           Emphasizing the need for improved technologies and more
efficient use of existing radio spectrum, Ralph Haller, chief of
the FCC's Private Radio Bureau said, "the current lack of
spectrum has troublesome competitive implications for our
country."
     Speaking at the recent general membership session of the
Special Industrial Radio Service Association Inc. (SIRSA) in San
Diego, Calif., Haller stressed the importance of radio.  "When
economic times are tough, radio's ability to save time and money
assumes ever greater importance," he said.
     Haller pointed to several time saving devices of the radio
including radio controlled traffic lights that enable traffic to
flow more quickly, security devices that call the police when
someone steals your car and vast pipeline networks across the
United States which are controlled remotely via radio links.
Haller said radio also offers new technologies for the future.
For instance, up-to-date maps displayed on the dashboard of cars
and personal communication devices.  But, he said the downside to
"all of these nifty new uses" is that they require spectrum.
           "For those of you out there who are accustomed to
thinking about radio frequencies in proprietary terms, I think it
is going to be harder and harder to maintain high walls around
`your' frequencies," said Haller.  As spectrum becomes more
valuable, those who don't use their frequencies will find
themselves under pressure from those who have an immediate and
pressing need for them," he added.

What are the Answers?

           Haller said there probably will be a need for channel
pools to serve the radio users with similar interests.  The
National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), a unit of the Commerce Department, is encouraging federal
agencies to pool their channels to operate trunked systems.  NTIA
has released a request for proposals that might result in trunked
multi-user systems that are managed by private companies.
           "I also think that more spectrum sharing will be one
response to try to accommodate these needs," said Haller, "and I
don't necessarily mean sharing in the traditional sense."  By
using digital packet radio to fill pockets of otherwise dead air
time (the pauses between the words of natural speech),
individuals can increase the amount of frequency sharing without
a perceptible increase in channel congestion, said Haller.
           "Technology, of course, is the greatest hope for
spectrum salvation," he said.  Haller said the FCC is examining
time division multiple access (TDMA) digital modulation and code
division multiple access (CDMA) technologies to "create" more
spectrum.
           The new transmission schemes, CDMA and TDMA, are
associated most often with personal communication services.
"There is pressure for the U.S. to do even more in this fast
moving area lest we fall behind Europe and Japan," he said.

The FCC Supports New Technologies Through Pioneer Preference

           Haller said the FCC is faced with the task of "trying
to find new ways to do more with less."  The FCC is trying to
accommodate new services through pioneer preference--giving
pioneers of new communication services a preference in the
spectrum allocation process.
           The private radio version of this pioneer's preference
recently was adopted by the FCC.  The commission proposed that
people who find an idle private radio channel that is subject to
FCC takeback be rewarded for their efforts by getting "first
crack" at being licensed on that channel, said Haller.  "In
effect, valuable unused radio spectrum could be recycled," he
explained.
           Another way the Private Radio Bureau is trying to do
more with less is through conditional licensing processing.
Applicants on certain shared private radio frequencies may, if
they certify to having met specific criteria, can begin operation
under temporary authority immediately upon sending their license
documents to the FCC, said Haller.
           In order to "create" more spectrum, said Haller, the
FCC is looking at the possibility of refarming the spectrum below
450 MHz.  "This spectrum is almost always shared and often
crowded--with new technology, we should be able to bring relief
to users," he said.
           Additionally, Haller said the FCC recently concluded an
agreement with the Department of Communications of Canada to use
frequencies in the 821-824/866-869 MHz (public safety) and the
896-901/935-940 MHz (business and industrial land transportation)
bands within 87 miles of the United States and Canadian border.
           "Licensing in the bands can begin immediately which
should result in improved mobile communications service to the
public," said Haller.

What Can Spectrum Users Do?

           The FCC is not the only party with a role to play in
fostering technological advances, innovation, better regulation
and wiser use of the spectrum, said Haller.  As the demand for
spectrum increases, Haller said the FCC will be forced to
encourage spectrum efficiency, even to demand it.
           "I encourage you to start thinking in terms of radio as
a scarce resource than as a box with an antenna that is a minor
adjunct to your main business."

PUBLIC SAFETY LEANING TOWARD FDMA DIGITAL STANDARD

           NEW YORK CITY--Project 25, the brainchild of Associated
Public-Safety Communications Officers (APCO), together with the
National Association of State Telecommunications Directors
(NASTD) and various governmental agencies, is leaning heavily
toward choosing frequency division multiple access (FDMA) in its
quest for a digital standard for public safety radio.
           "[Project 25] made a decision that the future [digital]
public safety systems will use FDMA [frequency division multiple
access], providing an immediate improvement of 2-1," Stuart
Meyer, Project 25 committee member, told an audience recently at
the Technical Symposium at the Radio Club of America's 81st
Anniversary Dinner, held at the New York Athletic Club.
           J. Sharpe Smith, editor of our sister publication
INDUSTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS, was at the dinner and reports that as
soon as better voice coding is developed, a 4-1 spectrum
improvement will be achieved.
           The technical committee of Project 25 has recommended
FDMA, and the steering committee has given its blessing but it
wants more information about which modulation scheme will be
chosen.  The modulation scheme choices include c/4 BPQSK and 4-
Level FSK [frequency shift key].  c/4 requires linear amplifiers,
while the other method does not.

Spectrum Shortage Spurred Digital Standards Development

           In 1988, Congress mandated 6 MHz more spectrum in the
800 MHz band.  Since then, Public Safety has run low of spectrum,
and in some metropolitan areas, has run out.  The FCC has
countered calls for more spectrum allocation with a challenge to
improve spectrum efficiency.  Project 25 was Public Safety's
answer to the FCC.  It probably will go back to the FCC with
suggestions in the next 12-18 months, which may lead to a Notice
of Proposed Rule Making.
           "The FCC has come out with a Notice of Inquiry and said
to Public Safety, `you folks made out pretty good with this
federally mandated spectrum, but what are you going to do about
tomorrow?'" Meyer said.  "The commission went on to suggest that
Public Safety look at more spectrally efficient modulation
techniques in the future."  National Public Safety Planning
Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) developed a channel splitting plan,
from 25-12.5 KHz, which provided an easily implementable plan in
the past.  Meyer, a member of NPSPAC, described the formulation
of digital standards as the next step.
           The committee considered 3 access schemes: code
division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access
(TDMA) and FDMA.  Project 25's major concerns include spectrum
efficiency, encryption and quality of signal.  The committee
decided that CDMA would not fill the needs of Public Safety and
government radio.  "We cannot use CDMA because it requires large
contiguous blocks of spectrum, which we don't have," said Art
McDole, project steering board member and technical advisor.
           TDMA, while popular with the cellular industry, has
some special requirements that hurt it in the Public Safety
arena.  TDMA requires a central controller to select the time
slot.  "When we are looking at a dozen independent police
stations, with a few mobiles each, that don't want to work into a
common system, we start to get problems with TDMA," McDole said.
Another problem of TDMA is its need for linear amplifiers, which
are not as efficient as Class C amplifiers or non-linear
amplifiers, McDole added.
           "We've done a tremendous amount of work with the
manufacturers, weighing the merits of FDMA versus TDMA," McDole
said.  "We have not taken a positive and final action...but we
are leaning heavily toward FDMA, because of the problems of
adapting TDMA to [Public Safety]."

FDMA is Good for Starters

           "FDMA fits into our current time constraints.  It isn't
the step forward that we hoped for.  It is a short-term answer.
What we are looking for is a clear migration to advanced
technology to improve spectrum efficiency," said Craig Jorgensen,
NASTD immediate past president.  "Theoretically, TDMA helps us
with spectrum efficiency, but the linear amplifiers are a
critical issue to power consumption."  There is some question
about a non-ionizing radiation problem with TDMA, which could
cause cell tissue damage to the user, but it hasn't been proven
yet, Jorgensen added.
           "We want to find a migration path to new technology, 4-
5 years down the line, to be more spectrally efficient,"
Jorgensen said.  "We also want flexibility within the standard to
allow for enhanced features."
           Why have standards?  "First, we must intercommunicate.
We must be able to talk with each other during a disaster," said
McDole.
           "There are a thousand reasons that we can't have one
system that can't talk to another."  Standards also allow a user
to have multiple sources and possibly lower prices.

Group Will Study How Digital Modulation Affects Spectrum
Requirements

           Project 25, which has been in existence for one year,
has a steering committee, currently co-chaired by John Powell,
APCO vice president, and Jorgensen.  The steering committee,
which will make the final decision, consists of 3 members of each
organization and 3 members from the federal government.  Two
subcommittees were established under the steering committee: a
technical group and a spectrum group.
           "I think that we've gotten into a huge, huge arena,"
said McDole.  "Recognizing the scope of what we have to do, I
think that we've made excellent progress."
           The technical group is responsible for working out all
of the details of the standard relating to access and modulation
methods.  The spectrum group is concentrating on the logistics of
migrating from analog to digital technology and how it will
affect the spectrum requirements.  Each subcommittee is open to
industry participation.
           "All of the manufacturers are represented on both of
the committees, and we have input from all of the branches of the
federal government," McDole said.  "A number of manufacturers,
including GE and Motorola, have made presentations to the Project
25 committee."

TIA Will Help to Formulate Standards

           In an FCC filing, Project 25 said it looked forward to
working with the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA),
but it officially has not begun its relationship with the
association.  TIA is a trade organization that makes it possible
for competing manufacturers to meet in the same room and help
formulate standards and avoid antitrust problems.       Once the
standard is written, project principals are hoping for industry
acceptance, not a mandated standard.
           "[TIA has] offered help to assist them, but it is still
waiting for their response," Meyer said.  Jorgensen anticipates
that TIA will be brought in as early as mid-February, and he
called the participation of the association "critical" to the
success of the venture.

WARC CHALLENGE--FINDING SPECTRUM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES

           The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC)
challenge in 1992, said Bob Raish with the law firm Fletcher,
Heald and Hildreth, is to decide how to superimpose all the new
communications technology upon a spectrum that is totally
allocated.
           Raish, speaking at the recent forum, "WARC '92:
Allocations for the Year 2000 and Beyond," sponsored by the
Washington Annenburg Program, said the most critical focus will
be on the 1-3 GHz band where new technology requirements already
exist for a substantial portion
and where the "have or have not" confrontation is the greatest
due to industry interests.
           "There must be a balance between spectrum accommodation
and technological advancement," said Raish.  Raish also said the
United States faces a dilemma: whether it should keep up with
competition or remain entrenched.
           Travis Marshall, senior vice president and director of
government relations at Motorola, said the market should drive
allocations, not technology.
           "The mobile radio is an explosive growth area doubling
spectrum needs every 5 years," said Marshall.
           However, Michael Rau of the National Association for
Broadcasters (NAB) did not seem as optimistic about the effects
of WARC '92.  Rau said U.S. broadcasters do not need the WARC.
"The WARC issue concerns satellite-delivered high-definition
television (HDTV)," said Rau.  NAB does not believe HDTV is
needed in the United States.
           Rau also said that he did not feel the United States
should adopt a position that favors entrepreneurial technology,
especially if that technology duplicates existing services that
are meeting consumers needs.  "The U.S. should focus on pragmatic
policy rather than idealistic or theoretical frameworks," added
Rau.  Look for more coverage on the WARC forum in our next
issue.

           *The Association for Maximum Service Television Inc.
(MSTV) recently filed comments to the FCC addressing the proposal to
use the UHF band for the developing digital audio broadcasting (DAB)
service.  MSTV said "there is one clear certainty: advanced
television (ATV) and DAB cannot `share' the UHF television band."
MSTV said that industry has invested billions in the development of
ATV transmission systems and tens of millions in the development and
installation of testing and evaluation capabilities.  "It is now
certain that terrestrial ATV will require every last remaining piece
of the UHF band in major markets for years to come," said MSTV in its
filing.  Additionally, MSTV said that even if ATV's use of the UHF
band were not contemplated, sharing of the band with existing NTSC
stations "would be costly and impractical."  (The Association for

           *Nynex Corp. recently submitted its comments to the FCC
discussing the spectrum allocation requirements for personal
communication services (PCS).  Nynex said it agreed with the
commission in its view that an exclusive allocation for land
mobile services and specifically personal portable wireless
services is neither necessary nor appropriate.       "As recent
advances in the cellular industry demonstrate, technology and a
flexible regulatory approach can assist in making more efficient
use of existing spectrum to provide a range of quality services
such as personal communication services," said Nynex in its
comments.  Nynex also said the deployment of a technology that
permits the sharing of frequencies is "a more practical and
viable approach to the development of new wireless service
offerings" than the WARC proposal.  The WARC proposal would
require the reallocation of frequencies on an exclusive basis.
Nynex has applied to the FCC for an experimental license to test
the feasibility of sharing spectrum in the 1850-1990 MHz range

techniques.  (Nynex Corp., 1113 West Chester Ave., White Plains,

HUGHES NETWORK SYSTEMS SUPPORTS THE NEW TDMA TECHNOLOGY

           Hughes Network Systems (HNS) recently announced that it
will manufacture cellular telephones using the radical new TDMA-
compatible technology, Extended Time Division Multiple Access (E-
TDMA) technology, which is promising 15 times analog capacity,
from International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMM).
           HNS will create a nationwide cellular services network,
offering customers one-stop shopping for cellular phones at
General Motors dealers.  The company, owned by GM Hughes
Electronics, will offer dual-mode phones, switches and cell site
equipment on a turnkey basis to carriers.  HNS will supply the
switches through a long-term agreement with France-based Alcatel.
           "Everyone is vigorously trying to update the technology
and increase  spectrum efficiency," said Robert Wysor,
consultant, Economic & Management Consultants Inc. (EMCI).  "In
the long run, that is very good for the industry."

A `Voice Activated Channel' Will Employ Unused Channel Capacity

           E-TDMA achieves 15 times analog capacity versus 3 times
analog, which is the current TDMA expectation, by using digital
speech interpolation (DSI).  This technique assigns the channel
only when the person is speaking.  In other words, time slots are
only assigned during actual talk time.  In any 2-way
communication, 65% of the channel capacity goes unused, because
while one person speaks the other channel remains silent.  IMM's
answer to the dilemma of accessing that unused capacity could be
called a "voice-activated channel."
           "The Hughes proposal will only assign a channel to
someone when they are speaking," said George Calhoun, IMM senior
vice president.  "So when they are not speaking, they don't take
up any part of [the] channel."
           In the existing TDMA technology, a user receives a
periodic time slot whether he is speaking or not, and silence is
broadcast to the one who is talking.  E-TDMA takes advantage of
the silent time slots.

Hughes' Phones Will be Compatible with Current Standard

           The Hughes dual-mode phones will be compatible with the
industry standard.  "It uses the same slot structure [6-slots],
same channel structure, same 30 KHz bandwidth, as in IS-54.  It
fits within that framework without any modification.  It uses the
slots for different purposes, and some of the control information
is different but it is allowed by the standard," Calhoun said.
           "IS-54 provides the framework in which other things can
be implemented, but it's certainly not the end of the line.  The
belief that CDMA was 20 times and TDMA was 3 times was simply
wrong," said Calhoun.

Universal Service, Federal Preemption Are Focus Of NCSL Meeting

     State and local governments should monitor provisions in
pending federal telecommunications legislation that could preempt
their authority over carriers within their jurisdictions, panelists
told the National Conference of State Legislatures  during a
meeting of the group's Assembly on Federal Issues held last month
in Washington.  Speakers also discussed whether definitions of
universal service should embrace "advanced" telecom services,
including Internet access.

     In a hearing held by NCSL's Agriculture and Trade Committee,
Clayton Parker, Director-intergovernmental affairs in the Office of
U.S. Trade Representative, said the U.S. is prepared to "freeze"
state-level telecom regulations at their current level as part of
the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations over
basic telecom services.  

     The offer to freeze state regulation is contingent on U.S.
trading partners' agreeing to liberalize their own markets. 
Meanwhile, the federal government would have to obtain consensus on
the proposal from the states, Mr. Parker said.  He noted that
passage of federal telecom legislation would render the offer moot.

     At a Commerce and Communications Committee hearing, Debra
Berlyn, Executive Director of the National Association of State
Utility Consumer Advocates, told state legislators that "effective
competition will protect ratepayers and offer them more benefits
than regulation" will.  But deregulation without effective
competition is "the worst of all possible worlds" for ratepayers,
she added.  

     State legislators should "look in their own backyards" to find
the "most interesting, innovative" developments in telecom markets,
said Jamie Cooper, Associate Director of the Center for Policy
Alternatives in Washington.  In conjunction with the Benton
Foundation, the center this month is issuing a progress report
detailing what states are doing to develop telecom infrastructure,
promote uses of new technology, and encourage innovation, Ms.
Cooper said.

     Jeffrey A. Chester, Executive Director of the Washington-based
Center for Media Education, said universal service should include
access to personal computers and online services, he said.  

     "Electronic redlining"--the exclusion of low-income areas when
deploying advanced services--is a real concern for CME.  Privacy is
another concern, and it is an issue "that the feds are not going to
deal with," Mr. Chester added.  Scott Cooper,
Manager-telecommunications policy for Intel Corp., said, "People
need more bandwidth than they can get over analog copper wire."

     But Mary Rouleau, Director-state legislation for the American
Association of Retired Persons, urged legislators to look at claims
that investment in network upgrades are "demand-driven."  She
suggested that such upgrades are being made "on spec" and that
ratepayers--who may not want advanced services--will have to pay
for them.  Richard L. Cimerman, Director-state telecommunications
association affairs for the National Cable Television Association,
echoed that concern.  He said proposals to include broadband
offerings in the definition of universal service will amount to a
$78 million "tax" on ratepayers.

     The National Governors' Association wants Congress to ensure
that federal legislation will not affect any state rules on
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll presubscription
that already are in effect, said Tim Masanz, NGA's Group
Director-economic development and commerce.  He noted that four
states--Arizona, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania--
either recently have acted, or are about to act, on this issue.

     Kevin McCarty, Assistant Executive Director-energy,
transportation, and communications for the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, said the federal legislative debate "has created the idea
that there is something special" about telecom service providers as
occupants of public rights-of-way.  Under the competitive market
model, "we will be retrofitting public thoroughfares" to an extent
never before seen, allowing new market entrants use of those
rights-of-way, he said.  Companies are going to Congress and asking
for the same free use of public rights-of-way that was given to
telcos "a hundred years ago," he added.

     Mary McDermott, Vice President-regulatory affairs for the U.S.
Telephone Association, argued that while competition should replace
regulation as the "paradigm" for the industry, it is important to
ensure universal service.  "In many places competition can ensure
affordable service, but not everywhere," she added.  

     Language in the pending federal legislation should be
clarified to ensure that states retain jurisdiction over intrastate
universal service funds, said Lee Palagyi, an Ohio Public Utilities
Commission staff member representing the views of the National
Association of State Utility Regulators.

     Bob Fogel, Assistant Legislative Director of the National
Association of Counties, said local government representatives are
"pretty close" to an agreement with the wireless industry on zoning
authority for cellular and personal communications service (PCS)
towers.  

     Nicholas W. Allard, Counsel to the Wireless Cable Association
International, suggested that state and local governments
increasingly are viewing telecom service providers as a source of
revenue.  He warned that new taxes can be "duplicative" of existing
ones, saying, "Whenever you hear the phrase 'level the playing
field,' you should hold on to something, because you're about to be
tilted over."

MCI Asks N.Y. PSC for 'Neutral' USF, Wants NYNEX Price Plan Set
Aside

     Attacking NYNEX-New York on two fronts, MCI Telecommunications
Corp. has asked the New York Public Service Commission to
reconsider whether the telephone company needs a universal service
subsidy and has requested that a state court overturn the PSC's
approval of NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan.  MCI
submitted to the PSC data from a universal service cost study it
said showed that NYNEX's residential local exchange revenues are
more than two times the economic costs it incurs to provide basic
local exchange service.

     NYNEX's annual revenues from residential services amount to
$1.6 billion, but its total costs to provide those services equal
$640 million, MCI said.  The study indicated that a "limited"
universal service fund of about $10 million per year "is needed to
allow local competition to develop in the high-cost areas" of
NYNEX's service territory.  MCI asked the PSC to develop a
"competitively neutral mechanism to collect and distribute
universal service subsidies where they are truly needed."

     The universal service cost study "confirms what MCI has long
maintained:  NYNEX overcharges its own customers and long distance
companies, does not need a subsidy to deliver basic local service
at affordable rates, and uses those excessive revenues, in part, to
support its other competitive ventures as well as to realize
excessive profit," said Donna Sorgi, Director-state regulatory and
government affairs for MCI's Eastern Region.

     The study found the average cost of service in New York City
to be $7 per residential customer, while NYNEX receives an average
of $26.85 in revenues per customer, MCI said.  Meanwhile, in some
rural areas--particularly in upstate New York--the cost of service
may be as high as $40 per month, while revenues "may only be around
$16 per month."  Those are areas that "actually need" a universal
service subsidy, MCI said.

     MCI's research undercuts NYNEX's reasoning that "enormous
overcharges for access fees" are needed to provide subsidies for
universal service, MCI argued.  According to a chart released by
MCI, NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan allows it to charge
5.6 cents per minute for intrastate access to its network, while
its "economic cost" to provide that service is 1 cent per minute
(see chart).  

     In its Dec. 18 filing with the commission, MCI also submitted
the "Benchmark Cost Model" it developed in conjunction with NYNEX,
Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc.  That model was filed in an FCC
proceeding on revising universal service support programs (SLCR,
Oct. 20, 1995).  The model "produces 'benchmark' costs for the
provision of basic telephone service in each census block group
within a state," MCI told the PSC.

     Applying the model to New York yields a statewide average cost
for basic universal service of $12.02 per month, compared with a
nationwide average of $16.71 per month, MCI reported.

     MCI also sought a suspension of "the 'play or pay'
intercarrier compensation rates currently in effect in [NYNEX's]
Tariff No. 914."  It added, "There is no factual basis to support
the commission's arbitrary classification of local exchange
competitors as either 'players' or 'payers,' based upon the
untested and unproven assumption that residential service requires
a subsidy from other services."  MCI asked the commission to reopen
an earlier stage of its proceeding on universal service and the
transition to competitive local exchange markets.

MCI Asks Court To Reject NYNEX Regulatory Plan

     On Dec. 18 MCI asked the New York State Supreme Court (County
of Albany) to set aside portions of the PSC's order in "Track 2" of
its incentive regulation proceeding (case no. 92-C-0665), in which
the PSC had approved NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan. 
MCI alleged that the commissioners had reached their decision on
the plan "in private session in violation of the Open Meetings
Law."

     MCI also asked the court to set aside those portions of the
commission's "Track 1" order in the same proceeding that allowed
NYNEX to "continue to collect $153.3 million in revenues in excess
of its annual revenue requirement"--the revenue required to recoup
its costs and provide a "reasonable return" to investors.  The PSC
had ordered NYNEX to "set aside" those funds "to be used in
accordance with commission determinations to be made in the future
to fund incentives for [NYNEX] to improve its performance," MCI
told the court.  All but $27 million of the set-aside funds have
been released to NYNEX as service-quality incentive awards, it
added.  The price targets the PSC set for certain services were
"based on a wholly untested and unproven assumption that local
residential service requires a subsidy from those services," MCI
said.

     A NYNEX spokesman said MCI is making "the same tired, old,
muddled argument that is as inaccurate today as it was" two years
ago, when work on NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan began. 
"MCI is simply looking for an access rate reduction that is deeper
than it got under the plan," which took effect in September, he
said.  The plan "strikes a good balance" between competitors,
NYNEX, the state, and consumers, who will see about $2 billion in
local exchange and toll rate reductions over seven years, he added.

Utilities Share Problems of State, Local Agencies in Relocating
from 2 GHz Band

By M.J. Richter

     Like many state and local government agencies, numerous member
companies of UTC (formerly known as the Utilities
Telecommunications Council) are incumbent licensees in the 2
gigahertz microwave band.  Also like state and local government
entities, these investor-owned and publicly owned utilities,
electric cooperatives, municipal utility departments, and natural
gas pipeline companies traditionally have used their 2 GHz
microwave radio systems for their internal operations, rather than
for revenue-producing services.  In a recent interview with SLCR,
UTC staff attorney Thomas Goode explained how the FCC's decision to
reallocate the 2 GHz spectrum to personal communications service
(PCS) operators is affecting many of the association's nearly 2,000
member companies. 

     SLCR:  What does the FCC's decision mean for the day-to-day
operations of UTC member companies, which rely heavily on their 2
GHz microwave radio systems for internal communications?

     Goode:  The microwave systems that they now operate in the 2
GHz bands have not been replaced for some period of time, because
UTC member companies have been waiting for resolution of the status
of this particular band, to see whether it would be reclassified
for use by the PCS licensees.  There's been a lot of uncertainty
about what the rules would be, how long they would have to move
out, whether they'd have to bear the cost themselves.  So there
hasn't been as much activity as there probably normally would have
been concerning the replacement of analog systems with digital
systems.

     There has been some movement from the band, simply to get out
of that [uncertain] situation and get to another band--the 6 GHz
band, for instance.

     There are some that have waited, and now they're in a position
where they are co-primary in the bands, which means they can stay
there forever, at least according to current FCC rules.  But they
have to deal with the issue of involuntary relocation at the hands
of PCS licensees.

     SLCR:  If they're co-primary and therefore can stay forever if
they want to, what if a PCS licensee wants the bands they're on?

     Goode:  Essentially, the way the rules work now, the PCS
licensee can operate on the band to the extent that he does not
interfere with an incumbent licensee.  And they are co-primary with
the incumbent licensee.  Now, if the PCS licensees are unable to
operate without causing interference to an incumbent licensee, or
do not want to deal with the hassle of having to work around the
incumbent system, they can enter into mandatory negotiations--force
the incumbent to come to the table and discuss the relocation
terms.

     If they cannot come to a mutually agreeable resolution or
relocation agreement, the PCS licensees can force the incumbent
out.  They can go to the FCC and request an involuntary relocation
of an incumbent system.  

     If they do that, they have to pay all costs associated with
the relocation; they have to move the incumbent to another band;
they have to make sure that the facilities they give them are
comparable to what the incumbent had in the 2 GHz bands; they have
to guarantee that the replacement is seamless, that this whole
transition process out of the 2 GHz band does not disrupt the
incumbent's. . .communications.

     SLCR:  To date, have any UTC members that are incumbent
licensees of that spectrum successfully negotiated their relocation
with PCS providers?

     Goode:  Yes, a number have.  [The negotiated terms and
conditions] are subject in most cases to a nondisclosure agreement. 
I could definitely say, however, that a number of successful
negotiations have occurred--and are occurring right now.  Not only
have they done it but, from what we've heard from the industry,
both sides have been very happy with what they've gotten out of
some of these agreements.

     SLCR:  Are they attempting to negotiate whole-system
changeouts, or are UTC members making piecemeal arrangements with
multiple PCS licensees?

     Goode:  Both.  The answer to that question depends on the
incumbents, what their systems are like and what they're looking
for out of this whole transition process.  Some incumbent systems
are structured such that they cannot tolerate a piecemeal
relocation.  Every time you relocate a single link, you have a
potential for disrupting the entire system.  Some of these systems
are providing such vital communications under. . .such unique
technical constraints that they need to be relocated entirely at
one time, a whole-system changeout.

     Others are looking simply to relocate certain links, and their
systems either are more robust or they're able to somehow engineer
around [any problems].  I know that both [types of relocation] are
happening.

     SLCR:  What do UTC members think of the FCC's proposed
$400,000 cap on the recovery by PCS licensees of the costs they
incur in relocating incumbent users, e.g., UTC members?

     Goode:  Our members are very concerned about this $400,000 cap
because the incumbent microwave systems are unique.  There is no
easy way to quantify how much it would take to move a [given]
system.   Without analyzing each individual system, the costs are
going to vary greatly from one system to another. . .

     When you put a cap on reimbursement costs, even though it
doesn't directly affect how much money can be paid to an incumbent-
-because the cap is only on what the PCS provider can seek from
other PCS providers--there is going to be a fairly direct causal
relationship between that cap and how much a licensee will pay to
relocate a link.  [PCS licensees] will be cognizant of the fact
that they only get reimbursed up to a certain amount, and they're
going to be pushing to keep the amount of money that they pay under
that.

     SLCR:  How are incumbent UTC licensees determining the
market-based value of their microwave operations?

     Goode:  I think the main focus has not been on the fair-market
value, as much as on the replacement value.  Basically, when
incumbents are in negotiations with a PCS provider, they're looking
at two different elements of the costs--or the value--of the
replacement.  One, they're looking at the replacement facilities: 
Where do they need to go?  What will that facility look like?  What
are the costs associated with moving, for instance, from a 2 GHz
system to a 6 GHz system--hardware, software, labor charges, all
the elements that are built into the replacement?  The other
element is the value [or price] that a PCS licensee is willing to
pay to get up and running more quickly than it otherwise might. 
And that is something that requires an analysis of what the value
of time is to a PCS licensee.

     SLCR:  At this point in the negotiation/relocation process, do
UTC members believe the FCC's two-year transition period for
"voluntary negotiations" is long enough?

     Goode:  I would guess that most members are happy with that
period, because they are guaranteed a one-year mandatory period, so
they can negotiate after that.  This voluntary negotiation period
gives them a time to prepare for this negotiation, to do the
studies and whatnot, to be in a position that when they are
required--if they ever are required to negotiate during the
mandatory period--they will have the necessary information.

     This two-year voluntary period is fixed, and the mandatory
period is not.  The mandatory period is a one-year period, but it
doesn't start until the incumbent receives a written notification
from the PCS licensee that they want to negotiate.  

     SLCR:  Do UTC members believe that voluntary negotiations
between the PCS industry and incumbent 2 GHz users will be
successful, or do they think the FCC will have "to impose" some
relocation agreements?

     Goode:  I think most members have very positive feelings that
they will be successful in negotiating a relocation agreement and
that they will reach a voluntary agreement without having to be
forced out of the band.  

     There's a lot of optimism that if a reasonable offer is made,
they can and will try not only to meet the needs/wishes of the PCS
licensee in relocating from the band, but also to offer other
services, such as certain infrastructure--dark fiber, cell sites,
other types of services that will further the PCS deployment.  I
think there's a lot of optimism among our members that it will end
up being a win-win situation for both parties.

APC, Maryland Agency Face PCS Interference Questions

     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that its
personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering with
the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recent
letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) stated
that the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" to
the communications operations of light rail and bus services
operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.  

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressed
concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" the
effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands. 
The FCC recently clarified rules governing relocation efforts,
further defining "good faith" negotiations between licensees.

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. 
The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred as
a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment further on the interference problems, noting
that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Ms. Schelle told SLCR that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.  The MTA received at least six such letters
indicating that APC planned to test its PCS system, he said, but
MTA officials failed to respond to a single one.

     "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are informed
of the complete parameters of those facilities' operations.  APC
fully protected the facilities represented on MTA's FCC license and
could not have known, without being informed by MTA, that MTA is
operating at a variance from those parameters."

Cable TV Interests Sue Chicago Over 7% 'Amusement Tax'

     The cable TV industry has followed through on threats to sue
Chicago over a 7% "amusement tax" to be applied to the gross
receipts of companies offering video services and certain forms of
live entertainment (SLCR, Dec. 1, 1995).  As previously reported,
the Chicago City Council adopted an ordinance imposing the tax
effective Jan. 1.  Cable TV companies oppose the amusement tax
because they already pay local franchise fees, and satellite TV
operators oppose it because they have no "local" facilities. 
Companies in both industries fear that other cities may impose
similar taxes.

     Communications and Cable of Chicago, Inc., LaSalle
Telecommunications, Inc., and South Chicago Cable, Inc.
(collectively Chicago Cable TV) and the Cable Television and
Communications Association of Illinois have filed a joint lawsuit
(case no. 95CH0011919) against the city of Chicago in the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Ill.  In a memorandum supporting their
"motion for preliminary injunction," the plaintiffs argued that the
newly adopted amusement tax "singles out" cable TV operators and
other providers of electronically delivered programming.  But they
noted that it does not tax "the broadcast television industry and
other members of the press and print media that deliver" similar
programming to Chicago residents.

     Seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, they
said application of the amusement tax "upon selected modes of
speech violates the equal protection clauses of the United States
and Illinois constitutions, as well as the First Amendment rights
of [the] plaintiffs and their subscribers."  In a statement, they
expressed concern that imposing a tax on the estimated 33% of
Chicago residents who subscribe to cable TV service "places a
disproportionate and unfair burden on them to fund services that
benefit the city's entire population."  They recommended that
Chicago undertake further research on the issue before establishing
tax precedents "that potentially could cover everything from online
computer services to home shopping to hotel movie systems."

Pennsylvania Cable TV-Led Coalition's FiberSpan Concept Hasn't Been
Realized

By Judith Freeman Mills

     A year after a communications industry coalition--dominated by
cable TV concerns--acquired the rights to the FiberSpan
Pennsylvania broadband infrastructure concept from the Pennsylvania
Cable TV Association, the project seems all but dead.  The plan to
offer an array of  21st century telecom services in Pennsylvania by
interconnecting the state's cable TV systems "is not going forward
as originally planned," said Hal Estelle, FiberSpan's former Chief
Operating Officer and now a consultant to the project.  Although
the concept is changing, it "still exists," he emphasized.

     The FiberSpan project was created by the state cable TV
association in response to proposals--including legislative
initiatives--for a statewide, fiber optic distance-learning and
telemedicine network.  The proposed legislation would have mandated
telephone company investments in such a network.  The telcos
estimated it would cost them $20 billion to $30 billion to build
the network.  [Legislation was passed in 1993 that allows the
state's telcos to adopt alternative regulation if they submit plans
to the Public Utility Commission for implementing a broadband
network by the year 2015.--Ed.]

     The original goal for FiberSpan was to link all cable headends
in Pennsylvania using fiber optic cables, augmented as needed with
microwave, satellite, and coaxial connections to ensure universal
access to the infrastructure.  The network would offer broadband
delivery of two-way video, data, and voice communications to
government buildings, schools, businesses, medical facilities, and
homes.  But the idea, seemingly simple in concept and technology,
proved more complicated when it came to economics and politics.

     After conducting research and development for the FiberSpan
concept, the state cable TV association sold its idea on Jan. 3,
1995, to the industry coalition, which includes a few phone
companies and energy utilities, as well as cable TV companies. 
FiberSpan Pennsylvania was transformed into a for-profit
corporation.  Jones Lightwave, a competitive access provider and
subsidiary of multiple system operator (MSO) Jones International
Ltd., was one of about 20 major equity investors.  Lightwave
President Wallace Griffen served as Chairman of the FiberSpan
board.

     Earlier this year a contract was drafted--but never signed--
for Jones Lightwave to build and manage the FiberSpan project.  For
the past several months FiberSpan officials have said a final
contract would be issued soon.  But last week they made no such
pronouncement.  While Mr. Estelle said the parties were discussing
a modified version of the FiberSpan Pennsylvania idea, other
project officials were more blunt, saying the idea would never
become a reality.

     "We are looking toward a possibility [that] FiberSpan will
play a role" in the infrastructure of Pennsylvania, Mr. Estelle
said.  "There is still an interest in developing
larger-than-regional infrastructures" and also in serving the
entire state "in some form or fashion."  Talks are continuing
"within the general framework" of the original idea, he continued.

     But he explained that there have been problems getting
FiberSpan's investors to agree on "how to set up the corporation
and the management structure."  In addition, he said, there have
been questions about "the changing nature of competition, changing
attitudes" and, significantly, "individual company plans for their
own regional networks."

     Asked if too many companies are involved in FiberSpan, Mr.
Estelle said, "You can't discount that."  But the number of
participants was not the core problem, he said, adding:  "It would
be more helpful if there was a more defined policy" from the state
government regarding statewide video, telephony, and data
communications.

     William Cologie, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Cable TV
Association, suggested that smaller independent cable operators
felt "a reluctance to relinquish control."  But despite the failure
of FiberSpan's participants to agree on the details of the planned
broadband infrastructure, the idea is still valid, he maintained. 
The idea "makes sense for companies such as Lenfest Communications
and Tele-Communications, Inc., that are rapidly consolidating" and
interconnecting their Pennsylvania operations, he added.  "Why
wouldn't it make sense for the independent operators to jump on,
too, he asked?"

     In the race to wire the state with two-way multimedia-capable
fiber optic lines, the FiberSpan participants still have "a couple
years' head start in terms of infrastructure" compared to Bell
Atlantic-Pennsylvania, the Bell operating company that serves much
of the state, Mr. Cologie said.  The cable TV association is not
considering taking on the FiberSpan effort again, he noted.

     Mr. Griffen said he remains on FiberSpan's board and is "still
hopeful" that an infrastructure based on the FiberSpan concept will
become a reality.  But he noted that cable TV companies, including
Jones, are finding their timetables for launching high-speed data,
telephony, and interactive video services to be more protracted
than originally expected.  The time spent on FiberSpan was not
wasted, because it benefited related projects being undertaken at
Jones, he said.

Regulators, Communications Industry Concerned about Transition
Ahead

By Victoria Mason, Editor of  SLCR's sister publication,
Telecommunications Reports

     Attempts to craft federal legislation reforming the 1934
Communications Act are having dramatic effects on all segments of
the communications industry, even before a bill is signed into law. 
The transition to a new industry structure already is in full
swing, and while the legislation will codify new competitive
principles and regulatory roles, in many respects it may be
outdated from the beginning.

     Instead of driving the current changes shaking the
communications world, activities on Capitol Hill are only
responding to the unique combination of technological, economic,
social, and political forces that have been shaping the industry's
future for some time.  But now, the pace has quickened.

     Participants at a recent conference sponsored by the KMB Video
Journal kept repeating the views of one panelist:  "The current
exercise may be irrelevant--a little bit like rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic."  The communications markets are in the
process of reorganizing themselves in fundamental ways.  What
Congress, a regulatory agency, or any company or industry segment
does at this point is likely to influence only the details.

     The legislative developments, however, are focusing greater
public attention on an industry that accounts for a major portion
of the nation's economy and that will have profound effects on how
Americans work and play, become educated, and receive health care
in the 21st century.  And for regulators and business executives,
the congressional debates have served as a "wake-up call":  There's
little time left for the perennial arguments about what the
industry should look like in the future, whether one businesses'
"level playing field" gives it advantages, and how to carve up a
market that is growing exponentially.

     Some regulators and industry executives are acknowledging that
the telecom world is moving in an irreversible direction--with or
without their blessings.  This is creating uneasiness in all
quarters.  Regulators are trying to redefine their roles for the
short term, and many wonder whether they'll have a long-term role. 
Business people are dreading the difficult decisions that come with
corporate reorganizing and downsizing, the never-ending demands for
greater efficiencies, and the industry's push into uncharted
territory.

     In discussions between industry officials and regulators, a
shift is occurring:  The focus is on the stark realities of change-
-the opportunities and problems it brings.  Quickly emerging is a
competitive industry structure in which carrier classifications
will be blurred or eliminated, and market entry and exit barriers
will fall.  Companies that historically have been defined by a
narrow set of products or services--and that have honored
franchises and carefully delineated service territories--are being
turned loose to move in any direction their managers choose.  Bell
companies and independent telcos will compete against each other;
interexchange carriers, competitive access providers, wireless
service providers, and global competitors also will be thrown into
the mix.

     What is being called "regulatory schizophrenia"--having an
announced U.S. policy favoring competition and open market entry,
while simultaneously favoring the preservation of universal service
at all cost--will have to be corrected.  But how?  It's clear that
a new blueprint is urgently needed, but government and business
leaders first must decide what they want the outcome to be.

The Legislation:  What It Does, What It Doesn't Do

     While most observers expect President Clinton to sign
legislation developed by the House-Senate conference committee,
they note that repeated attempts to revise the Communications Act
have failed over the years, often at the last minute.  Each time,
surprised industry lobbyists and Capitol Hill staffers have wailed,
"We were so close, and so much effort went into the process this
time around."

     History proves the Washington adage that it's always easier to
kill a piece of legislation than to get one signed into law.  The
current House and Senate bills, HR 1555 and S 652, are among the
most complex, far-reaching measures to be debated on Capitol Hill
in recent times.  In addition to updating the telephone and
broadcasting sections of the 1934 statute, they address industries
and economic sectors that didn't exist until relatively recently. 
Because the bills tackle so many issues--they "try to do everything
to and for everybody," one lobbyist says--the opportunities for
"mischief-making" are great.

     The direction of the broadly defined "communications industry"
is clear, however, and a massive industry restructuring will
continue to proceed with or without this specific legislation.  If
the current legislative attempt fails, all participants in the
process will be back later--as they have year after year for the
past two decades.

     U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, who has had the
unenviable task of overseeing the 1982 antitrust consent decree
that bans the Bell companies from interLATA (local access and
transport area) markets and manufacturing, has been awaiting the
outcome of the legislative debate.  

     Several important requests for decree waivers are pending
before him--waivers that would allow local exchange/interexchange
competition experiments.  If communications legislation is not
signed into law, Judge Greene will move on those motions.

     Another "wild card" concerns the Bell companies' 1994 request
that the decree be vacated.  Judge Greene gave the Justice
Department one year to investigate the request, and its
recommendation was expected to be submitted early last September. 
The department's views still are awaited.  Its response is expected
to focus on the current state of competition in communications
markets, possibly fueling the fires on Capitol Hill.

     The current legislative debate, which has been more visible in
the national and local press than have past attempts to rewrite
national telecom policies, has highlighted the trend toward a
competitive model in all segments of communications.  It also has
eradicated age-old concepts about business segmentation and lines
of demarcation (i.e., company X is in the "telephone business,"
company Y is in the "entertainment business," and so on).

     How to define the markets of tomorrow is troublesome for the
Clinton administration, federal legislators, and state regulators. 
Because the bills outline an incremental approach to change that
already is occurring in many jurisdictions, they may be considered
"evolutionary" instead of "revolutionary."  The result will be
greater reliance on market forces and new types of involvement by
regulators.

     Regulators and the financial community have become aware that
even minor tinkering with this industry can have enormous ripple
effects throughout the nation's economy and social structure. 
Indeed, global effects are of concern.  The bills, which spell out
a national policy framework, seek to open communications markets to
more participants and to encourage the deployment of new
technologies and services.

     People involved in all sides of the debate believe that a
rewrite of the nation's communications statute must ensure that all
Americans have access to "new technologies" in addition to basic
telephony.  By the year 2000, 60% of new jobs will require skills
that only 20% of Americans have today.  The Clinton administration
says that, to ensure an adequately trained workforce, educational
institutions and libraries must have adequate access to the
national information infrastructure.

Technology:  Another Complicating Factor

     Overlaid on the political disputes is a shifting technology
scene that promises both solutions and more problems.  The
following technology trends point to major societal changes over
the next 10 years:

     *    Mobility:  People want the flexibility offered by mobile
communications.  This market demand eventually will allow wireless
and wireline services to achieve price and service-quality parity. 
Integrated networks offering seamless services and number
portability will circle the globe.  Separate voice and data lines,
fax lines, mobile phone equipment, and the like will become
unnecessary as single devices provide "integrated messaging."

     *    The Internet:  An increasing number of people pay $15 to
$20 per month for access to the Internet; some of them stay
connected for hours on end, while others have access for short
periods.  As the Internet becomes more popular, traffic congestion
and network crowding will become problems for network planners. 
And capabilities for voice telephony over the Internet will allow
"free" long distance calling, a situation interexchange carriers
can't do anything about.

     The rapid growth of Internet usage raises security issues and
has implications for a variety of transaction services targeted to
both consumers and businesses.  The Internet also will spawn new
"cottage industries," as in-home provision of information and other
services becomes lucrative.  Meanwhile, electronic commerce over
the Internet will lead to "disintermediation"--the elimination of
arbitrage or middlemen--in major segments of the economy.  On a
social level, Internet "chat groups" will allow the real-time
sharing of experiences without regard to geography (i.e., "virtual
parties" while a football game is in progress).

     *    Home Entertainment/Video:  This will develop as
asymmetric digital subscriber line technology evolves and broadband
networks are upgraded.  Predictions are that by the year 2005, two
fully robust networks--cable TV and telephony--will be capable of
delivering all types of services to the home.  

     "Intelligent agents" will find the information a consumer
wants, sorting and filtering massive amounts of data available on
numerous networks.  And "virtual reality" technologies will be
simplified for general consumer uses (for real estate shopping,
home decorating, or product testing, for example).  Telcos,
meanwhile, are expected to integrate vertically into the "content"
business.

     *    Deployment Speed:  Faster product life cycles will mean
faster changes in industry structures, business relationships, and
corporate leadership.

     These changes mean that policy-makers cannot continue drawing
those "bright red lines" around services and industry segments. 
Attempts to delineate which companies can get involved in which
services, and whether services are basic/enhanced or
regulated/unregulated will fail.  As LATA boundaries, franchise
areas, and other types of artificial geographic segmentation become
obsolete, rules will be applied to companies irrespective of the
specific technologies they employ.

How Regulators View the Transition

     Communications markets of tomorrow will be cost-driven,
market-driven, technology-driven, and customer-driven.  Although
aspects of the current regulatory system will remain during the
transition, there's a growing acknowledgment that regulation and
competition cannot coexist indefinitely.

     Meanwhile, the "Internet revolution" is causing many observers
to question the relevance of regulation at all, in any form.  What
the Internet and online services enable massive numbers of people
to do on a global basis also has serious implications for state and
national laws and borders.  These developments are external to the
narrowly focused U.S. debate about reorganizing portions of the
domestic communications industry.

     Regulatory agencies have existed for more than 100 years,
however.  During that time policy-makers have observed great
changes in technology and the business environment, emerging each
time with an updated list of responsibilities and a renewed mission
statement.  The changes ahead will be just as profound for
regulators as for the business community.  

     Nevertheless, some regulation is likely to continue as complex
new issues emerge (carrier and network interconnection is surfacing
as the next battlefield).  And states will retain an important role
as laboratories for regulatory and marketplace experiments.

     But regulators are worried.  They fear the political and
social problems that would result if the current disparities in
wealth and education are extended to communications, creating a
society of information "haves" and "have nots."  

     They wonder what is being done for--or to--consumers who don't
care about competitive models and only want affordable basic
telephone service.  Regulators are hoping for creative solutions.

     State regulators disagree about the effects of Communications
Act revision and the role of regulation in the future.  Some view
federal developments positively, believing that consumers, the
economy, and the nation's global competitiveness will benefit if
legislation is enacted.  They note that local exchange competition
initiatives already are forcing states to review how industries are
regulated.  Events in Washington, they say, are only formalizing a
process that's well under way.

     Others, however, worry that authority is being taken from
them, that their relationships with consumers and industry
officials and their understanding of local needs are being ignored,
and that federal preemption will disrupt activities progressing in
the states.  They want flexibility to address competition issues in
ways that reflect local conditions.  And, believing that rate
increases are inevitable, they want safeguards against "rate shock"
in areas that currently have extremely low rates.

     While national communications policy reforms definitely are
needed, the pendulum has swung too far toward an "inside the
Beltway" approach, some state representatives say.  Economic
development programs may be at stake:  A state needs the freedom to
adopt policies encouraging businesses to locate within its borders. 
If a state makes the right decisions, it will prosper economically. 
If it makes the wrong decisions, it will suffer the consequences. 
Regulators fear that detailed federal mandates will have a
"leveling" effect, making it difficult for individual state
economic development policies to be carried out.

     In some states, many consumer complaints involve interstate
matters over which the states have no jurisdiction.  Because
consumers generally believe federal authorities are inaccessible
and slow to act, they sometimes feel there has been no resolution
to their problems.  

     This situation has led to a suggestion that state public
service commissions become FCC "field offices" after federal
legislation is enacted.  Under this scenario, states would remain
closely involved at the local level, functioning as the federal
government's eyes and ears and having power to act on the federal
government's behalf.

     Also under review is whether the old common law concept of
"common carriage" can be sustained in a competitive environment. 
Public utilities historically have been viewed as "natural
monopolies," with economies of scope and scale that allowed one
company to serve the public interest more efficiently (cheaper)
than several could.  They provided "essential" services in a
nondiscriminatory fashion, and regulators protected the monopoly
status.  

     Regulators now are wondering if, in a competitive market, it
makes sense to characterize any communications company as a common
carrier.  The obligations imposed on public utilities can be
problematic when new market entrants don't appear to be "essential"
and all market players demand equitable treatment.

     Others believe common carriage concepts will remain because of
the public benefits flowing from them and the privileges enjoyed by
such carriers:  Carrier-customer contracts can be established
cheaply and easily through generic tariffs; common carriers have
easy access to public rights-of-way; and they have advantages when
legal liabilities are concerned.

     Regulatory roles and tools already are being revised to
address new demands, and further changes are ahead.  Regulators and
legislators must ensure that "quick fixes" so common during
transitions aren't relied upon long term.  "Sunset" provisions,
therefore, may be necessary to signal to all parties that the
search for permanent solutions should continue.

     Regulation historically has been "vertical," concentrating on
the relationship between carriers and their customers.  In the
future it will become more "horizontal," focusing on relationships
between carriers.  

     Instead of overseeing carrier rate bases or prices or
accounting practices, state regulators will be in charge of
certifying carriers and defining their obligations; addressing
local market entry/exit barriers; developing criteria for
"effective competition" in discrete markets; guaranteeing service
quality; making sure carriers adhere to certain technical
standards; guarding against discrimination between customers and
against competitors; protecting proprietary information about
customers; mediating in carrier-carrier and carrier-customer
disputes, which are expected to increase; and addressing consumer
protection issues and complaints.

     Consumer education and protection raise special concerns for
regulators, who are divided on questions concerning their future
role in these areas.  But everyone seems to agree that (1) consumer
education about communications issues has been handled very poorly
in the past, and (2) customer confusion will increase with the
advent of local exchange competition.  Regulators now wonder how
consumers will react if competition causes residential rates to go
up and business rates to drop.  How will the situation be explained
to them?  Who should take the lead in educating consumers about the
new industry structure?  And how are consumers to distinguish
between one company and another, between one service package and
another?

     Along with the choices available in competitive markets comes
consumer responsibility for the outcome.  Some regulators,
therefore, believe consumers should rely on government intervention
only in cases of fraud or other criminal conduct.  But in the
communications industry, shifting to a "let the buyer beware"
mindset may be slow in coming:  The industry structure is complex,
and many consumers are uncomfortable with technology. 
Nevertheless, in the future they may have to send
communications-related complaints to state attorneys general or the
courts.  Regulators, meanwhile, may target more resources to
collecting data that consumers need to make informed decisions
about communications services.

     Negotiated rulemaking and alternative dispute resolution
procedures are being explored widely, and their use in other
industries can be instructive for communications policy-makers. 
Crucial to successful use of these techniques are incentives for
industry participants to resolve differences themselves and firm
signals about the consequences if negotiations fail.  If regulatory
commissions become facilitators and arbitrators, they will need
employees trained in dispute-resolution procedures.

     The highly charged subject of staffing will be difficult for
commissions that in the future seek new types of employees--those
with backgrounds that are new to regulatory agencies (marketing,
for example).  Meanwhile, uncertainties about future regulatory
roles and the staff cutbacks currently being discussed in some
states are creating a serious management problem:  how to keep good
staff members now, and how to attract a new, highly adaptable type
of professional in the future.

Industry's Concerns: Reorganizations and Equities

     Communications industry officials share many of the
regulators' concerns and have several additional ones:

     *    Networks:  Networks must be modernized, and depreciation
rules must be changed to reflect faster write-offs.  Carriers favor
an evolutionary approach to modernization efforts, hoping to get
the maximum benefits from past investments.  And they want to
ensure that new and older networks, portions of which will exist
long into the future, are interoperable.  Telcos are concerned that
if they offer only a transmission pipe in the future, network
robustness and innovation will be lost.  They say that if the
public switched network (PSN) is unbundled and opened to all
service providers, proprietary network "intelligence" eventually
will be moved out of the PSN.  The value-added intelligence that
makes one network superior to another will reside elsewhere.

     *    Speed:  In the computer industry, extremely rapid product
cycles are the norm, and the telecom industry wants to move in that
direction.  The world won't wait for big, ponderous telecom
companies to make systematic decisions as in the past.  A faster
approach will be necessary to keep pace with entrepreneurs, and a
change in the telecom industry's public image also will be needed
(the public doesn't look to the telecom industry for innovation).

     *    Regulation:  Regulators don't allow the "trial and error"
necessary for development of new products and services, and some
companies currently are barred from offering certain services.  The
situation is further complicated by regulatory requirements that an
innovation be ubiquitous throughout a telco's service area.  

     Regulatory rules often handicap incumbents, making their
response to marketplace demands slow, cumbersome, and expensive. 
And regulators haven't been willing to address certain politically
charged issues--e.g., geographic rate deaveraging--that arise in a
competitive environment.

     *    If We Build It, Will They Come?  It's hard to justify two
(or three, if electric utilities are included) networks to the home
today, and consumer demand for new services remains speculative. 
No one knows whether consumers will spend their discretionary
income on communications/entertainment services, or if they'll have
the spare time to use many of the services envisioned.

     *    Convergence:  An extremely complex transition is taking
place.  Instead of the much-ballyhooed industry convergence
predicted earlier, partnerships will develop for the bundling and
branding of services.  Companies (or industry segments) are likely
to have an identity crisis, being unable to define who they are or
what business they're in.  Whoever is first to offer one-stop
shopping in a new market will have tremendous advantages.  But then
there will be a market shakeout and a bloody field of would-be
competitors.

     *    Wall Street:  Explaining the current changes to Wall
Street analysts, institutional investors, and individual
shareholders is difficult, especially when the communications
industry itself has no clear sense of what the future holds. 
Meanwhile, vast amounts of capital are flowing into and out of an
industry that's in transition, and stock values and risk
assessments are being determined by new criteria.  Dislocations and
confusion are heightened when not only companies but also entire
industries are being reorganized.

IDAHO STAFF, U S WEST AGREE ON SERVICE QUALITY SETTLEMENT

     Under a settlement agreement reached by the Idaho Public
Utilities Commission staff and U S WEST Communications, Inc., the
telephone company could be liable for civil penalties of $7,500 a
month until it reaches and maintains a specified standard for
service quality.  The parties submitted the agreement last month to
the commission for review, and the PUC could consider whether to
accept, modify, or reject it at a meeting slated for this month,
Donald L. Howell II, state Deputy Attorney General, told SLCR.  

     The PUC's current rules do not specify sanctions for the
company if it fails to meet the standard, which calls for resolving
at least 90% of all out-of-service trouble reports within 24 hours. 
Under the agreement, the penalties will be paid into the state's
general fund.

AMERITECH WINS EIGHTH, NINTH CABLE TV FRANCHISES

     Ameritech New Media Enterprises, Inc., is continuing to rack
up local cable TV franchise agreements throughout the Midwest.  The
Ameritech Corp. subsidiary recently won its eighth and ninth
franchises in Southgate, Mich., and Greendale, Wis.  It plans to
invest about $3.5 million to build a two-way interactive cable TV
system in Southgate and $1 million to build a similar system in
Greendale.  Construction on the systems will begin during the next
few months.

     Ameritech New Media previously secured six cable TV franchises
in Michigan (SLCR, Nov. 17, 1995) and one in Glendale Heights, Ill. 
Alleging that Ameritech is cross-subsidizing its cable TV systems
using telephone ratepayer funds, cable TV interests are seeking a
court order blocking further construction in Glendale Heights
(SLCR, Nov. 3 and Dec. 1, 1995).

     Meanwhile, Ameritech New Media has received permission to
begin building cable TV systems in Berea and Columbus, Ohio,
pending the finalization of franchise agreements in those cities. 
Overall, Ameritech New Media is engaged in franchise negotiations
with more than 40 communities in the Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee,
Cleveland, and Columbus areas.

PACIFIC BELL SEEKS APPROVAL TO DOUBLE ISDN RATES

     Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities
Commission for permission to double the per-minute rates for its
integrated services digital network (ISDN) service and to add a
$125 installation fee.  The company said it needs the rate
increase--from 1 cent to 2 cents per minute--because of the
"exploding" demand for service in areas where it is costly to
install and maintain the service.

     ISDN use has until recently been concentrated near central
offices in metropolitan areas, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said. 
But she said the increase in consumer use of the Internet and
online services--along with increasing popularity of telecommuting-
-has led to more residential installations.  The company's current
ISDN rates will remain in place pending the PUC's decision, which
could take six months or more, she added.

U S WEST MEETS COLORADO DEADLINE FOR SINGLE-PARTY SERVICE

     Avoiding a potential revenue loss of $550,000 a month, U S
WEST Communications, Inc., has converted all Colorado multi-party
lines to single-party service, meeting a Dec. 31 deadline.  The
conversions were required by the Public Utilities Commission's
orders in the second phase of the Rural Facilities Improvement
Program.  The company earlier had sought a waiver from the
requirement, indicating that it did not expect to complete the
conversions last month.

     The PUC had been considering late last year whether to direct
U S WEST to eliminate "tariff riders" which allow the telco to
recover the cost of the conversions.  The rider charges on
subscribers' bills represent $550,000 in monthly revenues, a U S
WEST spokesman told SLCR.  U S WEST said its employees made an
"extraordinary effort" to complete the upgrades by Dec. 31.

TELEMARKETING FRAUD

     Georgia's new Secretary of State, Lewis Massey, has announced
that "attacking telemarketing fraud" will be among his "immediate
priorities."  He said that Georgia consumers lost more than $500
million to telephone fraud. 

     Mr. Massey was sworn into office earlier this month by Gov.
Zell Miller (D.) to succeed Max Cleland.  Mr. Cleland resigned to
run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sam Nunn (D.), who has
announced he will not seek reelection.

PA. BEATS FEDERAL PREEMPTION DEADLINE WITH INTRALATA ORDER

Pennsylvania has become the 17th state to order establishment of
intraLATA toll dialing parity, making it the last state likely
to beat a preemption deadline contained in the pending federal
telecom bill.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) has ordered all
telcos to implement intraLATA dialing parity during 1997.

By acting late last month, the PUC made it likely Pennsylvania
will be among the states escaping preemption under the intraLATA
toll dialing provisions of the pending federal telecom reform
legislation.

In its current form, the federal legislation would preempt any
multiLATA state that voted to order intraLATA toll dialing
parity after December 1995, until such time as the resident Bell
regional entered the interLATA long-distance market.  Single-
LATA states would be exempt from the preemption.  States that
acted prior to the cutoff date would be "grandfathered" and
their programs would be allowed to run to completion.

Under the PUC order, Bell Atlantic and other Pennsylvania telcos
with more than 250,000 lines must complete implementation by
July 1997, while smaller telcos have until the end of 1997.

The PUC went along with the November recommendations of an
administrative law judge (ALJ) for intraLATA parity, except on
the issue of timing.   The ALJ had wanted to give large telcos
just six months to comply, but Bell Atlantic successfully argued
for a longer implementation period, citing the need to make
network modifications that require relatively long lead times.

AT&T and MCI had opposed stretching the implementation period,
saying any extension would shield Bell Atlantic's near monopoly
in intraLATA toll from serious competition for the additional
time.

FIVE MORE STATES MAKE MOVES ON INTRALATA TOLL DIALING PARITY

In addition to Pennsylvania, the states of Michigan, Wisconsin,
Arizona, New Jersey and Indiana also got in under the federal
wire with various requests for intraLATA toll dialing parity.

In Michigan, regulators have asked federal authorities to grant
Ameritech the interLATA long-distance waivers required for the
telco to comply with inter- and intraLATA toll competition
mandates contained in a 1995 state telecom law.

The Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) has petitioned for
a waiver of the federal interLATA service restrictions so that
Ameritech can comply with Michigan legislative toll competition
requirements that link provision of interLATA long-distance to
intraLATA toll dialing parity.

In a letter asking the U.S. Department of Justice to petition
U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene for interLATA relief,
the Michigan PSC said the requested waiver will enable Ameritech
Michigan to fulfill a directive in Michigan's 1995 state telecom
reform act that the company should begin providing intrastate
interLATA long-distance services as soon as possible, and be
offering such services to at least 50 percent of its customers
in competitive local markets by May of 1996.

Michigan Gov. John Engler Nov. 30, 1995, signed into law the
state telecom reform act (SB-722, Act 216) that, among other
things, prohibits mandatory implementation of full intraLATA
"1+" toll dialing parity in any market area where the serving
telco is not providing interLATA long-distance service.

In Ameritech's case, however, once that company receives federal
permission to begin interLATA service in Michigan, the 1995
state law makes intraLATA dialing parity mandatory immediately
in Ameritech market areas where interLATA service is legal and a
local exchange competitor has been certified.

Competitive local Ameritech markets include Grand Rapids and
Detroit.

The PSC implemented dialing parity for intraLATA WATS services
in 1991, and in August 1994 issued an order requiring Ameritech
to implement full dialing parity for all intraLATA interexchange
services by Jan. 1, 1996, an order that the telco still was
fighting to modify when the new state law was enacted.

The Michigan law also contains a directive to the Engler
administration and the PSC that they collectively pursue the
federal relief necessary to allow Ameritech to fulfill the state
law's toll competition provisions.

An Ameritech Michigan spokesman said the company fully supports
the state's efforts, but added that Ameritech will not be
providing any interLATA long-distance service in Michigan until
federal authorities issue a waiver or grant other relief from
the interLATA service ban.

The PSC is awaiting a reply from Justice before deciding its
next step.

In addition to the new waiver request submitted to the Justice
Department by the Michigan PSC, Ameritech has pending before
Judge Greene its own request for an interLATA service trial in
the Grand Rapids and Chicago LATAs, which Justice supports.

The big complicating factor in all this is what Congress will do
regarding interLATA relief for Ameritech and the other Bell
regionals when, or if, a final federal telecom bill emerges from
the House-Senate conference committee.

In Wisconsin, a state court has refused to stay a Public Service
Commission (PSC) order requiring Ameritech Wisconsin to begin
implementation of intraLATA dialing parity this month, with
completion of the process by July.

Dane County Circuit Court Judge Mori Krueger ruled that
Ameritech had not shown that it was incapable of fulfilling the
order or that it would suffer great harm if the PSC order were
implemented.

In Arizona, the Corporation Commission has given U S West and
other large telcos until April 20 to implement full intraLATA
toll dialing parity, as part of an order authorizing intraLATA
competitors to begin operations.

That deadline is about 10 weeks earlier than the original July
1, 1996, implementation deadline specified in the January 1995
order opening the intraLATA toll market to competition.

While the order did not detail the reasons behind the move, the
new date may have been a compromise to settle a pending dispute
between U S West and interexchange carriers over the validity of
intraLATA equal access requests filed by interexchange carriers
last summer when they applied for intraLATA certification.

The order authorizes AT&T and MCI to begin intraLATA toll
service; Sprint has a request for intraLATA authorization still
pending.

In the order authorizing the intraLATA competitors, the
commission also further streamlined regulation of interexchange
carrier services.  The new rules eliminate the 14-day notice
period for changes to toll discounts, allowing carriers to
modify or introduce toll discount plans the same day as notice
is given to the commission and the public.  However, no discount
can take the price below total service long run incremental
cost.

Changing the tariffed ceiling rates from which discounts are
figured still requires a commission review.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is scheduled to release
a proposed order for intraLATA toll presubscription Jan. 16.

Comments on that order will be taken until Feb. 15, after which
the board will decide whether to adopt or modify its proposal.
A final decision could come as early as mid-March.

In Indiana, the Utility Regulatory Commission has scheduled
evidentiary hearings Feb. 7-9 on a joint petition by four
interexchange carriers seeking establishment of full intraLATA
toll dialing parity.

The petition by AT&T, Sprint, LDDS Worldcom and LCI
International demands establishment of intraLATA parity as soon
as technically feasible.

Final prefiled material must be submitted by Jan. 17.  Final
post-hearing briefs are due March 8 with final reply briefs due
April 1.  Under its procedural rules, the commission must reach
a decision before July.

However, by acting in 1996, Indiana may find itself preempted by
the pending federal act.

JANUARY 11, 1996

STATES REGAIN SOME GROUND AS TELECOM BILL ENTERS HOME STRETCH

State utility commissions have retained some important areas of
authority over local telecom competition in a newly compromised
federal telecom act now getting the finishing touches in a
House-Senate conference committee in Congress.

But the federal act also will allow parties to seek Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) preemption of a state's actions
on grounds that they conflict with the federal law.

And the act gives the states no significant role in determining
whether a Bell company can enter the interLATA long-distance
market.

The final compromise between the differing House and Senate
versions of the act looks like it largely will hew to the House
version but with Senate language on some key issues such as
universal service, according to a 281-page draft obtained by
State Telephone Regulation Report.

Right now, the federal bill appears to be a compromise that
nobody really loves, but which the major interest groups think
they can live with.

The deal appears to be jelling as key factions release
statements endorsing the draft measure, including the
Telecommunications Industry Association, the National
Association of Broadcasters and the Alliance for Competitive
Telecommunications (which represents the Bell companies'
interests).

There's also been a lack of strenuous objection to the draft
from the United States Telephone Association (USTA) or the
Competitive Telecommunications Association (CompTel),  which
represents interexchange carrier interests.

Of course, there is always the possibility that further
jockeying among congressional leaders could upset the developing
accord or add to the time before the conference bill is put to a
floor vote in both chambers.

The draft conference bill requires states to remove all barriers
to competitive entry in telecom markets.  It also establishes
the checklist of services that all major telcos must make
available to competitors.

The bill allows states to set their own rules governing
competition, provided the state rules do not conflict with
federal rules and policies regarding competition.

The FCC must issue a set of national rules defining the
framework for interconnection, unbundling, resale and other
competition requirements within six months of the bill's
effective date.

Within the framework established by the FCC, states can
promulgate rules on interim number portability, access to
rights-of-way, reciprocal compensation and other issues.

But the bill allows the FCC to preempt a state rule if it
violates the federal bill's local competition requirements.

The bill makes physical on-site collocation the national default
option for network interconnection, but allows states the option
of letting a telco provide virtual, or offsite, collocation.

States also can exempt small telcos from competition
requirements where compliance with a particular provision would
be "unduly economically burdensome" or not technically feasible.

"Small" telcos are defined as those with fewer than than 2
percent of the nation's access lines.

The states retain jurisdiction over interconnection agreements
negotiated between local competitors and incumbents, and can
reject an agreement if it violates the public interest, among
other grounds.  If a state does not reject a proposed agreement
within 90 days, the pact automatically goes into effect.

If interconnection negotiations don't produce an agreement after
135 days of trying, a competitor can call on state regulators
for binding arbitration, where the state sets the rates and
implementation schedule.

If a state must set the rates for interconnection, transport and
termination, it must allow each carrier to recover its costs.

Although states "may include a reasonable profit" when setting
the rates, they cannot impose a rate-of-return ceiling on
interconnection services or penalize a provider that generates a
greater actual profit margin from such services.

However, the federal bill again allows the FCC to step in and
take charge of any interconnection proceeding upon a complaint
or other indication that a state is not regulating
interconnection services in a manner consistent with the federal
law.

Provisions barring states from imposing rate-of-return
regulation on noncompetitive services have been deleted from the
compromise measure.

On local resale, the legislation requires that all services a
telco retails also must be offered to resellers at wholesale.

The bill settles the wholesale discount squabbles by defining
wholesale rates as the retail rate minus costs such as billing,
collection and marketing that the telco avoids by selling to a
competitor.

States are allowed to bar local resellers from reselling
residential local service to business customers.

The legislation also mandates sharing of network facilities
where one telco, typically a smaller one, wants to rely on
specialized facilities of a larger telco in order to provide
services the small telco cannot afford to provide on its own.
But the bill says the small telco cannot force a large telco to
share facilities if the small company will use the shared
resources in the large telco's service territory.

The states retain jurisdiction over public safety requirements,
such as "911" emergency dialing systems, in a competitive local
marketplace.

State and local governments also retain their authority to
manage access to public rights-of-way, provided they don't
discriminate among carriers.

On universal service, the federal legislation allows state
regulators to determine which carriers will be eligible to
receive universal service subsidies from a fund, but requires
that all telecom providers contribute to the universal service
support system.

States can impose their own universal service requirements and
definitions of the universal service entitlement.  But those
requirements and definitions must be consistent with a national
policy framework to be established by a federal-state joint
board, acting under a set of principles embodied in the federal
legislation.

Such principles include a requirement that comparable rates and
services must be available in rural and urban areas.

Another principle to be embodied in universal service policy is
that public schools and libraries are entitled to a discount, to
be set by the FCC, on all telecom services.

This means providers will be able to seek compensation for their
losses on discounted school/library service through the
universal service fund.

While the states kept important areas of authority in the local
exchange, they did not fare so well in the federal bill's
sections on interexchange services.

The final bill does not give states a major role in the process
of approving interLATA long distance entry by the Bell

companies, and restricts the states' ability to require
intraLATA toll dialing parity.

The bill immediately lets a Bell company provide long distance
service between points outside its region, as well as
"incidental" interLATA long-distance connections used for its
other services such as cellular or video.

No FCC or state approval is required.

For authorizing Bell interLATA long- distance within the region,
the bill places the decision in the hands of the FCC, which must
find that Bell entry is in the public interest.

A Bell company can apply for in-region authority immediately;
the FCC has 90 days to decide.  The FCC can grant permission on
a state-by-state basis or region wide.

For each state, the applicant Bell company must show that at
least one facilities-based local exchange competitor is
operating in at least one city in the state.

The applicant must also show that it has made interconnection
available to competitors, offers nondiscriminatory access to
poles and conduits, and has unbundled local loops, interoffice
local transport and local switching.

The Bell also must demonstrate its willingness to offer services
for resale, provide reciprocal compensation and offer
competitors access to "911" services, directory assistance,
local operator call completion services, and white pages
directory listings.

Also, the Bell must offer number portability either by a state-
approved interim system or through full portability once the FCC
has issuesd the rules.

If after 10 months the Bell company has seen no local competitor
express serious interest in taking service under the state-
approved local interconnection provisions for a particular
state, or had only a taker that negotiated in bad faith, the
Bell can self-certify compliance with the competitive checklist
for that state.

The FCC must consult with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on a
Bell company's in-region interLATA application and must give
"substantial weight" to the DOJ's view, but the final FCC
decision does not have to conform to the DOJ opinion.

The bill does not permit a state to impose mandatory intraLATA
dialing parity on a Bell company until the telco enters the
interLATA long-distance business.

Single-LATA states, however, are exempt from this provision, as
are states that acted during or before December 1995.

Dialing parity, already in place in interLATA long-distance,
means the ability to place a call on a competing carrier's
network by dialing the same number of digits as needed to use
the incumbent carrier's network.

In other provisions, the bill also repeals a federal restriction
on the nation's 14 largest multistate electric utility
companies, which are regulated by a 1935 federal holding company
act that kept them from entering the telecom business.

These companies must establish a separate telecom subsidiary
that must obtain market entry permission from the FCC.

The parent electric utility cannot sell facilities or other
assets to the telecom unit without state approval.

All affiliate transactions between the parent and the subsidiary
are subject to audit by the state commissions, which can inspect
the books of parent and subsidiary alike.  The utility's telecom
subsidiary cannot issue its own stock or debt.  Nor can the
parent utility mortgage its operations to finance its telecom
operation.

The parent utility must also file reports with the FCC regarding
capitalization of the telecom venture.

The final federal bill allows a Bell company into manufacturing,
by means of a separate subsidiary, as soon as it is allowed to
provide interLATA long-distance.  A Bell operating company
cannot discriminate in any way in favor of the manufacturing
affiliate or its products.

For four years after enactment, the bill requires Bell
electronic publishing to be through a fully separate subsidiary
with its own marketplace identity.

The bill also bans all Bell companies other than Ameritech from
entering the alarm monitoring business for five years.
Ameritech already owns an alarm monitoring company, but would be
prohibited from acquiring any additional alarm companies for
five years.

The bill's sections on cable TV aim to give cable the
flexibility and profitability to compete against local telcos.

It deregulates cable rates for "upper tier" services at the
earlier of March 1999 or the date when "effective competition"
exists in a market, such as from a telco's video programming
services.

Small cable operators, those with fewer than 1 percent of all
U.S. cable subscribers, are rate deregulated immediately.

Until rates are deregulated, cable rate complaints to the FCC
can be made only by the local franchising authority.  And that
authority can't complain unless it has received subscriber
complaints within the first 90 days after a rate increase.

While retaining current federal regulations for wireless cable,
pure common carrier video systems and telco-owned cable TV
systems, the bill creates a new category called "open video
systems" where the transmission provider can own some of the
programming content.

Such open systems must leave one-third of the transmission
capacity open to other content providers.

Such systems are exempt from local franchise fees, but may be
assessed a local tax in lieu of the franchise fee.

The FCC has six months to write the rules governing this new
category of open video systems, and will decide telco
applications seeking this type of regulation.

Telcos under the bill cannot have more than a 10 percent
interest in a cable system in their service areas unless the FCC
issues a waiver.

Exceptions from this rule are made if the cable system serves a
rural area of under 35,000 population, or the telco itself has
below $100 million in annual revenues and the cable system has
less than 20,000 subscribers, or the cable system serves fewer
than 10 percent of the households in the telco's service area.

The bill also allows TV broadcasters to buy cable TV systems and
narrows sharply the grounds for the FCC to turn down renewal of
a broadcaster's license.  It also loosens current limits on how
many radio and TV stations one entity can own in the nation's 50
largest markets.

The bill also prohibits transmission of indecent as well as
obscene material over electronic networks under penalty of a
$100,000 fine and up to 10 years in jail.

And it requires TV manufacturers to include a special chip in
sets so that parents can program the TV to block display of
shows that carry high violence content ratings.

As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expedited
judicial review of these provisions, meaning any appeals will go
directly from the federal district court to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

CALIF. PUC KICKS OFF LOCAL COMPETITION IN $7 BILLION MARKET

The California Public Utility Commission (PUC) last week kicked
off local exchange competition in the nation's largest local
telecom marketplace as it implemented rules for the 31 companies
authorized late last month to compete for    $7 billion in local
exchange revenues from 15 million access lines.

The PUC rules for open competition are similar to rules proposed
in July 1995 when the PUC began accepting certification
applications.

Although competition is now legal for all switched and non-
switched local services, it will be at least a few months before
the new entrants can actually begin advertising for customers
and delivering competitive service.

During the interim, new competitors will be negotiating
interconnection terms with incumbent telcos Pacific Bell and GTE
California, as well as preparing tariffs or price lists for
their services.

For the first year, terminating compensation will be addressed
through the bill-and-keep method, where the originating network
keeps all the charges for a local call.

The rules also protect consumers against unfair business
practices, for disclosure of rates and terms of service, and for
resolving complaints.

The PUC rules require all local providers to interconnect with
"911" answering points, and to the state telephone relay system
for the handicapped.

New providers also must offer a lifeline rate, and must provide
customers with a written confirmation of each sale in the same
language as the original sale was made.

The companies certified as local exchange competitors include
GTE California and Pacific Bell, which now are authorized to
compete for local exchange customers in each others' service
areas.

The others authorized to provide competitive local phone
services include:  Advantage Communications, Associated Group
Inc., AT&T, five local units of Brooks Fiber Inc., Cable Plus
Company, Century Telecom, Continental Telecom, Electric
Lightwave Inc., Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications.

Also, Linkatel Pacific, MCImetro, MFS Intellenet, NewTelco,
Nextlink, Pac-West Telecom, three local units of Teleport
Communications Group, Viacom Communications and Winstar
Wireless.

The rules also protect consumers against unfair business
practices, for disclosure of rates and terms of service, and for
resolving complaints.

In addition to its interconnection, unbundling and public safety
requirements, the PUC also has expanded its bans against the
unlawful practice of "slamming" (unauthorized changes to the
presubscribed carrier) to include unauthorized changes in local
exchange provider.

Also, all local providers are prohibited from "redlining," or
designating certain neighborhoods as low priority for service
installations or repairs.

In a related action, the PUC says it will seek a bill in the
1996 California state legislature to allow implementation of a
state universal service fund that will subsidize companies
serving high-cost areas.

The PUC's proposed universal service support system calls for
giving customers in high-cost areas a phone bill credit for the
difference between what they pay and what it costs their local
provider to serve them.

The local telecom provider will be compensated from the
universal service fund.  Any local provider would be able to
receive payments from the fund, provided it is willing to serve
all the customers in an area.

Instead of traditional cost studies, the PUC proposes
determining the costs of local service through a proxy formula
based on population, terrain, climate, technology and loop
lengths.

If enabling legislation is passed, the PUC in June plans to
define the universal service entitlement, establish the revenue
source for the universal service fund, identify the high-cost
areas eligible for subsidy, designate the reference rates, and
prescribe a standard format for notifying customers about
services and rates.

SEVEN OTHER STATES TAKE STEPS ON THE ROAD TO LOCAL COMPETITION

California is not the only state with action in local
competition.  Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, Nebraska, Maryland,
Virgina and Illinois have seen movement on local competition
issues.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) last week began a
series of evidentiary hearings, that will last until March, on
proposed rules for local exchange telephone competition.

Hearings will continue Jan. 12, 25 and 26; on each Thursday and
Friday in February, and March 7 and 8.  A proposed order is
expected around the first week in April.  The PUC must issue a
final order by May 31 in order for the rules to take effect July
1, as required under the state's 1995 local competition law.

A working group convened last June to find consensus on local
competition came to agreements on numbering portability and most
aspects of "911" provisioning, but on other local competition
issues was able only to outline alternative positions of the
major interest groups, which will be addressed during the
hearings.

Also figuring in the hearings will be public concern aired in a
series of public forums held around the state last fall.

Some issues raised in all 16 public sessions included concerns
that effective statewide local competition is an unrealistic
goal, and that less-wealthy or thinly populated areas will
suffer from diminished investment and attention in a competitive
market.

Rural residents were concerned that advanced telecom services
won't reach smaller communities, impairing their economic
development.

Many state residents recognized that the current definitions of
basic telephone service are 10 years behind technology, but most
don't want to pay for advanced capabilities until they are ready
to make  use of such services.

The forums showed most people recognize the need for a strong
government watchdog agency to police a competitive telecom
markeplace.

The forums also showed most people support the idea of a state
fund to preserve universal service, but that a sizeable minority
oppose any subsidized phone service rates.

Cincinnati Bell has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to void the
local exchange competition decisions of the Ohio Public
Utilities Commission, on grounds that the PUC exceeded its
statutory authority in approving local competition.

The telco contends that current law did not give the PUC the
right to issue the competitive local exchange certificate
granted to Time Warner Communications

in October for the 37 Ohio counties where Time Warner cable
systems operate, nor to certify any of the other local
competitors approved since then.

Under Cincinnati Bell's interpretation, the state legislature
must first pass enabling legislation giving the PUC the explicit
right to approve local competition.

Cincinnati Bell and other telcos previously asked the PUC to
reverse itself on authorizing local competition, but were
refused; Cincinnati Bell said its court appeal is the next step
provided by law.

In Virginia, MFS Communications became the first company to seek
switched basic exchange authority from the Corporation
Commission under a 1995 state law that allowed full local
competition as of Jan. 1.

MFS said it plans to offer one-stop-shopping for local and toll
services to smaller businesses in local exchanges of Bell
Atlantic and GTE.  MFS already provides non-switched services in
Richmond and Northern Virginia.

The commission has 180 days to rule on certification
applications.  The commission also is continuing to work on
local competition rules, with comments on resale issues due
March 1 and comments on universal service support due April 1.

AT&T has asked the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) for
authority to provide residential and business local service
statewide.

AT&T initially plans to resell local services of Bell Atlantic
but eventually wants to operate its own local exchange
facilities.

Before AT&T begins business operations, however, the company
said Maryland regulators must establish unrestricted resale and
cost-based wholesale prices, and implement interconnection
principles that guarantee access to other providers' networks on
fair and reasonable terms.

The Maryland PSC last week adopted some important rules for
implementing local competition in that state.

The commission established one of the lowest interconnection
rates in the country - a half-cent per minute.  This is far
below the 2.1 cents interim rate established more than a year
ago.

The commission rules also require interim numbering portability,
and require all providers to offer access to "911" services.

Under the rules, local competitors will be able to define their
own local calling areas.  They will not have to use the calling
areas established by Bell Atlantic.

Meanwhile, AT&T in Illinois has asked the Commerce Commission to
require Ameritech Illinois to offer deeper local resale
discounts comparable to the resale discounts that exist in the
long-distance business.

AT&T, which has been authorized in Illinois as a local exchange
provider, has been unable to negotiate a  satisfactory resale
agreement with Ameritech and wants the commission to impose more
favorable resale terms.

AT&T contends the 6 percent to 8 percent discounts offered in
Ameritech's wholesale local tariffs are insufficient to allow
AT&T to make money.  AT&T contended local wholesale rates for
resale should run closer to the 33 percent to 50 percent resale
discounts that AT&T says prevail in the long-distance business.

Also in Illinois, the Commerce Commission has approved a
petition by an affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems
(SBMS) to sell wireline local services under the Cellular One
brand name that is used for cellular service.

The authority granted to SBMS Illinois Services Inc., allows it
to offer wireline local services alongside existing cellu-

lar services in the Chicago LATA.  The company will be filing
its wireline local exchange tariffs soon.

SBMS also is authorized as a wireline provider in New York,
where it operates in Buffalo and Rochester under the Cellular
One name.  The company is eying Massachusetts, Maryland and
Washington, D.C., where it already operates cellular systems.

Under the FCC waiver that allows SBMS to bundle cellular and
wireline services outside the Southwestern Bell region, the
wireline local services are handled through a separate corporate
entity that shares facilties, systems, personnel and management
with the cellular operation.

In Michigan, an Ameritech business unit, formed to provide local
exchange services and interexchange services once the federal
interLATA restrictions are lifted, has withdrawn its application
before the Michigan PSC for authority to provide local services
in Grand Rapids and Detroit (STRR Sept. 21, 1995).

Ameritech Communications Inc. (ACI) asked the commission to
dismiss its application without prejudice, saying it did not
want to pursue the matter at this time.

ACI had anticipated providing services either under terms of a
trial interLATA waiver pending before Judge Harold Greene, or
under the federal telecom legislation.  ACI planned to target
customers who prefer one-stop shopping for an integrated package
of local and long-distance services.

The ACI certification application had raised difficult questions
about what kinds of state regulatory safeguards are required for
a traditional telephone company who is both a local competitor
and the local incumbent in the same city.

The Nebraska PSC has opened a rulemaking with the goal of
implementing full local exchange competition in 1997.

The PSC's goals are to begin certification of switched basic
exchange competitors by the start of 1997, with competitors to
begin operation in switched services by July 1997.

The PSC has proposed several conditions that must be met before
local markets become fully competitive.

Those include reasonable local rates, provision of full
intraLATA toll dialing parity, provision of local numbering
portability, and a support system to preserve universal service
in a competitive environment.  A procedural schedule will be
developed soon.

Nebraska allows partial local competition in private lines and
other non-switched local services, but up to now has not opened
the switched local services.

CARRIER TO BE INVESTIGATED

The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has decided to
take a more aggressive approach against slamming by keeping
carriers out of the state's markets who appear unfit to operate
or likely to operate illegally.

Accordingly, the PUC's safety and enforcement division has
recommended that the PUC reject a petitition by EqualNet
Communications for authority to provide intrastate interexchange
service in California.

According to the division, EqualNet should not be allowed into
California because it appears to be using deceptive and
misleading marketing practices, including slamming, which is the
unauthorized switching of a customer's presubscribed long
distance carrier.

In addition, said the division, EqualNet misrepresents itself as
being affiliated with AT&T in order to induce customers to
change.

During 1995, the PUC received 110 complaints against EqualNet
and, added the enforcement division, the company has been the
subject of slamming complaints in Illinois, Kansas and North
Carolina.

PRICE REGULATION REVAMPED

The California PUC has decided to freeze the rates of Pacific
Bell and GTE California through 1998.

For Pac Bell, the freeze takes effect immediately, but GTE will
have to make one final price adjustment under the old indexing
formula in 1996.  GTE rates will then be frozen for 1997 and
1998.

The two telcos had petitioned the PUC to eliminate the price-cap
indexing formula used to regulate rates under California's
hybrid system of price and earnings regulation for its big
telcos.

The formula pegs annual price adjustments to the gross domestic
product price index minus a 5 percent productivity factor.  With
the low inflation of recent years, the telcos have had to make
substantial rate cuts each year.

Rather than setting a productivity offset that is less than
inflation, which would have resulted in rate increases, the PUC
made the productivity offset equal to inflation.  This in effect
freezes rates.

TOLL PLAN WON'T BE DELAYED

The Florida Public Service Commission has denied motions from
interexchange carriers to delay implementation of a BellSouth
message-rate plan for intraLATA toll pricing.

The plan, to go into effect Jan. 15, sets a flat price of 25
cents for a residential intraLATA toll call, regardless of
distance, duration or time of day.  Business customers will pay
10 cents the first minute and  6 cents per additional minute.

The plan, said BellSouth, will reduce its intraLATA toll
revenues by around $25 million.

AT&T, MCI and other interexchange carriers wanted the starting
date delayed so the competitive implications of the plan could
be more fully explored.

VIDEO INTERESTS FIGHT TAX

Cable and satellite video providers have filed a suit in the
Illinois courts to overturn a Chicago city amusement tax applied
to video gross receipts.

The video companies say the 7 percent tax on gross revenues is
unconstitutional because it taxes a selected mode of electronic
speech while exempting other equivalent electronic channels of
expression such as TV broadcasting.

The tax also allegedly discriminates against cable subscribers
by assessing them extra to fund city services that benefit the
entire population.

The plaintiffs also contend the city tax, if upheld, would set a
dangerous precedent for local taxation of online information
services, home shopping networks and other electronic
information media.

Further, the cable companies argue the tax is double taxation of
cable by the city, since there is no credit given for the local
franchise taxes cable companies already pay.

COMPETITION, CRIME, PSC PRACTICES DOMINATE '95 STATE PHONE LAWS

Legislation addressing telephone competition, telephone crime,
and state regulatory practices and structures dominated state
lawmaking in 1995.

Of the 49 states that met in session in 1995 to consider close
to 1,000 proposed telecom-related bills, 38 states produced new
telecom laws, with legislation on competition, crime and
commission structures and practices accounting for 53 of the 92
measures that made it onto state lawbooks this year.

State legislatures in 1995 produced an unprecedented outpouring
of legislation relating to telephone competition and
deregulation; these closely related topics together accounted
for 26 of the 92 state laws passed.

But telephone crime and state regulatory structures also were a
focus for strong legislative activity in 1995.  These two areas
together accounted for another 27 new telecom laws in 1995.

Other areas that got significant legislative attention in the
1995 legislatures included "911" emergency dialing (eight laws),
physical telecom facilities and infrastructures (eight laws) and
telecom taxation (seven laws).

There also was a scattering of state legislation passed on
consumer protection, extended area service, privacy, special
needs of the handicapped, universal service and abuses by
telemarketers.  Although in past years each of these topics
would account for a significant number of state laws, in 1995
these areas collectively accounted for just 17 laws passed.

In the area of competition and deregulation, 13 states passed
major new laws that effectively abolished their telephone
companies' legal local exchange monopolies, threw all local
services open to competition, and allowed more lenient
regulation of competitors.

Another 10 states enacted lesser measures affecting the scope
and direction of ongoing competition and deregulation activity.

Many observers attribute the flood of major state competition
laws in 1995 to the highly preemptive federal telecom
legislation that almost made it through the 103d Congress in the
fall of 1994.

That 1994 legislation would have forced open all closed telecom
markets while preempting outright many aspects of state
authority in the local exchange, and would have made the
remainder of the state jurisdiction into a creature dominated by
the FCC.  That legislation passed the House and likely would
have passed the Senate if not for a last-minute lobbying logjam
thrown up by local exchange and interexchange carriers as they
fought over the issue of Bell company entry into the interLATA
long-distance market.

The strong support for telecom reform and competition in the
103d Congress foreshadowed the drive to pass a telecom bill in
the 104th Congress.  State interests hoped that a strong state
movement to accommodate competition would head off the
preemption "hawks" in Congress.  The rush of successful state
competition bills did help the states' cause, but perhaps not to
the extent the states had expected.

Although they vary greatly in their details, the major
competition laws en-acted in 1995 by Colorado, Florida, Georgia,
Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming have several
general attributes in common.

All specify explicit dates in 1995 or in 1996 for the start of
wide open local exchange competition, require certification of
local competitors, permit lenient regulation of new local
entrants, direct state regulators to develop local competition
and interconnection rules, and require universal service
support.

The laws of Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming shield their smaller
telephone companies from local competition for time periods
ranging from three to 10 years.

These major state competition laws generally permit immediate
local service resale, except in Texas and Florida where local
resale is restricted while federal interLATA restrictions on
Bell and GTE remain in effect.

Except for Hawaii, these major laws generally allow regulators
flexibility to adopt price-based alternatives to rate-of-return
regulation for incumbent telephone companies.  Hawaii's law bars
telco price regulation until effective local competition is
established.

However, the laws in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa,
Minnesota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming prescribe explicit
structures for price-based regulation of incumbent telcos that
state regulators must follow.

In addition to the sweeping laws described above, other 1995
laws related to competition and deregulation include a
Connecticut law that sets definite procedural deadlines for the
local competition rulemakings required by the 1994 law that
legalized local competition.

A California law allows regulators the option to control
competitive market entry through registration instead of
certification.  Another California law requires regulators to
find that mergers and acquisitions won't impair competition and
that benefits of the deal will be split evenly between
shareholders and ratepayers.

Michigan enacted a law that simplifies competitive market entry,
mandates local interconnection, deregulates competitive services
and all rate reductions, and requires arbitration of minor
disputes, among other provisions.  This law replaces an expiring
1991 telecom regulation act.

Bucking the pro-competition trend, an Idaho law and a provision
within the 1995 Michigan law prohibit state imposition of
mandatory intraLATA toll dialing parity  requirements on a telco
that is prohibited by federal edict from intraLATA long-distance
service.

But in a direct challenge to federal authorities, the Michigan
law also requires Ameritech and GTE to begin intrastate
interLATA service in 1996.

Idaho deregulated telecom resellers, while North Dakota
deregulated payphones and terminal equipment.  Wisconsin and
North Dakota increased the maximum line size of small telcos
eligible for deregulation.

State commissions in Washington and Oregon gained legal
authority to adopt price-based alternative regulation systems
for telephone companies.

Bucking the pro-competition trend, an Idaho law and a provision
within the 1995 Michigan law prohibit state imposition of
mandatory intraLATA toll dialing parity requirements on a telco
that is prohibited by federal edict from providing interLATA
long-distance service.

After competition, a major area of state legislative activity in
1995 was phone crime, either where the phone service provider is
the victim of crime, or where telephone service is an instrument
for commission of other crimes.

State legislatures in 1995 took aim at theft of telecom services
in response to industry complaints that up to 40 percent of
cellular airtime is being stolen, that some 5 percent of the
households in a typical urban cable market are stealing cable
programming, and that present penalties are too weak to be
effective in deterring theft of phone, cellular and cable
services.

Phone crime laws in Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,
North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington expanded previous law on
service theft to cover thefts of cellular and cable TV services.

These laws also increased penalties for all thefts of telecom
services and for enabling others to steal service, in many cases
upgrading the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony.

For example, Arizona's new theft-of-service law not only makes
phone service theft a felony.  It also denies parole or other
early release from confinement to any persons convicted of
stealing or enabling a theft where the crime involved more than
$100,000 worth of stolen telecom or utility service; they must
serve every day of the prescribed sentence.

A Massachusetts law sets the maximum penalty for theft of
telecom service at a $30,000 fine or 15 years in prison, while
an Oregon law sets the maximum penalty for stealing cellular
service, or enabling a cellular service theft, by means of an
unlawful "cloned" cellular phone at a $200,000 fine and 10 years
in prison.

Many of these new state phone crime laws also allow victims of
service theft to sue convicted perpetrators for civil damages.
In Washington state, a repeat offender now can be sued for
treble damages under the state's Criminal Profiteering Act.

Other new state laws addressing criminal uses of phones include
a Maine law allowing prosecutors to subpoena telephone
companies' customer call detail records where phone usage is
materially related to a criminal investigation.

A New Mexico law makes it a crime to use the telephone to
perpetrate telemarketing frauds, while Oregon and Virginia make
it a crime to call a "911" center for any purpose other than
reporting an actual emergency.

Georgia expands the crime of telephone harassment to include
"silent" harassing calls and phone calls intended to incite
minors to violence.

Legislation affecting the ways state commissions conduct their
business included laws in Tennessee and Texas that restructured
the state utility regulatory system.

Tennessee abolished the elected Public Service Commission,
effective July 1, 1996, and created a new appointed body, the
Tennessee Regulatory Authority, to take over regulation of
telecommunications and electric utilities; jurisdiction over
other regulated industries goes to other state agencies.

The new regulatory body is nonpartisan, and its members are
forbidden to engage in partisan politics while in office.

Texas passed a law recodifying the state utility regulatory act
into separate sections for telecommunications and other
utilities, so as to permit a reorganization of the Public
Utility Commission that structurally separates regulation of
telecommunications from regulation of electric companies and
other utilities.

The purpose is to separate telephone policy-making from that for
electric utilities as these respective industries become more
competitive.  Passage of the recodification law was required
before the legislature could pass the 1995 telephone competition
law.

Laws in Kansas and Oregon allow regulators to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive utility data that otherwise would
have to be disclosed under open records laws.

A New Mexico law allows regulators to levy administrative fines
on telecom providers for regulatory violations, while a Rhode
Island law requires establishment of regulatory fees for telecom
filings made by new types of provider.

Another Rhode Island law allows regulators to assess cable TV
companies for the costs of reviewing mergers, acquisitions and
other transfers of control, while a South Dakota law requires
all telephone exchange sales to be approved by the state
commission.

State lawmaking on infrastructure and phone facilities includes
laws in California and Connecticut, and provisions in the
telecom competition laws of Florida and Texas, all intended to
encourage the spread of advanced telecom facilities for distance
learning and/or telemedicine applications.

Laws in California and Nevada assert localities' rights to
assess fees on facilities-based telecom service providers for
use of public rights-of-way, although the Nevada law puts a cap
on the fees or annual fee increases localities can impose.

A Maryland law establishes a three-year pilot program to
encourage use of telecommuting by government agencies, while a
Massachusetts law authorizes a $75 million state bond issue to
finance a 12-year program to link all trial courts, police and
public safety agencies, and prosecution and defense attorneys to
a statewide computer network for judicial information, case
processing and trial management.

In legislation affecting "911" emergency dialing services, a
Washington state law requires shared tenant service systems and
school phone systems to provide "911" location identification by
1997 for each phone connected to the system.

An Oregon law requires "911' districts with multiple answering
centers to consolidate them into a single location by 2001,
while another Oregon "911" law allows "911" districts to sell
bonds to finance system improvements, with voter approval, and
levy a tax to cover debt service.

In telecom taxation, Virginia and Pennsylvania passed laws
allowing local governments to levy a 5 percent video gross
receipts tax in lieu of a local franchise fee on new video
service suppliers, such as telco video dial-tone services, that
would compete against the incumbent cable TV company.

As introduced, these bills would have permitted local gross
receipts taxation of providers who sell TV programming through
home satellite dishes and other forms of wireless video
programming distribution that do not use terrestrial rights-of-
way.

But in the face of lobbying by the direct-to-home satellite
industry, the tax bills were amended to exempt program suppliers
who use satellites and other wireless distribution systems.

Other noteworthy state telecom laws passed in 1995 include
Georgia and Arizona measures that extend wiretap protections to
include cellular and/or cordless phones.

Nebraska established a program to distribute adaptive telephone
equipment to qualifying low-income handicapped persons.

Oregon capped the phone bill surcharge that supports subsidized
lifeline phone services at an amount sufficient to cover six
months of demand, while raising by a dime the cap on the
surcharge that supports the state telecom relay service for the
deaf.

A Tennessee law requires telephone companies to provide county-
wide toll free calling by 1996, while a Virginia law permits
county-wide toll free calling for counties where the municipal
governments and a majority of affected subscribers support it.

California and Connecticut enacted consumer protection laws to
combat the unlawful practice of "slamming" - switching a
presubscribed interexchange carrier without the customer's
authorization.

Another California law prohibits telephone companies from
billing for calls placed to 800-number information services that
do not comply with FCC subscription regulations.

A Georgia law requires that printed solicitations for inclusion
in classified telephone advertising directories must clearly
state that the notice is not a bill.

One 1995 bill still hanging in there is a measure in Oklahoma to
authorize all forms of local exchange competition and permit
alternative price regulation.

It was introduced late in Oklahoma's 1995 session.  While
introduced too late to win passage in 1995, the bill managed to
garner enough support to be carried over to the 1996 session.

DEMOCRATS, BELLS SCORE ON TELECOM BILL - WHICH DEBUTS THIS WEEK

Casey Stengel would be proud.  Turns out Stengel's axiom "it
ain't over 'til it's over" applies as aptly to telecom reform
legislation as it does to baseball games.

Late last month, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., chairman of the
House-Senate conference committee on the bill, thought he and
key committee members had struck a compromise that gave
concessions to the Clinton administration in order to avert a
threatened veto.  But when conservative Republicans heard about
the terms, they rebelled, forcing Pressler to call his deal just
a "framework agreement" and scuttling plans to bring the bill to
a pre-Christmas vote.

The new uncertainty left the bill vulnerable to more changes.
The latest draft of the bill is not public but a copy obtained
by Telco Business Report sister publication FCC Report shows
changes already have been made to Pressler's framework deal.
One of them is the removal of language that would have kept the
Bell companies from joint-marketing long-distance and local
service until a year after their local competitors were doing
so.

But, this time, it looks the deal will stick.  The Senate
Republican leadership is tacitly endorsing the new draft bill
and a key House Republican, Rep. Thomas Bliley of Virginia, is
calling on colleagues to vote for the revised measure.

Recognizing this, key sides in the yearlong battle have
curtailed their lobbying.  Jim Smith, president of the
Competitive Telecommunications Association, said his group of
local competitors doubts it will get the conference committee to
reverse itself and toughen a condition on Bell long-distance
entry.

At the United States Telephone Association, chief lobbyist Larry
Clinton said his group has given up hope of getting the
conference to undo a change to the bill that lets states use
rate of return regulation for competitive services.  The
provision was excised early last month by the conference
committee, which is producing a compromise version of the
telecom bills passed this summer by the House and Senate.

Another measure of how the deal is jelling:  Key factions are
releasing statements endorsing the new draft bill, even though
it has not been released.  Supporters include the
Telecommunications Industry Association, the Alliance for
Competitive Communications - the Bell's lobbying group - and the
National Association of Broadcasters.

The USTA and Comptel haven't issued statements, but Clinton said
he expects the USTA "will be OK" on the bill and Smith said his
group will find the bill "minimally acceptable" as long as it's
not changed more.

The heavy-hitters are checking their swings because they've
chalked up plenty of runs in this the last inning of bill's ball
game.  In recent days, the Bells have won the right to keep one
of their brethren, Ameritech, from expanding its alarm-
monitoring operations (TBR Dec. 18. 1995) beyond the company's
current holdings.  Ameritech, the only Bell the bill lets into
alarm monitoring - by "grandfathering" the company's current
holdings - now cannot expand its alarm monitoring presence until
after the five-year wait the bill imposes on all of the Bells
seeking to get into that line of business.

Ameritech's next alarm monitoring move was expected to be
outside of its territory.

The nation's 14 largest utility companies also scored by
convincing the conferees to let these federally regulated
utilities offer telecom services.

But the latest draft of the conference report - in effect, the
new telecom bill - shows that the biggest runs were scored by
the Democrats.  These include addition of a role for the
Department of Justice (DOJ) in assessing the long-distance entry

applications of the Bell companies.  Although the role is only
advisory, as the Senate bill originally offered, the change was
one of three called for by the White House when the
administration was threatening a veto.

Another recent change is adoption of the House bill's 35-percent
cap on the size of national audience that any one TV station
chain may accumulate.  The 35-percent cap, a part of the House
telecom bill added by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., addresses the
"media concentration" aspect of the bill, another prime White
House worry.

Those and other changes were added to the bill after a meeting
Dec. 13 between Pressler and Bliley and the two top Democrats on
the conference committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan and Sen.
Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.

For his part, sources say Hollings was able to convince Pressler
to remove from the bill entirely all language that would have
lifted the current 25-percent cap on foreign investment in FCC
licensees.

The next day, Pressler and Bliley were set to sell their deal to
House and Senate Republicans.  But that morning's newspapers
reported that Vice President Al Gore had endorsed the bill on
behalf of the Clinton administration, the entity most
conservative Republicans despise.

That error cost Pressler his run.  He was forced to call his
deal a "framework" - not an agreement - when key conferees,
including Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, the chairman of the House
telecom subcommittee and a key drafter of the House bill,
rebelled.  Fields released a statement saying, "There was no
deal" with the White House and then left to spend the holidays
with his family in Texas.

Fields likely will have to back down and vote for the conference
report, but at the moment all eyes are on House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga.  Rather than endorse the new bill, Gingrich has
called "time out," advising House Republicans to hold off on
voting on the conference report until after Congress returns to
session.  His staff said the speaker had not yet reviewed the
new language to see if it was sufficiently deregulatory.

Besides the new role for the DoJ in deciding Bell entry into
long-distance, other key aspects of the draft version of the
report are:

*  "Grandfathering" states that, as of Dec. 1995, require the
Bells to offer dialing parity,

*  Expedited judicial review of the bill's "cyberporn"
restrictions, and

*  Inclusion of the Senate bill's requirement that discounted
telecom service be offered to schools and libraries.  Now,
however, that requirement is part of the definition of universal
service itself, meaning that providers can seek compensation for
their loss via the universal service subsidy.

The DoJ's role on Bell long-distance entry will come as part of
the FCC's imposition of a public-interest test on Bell long-
distance applications, a concept taken from the Senate telecom
bill.  The FCC must give "substantial weight" to the DOJ's
assessment, but that assessment will not be decisive in itself,
the new version of the bill states.

The Pressler compromise also requires a Bell first to have a
facilities-based competitor in place - as the House wanted -and
give the FCC the power to test whether there is "actual and
demonstrable" local competition in the Bell's local market.  But
the Pressler framework agreement eliminates language adopted by
the conferees just days before that would have required Bell
long-distance entry to be predicated on the Bell facing
competition throughout each of its states, not just in one city
in each state.

The bill adopts the House bill's requirement that a Bell first
seek long-

distance entry by applying to its state commissions.  To be
certified by a state, a Bell must have met the bill's checklist
of unbundling and open access requirements and have a
facilities-based competitor in place in at least one location.
Gone is the language requiring a state to determine whether
local competition is prevalent "to an extent that demonstrates
that the telephone exchange market is competitive."

The bill does not require the Bells to provide dialing parity
until they enter the long-distance business, unless they operate
in a state that has only one LATA or which required the service
as of December 1995.  Dialing parity, already available in long-
distance, means the ability to place a local call on a competing
carrier's network by dialing the same number of digits as needed
by the local carrier's network.

The bill bans making indecent material available over electronic
networks, a hewing to the Senate bill's approach.  The bill's
penalties for sending "cyberporn" - a fine up to $100,000 and up
to 10 years in jail - are also the same as the Senate bill's,
but the draft bill uses the test of whether such material is
indecent, not the "harmful to minors" standard that has been
upheld by federal courts.

As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expedited
judicial review of this provision, meaning that legal challenges
to the law will, if appealed, go directly from the federal
district court to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Contrary to the House version of the telecom bill, the draft
agreement has no language banning the FCC from regulating the
Internet or letting the FCC selectively lift the 25-percent cap
on foreign ownership of FCC licensees.  But these changes may be
subject to change.  The Senate appears willing to accept
Pressler's view that the latter matter should be dealt with via
separate legislation - he says a bill will be introduced this
spring - but some in the House are still pressing their fight to
return their foreign ownership language to the bill.

In the Senate, Pressler believes he has "a good majority" but
his compromise has won an ardent foe, fellow conferee Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.  A source with McCain's office told FCC Report,
"My boss and others were beside themselves" when they heard
about the framework agreement.  The deal, he said, was worked
out behind closed doors, with the Hollings, the ranking
Democratic Senator on the conference committee, carrying water
for the White House.

McCain voted against the Senate bill when it came to the floor
and now his staff hints he will use his considerable power as a
senator to slow the conference report's progress in the Senate
until he wins his revisions.

AVOID PROFIT LOSS BY CREATING A SAFETY NET FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Telcos can avoid millions of dollars in profit loss by
monitoring errors in their accounts payable.

A new trend is developing whereby telcos and other
telecommunications companies are hiring auditing services to
double-check their books against overpayments, double payments
and missed sales.  Industrywide, telecom companies are estimated
to lose approximately $10 million to $20 million in profits due
to such accounting problems.

"In this industry, frequent corporate acquisitions and
divestitures, expanding geographic territories, numerous local
vendor relationships and multiple payables offices increase the
likelihood of profit loss," Ronald Loder, president and CEO of
Loder, Drew & Associates in

Irvine, Calif., recently told Telco Business Report.  Loder's
company handles such audits for roughly a dozen telcos, several
RBOCs and various telecom firms.

According to Loder, about 35 percent of the nation's Fortune
1,000 companies audit their accounts payable, item by item, to
recover overpaid funds and to establish systems and practices to
help reduce future profit loss.

"Absolutely every single company in the country is going through
a change right now," Loder said.  "And because everything is in
a state of flux, there are lots of accounts payable problems."

BellSouth Telecommunications, for example, had done what it
calls a "billing reconciliation" in which its central office
accounting procedures were reviewed for discrepancies.  The
process is similar to an audit, telco spokesman David Rogers
said, and was done to make sure the company wasn't losing money
through its accounting practices.

"There are no pending plans right now to have the process done
again," Rogers told TBR last week.  "But that doesn't mean there
aren't potential problems.  It's something that always has to be
looked at."

Loder, Drew & Associates provides its auditing services on a
contingency basis.  "We get paid 50 percent of what's
recovered," Loder said.

"And it's not unusual for us to recover $1 million in over-
payments for a telco," he added.  "That equates to $500,000 in
profit, which is tantamount to about $10 million in sales.  For
large or small companies, that's a lot of money."

Loder offers these five tips to ensure accurate accounts
payables:

*     Avoid manual check requests.  These are non-valued
transactions that require repeated attention from your payables
staff and often lead to errors.  "We've conducted more than
2,000 accounts payable audits and have uncovered numerous
payments that never appeared in the client's database because
they were written or logged by hand," Loder said.

*     Never pay from a copy of an invoice.  Loder said this is
the most common cause of double payments.  Vendors - local
equipment companies, network providers, computer programmers -
traditionally mail invoices directly to the central accounts
payable department.  In many cases, they send a copy of the
invoice by fax if they have not received payment after 10 days.
For telco companies that operate in several geographic regions
with multiple local vendors, these double invoices can amount to
hundreds of thousands of overpaid dollars, he said.

*     Be consistent when entering invoice numbers into the
accounts payable system.  Increasing use of advanced accounting
software has left gaping holes in telecom companies' payables
process, Loder explained.  His company's proprietary software,
for example, called Scansearch, cross-references invoices and
payments by vendor, category, product group and geographic
region and identifies errors that would otherwise be missed
without accurate invoice number tracking.  Inconsistent use of
invoice numbers leads to payment lapses, double payments and
over payments.  Be sure, Loder said, that every vendor payment
is directly tied to a specific invoice.

*     Avoid use of blanket purchase orders.  Every payment must
have a corresponding p.o. number and every p.o. number must have
a corresponding payment.  The key to error-free payment,
according to Loder, is careful tracking.  Numbered purchase
orders are essential to an orderly, traceable payables system.

*     Reconcile large vendor accounts frequently.  Loder said
his company's audits and subsequent reports indicate that
frequently reconciled vendor accounts allow for more efficient
cash management, improved vendor relations and accurate invoice-
to-payment tracking.

Accounts payable processing errors are one of the most common
sources of profit leaks within a company, and while "telcos are
very large corporations," Loder said, "they're less likely to
air their dirty laundry.  However, many now realize there are
real savings to be found out there."

IBM ALLIANCE ADVANCES AMERITECH'S DESKTOP SERVICES REACH

Ameritech and IBM have formed an alliance to give both companies
a stronger foothold in the swelling $30 billion desktop
computing market.

 Under terms of the new agreement, signed just before the
Christmas holiday, the telco and IBM will jointly market
integrated voice, data and video managed desktop services and
establish a 24-hour customer service facility to be operated by
Ameritech and IBM's Integrated Systems Solutions Corp (ISSC).
The one-stop center will support integrated voice, data and
video service line with a single phone call.

To achieve their goals, the companies together will provide $400
million during

the next seven years in desktop services to each other.  Both
Ameritech and IBM also stated they envision their alliance
growing during the next several years.

The creation of the alliance is Ameritech's response to the
transformation in

the telecommunications industry, Jack Reich, president of
Ameritech custom business services, said in announcing the
agreement.

"Ameritech is positioning itself to be at the forefront of
helping customers benefit from changes in technology," Reich
said.  "When we searched for the right partner to help us make
it happen, it was clear that IBM, and in particular ISSC, was
the perfect choice."

Ameritech and IBM plan to address the gamut of desktop services,
including telephones, printers, personal computers software,
wiring, local area networks, servers, videoconferencing,
equipment, fax equipment, voice mail, paging and wireless
equipment and technical support.

TIME WARNER ASKS PUCO TO INTERVENE WITH AMERITECH
INTERCONNECTION TALKS

After nearly a year of stale-mate with Ameritech over an
agreement to interconnect their telephone networks, Time Warner
Communications is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(PUCO) to intervene.  Time Warner made the request for PUCO
intervention in its second 60-day report to the commission on
the status of interconnection negotiations with Ameritech and
other incumbent telcos.  The PUCO must approve certain rules
under which telcos will compete before TW enters the market.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS RAISES TELCO'S LARGEST DIVIDEND IN FIVE YEARS

The board of directors just before Christmas raised Ameritech's
quarterly dividend 6 percent to 53 cents per share, or $2.12 on
an annual basis.  This figure represents the largest dividend
increase since 1991 from Ameritech or any of the other six
regional Bell companies.  The increase is Ameritech's 12th
consecutive dividend increase in 12 years.

BELL ATLANTIC 'ONE STEP CLOSER' TO COMMERCIAL VDT IN TOMS RIVER

Bell Atlantic last week came "one step closer" to its goal of
delivering video dialtone (VDT) services to consumers in Toms
River.

Spokesman Harry Mitchell tells Telco Business Report the telco
has just completed hooking up the initial 200 customers who will
test the system for six to eight weeks without paying a monthly
fee.  The telco is about one-third of the way to its goal of
passing 38,000 homes with its all-digital network, according to
Mitchell.  Cost of the buildout is $1,700 per home, or $60
million to $70 million.

Although it is rosy about its VDT progress, the telco is seeing
red over the FCC's recent proposal to deregulate incumbent cable
competitor Adelphia Cable's Tier 1 service in Dover Township,
N.J., where Toms River is located, once Bell Atlantic begins to
provide commercial service there.  Several other telcos,
including the U S West, have filed comments with the FCC
regarding the situation.

TELCO PLANS GROWTH VIA NEW RETAIL BUSINESS ALIGNMENT

Southern New England Telephone aims to leverage its line of
products and services via a new retail business alignment that
seeks to provide customers with one-stop shopping for a variety
of needs.

The restructuring will revamp the telco's current structure of
independent business units, which sees each unit having its own
product development, marketing, and sales and advertising
functions.  SNET's retail operation will evolve into four
customer distribution channels and three product groups.

"This new alignment is another step toward offering customers
what they want: one-stop shopping for innovative packages that
ultimately may include a whole array of wireline, wireless,
information and entertainment services," Daniel Miglio, SNET
chairman and CEO, said.

Texas Agency Reconsiders Policy
For Local Exchange Service Resale 

     The Texas Public Utilities Commission has said it is
reconsidering whether to allow companies holding a "service
provider certificate of operating authority" (SPCOA) also to
offer facilities-based local exchange service.  When granting an
SPCOA to MFS Communications Co., Inc., late last year, the PUC
said it was authorizing MFS to provide service both as a reseller
and as a facilities-based provider (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).

     At its meeting last week, however, the PUC delayed action on
Teleport Communications Group, Inc.'s application for an SPCOA. 
The commissioners needed time to reconsider whether SPCOA holders
should be allowed to combine resold and facilities-based service,
a PUC spokeswoman said.

     The Texas Legislature last year passed a telecom competition
law (TCR, May 25, 1995) allowing two types of local exchange
authorization:

(1) SPCOAs, which allow companies to resell services and

(2) "Certificates of operating authority" (COAs), which include
network build-out requirements.

     At last week's meeting two commissioners questioned whether
SPCOA holders should be able to provide services over their own
facilities, the spokeswoman said.  The PUC now will review the
legislative history to determine whether lawmakers meant for
SPCOA holders to provide facilities-based service, and it may
listen to tapes of the legislature discussing the issue, she
said.

     The concerns were triggered, in part, by a letter sent to
commissioners last October by two state legislators, who said the
law was not intended to allow SPCOA holders to provide
facilities-based service, the spokeswoman continued.  "At the
time, the commission didn't agree with the letter," she said. 
"But now [the commissioners] want to review that key piece to
this [issue]."

     The commission will address Teleport's application and the
SPCOA issue at a Jan. 24 meeting.  

     It could approve Teleport's application and allow MFS to
move forward, it could remand the issues to an administrative law
judge, or it could decide to study the matter further itself, the
spokeswoman said.

     J. Manning Lee, Senior Regulatory Counsel for Teleport, said
he was "hopeful" that the commission would stick to its initial
decision, which he said would allow end users to reap the
benefits of competition more quickly.  When MFS was granted an
SPCOA and the PUC said the company could combine resold and
facilities-based services, Teleport abandoned its plan to obtain
a COA and applied for an SPCOA instead.

     The SPCOA already granted to MFS "was not disturbed" by the
PUC's action, said Andrew Lipman, Senior Vice President-legal and
regulatory affairs at MFS.  

     "The PUC held unanimously that we could offer
facilities-based service [when it approved MFS' application]" Mr.
Lipman said.  "We've briefed this issue now eight separate
times."  He said the legislation clearly allows SPCOA holders to
resell services and provide facilities-based services and that
the legislative history will support this view.  

     In any event, legislative intentions "are not supposed to
supersede the actual legislation," Mr. Lipman said.  The
legislation was intended to prevent the largest interexchange
carriers from "taking advantage" of the SPCOA, he added.  "The
entire thrust of the legislation is to encourage infrastructure
development."

     The commission spokeswoman said reconsideration of the
matter is related partially to the PUC's rushed schedule for
considering applications.  The law requires the PUC to make
decisions regarding applications within 60 days of receiving
them, and the PUC had to consider several applications that were
submitted soon after the law passed.  

     Meanwhile, the commission has approved LCI International,
Inc.'s application for an SPCOA.  After it files tariffs and
negotiates pricing arrangements with Southwestern Bell Telephone
Co., LCI wants to bundle interexchange services and resold local
exchange services.  LCI has been authorized to provide local
exchange service to business customers in New York and has
applications pending in Illinois, Michigan (TCR, June 22, 1995),
and California (TCR, Sept. 14, 1995).

CLECs Applaud Arizona Agency Staff's 
Proposed Rules for Interconnection

     The staff of the Arizona Corporation Commission has proposed
rules covering interconnection arrangements between local
exchange carriers (LECs) and competitors, bringing enthusiastic
endorsements from competitive local exchange carriers.  The staff
proposal addresses service unbundling, points of interconnection,
mutual compensation arrangements, and number portability.  It
follows the commission's adoption of guidelines for opening local
exchange and intraLATA markets to competition (TCR, Jan. 5, 1995.
p. 9; and July 6, 1995).

     Public hearings on the staff proposal are expected to begin
in March.  The staff would require incumbent LECs to unbundle
network components "considered essential to the provision of
local exchange service."  A LEC would be required to provide
essential services "on the same terms and conditions that it
provides these facilities and services to itself."  Under the
proposal, essential services and features would include, but not
be limited to, the following:

     *    Termination of local and long distance calls;

     *    Interconnection with "911" services; and

     *    Access to numbering resources, dedicated channel
network access connections, and unbundled loops.

     The staff also would require incumbent LECs to provide
nondiscriminatory access to databases, and a mechanism would be
established for competitors to request that additional network
services or facilities be unbundled.  Incumbents would be
required to file tariffs for those services within 30 days of the
effective date of the rules.

     The prices for interconnection services, including access to
databases and other network functions, would be set at the
total-service long-run incremental cost (TSLRIC).  Incumbents
would be required to provide "floor" calculations for the
services "to ensure the avoidance of anticompetitive pricing
practices," the staff said.  In its retail price for each
service, the incumbent would be required to recover "the TSLRIC
of all nonessential--and the imputed prices of all essential--
services, facilities, components, functions or capabilities
provided, whether offered under a tariff or on a private-contract
basis."

     Local and extended area service traffic would be terminated
on a "mutual traffic exchange" or "bill-and-keep" basis for an
interim period of 36 months, allowing carriers to terminate each
others' traffic at no charge.  Other compensation arrangements
could be negotiated between carriers.  If carriers do not agree
on compensation for terminating calls, each carrier would be
required to file a tariff proposing a permanent compensation plan
within 24 months of the rules' effectiveness.  The staff said
charges outlined in such tariffs should not be usage-sensitive.

     Incumbent LECs and competitive carriers would be directed to
negotiate mutually agreeable interconnection points.  Each
carrier would be responsible for its own facilities to the point
of interconnection.  If an agreement cannot be reached, the party
responding to the request would have to notify the commission and
explain why interconnection at the requested point is impossible.

     The staff also proposed that incumbent LECs make number
portability available on an interim basis using existing services
such as call forwarding.  Carriers would be required to file
interim number portability tariffs within 30 days of approval of
the rules.  The commission staff would be required to recommend a
permanent solution by Jan. 31, 1997.

     U S WEST Communications Co. is challenging the state's
competition rules in court, with cases pending in the Arizona
Superior Court (Maricopa County) and the U.S. District Court for
the District of Arizona.  The federal court has stayed the case
until the state court issues a decision, a U S WEST spokesman
said.  No action has been taken in the state court.  

     The legal challenge encompasses the state's competition
rules in their entirety and would include the current
interconnection rule proposal, the spokesman said.  U S WEST
objects to the lack of evidentiary hearings on competition, and
it specifically opposes the bill-and-keep compensation proposal.

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., applauded the proposal,
particularly the bill-and-keep compensation mechanism. 
"Bill-and-keep is a fair, simple, and competitively neutral
arrangement that enables new local carriers to develop their
networks," said Mike McHale, Teleport's Vice President and
General Manager in Arizona.  But he emphasized that the proposal
requires U S WEST's cooperation in reaching technical
interconnection arrangements.  "We hope U S WEST will be
cooperative in these negotiations," he said.  

     "However, its commitment to competition is questionable
given that it has filed suit against the [commission for its]
pro-competitive rules. . .In that suit, U S WEST claims it has
the right to be the exclusive provider of service for Arizona
customers."

     Meanwhile, Electric Lightwave, Inc., has asked the
commission for authorization to provide a full range of telecom
services.  It plans to provide switched local exchange,
intra-state long distance, and digital point-to-point services at
a variety of speeds, competing "head-to-head" with U S WEST
Communications, Inc., said Brian D. Thomas, ELI's Director-public
policy.

     ELI currently operates a fiber optic network providing
point-to-point, private, high-capacity service in Phoenix, Mr.
Thomas noted.  It probably would offer the new services in
Phoenix initially, with other parts of the state served later, he
added.  Because a state law protects independent telcos from
competition, ELI's application seeks authority to serve only
areas in which U S WEST operates.  The commission is expected to
act on the application in the first half of 1996, ELI said.

CLECs Say 'Phase II' of Md. Competition Rules
Offer 'Favorable' Rates for Interconnection

     In a decision praised immediately by competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commission
has established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions for
carriers planning to compete in the provision of services to
business end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.
8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission said
that "an essential service such as interconnection should not be
priced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commission
are "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlined
terms for offering unbundled network elements, established an
interim local number portability method, and began a separate
proceeding on universal service issues.

     The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the state
in 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application for
permission to provide local exchange service (TCR, May 12, 1994). 
In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, it
established interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensation
for call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland to
interconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem and
central office switching facilities.

     In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantic
had proposed a three-part interconnection rate structure: (1) a
per-minute rate mirroring intrastate, interexchange access
charges, minus the carrier common line charge; (2) a monthly
per-line rate designed to capture the difference between the
revenues received from the per-minute rate and Bell Atlantic's
costs for building a "ubiquitous network" in the state; and (3) a
universal service component to be determined in the universal
service proceeding.

     Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"
should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on the
co-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnection
rates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,
citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitous
network" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier of
last resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all local
exchange service providers be required to charge each other the
same cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued that
establishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient and
would promote fair competition.

     Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," the
commission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection rates
paid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not full
recovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedent
certainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recover
joint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples in
excess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," the
PSC said.  

     It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"
intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data on
traffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specific
interconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.

     The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnection
provided at tandem switching offices, saying that such
interconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted a
rate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection at
Bell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU for
interconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay the
same 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on the
CLEC's networks.

     Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previous
interim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. 
In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companies
have in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnection
but have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating calls
that originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it had
proposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would have
allowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on Bell
Atlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  The
flat-rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' true
cost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport's
proposal, however, noting that most parties preferred an
MOU-based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-rate
arrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commission
said it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based rate
system before reconsidering other rate schemes.

     The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of Bell
Atlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFS
and Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundled
voice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on those
trials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939
and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business links
and services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  The
commission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directing
the telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a rate
structure proposed by the PSC's staff.

     Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be set
at levels that would be less than or equal to the price of
equivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, the
commission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the prices
for unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios between
the direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That will
allow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of the
amount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone service
rates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs to
compete, the PSC reasoned.

     To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlantic
operates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATA
services bundled with local exchange services.  CLECs had
contended that new entrants should be able to offer such service
packages because Bell Atlantic retains significant competitive
advantages over them.  The PSC said new market entrants may
provide interLATA services but cannot package them with local
exchange service until the interLATA line-of-business restriction
on Bell companies is removed.  CLECs were allowed to delay
providing equal access for intraLATA toll calls until Bell
Atlantic is required to do so.

Calif. PUC Proceeds with Local Competition Plans,
Approves Applications for Operating Authority

     The California Public Utilities Commission has taken several
steps toward implementing local exchange competition in the
state.  Late last year the PUC proposed an outline for universal
service support programs that would include a fund accessible to
competitive local exchange carriers serving high-cost areas.  The
commission also approved 31 applications for competitive local
exchange service authority and issued "interim final" rules
allowing facilities-based local exchange competition to begin
Jan. 1.  The rules are "largely the same" as the interim rules
proposed in July, the PUC said (TCR, Aug. 3, 1995).

     The PUC submitted to the state legislature its proposal to
continue supporting universal telephone service as competition
grows in local exchange markets.  If the legislature adopts the
proposal, the commission will finalize by June a definition of
basic service, establish a revenue source for a high-cost subsidy
fund, and identify high-cost areas.  

     The PUC already has proposed to use a "proxy model" as the
starting point for determining the costs of providing basic local
exchange service.  It would use the "Benchmark Cost Model"
submitted by MCI Telecommunications Corp., the NYNEX Corp.
telephone companies, Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc., in
comments filed in the FCC's docket 80-286 joint board proceeding
on universal service programs (TCR, July 20, 1995).

     The commission also would create a "High Cost Voucher Fund"
to subsidize companies serving rural areas.  Customers in those
areas would receive credits on their monthly bills to "keep their
rates affordable no matter which company serving their area they
choose," the commission said.  The credits would equal the
difference between the rate paid by the customer and the cost to
serve that customer.  Companies would have to be willing to serve
all customers in a designated area to receive the subsidy, the
PUC said. 

     The PUC adopted "interim final rules" governing local
exchange competition.  Interim rules had been proposed last July,
and the commission had held hearings and solicited comments
before developing the current rules, said Richard Smith, an
adviser to Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon.  The rules will be in
effect at least through 1996 and may become permanent as of Jan.
1, 1997, he said.  Parties can petition the PUC to change the
rules while they remain in effect on an interim basis, Mr. Smith
said.

     The rules call for interconnection terms to be established
through contracts rather than tariffs.  The PUC "generally will
raise no objections" to interconnection arrangements unless they
are anticompetitive or raise other such concerns, said Mr. Smith. 
A list of "preferred outcomes" drafted by the PUC contains
guidelines for interconnection arrangements.  Those include
recommendations on the proper number of points and locations for
interconnection and the use of one-way and two-way trunking and
signaling protocols, he added.  There would be a "dispute
resolution process" to resolve interconnection problems between
companies.  Incumbent local exchange carriers also are prohibited
from "unilaterally terminating" interconnection with a
competitor, Mr. Smith said.  A "bill-and-keep" scheme will be
used on an interim basis for call-termination compensation, Mr.
Smith added.

     The PUC also approved 31 applications filed by companies
seeking to provide competitive local exchange service in
California, including AT&T Corp., Brooks Fiber Properties,
Electric Lightwave, Inc., ICG Access Services, Inc., MCImetro,
MFS Intelenet of California, Inc., and Teleport Communications
Group, Inc.  The PUC also gave GTE California and Pacific Bell
authority to provide facilities-based local exchange and
intraLATA toll services in each others' service areas beginning
Jan. 1.  A GTE spokesman said his company plans initially to
enter Pacific Bell's service area in Los Angeles and other areas
contiguous to its own service areas. 

     Meanwhile, a PUC administrative law judge has proposed rates
for interim number portability in the state.  Thomas ALJ Pulsifer
said Pacific Bell should be able to charge its competitors'
customers $1.88 per month, plus a one-time fee, to forward calls
through its network.  Pacific Bell had proposed charging
customers $3.25 per month for remote call forwarding.  Mr.
Pulsifer recommended cutting that rate "to reflect a $1.37
disallowance for the avoided retail costs of marketing and
customer service."  He recommended that GTE-California be able to
charge $3.40 monthly. 

     The PUC last year called for incumbent local exchange
carriers to use remote call forwarding or direct inward dialing
technologies as interim number portability solutions while an
industry task force proposes permanent solutions.  Existing
Pacific Bell and GTE tariffed rates for direct inward dialing are
"reasonable" and should remain in place, the ALJ said.  Under the
recommendation, customers could elect to pay either a one-time
fee of $31.75 for each number forwarded or $75.50 for the first
number and $10 for each additional number.  The PUC is expected
to consider the proposal this month, a spokesman said.

Conn. Agency Rejects SNET Cost Studies,
Sets Interim Local Service Resale Rates

     Saying that cost studies filed by the Southern New England
Telephone Co. (SNET) are "faulty," the Connecticut Department of
Public Utility Control has proposed interim rates for SNET's
unbundled network and wholesale basic local exchange service
offerings.  The department rejected SNET's rate proposal, which
in most cases would have set wholesale rates higher than SNET's
retail rates to end users.  It issued the draft interim rates to
prevent further delay of competition, it said.  The department
asked the telco to submit "accurate and complete" cost studies
for use in developing permanent rates.

     SNET filed tariffs last year with the DPUC proposing rates
for unbundled loops and ports and for a wholesale local exchange
service package that competitors could resell.  SNET proposed to
provide unbundled loops and the wholesale service package at
monthly rates that would vary according to four geographic
classifications:  "metro," urban, suburban, and rural.  

     In support of its proposed rates, SNET submitted a series of
cost studies.       The DPUC, however, said SNET's proposed rates
and charges were "set too high and may unduly limit competitive
participation by some competent and capable competitors."  It
found "substantive deficiencies" in SNET's cost studies,
including a failure to provide sufficient documentation and the
use of an improper allocation methodology for hybrid fiber
optic/coaxial cable network costs.

     The proposed interim rates would vary depending on the
geographic location, as SNET had proposed.  The interim wholesale
local exchange service rates for both business and residential
service would range from $12.08 per month in metro areas to
$16.87 in rural areas.  The current monthly rate for residential
local exchange service ranges from $14.53 for service in metro
areas to $11.53 for rural customers.  SNET had proposed wholesale
rates ranging from $15 for metro service up to as high as $26 for
rural service.

     For service to business customers, the current retail rates
range from $31.13 in rural areas to $39.23 for businesses in
metro areas.  SNET had proposed wholesale rates beginning at
$12.50 for metro business service and reaching $23.50 for rural
business service.  Those rates would not have included the $3.50
subscriber line charge that SNET is seeking to levy on
competitive local exchange carriers.

     The draft decision also included proposed interim wholesale
rates for unbundled loops ranging from $10.18 per month for metro
service to $15.33 for suburban service.  SNET had proposed a
range of unbundled loop rates from $12.00 in metro areas to
$22.50 in rural areas.  The current retail rate for unbundled
loops in all four geographic classifications is $22.55, the DPUC
said.  It directed SNET to file a volume discount plan for its
unbundled service offerings.  The interim rates will "encourage
the development of effective competition" and "provide the
necessary incentive to SNET to refile as quickly as possible an
acceptable set of costs and proposals" for permanent rates, the
department said.  Meanwhile, the PUC also released a draft plan
to place SNET under price cap regulation.  SNET requested the
change last March, citing competitive market changes in the
state.  The commission said the plan would give SNET flexibility
to compete effectively with carriers seeking to "cherry-pick" the
most lucrative customers and would reward the company for
reducing costs.

     The plan would categorize SNET services as either
"noncompetitive," "emerging competitive," or "competitive." 
Almost all SNET services would be presumed to be noncompetitive
initially, the PUC said.  The only offerings considered
competitive at the outset would be "800" service, wide-area
telephone service, and Centrex/digital Centrex services.  Those
were deemed competitive by state telecom legislation passed in
1994 (TCR, May 12, 1994).

     Prices for noncompetitive services would be banded; a price
ceiling would be set either at the existing price or, if the
product already is banded, at the existing upper limit of the
band.  The price floor would be based on total-service long-run
incremental costs (TSLRIC).  Basic local exchange services for
residences and businesses would be capped at current rates until
Jan. 1, 1998.

     SNET would be allowed downward pricing flexibility for all
products and would be able to propose service reclassifications. 
Once services are classified as "emerging competitive," they also
would be banded to provide pricing flexibility, the PUC said. 
The price floor for such services would be based on the TSLRIC;
SNET would propose price ceilings when it requests that a service
be reclassified as emerging competitive.  Services considered
competitive would be subject only to a price floor.

AT&T Gets Authority To Provide Local Service
In Chicago; Eyes Md., Conn., Wisc. Markets 

     AT&T Corp. has continued its move into local exchange
service markets, receiving authorization from the Illinois
Commerce Commission to provide local exchange service in the
Chicago LATA late last year.  AT&T also has applied for authority
to provide local exchange service to business and residential
customers in Maryland and Connecticut and said it plans to begin
offering local switched services in Wisconsin later this year.

     The carrier's entry into the Illinois market may be delayed,
however, if Ameritech-Illinois fails to offer reasonable
"wholesale" rates for the local exchange services AT&T plans to
resell, AT&T said.  The company is awaiting commission action on
a request that Ameritech be required to offer wholesale rates
that are "viable for use by resellers."  Ameritech had filed
proposed local exchange service resale tariffs following
agreements with U.S. Network Corp. and MFS Communications Co.,
Inc., to resell its services (TCR, Nov. 9 and Dec. 7, 1995).

     The tariffs feature sliding-scale discounts of 6% for
residential service and 10% for business service--with better
rates available to resellers making certain term and volume
commitments.  AT&T has claimed that Ameritech's proposed resale
tariffs would not allow it to compete effectively.  AT&T is
seeking wholesale rates that are 25% to 35% below the telco's
retail rates for local exchange service.

     Scott Etzler, AT&T Regional Vice President, said,
"Unfortunately, most potential Ameritech competitors have
discovered that being certified to offer local service and
actually providing that service to customers are two very
different things.  Ameritech executives seem to be saying that
they are willing to open their local exchange monopoly to small
competitors, but not those that could really deliver on the
promise of local service competition."  AT&T has yet to receive a
"satisfactory reply" from Ameritech since asking the telco to
develop wholesale rates more than six months ago, Mr. Etzler
said.  

     The delays prompted AT&T last month to ask the Illinois
commission to require Ameritech Corp. to offer local exchange
services to competitors for resale "at prices and terms that will
allow competitors to be successful in the marketplace."  Despite
the certification of six companies as potential competitors in
state, competition in Illinois for residential markets is "nearly
nonexistent," AT&T said.

     Meanwhile, AT&T has asked the Maryland Public Service
Commission for authority to provide local exchange service to
business and residential end users in the state.  AT&T said it
initially would resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's services but
eventually would build its own network, "as market conditions and
opportunities develop."  It hopes to begin offering service by
mid-1996.  

     As expected, AT&T also asked the Connecticut Department of
Public Utility Control for authority to offer local exchange
service in the state.  The carrier announced plans last fall to
enter the state's residential and business local exchange markets
once the PUC established "wholesale" prices for resale of local
exchange service (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The agency last month set
interim rates for the resale of Southern New England Telephone
Co.'s (SNET's) unbundled network and wholesale basic local
exchange offerings (see separate story).

     AT&T is "not completely satisfied" with the interim rates,
however.  A company spokesman said the rates for resale of local
exchange service to business are "conducive to real competition,"
but the residential service rates "represent a barrier to
competitive entry."  He stated that residential resale rates were
set "significantly above [SNET's] retail rate."  

     When the PUC adopted the interim rates, it directed SNET to
conduct new cost studies for the development of permanent resale
rates.  It also told SNET to develop a volume discount plan for
resellers.  Those measurers should improve the prospects for
competition in the state, the AT&T spokesman said.

     The company also announced plans this month to compete in
Wisconsin's local exchange markets, pending the adoption of local
exchange competition rules by that state's Public Service
Commission.  AT&T said it hopes to enter the state's markets by
the middle of this year.  AT&T also offers local exchange service
as part of the "Open Market Plan" in Rochester, N.Y. (TCR, March
16, 1995) and has won authority to provide such service in
Michigan (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).

Telcos Fight Ohio Competition Rules;
Time Warner Seeks Rate Mediation

     Telephone companies in Ohio have continued their fight
against local exchange competition rules adopted in the state
last year (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).  Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.
asked the Ohio Supreme Court late last year to overturn a
decision authorizing Time Warner Communications to provide local
exchange service, contending that the state legislature, not the
PUC, has the authority to allow such competition.  And in
comments on the proposed local competition rules submitted to the
PUC by staff last year, Ameritech-Ohio told the PUC that the
proposal would hurt consumers and provide unfair advantages to
the telco's competitors.

     The PUC last year granted Time Warner Communications a
certificate to provide local exchange service in the 37 Ohio
counties where it operates cable TV systems (TCR, Aug. 31, 1995). 
Cincinnati Bell and other local exchange carriers unsuccessfully
have requested that the PUC reverse its decision to give Time
Warner telephony service authority (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).  

     Cincinnati Bell filed the appeal with the state Supreme
Court, saying it is the "next step" following the PUC's denial of
that request.  State law "clearly spells out the actions which
must be taken when policy changes [occur] that will affect
consumers," said Barbara J. Stonebraker, Senior Vice President of
Cincinnati Bell.

     Ameritech agreed that the proposed local competition rules
are unfair to incumbent local exchange carriers. In comments
filed with the PUC, James C. Smith, Ameritech-Ohio Vice
President-regulatory, said the proposals would "promote the
interests of competitors and make existing telephone companies
and consumers finances [the competitors'] entry into the local
phone business."

     The Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, however, said it
supported the staff's recommendations.  It offered additional
proposals, suggesting that the PUC develop a universal service
support mechanism for carriers providing service in high-cost and
low-income areas.  

     The office also proposed exempting small local exchange
carriers from rules allowing local exchange competition for three
years.  Each competitive local service provider should file
tariffs for "plain old telephone service," it said. 

     Meanwhile, Time Warner has expressed frustration over
Ameritech's intransigence in talks on interconnection issues,
asking the PUC to mediate negotiations.  Time Warner said
"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snag
over "economic" issues.  Time Warner requested PUC mediation in
its second 60-day report to the commission on the status of its
interconnection negotiations with Ameritech and other telephone
companies.

     Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for Time
Warner, said Ameritech appears "unable or unwilling to negotiate"
a reasonable resolution of the remaining issues.  In its request
for mediation, Time Warner said, "Some [Ameritech] charges for
key services, for which there are not current substitutes, are
excessive."  Ameritech also has failed to provide "cost
justifications" and has proposed some one-time charges that are
"not appropriate," Time Warner added.  

     In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by
"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriate
insistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a manner
which insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." 
Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remaining
issues, "if Time Warner is serious."

     Time Warner continued its attack on the telco this week by
asking the PUC to suspend Ameritech's alternative regulation
plan.  It also asked the PUC to order Ameritech to publish a
notice explaining that its alternative regulation has been
suspended.  The order also should compel Ameritech to enter into
an interim interconnection agreement with Time Warner and pay the
PUC's and Time Warner's legal and other expenses incurred in the
dispute, Time Warner said.

Ameritech-Michigan Proposes 
Local Exchange Resale Rates

     Ameritech-Michigan has filed an intrastate tariff proposing
rates for the resale of its local exchange services in Michigan. 
The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,
offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some network
services.  Discounts would vary for different network elements
and services and would increase with volume and term commitments,
an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject to
PSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.

     Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting the
requirements of the recently passed Michigan Telecommunications
Act (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%
wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. 
Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on local
usage rates for residential services and 11% discount on local
usage rates for business services.  The discount rate for
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services would
be 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritech
spokeswoman said.  Competitors also would be able to purchase for
resale such enhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, as
well as advanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN
(integrated services digital network) offerings.

TRA Official Heralds Resellers' Entry into Local
Markets, Sees Potential for Alliances with CLECs

     Until now, members of the Telecommunications Resellers
Association have been identified as either facilities-based or
"switchless" resellers of interexchange services.  But those
companies now appear poised to bring their experience to bear on
local exchange markets, joining facilities-based competitive
local exchange carriers (CLECs), cable TV companies, and large
interexchange carriers (IXCs) as potential competitors to
incumbent telephone companies.  TRA recently formed a committee
to help members explore local exchange market entry, and several
CLECs have joined the association.  TRA Executive Director Ernest
B. Kelly III recently spoke with TCR about the effect his group's
members may have on growing local exchange service competition.

     TCR:  Until now TRA has represented companies that resell
interexchange services--the only services really available for
resale, in practical terms.  What percentage of your members are
interested in entering local exchange resale markets?

     Kelly:  We've done surveys on that and found that it's
virtually 100%.  Companies that are in for the long haul. . .
realize that eventually, they're going to have to have a bundled
set of services.  And local telephone services are the key, the
linchpin, in taking the services they already are providing to
the next level.  

     [They are the key] to surviving the coming [market] changes. 
So our panel sessions that we do at our conferences, our local
resale council that we created--these are matters of tremendous
interest within TRA.  In sum, there's a lot of interest from our
members in knowing how and when they can offer local services.

     TCR:  Is local exchange resale fundamentally the same as
long distance resale in terms of reaching agreements with
underlying carriers?  Are experienced resellers--your members--
going to have an operational edge in reselling local exchange
services?

     Kelly:  Good questions.  In theory the relationship between
the underlying carrier and the reseller ought to be pretty much
the same.  In terms of what's going to happen in the real world,
in the world of practical experience, it's impossible to say for
sure because there's so little reselling of local services going
on right now.  We don't have any real basis on which to
[identify] any kind of trend, track record, or anything else. 
We'll just have to see.

     My guess is that there are going to be differences.  For one
thing, you're dealing with the question of universal service, and
we're not exactly sure how that's going to play out. . .So there
are a lot of subtle differences.  But the basic relationship
ought to be pretty much the same.  Hopefully there will enough
competition in local [exchange markets for] certain competitors
to want to utilize the resources of resellers.  

     Consider that resellers, which have been successful in the
long distance market, bring to the partnership an established
track record and an established customer base.  And those
customers are used to getting service from an alternative
supplier.  So you've knocked off a couple of the big [marketing]
impediments immediately because you've got a customer base that's
sophisticated in the world of resale and apparently has been
satisfied.

     It all really depends on whether the underlying carriers
view this as a true partnership with resellers--which is what we
would advocate--or whether they view it as a mandatory obligation
under certain rules and regulations established by the
government. . .In that case, you're going to have some problems.

     TCR:  That gets to my next question.  Relationships between
AT&T Corp. and some resellers have not always been cordial. 
There have been disputes and sometimes litigation.  Can we expect
to see a similarly rocky start to local exchange service resale?

     Kelly:  Let's get back to the point I just made.  If the
underlying carriers look at the relationship as a true
partnership, I think you'll see that harmonious relationships
will develop.  If they see it as some obligation they are
required to perform against their wishes or against their better
judgments, then you're going to have problems, because they won't
be working in consort with the reseller.  You know, an underlying
carrier has to look at a reseller as a partner, not as a
competitor. . .The ones that have done that have developed very
successful relationships with resellers. . .

     TCR:  I guess it depends on whether you view a reseller as
an alternative sales force that will generate revenues or as
somebody who's going to cut into your market share.

     Kelly:  In the case of AT&T [Corp.], at the time [of
divestiture], they had virtually the entire market.  For them,
I'm sure that resellers and other competitors simply represented
lost market share more than anything else.  That may be at the
heart of some of the problems.  

     The concern we have, I guess, is that the Bell companies are
going to have some of the same feelings or concerns and will not
want to work harmoniously with resellers.

     They'll service resellers, but they may not want to look at
them [as partners], which is what I'm advocating, and what our
association is really all about. . .On the other hand, they may
have seen that the problems that existed with some of AT&T's
resellers are problems that can be avoided if they take a true
partnership approach.

     TCR:  How necessary is local exchange competition for the
development of competition, overall?  How do you counter
arguments that only facilities-based competition will lead to a
true breakup of local exchange carriers' monopolies?

     Kelly:  Resale is going to be absolutely critical to the
initial surge of competition because it's going to take time,
money, and resources to develop competitive infrastructures. 
What the CAPs [competitive access providers] have out there right
now is great but it is just a scratch on the surface.  There's a
long, long way to go, and it's not going to happen over- night. 
We know that.

     On the other hand, I am one of those who believe that true
resale will flourish in the future only when we have ubiquitous,
competing, facilities-based companies out there.  That's when it
really will take off.  If you look at the experience gained from
the long distance market, AT&T initially offered resale at the
behest of the government. . .But it didn't really explode until
[WilTel, Inc.,] and [Sprint Communications Co. L.P.]--Sprint in
particular--laid down fiber optic cables with an abundance of
capacity.  

     That really required them, as a matter of business, to look
at alternative channels for marketing and sales.  That's where
the kick came.  And the same thing is going to happen in local
exchange markets, particularly for companies who are competing
against the entrenched former monopolists in the LEC [local
exchange carrier] community.

     TCR:  You've written articles on the potential for alliances
to be formed among CLECs and resellers.  Could you outline the
synergies between those companies?  How can resellers help the
CLECs or CAPs gain stronger positions in local exchange markets?

     Kelly:  I'm very much interested in forging a strong
relationship between our member companies and the competitive
local exchange carriers.  We're pleased to see that a number of
the CAPs, including some of the bigger ones, have joined TRA and
have now taken positions of leadership within our local resale
council.  We think it's absolutely essential that the CAPs take a
look at how they can utilize resellers.  

     I've described in some of our discussions here the kind of
synergies that naturally exist.  If you're a CAP with a
reasonably good system. . .of fiber rings around the country, you
can begin to look at resellers as a form of marketing and sales
[force] that can give you a quick shot at market share.

     Resellers reach into every nook and cranny in the U.S.  They
are more ubiquitous in terms of marketing and sales forces than
any of the CAPs are right now.  It only makes sense to
investigate thoroughly how these dynamic, entrepreneurial groups
can work together.  And that's what we're trying to do within
TRA.  We think those synergies will only increase, and I'm
beginning to see most of the CAPs recognizing that there's
potential here.  And that's very encouraging.

     TCR:  There's been a widely publicized debate over what
"wholesale" rate LECs should be allowed to charge for services
offered for resale.  AT&T is favoring something like a 30%
discount while most of the LECs are trying to hold it at
something less than 10%.  In your view, which position is more
economically defensible?

     Kelly:  Well, I'd rather come at that in a different way. 
First we want to see true cost-based approaches to ascertaining
what the cost of basic service should be.  There are a number of
different wholesale approaches that then can be taken.  In the
long distance industry, as you probably know, we have discounts
of up to 30% to 50%, depending on the volume and the kind of term
commitment you're willing to make.  The difficult thing here is
the question of universal service--how it will be funded and the
impact it will have on establishing some sort of true, cost-based
approach.

     I think any number of different wholesale approaches could
work, but we first have to get to what true cost-based pricing
is.  Our initial cut on that is that [the costs] probably are
going to be less than what the Bell companies are claiming at
this point.  If we can just tear aside the underbrush and get to
the true cost of providing local service, then we can at that
point begin to consider different wholesale or discount packages. 
That's what we're trying to accomplish.  I don't know how long
it's going to take; it's going to be different in every state and
region.  We'll just have to see whether that turns out to be one
of the big fights.  My guess is that it will be.

     TCR:  Has TRA taken a position--or what's your opinion--on
what costs or overhead factors should be included by LECs in
calculating wholesale rates?

     Kelly:  We've made any number of filings. . .in virtually
every state on this issue.  Obviously we've taken positions in
federal government proceedings--before the Congress, the
Commission, etc.  We're trying not to pick one approach over
another.  A number of the larger interexchange carriers have
suggested some good approaches to all this. . .A few key states
are going to lead the way on this--California, New York, and
Illinois come to mind. . .I think it's a little too early in the
process to say, "This is going to work and that's not going to
work."  I think flexibility right now is the best approach we
could take.

     TCR:  How would resale develop under terms currently
contained in the pending federal telecom legislation?  More
specifically, does the measure still contain a provision that
would hinder the ability of interexchange carriers to offer
bundled packages of long distance and resold local exchange
services?

      Kelly:  Bundled and unbundled [services] are addressed in
the legislation. . .Of course, since they still haven't passed
it, anything could change.  It doesn't matter if somebody says,
"We're only looking at certain parts of the bill affecting
broadcasting," if the bill is not put to bed, all provisions in
it are probably open to mischief.  So all of this has to have a
big asterisk next to it because what we've seen to date may not
be the end result.

     The resale language is OK.  We wanted some stronger resale
language in the legislation because we knew that  resale would be
the first place where competition would really take off.  I was
pleased, frankly, to see that resale has now become item number
one on the "competitive checklist."  

     It was always in the bill, but now it's a part of the
checklist, [meaning that] there have to be resale products--and
no impediments to resale--as a condition of the LECs' getting
into the [interLATA] long distance business.  That's good. 
That's very positive.

     TCR:  How about the joint-marketing provision?

     Kelly:  From TRA's perspective, 98% of the companies in our
association are going to be allowed to joint market because
they're not at the 5% threshold.  That was devised to keep AT&T,
MCI [Telecommunications Corp.] and Sprint from being able to come
out and joint market before the [Bell companies] were able to
joint market.  I don't see that prohibition applying to much of
our membership, which consists of small resellers with minimal
overall market share.

FCC Price Cap Changes Improperly Set
Rates 'Retroactively,' LECs Tell Court

     In setting "interim" price cap rules governing local
exchange carriers (LECs), the FCC "gerrymandered" the available
data on LEC earnings to support its own conclusion that
interstate access rates should be reduced, LECs have told a
federal court.  In oral arguments before the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, attorneys said the Commission failed to
explain its actions last year setting new price cap "productivity
factors" and requiring LECs to "add back" the effect of previous
years' earnings "sharing" obligations (TCR, April 13, 1995).  The
FCC also erred by making its actions apply retroactively, they
added.

     Attorneys for the FCC and AT&T Corp. countered that the
agency had used its authority properly to establish rate-setting
mechanisms.  They said the rule changes applied only to LEC price
cap calculations for this year onward.

     Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies, et al., v. FCC
(consolidated cases beginning at no. 95-1217) stemmed from the
Commission's first order in the docket 94-1 LEC price cap
performance review proceeding.  Finding that it had made an error
in setting the original productivity factors (3.3% and 4.3%) in
1990, the Commission "reinitialized" the factors and required
LECs to make a one-time, downward correction in their price cap
indices for each year they had chosen the 3.3% factor.  

     The Commission also established, on an "interim" basis, new
productivity factors ranging from 4.0% to 5.3%.  The FCC since
has adopted a rulemaking notice seeking comments on the proper
methodology for setting "permanent" productivity factors.

     In its order, the FCC also altered the price cap rules'
definition of "exogenous" costs, ruling that LECs could include
in price cap calculations only those exogenous costs that
represent true "economic costs."  That ruling excluded exogenous
costs stemming from accounting changes to implement Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (post-employment benefits
or "OPEBs").  

     And in a separate order in docket 93-179, the Commission
ordered LECs to "add back" the effects of sharing obligations
incurred in previous years when they calculate current-year rates
of return.  The add-back rule also was applied to LEC "lower-end
adjustments" under the price cap rules.

     During the oral argument, the judges--Laurence H. Silberman,
James L. Buckley, and A. Raymond Randolph--viewed the LECs'
arguments with some skepticism.  Attorney Mark L. Evans,
representing the LECs on productivity factor and OPEBs issues,
said his clients object to the FCC's "cooking the books"--
selecting only data supporting its preconceived view.

     When it initiated the docket 94-1 price cap proceeding, the
Commission had pledged to weigh all available data concerning the
LECs' performance under the price cap rules, he said.  But in
considering productivity factors, it ignored data submitted by
the U.S. Telephone Association concerning the LECs' economic
performance during 1991 and 1992.  "The data didn't support the
conclusion it wanted," Mr. Evans said.  So "the FCC set about to
gerrymander the data to fit its conclusion."

     Mr. Evans said it was unreasonable for the agency not to
include in its consideration of the interim figures all relevant
data available--including the 1991-1992 data, "which the
Commission pretends doesn't exist."  He added that the FCC, while
disregarding that data, relied in part on new data to reach the
conclusion that the original productivity factors had been set
erroneously in 1990.  

     Judge Buckley recalled the FCC's conclusion that it should
not use the 1991-1992 data because that data had been received
with ex parte comments in docket 94-1.  The agency felt it could
not use the data without obtaining additional public comment. 
Mr. Evans said that rationale was spelled out only in the FCC's
brief in the case, not in its docket 94-1 order.  

LECs Say Add-Back Rule Was Adopted Improperly

     Representing LECs that appealed the add-back order, Paul T.
Cappuccio said the FCC "must explain the necessity for the
add-back rule in light of its statutory authority."  Those LECs
had argued that the new rule made revenue-sharing similar to a
"refund" ordered under rate-of-return regulation, although the
Communications Act allows refunds only if rates have been found
"unlawful."  Under the price cap rules, LEC rates are not held to
be unlawful even if the companies' earnings exceed the sharing
threshold, the LECs had pointed out.

     Mr. Cappuccio told the court that the FCC had failed to
explain why it implemented sharing initially without an add-back
mechanism and then reversed course and adopted the add-back rule. 
Judge Silberman asked, "Suppose the Commission interpreted the
prior sharing rule to say that it already required an add-back
process?"  In that case, the judge added, the FCC would not have
to adopt a new rule; it could merely clarify that its existing
rule required the add-back methodology. 

     The earnings "sharing" rule requires LECs earning above a
certain threshold to share part or all of their earnings with
ratepayers in the form of lowered price cap indices (PCIs) in the
following year.  

     The add-back rule requires that LECs reverse the effect of
that sharing when calculating earnings for the second year.  A
similar rule applies to the "low-end adjustment," which allows
LECs to raise their PCIs if they have earned below a certain rate
of return.

     The add-back rule effectively penalizes LECs twice for
earning above the sharing threshold, Mr. Cappuccio said.  Not
only must LECs incur sharing obligations, he said, but the
negative effects of those obligations are perpetuated in future
years. 

FCC Had Warned of Price Cap Changes, Ingle Says

     Addressing the productivity factor issue, FCC attorney John
Ingle recalled that when it implemented the price cap plan in
1990, the FCC had promised to review the rules after four years. 
It did so partly out of concern over whether the proper
productivity factors had been established, he said.  Judge
Silberman asked whether the LECs could have been allowed to
present "economic earnings" data to supplement the "accounting"
rate-of-return data the agency used to calculate productivity
offsets.  Mr. Ingle said such data may have been included in the
1991-1992 information submitted by USTA.

     He disagreed with Mr. Evans' view that the FCC simply had
ignored that data.  "I think the Commission was very receptive to
much of the data and the methodology USTA was suggesting," he
said.  But because the data was submitted only a few weeks before
the order was adopted, the FCC did not have time to make certain
that the data was reliable enough to be incorporated into the
order.  It did not rule out use of the data--or USTA's proposed
methodology for deriving productivity factors--in future orders
in the proceeding, Mr. Ingle said.  The FCC simply decided that
it should seek further comment on them first.

     Addressing the add-back issue, Mr. Ingle explained that
earnings sharing differs from rate refunds under rate-of-return
regulation.  Judge Silberman sought to clarify that sharing does
not directly require LECs to reduce rates, but only to lower
PCIs.  

     So to the extent that LEC rates are below the price cap
ceilings, sharing would not have any real effect on them, he
said.  "You could go for five years without any change in dollar
figures," the judge said.  "Why isn't the Commission making this
argument?" he asked.

     Representing AT&T Corp., Gene C. Schaerr argued that the FCC
had the right to adopt the add-back mechanism as an "accounting
function" that corrects "distortions" caused by the sharing
rules.  He termed "voodoo accounting" the LECs' argument that
they are somehow doubly penalized under the add-back rule.  Judge
Silberman asked, "Isn't it a fact that the Commission is mixing
earnings and revenues?  Isn't that the core issue?"

     Mr. Schaerr compared the LECs to a hypothetical government
employee who finds he has not had enough income withheld during
1994 for income taxes.  The employee then convinces the IRS to
simply deduct the amount due from his paycheck during 1995. 
Then, when it comes time to calculate his total income for that
year, the employee claims that the amount deducted should not be
included as income "because he didn't actually receive the cash,"
Mr. Schaerr said.

     He disputed the LECs' argument that the FCC had engaged in
retroactive ratemaking in altering the price cap rules.  The LECs
are merely attempting to expand the range of rate-setting actions
that courts will regard as retroactive, he said.  But Judge
Silberman countered with his own hypothetical situation. 
"Suppose Congress passed a tax law that says, `If you sold a
house in the past five years, your. . .income tax rate will go
up,'" he said.  Mr. Schaerr said that would be improperly
retroactive.  "But I'm following exactly your framework for
retroactivity," Judge Silberman said.

     Speaking to reporters after the oral argument, Mary
McDermott, Vice President-legal and regulatory affairs for USTA,
said the FCC's action clearly had retroactive effects.  She noted
that the decision to implement the one-time "reinitialization" of
price caps applied only to LECs that had chosen a 3.3%
productivity factor in any of the years from 1991 to 1994.  As a
result of that reinitialization, the LECs had to reduce their
access charges by about $400 million--purely as a result of
choices they had made before the FCC's order, she said.  The LECs
could not have known during those years that their decisions
would lead to rate reductions, she added.

TEXAS RULES

     The Texas Public Utility Commission has adopted an initial
set of rules implementing telecom legislation enacted in the
state last year (TCR, March 16, 1995; April 27, 1995; and May 25,
1995).  

     Included in the rules adopted last month are provisions
requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to provide
directories and directory listings for customers of competitive
local service providers.  

     The rule allows individual companies to negotiate the
pricing for such offerings.  It also issued rules implementing
the legislature's mandate to deregulate telephone cooperatives
and grant small local exchange carriers regulatory flexibility.

ARIZONA AUTHORIZES IntraLATA TOLL CARRIERS

     The Arizona Corporation Commission has approved applications
by AT&T Corp. and MCI Telecommunications Corp. for authority to
provide intraLATA toll service in competition with local exchange
carriers.  The commission also adopted rules requiring LECs to
implement intraLATA equal access by April 20.  Until then,
callers must use "dial-around" access codes to place toll calls
using AT&T's or MCI's networks.

     The commission said Sprint Communications Co. L.P.'s
application for intraLATA toll service authority remains pending,
and other applications are expected.  The decision followed the
commission's approval last year of rules allowing new market
entrants to compete in Arizona's local exchange and intraLATA
toll service markets (TCR, July 6, 1995).

N.J. PROCEEDING

     The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has opened a
proceeding to investigate allowing local exchange competition in
the state and proposed rules to allow intraLATA toll
presubscription.  

     IntraLATA toll competition has been allowed in the state
since 1994, but users have been required to dial access codes to
reach their preferred service provider.  

     The board proposed rules for intraLATA pre-subscription
because "we believe that having to dial a five-digit code does
not assure effective competition," said BPU President Herbert H.

     The Nebraska Public Service Commission has begun a
rulemaking proceeding to allow local exchange competition in the
state by July 1, 1997.  Hearings have been scheduled for early
next year on how to implement competition rules.  

     The PSC has proposed that several "preconditions" be met
before local exchange markets are made competitive.  Those
include providing service at a reasonable price, providing
intraLATA equal access, providing local number portability, and
ensuring universal service.  The commission plans to allow

CALIFORNIA COMPLAINT

     A coalition of local exchange competitors has filed a
complaint urging the California Public Utilities Commission to
reject parts of a recent interconnection agreement between
Pacific Bell and MFS Communications Co., Inc. (TCR, Nov. 23,
1995).  

     The California Telecommunications Coalition--which includes
AT&T Corp., MCI Telecommunications Corp., and Teleport
Communications Group, Inc.--told the PUC that the pact will set
an inappropriate precedent for other interconnection agreements
because MFS plans to serve only business users.  

     Pacific Bell also may attempt to use the agreement to show
that it has met a precondition for entry into the interLATA
service market, the coalition said.

FLORIDA PSC APPROVES NUMBER PORTABILITY PLAN

     The Florida Public Service Commission has approved a plan to
use remote call forwarding as an interim mechanism to provide
local number portability beginning Jan. 1.  Competitors must pay
incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) a nonrecurring charge of
$10 and a recurring charge of $1 per month per line for the
service.  Additional paths cost 50 cents per month, the PSC said. 
The commission said LECs also can provide interim number
portability through a "flexible direct inward dialing" system if
interconnecting competitors prefer.  

     The PSC rejected calls by incumbent LECs to implement an
interim universal service system for the state.  A commission
spokeswoman said, however, that LECs can petition the PSC for
relief from universal service obligations if they show that
competition had "eroded their ability" to meet those obligations.

PART 69 WAIVER

     AT&T Corp. has asked the FCC to approve conditionally
Pacific Bell's request for a waiver of the Commission's part 69
access charge rules to bill end-user common line (EUCL) and
presubscription-change charges to competitive carriers.  

     AT&T asked that Pacific Bell be required to adhere to its
stated plan to charge resellers an EUCL rate that would vary
according to the re-sellers' different end users.  

     Pacific Bell also should not be allowed to "double recover"
local loop costs by recovering the same costs in both intrastate
and interstate charges, AT&T said.

MFS SEEKS RULING ON INTERCONNECTION 

     MFS Communications Co., Inc., has asked the FCC to require
local exchange carriers (LECs) to allow interconnection for
Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), interoffice mileage, and
"Type 2" cellular services.  In a petition for declaratory
ruling, MFS also asked the agency to require LECs to offer
"cross-connects to all of the LECs' other access services upon
bona fide requests."      MFS said several LECs have rejected
requests to offer cross-connects for additional LEC services,
making the interconnection process "unduly burdensome."

     In comments on the petition, MCI Telecommunications Corp.
backed the MFS request.  But in its comments, GTE Corp. told the
FCC that granting the petition would "grant MFS access to prices
for call termination or originating access below" those outlined
in the part 69 access charge rules.

WISCONSIN PSC CHAIRMAN ELECTED NARUC PRESIDENT

Cheryl L. Parrino, chairman of the Public Service Commission
of Wisconsin (PSC) was elected president of the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) at the
organization's annual meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana.

NARUC is a quasi-governmental nonprofit organization founded
over 100 years ago to serve the public interest by improving
the quality and effectiveness of public regulation in America.
Its membership is comprised of government agencies of 50
states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
Virgin Islands. In her acceptance speech before NARUC members,

Chairman Parrino shared her goals for the organization and
outlined the major issues she believes are common to all
utility industries. She also indicated that she felt NARUC is
at a critical point in its 107-year history.

"The telecommunications industry is on the verge of the first
major legislative change in 30 years. I predict we will see
legislation pass this year or early next year. The Safe Water
Drinking Act, PURPA and PUCHA repeal or reform are all matters
currently under discussion. We must be involved if we are to
live up to our motto -- dedicated to the public interest,
Chairman Parrino said. "I commit that NARUC will be a viable
and valuable player in those discussions and that we will have
an impact on how the industries transition to a competitive
market place," she added.

CPUC INVESTIGATES WILTEL FOR CALLER ID PRACTICES

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has opened
an investigation of Wiltel Telephone Corporation (Wiltel) for
allegedly releasing phone numbers of California callers to
out-of-state parties without notice or blocking, a violation
of CPUC and federal Caller ID regulations.

The Commission told Wiltel, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company,
it has 30 days to notify its customers that their billing
numbers are being disclosed in interstate calls. The notice
must be separate from the customer's bills and by first class
mail.  Wiltel must submit within 45 days a report to the CPUC
detailing numbers of customers, volume of intrastate and
interstate calls, and names of all resellers of Wiltel service
in the state.

If the company is found to have violated CPUC regulations, it
could face monetary penalties.

Specifically, Wiltel has been passing on billing numbers, but
for residential customers these are usually the same as the
home number, although they often differ for business lines. In
either case, Wiltel's California subscribers, many of them
with unlisted  numbers, do not know that their numbers are
being disclosed on the other end of a long distance call.

The problem was revealed in late 1994 when two California
customers complained to the Commission. While local phone
companies do not provide Caller ID, that is, allow a called
party to see the number of the person calling, billing numbers
are forwarded to the long distance phone companies and to
subscribers of 800 and 900 services for billing and routing
purposes.

OPEN DEVELOPMENT INTRODUCES PREPAID CALLING CARD
SYSTEM SUPPORTING MORE THAN 100 MILLION ACCOUNTS

Open Client/Server-Based Prepaid Calling Card System Brings
Customized Service Capabilities to RBOCs and Interexchange
Carriers

Open Development Corporation, of Westwood, MA, developers and
marketers of software and services to telecommunications
companies, has introduced openMEDIA Prepaid, a network-based
prepaid calling card system designed to handle over 100
million accounts and support more administrative features than
any other prepaid system in the industry.  openMEDIA Prepaid,
which is marketed to service providers, can easily process 20
million call minutes per month.

openMEDIA Prepaid provides many advanced administrative and
performance features required to provide fast, reliable
prepaid service. These features include fraud control,
multiple reseller and rating plan support, call branding and
activation of cards and lots through IVR (interactive voice
response), as well as the ability to handle large call volumes
associated with millions of accounts. In addition, openMEDIA
Prepaid handles administration, billing and customer care
functions using Windows-based applications.

"Using our openMEDIA Prepaid system, service providers can
deliver reliable, high-volume phone service 24 hours, seven
days a week," said Jeff Laughlin, vice president of marketing.
"Our system is designed for maximum performance and
reliability. The use of industry-standard hardware and
software guarantees system flexibility and scaleability so our
customers can quickly respond and adapt to new market demands
now and into the future. "

Prepaid phone cards let users make calls easily without a
phone company account, allow the use of pay phones without
coins, and are cost-effective because there are no surcharges
or operator assist charges. For businesses, prepaid phone
cards make it easier to track expenses and can be used as
promotional items and giveaways. Yankee Group analysts expect
prepaid phone cards to represent a $1 billion market by the
end of 1996. "We use Open Development is openMEDIA Prepaid
phone card system for our standard retail offering as well as
our NFL "Let's Talk Football" sweepstakes promotion because it
is the most available, scaleable and reliable system we've
seen to date," said Gordon Allen, president of GTE Card
Services. "The system's database implementation enables us to
easily and efficiently manage account transaction processing
and card distribution," added Allen.

openMEDIA Prepaid is designed to be a reseller platform.  It
offers a hierarchical database of agents, subagents, lots and
cards, making it easy to set up new business partners, create
special promotions and generate hundreds of thousands of cards
in a matter of minutes. In addition, it provides the options
necessary to support one or more resellers. Each reseller, in
turn, can set up a number of prepaid phone card campaigns.

openMEDIA Prepaid is the first application to be fully
integrated on openMEDIA, Open Development's robust, open
client/server-based Enhanced Services Platform (ESP).
openMEDIA is a core foundation from which all applications
can run and share platform resources. The platform is built on
a fully integrated Oracle 7 database, PowerBuilder front-end
applications, IBM RS/6000 or Stratus Continuum processors, a
Summa Four or Excel Switch, Dialogic-based voice response
units and a voice recognition option.

The use of the Oracle 7 Relational Database Management System
(RDBMS) and the Oracle Parallel Server option ensures database
integrity and system scaleability. The platform also offers an
integrated client/server database, a real-time billing and
rating engine, and integrated ACD for customer care, IVR for
service creation environment, and is sold in a fault tolerant
and highly available configuration.

Prices for openMEDIA Prepaid start at $150,000. A standard
package includes all hardware, software, the VRU switch and
the CPU. openMEDIA Prepaid is available immediately directly

solutions to telecommunications companies worldwide. The
company is recognized as an industry leader in highly
available, large network-based enhanced service platforms and
prepaid phone card systems. Founded in 1992, Open Development

COMPUTER DATA PROTECTOR AND TELEPHONE
PRIVACY DEVICE INTRODUCED

Are there interruptions from coworkers or family members
picking up the telephone when you are dialed into your
favorite on-line service or cruising the INTERNET? Ever wonder
if someone else is listening in on your telephone
conversation?

If these are problems you are experiencing because of a shared
telephone line, Dalco Products has the answer without the
need of installing a dedicated line. Just place one of their
Data Protector line cords on the extensions that are causing
the interruptions.

Any device equipped with the Data Protector cannot access or
interrupt a line that is already in use. This prevents devices
on the same line from causing interruptions when downloading
files, and eavesdropping on calls already in progress. This is
an ideal device for the home office or anyplace where line
privacy is required.

Installation is simple. Just swap out your existing modular
telephone cord with the Data Protector cord. An in-line
coupler is provided if you need additional length in your
installation. Retail price is $16.95 each with discounts when
purchasing 3 or more devices.

Dealer inquiries are welcomed. For more information, contact
Dalco Products 200 West Main, Roberts, WI 54023. Phone
(715)749-0160 or Fax (715)749-3960.

NEW AMERITECH PAGING SERVICE BOOMING
IN CHICAGO AND ROLLS OUT IN DETROIT

Success of a new paging service from Ameritech, Calling Party
Pays - Paging (CPPP), has been so good in Chicago that
SourceOne Wireless is rolling out the service in Detroit under
their brand name, "FREEDOMPage."

Ameritech developed the Calling Party Pays - Paging service
and currently is the only company offering it in the U.S. As
the first CPPP customer, SourceOne Wireless earned $45,000
from Ameritech in usage fees generated during the audit period
the service was available in the Chicago market.

"This breakthrough technology now allows us to offer a paging
service to people who would not have considered one
previously. We particularly see interest among working parents
with school children to check on them, adults caring for
elderly parents and small business and trades business
people," said Neil Cox, president of Ameritech Information
Industry Services.

A CPPP subscriber no longer pays for incoming calls -- the
caller pays. The only cost for the paging subscriber is
purchasing a pager or converting a current one and the
activation fee, which means no monthly service fee for the
subscriber. Callers to a paging number are given a voice
announcement describing the service fee before the call is
connected. The caller has the option to hang up or complete
the call. The fee is determined by the third-party paging
provider offering the service, but usually runs a flat rate of
25 cents per call.

CPPP was tariffed in Illinois last August after a trial that
ran in Chicago since May. "Since then, 600,000 calls a month
are being processed and new subscribers are being added at the
rate of 15,000 per month," Cox said.

"We are extremely optimistic about FREEDOMPage in Detroit,"
said Dave Trop, chief executive officer of SourceOne Wireless.
"Our results to date in Chicago are well above expectations,
and we anticipate this service to be as successful as our
traditional paging services."

Ameritech is now accepting orders from Michigan, Ohio and
Wisconsin and expects to be accepting orders throughout
Indiana soon. The company also is exploring opportunities
outside the region.

Calling Party Pays (CPP) is built off the Advanced
Intelligent Network (AIN), the most advanced AIN platform
available today and the basis of many new enhanced services.
Other CPP product enhancements off the AIN platform are in
development, and Ameritech is offering technological and
marketing consulting services on CPPP to other companies,
according to Roger Sosa, CPP product manager.

WISCONSIN PSC APPROVES NEW RATE STRUCTURE (ALREADY IN PLACE)

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has reviewed the
record of the Utelco, Inc., rate restructuring proposal and
approved it at an open meeting. Utelco is a Monroe-based
telecommunications company that provides service to
approximately 12,500 customers in eight exchanges in the
Monroe area.

On December 29, 1994, Utelco implemented, subject to a refund
pending PSC review, a new rate structure that charges for
local telephone calls on a per minute basis. The Commission
received three petitions containing 1,258 signatures
requesting that it investigate the proposal, and conduct a
public hearing to determine if the Utelco proposal was in the
public interest.

Two public hearings were held in Monroe on September 25,
1995. At the hearings, 287 appearance slips were submitted by
individual Utelco customers and 206, or 72 percent of the
appearances, indicated they supported the Utelco proposal. In
addition, 46 Utelco customers testified both in support and in
opposition to the proposal.

The Commission found that Utelco residential customers
averaged approximately $8.53 in usage charges for the first
six months of 1995, and that 72 percent of the residential
customers were saving money under the Utelco plan.

GTE CARD SERVICES KICKS OFF FOOTBALL
SWEEPSTAKES USING NFL GTE PREPAID PHONE CARDS

Open Development's openMEDIA Prepaid Application Tackles Call
Management and Contest Administration

GTE Card Services Incorporated, which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of GTE Information Services Incorporated, and Open
Development Corporation, a software developer for
telecommunications service providers, announced a nationwide
football sweepstakes to promote "Let's Talk Football" NFL GTE
Prepaid Phone Cards.

GTE's Prepaid phone card and the administration of the
consumer contest are both automated by openMEDIA Prepaid, a
new prepaid calling card system built for high-volume
applications by Open Development. Open Development's openMEDIA
Prepaid system allows RBOCs and high-volume interexchange
carriers to offer reliable processing of debit calling-card
service.

GTE Card Services is sponsoring the "Let's Talk Football"
sweepstakes, which runs through December 31, 1995, to promote
its officially licensed NFL GTE Prepaid Phone Cards. The cards
feature officially licensed helmets and team logos from all 30
NFL franchises. They are sold in retail locations nationwide
in $10 denominations.

"We've been extremely pleased with the performance of our
prepaid business," said Gordon Allen, president, GTE Card
Services. "Due to significant growth in the prepaid phone card
market, our sweepstakes program has doubled in size. The
scaleability of Open Development's architecture has allowed
us to respond efficiently to this increased demand.

openMEDIA Prepaid offers service providers sophisticated
administrative features such as fraud control, multiple
reseller and rating plan support, call branding and
interactive voice response activation of cards and lots. The
application can handle millions of accounts and performs
administration, billing and customer service functions using
Windows-based applications. The system also tracks the sale
and usage of each card issued, which helps retailers determine
the effectiveness of their marketing strategies.

With the help of features built into the openMEDIA Prepaid
application, consumers can determine over the telephone,
without speaking with a contest representative, whether they
have won a sweepstakes prize. Consumers can call an 800 number
and enter their unique personal identification PIN, found on
the back of the card, to determine whether they have a winning
card. Prizes include official NFL merchandise, GTE Prepaid
Phone Cards featuring NFL teams, and a grand prize that
includes a trip for two to Super Bowl XXX in Phoenix, Ariz.

"We did an extensive market study and found that Open
Development's combination of availability, scaleability and
reliability are far superior to any other calling card
technologies," added GTE's Gordon Allen. "Open Development's
flexible database technology greatly simplifies the task of
running special promotions such as the sweepstakes, and its
tracking and reporting features help our distributors manage
their businesses more effectively every day."

The prepaid phone cards work much like a debit card with a
preset spending limit. The phone system tracks the prepaid
minutes and informs the cardholder how many long-distance
minutes remain. Once all of the available minutes have been
used, consumers can "recharge" the prepaid phone card using a
credit card.

openMEDIA Prepaid, designed as a reseller platform, is built
on a fully integrated Oracle 7 database, PowerBuilder front-
end applications, IBM RS/6000 or Stratus Continuum processors,
a Summa Four or Excel Switch, Dialogic-based voice response
units and a voice recognition option.

Open Development Corporation develops and markets software
solutions to telecommunications companies worldwide. The
company is recognized as an industry leader in highly
available, large network-based enhanced service platforms and
prepaid phone card systems. Founded in 1992, Open Development
is committed to providing its customers with high performance,
full-featured telecommunications services for wireline and
wireless networks worldwide. Open Development's products are
implemented as strategic business solutions because they
enable service providers to expand their offerings, grow their
customer base, and increase revenue.

GTE Card Services Incorporated, based in Irving, Tex., is a
wholly owned subsidiary of GTE Information Services
Incorporated.  GTE Corporation, the parent company of GTE
Information Services Incorporated, is the world's
fourth-largest publicly owned telecommunications company.

GERMAN MINISTRIES EDGE TOWARDS AGREEMENT ON TELECOMS REGULATOR

The German economics ministry is looking increasingly likely to take
full responsibility for the new German telecommunications regulator,
after a lengthy and acrimonious battle within the country's ruling
three-party coalition.

Although a political agreement has not yet been reached, a final
decision is anticipated before next Wednesday (January 24) when the
ministry of post and telecommunications is hoping to submit to the
cabinet the draft version of its new telecommunications bill which will
pave the way for liberalisation in 1998.  The bill was supposed to be
submitted in December but has been delayed by the dispute over
regulation (Telecom Markets, 283/1).

Political negotiations are continuing in an attempt to settle the issue
by the deadline of January 24, to which the government is determined to
adhere.  Assuming that agreement can be reached on the fundamental
issue of which ministry to which the new regulator should report, the
details of the agreement can be worked out later during the legislative
process.

The first parliamentary reading of the bill is due to take place on
February 1 and the relevant parliamentary committee will begin
discussing it on February 7.  The bill is expected to be approved in
June.

The dispute has involved a cabinet battle between post and
telecommunications minister Wolfgang Botsch (who is a member of the
Christian Social Union, CSU), economics minister Gunter Rexrodt (a
member of the Free Democrat Party, FDP) and minister of technology and
education Jurgen Ruttgers (a member of the Christian Democrat Party,
CDU).

It appears that agreement has already been reached to split
responsibility for telecommunications regulation, with the economic
ministry's Federal Cartel Office taking charge of competition issues,
and another higher governmental authority taking over everything else.

It now seems likely that the economics ministry will gain control of
the new authority as well -- despite the opposition of the CSU and the
CDU.

This outcome reflects the fact that Rexrodt is continuing to wield
considerable political influence, despite the weakening position of the
FDP within the coalition.

BT, AT&T AND C&W GET SET TO FIGHT FOR THE HAND OF FININVEST

BT and AT&T have emerged as rivals to Cable & Wireless Europe in a race
to set up a strategic alliance with Fininvest, the Italian conglomerate
owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Each of the suitors is anxious to do a deal with Fininvest in order to
gain access to the national terrestrial broadcast network run by its
audiovisual subsidiary Mediaset.  This network could be used as a
springboard for opportunities in both fixed and wireless
communications.

BT is pursuing an alliance with Fininvest through Albacom, its joint
venture with leading Italian bank Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (Telecom
Markets, 267/3).  Albacom aims to secure a partnership by taking a
small equity stake in Mediaset.

It is thought that AT&T is also interested in a stake in Mediaset.

On the other hand Cable & Wireless Europe, which is equally owned by
C&W of the UK and Veba of Germany, appears to be seeking an alliance
that might not involve any equity acquisition at all.

This could put C&WE at a disadvantage, since it is thought that
Fininvest will favour potential partners that are prepared to take a
stake in Mediaset.  However, there are indications that it might bid
for a stake in Mediaset if it has to.

Fininvest says that the exact size of the Mediaset stake to be sold
will depend on the partner, although it is unlikely to be large.
Sources suggest that it will be in the region of about five per cent.
Fininvest expects to announce its telecommunications partner in the
next couple of months, and says that a separate joint venture will
probably be established for telecommunications.

Fininvest's immediate interest is value added and cellular services.
It intends to join with its new partner in applying for one of the
personal communications network (PCN) licences that the government is
expected to put out to tender later this year (Mobile Communications,
181/1).  Fininvest says that the identity of the partner will be a key
factor in determining whether or not it decides to pursue opportunities
in basic services.

Fininvest is keen to reduce its stake in Mediaset, which runs Italy's
three main national commercial television channels controlling 43 per
cent of the total audience.  Such a reduction is necessary in order to
reduce the political pressure on Berlusconi, who is hoping to return as
prime minister after the general election which is expected to be
called soon following last week's resignation of the most recent
incumbent Lamberto Dini.  Berlusconi's standing has suffered from the
general perception that there is a serious conflict of interest between
his political role and his control of so many television outlets.

Fininvest has already disposed of 24 per cent of Mediaset, but says
that it will sell another 30 per cent or so in order to take its share
down to about 45 per cent.

In October, Fininvest sold 18.5 per cent of Mediaset for around $1.1
billion to a group of three foreign partners: Saudi Prince al Waleed
ben Talal; Leo Kirch, owner of the German-based Kirch media group; and
Nethold, the European pay-TV group controlled by South African
entrepreneur Johann Rupert.  Then at the end of December Fininvest sold
a further 5.5 per cent of Mediaset for $230 million to a group of six
leading Italian banks.

After selling a stake in Mediaset to a telecommunications partner,
Fininvest plans to divest itself of another 20 per cent to 30 per cent,
partly through sales to banks and institutional investors, and partly
through a public offering.

* Berlusconi, who served an eight-month term as prime minister in 1994,
this week went on

trial facing corruption charges.  Berlusconi, his younger brother Paolo
and four other senior Fininvest executives are accused of bribing tax
officials in order to secure favourable inspections of the books of
companies in the Fininvest group.  Paolo Berlusconi and Salvatore
Sciascia, head of Fininvest's tax department, have admitted making the
payments but claim that they were blackmailed into making them.

Silvio Berlusconi is also being investigated over three other
allegations of corruption as well as for the alleged blackmail of
Antonio Di Pietro, the magistrate largely responsible for this week's
charges.

SEVEN GROUPS IN THE RUNNING FOR STAKE IN TELECOM EIREANN

The Irish government last week finally launched its long-awaited
contest for the sale of a stake of up to 35 per cent in state-owned
telecommunications carrier Telecom Eireann -- a contest which involves
seven consortia composed of nine separate companies.

The government kicked off the process on January 12 with the
publication of an information memorandum laying out the terms of the
bid.  It indicated that it hopes to choose a winner by the end of the
summer.

Michael Lowry, the minister for transport, energy and communications,
said at the launch that the government plans to invest I#220 million of
the sale proceeds in Telecom Eireann and to retain the rest itself.

The government has not said how much it expects the sale to realise
altogether.  Some local observers this week predicted figures ranging
from #400 million to #500 million.  One City banker more conservatively
estimated #350 million, having valued the whole company at #1 billion.

The government has not confirmed that it will sell the full 35 per cent
allocation in this offering (Telecom Markets, 274/21), although this is
widely understood to be its intention.  Once the full stake has been
sold, the government plans to retain a stake of between 60 per cent and
65 per cent, and to offer up to five per cent to company employees.

The seven rival bidders are:

* the grouping of BT and US carrier MCI;
* Telia of Sweden and Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN) of the
Netherlands;
* Bell Atlantic, the US regional Bell operating company;
* AirTouch, the US cellular operator;
* GTE, the US local telephone operator;
* Singapore Telecom; and
* Tele Danmark.

The first three groups are viewed as the front runners.

The BT-led group is seen as the favourite.  The involvement of MCI, in
which BT holds a 20-per-cent stake, might help to offset political
concerns over the possibility of a UK company taking a major stake in
one of Ireland's largest companies.  One observer said a US carrier
might defuse some of the political anxieties.  MCI is also a 25-per-
cent shareholder in Concert, the global corporate services joint
venture with BT.  If BT wins the bid then Telecom Eireann would become
the local distributor of Concert services.

Another strong candidate is the team of Telia and KPN, which are
already partners in the Unisource alliance.  Last month a grouping of
KPN and another Unisource member, Swiss PTT Telecom, was the runner-up
in the contest for a stake in Belgian carrier Belgacom (Telecom
Markets, 283/5).

Two of the other bidders, Singapore Telecom and Tele Danmark, could
decide to join forces, having teamed up successfully to win the
Belgacom stake ahead of the Dutch/Swiss group.

The involvement of AirTouch is surprising since, as a cellular
operator, it is hardly likely to be interested in Telecom Eireann's
fixed business.  The company is thought to have offered to buy Eircell,
Telecom Eireann's mobile division, separately from the rest of the
company.  Such a sale would be opposed by the Communications Workers
Union, which represents the majority of Telecom Eireann workers and has
some influence on the bid.  The CWU has made clear its opposition to
any deals that involve the break-up of the carrier and a consequent
weakening of its power.

Several other potential bidders which at one time had expressed
interest had already pulled out -- including Cable & Wireless (Telecom
Markets, 277/15) and AT&T (Telecom Markets, 259/3).

How to spend the money? Lowry said last week that Telecom Eireann will
use its I#220 million share of the sale proceeds to ``restructure and
strengthen'' itself in order to meet future de-regulation of the Irish
telecommunications market.  The government is to introduce full
competition on January 1, 2000 -- two years later than most European
countries.

The government wants to see a reduction in the carrier's costs and
prices. It is thought that management might offer voluntary redundancy
to about 2,000 of the carrier's 11,000-strong workforce after the sale.
 A significant rebalancing of tariffs is also likely at some point.

In addition, the carrier is also expected to draw on the expertise of
its new partner in order to invest in the introduction of the sorts of
advanced services that are already available in other countries.

In particular, the government would like to:

* improve the standard of telecommunications services offered to
multinational companies that are interested in setting up in Ireland;

* expand the household penetration rate of telephone services;

* encourage an acceleration in the rate of subscriber growth at
Eircell;

* restructure Telecom Eireann's cable television business, Cablelink,
and develop its network in order to offer broadband services and to
make its capacity available to any other interested service providers;

* provide key personnel and technical support for Telecom Eireann.

The government admits that the introduction of a strategic partner will
probably lead to redundancies at Telecom Eireann but argues that the
economic benefits generated by increasing the carrier's efficiency will
help to create new jobs in the economy as a whole.

New regulator: Lowry also announced the proposed creation of an
independent regulator to take over the regulatory functions that are
currently performed by his ministry.  The government wants to set up
the new regulator next year.

FRENCH MINISTER PROPOSES INDEPENDENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATOR

French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon outlined the basics
of the new telecommunications law on January 9 at a round table meeting
marking the end of the consultation process that was initiated on
October 13 (Telecom Markets, 279/1).

Fillon proposed the creation of an independent telecommunications
regulator along the lines of the current television regulator, the
Conseil superieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA).  The new regulator would have
responsibility for applying regulations and imposing sanctions.  The
government would retain responsibility for handing out licences and
would establish the main rules of the game.

The minister originally suggested that his ministry should retain more
of its regulatory powers (Telecom Markets, 279/1) but was swayed by the
strong support for a more independent regulatory authority that was
demonstrated during the consultation process.

The details of the split in responsibility will not become clear until
the draft legislation is presented to parliament, probably in March.
Before that stage is reached, Fillon has to present his proposals to
the prime minister for approval.  The law is due to become law by July
1.

The minister also proposed the creation of a separate agency charged
with administering the distribution of radio frequencies.

In addition, Fillon suggested that France Telecom continue to provide
universal service with new operators contributing to a fund to
subsidise this.  The universal service obligation will initially apply
only to basic telephony but this will be reviewed in five years time in
order to take into account technological progress.

New competitors will be able to obtain licences in 1997.

No details were given of how interconnection issues would be resolved.

The telecommunications minister did not give any details of the
government's plans for France Telecom itself, but did say that he would
like to see more public discussion on France Telecom's legal status.
The highly sensitive political issue of France Telecom privatisation
was one of the causes of December's public sector strikes.  Fillon said
that prime minister Alain Juppe would make a statement on the issue
before the end of January.

France Telecom will from March 15 provide access to the Internet from
anywhere in France for the price of a local call.  As well as Internet
access it will also provide its own services on the Internet through
its France Telecom Multi Media subsidiary.

At the same time, France Telecom is also proposing to cut the cost of
its Minitel on-line service and to increase the speed of the service as
well.

C&W DROPS THE FEDERATION APPROACH AS EXECUTIVE SEARCH GOES ON

Cable & Wireless this week confirmed that it has dropped its much-
criticised ``federation'' approach towards its worldwide businesses --
the issue which prompted the dispute between executive chairman Lord
Young and chief executive James Ross and led to their departures from
the company in November (Telecom Markets, 281/12).

C&W executives said at this week's extraordinary general meeting, held
on January 15, that the company will no longer use the marketing
concept of the federation, which was created in an unsuccessful attempt
to boost its stock market value.

The loss of the federation should help with investors, said one City
analyst, who said that the ``F-word'' had serious negative
connotations, given that it had been associated with a continued
underperformance of the company's share price.  But he added that this
did not entail a significant alteration in strategy, beyond a certain
change of focus.

So the company will continue with the approach which Ross had already
begun to follow in the last few months, concentrating on core
businesses in three areas: the UK and Europe; Asia-Pacific and Hong
Kong; and the USA and the Caribbean.  Tensions arose between Ross and
Young partly because the latter continued to gather a disparate
collection of additional investments alongside these core areas.

C&W is looking at how to rationalise some of these non-core interests.
According to the same analyst: ``Investors might wonder what
investments like C&W's `Baltic Hub' add to the company's value.  They
are pretty small for a company like C&W to be involved with and profits
are a long way down the line.  They are more trouble than they are
worth.''  The company holds stakes in a number of ventures in the
Baltic region including the Latvian telecommunications carrier
Lattelekom and PLD, a long-distance and international carrier in St.
Petersburg.

But the C&W strategy could soon change again, given that the company is
hoping to appoint a new chief executive in the next few months.

Monday's EGM was called in order to approve a change in the company's
articles of association in order to allow it to appoint non-UK citizens
to the positions of chief executive and executive chairman (although
any long-term appointment is likely to involve a non-executive
chairman, in order to avoid a repeat of the Young/Ross dispute).

However, the UK government, which holds a golden share in C&W, is
insisting that only one of the two posts can go to a foreigner, a
change which was agreed by the EGM.  Since the current short-term
chairman Brian Smith is a UK citizen, this leaves the way open for an
overseas appointment as chief executive.

In the short term, the change allows New Zealander Rod Olsen, C&W's
finance director, to be formally appointed as acting chief executive (a
task he was already carrying out -- Telecom Markets, 283/15).  In the
longer term, the company is thought to be looking to recruit a
permanent chief from the US telecommunications or computer industries.

One name that has been raised is that of Richard Callahan, former
president of the international operations of US regional carrier US
West.  Analysts are more sceptical about suggestions that the company
might seek to recall Duncan Lewis, who resigned as chief executive of
C&W subsidiary Mercury Communications in September (Telecom Markets,
276/1).

There has been some surprise at the absence of any internal candidates
-- particularly Olsen, who until last November's double departure had
been tipped as the most likely successor to Ross, but will now be a
member of the appointments committee, and Linus Cheung, the chief
executive of Hongkong Telecom, the most successful business in the C&W
group, who many thought would have a chance of the top job.

C&W says that both men have issued statements saying that they do not
wish to be considered for the job -- a development that many
commentators have found puzzling.

AT&T SIGNS COLT DEAL AND GEARS UP FOR UK ROLL-OUT IN 1996

The deal that AT&T signed this week for interconnection with City of
London Telecommunications (Colt) is the first of a number of
initiatives that the US carrier is planning this year to increase its
presence in the UK market.

The deal, which will enable AT&T to enhance its coverage in London,
will be followed by a publicity event in the capital next Tuesday
(January 23) which is intended to raise the profile of its Software
Defined Network (SDN) product -- the virtual private network service
which was launched last autumn.

AT&T is likely to use the event, which will be attended by chairman
Robert Allen, to lay out its plans for new services to be launched in
the UK during 1996.

In addition to the already offered data and VPN services (Telecom
Markets, 277/8), AT&T will explain the launch dates for its 0800
freephone, UK long-distance and international simple resale (ISR)-based
international telephone services.

But the carrier's UK strategy has so far appeared rather relaxed.  Both
its long-distance and its ISR services were originally due to have
launched in the third quarter of last year (Telecom Markets, 277/8).
In addition, the company chose last month not to bid for the radio
frequencies offered by the Department of Trade and Industry for
wireless local loop services (Telecom Markets, 283/5).  Nor was it
among the bidders for the sale of long-distance carrier British Rail
Telecommunications (Telecom Markets, 280/1).  It has also previously
pulled out of negotiations to buy UK carriers Mercury Communications
and Energis (Telecom Markets, 242/1).

The interconnection between AT&T and Colt's two networks will enable
the former to gain access to Colt's London network.  In return, AT&T
will carry Colt's traffic on its ISR-based service, mainly to the USA.
When its long-distance service is available, AT&T might also carry some
of Colt's UK traffic.

The agreement between the two carriers is non-exclusive.  It is only
AT&T's third interconnection deal, following previous agreements with
BT and Mercury.  Colt has agreements with nine other carriers.

OFTEL MAKES FURTHER DELAY ON STANDARD INTERCONNECTION CHARGES

The Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) is likely to put off until
next month its long-awaited determination on interim standard
interconnection charges for 1995-96, which could offer savings of 35
per cent over existing rates.

Oftel had hoped to issue the determination this month.  But it has had
to hold back because it is still calculating whether certain costs
should be excluded from the charges paid by other carriers for using
BT's network.

The regulator said before Christmas that it would have to gather more
information on the costs incurred on such elements as BT redundancies,
the running of chairman Sir Iain Vallance's office and the company's
advertising campaigns (Telecom Markets, 283/14) which BT said should be
paid for by other carriers via its interconnection charges.

These costs account for 15 per cent of the total cost of
interconnection, in addition to the 20-per-cent reduction predicted by
Don Cruickshank, director general of telecommunications in October
(Telecom Markets, 279/1), when the charges were originally to have been
issued (Telecom Markets, 277/1).

``Oftel has to be very careful on this,'' said one observer, although
the regulator is still thought keen to reduce the charges by a further
15 per cent to give a 35-per-cent reduction in total.

SERVICE PROVIDERS

Oftel's consultation document on the role of service providers is
likely to attract opposition from telecommunications network carriers
when it is published in the next few weeks.

Carriers fear that the document will seek, in line with European Union
proposals, to establish the principle of equal access for service
providers, such as resellers and value-added service suppliers.

Service providers would then be entitled to cost-based interconnection
rates rather than the retail rates that are currently charged for using
a carrier's network.  Such a change in their regulatory status would
make them much more competitive as well as reducing the revenue
received by carriers.  ``It's a contentious issue,'' said one carrier.

Oftel complained in July after publication of its policy document,
Effective Competition: Framework for Action (Telecom Markets, 274/15),
that few service providers had bothered to respond.  But a number,
including the UK Internet access provider Pipex, have since become more
vocal.

The service provider document was originally to have been published in
December (Telecom Markets, 282/1) but the welter of other proposals led
to a postponement.

OFTEL'S FAIR TRADING PROPOSALS

The regulator last month published for consultation its controversial
proposed licence amendment on anti-competitive practice (Telecom
Markets, 283/14).  BT immediately expressed ``disappointment'' that
Oftel was determined to adopt what it called ``sweeping new powers''.

BT has until March, when the consultation period is due to end, to
decide whether to accept the licence amendment.  If it does not, Oftel
will refer the issue to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

MERCURY'S RULES RELAXED

Oftel last month proposed to remove a number of conditions from
Mercury's operating licence in order to put it in a stronger position
to compete against BT and smaller rivals in the UK telecommuni-cations
market.  In particular, Mercury will no longer have to publish tariffs
28 days in advance of when they become effective.  Instead, it will
have to publish the tariffs on the same day as their commercial launch,
although other telecommunications carriers, such as Colt or MFS, do not
have to publish their tariffs at all.

However, Cruickshank said that Mercury should still be defined as a
dominant carrier in the international-calls market where it has a
considerable market share.

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IN RETHINK ON NTT BREAK-UP

Newly-elected Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his three-
party coalition government appear to be coming round to the view that
national carrier Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) should not be
broken up, favouring instead a broader policy of deregulation that does
not focus solely of restructuring NTT.

Other influential organisations within Japan also seem less certain
about whether a radical restructuring of NTT represents the best way
forward.  The Keidanren, the federation of Japanese business interests,
published a report on the future of NTT on January 9, but was unable to
give a definitive answer because opinion was split down the middle.

These developments come shortly before the appearance of the long-
awaited report on NTT by the Telecommunications Council, an advisory
panel of high-level industrialists and civil servants.  The Council was
set up last April and given until the end of next month to draw up
plans for the future structure and management of NTT (Telecom Markets,
268/1).

The report will be sent to the ministry of post and telecommunications
(MPT), a long-standing champion of a break-up which shows no sign of
changing its mind.  The MPT is due to present its proposals on NTT to
the Japanese Parliament at the end of March.

Increasing competition: The arguments in favour of breaking up NTT are
largely focused on competitive issues.  NTT dominates local services
with a 98 per cent market share, according to the Institute for
Japanese-European Technology Studies at the University of Edinburgh.
It is argued that reorganising NTT's local service business into a
number of regional operating companies would encourage new entrants to
the market.  It is thought that it would be easier for new entrants to
compete against regional NTT units than against a single, monolithic
NTT.

It is also argued, by the powerful ministry of international trade and
industry (Miti) among others, that if NTT is allowed to continue to
dominate the market for local services, the development of multimedia
and interactive services could be stifled.

Dr Martin Fransman, director of the Institute for Japanese-European
Technology Studies, believes that there are broader issues at stake and
that break-up NTT will not in itself create more competition.  In a
recent report, NTT and Japan's telecommunications industry at the
crossroads, Fransman argues that one of the most important factors
effecting future competition in Japan will be the ease and cost at
which new entrants will be able to interconnect with NTT's network.

Fransman says that breaking up NTT or any other such measure will make
little difference unless actual access charges are transparent and
based on real costs.  If this is not the case, new entrants will not be
able to calculate the returns they can expect, and so providers of
capital might be reluctant to invest.  In addition, the government
needs to put in place clear and explicit procedures for negotiating
interconnection agreements, as well as a neutral body to settle any
disputes that might arise.

NTT appears to be making concessions, and in October indicated that it
was prepared to give full and equal access to its local network
(Telecom Markets, 278/15).  However, the move received a lukewarm
reception from analysts as NTT gave no indication as to how it would
implement the new regime.  Critics suggested that the real reason for
the announcement was the company's desire to ease the pressure for its
break-up.

Fransman also favours a break-down of the strict demarcation between
international and domestic long-distance services.  NTT is currently
banned from offering international services, which are the preserve of
Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), International Digital Communications (IDC)
and International Telecom Japan (ITJ).  In turn, the three
international operators are banned from offering domestic long-distance
services.  These are reserved for NTT, DDI, Teleway Japan and Japan
Telecom -- although NTT has by far the largest market share with about
60 per cent.

Fransman notes that NTT is one of the few national carriers not allowed
to offer international services.  As a result, Japan is one of the few
countries that does not have a genuine contender in the international
telecommunications market, given that KDD, IDC and ITJ are all
relatively small in international terms.  Fransman argues that NTT is
the only carrier in Japan with the size and resources necessary to
become a significant player.  But he concedes that given the time it
takes to establish such a position NTT might find itself too far behind
established players to make much impact.

Hashimoto was finance minister between 1989 and 1991.  The finance
ministry holds the government's 65-per-cent stake in NTT.  As a result
it is one of the strongest opponents of a break-up, other than NTT
itself.  Opponents of a break-up argue that this step would result in a
loss of existing economies of scale, and a weakening of research and
development efforts which are said to be crucial for the development of
multimedia services (Telecom Markets, 262/4).  In addition, if NTT is
split into a number of regional companies, it will be that much harder
to induce them to work together to build a national optical-fibre
information superhighway.

Sceptics note that profits from NTT feed into the national budget, and
that the finance ministry is probably reluctant to jeopardise a
valuable revenue stream by splitting up the company.

The MPT position: The MPT will, in drawing up its own proposals,
consider not only the recommendations from the Telecommunications
Council, but also the report produced last year by the Administrative
Reform Commission, part of the prime minister's office.  This report
outlines the most radical blueprint for restructuring NTT (Telecom
Markets, 276/6).

The commission recommends that NTT's local service business should be
divided into four regional operating companies covering separate areas,
and that these companies should be allowed to offer cable television
services (which NTT is currently unable to do).  The commission also
recommends that NTT's domestic long-distance business is spun-off into
a separate company, which would for the first time be allowed to offer
international services.  The three international carriers would in turn
be allowed to domestic long-distance market.

However, it is unclear whether the MPT will propose such radical
measures.  Some analysts believe a more acceptable compromise could be
adopted whereby NTT is simply split into two companies: one for long-
distance services and another for local services.

PARTNERS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO PHOENIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALLIANCE

US long-distance carrier Sprint said last week that it would complete
its Phoenix alliance with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by the
end of this month, and that it expects to launch services in the first
half of this year.

The deal involves Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom jointly taking a
20-per-cent-stake in Sprint, split equally between them, at a total
cost of between $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion.

The final price will be influenced by the valuation given to Sprint
Cellular, which is to be spun off from the rest of Sprint in the first
half of this year.  The Deutsche Telekom/France Telecom stake will be
in the new non-cellular core of Sprint.

A special meeting of Sprint shareholders will be held on January 29 to
vote on proposals relating to the investment as well as on the spin-off
of the cellular arm.

Under the terms of the investment agreement, Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom will acquire the shares at the price of $48.704 per
share.

The moves follow last month's decisions by the US Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and Department of Justice to grant
their approval to Phoenix (Telecom Markets, 283/16).

The joint venture had already received preliminary approval from the
European Commission last October (Telecom Markets, 279/6).  The EC is
unlikely to grant final approval to Phoenix -- and to Atlas, the
European arm of the joint venture -- until the second quarter of this
year.  But competition commissioner Karel Van Miert has indicated that
the EC would not challenge any move to launch services before final
approval has been given.

WEST EUROPEAN SERVICES MARKET SET TO REACH $212 BILLION IN 2000

The value of the West European market for telecommunications services
will increase from $160 billion in 1995 to $212 billion in 2000
according to a new report, New Opportunities in European Telecommuni-
cations, produced by UK consultancy Ovum.

The report says that the bulk of the $50 billion increase in the
service market -- defined as the revenues generated by both fixed and
mobile networks -- will be generated by growth in the mobile market.  It
predicts that the value of the fixed market will increase by 1.76 per
cent from $141.5 billion in 1995 to $154.4 billion in 2000, but that
the size of the mobile market will rise by 25 per cent from $18.9
billion to $56.8 billion in 2000.

According to the report -- which covers the 15 countries of the European
Union, plus Norway and Switzerland -- the best fixed-network
opportunities will arise in Austria, France and Germany.  These
countries all have large markets, incumbent operators that are
vulnerable to some degree and the likelihood of pro-competitive
regulatory regimes.  The report excludes Italy from this group on the
grounds that its regulatory framework is likely to be rather less
favourable to competition.

The countries with the lowest level of fixed-network opportunity,
partly because of the existing degree of exploitation, are Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden.  The report says that in these countries
the penetration of fixed telephony is already high and cannot increase
much further.  Fixed-network revenues are expected to decline due to
the increasing degree of substitution by mobile-network services.  In
addition, these countries have small markets and efficient incumbent
operators which already charge low prices.

The report also believes that:

* The best opportunities in the long-distance market will be in
Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

* The best opportunities in the local-loop market will be in the UK and
Ireland.  Tariff rebalancing and the availability of other
infrastructures such as cable television networks are key factors in
making the local market more attractive to new entrants.

* The best opportunities for the resale of capacity will be in France,
Germany, Greece, and Ireland.  The best opportunities for resellers are
in countries with low leased-line prices and high trunk prices.

* The best opportunities for mobile operators will be in Belgium and
Switzerland, both of which have underdeveloped mobile markets.

The report argues that the chances for the success of a new
telecommunications venture will be affected by a number of factors
including the regulatory environment, the strength of the incumbent
operator and the size and expected growth rate of each market.  It says
that the regulatory environment will be a key determinant of the ease
of entry for new competitors.

Given that the EU is leaving it up to individual countries to interpret
rules on such issues as interconnection charges, significant regulatory
differences can be expected to arise.  Even if the EU were to choose to
enforce its requirements it would take around three years to complete
the process -- one year to discuss an infringement with a member state
and to notify it of proceedings, and then two years to pursue the
matter through the courts.  The independence of the national regulator
and the extent of its experience will be crucial factors in determining
the opportunities available in a particular market.

DEUTSCHE BAHN SHORTLIST

Deutsche Bahn, the German federal railway operator, last week selected
the shortlist for the 49-per-cent stake it is offering in new
subsidiary DBKom,

narrowing down the number of bids to either three or four.

The remaining bidders are thought to include: Communications Network
International (CNI) and AT&T; Thyssen and BellSouth; Viag; and RWE.

Communications Network International (CNI) is a joint venture between
Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank which also has a cooperation deal with the
Uniworld alliance between AT&T and Unisource (Telecom Markets, 276/2).

German steel-based conglomerate Thyssen and US regional
telecommunications operator BellSouth established a joint venture in
February 1995 with a view to obtaining a full operating licence after
liberalisation (Telecom Markets, 262/15).

Viag is believed to be bidding along with Thyssen and BellSouth for a
stake in DBKom and to be considering possibly extending the
relationship.

However, Viag's name has also been linked with RWE -- there are reports
that RWE may be considering joining the InterKom alliance between
energy utility Viag and BT.  RWE has been looking for new partners
following its withdrawal from the CNI joint venture with Mannesmann and
Deutsche Bank last September and its failure to strike a deal with AT&T
(Telecom Markets, 276/2).

Vebacom, the telecommunications subsidiary of industrial conglomerate
Veba, did not make it to the shortlist.  Vebacom is particularly
disappointed as it already has an access agreement to unused capacity
on the Deutsche Bahn network (Telecom Markets, 283/2), and was bidding
for a stake in Deutsche Bahn in the hope of deepening this
relationship.

However, Vebacom this week (January 16) signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with Mannesmann Eurokom, the telecommunications
division of Mannesmann, to form a 50:50 joint venture company.  This
company, headquartered in Hanover, is intended to establish a national
telecommuni-cations network to carry public switched telephony from
1998 as well as other telecommunications services, cable television and
broadband services.  This might give Vebacom a second chance at
obtaining a stake in DBKom.

The number of potential telecommunications alliances in Germany seems
to be growing by the day, but many are unlikely to come to fruition,
according to Malcolm Ross of consultants Arthur D Little.  ``Many of
these will be dirty weekends rather than marriages,'' he says.
``Whether many will result in children is doubtful''.

Second phase bids are expected to be submitted for evaluation around
April and a final decision is expected by the end of the second quarter
of this year.

ROW OVER DEUTSCHE TELEKOM RATES

Deutsche Telekom's new rate structure, announced on New Year's Day, has
been criticised by numerous politicians including post and
telecommunications minister Wolfgang Botsch.

The increases in local call rates and decreases in long-distance rates,
which form part of an ongoing process of tariff rebalancing, have been
extremely badly received.

Deutsche Telekom is being urged to introduce a rebate system modelled
on existing `friends and family' systems as soon as possible, in order
to take the edge off the rate increases.  Deutsche Telekom claims that
this will not be possible until the end of the year at the earliest,
because not enough telephone lines are yet digitalised.

The political temperature was also raised by a computer error on New
Year's Day which resulted in residential customers being charged
weekday rates instead of a lower holiday tariff for domestic long-
distance calls.  Deutsche Telekom has run a big advertising campaign
apologising for the billing mistake and has announced that it will
offer households 30 free units as compensation.  Deutsche Telekom also
intends to offer cheaper rates than normal on the last Sunday in
February.

The January 29 meeting of the telecommuni-cations regulatory council is
expected to consider the above issues and possibly exert extra pressure
on Deutsche Telekom.

NYNEX RESTRUCTURE IN BID TO SHAKE `LEAST-EFFICIENT' TAG

The restructuring plan unveiled last week by Nynex CableComms, which
involves the shedding of 11 per cent of the 2,900-strong workforce,
follows months of criticism from City analysts that the company is the
least efficient of the UK's cable operators.

Nynex hopes that the cutting of 310 jobs and a saving of between #7
million and #10 million a year will enable it to reach operating
cashflow breakeven by the end of this year.

But the company's financial problems were underlined this week by the
publication of its operating statistics for 1995, which showed total
revenues for the year of #85 million -- up from the 1994 figure of #41
million, but still #23 million short of some analysts expectations.

The restructuring involves the centralisation of much management, a
move which gained a mixed reception from analysts.

The company said that more than 70 per cent of the job cuts -- which
will be effected through a mixture of sackings, voluntary redundancies
and natural wastage -- resulted from a #25 million investment in
information-technology systems to handle areas such as subscriber
management and tele-sales.

The axe is falling most heavily in the sales and marketing areas,
reflecting a move away from door-to-door sales towards tele-sales, an
approach which Nynex regards as more efficient (it accounted for a
quarter of sales in 1995).

Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who has
just taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his old
role of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, who
drew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officer
Nicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New York
office to undertake a similar role.  There was only one senior
casualty: Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block of
franchises.

Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industry
analysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UK
operators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs through
economies of scale.

The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing and
administration represented 132 per cent of its revenues for the nine
months to end-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 per
cent for TeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.

The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 by
the end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 too
many.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on an
expected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get the
television customers we expected, but the whole industry expected
more.''

In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UK
cable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- the
proportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in the
industry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on the
basis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be the
best, but it is close to it.  At 30 per cent, it contrasts strongly
with TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.

On the other hand, Nynex's operating statistics for 1995 show that
penetration (the number of subscribers expressed as a percentage of
those who could take the service because the cable passes their homes)
is running at 19.8 per cent -- lower than the latest TeleWest figure of
21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8 per cent.  Nynex knows
that it must increase its sales, but suggests that the churn rather
than the penetration figures may turn out to be the biggest contributor
to long-term success.

Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.
Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churn
lower.  Indeed, it has recently increased its spending.  According to
Mearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in terms
of customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we need
to make it more economic.''

Nynex hopes by the end of this year to reduce the cost of sales,
marketing and administration to 50 per cent of its revenue-base -- the
level it expects TeleWest to achieve.

Nynex's restructuring could be seen as part of a wider trend within the
industry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a general panic,
but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television is still not
selling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a small restructuring
in its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.

The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate culture
resulting from the UK company turning itself last June from a wholly-
owned foreign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephone
company into a public company (though major policy decisions still have
to go through the slow process of gaining US approval).

The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuring
represented the opening shots of a new management style.  It said that
it was purely a coincidence that the moves were announced during the
week of Connell's departure.

As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up in
the wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &
Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,
before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turn
of the year.

Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-up
behaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel good
about it.''

Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,
Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a good
thing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to put
management resources as close to the franchises being managed as
possible.''

Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even with
the changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end of
the year.

Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves.  Nynex was, after all,
only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.
However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement
(January 8), closing at 105p.  It fell further this week to reach an
all-time low of 95p on Monday before recovering to 97p on Wednesday
afternoon after the 1995 figures were released.

INTERNET SERVICES TO BE WORTH #12 BILLION BY 2002, SAYS REPORT

There will be more than 200 million worldwide users of the Internet by
the end of 2002, according to a new report from London stockbroker
Durlacher.  These users will be accessing services via more than 150
million subscriptions, and generating annual revenues of more than #12
billion.

There were estimated to be about 33.4 million Internet users worldwide
at the end of 1995, on 15.3 million subscriptions.

The report differentiates between two main methods of connection: 1)
connection via dedicated Internet service providers (ISPs); and 2)
connection via full online bulletin board services (BBS) -- an
environment where the service provider brings together a finite
collection of information and services.

The report predicts that the number of subscribers to BBS services will
grow from about 13 million at the end of 1995 to over 84 million at the
end of 2002.  The annual revenues generated by these subscribes will
increase from about #667 million to more than #8 billion.

The number of subscribers to dedicated ISPs, on the other hand, will
grow from around 1.7 million at the end of 1995 to over 70 million by
the end of 2002.  The annual revenues will increase from around #127
million to over #4 billion.

The report thus predicts that there will be 154 million online
subscriptions by 2002. It anticipates a duplication factor of 25 per
cent, so that approximately 38 million subscribers will have more than
one account.  This means that there will be 116 million separate
subscribers in 2002.

The value of the UK market alone will grow from #35 million in 1995 to
more than #900 million by the turn of the century.

compensation, since engineers had been on site within the time
specified in the paper's maintenance contract.  BT also disagrees with
Loot's claim that the lines went down because engineers cut through an
optical-fibre cable, saying that the break-down was due to faulty

AT&T CUTS

AT&T has announced plans to cut 40,000 jobs over the next three years,
including 30,000 involuntary redundancies, as it reorganises its
business into three core units (Telecom Markets, 277/6).  The services
unit will lose 17,000 jobs (to reduce its total workforce to 110,000)
and the manufacturing unit will lose 23,000.  The demerger will cost $6
billion (#3.8 billion) before tax and AT&T will take a charge of $4
billion net against earnings in the fourth quarter of 1995 to cover the
restructuring.

DECEMBER 1995

'Bombing' is just one problem faced by electronic 
mail users

      The convenience and simplicity of electronic mail 
makes it an increasingly attractive communications 
medium for business, academic and personal 
correspondence, but it also has its inherent dangers.
     Unfortunately, E-mail is also easy to manipulate, 
and the same individuals and companies that are 
relying heavily on it to conduct business could be 
subject to a range of problems, including disruption 
of communications, violations of privacy or 
tampering with networks.
     A case in point occurred on a New Jersey campus 
last month.
     A Monmouth University junior faces federal 
charges after an "E-mail bomb" that crashed the 
school's message system was sent to the school's 
system on Nov. 20.
     The FBI has charged Dominick LaScala, 21, with 
flooding the accounts of two administrators with  
24,000 electronic messages and causing the uni-
versity's E-mail system to go down for about five 
hours, Grey Dimenna, university general counsel, 
confirmed. 
     "It basically overloaded our system," said 
Dimenna, adding that computer messages were only 
delayed, not lost.
      Investigators say the "bombing" may have been 
a simple act of retribution. Lascala's computer 
privileges were revoked by the two administrators on 
Nov. 17 after they received complaints that he was 
sending multiple commercial messages to 
inappropriate areas on the Internet, Dimenna said. He 
added that some of the messages sought investors in 
a restaurant, while others advertised a "900" pay-per-
call service.
     Joe LaGaipa, director of the university's computer 
services, who was one of the targeted administrators, 
said Monmouth computer specialists traced what 
they believe was an E-mail bomb revenge to a site in 
Atlanta and a remote site in Redbank, N.J., which is 
near the university. The computer account from 
which the random-text messages originated was a 
shared account with another student who was 
unaware of the bomb.
     "[The trace] was basically systems operators 
comparing systems and notes," LaGaipa told 
Telecom & Network Security Review.
     The FBI didn't actually take part in the initial 
investigation. Rather, Dimenna said, FBI officials 
became interested in the case after the trace when 
LaGaipa called the agency to ask if any crimes had 
been committed based on what had been discovered.
     An FBI official verified that LaScala did not enter 
a plea at his first court hearing and was released on 
$10,000 bail. 
     His charges include a felony for using a computer 
used in interstate commerce to send data that would 
deliberately crash a system, and a misdemeanor for 
using a computer with reckless disregard. If 
convicted, LaScala could be sent to prison for a 
maximum of six years and receive a maximum 
$350,000 fine.
     Dimenna said LaScala will also be disciplined 
under the school's conduct rules, which could result 
in suspension or dismissal. LaScala will first have 
the opportunity for a hearing at the university.
     LaGaipa said the university can't really protect 
itself from another E-mail bomb crashing its system, 
even with what it learned from the November attack.
     "There's no real protection ... it can happen again 
anywhere," he said. He added that the only protection 
is the knowledge by potential bombers that their E-
mail bombs usually leave plenty of footprints that 
can lead back to them.

**Ease of use means tough problems

     The New Jersey case may have turned out to be 
rather benign; no more than an inconvenience for 
users of the Monmouth University E-mail system. 
But this and other incidents should send up a 
warning flag to those who rely on E-mail for 
important and confidential communications.
     And there are a lot in that category. The Electronic 
Messaging Assn. estimates that there will be 70 
million corporate E-mail users in the United States. 
The same group estimates the electronic messaging 
business will grow from $3.5 billion in the United 
States in 1994 to $62 billion in 2000.
     E-mail is easy and inexpensive to use. And it can 
improve worker productivity by cutting down on the 
trips to a colleague's desk to conduct a brief exchange 
or eliminating the need to print out and photocopy 
multiple copies of memos. 
     But this medium creates new risks, too. Because 
information is so easily disseminated to a large 
audience, the risk of misdirecting confidential 
information is increased. And once you've sent an E-
mail message to the wrong party, there's no chance 
of retrieving it.
     This is exacerbated by the fact that people tend to 
assume files on a computer are private and are more 
likely to communicate a sensitive issue through E-
mail than they would be over the telephone or in a 
memo or letter. 
     It is also not possible to verify the source or 
recipient of an E-mail message -- unless of course it 
is encrypted or some other security feature is added 
to it. It is extremely easy for hackers to gain access to 
networks, or for colleagues to learn each other's 
passwords and send or receive information under 
different names, or alter messages sent by others. 

**E-mail lingers

     In addition, the law is unsettled concerning 
whether an employer can be held liable for illegal 
activities by an employee using a company-owned 
network. The major telecommunications bill that 
could be passed by Congress by the end of the year 
may resolve the issue. In some jurisdictions it is 
possible now that an employer would be held 
responsible if a worker downloaded pornography or 
other illegal material. Civil suits would be another 
possibility.
     On a related point, E-mail can be used as 
evidence in a court of law, just as other documents 
can. Many people don't realize that, but even of those 
who do, few recognize that even if a file is deleted 
from your E-mail, it is likely still lingering on a 
computer backup tape somewhere else. There is even 
a cottage industry of sorts popping up of specialists 
in locating electronic mail to be used as evidence. 
Two of them, both located in the Seattle, Wash., area 
are Computer Forensics Inc. and Electronic 
Evidence Discovery Inc.
     Another E-mail related issue that is generating a 
lot of attention is the expectation of privacy of the 
correspondents. According to Michael Corby of M 
Corby & Associates Inc., in most cases, "If the 
electronic mail ... system is used at a company, the 
employer owns it and is allowed to review its 
contents. Messages sent within the company as well 
as those that are sent from your terminal to another 
company or from another company to you can be 
subject to monitoring by your employer."
     The 1986 Electronics Communications Privacy 
Act protects the privacy of messages sent over public 
telephone lines and online systems such as 
CompuServe or American Online but does not cover 
private, employer-owned E-mail systems.
     But many people feel that absent a company 
statement to the contrary, the communications they 
make through their E-mail systems are private. And 
there are cases pending, particularly in California that 
could help clarify the law on this point.

**E-mail security checklist

     There are a number of key steps employers must 
take to secure electronic mail and protect the 
company or organization. These recommendations 
elaborate on information contained in "Manager's 
Guide to E-Mail Security," by San Francisco-based 
Computer Security Institute.
     * Write a strong, enforceable policy, like the 
proposed policy provided elsewhere in this issue. 
The policy should outline the appropriate uses of E-
mail, the penalties for misusing the system, the 
organization's intention to enforce the policy, 
procedures for purging E-mail files and the legal 
consequences of destroying E-mail evidence.
     * Reserve the right to monitor. Employers 
generally are protected against privacy lawsuits if 
employees are clearly informed that the information 
conveyed in company-owned E-mail systems is not 
private.
     * Implement security controls. Make sure audit 
trails, password controls and other security options 
in your E-mail software are activated.
     * Investigate using encryption. Pretty Good 
Privacy is one popular encryption method that was 
discussed in detail in the August 1995 issue of 
Telecom & Network Security Review.
     * Ensure the post office server is physically 
secure. The E-mail post office server should have the 
same level of security other network servers have. 
The servers should be kept where unauthorized 
personnel cannot get to them.
     * Promote security awareness by employees. 
This can be done through seminars or training 
courses, as well as through statements in the 
company employee manual.
     * Set up procedures for destruction and retention 
of archives. E-mail messages can be permanently 
destroyed, but generally are not. That's why every 
company should see that its policy for maintaining, 
storing and disposing of key documentation crosses 
over into the electronic mail arena.

**E-mail users fight police intrusion

     Privacy with regard to E-mail is unsettled law 
and, consequently, is the subject of litigation 
throughout the country. One related issue that is 
being fleshed out in the courts involves illegal or 
allegedly illegal material transmitted through E-mail 
and how law enforcement officials go about 
investigating such cases. 
     Last month Telecom & Network Security Review 
discussed the use of electronic mail, and in this case 
a bulletin board service, to set up a sting operation 
through which participants in an illegal cellular phone 
operation were arrested. Another pending case raises 
issues about privacy rights relating to investigations 
by police of electronic mail or bulletin boards.
     The case concerns a small computer bulletin 
board in Ohio. The Cincinnati Computer Connection 
has operated since 1982 and has several thousand 
subscribers, who pay a set fee for access to the 
board. Subscribers have the ability to send and 
receive E-mail, participate in on-line discussions, use 
and download software, play computer games and 
receive periodicals. Some subscribers -- about 3% of 
the users, say attorneys for the BBS owner -- also 
use adult-oriented information and "service options." 
     As part of an investigation to determine whether 
the adult-oriented material was pornographic, the 
Hamilton County (Ohio) Regional Computer Crimes 
Task Force obtained search warrants and seized 
computer equipment including computer hardware, 
video display units, printers, software, data drives 
and internal or external information storage units 
from the BBS operator, Bob Emerson.
     Now Emerson has filed a federal suit against the 
task force, and a separate federal suit has been filed 
by a group of the BBS users. The user group claims 
that only the 45 allegedly obscene images should 
have been seized. 
     The group's attorney, Peter Kennedy of Austin, 
Texas, said the police knew what they were looking 
for and should have seized only those files. The 
group wants the return of their electronic files and is 
alleging various monetary damage claims relating to 
loss of business or other correspondence because the 
files were confiscated. Kennedy successfully 
represented E-mail users in another case of seizure 
of communications for evidence purposes, but in that 
instance the defendant was the Secret Service (Steve 
Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret 
Service).
     Emerson, in his separate suit before the same 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, 
Western Div., is seeking damages of $250,000 for 
the loss of subscriber revenue and the loss of 
computer equipment confiscated in the search. He 
also says in the complaint that the law enforcement 
officials violated his 1st and 4th Amendment rights. 
     The complaint says the officials conducted an 
over-broad search "purposefully, in bad faith, in 
conscious and reckless disregard of [Emerson's] 
federal and constitutional rights to privacy, to free 
speech, and to be free from unreasonable searches 
and seizures, and with the intention to intimidate 
[Emerson] from his continued exercise of free 
expression and to impose prior restraint on the 
transmission of presumptively protected forms of 
expression ... by permanently removing from 
circulation non-obscene adult oriented and other 
forms of expression."
     Emerson's attorney, Laura Abrams, of the firm of 
Sirkin, Pinales, Mezibov & Schwartz, expects 
months of discovery before the case goes to trial. 
The user group and Emerson cases have been 
consolidated for purposes of discovery.

FCC confronts new ruse to get around pay-per-call 
rules

     Pay-per-call operations are using a new scam to 
play fast and loose with federal regulations 
governing audiotex services, but the Federal 
Communications Commission thinks the practice 
violates the letter and spirit of the law.
     Pay-per-call or audiotex operators have been 
moving overseas at an increasing rate, just as pay-
per-call traffic, usually of the X-rated variety, has 
been increasing. Favorable deals with less developed 
nations and evasion of U.S. pornography laws are 
the lures.
     Robert Spangler, deputy chief of the FCC's 
common carrier branch, said along with the 
movement overseas has been the frequent 
advertising of pay-per-call services using a dial-
around code (10XXX) of a long distance carrier. 
This suggests that the carriers are paying the 
information providers to advertise their dial-around 
numbers.
     More recently, foreign pay-per-call services are 
being routed through "500" follow-me numbers or 
"700" conference-calling numbers.
     Under the 1992 Telephone Disclosure and 
Dispute Resolution Act, all pay-per-call services 
must be provided on the "900" service access code. 
Any carrier involved in either transmitting or billing 
subscribers for pay-per-call services is subject to 
several statutory requirements meant to ensure that 
consumers can prevent access to or charges for 
unwanted information services. Specifically, the 
TDDRA:
     * Requires carriers to offer telephone subscribers 
the option of blocking access to pay-per-call services.
     * Prohibits the disconnection of basic 
telecommunications services for failure to pay pay-
per-call charges. 
     The statute also specifically exempts from pay-
per-call status "any service the charge for which is 
tariffed," and services offered pursuant to a 
"presubscription or comparable arrangement."
     Ronald Marlowe, an attorney with the Miami law 
firm of Cohen, Berke, Bernstein, Brodie, Kondell & 
Laszio, recently sought an FCC advisory opinion 
concerning the legality of interexchange carriers 
providing telecommunications services to foreign 
audiotex operations. The services would be 
transmitted using the 10XXX + international 
number, 1-500-NXX-XXXX or 1-700-NXX-
XXXX dialing sequences. Calls would be billed to 
telephone subscribers at the tariffed rate as standard 
toll charges. 
     But Marlowe went further. He asked if the 
legality of the arrangement would be affected if:
     1) the carrier remits a portion of the transport 
charge to the party advertising the destination 
number; or
     2) the carrier remits a portion of the transport 
charge to the destination entity for providing the 
information.
     Finally, Marlowe asked whether the 
circumstances described would be legal if the other 
IXCs were blocked from providing access to the 
information provider.
     The FCC responded in a four-page advisory letter 
by John Muleta, chief of the enforcement division. 
But Spangler summed it up by saying the FCC 
thinks that "there is such a close tie between the 
carrier and information provider ...  that in this 
situation it appears the carriers were not acting as 
common carriers but were using an enhanced 
service."
     Spangler added that the "payment of 
commissions appeared to be an attempt to evade the 
definition of pay-per-call service under our rules." 
But it would not be successful, and the information 
services would be required to be accessed through a 
"900" number. One criteria for evaluating whether a 
service is a pay-per-call service is whether the 
consumer pays the provider more than what is 
required to transmit the call. The fact that the IXCs 
would be paying a commission to the information 
provider for the calls would suggest the consumer 
was paying more, said Spangler.

**No common carrier with blocking

     In the letter, Muleta said that by making payments 
to an information provider or destination entity, the 
carrier would "abandon objectivity and acquire a 
direct interest in promoting the delivery of calls to a 
particular number for the provision of a particular 
communication." This would be true, said Muleta, 
regardless of the dialing sequence used to place the 
call. Further, Muleta said any carrier "that is 
involved, either directly or indirectly, in blocking 
access to the called number by other carriers or in 
determining or influencing the content of the 
communications delivered through its network is 
not, we believe, offering a common carrier service."
     The letter also stated that the fact that the 
consumer does not directly pay the information 
provider does not exclude the service from the 
definition of pay-per-call if the payment is simply 
paid to the information provider by the carrier and 
then recovered from the consumer through the 
transport charge. The situation is not comparable to 
payments to pay telephone or other aggregators, said 
Muleta. "Those commissions simply compensate 
aggregators for their costs of making services and 
facilities available to the transient public for its 
communications needs."
     The transport charge discussed in the Marlowe 
letter is "a sham; the consumer has, in fact, paid the 
carrier for transport, and the provider, albeit 
indirectly, for the information," Muleta wrote.

**WKP seeks rehearing

     At least one company interested in providing the 
kind of service described in Marlowe's letter -- WKP 
Communications Inc. -- didn't like Muleta's response 
and has filed with the commission a request for 
review. That request must be approved or denied by 
the five FCC commissioners.
     Meanwhile, the commission has yet to issue a 
final rule concerning "800"/"900" fraud. 
     Back in August 1994 the commission proposed 
to curb the "800"/"900" problem by requiring that a 
written agreement be executed before pay-for-call 
services can be provided through "800" numbers. 
     Spangler said the commission is not likely to rule 
on reconsideration of the Marlowe letter as part of 
the "800" rulemaking. He also predicted that the 
"800" docket would be concluded first.

**International centers come on board

     Meanwhile, the FCC is making some progress in 
dealing with the international audiotex problem, 
particularly when it concerns adult services. 
     International audiotex operations have become a 
source of revenue in some undeveloped countries. 
When a call goes overseas the U.S. carrier pays a 
portion of that call to the foreign carrier. 
     And since the telecommunications industry in 
some of these poorer nations is government-owned, 
a dozen or so nations have been willing to pay a fee 
to overseas providers to get them to relocate (see 
box).
     To address this problem the FCC in April held a 
roundtable discussion with industry. And, in the 
summer four major IXCs agreed to a "verbal 
arrangement"  to forgive bills for foreign pay-for-
service calls where the calls are disputed by 
customers in the first billing cycle, said John Copes 
of the FCC's international division. The carriers that 
have verbally agreed to this are: GTE, MCI, Sprint 
and AT&T.
     Copes said the commission also is trying to get 
nations involved in incoming pay-per-call services to 
agree not to require U.S. carriers to collect for calls 
that are unauthorized or are made by minors. Two of 
the most active countries -- the Dominican Republic 
and Guyana -- have agreed to comply. Copes said 
that discussions are continuing with other nations.

Sample E-Mail Security Policy Statement

     The best way for a company to protect itself from 
abuse of its E-mail system by employees is to set 
out clear, detailed standards and make sure all 
workers who use the system are informed of those 
standards. The sample plan below is an excellent 
model for organizations to follow in setting out 
standards for employees. It was prepared by Michael 
Corby, of M Corby & Associates Inc., 255 Park 
Ave, 9th Floor, Worcester, Mass., 01609-1946.

Date: Today
Memorandum to: All Company Electronic Mail Users
Re: Company Electronic Mail Usage Policy
     One of the more important advances in office 
technology in the last decade has been Electronic 
Mail. The company's E-mail system has given us the 
ability to communicate with one another more easily 
and effectively. With this technology come some 
practices and policies concerning the use of E-mail 
that all company employees need to understand and 
follow:

**Appropriate Usage:

     It is expected that all company associates will use 
E-mail primarily for business reasons and will 
conduct themselves in a fashion that is consistent 
with the company's philosophy of treating others 
with respect and dignity. E-mail communication, 
both within the company or with other companies' 
E-mail systems should follow the same standards 
that are expected in written business 
communications.
* Messages that are defamatory, abusive, profane, 
sexually oriented, threatening, or racially offensive 
are prohibited.
* Messages that serve as advertising or solicitation 
are prohibited.
* Chain letters (a mailing with a request to recipients 
to continue distribution to others) are prohibited.
* The collection and/or transmission of material in 
violation of any federal, state or local law is 
prohibited.
     The inappropriate use of E-mail is a violation of 
company policy and may be subject to disciplinary 
action, up to and including termination of 
employment.

**Ownership:

     All information stored, transmitted, received, or 
contained in the company's E-mail system is the 
property of the company. It is not company policy to 
intentionally inspect E-mail usage. However, there 
may be business or legal situations that necessitate 
company review of E-mail messages and 
documents.

**Privacy:

     Employees should not attempt to gain access to 
another employee's E-mail messages without that 
person's express permission. However, company 
management reserves the right to access all E-mail 
files.

**Confidentiality:

     If there is a need for sensitive or confidential 
material to be sent via the E-mail system, care 
should be taken to route it only to those with a 
legitimate need to know. Any E-mail users has the 
capability to forward any message they receive, or to 
print and circulate a paper copy. In formulating and 
addressing sensitive E-mail messages, you should 
exercise the same discretion you would with any 
written document.
If you have any questions concerning this policy, 
please consult your manager, or contact Corporate 
Information Services, or the Law Department.

Data security problems touch more businesses, lead 
to greater awareness by top management

     More than half of the 1,300 information 
specialists responding to a new Ernst & 
Young/Information Week survey reported security-
related financial losses over the past 12 months.
     The average security losses were in the $250,000 
range. Twenty of those respondents reported their 
companies suffered losses exceeding $1 million.
     The annual survey found that the increased use of 
the Internet and tools for remote access, combined 
with the problems of hackers, former employees and 
overzealous competitors, are putting network 
security at the center of concerns by network 
managers.
     Inadvertent errors were the largest source of 
financial losses, followed by a lack of system 
availability. Virus attacks were experienced by 67% 
of the respondents, up from 59% in the 1994 survey. 
But just 8% of the viruses caused financial losses. 
And 78% of those who experienced virus attacks 
said the viruses were disruptive, but caused no 
financial loss.
     The Internet appeared to be a particular concern to 
the 1,300 responders from a cross-section of 
business and industry, and for good reason. Of those 
using the Internet for exchanging information 
externally, 20% said they were the target of 
successful or attempted break-ins in the past year.
     Forty percent of the Internet business users who 
responded to the survey said they are dissatisfied 
with Internet security. But a full 87% of them said 
they would use the Internet more frequently to 
conduct business if security were enhanced.
     As the charts on this page suggest, there is an 
increase in how seriously top management takes data 
security when compared with earlier Ernst & 
Young/Information Week surveys. Daniel White, an 
Ernst & Young partner who specializes in 
information security, said companies seem 
increasingly willing to devote more resources to 
finding security solutions. For example, 79% of the 
respondents said they have at least one full-time 
information security person on staff, up from 75% in 
1994.
     But most companies surveyed admit that they 
don't have adequate tools or properly trained 
personnel to defend against information security 
losses, White said. Management awareness and 
budget constraints weren't quite the problem in 1995 
that they were in 1994, according to respondents. 
     But frustration with a lack of tools or security 
solutions increased in 1995 over 1994.
     White advises that "information security should 
be decentralized." He said that there is an increase in 
data exchanges among remote locations -- plants, 
warehouses, home or branch offices --  and the 
people in charge locally need to take on effective 
security systems. 
     "To assist in this effort, common guidelines for 
security must be developed centrally and uniformly 
enforced in all locations," he said.

Former law enforcement official arrested in 
computer, phone fraud case

     The Los Angeles Police Department's reputation 
has been tarnished in a number of high-profile cases 
recently.
     Now a retired member of the LAPD is under fire 
for computer crimes. The retired officer and two 
private detectives were charged with accessing 
confidential information from government, private 
utility and private industry computer data banks and 
then selling the information. 
     Retired LAPD detective Robert Muldrew, 48, and 
private investigators Steven Kudler, 35, and David 
Westland, 28, were charged with unauthorized 
computer access, fraudulent telecommunications 
access and conspiracy. A fourth suspect, Joan 
Jayasinghe, an employee of GTE, was out of town 
when warrants were served but voluntarily 
surrendered to authorities upon her return to Los 
Angeles. She was charged with one count of 
computer fraud.
     Muldrew allegedly accessed Department of 
Motor Vehicles data bases and law enforcement data 
bases through a detective's computer terminal at the 
Devonshire Division police station, although the 
detective has not been implicated. Kudler and 
Westland allegedly broke into telephone company 
data bases and stole billing records. They also 
allegedly stole credit reports and customer account 
records from a local bank. 
     L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Efrem 
Grail, after expressing relief that he was receiving 
inquiries about something other than the O.J. 
Simpson verdict, said the defendants were in court 
on Nov. 6 and that the matter, which has been 
continued several times, could be considered on Dec. 
19, while a pre-plea report is being prepared for the 
defendants by the probation board. The defendants 
and the state are in "serious negotiations" and felony 
pleas are expected based on offers made by the state.

Staff Abuse of the Net/Web: A Growing Problem

     When we published our two volume bookset on 
telephone fraud nearly two years ago, we coined the 
phrase "Telabuse" to describe the generally 
overlooked problem of insider abuse of telecom 
systems. 
     Telabuse remains a significant factor, adding well 
over $8 billion to user bills yearly through wasteful 
and inappropriate telephone use by staff. Examples 
include employees dialing "900" and "976" numbers 
on office phones, personal long distance calls from 
work and friends/family interacting with staff 
through the employer's "800" service.
     The explosive growth of Internet and World 
Wide Web use, now easily accessed from most 
workplaces, is leading to a growing problem of 
employer abuse of the Internet/Web, akin to 
Telabuse. I dub the problem "Netabuse." It has 
rapidly become a subject of extreme concern to 
management and security directors. 
     Some recent examples reported in just the last 
two months:
     * A diversified manufacturing concern in the 
Midwest announced the testing of a highly secret 
new product internally to its managers through E-
mail. One manager then posted the message through 
a technical news group on the World Wide Web, 
accessed by all the company's competitors. The 
damage was immense.
     * A manager of a Georgia utility walked into a 
conference room to find nearly a dozen young male 
staffers having a brown bag lunch while viewing 
pornography through the Internet. 
     * A California software concern conducted an 
unannounced audit of Internet usage for one day and 
found 28 employees had spent an average of 3.25 
hours browsing for primarily personal information 
and entertainment. One young employee, smitten 
with stock speculation on high tech IPOs, had spent 
seven hours of his "workday" on personal 
investment research.
     Activities of this sort are common. The problem 
is growing as ease of access continuously improves 
and exciting  choices grow exponentially.  While 
direct costs are minimal, the loss of productivity and 
time can be staggering. A small -- but growing -- 
number of employees is developing  what's closely 
akin to an "addiction" to browsing the Web to satisfy 
instincts or desires involving sports information, 
pornography, investment opportunities and 
developments in technical fields of purely personal 
interest. 
     Experts in the field advise me that abuse of the 
Net/Web and the resulting impact on productivity 
has now become the number two concern, after 
security threats through the Net from the "outside."
     User management needs to address the problem. 
Clear, explicit policies must be formulated, 
distributed and enforced. Security policies and 
protections, which up to recently have only been 
asymmetrical (guarding against intrusions from the 
"outsiders") now must be modified to become 
symmetrical (guarding against outgoing -- as well as 
incoming -- leaks and breaches).
     Users can effectively manage against Telabuse by 
installing "call management" software systems 
available at low cost, starting at less than $1,000. 
These systems block access to "900," "976" and 
other pay-call services as well as monitor for abuse 
and toll fraud. Well over 80% of firms with 
professional telecom managers have now installed 
such systems, which are highly effective. 

**Free market responds

     In our entrepreneurial society, software firms 
respond quickly with solutions to new problems. 
The twin problems of Net/Web abuse and internal 
security leaks through the Internet from insiders 
(whether inadvertent or purposeful) are a very recent 
phenomena. But commercial solutions are already 
available in the marketplace. And -- just as was the 
case with telecom fraud -- the best systems provide 
symmetrical security and management, protecting 
against both external and internal threats.
     Security experts have particularly high praise for 
one such system, called "Sidewinder," available 
since March. Produced by Secure Computing Corp. 
of Roseville, Minn., Sidewinder protects against 
external threats through the use of a firewall 
approach coupled with the user's choice of any 
combination of authorization codes, passwords, IDs 
and smart cards. This is a rather typical approach.
     What differentiates Sidewinder from most 
software security offerings is that it also provides 
control and flexible management tools to allow the 
user to protect against internal abuse and security 
leaks. Employees with access to the system, for 
example, can have limited Internet privileges (e.g. E-
mail only) or full access (E-mail, news groups, Web 
access). 
     Sites to which the user doesn't want access at all 
(e.g. pornography) are blocked. Usage is 
electronically monitored to ensure that the usage and 
security protocols set by the user's management are 
being followed. 
     The cost of a complete system is $30,000. The 
software alone is less.
     Secure Computing Corp. will soon launch less 
expensive systems for smaller users. Competitors 
are announcing software systems that also adopt the 
symmetrical approach. Prices are sure to drop in the 
months to come. 
     Internet software security systems that are mainly 
asymmetrical (protecting only against unauthorized 
access by outsiders) will soon become history. As 
the explosive use of the Net and Web continues to 
grow, so will abuse, by insiders as well as outsiders.

Pick passwords carefully

     Passwords are a way of life in this fast-paced, 
information-based business environment, but they 
are not without dangers.
     Most business people simply can't avoid them 
unless they avoid PBX features such as direct inward 
system access, and also don't use cellular phones, 
voice mail systems, computers and electronic mail.
     Since passwords are so important to keeping 
communications secure, it's worth going to the 
trouble of picking the right ones and administering 
them properly. 
     A large percentage of hackers will move away 
from your telecom system or network if they have to 
work beyond some of the standard entry codes. 
Making codes as long as possible is an important 
deterrent. But long codes don't guarantee security. In 
fact, the longer the code, the greater the likelihood 
that it will be written down and placed in a spot that 
makes it an advertisement for a break in -- on the 
bulletin board at an employee's desk or on a yellow 
post-it note beside the telephone. 
     Find a happy medium. A six-digit code can be 
cracked in less than a half hour with software that 
costs just a few hundred dollars. But a 20-digit code 
is difficult to memorize, in addition to being 
unpopular. Nine-to-12 digit passwords are 
reasonably secure, but still manageable. Group codes 
-- such as one code for everyone in a particular 
department -- should be avoided as authorization for 
any communication systems. If several individuals 
are using the same code it makes it extremely 
difficult for administrators to audit the system and 
track suspect calls.
     System administrators should also be certain that 
codes are changed frequently, in the computer, the 
voice mail system and throughout the telecom 
system and network. Change codes every 30 to 90 
days. Some systems can be designed to alert the user 
on a periodic basis that passwords should be 
changed.
     An extremely important point is for telecom 
managers to be certain to change any default codes in 
the PBX, and make certain those codes are changed 
regularly. Hackers are very familiar with the default 
codes for maintenance and other ports of major 
telecom equipment.
     Security codes should never involve sequential 
digits. Other codes to be avoided include:
     * Common terms, words or sayings
     * Telephone extension numbers
     * Employee identification numbers
     * Social Security numbers
     * Anniversaries
     * Maiden names
     * First names
     * Spouses' names
     If at all possible, telecom managers should assign 
codes to employees rather than letting them 
determine their own access authorization codes. 
Codes should be randomly generated, frequently 
changed, and deactivated as soon as they are no 
longer needed.

Have you used any of these passwords?

1234     9876     4321     1212
3434     1397
     If you answered "yes" to any of these items you 
have essentially unlocked the door of your system to 
hackers, because these are among the most 
commonly used passwords for PBXs, remote 
access, voice mail and other entry points.

Justice official seeks computer ethic, better interstate, 
international coordination

     The Justice Dept.'s six-member Computer Crime 
Unit has its hands full, and the unit's trial attorney 
thinks the problem "is not going to get better anytime 
soon."
     Prosecutor Martha Stansell-Gamm says the 
department is seeing the age of the criminals going 
up. Phreakers and hackers used to be primarily 
teenagers, but they increasingly are now adults in 
their 20s and 30s. The "size of the harm is also going 
up," she said when recently addressing a group of 
data security experts at a Computer Security Institute 
conference in Washington.
     Stansell-Gamm cited statistics from the 
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh that show 
technological intrusions have increased by 498% and 
the number of affected sites has increased by 702% 
since 1991. But she added that there are not sufficient 
statistics to give a true picture of the problem. "For 
every report of computer crime there are nearly 500 
intrusions that we don't hear about," she said.
     Stansell-Gamm applauded CitiBank for being up-
front concerning the diversion of $10 million in 
illegal fund transfers by alleged computer crook 
Vladimir Levin. But she noted that most companies 
are unwilling to admit they have been hit, either 
because they feel it will make them look foolish or 
will somehow make their systems more vulnerable.
     Stansell-Gamm said that the computer crime 
problem is more a problem of ethics than of 
technology. She devotes time to visiting schools and 
talking with young students because she recognizes a 
new privacy ethic has to be developed for the 
computer age. 
     "Right now we just teach how computers work, 
but we don't teach how they hurt." Just as kids watch 
adult drivers to see how they protect themselves and 
others, we need to teach this self-defense and respect 
for other on the information highway, she said.
     Ascertaining the nature and scope of the computer 
crime problem is just one small piece of what the 
Computer Crime Unit does. It's other responsibilities 
are to:
     * Coordinate multi-district, multi-agency 
investigations. This is an important function since 
attacks on technology generally involve more than 
one jurisdiction. Stansell-Gamm cited the case of 
Kevin Mitnick as a good example of this 
coordination. Mitnick, one of the most notorious 
criminal hackers in the United States, was arrested 
early this year in Raleigh, N.C., after a chase that 
began in California. Mitnick has since been 
transferred to Los Angeles and is being prosecuted 
by the U.S. Attorney's Office there, Stansell-Gamm 
said.
     Remedies to the multi-jurisdictional problem have 
included creation of an infrastructure to make sure all 
law enforcement can work together: the 
Computer/Telecommunications Coordinators.
     * Train agents and prosecutors. The crimes the 
unit deals with involve highly technical 
telecommunications and computer issues, which in 
the past meant a "steep learning curve" for 
prosecutors, Stansell-Gamm said. Through the 
efforts of the Computer Crime Unit, there is now 
one prosecutor in each district trained in the 
technology and tough legal issues in this field, 
Stansell-Gamm said. 
     The Computer Crime Unit conducts training 
courses for prosecutors, agents, system 
administrators and agency lawyers. It also has 
published the "Federal Guidelines for Searching and 
Seizing Computers" to aid law enforcement.
     * Develop an international response. Just as 
computer crimes cross state lines, they similarly are 
not hampered by international or geographical 
barriers. But nations have different views of how 
computer activities should be handled and some 
countries do not recognize computer crime as a 
threat. The Computer Crime Unit is trying to 
streamline the methods for obtaining international 
assistance and evidence. The procedures need to be 
in place ahead of time because computer crimes 
occur instantly and the criminals can cover their 
tracks and move on. Stansell-Gamm sees some 
progress in this area but believes that ultimately the 
United States will need to negotiate treaties with 
other nations to deal with the security threat.

Selling security to upper management takes new 
kind of talk

     Many telecom and network professionals may 
understand beefing up security will make a 
difference to the bottom line of their companies, but 
top officials usually don't.
     And in an age of belt-tightening and downsizing, 
few companies are going to be interested in 
investments in "technical niceties." 
     That means that on top of all the technical and 
management responsibilities they must juggle, 
system administrators also had better hone their 
powers of persuasion if they want the backing to get 
the security resources needed to protect 
telecommunications and computer investments.
     Studies, such as the Ernst & Young survey 
outlined in this issue, show company CEOs are 
beginning to give information security more 
consideration. But resources still don't match the 
security risks. And security professionals still have 
trouble helping senior management understand the 
need for security in their own organizations.
     "Techies" often have a tough time getting the 
dollars they need for security measures because they 
don't know how to sell themselves, says Patricia 
Fisher, president of JANUS Software Inc., and 
because technical people and upper management 
speak different languages.
     In a presentation before Computer Security 
Institute's recent conference in Washington, Fisher 
outlined the steps information specialists should 
follow to get the security resources they think their 
organizations need. 
     When making a presentation to upper 
management, the telecom or network administrator 
should:
     * Understand your audience. Do your homework 
and find out as much as you can about the goals and 
concerns of the person you are trying to persuade. 
Also, if you are dealing with upper management, it 
will likely be a challenge to hold the attention of a 
CEO who has hundreds of other concerns. Practice 
presentation skills to keep your audience awake and 
engaged.
     * Outline the topic and what the presentation will 
attempt to accomplish.
     * Provide statistics that show why a policy or 
monetary decision is in the best interest of the 
business. Statistics about the scope of the security 
problem can be persuasive. But they are particularly 
so if they are tailored to the circumstances of your 
specific line of business. 
     * Alternatively, show how the security 
investments could provide an opportunity for your 
company. For example, investments in a firewall for 
communications over the Internet may enable your 
company to feel secure enough to use the World 
Wide Web to increase visibility, and potentially 
increase business.
     * The meat of the presentation should be devoted 
to showing what needs to be done to solve a 
business problem. Do not get into technical 
discussions with high-level officials.
     * Make the presentation balanced. Show the 
obstacles so management can see that you are "not 
just a technical person who wants a technical toy" but 
someone who has thought through the situation and 
is looking out for the best interest of the company.
     * Suggest some realistic alternatives. That way 
management knows they can trust your judgement.
     And Fisher's final piece of advice to security 
professionals who need to make a sales pitch is: 
"practice, practice, practice."

PLAYING FOLLOW THE LEADER
IN OSS

By:
Gayle Gaddis

Today's operations support systems vendors need a role model. Those vendors
who have taken the largest share of the OSS market in the past--most of
them network equipment vendors like AT&T, Bellcore, Nortel, Siemens,
Ericsson, and Alcatel--have suddenly found themselves in a changed OSS
market, one that values service over technology, one that expects
guarantees, and one that does not need to be told what its needs are. For
these traditional vendors--many of whom still believe that providing the
technology is the same as providing service--a new market strategy must be
found. They could develop this new strategy on their own, but that would be
reinventing the wheel; Andersen Consulting (along with some smaller
independent network management vendors) has already begun to set the
paradigm that OSS vendors will need to follow into the year 2000.
Certainly it would seem that Andersen, which has entered the telecom market
through the side door (i.e., business consulting), would have little to
teach AT&T, which practically founded the U.S. telecom market and has the
largest installed base of operations support systems to date. Yet AT&T,
like some of its fellow manufacturers, still suffers from an
equipment-based mentality that does not encompass service arrangements like
risk-sharing or joint marketing with customers. Andersen, on the other
hand, has pioneered some of these arrangements for OSS. Vendors like AT&T
also suffer (although AT&T less than some other OSS vendors) from an
attachment to the concept of management systems, rather than frameworks.
Alcatel still wants to sell the customer a box, where newer software
companies and integrators like OSI and TCSI want to sell the customer a
foundation upon which applications can be built (and thus are not selling
the customer any applications it does not need). Essentially, the OSS
market is moving in directions dictated by customers, and no longer by
vendors. And now that AT&T et al. can no longer tell customers what they
should need for OSS, they would do well to follow the lead of
customer-driven players like Andersen.

Changing the Rules
It is the OSS customers themselves--the local and global service providers,
whether wireline, wireless, or cable--that have instigated the
transformation of OSS, by beginning to demand the same types of guarantees
on performance and delivery from their vendors that end customers are
demanding from them. Until only a year or two ago, most telecom
carriers--and particularly wireline carriers, many of whom already had
years of engineering expertise upon which to rely--did a substantial amount
of their OSS development or customization in-house, thus reducing the need
for vendors to be concerned with customized approaches to OSS. Recently,
however, most of these carriers doing substantial portions of OSS work
internally have begun seeking outside sources, not only for systems, but
for customized applications. BellSouth, for instance, is now in transition
from having done 90% of OSS work internally to doing only 60% internally
and 40% on a contracted basis. With the drive to improve bottom lines,
carriers are seeking outside solutions in order to reduce the cost of OSS
development on the books. Given this fact, carriers are very sensitive to
cost issues for OSS, and price has become one of the key points on which
carriers are demanding guarantees, especially in light of the hidden costs
that had become a frequent occurrence as OSS contracts became more
complex.
   BT, for instance, found out first-hand that certain vendors would rather
tell the customer what it wants to hear about time and cost than risk
losing business by giving an accurate, if costly, estimate. BT purchased
products with the understanding that they represented a full, end-to-end
OSS solution, only to hear later from the vendor that additional equipment
or software would be required, thus adding both cost and time to the
implementation. Ultimately, the vendor lost business by telling the
customer what it wanted to hear, and increasingly, all OSS vendors with
this mentality will similarly be losing key clients. Stentor faced similar
situations with vendors, specifically with vendors who began to neglect
customer service once they had established a strong, embedded position in
the market (again, traditional manufacturers like AT&T and Bellcore, and
computing vendors like IBM and Digital are the chief culprits). As a
result, Stentor is now in the process of introducing supplier
reviews--which it characterizes as like a report card--to keep vendors on
their toes and let them know when service is beginning to slip. Such
stringent attention to service, cost, and time commitments will become the
norm as the decade wears on. Carriers today have had to become far too
service-conscious and technology-savvy in their own customer contracts to
simply accept what they are given by vendors.

Setting an Example
In order to meet these newly stringent requirements, OSS vendors must
significantly change the ways in which they do business, devising specific
schemes by means of which they can provide customized service and
guarantees to customers without compromising their own economies of scale
or their bottom lines. One such scheme is risk-sharing, which can take
different forms but nearly always results in increased customer
satisfaction. One form might simply involve project time-tables. If the
vendor completes the project (satisfactorily, of course) earlier than the
agreed-upon date, it receives a bonus. Completing the project later than
the agreed-upon date results in a penalty. GTE is beginning to require such
agreements with its OSS vendors, with an eye to the strict timetables under
which it plans to complete its business process re-engineering. Another
version of risk-sharing can result in a bigger payback for both carrier and
vendor alike, but also involves greater risk--that of joint development and
joint marketing of an OSS product or platform. It is in this latter form
that Andersen has taken a lead and provides a strong example for vendors
that are grappling with ways to both increase customer service and stay
lean in the OSS market.
   Co-development and marketing of a product not only allows customers more
control over the OSS development process at a point at which they would
otherwise feel control was being lost (with the cuts in funds for internal
development), it also increases customers' trust in the vendor. Under other
circumstances, the vendor has a perfect opportunity to resell an
application developed for a specific customer many times over. This makes
use of the customer's specs and expertise, but cuts the customer out of the
additional profits. While a great way for vendors to create economies of
scale, it has angered some customers. Because Andersen works so closely
with customers, however, getting to know their business organizations
intimately, it has recognized hot buttons like these, and hence has
capitalized on strategies (like risk-sharing) which avoid them. Andersen
has a steadily growing list of cost- and profit-sharing agreements with
high-profile carriers: Pacific Bell, Bell Atlantic, and BellSouth among
them (Andersen in fact does business with all the U.S. RBOCs; BellSouth was
the last holdout).
   Similarly, smaller, independent vendors of OSS software and services
have something to teach the traditional vendors as well. By necessity these
providers have a strong customer service ethic like that of Andersen, only
on a smaller scale. When one large carrier makes up a full 10%-20% of the
customer base--as is the case with some smaller vendors--clearly everything
possible must be done to keep that customer happy. These small vendors
offer another lesson as well to vendors like Siemens or Alcatel: how to
build economies of scale in an increasingly customized OSS market. The
answer is in the development of management frameworks, rather than the
traditional boxes that these more established vendors are accustomed to
selling.
   OSI, for instance, a vendor which is just beginning to make a name for
itself in OSS, has already begun to capture a significant portion of the
emerging market for wireless OSS. This is not because it built a system
specific to the management of wireless networks, but because it built a
platform on which wireless management applications could be built, as could
applications for legacy integration on wireline networks, or applications
for emerging network technologies, like AIN (OSI's NetExpert platform has
in fact been used for several AIN implementations already). To address the
same variety of applications, Ericsson would require that a customer
implement several different versions of the same system, and some other
vendors might require multiple different systems and still not be able to
address emerging applications such as PCS or AIN. (AT&T's ability to do
this particular OSS juggling act is still in question; the slow progress of
its OneVision platform suggests that this capability may be down the
road.)

At a Standstill?
While Andersen, OSI, and a few other vendors have taken these steps toward
increasing customer involvement and satisfaction, they constitute a
minority in doing so. Exhibit 1 illustrates the position of various OSS
vendors vis vis increased levels of customer service and willingness to
partner with the customer through risk-sharing arrangements (i.e., the
willingness to actually put their money where their mouths are, rather than
simply calling any contract a "partnership"). The cluster of vendors
scoring low on both fronts should question their long-term viability in the
OSS market; there is no doubt that their customers are. And long-term
viability is nearly as important to OSS customers as customer service
itself. These vendors should take their cues from players like Andersen,
which itself will undoubtedly be in the market for a very long time.

CELLULAR DATA ...READY TO TAKE OFF AT LAST?

By:
Mirva Anttila

The wireless data market has not taken off as quickly as many industry
experts predicted. The rapid growth of cellular voice subscribership to
date has not led to a similar expansion of cellular data usage.
   Cellular data users (both circuit- and packet-switched) represent a
small portion of total cellular voice subscribership. Despite anticipated
growth over the next few years, cellular data users will remain a small
subset of the larger cellular voice subscriber population (see Exhibit 2).
Reasons for slower-than-expected development of cellular data are numerous:
the existence of multiple wireless data platforms (making it difficult and
confusing for customers to choose the right one); the unreliability of
circuit-switched data transmission; lack of standards for Cellular Digital
Packet Data (CDPD) software development; non-ubiquitous data network
coverage; clumsy, heavy end-user devices (some with no communications
capability and some with awkward handwriting recognition technologies);
incompatible modems; high-priced service; and a lack of cooperation in the
industry.
   Moreover, cellular data service differs greatly from cellular voice, and
the two services simply cannot be promoted in the same manner. The sales
cycle for wireless data solutions is much longer than the sales cycle for
voice users. Most of today's data users are corporations that must
cost-justify expensive new technology, with the result that the technology
must live up to its promise. At the same time, both users and cellular data
salespeople must be educated about the need for, and utility of, cellular
data solutions.

What Cellular Data Users Need To Know
The following items are the minimum requirements for cellular data users:
  -- Ubiquity of Service: Interconnect to wireline tele-phone networks or
to (other) packet-switched networks; use with a variety of termin-als;
adaptability to current in-house protocols (systems).
  -- Coverage: In-building capabilities.
  -- Portability: Small, light-weight terminals; reasonable battery life.
  -- Features: Voice backup; privacy and security; wide range of data
capabilities and applications.
  -- Price: Low pricing for ser-vices and terminals.
  -- Circuit-switched Data Problems and Solutions
Having been created for voice communications, analog cellular networks are
vulnerable to interference that causes fading and breakup, and that can
result in dropped calls. For voice communications this is irritating, but
for data communications these problems are fatal since the signal may
become so corrupted by interference that some information is lost. The
success rate on each data transfer attempt is estimated to be only about
55-60%, and if the user moves during a data call, normal circuit-switched
data transfer will be disrupted. Digital signals convert the analog wave
form into a numerical code (1 or 0) and are therefore more resistant to
errors. When signal corruption does occur, error-correction logic at the
receiving end can often reconstruct the corrupted signal. The digital
environment also allows the use of processing techniques that improve
signal strength without requiring any increase in power, so signals can be
transmitted over longer distances.
   To improve the success ratio, circuit-switched data transmission
cellular carriers have begun to install modem pools at mobile switching
centers in major metropolitan markets, thereby increasing the reliability
and transmission speed of circuit-switched data service. This development
enables cellular users with dissimilar modems to exchange data at speeds
comparable to landline rates.
   Operators are also introducing new pricing approaches. To date,
operators have been pricing circuit-switched data transmission in
one-minute increments (like cellular voice). However, this tariff structure
is not economical for users sending large numbers of short messages that
are less than one minute in duration. So operators are exploring the
possibility of offering specialized pricing packages for circuit-switched
cellular data. For example, Cellular One in Buffalo (an AT&T
Wireless/Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems joint venture) introduced a
separate pricing plan for cellular data. The "Data Gateway" service is
available for $4.95/month plus airtime fees: $0.15/minute during peak times
and $0.03/minute during off-peak hours. The network uses modem pool
technology developed by Primary Access Corp. that can differentiate between
voice and data calls for the purpose of separate billing.

CDPD Problems and Solutions
It's now widely recognized that technology developers are often prone to
overlook the marketing aspects of new services rollout and behave as if the
mere existence of a new product or technology is all that is required to
ensure market demand. A few years ago, CDPD was widely heralded as the
"next big thing" in wireless. However, as has been the case with other
heavily hyped new telecom technologies, the market has not developed yet.
Thus far, the primary barriers to the spread of CDPD services have been the
lack of ubiquitous network coverage and the lack of standards for wireless
data applications development. Recently, however, cellular carriers have
gotten the message and have begun to implement solutions.

Ubiquitous Network Coverage
CDPD had been commercially deployed in 41 U.S. markets by October 1995.
This translates to approximately 14% penetration in the country's 306
Metropolitan Statistical Areas. As illustrated in Exhibit 3, five of the
top nine U.S. cellular carriers have deployed CDPD. Nevertheless, the
establishment of an effective nationwide CDPD "network" has proceeded
slowly. To date, only two interoperability or "visiting" agreements have
been formed among the carriers. In mid-1995, GTE Mobilnet and Ameritech
Cellular entered into an agreement to provide CDPD service in each other's
markets, initially covering Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Houston, and San
Francisco. In late 1995, GTE Mobilnet and Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile (BANM)
concluded a similar agreement including all of GTE's metropolitan markets
and BANM's Connecticut market. BANM plans to expand its area in 1996,
pending regulatory approval. Under these agreements, each company retains
its own tariff structure but customers receive only one bill from their
home service provider. Before seamless nationwide network coverage can be
achieved, however, the cellular operators must coordinate their CDPD
billing and accounting efforts. Several operators forecast that 1996 will
be a big year for interoperability agreements and that a nationwide CDPD
network could be in place in late 1996 or early 1997.
   Most operators agree that it is vitally important for the carriers to
work together to create seamless nationwide data coverage instead of
fighting against each other. Nevertheless, several of the largest cellular
carriers--AirTouch Communications, BellSouth Cellular, Southwestern Bell
Mobile Systems (SBMS), and U S West--are not "sold" on CDPD. Most cite lack
of market demand as the major reason for not deploying CDPD. Some are also
not convinced that CDPD will ever be the packet data technology choice for
them. AirTouch and U S West, both deploying CDMA in their cellular
networks, are exploring CDMA's data transmission capabilities. Similarly,
BellSouth and SBMS are reviewing packet data options using TDMA, their
chosen digital cellular standard. Moreover, BellSouth has an ownership
stake in RAM Mobile Data, which provides wireless packet data services on a
Mobitex-standard network, and views CDPD as a competing technology.
   Lack of Standards for Wireless Data Applications Development
In the short term, the success of wireless data depends on the software
developers' ability to create applications that satisfy customers' needs.
Circuit-switched data technology allows the modification of wireline
applications fairly easily, but CDPD currently lacks the software standards
that would encourage developers to create programs. A major industry
problem is that most software applications are specifically created for
certain wireless data platforms. Consequently, some customers are afraid
that once they sign up for certain CDPD applications, they will be stuck
with them (and who knows if CDPD is going to be around in five years).
Wireless data applications today can be divided into vertical (industry
specific, database/host connectivity), horizontal (messaging, fax,
information/news services, file transfer, Internet backbone
communications), and networking (desktop, LAN, and database access). Most
of today's CDPD solutions are specialized applications for vertical
markets, but the demand for horizontal applications is growing.
   One solution to the software problem may be the emergence of middleware,
a software engine that allows data applications to run on multiple, diverse
networks. Middleware bridges surface incompatibilities between different
mobile technologies that all have different protocols. Middleware also
fosters cooperation by allowing multiple applications to run concurrently.
   Some middleware solutions are broadly oriented toward creating fully
open-system telecom platforms with a common application programming
interface; others simply enable land-line applications over wireless or
target multi-platform applications for specific activities like electronic
commerce. Middleware is also helpful for networks employing the same
protocol. It can be used to provide sign-in scripts that suit different
types of CDPD modems. Most wireless data carriers support the middleware
concept because it encourages applications development and gets more
customers into the wireless data mode. In the future, middleware functions
are likely to be integrated into network protocols as carriers realize the
importance of allowing customers to access multiple networks.

End-user Device Problems and Solutions
User-friendly hardware is as important as service reliability, ubiquitous
coverage, and reasonably priced service. The cellular data market will
develop hand-in-hand with the growth of the notebook/laptop computer
market. Some of these products have been streamlined and simplified during
the last few years. Instead of using external modems and interfaces, many
notebook computers today employ Personal Computer Memory Card International
Association (PCMCIA) modems. The cellular phone is connected to this
credit-card sized modem via a slim cable and quick-release data cradle that
holds the phone during data transmission. In the future, the cellular radio
chip-set may even be incorporated into the PCMCIA modem card. Another way
to integrate the cellular data device and the radio is to design products
like IBM's PC Radio, which has an RF data unit comprising a cellular radio,
modem, and antenna.
   One of the first attempts to combine computing and communications
functions was the introduction of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) in
spring 1993. The early PDAs, such as Apple's "Newton Message Pad,"
EO/AT&T's "EO-Personal Communicator," Tandy's "Zoomer," and Motorola's
"Envoy," had the form factor of a handheld computer. The products were not
successful due to premature launching. Early end-user device developers and
promoters made many mistakes with the technology, overhyped the industry,
set unrealistic expectations, and targeted the wrong market (the consumer
instead of the business market). Many of these mistakes were typical of the
early stages of high-tech product development.
   Most early PDAs were too awkward to use, too bulky and too heavy to
carry around, and too expensive. They were like sophisticated electronic
organizers with limited communications features, primarily allowing users
to write notes, keep appointment calendars, and maintain telephone/address
lists. In some cases, users could send and receive wireline and wireless
e-mail and faxes with optional modems and cellular phones, but the devices
did not provide wireless connectivity as a standard feature. The problem
with these early PDAs was that they were not designed for communications
and both end-user devices and applications were computing- and
data-centric. Some of the new products (to be introduced in 1996), such as
Compaq Computer's "WinPad," still concentrate on the computer form factor
and emphasize the backward compatibility with corporate desktops.
   One step in the right direction was the introduction of a cellular
phone-type device. In late 1994, BellSouth rolled out "Simon," a product
combining voice and data functionality. However, Simon was still too
awkward to use, relied on inadequate handwriting recognition, lacked a
clear screen display, and had insufficient battery capacity.
   Motorola's newest versions of "Envoy" and "Marco," and PCSI's new
prototype "PAL," can also be included in this category of
communications-centric devices. In late 1995, Air Communications Inc.
introduced an "AirCommunicator" device that combines cellular voice, data
messaging, and fax functionalities. Several operators, including AirTouch
Communications, Ameritech Cellular, Sprint Cellular, and U S West Cellular,
decided to bundle their analog cellular services with this multi-function
communicator. For the cellular data market to take off significantly,
additional voice-centric devices, more appropriate for the largely untapped
mobile executive market, must be available.

Systems Integrators to the Rescue?
To expand usage of cellular data services, carriers can increase network
coverage, introduce additional features, support the development of
user-friendly devices, and intensify their marketing efforts to better
reach the target business user market. However, the carriers cannot do this
alone. Cellular operators will rely increasingly on systems integrators to
provide a complete service solution. Systems integrators will package the
various elements: the cellular data service, the communications device
(cellular phone, cellular/radio modem, pager, etc.), communications
"middleware" (interfaces computing environment to communications
environment), applications software (horizontal, vertical, networking), and
central processing unit (CPU). To ensure the widest possible distribution
for wireless data solutions, systems integrators have certified resellers
who in turn sell the solution to the marketplace. Unlike cellular voice
service (which appears to "sell itself"), cellular data service,
particularly CDPD, requires more coordinated efforts on the part of
hardware and applications developers, distribution agents, and the cellular
operators themselves.

CREATIVE DESTRUCTION IN GLOBAL PUBLIC NETWORKS

By:
Michael Arellano, Vern Mackall, and Courtney Munroe

The title of this article is taken from Josef Schumpeter, a 19th Century
economist who said that entrepreneurs create "new combinations" that can
rapidly create wealth for risk-takers and, in the process, undermine the
position of established competitors. Overall, economic activity increases
and wealth is created, but competitors who cannot adapt fast enough will
see their assets decline markedly in value: hence, "creative destruction"
or "productive chaos."
   These phrases are apt descriptions of today's global public network
market in the sense that established and emerging carriers, in the U.S. and
globally, seek to expand their current service portfolios to provide voice
(both local and long distance), video, high-speed data, home shopping and
banking, and other types of communications services. As operators seek to
enter new markets and protect their positions in their existing markets,
old ways of doing business, as well as the infrastructure used to deliver
services, will undergo radical transformation.
   Given regulatory changes and technological development, stable
monopolies and guaranteed market share are things of the past.

U.S. Local Services Market
In the U.S. market, the long-awaited reform of the telecommunications
industry appears increasingly close to reality. As a result, telecom
operators can become "one-stop shops," offering customers several different
types of services, provided they can raise the capital for the necessary
network upgrades.
   Exhibit 4 illustrates what is at stake in terms of revenue. Although the
pie is getting bigger, competition means that the current size of each type
of operator's slice is not guaranteed. Exhibits 5 and 6 show the same set
of services by carrier group market share in 1995 and 2000, respectively.
Local exchange carriers (LECs) provide local phone service (the first four
rows); interexchange carriers (IXCs) offer long distance service;
Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) also offer local service; and Multiple
System Operators (MSOs) are large cable TV operators.
   These carriers currently operate primarily within their own well-defined
markets, but distinctions between the different carrier groups will become
less meaningful following the implementation of telecom reform. Indeed,
combinations between operators from different groups are inevitable. The
IXCs will compete in the local access market by offering local loop and
wireless bypass solutions. The LECs will lose billions of dollars as IXCs
target business markets with private line alternatives and, eventually,
provide switched access for both wired and wireless communications.
   In the residential market, LECs will continue to lose market share in
the toll call segment to IXCs. Pacific Bell, which already faces
competition in the toll call segment, has experienced revenue declines in
this area as new rivals exert pricing pressure. The same pattern will no
doubt be repeated in the other Local Access Transport Areas (LATAs).

International Service Markets
A similar transformation will take place in international markets. Exhibit
7 presents global telecom service revenues and shows that wired voice and
data services, the "bread and butter" markets of incumbent operators
(PTTs), will represent the major source of revenue over the next five
years. However, many incumbent national operators' markets are being
transformed by liberalization, modernization, and competition. Other
Licensed Operators (OLCs) such as Mercury in the United Kingdom and Optus
in Australia, as well as Global Carriers (GCs) such as Concert (MCI and BT)
and WorldPartners (AT&T and other carriers), are challenging the economics
and cost structure of the traditional monopoly telecom operator.
   Exhibits 8 and 9 illustrate each carrier group's share of the different
telecom service segments in 1995 and 2000, indicating that as
liberalization and competition proceed worldwide global carriers and other
licensed operators will make substantial gains at the expense of the
traditional PTTs. As a result, incumbent operators are preparing their
strategic responses, which include privatization (both to augment financial
resources and to increase managerial flexibility), new business practices,
introduction of new services, and entry into new lines of business. Some
incumbent operators are also positioning themselves as global carriers. For
example, Deutsche Telekom is gearing up for competition in Germany while
working with France Telecom and Sprint as part of the Phoenix global
carrier alliance. Incumbent operators such Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom will rapidly lose wired voice and data market share to the
competition, and will lose it much faster than AT&T did in the United
States. The global competitors have the advantage of greater experience and
agility in scaling national boundaries, while other licensed competitors
will have the advantage of newer, state-of-the-art networks.
   Service operators' responses to loss of market share and management of
potential new opportunities will be key to their success and survival. The
main issue is for carriers to move from high-cost/low-revenue sectors to
high-margin sectors. This will vary depending on market sector and
position. New entrants must target the low-cost, high-revenue customers.
Incumbent operators whose monopolies are being attacked must, at a minimum,
ensure that their service tariffs match their cost structures. Operators in
markets that are already competitive must understand potential entrants'
cost structures and increase their service differentiation and price
competition efforts. For new entrants in all types of markets, the name of
the game is "cream skimming," at least in the early days. The creative
destruction wrought by telecom reform, market liberalization, and
competition will result in short- to medium-term turmoil, with many new
players. In the end, however, we could see a case of "deja vu all over
again," with "supercarriers" providing all types of services to all
customers.

E-MAIL TAP HELPS CLOSE CELLULAR FRAUD RING

Federal authorities, relying on the first-ever court-
approved wiretap of e-mail accounts, arrested and charged three
people with running one of the most sophisticated cellular fraud
rings uncovered so far.

Equipment seized by authorities included a cellular phone
that can eavesdrop on calls placed by other cellular phone users;
a small, easily-concealed device that steals legitimate users'
phone numbers by plucking them off the airwaves; and several
phones that could be programmed with up to 99 stolen numbers via
the phones' keypads, instead of using a separate personal
computer.

The high-tech nature of the gadgets underscores the growing
sophistication of cellular phone crimes. The wireless industry
says it loses about $500 million in revenue each year to thieves,
but independent observers estimate the loss is closer to $1
billion. With the boom in wireless services expected to continue
into the next decade, current crimes are adding urgency to the
industry's effort to crack down on fraud.

The three people arrested were charged with fraud relating
to access devices and conspiracy. One also was charged with money
laundering. -- The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, p. 16, "U.S.,
Using E-Mail Tap, Charges Three With Operating Cellular-Fraud
Ring"

FTC TELEMARKETING RULES TAKE EFFECT

Telemarketers who call consumers back after being told just
once not to call again can now face legal action under federal
rules that went into effect on Dec. 31, 1995. They are aimed at
cracking down on abusive sales practices.

The FTC said the rules were designed to give consumers an
easy-to-use toll to halt unwanted calls.

All consumers have to do to stop a telemarketer from calling
is simply ask the caller not to phone them again. If the firm
does call again, it is breaking the law and consumers should
report it to their state attorney general's office for action,
said the FTC.

The telemarketing sales rules also bar telemarketers from
calling consumers before 8 a.m. and after 9 p.m. When they do
call, telemarketers must tell the consumer that they are trying
to sell something before making the pitch.

Then, before consumers pay, the telemarketer must state the
total cost of the product or service they are offering and any
restrictions on getting or using them.

The rules also ban misrepresentations, tightly restrict the
telemarketing of credit repair services, and make it unlawful for
any company or individual to assist fraudulent telemarketing
behind the scenes. -- The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, p. 6, "FTC
Rules to Curb Telemarketing Abuse Took Effect Sunday"

FLA. IPP PROVIDERS RECEIVE QUARTERLY UPDATES

As of Jan. 1, 1996, IPP providers in Florida began receiving
quarterly notification from LECs of all NXX activity occurring
under the Land-to-Mobile (LTM) option.

The LTM option allows intraLATA direct-dialed long distance
calls to be treated as local for landline customers placing calls
to mobile numbers throughout an entire LATA. Calls that would
normally be billed as toll to the end user are reverse-billed by
the LEC to the mobile service provider on a usage-sensitive
basis. -- Perspectives, December, p. 37

UK RULING TO PROMOTE COMPETITION

Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission demolished a
barrier to increased competition in the U.K. telecom market when
it ruled that customers would be able to retain their phone
numbers when changing operators.

The decision sent a signal to British Telecom that
commission broadly supports the measures that promote
competition.

The MMC ruling settled a dispute between BT and the
regulator setting out a framework for how the costs of number
portability should be split between rival companies.

It said BT should bear 70% of the costs against 30% for the
new operator over the next five years. -- The Financial Times,
Dec. 15, p. 8, "Phone number ruling boosts for telecom
competition"

MCI VIDEOPHONE USES TVS, PHONE LINES

MCI's VideoPhone enables consumers to convert their TVs into
telephones.

The VideoPhone is designed as a set-top box connected to the
television and phone line. Using data compression techniques, the
MCI product transports audio and video signals across the country
via regular phone lines, for the same cost as a regular long
distance call.

Customers can select the screen size, operate the unit by
remote control; select from a variety of on-screen commands; hold
videoconferences with multiple callers; and record conversations
onto VHS tape.

MCI estimates the VideoPhone will be on the market by June
1996 and will retail for approximately $1,300. The company also
intends to offer leasing options. -- Communications Industries
Report, December, p. 12, "MCI Videophone Uses TVs & Standard
Phone Lines"

NEWBRIDGE HELPS TELCOS PROFIT FROM THE NET

Newbridge Networks, a supplier of broadband switches to
public network carriers, unveiled a line of products to enable
service providers to offer Internet access easily and to beef up
their backbone networks to handle the explosion in Internet
traffic.

The approach includes both access and backbone products, as
well as a single network management system designed to let
service providers easily operate their networks from a
centralized, remote location. The new product family builds on
existing Newbridge products, notably asynchronous transfer mode
(ATM) switches, and adds new Internet access products.

Newbridge is aiming its Internet products at telephone
companies, Internet service providers and private corporations,
but will likely start with the phone companies that have already
started buying the Newbridge ATM switch line. -- Interactive
Week, Dec. 18, p. 20, "Newbridge Helps Phone Firms Capitalize on
Net"

PAGERS AREN'T JUST FOR MESSAGES

Data Critical Corp., an Oklahoma City company developing
ways to transmit urgent data over pagers, is developing a method
to let hospitals send electrocardiograms, via pager, to mobile
cardiologists. The cost is $25,000 to set up a system serving
five doctors, and Hewlett-Packard sells the hardware.

The Data Critical system consists of HP personal computers
situated in emergency rooms, loaded with the right software to
compress the data files, encrypt them, then transmit these to a
pager network. The other end of the system is equivalent to a
standard belt-mounted pager equipped with a connector link for an
HP 200 LX, a palm-top computer. The pager receives the data file
wherever the cardiologist is and feeds it into the tiny computer.
The computer decompresses the data and displays the EKG on a
high-resolution screen.

Data Critical is moving on to other applications. FBI agents
are experimenting with the gear. And more developments are made
possible by PCS (personal communications system) paging
frequencies auctioned off by the federal government last year.
PCS uses two-way transmissions, making possible brief responses
and acknowledgments. -- Forbes Magazine, Jan. 1, "Pagers aren't
just for messages to call the office. You can practice medicine
or trade stocks with them"

INTERNET GROWTH HIGH IN '95

If brilliant realizations really did appear as light bulbs
flashing above people's heads, 1995 would have been an especially
bright year for the information and telecom industry. Company
after company came to understand that their futures were at least
partly linked to the Internet.

Microsoft announced that it was redefining itself an
Internet company. AT&T declared that it, too, wanted to be an
Internet company. IBM announced an ambitious Internet strategy.
And America Online set a new course for the Internet.

The awakening of the information and telecom giants means
that even the most nimble of the Internet companies will have to
be careful to avoid being trampled as the rush to cyberspace
intensifies this year.

While companies like Netcom and PSINet, which recognized the
potential of Internet access before most others, have earned the
right to compete with AT&T and MCI, hundreds of smaller Internet
services providers are looking for new partners, new markets or
new jobs. This is in part because of the expected competition
from telephone and cable companies.   -- New York Times, Jan. 2,
p. C14, "Rough-and-Ready Time in the Internet Business"

Pressler Says Telecom Vote May Not Occur Until March;
Nine of 11 Senate Conferees Likely Will Sign Report

          Although a quick resolution of the federal budget impasse
could pave the way for congressional consideration of pending
telecommunications legislation as early as this week, industry
observers are betting that final votes likely will be taken later
this month or in late February.  House and Senate lawmakers could
consider a telecom legislative compromise shortly after they
return to Washington for President Clinton's State of the Union
address, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 23.  If that window of
opportunity is missed, Congress may not consider the measure
until after the Feb. 20 presidential primary in New Hampshire.

          HIGHLIGHTS:  Pressler plans to introduce foreign ownership
measure soon...Conferees clarify facilities-based competition
requirement for Bell company market entry...Conference agreement
will not supersede antitrust consent decrees...Rural advocates
concerned about effect of geographic rate averaging language on
business services...Draft calls for "explicit" universal service
support mechanism.

          Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), Chairman of the telecom
conference committee, acknowledged last Friday that a vote may
not occur until March.  "I hope it doesn't go that long, but I
want all the conferees' concerns to be dealt with," he said
during a televised "roundtable" discussion of the measure.  

          Progress on telecom legislation remains frozen until
congressional leaders reach a deal breaking the budget impasse
and sending furloughed federal government employees back to work. 
Upcoming presidential primary elections also may slow
consideration of the legislation.

          Industry sources last week said Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole (R., Kan.) and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) may be
unhappy with some provisions in the compromise.  Sen. Dole
reportedly wants to see language reinserted into the measure that
would preempt states from maintaining rate-of-return regulation. 
Speaker Gingrich reportedly is troubled by the removal of
language addressing the foreign ownership of common carrier radio
licenses and provisions addressing radio spectrum, Internet
regulation, and media concentration issues.

           Sen. Pressler said last Friday that a majority of Senate
conferees will approve the legislative compromise crafted late
last month (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  A draft of the 280-page
compromise and an accompanying 93-page explanatory statement
began circulating last week.  "We have essentially nine of the 11
Senate conferees," he said.  "We don't have all of those
signatures yet, but we have indications that we will."  He
acknowledged that Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) likely will not
sign the report.

          Sen. McCain has criticized the compromise measure because
provisions amending current restrictions on foreign ownership of
common carrier radio licenses were removed.  Industry sources
said they believe Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is the other
Senate conferee who remains unhappy with the compromise. 
Referring to House conferees, Sen. Pressler said, "I know there
are some problems over there, but we hope to work those out."

          Additional telecom bills may be introduced in the near
future, he predicted, adding that he still hopes to introduce a
bill addressing foreign ownership of common carrier radio
licenses.  "My original bill had that in it but I had to give up
some things I wanted," he said.

          Although he had declared the pending telecom legislation
"dead as Elvis," House telecom subcommittee Vice Chairman Michael
G. Oxley (R., Ohio) said last week that the compromise measure
could "very well come to life with some resuscitation."  House
leaders have been preoccupied with budget negotiations and have
not had much time to focus on telecom legislation, he said. 
Until the budget impasse is resolved, telecom legislation will
remain "in limbo," he said.

          Industry sources last week said a majority of House telecom
conference committee members have committed to sign the
conference report.  But the compromise language apparently still
has not been circulated for their signatures.  House Commerce
Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley (R., Va.) is reluctant to
distribute the report for signatures before telecom subcommittee
Chairman Jack Fields (R., Texas) returns to Washington and
decides whether to support the compromise measure, industry
sources said.  Rep. Fields returned to Texas late last month to
be with his pregnant wife right after the "framework for
agreement" on the final telecom bill was announced.  Shortly
before departing Washington, he criticized the compromise measure
as too regulatory.  It is unclear whether Rep. Fields now
supports the compromise.

          Meanwhile, a draft of the proposed conference report's
"joint explanatory statement" began circulating on Capitol Hill
last week.  Language addressing Bell company entry into the
interLATA (local access and transport area) service market
explains the conferees' intent in imposing a requirement that
Bell companies face facilities-based competition and comply with
the legislation's local exchange competition "checklist."

          The explanatory statement says that "with respect to the
facilities-based competitor requirement, the presence of a
competitor offering the following services specifically does not
suffice to meet the requirement:  (1) exchange access service,
(2) telephone exchange service offered exclusively through the
resale of the [Bell company's] local telephone exchange service,
and (3) cellular service."  To trigger Bell company entry into
the interLATA service market, the legislation requires that a
competitor "offer telephone exchange service either exclusively
over its own facilities or predominantly over its own facilities
in combination with the resale of another carrier's service," the
statement says.

          The "predominantly over its own facilities" language was
included to "ensure a competitor offering service exclusively
through the resale of the [Bell company's] local telephone
service does not qualify, and that an unaffiliated competing
provider is present in the market," it adds.

Conference Agreement Does Not Supersede Consent Decrees

          Conferees believe that the AT&T Corp. and GTE Corp.
antitrust consent decrees and the decree which permitted AT&T to
acquire McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc., are "continuing
injunctions rather than final judgements."  To avoid possible
constitutional problems, the proposed legislation does not
supersede these "continuing injunctions."  Rather, the
legislation provides that activities now subject to the consent
decrees will be subject to the "requirements and obligations"
imposed by the Communications Act of 1934, which the pending
legislation will amend.

          "The conferees intend that the court shall retain
jurisdiction over the three consent decrees for the limited
purpose of dealing with any conduct or activity occurring before
the date of [the pending measure's] enactment," the statement
says.  "Nothing in the language eliminating the prospective
effect of the two consent decrees should be construed as
eliminating the jurisdiction of the court to deal with pre-
enactment conduct or activities under the consent decrees."  The
legislation also should not be "construed as creating or
continuing in any way the GTE consent decree's prohibition on GTE
or its operating companies' entry into the interexchange market."

          The legislation will prohibit Bell companies from entering
the alarm monitoring service business for five years.  Although
Ameritech Corp. will be permitted to continue providing alarm
monitoring services, it will not be allowed to expand that
business until after Nov. 30, 2000. 

          The conference agreement modified language regarding the
provision of pay phone service.  If the FCC makes a "public-
interest" determination, it may choose "not to allow the [Bell
companies] to have the same rights as independent pay phone
providers" in negotiating which interLATA carriers will be
"presubscribed" at the companies' pay phones, according to the
statement.  "In addition, the conferees clarify...that the
location provider has the ultimate decision-making authority in
determining interLATA services in connection with the choice of
pay phone providers."

          The explanatory statement also clarifies the conferees'
intent in adding a provision barring states from exercising
regulatory authority on issues on which the FCC has decided to
"forbear" from exercising its own regulatory authority.  "The
conferees intend this subsection to limit state enforcement of
federal statutes and regulations from which the Commission
determines to forbear," the statement says.  "This subsection is
not intended to limit or preempt state enforcement of state
statutes or regulations." 

          Trade groups seeking to protect the interests of rural
telephone companies are concerned about a change in legislative
language addressing geographic rate averaging for interexchange
service.  The latest draft of the measure requires interexchange
carriers (IXCs) to charge residential subscribers in rural and
high-cost areas the same rates they charge to such customers in
urban areas.  A previous draft of the legislation did not
specifically refer to residential customers, but the industry
groups had understood that it applied to both residential and
business subscribers.

          Rural telecom advocates are worried that the new language
could result in geographic rate deaveraging for business services
because those services are not mentioned specifically in the
bill.  In the draft report, conferees note that they do not
expect the legislation to alter geographic rate averaging
policies now enforced by the FCC.

          Conferees expect that interexchange carriers making
unauthorized changes to a subscriber's primary IXC ("slamming")
will reimburse the original carrier for forgone revenues.  But
they also expect the FCC's rules to "provide that consumers are
made whole" when they are slammed.  "Specifically, the
Commission's rules should require that carriers guilty of
`slamming' should be held liable for premiums, including travel
bonuses, that would otherwise have been earned by telephone
subscribers," the statement says.

          It clarifies that states may require a carrier seeking to
offer services in a rural area to meet the legislation's
requirements for designation as a carrier eligible to receive
universal service support payments.  "That is, the state may
require the competitor to offer service and advertise throughout
the service area served by a rural telephone company," the draft
says.  The provision would not apply if the rural telephone
company has received an exemption, suspension, or modification
that effectively prevents a competitor from meeting the "eligible
carrier" requirements.

Conferees Would Like `Explicit' Universal Service Support

          Conferees intend, "to the extent possible," that any
universal service support mechanisms maintained or created by the
legislation will be "explicit" rather than "implicit," the
statement says.  Conferees do not view the FCC's existing docket
80-286 federal-state joint board proceeding on jurisdictional
separations issues as an "appropriate foundation" for the
universal service proceeding required by the legislation (TR,
July 17, 1995).  Within 15 months of the legislation's enactment,
the FCC must act on a federal-state joint board's recommendations
for defining the services to be subsidized by federal universal
service support mechanisms.

          The legislation requires all carriers of interstate telecom
services to contribute to the "preservation and advancement" of
universal service.  The FCC may exempt a carrier from the
requirement if its contribution would be "de minimis."  Eligible
telecom carriers can receive federal support only to "provide,
maintain, and upgrade facilities and services for universal
service in the area for which the support is received," the
statement says.

          The conference committee included legislative language to
"ensure that the Commission could, if future circumstances
warrant, include commercial mobile service providers which
provide telephone exchange service or exchange access in the
definition of `local exchange carrier,'" the statement continues.

          It also explains the conferees' compromise on controversial
proposals to protect minors from gaining access to "indecent"
material through the Internet.  "Use of the indecency standard
poses no significant risk to the free-wheeling and vibrant nature
of discourse or to serious, literary, and artistic works that
currently can be found on the Internet, and which is expected to
continue and grow," the statement says.  "As the Supreme Court
itself noted when upholding the constitutionality of indecency
prohibitions, prohibiting indecency merely focuses speakers to
recast their message into less offensive terms but does not
prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of communication. 
Likewise, requiring that access restrictions be imposed to
protect minors from exposure to indecent material does not
prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of the indecent
communication.  It merely puts it in its appropriate place:  away
from children."

          The draft statement also outlines the conference committee's
reasoning in streamlining the regulatory obligations imposed on
operators of "open video systems."  The conference panel expects
that common carriers will be encouraged to deploy open video
systems, introducing "vigorous" competition in entertainment and
information markets.  Conferees also recognize that common
carriers deploying such systems will be new entrants in
established markets and "deserve lighter regulatory burdens to
level the playing field," the statement says.  In addition, the
development of competition means "that government oversight and
regulation can and should be reduced."

          Regulation of the "cable programming services" tier of cable
TV offerings will sunset March 31, 1999, the statement says.  It
describes a new "effective competition" test for determining when
deregulation of both the cable programming and basic service
tiers should occur.  The test concludes that effective
competition is in place when a telephone company or any
multichannel video programming distributor is offering comparable
video programming services "directly to subscribers by any means"
in an unaffiliated cable TV operator's franchise area.

`888' CODE DEADLINE

          The LEC National Product Team has pushed back the
implementation date for the new "888" toll-free service access
code from March 1 to March 11, according to a letter sent by
MCI's Vice President-federal regulatory affairs, Donald F. Evans,
to the team's Chairman, Dan Winters of Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co.  The Jan. 5 letter says Mr. Winters "indicated to
MCI that the cause of this delay is largely due" to Bell
Communications Research's "missing the due date for delivery. . .
of the [service control point] software to the first field
verification site."

          Mr. Evans added, "We demand that the March 1, 1996, date be
maintained."  At TR's Friday news deadline an FCC-industry 888
meeting slated for Jan. 10 at 9 a.m. in Bellcore's Washington
offices was scheduled to proceed as planned, despite the partial
government shutdown.

AT&T's Workforce Cuts Could Trigger Industry-Wide
Job Reductions, Streamlining, Analysts Predict

          AT&T Corp.'s recent announcement of massive job cuts likely
will trigger further workforce reductions--and other forms of
financial belt-tightening--throughout the telecommunications
industry, particularly among the seven Bell regional holding
companies and GTE Corp., industry observers told TR.  They also
suggested that other U.S. interexchange carriers, and even some
foreign service providers, may further streamline their
operations in the wake of AT&T's action--the largest single job
reduction in the U.S. telecom industry's history and one of the
largest ever announced by an American corporation.  But analysts
differed over the scope of further job cuts, with some observers
noting that many companies already have trimmed their payrolls in
recent years.

          HIGHLIGHTS:  AT&T to cut 40,000 positions, 13% of
workforce...Company will take $4 billion post-tax charge against
1995 earnings...Analysts warn that job cuts could be double-edged
sword...Wall Street bulls say move will make AT&T more
competitive...CWA's President calls job reductions "demoralizing"
to AT&T workers.

          Recognizing that it will be operating in a dramatically
changed competitive environment in the future, AT&T last week
announced plans to eliminate 40,000 jobs over three years, a
reduction of more than 13% of its total present-day workforce of
about 300,000.  The 40,000 figure was double the amount that many
analysts had expected (TR, Oct. 2, 1995, p. 9).  

          AT&T also revealed plans to close, sell, or consolidate some
facilities and write off some assets.  Last week's announcement
represented the "next step" in AT&T's plan to restructure itself,
explained Rick Miller, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer at AT&T, during a Jan. 2 press briefing.  Four
months ago (TR, Sept. 25, 1995), AT&T stunned many industry
observers by unveiling plans to divide itself into three separate
companies:  a telecom services provider, a systems and technology
company, and a computer manufacturer.

          The job reductions, will enable the spun-off companies to be
more "focused," make decisions faster, develop competitive cost
structures, and become leaders in their respective industries,
Mr. Miller said.  AT&T will retain employees with "the right sets
of skills" to keep the three spun-off operations competitive in
the future.  Meanwhile, he said, savings stemming from the job
reductions "will allow the three companies to be competitive." 
Sources agreed that the three future spin-off companies will be
able to operate with relatively small corporate staffs.  Mr.
Miller emphasized that AT&T now will be well-positioned to build
out its personal communications service operations this year.  He
noted that in its third quarter 1995 earnings report, AT&T had
suggested that restructuring charges could be expected.  

Analysts See `Ripple' Effect Throughout Industry

          William H. Gaik, National Director of Deloitte & Touche
Consulting Group's Telecommunications and Electronic Services
practice, said AT&T's announcement could put pressure on all of
its competitors to eliminate more positions and further
streamline operations.  Noting that major telecom service
providers now compete in a global marketplace, he told TR that
France Telecom and Deutsche Telecom, which have not undertaken
significant restructuring programs yet, may now feel pressured to
do so.

          A Communications Workers of America spokesman predicted,
however, that AT&T's move will not trigger massive telecom
industry layoffs.  During the past three or four years, carriers-
-particularly major local exchange carriers (LECs)--have been
"downsizing" in an effort to prepare for a more competitive
marketplace, he noted.  The CWA spokesman maintained that LECs
already have pared away too many jobs--to the point that they are
undermining their service-quality performance.  Because AT&T is
so much larger than most carriers, any job reductions at other
companies likely would be on a smaller scale, he added.

          The job reductions concern the group but they nevertheless
appear to be "in line" with the restructuring plan announced last
fall, the spokesman said, adding that AT&T has been "management
top-heavy" for too long.  CWA analysts believe the spun-off
companies will begin hiring back management personnel once they
begin operating separately, he said.

          Philip Sirlin, a telecommunications analyst with Schroder
Wertheim & Co., Inc., told TR that the AT&T announcement could
generate more job cuts in the telecom industry because "CEOs
don't want to be perceived as being asleep at the switch."  In
particular, he predicted further workforce reductions among the
Bell companies.  MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. also
may need to "reexamine" the operations of their long distance
service units, Mr. Sirlin added.

          But AT&T's action may be a double-edged sword, some
observers suggested.  Although it likely will make AT&T more
competitive in the short term, the job-cutting move could
backfire if AT&T's service quality slips, they explained.  Mr.
Gaik told TR that the job cutbacks could create a "highly
disgruntled workforce," a result that could "spill over" to
customers in the form of poor service.  That, in turn, could help
AT&T's competitors.  Mr. Gaik added that savings stemming from
the job reductions will enable AT&T to price its services more
aggressively and to invest in new technologies.

Wall Street Views AT&T's Action as Necessary Step

          Wall Street analysts generally praised AT&T's action.  In a
statement, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., said the "cost-
cutting moves should improve margins, increase cash flows, and
further solidify the company's Aa3 senior unsecured rating."  It
added that AT&T is "well-positioned to meet the competition and
potentially can improve its credit rating over the long term." 
But Moody's warned that AT&T "faces many long-term challenges as
deregulation and increased competition...exert pressure on
telecommunications margins."  Although the "ultimate" capital
structure of the spin-off companies has not been established,
Moody's is "confident that AT&T's credit quality will not be
seriously impaired."

          Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. reaffirmed AT&T's senior
debt rating of "AA+" (Double-A-Plus) following the company's Jan.
2 announcement.  It said the action reflects AT&T's progress in
refocusing on communications services.  While its core telecom
services business may face growing competition as LECs enter the
interLATA (local access and transport area) service market,
AT&T's restructuring "will help position it to cope with the
added competition," Duff & Phelps said.  "The reduction in
business risk associated with the divestiture of [certain]
enterprises will strengthen overall credit quality.  Meanwhile,
the proceeds raised will give the company added financial
flexibility and allow it to capitalize its remaining units in a
manner consistent with its current rating level."

          In an investment analysis released prior to last week's
announcement, Merrill Lynch had predicted that AT&T would
announce job cuts early this year.  It had suggested that the
company might target some of its savings "to fund the longer term
investments they need to make."  Those would include "entering
the local telephone business, investing overseas as a new entrant
(e.g., Mexico), adding to its marketing staff and promotions, and
rebuilding billing systems" to reduce its dependence on LEC
billing and collection services.

AT&T Takes `Charge' Against Earnings To Cover Restructuring
Expenses

          AT&T will take a post-tax charge of about $4 billion against
fourth-quarter 1995 earnings to cover the cost of implementing
its plan to restructure into three independent companies.  The
charge will be about $6 billion before taxes and "will reduce
fourth quarter net income by approximately $4 billion or about
$2.50 a share," AT&T said.  Those figures could change by the
time AT&T closes its 1995 fourth quarter books later this month,
it added.

          About 70% of the 40,000 jobs will be eliminated this year;
the remaining positions will be terminated in 1997 and possibly
1998.  Sixty percent of the eliminated jobs will be management
positions.  Eighty-five percent of the job reductions will affect
AT&T's domestic operations, and the remaining 15% will be
allocated among several foreign operations, AT&T officials said.

          About 30,000 of the job cuts will be involuntary. 
Meanwhile, 6,500 AT&T managers already have accepted a voluntary
severance package, and an additional 4,000 employees likely will
remain with business units the company intends to sell.  The
severance package was offered to 72,000 managers before the end
of last year.  AT&T officials said last week that the package may
be extended to an additional 40,000 managers, potentially
reducing the number of lay-offs.  A decision to extend the
voluntary severance package will be made within the next 60 days
or so.

          AT&T did not provide information about the planned job
reductions disaggregated by country, state, or company facility. 
But it did reveal plans to cut 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in New Jersey,
where it is headquartered.  The spun-off AT&T telecom services
company will have 110,000 employees after job reductions of about
17,000, AT&T said.  The systems and technology company would have
108,000 employees after reductions of 23,000.  Of the 40,000 jobs
to be eliminated, 10,000 will be corporate-wide staff positions
in the present-day AT&T information systems, human resources, and
financial operations units.  AT&T does not anticipate significant
job reductions in the future, but small-scale job-cutting actions
would occur, a company spokesman said.  AT&T said the fourth-
quarter charge will cover:

          *  Workforce reductions resulting in severance pay and
related costs totaling about $2.6 billion before taxes;

          *  The "write down" of the value of assets, estimated to
total about $1.7 billion;

          *  The closing, selling, or consolidation of facilities that
would not be "strategic" for the spun-off companies' operations
(total costs could reach $1.1 billion); and

          *  Other unspecified actions totaling $700 million.  This
could involve a variety of miscellaneous costs pertaining to the
restructuring, the spokesman said.

          AT&T officials would not comment on what facilities might be
closed or sold, saying that announcements will be made in "due
course."  AT&T already has unveiled plans to sell its Paradyne
unit, a Key Largo, Fla.-based manufacturer of modems for personal
computers (TR, Oct. 23, 1995).  The actions related to the charge
mainly will affect the new AT&T services company and the new
systems and technology company, which will provide network,
business, and consumer technology and equipment.

          AT&T already had announced last year (TR, Sept. 25, 1995, p.
2) that it will eliminate 8,500 jobs at AT&T Global Information
Solutions, which will become part of the spun-off computer
company.  Those jobs are in addition to the 40,000 jobs
reductions announced last week.  AT&T had taken a $1.5 billion
charge against third quarter 1995 earnings to reflect the cost of
the GIS restructuring.

          The new AT&T services company will reduce its workforce
through the "continued application" of new technologies,
consolidation of operator services, and a reduction of marketing
and sales support positions.  It also plans to reduce the value
of some investments, such as its stake in Canadian carrier Unitel
Communications, Inc. (TR, Oct. 2, 1995).  Plans also call for
altering several of the new AT&T services company's online
services by adopting Internet-based technical platforms and for
modifying some messaging services.  Those plans will require AT&T
to write down "the value of some unneeded network facilities--
such as microwave towers--and refocus some of its undersea cable
operations," AT&T said.

Allen Expresses Regret, CWA's Bahr Expresses Bitterness

          AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Allen
said in an electronic mail message to AT&T employees last week
that the job reductions are driven by changes in the marketplace,
as well as by customers' needs, new technology, and public
policy.  "I understand how wrenching it will be for employees and
their families," Mr. Allen said.  "But the actions we are
announcing today are absolutely essential if our businesses are
to be competitive."  For workers leaving the company, AT&T will
provide a severance package, access to a job database, support
for retraining and education, and workshops on financial planning
and stress management.  Employees may be considered for jobs in
the new companies six months after they leave.

          In a statement, CWA President Morton Bahr used unusually
harsh words to criticize AT&T's action.  "AT&T has started off
the New Year by demoralizing its workforce and delivering a
setback to the joint cooperative program we have been attempting
to build with the company over the past three years," he said.  

          Mr. Bahr added that CWA did not receive "the courtesy of
advance notification of today's mass-cutback announcement, which
in the past has been the usual practice prior to such
announcements."  It may take up to 60 days, he said, for AT&T to
provide details on the jobs and locations that will be affected.

          "This is yet another case of the kind of mindless job
destruction that has terrorized working Americans in recent years
as corporate executives play to Wall Street and manipulate their
stock prices," Mr. Bahr said.  

          AT&T "apparently pulled a number out of the air, a big
number that will give their stock price a boost, while they
decide over the next few months what their real employment needs
will be for the new corporate structure."  He added that AT&T
employees and their families "will live in fear not knowing when
and where the ax will fall."  Mr. Bahr said that if AT&T wants to
ensure the success of the three spin-off companies, it should
work to improve employee morale instead of fostering "a climate
of bitterness."

          AT&T plans to file a "registration statement" with the
Securities and Exchange Commission late this month or early next
month for an initial public stock offering for the planned
systems and technology company.  An AT&T spokesman said the
company hopes to offer the stock by the end of the first quarter. 
In addition, AT&T last month asked the Internal Revenue Service
to issue a ruling allowing it to distribute stock in the new
systems and technology company tax-free to AT&T shareholders.  An
IRS ruling against AT&T's proposal could "complicate" plans to
spin off the systems and technology company and force AT&T to
"revisit" the spin-off plans, an AT&T spokesman told TR.

Time Warner Closes Acquisition of Cablevision

          Time Warner, Inc., has closed its acquisition of Cablevision
Industries, Inc., a transaction that positions it to offer
additional video and telephony services in several states.  Time
Warner gained about 1.3 million cable TV subscribers, bringing
its total subscription to 11.5 million customers.  The deal,
announced last year as a stock transaction valued at $2.7 billion
(TR, February 13, 1995), also allows Time Warner to complete its
cable TV "clustering" plan.

          "Our dramatically strengthened cable clusters will keep Time
Warner in the forefront of the core cable business as we roll out
enhanced advertising, pay-per-view, cable online services,
telecommunications services, and interactivity throughout the
systems," said Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer.  He added that as a result of the transaction,
more than three-quarters of Time Warner's customers will be
located in 34 groupings of more than 100,000 customers each.  The
Cablevision properties will augment Time Warner's existing cable
TV holdings in New York, Florida, and North Carolina, he said.

AT&T To Sell Circuit Board Plant in Restructuring

          AT&T Corp. will sell its Microelectronics business unit's
circuit board manufacturing plant in Richmond, Va., as part of a
plan to reduce its workforce and close or sell certain facilities
(see separate story).  AT&T announced last year that it will
divide itself into three separate companies focusing on
telecommunications services, systems and technologies, and
computer manufacturing (TR, Sept. 25, 1995).  The Richmond plant,
which manufactures printed circuit boards and "backplanes," has
about 1,950 employees.  Printed circuit boards, also called
printed wiring boards, contain several layers of wiring paths to
connect integrated circuits and other electronic components. 
Backplanes connect circuit boards within electronic devices.

          AT&T said it hopes that few, if any, of the employees will
lose their jobs under new ownership.  "We plan to initiate
discussions with potential buyers in the next few weeks," said
AT&T Microelectronics President Curtis J. Crawford.  "We hope to
find a company that is committed to keeping the
Richmond...workforce substantially intact."  He added that the
largest customer of the plant's products, AT&T Network Systems,
"expects to continue to depend upon the Richmond Works as a major
supplier after the sale."

          Tommy Thurston, President of Local 2260 of the
Communications Workers of America--which represents nonmanagement
employees at the plant--said, "We had just turned the corner on
making the plant profitable for the first time in a long time,
and this is the thanks we get."  A CWA spokesman in Washington
said union officials have been assured that CWA will have
"successorship rights" under a new owner, allowing it to continue
as the employee's bargaining agent.  But it is uncertain whether
the union's three-year contract, negotiated last summer with
AT&T, would continue to apply.

          AT&T Microelectronics will become part of the systems and
technology company to be spun off from AT&T on Jan. 1, 1997. 
Asked to explain why AT&T is selling the Richmond plant, a
spokesman for the business unit said company planners have
decided that "there's no strategic advantage in owning the
factory."  

          "When we look at how Microelectronics should invest our
resources for the greatest leverage and competitive advantage, we
find it makes more sense to invest in some of our other
businesses...Historically AT&T has been extremely vertically
oriented--we tended to make everything we needed," the spokesman
said.  "But over the years, we've reevaluated and asked whether
we really need to be making these [products] ourselves.  In the
case of these circuit boards, we decided we didn't."

          He added that AT&T hopes to complete the sale by year-end. 
Ideally, the buyer would be a company already manufacturing
circuit boards and seeking to expand both its market share and
manufacturing capacity, he said.  An industry source told TR that
talks with one potential buyer are well advanced.  "I've heard
that the negotiations are down to the final wrangling over
price," the source said.

Shareholders Approve Disney-CapCities/ABC Deal

          Shareholders of The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC,
Inc., overwhelmingly have approved Disney's planned acquisition
of CapCities (TR, Aug. 7, 1995).  The deal still requires
approval by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, whose
review could be delayed by the partial shutdown of the federal
government.  

          It also requires FCC approval of the transfer of certain
television licenses.  One observer last week told TR that the FCC
had intended to act on the license transfers at a scheduled Jan.
18 open meeting, which may be postponed.  Justice review of the
deal is expected to follow the FCC's action.  Disney is involved
in the Americast joint video programming venture with Ameritech
Corp., BellSouth Corp., SBC Communications, Inc., and GTE Corp.
(TR, Oct. 23, 1995).

Md. PSC Adopts `Phase II' Competition Rules;
CLECs Praise `Favorable' Interconnection Rates

          In a decision praised immediately by competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commission
has established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions for
carriers planning to compete in the provision of services to
business end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.
8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission said
that "an essential service such as interconnection should not be
priced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commission
are "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlined
terms for offering unbundled network elements, established an
interim local number portability method, and began a separate
proceeding on universal service issues.

          The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the state
in 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application for
permission to provide local exchange service (TR, May 2, 1994). 
In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, it
established interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensation
for call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland to
interconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem and
central office switching facilities.

          In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantic
had proposed an interconnection rate structure consisting of
three parts:  (1) a per-minute rate mirroring intrastate,
interexchange access charges, minus the carrier common line
charge; (2) a monthly per-line rate designed to capture the
difference between the revenues received from the per-minute rate
and Bell Atlantic's costs for building a "ubiquitous network" in
the state; and (3) a universal service component to be determined
in the universal service proceeding.

          Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"
should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on the
co-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnection
rates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,
citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitous
network" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier of
last resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all local
exchange service providers be required to charge each other the
same cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued that
establishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient and
would promote fair competition.

          Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," the
commission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection rates
paid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not full
recovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedent
certainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recover
joint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples in
excess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," the
PSC said.  

          It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"
intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data on
traffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specific
interconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.

          The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnection
provided at tandem switching offices, saying that such
interconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted a
rate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection at
Bell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU for
interconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay the
same 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on the
CLEC's networks.

          Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previous
interim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. 
In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companies
have in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnection
but have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating calls
that originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.

          Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it had
proposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would have
allowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on Bell
Atlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  The flat-
rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' true
cost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport's
proposal, however, noting that most parties preferred an MOU-
based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-rate
arrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commission
said it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based rate
system before reconsidering other rate schemes.

          The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of Bell
Atlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFS
and Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundled
voice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on those
trials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939
and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business links
and services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  The
commission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directing
the telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a rate
structure proposed by the PSC's staff.

          Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be set
at levels that would be less than or equal to the price of
equivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, the
commission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the prices
for unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios between
the direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That will
allow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of the
amount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone service
rates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs to
compete, the PSC reasoned.

PSC Bans Bundling of InterLATA Services

          To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlantic
operates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATA (local
access and transport area) services bundled with local exchange
services.  CLECs had contended that new entrants should be able
to offer such service packages because Bell Atlantic retains
significant competitive advantages over them.  The PSC said new
market entrants may provide interLATA services but cannot package
them with local exchange service until the interLATA line-of-
business restriction on Bell companies is removed.  CLECs were
allowed to delay providing equal access for intraLATA toll calls
until Bell Atlantic is required to do so.  The PSC also:

          *  Directed Bell Atlantic to file tariffs to offering remote
call-forwarding as an interim number portability system,
determining that rates for that service should be priced at the
incremental network costs of providing it; 

          *  Allowed CLECs to adjust their local calling area
boundaries; and

          *  Gave CLECs the option of (1) providing their own trunks
connecting their end offices to Bell Atlantic emergency "911"
tandems or (2) purchasing trunks from the telco at tariffed
rates.

          The commission denied AT&T Corp.'s request that it set
interim "wholesale" rates for resale of local exchange services,
citing the need for further study.  AT&T has sought authority to
provide local exchange services to business and residential users
in the state (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  The commission is scheduled to
discuss AT&T's application Jan. 17, a PSC spokesman said.                                                             

          A separate proceeding was initiated to explore universal
service issues.  The commission noted, however, that the decision
to launch that proceeding is not a "predetermination that a
universal service fee of some sort will be necessary."  The PSC
will examine whether Bell Atlantic needs a "special" level of
support to serve some customers, but it said, "The evidence
presented in this proceeding leaves us believing that far from
being a negative factor in its operations, the ubiquitous nature
of Bell Atlantic's network in Maryland presents [the telco] with
marketing and business advantages not enjoyed by its
competitors."

          Growth of the local exchange market also should provide Bell
Atlantic with competitive opportunities even if competitors
capture some market share, it added.

          Dan Whelan, President of Bell Atlantic-Maryland, said the
commission recognized that the telco is at a competitive
disadvantage until it can compete in additional interexchange
markets.  The order, however, left "many questions unanswered,
not the least of which is how Bell Atlantic-Maryland can continue
to provide affordable service to all Marylanders when the new
competitors serve only the lucrative business markets," Mr.
Whelan said.  The decision "significantly lowers many of the
technical and economic barriers to local exchange competition,"
said Larry Burgden, Vice President and General Manager for
Teleport's Maryland network.  But "full-blown competition will
not exist in Maryland until the [PSC] acts on other items before
it, such as number portability," he added.

exchange competition rules.  

          A "working group" of industry, commission, Office of
Consumer Counsel, and consumer group representatives recently
proposed local exchange competition rules to the PUC, pursuant to
a state telecom law enacted last year (TR, May 8 and Dec. 11,

Ameritech-Michigan Proposes Local Exchange Resale Rates

          Ameritech-Michigan has filed an intrastate tariff proposing
rates for the resale of its local exchange services in Michigan. 
The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,
offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some network
services.  Discounts would vary for different network elements
and services and would increase with volume and term commitments,
an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject to
PSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.

          Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting the
requirements of the recently passed Michigan Telecommunications
Act (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%
wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. 
Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on local
usage rates for residential services and 11% discount on local
usage rates for business services.  The discount rate for
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services would
be 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritech
spokeswoman said.

          Competitors also would be able to purchase for resale such
enhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, as well as
advanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN (integrated
services digital network) offerings.  Wholesale discounts would
allow competitors to operate without having to build their own
facilities, giving them "an avenue for entering the marketplace
rapidly," said Jim Wilkes, President of Ameritech-Michigan.

          Meanwhile, AT&T announced last week that it plans to compete
with Ameritech and other local exchange carriers in Wisconsin,
pending the adoption of local exchange competition rules by that
state's Public Service Commission.  AT&T said it initially would
provide service through resale but eventually would offer
facilities-based service.  The company wants to enter the market
by the middle of this year.  "Based upon the [Wisconsin] PSC's
recent decision giving customers the ability to choose the short-
haul long distance provider of their choice, we're confident that
the PSC also will rule in favor of maximum competition," said
Bonnie Manzi, AT&T Vice President-central region.  She called on
the PSC to adopt rules fostering "commercially feasible resale"
of local exchange service and "reasonable" network
interconnection arrangements.

Wireless Industry Pledges To Resolve
Hearing-Aid Compatibility Problems

          Conceding that all digital wireless communications systems
potentially may cause interference to hearing aids, wireless
industry representatives have pledged to develop ways to make
their services accessible to the 6 million U.S. wearers of such
devices.  During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4 in
Washington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipment
manufacturers and service providers should have the flexibility
to determine what transmission technologies they will use in the
future.  But the Commission must ensure that people with
disabilities have access to telecom services, he added.

          Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called the
European model of mandating the use of specific digital wireless
technologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us into
mandating their particular technology for the use of the
airwaves," he said.  But market forces will not necessarily lead
to the resolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must be
ready to protect the interests of groups that traditionally have
wielded little power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.

          Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacy
groups should work together to identify compatibility problems,
he continued.  "This will be a continuous process because
repeatedly we will find incompatibilities between wireless
devices and hearing aids."  He said the Commission anticipates
that specific "action items" will be generated by the two-day
summit meeting, which was sponsored by the Personal
Communications Industry Association.

          The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year by
hearing-aid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested that
the FCC initiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systems
using the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital
wireless standard to interfere with hearing aids (TR, June 12,
1995).  Wireless industry representatives, however, told the
Commission that it would be premature to launch such a rulemaking
proceeding before conclusive test results were available (TR,
July 24, 1995).

          During last week's meeting industry representatives
emphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibility
already is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, reported that the Center for the Study of
Electromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will release
the initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also is
conducting a field evaluation of bystander interference problems
using the personal communications service (PCS) network recently
activated in the Washington, D.C., area by American Personal
Communications.  Results of that research are expected to be
available Feb. 15.  Mr. Wheeler said digital-service interference
problems are no more daunting than those the cellular industry
faced when it introduced analog wireless equipment more than 10
years ago.

          Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wireless
phones meet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,
CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids that
are designed and tested to meet the requirements of the European
Commission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard for
hearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised a
technical standard for phones based on the code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers can
turn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,
which can be a source of interference for some types of hearing
aids.

          According to panelists at the meeting, several devices are
available that enable hearing-impaired people to use digital
telephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, for
example, can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-
coil" (t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on the
hearing aid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals to
use the mobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a
"JABRA" device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearing
aids.

          George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,
said the availability of such devices does not mean the wireless
industry should stop developing other alternatives for people
with disabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or they
will pay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some
22 million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "and
there isn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough to
ignore 10% of the population."

          Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted its
responsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wireless
technologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs,
who wears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientific
research will provide us with long-term solutions for resolving
electromagnetic compatibility issues."

          Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,
Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research and
development arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a Senior
Engineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)
transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aid
interference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitude
modulated, he explained.  Such pulse signals are common with
mobile phones based on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said,
adding that all PCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitude
modulation.  "Higher RF output increases the range of
interference, but that is why the FCC has set limits on output
levels," Mr. Williams said.

          Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering for
the Advanced Products and Technology Division of the Cellular
Subscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving from
the use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to the
use of several antennas with low-power radios.  That will lead
manufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devices
that can minimize radio interference problems, he said.

Alcatel Wins Multimillion-Dollar PCS Contract

          Alcatel Network Systems has signed a "multimillion-dollar"
agreement with the Sprint Telecommunications Venture (STV) to
supply equipment and relocation services to incumbent licensees
operating microwave systems in the 2 gigahertz spectrum band.  An
Alcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, but
he said the deal could be worth millions of dollars, considering
that Sprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS)
in up to 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services,
Sprint must pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbent
licensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.

          Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrum
relocation projects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Last
year STV won PCS licenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, and
Indianapolis "Major Trading Areas" (TR, March 20, 1995).  Alcatel
plans to supply incumbents with new radio equipment designed to
operate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haul equipment
interconnecting cell sites.

          Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell Mobile
Services, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipment
for the spectrum relocation of public safety wireless facilities
operated by the County of Santa Barbara, Calif.  The Alcatel
spokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spend about $1 million
to relocate five microwave links for the county.  That estimate
is in line with other industry estimates, which put the cost of
relocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.  Alcatel-
-which has submitted bids to all PCS licensees planning to
upgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects to announce similar
relocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. and BellSouth
Personal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  He said there
is a roughly $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.

Washington Commission Clarifies Local Competition Rules

          Responding to requests by several potential local exchange
market entrants, the Washington Utilities and Transportation
Commission has amended rules for local exchange competition
adopted last November (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The potential local
exchange competitors had asked the commission to modify several
rule provisions and to clarify that GTE Northwest, Inc., is
required to file tariffs for unbundled local loop and number
portability offerings.  The commission denied requests that GTE
and US WEST Communications, Inc., be required to offer all of
their services for resale.

          In the November order, the commission had directed US WEST
to file an unbundled loop tariff, but that order had not
mentioned GTE.  In a Dec. 27 order, the commission clarified that
GTE also must file an unbundled loop tariff within 30 days.  The
tariff must offer line-side interconnection and two-wire
interconnection from an end-user's facility to the GTE central
office.  The commission also granted requests by Teleport
Communications Group, Inc., and Electric Lightwave, Inc., that it
require GTE to file an interim number portability tariff within
30 days.  Rates for that service must be set at GTE's incremental
costs.

          The commission said further network unbundling--beyond that
needed to make unbundled loops and line-side interconnection
available--likely will be necessary, but "an immediate need for
more extensive unbundling was not shown in this docket."  It
rejected requests from AT&T Corp. and MCI Telecommunications
Corp. that US WEST and GTE be directed to file a "generally
available tariff for any elements unbundled for any competitor in
response to a bona fide request."

          Competitors also had asked the commission to require that US
WEST offer a four-wire facility, rather than a two-wire facility,
for its unbundled network offerings.  They had argued that a two-
wire facility would limit the ability of competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs) to provide business and data services
and that four-wire facilities are needed to offer digital
services.  The commission said, however, that two-wire loops will
allow CLECs to serve the "vast majority of residential customers
and business customers without having to buy bundled [US WEST]
services or facilities."  

          AT&T and MCI also had asked the commission to require that
incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) remove all restrictions
on local exchange service resale.  The interexchange carriers
said their ability to compete in local exchange markets depends
on their ability to resell the incumbent LECs' bundled and
tariffed services.  US WEST had argued, meanwhile, that the
record in the proceeding did not support any action directing
LECs to offer all services for resale.  The commission ruled that
although the general prohibition on resale should be eliminated,
any such action should be considered as part of a general rate
case.

          AT&T called the commission's Dec. 27 order "another step
toward achieving the goal of widespread local competition in
Washington."  Greg Allen, AT&T Vice President-government affairs,
added, "Expanding competition in local telephone service is in
the public interest, since it will mean more features, faster
innovation and better value--all the things that customers
currently enjoy in the competitive long distance market."

US WEST Meets Colo. Party-Line Conversion Deadline

          Avoiding a potential revenue loss of $550,000 a month, US
WEST Communications, Inc., has converted all Colorado multi-party
lines to single-party service, meeting a Dec. 31 deadline.  The
conversions were required by the Public Utilities Commission's
orders in the second phase of the Rural Facilities Improvement
Program (TR, Feb. 8, 1993; and Dec. 11, 1995).  The company
earlier had sought a waiver from the requirement, indicating that
it did not expect to complete the conversions last month.  The
PUC had been considering late last year whether to direct US WEST
to eliminate "tariff riders" which allow the telco to recover the
cost of the conversions.  The rider charges on subscribers' bills
represent $550,000 in monthly revenues, a US WEST spokesman told
TR.  US WEST said its employees made an "extraordinary effort" to
complete the upgrades by Dec. 31.

Time Warner Seeks Mediation in Ameritech Talks

          Expressing frustration over Ameritech-Ohio's intransigence
in talks on interconnection terms, Time Warner Communications has
asked the Ohio Public Utilities Commission to mediate the
negotiations.  Time Warner said agreement has been reached on
"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snag
over "economic" issues.  Last summer the PUC gave Time Warner
authority to provide local exchange services in the 37 counties
where it operates cable TV systems (TR, Aug. 28, 1995).  Time
Warner requested PUC mediation in its second 60-day report to the
commission on the status of its interconnection negotiations with
Ameritech and other telephone companies.

          Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for Time
Warner, said negotiations with Ameritech began in December 1994. 
An interconnection agreement must be concluded "by the parties
with commission intervention, or by commission directive, by mid-
January 1996 or the promise of local telephone competition in
Ohio will be even further delayed," she said.  Ameritech appears
"unable or unwilling to negotiate" a reasonable resolution of the
remaining issues, Ms. Schermer said.

          In its request for mediation, Time Warner said, "Some
[Ameritech] charges for key services, for which there are not
current substitutes, are excessive."  Ameritech also has failed
to provide "cost justifications" and has proposed some one-time
charges that are "not appropriate," Time Warner added.  

          It appears that Ameritech's negotiating team, which
represents its Information Industry Services (AIIS) unit, is
"hindered by a lack of authority to revise and modify proposals,"
it told the commission.  Negotiations were "unilaterally
terminated" for several months in May 1995 by "someone at
Ameritech," Time Warner said, adding, "that decision did not
appear to be a decision of AIIS."

          In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by
"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriate
insistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a manner
which insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." 
Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remaining
issues, "if Time Warner is serious."

          It suggested that Time Warner may have other motives for
filing its mediation request.  James C. Smith, the telco's Vice
President, pointed to the "combination of Time Warner raising new
issues at the bargaining table, publicly complaining to the
[PUC], and conducting a media blitz."  Time Warner appears to be
employing a "tactic to create negative publicity" in an effort to
"stall finalization of our cable TV franchise agreement" in
Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Smith said.  Time Warner officials seem "more
intent on delaying competition in the cable TV market than
negotiating seriously to resolve issues so they can provide local
telephone service," he added.

Brooks Fiber, NYNEX Reach Interconnection Pact

          Brooks Fiber Communications has reached an interim agreement
to interconnect with NYNEX-New England's local exchange network
in Springfield, Mass.  The companies set reciprocal compensation
rates for call termination and agreed on an interim local number
portability arrangement.  The pact paves the way for Brooks to
offer local exchange service on an interim basis, pending the
development of permanent interconnection rules by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities later this year,
Brooks said.  The company plans to begin providing such service
in Springfield early this year.

          "The NYNEX co-carrier agreement was the last major hurdle in
providing local dial-tone [service] in Springfield," said Robert
J. Shanahan, Vice President-northern region for Brooks.  The
company already has a fiber optic network in place and has
ordered an AT&T 5ESS-2000 switch for installation there.  The
interconnection agreement mirrors three others signed by NYNEX
with competitive local exchange carriers in Massachusetts, a
NYNEX spokesman said.

Court Tells Pa. PUC To Rethink Price Cap Index

          A recent ruling by Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court on Bell
Atlantic-Pennsylvania's intrastate price cap plan could lead to
rate reductions for the telephone company's customers.  The court
overturned part of a Public Utility Commission order establishing
a price cap formula for Bell Atlantic, freeing the company from
rate-of-return regulation.  It ruled that the PUC had not taken
into account the difference between the general inflation rate
and the specific inflation rate for economic inputs used by the
telephone company.

          State Consumer Advocate Irwin Popowsky, among others, had
challenged the June 1994 commission order that established an
inflation "offset" factor of 2.93% for the telco's price cap
formula.  The commission's order forbade any rate increases
through 1999 and required the telco to reduce rates if the annual
inflation rate (as measured by the gross domestic product price
index, or GDP-PI) falls below 2.93%.  When the company eventually
is allowed to increase rates, those increases must be limited to
the GDP-PI minus 2.93%.  Rate decreases will continue to be
required whenever the GDP-PI is below 2.93%.

          The court, while rejecting some of the Consumer Advocate's
arguments for a higher offset factor, agreed in its ruling late
last month that the figure fails to reflect Bell Atlantic's
"input price differential."  The inflation rate for Bell
Atlantic's inputs is lower than the GDP-PI, Mr. Popowsky told TR. 
Although the PUC had agreed in principle that there was a
differential, it had not been able to determine the correct
figure.  So the commission effectively had set the differential
at zero by not accounting for it in calculating the offset
factor, Mr. Popowsky said.

          The PUC has not yet decided whether to appeal the court's
decision, commission attorney Alan Kohler said.  Other parties
that had challenged the commission's order include AT&T Corp.,
MCI Telecommunications Corp., the Pennsylvania Cable &
Telecommunications Association, the Central Atlantic Payphone
Association, and the city of Pittsburgh.

Brooks Fiber Acquires Engineering, Consulting Company

          Competitive local exchange carrier Brooks Fiber Properties,
Inc., has acquired the domestic consulting and engineering
business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service"
telecommunications provider, the company said.  Brooks
Telecommunications had owned 15% of Brooks Fiber, a company
spokesman said.

          The move will give Brooks Fiber engineering and software
expertise, allowing it to offer customers a "new depth of
consultative support," according to James C. Allen, Chief
Executive Officer of the company.  Acquiring the domestic
consulting unit--dubbed GLA International, Inc.--will give Brooks
Fiber more "management information systems" (MIS) capabilities,
improving its ability to meet interexchange carrier (IXC)
customers' service requirements, Mr. Allen said.  IXCs have
"voiced perpetual disappointment with MIS shortcomings of the
older [local exchange carriers]," he added.  Brooks Fiber
"strongly supports GLA's incumbent senior management.  We have no
intentions of [implementing] significant changes in GLA's present
course, including current staffing levels," Mr. Allen said. 
Brooks Fiber now will have about 300 employees and could have
revenues of more than $40 million in 1996, the company said.

AT&T Slams RHCs' `Generic Me-Too' Waiver Pleas

          AT&T Corp. has opposed granting the Bell companies "generic
me-too" waivers that would extend to them all previous waivers of
the line-of-business restrictions contained in the 1982 antitrust
consent decree.  In a recent letter to the Justice Department's
Antitrust Division, AT&T said the Bell companies have made no
attempt to show that their requests for "wholesale" decree relief
do not raise "different factual and legal issues" than those
considered when the initial waivers were granted.  In many cases,
the original waivers were granted only because they were
justified for a particular Bell company in a particular
circumstance, AT&T said.

          Bell Atlantic Corp. filed the first generic me-too waiver
request late last year, seeking decree relief equal to that
granted by the U.S. District Court in Washington in all previous
waiver orders (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).  Bell Atlantic volunteered to
abide by all terms and conditions set by the court in those
orders.  Since then, several other Bell regional holding
companies (RHCs)--including BellSouth Corp., US WEST, Inc., SBC
Communications, Inc., and NYNEX Corp.--have sought the
department's support for similar waivers.

          Those companies "have simply asserted--without any analysis
or support--that the wholesale extension of all previously
approved waivers to them `does not raise any factual or legal
issues that are significantly different from those raised by the
previously approved waivers' themselves," AT&T told the
department.  "But [that] assertion is false."  

          Although it acknowledged that some Bell companies may be
justified in seeking me-too waivers in specific cases, AT&T
stated that many existing waivers were granted by the court
"solely because they would apply to only one" Bell company and
would not be extended to others.

          As an example, it cited the court's 1989 decision to allow
Pacific Telesis Group to acquire a 10% interest in a transpacific
cable system.  AT&T said that waiver likely would not have been
granted had the court believed that each of the seven RHCs later
would be allowed to obtain equal 10% shares, thus allowing them
collectively to control 70% of the cable system.  

          "Similarly, the prior waiver orders that authorized de
minimis foreign exchange or private line services across LATA
[local access and transport area] boundaries generally rested on
a ground unique to the [Bell company that] requested the waiver,"
AT&T added.

APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Interference Problems

          American Personal Communications has rejected claims that
its personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering
with the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a
recent letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration
(MTA) stated that the new wireless service has caused "serious
interference" to the communications operations of light rail and
bus services operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations. 
The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

          Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs,
expressed concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to
"politicize" the effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to
other spectrum bands.  The relocation of incumbent operators has
been a contentious issue since the FCC first drafted rules
requiring 2 GHz licensees to clear that band to make way for new
PCS licensees (TR, Sept. 21, 1992; and July 19, 1993).  The
Commission recently clarified rules adopted in the Engineering
and Technology docket 92-9 "emerging technologies" proceeding,
further defining "good faith" negotiations over relocation issues
between licensees (TR, Oct. 16, 1995).

          The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter
stated.  The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs
incurred as a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman
Anthony Brown declined to comment further on the interference
problems, noting that it involves "a possible issue of
litigation."

            Ms. Schelle told TR that interference problems with the
mass transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to
the MTA, an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have
reported no public-safety problems resulting from interference
between the two radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a
responsibility to respond to frequency coordination notices in a
timely manner, the attorney added.  

          The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that
APC planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials
failed to respond to a single one.

          "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are
informed of the complete parameters of those facilities'
operations.  APC fully protected the facilities represented on
MTA's FCC license and could not have known, without being
informed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance from those
parameters."

Federal Employees Expected To Return To Work;
FCC Issues Public Notice on Filing Deadlines

          Thousands of federal employees were expected to return to
work this week as congressional leaders took steps late last week
to approve a measure restoring the government's ability to pay
them.  About 280,000 federal employees had been furloughed, and
480,000 others had worked for three weeks without pay.  At TR's
Friday news deadline, the House passed, 401-17, a GOP-sponsored
"targeted continuing appropriations" measure (HR 1643) to end the
21-day partial government shutdown resulting from failed budget
negotiations between President Clinton and congressional leaders. 
The measure also was expected last Friday to receive Senate
approval and a Presidential signature.

          If enacted, the measure would allow employees to collect
current and back pay, but it would not provide the funding that
federal agencies need to operate.  Late Friday afternoon,
however, House leaders took up another proposal to fund
government operations through Jan. 26.  If enacted, that measure
will not take effect until President Clinton submits a balanced
budget proposal that has been "scored" by the Congressional
Budget Office.

          Earlier last week the House failed to override President
Clinton's veto of HR 2076, which would have provided fiscal year
1996 funding for the Commerce Department and other federal
agencies, including the FCC.  Lawmakers voted 240-to-159, falling
short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto.

          The GOP measure adopted by the House last Friday represents
only a temporary truce in the ongoing budget battle.  It would
guarantee the payment of government workers' salaries through
Jan. 26, when another continuing resolution may be required. 
Office of Management and Budget officials told TR that the
Republican-sponsored measure would permit all furloughed
employees to return to work.  OMB also planned to furnish federal
agencies with guidelines specifying what activities those
employees could perform while appropriations bills are pending.

          Other government sources told TR that the FCC would be able
to conduct a substantial portion of its regular business
activities, despite the continuing appropriations lapse. 
"Basically, the FCC regulates, and that doesn't cost the
government anything," one source told TR.  The Commission should
be able to adopt orders and conduct rulemaking proceedings as
usual, the source said, adding that FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt
wants to proceed with its scheduled Jan. 18 public meeting.  That
meeting appeared to be in jeopardy as long as the partial
shutdown persisted, but the Chairman wants to conduct as much
business as possible once FCC staffers return to work, TR's
source said.

          Anticipating the government's reopening, the FCC Jan. 5
released a public notice revising document-filing deadlines.  All
documents due to be filed with the agency during the shutdown
"will be due no later than 5:30 p.m. on the second day after the
Commission reopens," the notice stated.  "Documents received
during the government shutdown via mail...will be deemed filed on
the first day that the Commission is authorized to reopen," it
stated.  Upcoming filing deadlines will remain in effect unless
the Commission or its bureaus decide otherwise, the notice added.

          GOP leaders predicted last Friday that the House would
approve the second resolution to fund the FCC, the Commerce
Department, and other federal agency operations.  That measure,
however, would not take effect until President Clinton submitted
a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) said last Friday.

          Meanwhile, the government spending freeze could remain in
effect this week.  And although federal employees are expected to
be paid their regular salaries through Jan. 26, government
contract workers are not covered under the measure restoring
federal workers' pay.  In effect, FCC employees could return to
work, but they may not be authorized to spend government money to
do their jobs.  It remained unclear at TR's deadline what
functions the employees would be able to perform under the
expected OMB guidelines.

          Harris Miller, President of the Information Technology
Association of America (ITAA), told President Clinton that the
interim GOP measure was "outrageous."  He said:  "While we are
pleased this proposal helps federal workers, the plan is both
short-sighted and unfair."  In a Jan. 5 letter he criticized
Congress for treating federal contractors as "second-class
citizens."  ITAA represents some 6,700 companies that provide
communications services to government agencies and private-sector
businesses.

          On Friday President Clinton renewed his pledge to submit a
balanced budget plan to Congress.  "I gave them my word I would
work with them to pass a plan which would bring our federal
budget into balance in seven years," he said as the House began
debating the plan to reopen parts of the government.  The
President said he was "ready" and "willing" to continue budget
negotiations with congressional leaders.

          While the FCC remained closed last week, "essential" staff
in the wireless bureau and several attorneys in the Office of the
General Counsel were working.  OMB previously had exempted staff
members in the wireless bureau's Auctions Division from the
shutdown.  Attorneys working on FCC briefs for cases pending in
federal courts also were deemed essential by OMB.

FCC AUCTION REVENUES CONTINUE GROWING

          The FCC's sale of radio licenses resumed last week despite
the federal government shutdown, which concluded its third week
last Friday.  The auction of "multipoint distribution service"
(MDS) licenses ended the week with net revenues of nearly $80
million.  Licenses for the New York, Washington, D.C., and
Fayetteville, N.C., markets attracted the highest bids.  The sale
of 900 megahertz "specialized mobile radio" (SMR) licenses
garnered more than $62.3 million in net bids.  

          The three most active markets were Charlotte, N.C.,
Philadelphia, and Tampa, Fla.  And net bids in the "C" block
auction of personal communications service (PCS) licenses totaled
$1.3 billion.  North Coast Mobile Communications, Inc., bid $225
million for the New York "Basic Trading Area," while
PersonalConnect Communications, Inc., bid more than $120 million
for the Los Angeles BTA and more than $75 million for the Chicago
BTA.

Arianespace Gears Up for Increased Launch Demand

          Arianespace, Inc., is gearing up now to meet the expected
increased demand for launch services in the coming years, a
company spokeswoman said last week.  Arianespace recently
unveiled plans to order additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launch
vehicles to meet the growing demand.  It plans to establish its
own finance company to help clients fund satellite launches, the
spokeswoman added.  Its insurance unit, S3R, also will be
reactivated to help market the Ariane 5, the company's more
powerful, next-generation rocket.

          Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches will
grow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  The
company plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70
satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans would
involve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. 
In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4
rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.

          The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergo
two technical verification flights in May and September of this
year, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially by
the end of the year if all goes well.  Meanwhile, fueling
problems on the launch of Malaysia's first national satellite,
MEASAT, forced Arianespace to scrap a Jan. 9 launch date.  The
Ariane 4 rocket also was to deploy PanAmSat Corp.'s PanAmSat 3R
satellite.  A new launch date is expected to be announced this
week, the spokeswoman said.

S&P Revises Financial Guidelines for Wireless Companies

          Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising the
financial guidelines it applies to ratings of wireless
communications companies.  The business risks associated with
cellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to the
extent that many firms can sustain less stringent financial
ratios for the same credit ratings as companies in other
industries, S&P concluded last week.  The new guidelines apply to
cellular and personal communications service (PCS) companies,
although PCS operators are expected to face many of the same
start-up risks as the early cellular companies.

          That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhat worse-
than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringent
financial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It cited
dramatic growth in cellular subscribership as the reason that
business-risk profiles of cellular companies have improved.

          The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be used
to assess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecom
companies that own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  These
include AT&T Corp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holding
companies, and major independent telecom companies such as GTE
Corp.  "Although the wireless segment does not represent a
majority of these companies' assets, it is their fastest growing
segment," S&P observed.  "Under the revised benchmarks, companies
with significant cellular holdings are now viewed as being
somewhat less risky, while those with a major commitment to PCS
are viewed as still having significant credit risk for the PCS
portion of their wireless business." 

          S&P will use the following measurements to determine the
credit ratings of wireless communications companies:

          *  Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement of
income before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--that
indicates "earnings protection."

          *  EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement of
cellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relative
to total i nterest cost.  This measures a company's minimum
ability to meet interest costs using available cash.

          *  The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relative
to cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determine
a company's debt "exposure" relative to cash flow.

          *  Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt to
total "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continue
to be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimate
generally the asset value of a particular market.  The debt-per-
pop ratio indicates some degree of financial flexibility.

          *  Debt per subscriber.  As the number of cellular
subscribers increases, S&P believes a more meaningful measurement
of financial risk may be the ratio of debt to the number of
subscribers.  This is because part of a cellular company's
revenues are used to service debt costs.

          In determining the business risk profile of wireless
carriers, S&P considers a number of market factors, including
capital intensity, barriers to entry, competing technologies,
economic conditions, marketing costs, "churn" rates (which
measure the loss of subscribers to competitors), and the
unregulated nature of the industry.  For more information about
S&P's wireless financial guidelines, call Timothy E. Caffrey at
212/208-1750.

Pacific Bell Seeks Approval for ISDN Rate Hike

          Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities
Commission for permission to double the per-minute rates for its
integrated services digital network (ISDN) service and to add a
$125 installation fee.  The company said it needs the rate
increase--from 1 cent to 2 cents per minute--because of the
"exploding" demand for service in areas where it is costly to
install and maintain the service.

          ISDN use has until recently been concentrated near central
offices in metropolitan areas, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said. 
But she said the increase in consumer use of the Internet and
online services--along with increasing popularity of
telecommuting--has led to more residential installations.  The
company's current ISDN rates will remain in place pending the
PUC's decision, which could take six months or more, she added.

          ISDN service demand in California increased 200% during the
last 10 months, the spokeswoman said.  Pacific Bell has installed
about 60,000 ISDN lines in the state so far--about 30% of which
are in high-cost areas, she said.  A year ago only 5% of ISDN
installations were in high-cost areas (those three or more miles
from an ISDN-equipped central office).  By the year 2000, more
than 70% of California ISDN lines will be installed in
residential areas.  Pacific Bell must recoup its rising
installation costs, but it does not want to discourage potential
subscribers by implementing an even higher installation fee, the
spokeswoman said.  It also does not want to penalize residents of
high-cost areas by charging them more than it charges other ISDN
subscribers.

          In addition to implementing the $125 installation fee
throughout its service area, Pacific Bell would begin levying
per-minute charges during off-peak, night, and weekend hours.  It
plans to end its provision of free ISDN use in all off-peak time
periods, substituting a variety of service packages offering a
combination of free and billable usage at various times, the
spokewoman said.  "We want to place the maximum amount of control
for billing in the customer's hands."

S.C. Regulators OK Price Cap Plan for BellSouth

          In adopting a price cap plan for BellSouth
Telecommunications, Inc., the South Carolina Public Service
Commission properly has "recognized the need" for alternative
regulation of local exchange carriers, a BellSouth official has
said.  Greg Morton, the company's Director-corporate and external
affairs for South Carolina, told TR, however, that a five-year
price freeze imposed on basic local service rates "is too long in
a competitive environment."  BellSouth had proposed a freeze of
only three years.  

          Mr. Morton added that BellSouth is "disappointed" that the
PSC included a 2.1% "productivity factor" in its price cap
formula, which was adopted by the commission Jan. 2.  "We felt
our plan" as originally proposed "had a built-in productivity
factor," in that BellSouth could "never go back and recover"
revenues from price increases it was forbidden to make during the
freeze, he said.

          After the plan's fifth year, the company will be allowed to
increase basic service rates by an amount equal to the rate of
inflation, minus the 2.1% productivity factor.  BellSouth's
intrastate switched access rates are capped for three years.  For
"nonbasic" (competitive and "discretionary," or optional)
services, the company will have pricing flexibility, subject to a
10% annual limit on rate increases.  The PSC will maintain
oversight authority and can refuse to allow rate increases, Mr.
Morton emphasized.

          BellSouth most likely will ask the commission to reconsider
parts of its decision regarding the productivity factor and the
five-year price freeze, he said.  He noted, however, that the
company has not reviewed the PSC's order yet, which has not been
released publicly yet.  BellSouth currently faces no basic local
exchange service competition in South Carolina, but there are
competitive providers of access and short-haul toll services, Mr.
Morton said.  Callers must use "dial-around" access codes to
reach BellSouth's competitors in the state's intraLATA (local
access and transport area) toll service market.

Intelsat Will Consider Restructuring Plan This Year

          By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have
"a better idea of the future structure" of the international
satellite consortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-
international and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat
Corp.  Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.
Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions the
board took at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.  A special
Intelsat "working party" and a "special committee" of the board
are exploring the future structure of the consortium, he
explained.  The working party will meet three times this year--
after each board meeting--to develop general policies based on
the board's decisions.  The special committee then will do the
"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.

          As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  The
board will review the support centers' performance at its March
1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open any
additional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.  Plans for improving
customer service also include restructuring Intelsat's sales and
marketing division and establishing new internal accounting
processes, he added.

          The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-A
series satellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-A
satellites will be deployed in February, and the last bird in the
series will be deployed later this year.  Work by Lockheed Martin
Corp. on the VIII series of satellites continues, and the board
recently approved a "minor modification" of the contract with
Lockheed that "won't affect the scheduled delivery," he added.

          The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805
satellite to provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "While
the current design of the Intelsat 805 satellite provides
sufficient land mass coverage over all of Africa, intersystem
coordination constraints may restrict the use of the Intelsat 805
satellite at 33 degrees East Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained. 
At the next meeting in Bangalore, India, slated for March 14-19,
the board will consider releasing a request for proposals for two
new satellites to replace two older, Intelsat VI satellites
covering the Indian Ocean region, he said.

          Commenting on financial matters, Mr. Mechanick said the
board approved Intelsat's 1996 budget, which projects $876
million in total revenues and $496 million in capital
expenditures.  Those figures represent a 10.8% increase in
revenues and a 25% decrease in capital expenditures from the 1995
budget.  He said preliminary figures show actual 1995 revenues
totaling $800 million, while operating expenses were $75,000
under budget.

Sprint Shareholders To Vote on Phoenix Deal 

          Sprint Corp. shareholders will meet Jan. 12 at the company's
Westwood, Kan., corporate headquarters to vote on three proposals
to consummate Sprint's alliance with France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom AG.  The "Phoenix" global services alliance won FCC
approval last month (TR, Dec. 18, 1995).  The deal calls for
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to invest $4.2 billion in
return for a 20% stake in Sprint.  Shareholders have been asked
to approve the investment agreement, related changes to Sprint's
charter and bylaws, and certain "control share acquisitions"
requirements under Kansas state law.  A Sprint official told TR
that the meeting should last only a few minutes because of
expected overwhelming approval of the company's proxy proposals.

Consumer Groups Want Conditions on Time Warner Deal

          Several consumer groups plan jointly to ask the FCC to
attach "severe conditions" on any regulatory approval related to
the proposed merger of Time Warner, Inc., and Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. (TR, Sept. 25 and Oct. 16, 1995).  The groups are
concerned that the proposed "mega-merger," which would create one
of the world's largest media companies, could result in excessive
media company concentration.  They are also worried that it could
limit video programming diversity.

          The request is contained in comments on an earlier, similar
request by the U.S. Telephone Association (TR, Dec. 11, 1995). 
The comments were prepared by the Media Access Project (MAP) on
behalf of the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for
Media Education.  The groups intended to file their comments last
week at the FCC; they will be submitted, instead, as soon as the
partial federal government shutdown concludes.  The groups
reiterated concerns raised in USTA's "request for imposition of
conditions."  They said Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) should
not be allowed to use its ownership stake in Turner Broadcasting
for anticompetitive purposes.  TCI is the nation's largest cable
TV company.  The groups also proposed that the FCC hold an en
banc hearing on issues raised by the proposed merger.

          The groups specifically are requesting that the FCC impose
conditions to ensure programming diversity and access and to
guard against anticompetitive conduct.  But they did not specify
exactly what form those conditions should take.  Conditions could
be attached to any television license transfers that must be
approved by the FCC for the transaction to be finalized, a MAP
source explained.  The FCC also may have the authority to impose
conditions on the provision of cable TV-related services by a
newly merged company, he added.

Court Should Consider Mtel License Separately, FCC Says

          The FCC has told the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
that it should not consider the Commission's licensing scheme for
private paging licensees in its deliberations on whether Mobile
Telecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a
license obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"
program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.
94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission's
authority to charge a $33 million fee for the company's
narrowband personal communications service (PCS) license without
first receiving congressional authority (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).

          During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is a
licensee in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newly
allocated frequency band," the agency explained, adding that all
other licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid
substantial sums for their licenses at a government auction.

          The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an
advanced two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge,
Mtel did not apply for a private paging license at 929-930
[megahertz]," it said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit
substantial amounts of money to its narrowband PCS licenses when
private paging licenses were `free' undercuts its assertion in
this court that the Commission is applying different rules to
identical licenses," the agency added.

Regulatory & Government Affairs: 19 local exchange carriers'
(LECs') proposal to rebalance their rates

          The Nebraska Public Service Commission will hear oral
arguments Jan. 8 on a motion by commission staff members to
"bifurcate" a proceeding on 19 local exchange carriers' (LECs')
proposal to rebalance their rates.  The companies proposed to add
a $2 subscriber line charge to customers' monthly bills and to
reduce access charges by $19 million annually.  M. Gene Hand, PSC
Director-communications, said the staff considers the proposed
change as a local rate increase, since it would not apply to all
LECs in the state.  In a separate proceeding, the PSC plans to
hold hearings around the state Jan. 29-Feb. 8 on a proposed
"consumer bill of rights" for the competitive local exchange
market...

AT OUR DEADLINE. . .

          ANNOUNCEMENT EXPECTED -- Unysis Corp. is expected to make an
announcement Monday, Jan. 8, regarding a "strategic" alliance to
provide telephone network management services.  Unysis would not
release details by TR's Friday news deadline, but a company
spokesman said Unysis will unveil a system to provide "real-time
network monitoring by capturing information from the Signalling
System No. 7 database" used in domestic telephone networks.  

          The major application for such a system, the company said,
is to detect phone fraud "as it is happening."  See today's
TRDaily for a full report on the alliance.

          COMPANY SEEKS AUCTION STAY -- CTA, Inc., of Rockville, Md.,
asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington to issue a stay
barring the FCC from proceeding with a Jan. 24 auction of two
construction permits for building and operating a direct
broadcast satellite (DBS) system (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).

          The company argued that the FCC has failed to consider steps
to encourage small business participation in the auction.  The
Appeals Court is expected to rule on the request before Jan. 19,
the date specified by the FCC for auction participants to submit
"upfront" payments.

          ALLTEL EXECUTIVE RETIRES -- ALLTEL Corp. said John E.
Steuri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of its ALLTEL
Information Services subsidiary, will retire May 31.  Mr. Steuri
has been CEO of the information services company since 1988. 
Formerly known as Systematics Information Services, the company
was acquired by ALLTEL in 1990.

Lead Story:
GE Satellite Unit Uses Gibraltar To Seek ITU Geostationary Slots

     GE Capital Satellites International, Inc., a subsidiary of
domestic satellite operator GE American Communications, Inc., has
announced an agreement with the government of Gibraltar to seek 12
geostationary orbital slots for satellite services to Europe,
Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.  

     The unit of General Electric Co. said the government of
Gibraltar has filed "applications for these orbital locations on
behalf of GE Capital Satellites International" with the
International Telecommunication Union.  "Satellites constructed and
launched to these locations would be operated from a planned
satellite control facility on Gibraltar," which is a British
dependent territory.

     A GE Americom spokesman told TRI that most of its proposed
satellites would operate in the Ku-band frequency with the
exception being one orbital slot covering the Pacific Ocean. 
Satellites covering Africa would operate in both C- and Ku-band
frequencies, he said.

     GE's statement said current plans envision using the
satellites mainly for video programming distribution, including
direct-to-home services and transmissions to cable TV system
headends and broadcast stations.  GE Americom said the planned
satellite design "would accommodate both analog and digital video
formats, as well as other uses, including VSAT [very small aperture
terminal] and data networks."

     To register plans to use geostationary orbital slots in
specific frequency bands, member government administrations notify
the ITU years in advance of government and business proposals for
new satellites.  Generally, administrations forward such
registration notices on behalf of national government entities or
companies under rules agreed to by ITU member nations.  

     In addition, the U.S. government notifies the ITU of Intelsat
satellite plans, and the United Kingdom government does the same
for new Inmarsat satellite proposals.  

     Previously, an agreement under which the Pacific island
Kingdom of Tonga registered slots for use by satellite operators
not based in Tonga led to calls for an update of the ITU "advance
notification" and registration procedures.  The ITU currently is
considering such reforms.

     Scott Blake Harris, Bureau Chief of the FCC's International
Bureau, told TRI that the bureau was not "surprised that a U.S.
corporation chose to file with the ITU through another
administration" rather than through the FCC.  

     He said, "Under no circumstances will we permit any enterprise
to be disadvantaged by having decided to file with the U.S. rather
than another administration."  GE Americom's spokesman could not
comment on the reasons for not filing with the FCC.  

     Mr. Harris said it is not clear that the agreement between GE
Americom and the government of Gibraltar is "improper or untoward." 
He noted that the move "may be appropriate," particularly "if they
don't intend to use the satellites to provide service to the U.S."

     Commenting on the need for ITU reforms, Mr. Harris said the
"whole ITU registration process is in serious disrepair.  I know
the ITU intends to look at it, but in my view, it's urgent that it
do so."  

     He added that "it's critical" that the ITU review include U.S.
government and industry participants.

Satellite Services:
New Loral Unit To Be Globalstar Managing Partner 

     As part of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $10 billion deal to acquire
most of Loral Corp., Globalstar L.P. will get a respected industry
leader to champion it in the "Big LEO" (low earth-orbit) mobile
satellite services market.  

     Bernard Schwartz, Chairman of Loral, will become Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Loral Space and Communications Corp., a
new company to be formed in connection with the Lockheed
Martin/Loral deal.  Loral Space will be the managing general
partner of Globalstar, inheriting Loral's 31% stake in Globalstar
as well as other assets.

     Mr. Schwartz is widely credited with building Loral from an
unprofitable company two decades ago into a multibillion-dollar
industry leader today through a series of strategic acquisitions. 
The addition of Mr. Schwartz to the Globalstar management team
diminishes a major criticism of the $2 billion project, said Robert
Kaimowitz, a satellite communications analyst at Unterberg Harris
in New York.  Globalstar has been criticized for lacking a focused
management team, Mr. Kaimowitz noted.  

     Mr. Schwartz said at a Jan. 8 press conference announcing the
deal that he plans to focus most of his time on Globalstar.  Having
Mr. Schwartz championing Globalstar "strengthens" the global
communications project, Mr. Kaimowitz said, adding that Mr.
Schwartz's involvement "ensures that the system will be built."

     Globalstar spokesman Tom Ross echoed similar comments
regarding Mr. Schwartz, noting that the executive's track record is
"very, very good."  In addition to his duties as Chairman and CEO
of Loral Space, Mr. Schwartz will become a Director and Vice
Chairman of Lockheed Martin.  Globalstar investors applauded the
news, sending its shares up $6.375 to close at $40.50 on Jan. 8.

     In a deal valued at more than $10 billion, Lockheed Martin
will buy Loral's defense electronics and system integration
businesses for $9.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of assumed
debt.  It also will invest $344 million for a 20% equity position
in Loral Space at an effective price of $7.50 per share.  Lockheed
Martin will pay $38 in cash per share to Loral shareholders through
a tender offer that was scheduled to begin Friday, Jan. 12.  Loral
shareholders also will receive one share of Loral Space for each
share of Loral.  The transaction is expected to close by the end of
February.

     Loral Space will begin business with more than $700 million in
cash and no debt, the companies said.  Lockheed Martin will provide
Loral Space with support in key technologies while remaining a
major maker of military and commercial satellites.  In addition to
the 31% stake in Globalstar, Loral Space will receive Loral's 33%
interest in Space Systems/Loral, a commercial satellite
manufacturer, and its 22% interest in K&F Industries, Inc., an
aircraft brake company.

     Other assets of the new company will include all of Loral's
Globalstar service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico, and
Brazil and Loral's interest in proposed projects involving domestic
and international direct broadcast satellite (DBS) and broadband
data services.  

     Mr. Schwartz said Loral Space will use its Space Systems/Loral
holdings to expand the new company's DBS business.

     Mr. Kaimowitz said Loral Space has a book value of $1.8
billion or $7.80 a share.  After backing out cash, Globalstar
represents 83% of the assets of Loral Space, he noted.  Loral
Space's book value is broken down as follows:

     *    The 31% interest in Globalstar ($650 million),

     *    The 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral ($150 million),

     *    The 22% interest in K&F ($50 million),

     *    2.8% in management fees from Globalstar ($250 million),

     *    $700 million in cash, and

     *    An undetermined value for the service provider
franchises.

     Mr. Schwartz said one reason Lockheed Martin did not acquire
all of Loral was the high price he placed on Loral's 31% interest
in Globalstar.  Seeing value in the creation of a global
communications network of 48 satellites, Mr. Schwartz pointed out
that globally, more than 3.9 billion people lack telephone service,
and 30 million people currently are waiting for a phone.  

     If Globalstar begins service as scheduled in 1998, Mr.
Schwartz predicted that the company would have three million
customers and $2.7 billion in annual revenues by the year 2002.

     Globalstar's current capital structure consists of $300
million of equity from its 11 partners and $200 million of equity
from its initial public offering in February 1995 (TRI, March 3,
1995, p. 13), according to Globalstar's Mr. Ross.  Loral Space is
the largest Globalstar shareholder, followed by public shareholders
as a group and then Qualcomm, Inc., with an 8% stake.  

     Vendor financing adds another $300 million, and a new bank
financing agreement chips in $250 million.  Additional internal
financing--payments from exclusive service providers (the local
telephone companies) in 73 countries--will contribute another $350
million over the next two to three years, Mr. Ross said.

     The $2 billion project still requires $600 million in
additional external financing.  Mr. Schwartz said Globalstar would
try to raise the money in the debt markets or would turn to Loral
Space and Globalstar's other investors for the funds.  

     Globalstar pulled a $400 million high-yield debt offering from
the market in October (TRI, Oct. 13, 1995, p. 12).  Mr. Kaimowitz
said this happened not because of a lack of investor interest, as
widely believed, but because Globalstar could get "debt at a
cheaper price" from the banks.

     He noted that Loral Space's $700 million in cash and no debt
provides "a vast opportunity to finance the Globalstar project in
very creative ways, with less need for traditional financing
methods."

     The Lockheed Martin/Loral deal is subject to U.S. and European
antitrust and other approvals, and it also requires at least
two-thirds of Loral's shares to be tendered.  

     Lockheed Martin Chairman Daniel Tellep and Mr. Schwartz do not
expect antitrust concerns to stymie the transaction, especially
since Loral's space business will remain a separate company.  Mr.
Kaimowitz agreed, noting that the businesses Lockheed Martin is
acquiring from Loral have very little overlap with its existing
operations.  A $10 billion credit agreement for Lockheed Martin is
being led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bank of America, and
Citicorp USA.

Comsat Plan To Merge Service Units Approved

     The FCC's International Bureau has approved Comsat Corp.'s
reorganization merging its Comsat Mobile Communications (CMC) unit
into its Comsat International Communications (CIC) unit (TRI,
August 4, 1995, p. 9).  Comsat Mobile handles Comsat's Inmarsat
signatory functions.  Comsat World Systems, which handles its
Intelsat signatory functions, already was part of CIC.  

     Under the reorganization, the World Systems and Mobile
Communications units will be housed in the same CIC division but
continue as separate units to conduct the separate Intelsat and
Inmarsat businesses, respectively.  

     Each line of business will have its own Vice President and
General Manager, who will report to CIC's President.  CIC also will
continue to hold Comsat International Ventures.

     Financial, legal, and human resources support services for the
Intelsat and Inmarsat units will be combined into CIC as part of
the reorganization.  U.S. signatory functions for both of the
international satellite organizations will be consolidated into a
single office, which will be headed by a Vice
President-international affairs.  

     In an order issued Jan. 16, the bureau said Comsat ensured
that a separate accounting system would guarantee that World
Systems and Mobile Communications ratepayers do not bear any
"nonjurisdictional" costs of the consolidated CIC unit.  

     The bureau found that the reorganization is consistent with
the public interest and the Commission's 1982 policy findings on
Comsat's corporate structure and operations.

     Addressing concerns raised by AT&T Corp., the bureau noted
that World Systems will not offer Intelsat earth station services. 


     AT&T also voiced concerns that ongoing Intelsat and Inmarsat
privatization efforts could lead to conflicts of interest for the
consolidated organization.  

     Comsat believes issues relating to privatization of the two
satellite organizations "clearly overlap" so that the same staff
"should be able to handle these issues, subject to appropriate cost
allocation procedures," the bureau noted.  

     It added that "internal conflicts are a normal part of any
large business enterprise" and stressed that the bureau has the
authority to review "any instance in which violations of Comsat's
statutory responsibilities and Commission policy may be alleged." 


     The bureau also addressed concerns raised by C-band maritime
satellite services provider MTN and separate international
satellite operator PanAmSat Corp.  

     MTN had argued that Comsat's provision of maritime C-band
service violates the Maritime Satellite Act and the FCC's
structural separation requirements.  The bureau said, "We see no
need to withhold action on Comsat's proposed reorganization pending
consideration in separate proceedings of MTN's contention that CMC
should not provide C-band maritime services over non-Inmarsat
facilities on an unseparated basis."

     While PanAmSat did not oppose the reorganization, it asked
that a partial waiver of the structural separation requirements
granted to CMC in 1993 not be granted to CWS for "value-added"
services that could be sold in conjunction with its fixed satellite
services.  PanAmSat also called for a "single comprehensive
proceeding" to consider Comsat's entire enterprise.  

     The bureau said it will consider the request for a
comprehensive review separately.  It noted that approval of
Comsat's reorganization "does not extend the partial waiver granted
to CMC to provide a discrete class of maritime services on an
unseparated basis."

Arianespace Needs More Rockets To Meet Demand

     Arianespace, Inc., is gearing up now to meet the expected
increased demand for launch services in the coming years, a company
spokeswoman said recently.  Arianespace recently unveiled plans to
order additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launch vehicles to meet the
growing demand.  

     It plans to establish its own finance company to help clients
fund satellite launches, the spokeswoman added.  Its insurance
unit, S3R, also will be reactivated to help market the Ariane 5,
the company's more powerful, next-generation rocket.

     Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches will
grow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  The
company plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70
satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans would
involve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. 
In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4
rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.

     The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergo
two technical verification flights in May and September of this
year, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially by
the end of the year if all goes well.  

     Meanwhile, fueling problems on the launch of Malaysia's first
national satellite, MEASAT, forced Arianespace to scrap a Jan. 9
launch date.  The Ariane 4 rocket also was to deploy PanAmSat
Corp.'s PanAmSat 3R satellite.  The new launch date was set for
Jan. 12.

Intelsat Board To Consider Restructuring Plan This Year

     By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have "a
better idea of the future structure" of the international satellite
consortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-international
and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat Corp.  

     Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.
Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions the board
took at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.  

     A special Intelsat "working party" and a "special committee"
of the board are exploring the future structure of the consortium,
he explained.  The working party will meet three times this year--
after each board meeting--to develop general policies based on the
board's decisions.  The special committee then will do the
"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.

     As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers.  

     The board will review the support centers' performance at its
March 1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open any
additional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.  

     Plans for improving customer service also include
restructuring Intelsat's sales and marketing division and
establishing new internal accounting processes, he added.

     The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-A series
satellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-A satellites will
be deployed in February, and the last bird in the series will be
deployed later this year. 

      Work by Lockheed Martin Corp. on the VIII series of
satellites continues, and the board recently approved a "minor
modification" of the contract with Lockheed that "won't affect the
scheduled delivery," he added.

     The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805 satellite
to provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "While the current
design of the Intelsat 805 satellite provides sufficient land mass
coverage over all of Africa, intersystem coordination constraints
may restrict the use of the Intelsat 805 satellite at 33 degrees
East Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained.  

     At the next meeting in Bangalore, India, slated for March
14-19, the board will consider releasing a request for proposals
for two new satellites to replace two older, Intelsat VI satellites
covering the Indian Ocean region, he said.

Canadian Regulator Awards New DTH Satellite Licenses

     The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission has awarded licenses for two new Canadian direct-to-home
(DTH) satellite services and five DTH pay-per-view television
programming services.  

     The commission rejected a request from a consortium of cable
operators led by Shaw Communications, Inc., to operate a DTH
satellite distribution service.  It also rejected a proposal by
Power DirecTV to operate a French-language DTH pay-per-view
service.

     The two DTH satellite service licenses went to ExpressVu and
Power DirecTV.  BCE, Inc., and Tee-Comm Electronics, Inc., each own
33% of ExpressVu.  Canadian Satellite Communications, Inc., owns
19% of ExpressVu, and another 14% is owned by WIC Western
International Communications Ltd.  Power DirecTV is 80% owned by
Power Corp. of Canada and 20% owned by Hughes Aircraft Co. of
Canada.  

     That company, in turn, is owned by General Motors Corp.'s GM
Hughes Electronics Corp., which also owns U.S. satellite
broadcaster DirecTV, Inc.

     Licenses for four English-language DTH pay-per-view
programming services were awarded to providers of the
"Sports/Specials" and "Power DirecTicket" services, which will be
offered nationally, and to regional operators of the "Home Theatre"
and "Viewer's Choice" services serving western and eastern Canada,
respectively.

     A license for a French-language DTH pay-per-view service was
granted to Canal Premiere, allowing national distribution of
programming.

     The CRTC said it rejected the Shaw Communications group's
request to operate the "Homestar" DTH satellite service because it
"had significant concerns as to whether the Homestar proposal could
be implemented as proposed, in light of the uncertainty related to
the availability of authorized U.S. services via the Primestar
satellite."  

     The agency said it rejected Power DirecTV's request to operate
a French-language DTH pay-per-view service "because of the
commission's concern that this service would not meet the
objectives of the Broadcasting Act."

     The commission also outlined requirements for the DTH
licensees' provision of basic service and "fair and equitable
access" for programming services.  "In particular, the Commission's
policy requires DTH satellite distribution undertakings to maintain
a predominance of Canadian programming in the total packages they
make available to subscribers," CRTC said.  It will require DTH
distributors and pay-per-view services to contribute 5% of their
annual gross revenues toward the production of Canadian
programming.  

     CRTC said it will not regulate the DTH licensees' rates,
reasoning that "competition between the two new DTH satellite
services, the cable industry, and other distribution technologies
will create sufficient market pressure to discipline rates charged
to subscribers."

Canada Reverses Order Cutting Long Distance Rates

     Industry Canada (the country's industry ministry) has
overturned, in part, a recent decision by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission requiring
telecom carriers to reduce basic long distance rates.  

     Seven regional telephone companies had asked the government to
reverse the CRTC's decision, which also required them to raise
monthly local rates by $2 (Canadian) on Jan. 1, 1996, and Jan. 1,
1997.  Long distance rates were to be lowered by the same amount. 
The telcos had argued that CRTC's order was an "unwarranted
interference with market forces," the ministry said.  The local
rate increases will go into effect as ordered, it added.

     Industry Minister John Manley said in a statement that the
government took action "to ensure more investment and sustainable
competition in the telecommunications industry. . .The government
believes this decision will help the industry achieve a greater
stability in the marketplace and increase their investment in R&D." 


     Mr. Manley explained that the Canadian industry's rate of
return on equity is about one-third lower than that of U.S.
companies.  As a result, "Canadian companies do not have the same
resources to invest in research and development and for capital
expenditures."

Brazilian Telecom Reform Bill Heads to Legislature

     Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has signed a
draft telecommunications reform bill and presented it to Brazil's
Congress, according to a government official.  The measure would
permit foreign investors to purchase up to 49% ownership stakes in
Brazilian satellites and cellular telephone service providers.  

     If enacted, the legislation could lead to a tripling of
standard telephone lines to 40 million and could increase the
number of cellular phone lines from 800,000 to 17.2 million over
the next eight years, the official said.  The measure also would
address cable TV regulation.

     Over the next three years the Brazilian government wants to
consolidate the nearly two dozen regional phone companies--one for
each Brazilian state--into a "smaller number like five, six, or
seven," the official said.  

     Consolidation could lead to privatization, although ownership
likely would remain in Brazilian hands, the official added.  

     If foreign companies are allowed to invest in Brazil's
telephone companies, the government may require them to develop
research programs to spur technological development in Brazil.

AT&T Opposes 'Full Circuit' Plan of Telecom New Zealand 

     AT&T Corp. has opposed a motion by Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Ameritech Corp. seeking permission from the U.S. District Court in
Washington for Telecom Corp. of New Zealand (TCNZ) to provide the
U.S. "half" of international services between New Zealand and the
U.S.  

     TCNZ, in which Bell Atlantic and Ameritech own 24.82% stakes,
currently is permitted under a 1990 waiver of the AT&T antitrust
consent decree to provide the foreign half of those services.  It
is seeking permission to establish an interconnection point on the
U.S. West Coast to transport international calls originating or
terminating in the U.S.  Then it would hand off calls to U.S.
interexchange carriers (IXCs).

     TCNZ wants to compete with MCI Telecommunications Corp. and
Sprint International, which provide a full circuit between the U.S.
and New Zealand through their affiliates.  

     A full circuit would allow TCNZ "to compete more vigorously in
the market for calls from New Zealand and would allow it to offer
American [IXCs] an additional, low-cost choice for the transport of
outbound international calls," Bell Atlantic and Ameritech said
late last year in their joint motion.

     In its recent response, AT&T told the court that the proposed
waiver modification would enable TCNZ, Bell Atlantic, and Ameritech
"to impose even greater costs on U.S. carriers" and to gain a
competitive advantage "illicitly."  If the Bell companies were
"genuinely concerned about the consumer harms that result from
inflated accounting rates, they would agree to reduce the current
accounting rate on calls between the U.S. and New Zealand," AT&T
said.  

     Granting the motion would allow TCNZ to preserve inflated
accounting rates and permit Bell Atlantic and Ameritech to use
their operating companies' local exchange service monopolies to
hinder competition and harm customers in the U.S.

     In transmitting calls originating in New Zealand over full
circuit "private lines" to the U.S., "TCNZ would avoid its duty to
return to each U.S. IXC a proportionate share of the traffic [the
IXC] sends to TCNZ," AT&T argued.  

     "That, in turn, would exacerbate the settlement deficits of
these U.S. carriers--and increase the surplus of TCNZ--by denying
U.S. carriers the return traffic on which they would earn payments
from TCNZ."  

     AT&T estimated that if the motion were granted, net payments
from U.S. carriers to TCNZ would increase by 75%--even if only 30%
of TCNZ's traffic were carried over full circuits.

Canadian Government Awards Four Nationwide PCS Licenses

     With the third auction of personal communications service
(PCS) licenses getting started in the U.S., Industry Canada has
announced that it awarded four nationwide PCS licenses.  

     Clearnet Communications, Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, and
MicroCell Network, Inc., of Montreal, each were awarded 30
megahertz PCS licenses.  Rogers Cantel Mobile, Inc., and Mobility
Personacom Canada Ltd., were awarded separate 10 MHz licenses.  

     Industry Minister John Manley said the four new licensees will
invest more than $3 billion to develop their PCS systems.  He
estimated that 8,500 new jobs will be created over the next five
years as the PCS market develops.

     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses to
noncellular companies will create a sound industry structure, which
should facilitate the development of enhanced competition and
innovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.
Simmonds.  

     Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobile radio
networks for businesses in major metro areas.  Nextel
Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholders
in Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with its
PCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in two
Canadians is interested in using PCS.

     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is a
start-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.  A group of
Canadian cable TV companies is among the other major investors in
MicroCell.  

     Rogers Cantel, one of two incumbent cellular service providers
in Canada, will use its 10 MHz license to expand its current
service offerings.  And based in Etobicoke, Ontario, Mobility
Personacom is an affiliate of Mobility Canada, the other Canadian
cellular carrier.  

     Mobility Canada is a national corporation whose "member
companies" are the 11 cellular affiliates of the provincial
landline telephone companies.  The four Canadian PCS licensees will
operate their systems on the same frequencies as their counterparts
in the U.S.--between 1.8 gigahertz and 1.9 GHz.

DBS Permits Extended for EchoStar, Directsat, DBSC 

     The FCC's International Bureau has extended the period during
which EchoStar Satellite Corp. and Directsat Corp. may construct,
launch, and operate direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems.  

     In an order signed Dec. 21 by Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris,
the bureau gave EchoStar until Aug. 15, 1996, to begin operating a
DBS satellite at its eastern orbital location.  In a separate
order, the bureau gave Direct Broadcasting Satellite Corp. (DBSC)
until Nov. 30, 1998, to construct a DBS system.

     To date, DBSC has paid 2.9%, or $2 million, of the total
satellite contract price, and it is slated to pay 27.2% of the
contract price on Dec. 29.  DBSC also has moved up the schedule for
delivery of its first and second satellites to July 1997 and July
1998, respectively, from September 1998 and March 1999.  

     "Extending DBSC's permit until 1998 will allow sufficient time
for construction of both of its satellites under its modified
construction contract," the bureau said.  "Because we grant this
extension based in large measure upon DBSC's expedited construction
schedule, we will condition the grant upon DBSC's remaining in
substantial compliance with that schedule."

     The bureau deferred ruling on EchoStar's request for a
four-year extension to begin DBS operations from its western
orbital slot.  The recent partial U.S. government shutdown
prevented the bureau from reviewing that request.  

     A ruling will be made when the bureau has had time "to make a
due diligence determination," it said.  Mr. Harris was among the
few FCC employees permitted to work during the partial shutdown.

     On Dec. 28, 1995, EchoStar successfully launched its
"USABSS-3" satellite--part of its planned DBS system.  The
satellite will be positioned in EchoStar's assigned eastern orbital
location at 119.2 degrees West Longitude, and the company plans to
start transmitting in early 1996, the order notes.  

     The bureau also granted EchoStar authority to use in-orbit,
fixed-satellite service C-band (4-6 gigahertz) frequencies for all
telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) functions on the space
station.  TT&C functions are needed for general orbital maneuvers
and spacecraft control operations.  EchoStar had planned to use
Ku-band frequencies for TT&C functions but sought authority to use
C-band frequencies instead, citing lower costs.

     Directsat--which was merged into EchoStar Satellite's parent
company, EchoStar Communications Corp., in 1995 (TRI, Jan. 20,
1995, p. 11)--is scheduled to operate its system on a "companion
basis" with EchoStar's DBS system, the order states.  With the
extension, Directsat now has until Aug. 15, 1999, to begin
operating its DBS system at both of its orbital locations. 
Directsat plans to launch its first DBS satellite into the 119
degrees W.L. orbital location this summer, the order says.  

     It has asked the bureau for permission to modify its DBS
license application to permit TT&C operations in frequency bands
currently allocated for government use.  

     The bureau said that request is under consideration "pending
completion of coordination with government users of that spectrum."

Ameritech VDT Plans Grow Dimmer; Applications Pulled

     Ameritech Corp. has hammered another nail into the coffin of
its video dial-tone (VDT) plans, formally withdrawing five
applications for Communications Act section 214 authority to offer
commercial VDT service.  

     Ameritech officials said the decision to withdraw the
applications, which were approved a year ago by the FCC's Common
Carrier Bureau was prompted by the agency's delay in adopting final
VDT rules.  

     Commission officials have said they will address VDT issues
after Congress completes action on pending telecommunications
legislation.

     While forging ahead with plans to deploy stand-alone cable TV
systems over the past few months, Ameritech officials have hinted
that they might abandon their VDT plans.  

     Approval of the VDT applications had permitted Ameritech to
offer common carrier video service in parts of Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

     At a recent press briefing in Washington, Richard C.
Notebaert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ameritech, told
TRI that the company might consider resubmitting the section 214
applications if it is satisfied with future FCC actions in the
pending docket 87-266 VDT proceeding.  He said Ameritech was
bullish about VDT until the FCC began exploring the idea of
regulating telco providers of video services using a hybrid
regulatory structure drawn from both Title VI (cable TV) and Title
II (common carrier) of the Act.

U.S. Regulatory Scene:
Sprint Sets Alliance Vote After Receiving FCC OK

     Sprint Corp. has postponed a shareholder vote on measures
related to the proposed Phoenix global alliance but said it expects
to close the transaction--including an investment of more than $4
billion  by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG--by the end of
this month.  

     A meeting for shareholders to approve the investment agreement
and related charter and bylaws changes technically was scheduled to
begin Friday, Jan. 12.  Then it will adjourn temporarily until Jan.
29, when the Phoenix deal will be considered, a Sprint spokesman
explained.  The "adjournment" will not change the Nov. 13, 1995,
record date for shareholders to be eligible to vote at the meeting,
the spokesman noted.

     The postponement stemmed from long lead-time scheduling of the
proxy distribution and the meeting, which were linked to expected
FCC action to approve the deal, the spokesman said.  When the FCC
acted a week later than had been expected, "some things were pushed
back" in closing procedures, he said.  

     Sprint said the price France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom will
pay for new class A Sprint stock will be $48.704 per share.  That
was the maximum price possible under a formula pegged to the
closing price of Sprint common stock during a 20-day trading period
ending 15 trading days before closing of the transaction.

     During its regular meeting Dec. 15, the FCC granted Sprint's
request for a declaratory ruling that the combined 20% investment
by the European carriers would not conflict with Communications Act
section 310(b)(4) restrictions on foreign ownership of common
carrier radio licensees.  

     Presenting the recommendations to the Commissioners, staffer
Kerry E. Murray said the bureau found that France Telecom's and
Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of 20% of Sprint for as much as $4.2
billion would not constitute a transfer of control of Sprint.  

     The bureau found that the transaction would be in the public
interest, subject to several conditions described by Ms. Murray and
International Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris as "strict."

     Ms. Murray said the bureau found that France and Germany do
not offer "effective competitive opportunities" under the
Commission's recently adopted standard for analyzing foreign
companies' requests to enter U.S. telecom markets (TRI, Dec. 8,
1995, p. 1).  

     But she cited "two important countervailing public interest
factors" for approving the proposed venture.  "Both France and
Germany have begun to implement wide-ranging liberalization plans,
including the introduction of full telecommunications competition
on Jan. 1, 1998," she noted.  The investment by France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom "will enable Sprint to become a more potent
competitor in a wide range of U.S. markets," she added.

     Mr. Harris stated more than once the bureau's conclusion that
the Phoenix alliance will give both Sprint and its French and
German partners short-term competitive advantages in the U.S.,
French, and German markets that will not be available to other U.S.
international carriers.  

     But the conditions imposed by the Commission would mediate
that advantage over the near term and eliminate it by the time the
European Union implements full telecom liberalization on Jan. 1,
1998, he said.

     As explained by Ms. Murray, the conditions are required to
"address the potential for France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to
engage in anticompetitive conduct and the possibility that the
telecommunications liberalization anticipated in France and Germany
may not be fully implemented on schedule."  She said the bureau
recommended making a public interest finding favoring the Sprint
venture under the following conditions:

     (1) Sprint is regulated as a dominant carrier on the French
and German routes;

     (2) Sprint is not allowed "to increase the number of circuits
it operates on the French and German routes until these countries
allow the use of alternative infrastructure [i.e., private networks
operated by utility companies, railroads, etc.] to provide already
liberalized services, and France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom make
available basic switched voice resale";

     (3) Sprint complies with specified nondiscrimination and
reporting requirements;

     (4) "France Telecom commits to lowering its accounting rate
with the U.S. to that of the United Kingdom and Germany within two
years"; and

     (5)"Sprint reports to this Commission in 1998 whether the
anticipated liberalization occurred in France and Germany.  If it
has not, the Commission will take further action, including
designating for hearing whether certain of Sprint's facilities
authorizations should be revoked."

     Asked about the circuit activation restriction, Mr. Harris
explained to Chairman Reed E. Hundt that beginning with the close
of the joint venture transaction, "all three [carriers] can offer
things to large customers that, in essence, nobody else can."  

     He cited single-party billing, billing in a single currency,
and one-stop problem resolution.  The bureau staff believes that
constitutes an "unfair competitive advantage," he said.  

     The circuit activation restriction, therefore, was imposed as
an inducement for the French and German carriers to allow other
U.S. carriers to provide resale services in their home markets.  

     Mr. Harris said French and German government authorities "have
said it's OK" if the carriers agree to permit resale.  Implementing
that policy would enable other U.S. carriers to develop business
relationships with end-user customers before the widespread EU
liberalization in 1998, he added.  

     Similarly, the restriction should provide an incentive for
France and Germany to stick to the July 1996 timetable agreed to in
negotiations with Mr. van Miert to permit competitive carriers to
access alternative infrastructure networks and to roll out services
that already are liberalized in the French and German markets, Mr.
Harris said.  

     That will enable other U.S. carriers to use networks other
than those of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, and thus avoid
benefitting their competitors in those markets.  "The alternative
would have been simply to walk away from the problem for two years,
and two years is a very long time," he added.

     A DT spokesman told TRI after the Commission meeting that the
requirement that DT open the German market to switched voice resale
could be problematic.  "The question is whether they mean simple
'rebilling' or genuine resale," he noted.  

     He explained that although resale of services to "closed user
groups" such as corporate private networks is permitted in Germany,
"if it's real resale outside of corporate users, it's still a
reserved monopoly service until 1998."   The resale requirement was
one of several outlined by the FCC that may not "reflect the actual
situation in Germany," he said.

     Briefing reporters, Mr. Harris said the inducement for France
and Germany to stick to their alternative infrastructure
liberalization deadline of July 1996--and for the French and German
carriers to enter into agreements with other U.S. carriers to
provide public voice resale--will be the circuit activation
restriction on Sprint.  

     He clarified that the restriction will not apply to Sprint's
acquisition of new circuits but rather to its activation and
operation of new circuits on the French and German routes.

     Asked how the restrictions differ from anticompetitive
safeguards sought by the Justice Department in a proposed antitrust
consent decree to allow the Phoenix venture to go forward (TRI,
July 21, 1995, p. 1), Mr. Harris said, "The two overlap at the
edges," differing largely because the responsibilities of DoJ and
the Commission are different.  While Justice oversees antitrust
law, the Commission's statutory mandate to make public interest
findings enables it to "push for additional conditions" to ensure
greater competition, Mr. Harris said.  

     Both the FCC decision and the consent decree require that
Sprint obtain no special concessions and receive nondiscriminatory
treatment vis-a-vis other U.S. international carriers, he said.  

     But the circuit activation restriction, the imposition of
dominant carrier regulation, and the requirement that the Phoenix
alliance meet the Commission's new "effective competitive
opportunities" test for foreign market entry are unique to the FCC
decision, he explained.

     In an introductory statement at the meeting, Mr. Harris noted
that "several weeks ago, this Commission adopted new rules
governing the entry of foreign carriers into the U.S. market.  

     "We said then that the new rules would both open our market to
more competition and create powerful incentives to open foreign
markets to competition. . .This is the first opportunity we have to
apply those rules, and it may be the most important such
opportunity we have for a long time to come."  

     He said the strict conditions proposed for an order approving
Phoenix constituted a recognition that "France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom are still monopolists operating in closed markets."

     Asked by Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett whether there is a
risk that the FCC may have to back-pedal on the decision if France
and Germany do not stick to their liberalization timetables, Mr.
Harris responded, "We do not offer you certainty, but this is our
best judgment of where we think these things are going."  

     If the French and German market-opening commitments are not
met, the FCC might decide in 1998 to "pull" Sprint's Communications
Act section 214 facilities authorizations on the French and German
routes, he said.  

     That would adversely affect Sprint, but the test before the
FCC is the impact  on "the U.S. public, consumers, and industry--
not just one corporation," Mr. Harris said.  "Keep in mind that
Sprint is getting $4 billion and is entering a relationship with
two monopolists.    The key to approving this transaction today is
that those monopolists today will not be monopolists for all time,"
he said.

U.S. Regulatory Scene:
PanAmSat Seeks Satellite Licensing Policy Changes

     PanAmSat Corp. has urged the FCC to prevent the "hardening of
the competitive arteries" in the domestic fixed C- and Ku-band
satellite industry by limiting the number of orbital resources a
single company may control.  

     That would "reinvigorate" the Commission's policy of allowing
competitive entry into the domestic fixed satellite market,
PanAmSat said.  It outlined its proposal in comments it planned to
file once the FCC reopened after the heavy snowfall that struck
Washington recently. 

     Specifically, PanAmSat proposed three steps the FCC should
take "to correct the imbalance in competitive opportunities between
existing operators and new entrants" in the domestic satellite
industry.  It suggested the following:

     (1)  Limiting to five the number of domestic arc orbital
locations that any one entity or its affiliates may control; 

     (2)  Making the domestic-system financial qualifications
consistent with those currently in place for separate international
satellite systems; and 

     (3)  Imposing strict requirements, at both the beginning and
end of a satellite's life, to prevent the "warehousing" of orbital
locations.

     PanAmSat said the domestic satellite industry is dominated by
three major players:  Hughes Communications, Inc., GE American
Communications, and AT&T Corp.  

     Those players collectively control about 23 of the 31 domestic
orbital arcs, it told the FCC.  As a result, it added, there is a
"severe shortage" of domestic C- and Ku-band capacity, which in
turn has led to "sharply increased rates" for capacity.  

     PanAmSat asserted that the FCC's own satellite replacement,
system expansion, and financial qualification policies have
"exacerbated" the scarcity of domestic arc resources.

     The FCC's satellite replacement policy generally allows
companies to launch a replacement satellite into the same location
as a previous one, PanAmSat noted.  

     Operators also are permitted to expand existing satellite
systems by acquiring additional orbital slots.  

     "The replacement and expansion policies, in tandem. . .have
allowed existing operators to lock up the vast majority of domestic
arc orbital positions, and in turn, block the competitive entries
of newcomers," PanAmSat said.  

     "The replacement policy effectively has given incumbents
squatter's rights to their long-held orbital positions, [making] it
virtually impossible to dislodge existing operators from the
locations already under their control."

     PanAmSat called the FCC's domestic "financial showing"
standard--which requires operators to produce a current balance
sheet showing sufficient assets to sustain a multimillion-dollar
project--an "insurmountable barrier to entry to smaller companies." 


     Application of the two-step separate international satellite
system financial qualification standard will "encourage the
development of a vibrant separate satellite system industry without
burdening the Commission with laggards or speculators," the company
maintained.

     Noting that the FCC had imposed limits on direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) orbital slots, PanAmSat said similar limits should
be imposed on the number of domestic orbital arcs controlled by one
entity.  

     Setting a limit of five slots would "strike the proper balance
between preserving the Commission's long-standing competitive entry
policies and rewarding existing operators for the substantial
financial risks and significant investments associated with the
establishment and operation of existing satellite networks," it
told the FCC.

     To prevent warehousing of orbital slots, PanAmSat suggested
that the Commission require all satellite applicants to meet "clear
construction and operational milestones."  

     Construction permits for satellites should be awarded on a
conditional basis, subject to cancellation if entities do not meet
such milestones, it said.  A permittee would become a licensee only
if it successfully followed its prescribed timetable.  

     Also, when a satellite nears the end of its useful life, the
Commission should examine whether the traffic it is carrying could
be consolidated with traffic carried by other satellites owned by
the same operator, PanAmSat said.

Telecom Ministry Hints At Delay on Fate of NTT 

     TOKYO--The new head of Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications Ichiro Hino has said in interviews following his
appointment that a final decision on the issue of a Nippon
Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) breakup may be postponed.  

     Mr. Hino expressed concern that rushing to a decision on an
issue of such strategic importance without a national consensus
would not be the right approach.  Industry sources interpreted Mr.
Hino's comments as a move by the ruling coalition members, Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party and Socialist Party, to offset efforts by
ministry bureaucrats to force a decision within this fiscal year. 


     The end result may be that the politicians gain the upper hand
and delay significant revisions to Japan's telecommunications
industry as they did five years ago when the NTT breakup issue was
first broached and then shelved until 1995.

NTT To Seek 20% Cuts In Long Distance Rates

     TOKYO--Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) President
Masashi Kojima has announced that the company plans to ask the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for permission to reduce
long distance call rates.  The cuts would apply to calls over
distances of 160 kilometers by 30 to 40 yen, a cut of almost 20%. 


     At the same time, Mr. Kojima repeated the company's strong
resistance to efforts by the ministry and NTT's new common carrier
competitors to break up the telecom giant.  

     He pointed to the results of NTT's open network policy as an
indication that there is no need to dismantle a nationwide
infrastructure built up over the past century.

     Specifically, he highlighted the scheduled connection of Tokyo
Telecommunications Network (TTNet)--NTT's local loop rival in the
Tokyo metropolitan area--to NTT's subscriber network this month and
the agreements expected to be reached with cable TV telephony
providers in February for similar network connections.

     Mr. Kojima also stressed the benefits of concentrating
research and development efforts in a single organization.

Japan Telecom Survey:
Personal Handyphone Use Expected To Lag Forecasts 

     TOKYO--Despite recruiting almost 620,000 subscribers in the
first six months after starting service, Japan's personal
handyphone service (PHS) providers are playing catch-up with their
initial subscriber forecasts.  

     Expectations of hitting the 2-million subscriber mark by the
end of fiscal year 1995 in March 1996 likely will be dashed. 
Observers believe the actual figure could be as little as half that
number. 

     At the current pace of 130,000 new subscribers a month, PHS
providers will just top the 1 million level within the fiscal 1995
time frame.  The below forecast results can be attributed to quick
steps taken by conventional cellular phone competitors to bring
their prices down in order to keep customers away from the cheaper,
newer PHS service.  

     In the past year, cellular providers have reduced initial
sign-up fees and usage rates significantly.  They also switched to
a system of open sale of handheld phone units, rather than leasing
them in a bundled package with cellular service.

     One trend is apparent in the PHS market--Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp.'s (NTT's) grip on the telecommunications market is
weakening.  

     In December 1995 NTT Personal Communications Network companies
signed up just 30,600 new subscribers, compared with 52,400 for the
competing DDI Pocket Phone group companies and 51,300 for the Astel
group companies.

     The NTT Personal group hopes to stem this slide in market
share by slashing its rates.  In a recent application to the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the group indicated that
it will cut the usage rate for calls in the 20- to 30-kilometer
range from 100 yen to 50 yen.  For calls in the 30- to 60-kilometer
range, it proposed to cut the rate from 140 yen to 60 yen.  

     In both categories, the adjustments would make NTT Personal's
rates comparable or as much as 25% lower than its rivals.  While
the DDI Corp.'s Pocket and Astel groups are expected to respond
with their own rate cuts, continuing capital requirements for
network expansion could delay their response. 

     The DDI Pocket group, however, has developed a PHS base
station with its partner companies Kyocera, Kyushu Matsushita
Electric, and Nittsuko that will reduce its investment costs by
one-third its per-station costs.  

     The cost-effective base station should reduce DDI Pocket's
per-station cost and enable it to speed up its network expansion.

France Telecom Chairman Outlines Reorganization Plan 

     France Telecom Chairman Michel Bon recently disclosed a plan
to reorganize the state-owned telecommunications giant around five
branches and outlined a strategy to prepare for competition in the
European telecom market beginning in 1998.  

     Speaking at a company meeting in Paris Dec. 20, Mr. Bon said
the plan emphasizes the need to improve customer services and
increase demand for France Telecom's offerings.  It was devised
after Mr. Bon spent three months in the field, talking with more
than 1,000 employees to understand France Telecom's operations
better. 

     French consumers use their telephone lines an average of eight
minutes per day, while U.S. consumers spend about 20 minutes daily
on the telephone, Mr. Bon pointed out.  He said France Telecom must
increase its 3% annual growth rate to a level approaching AT&T
Corp.'s 9% growth rate.  At that growth level, France Telecom's
traffic would increase from 120 billion minutes annually to 170
billion minutes by the year 2000.  "This objective is realistic and
attainable," Mr. Bon said.  

     The additional traffic is expected to come from increases in
mobile telephony use, "improving the flow and efficiency of
traffic," and "encouraging new uses for telephones," such as
personal computer applications, he explained.

     The plan envisions reorganizing France Telecom around three
operational branches and two functional branches.  The operational
areas would include consumer services, corporate services, and
network services, and the functional branches would include
"development" and "resources."  

     An executive committee will be formed, composed of the
President of France Telecom and the company's five Branch
Directors.  The panel's purpose is "to synthesize and coordinate"
France Telecom's operations, with decisions being made "as close as
possible to the field within each branch," Mr. Bon said.  A
"detailed implementation plan" for the reorganization will be
announced "in the next few weeks," he added.

Ericsson, Ascom Joint Venture Clears EC Competition Hurdle

     The European Competition Commission has decided not to oppose
a wireless communications joint venture between Ericsson, Inc., of
Sweden and Ascom of Switzerland.  

     The companies proposed in late November to establish the
venture through Ascom's Swedish subsidiary, Ascom Tateco.  The
venture will develop, manufacture, and install on-site paging
systems and equipment in markets where both parent companies have
been active, the commission noted.

     The commission's review of the on-site paging market found
that the joint venture will be faced with "sufficient competition.
 . .from the present players, which are either strong multinational
companies such as Philips [Electronics NV], Bosch [GmbH], and
Motorola, [Inc.] or are companies specialized in on-site paging,
such as Multitone."  

     The commission said the market is composed of "large
sophisticated customers. . .who are in a position to exercise
significant bargaining power and who frequently use calls for
tenders to award contracts."

EU Telecom Survey:
Mobile Services Directive Formally Approved by EC 

     The European Commission has formally adopted the Article 90
directive (TRI, July 7, 1995, p. 6), opening European Union mobile
and personal communications markets to full competition.  It is
based on comments to a "green paper" on mobile and personal
communications issued in 1994 (TRI, May 13, 1994, p. 1).  

     The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive
and special rights for mobile communications.  It establishes "open
and fair licensing procedures" to authorize the launch of digital
services GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), DCS 1800
(the two frequencies available for digital mobile services), and
DECT (for digital cordless telephony within a fixed radius).  

     The directive requires states to lift restrictions on current
licensees for one of these frequencies from applying to extend
their services into the others.  It prohibits member states of the
European Union from restricting the combination of mobile
technologies or systems, specifically where multistandard equipment
is available.

     Existing restrictions on the use of mobile network facilities
will be lifted, the EC said, "allowing new mobile operators to make
full use of their own infrastructure as well as that provided by
third parties such as utilities' networks."

     The EC said the directive will become effective 20 days after
publication in the Official Journal of the EC, which is expected by
the end of January.  

     Member states then have nine months to notify the commission
of the appropriate national measures taken to implement the
directive's provisions.  

     Under Article 90, the commission can adopt directives under
its own authority without submitting them for approval by the
ministers and Parliament.

EU Telecom Survey:
EC Expected To Approve Atlas, Phoenix Ventures

     BRUSSELS--The European Commission has said it will approve the
Atlas alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG and
their Phoenix global services alliance with Sprint Corp.  

     While stating its intent to approve the two ventures, the
commission is seeking comments on the deals by the end of January. 


     It recently released details of the two deals and outlined
certain changes made following its intervention. 

     One change for the Phoenix alliance requires Deutsche Telekom,
France Telecom, Atlas, and Sprint to delete France Telecom's and
Deutsche Telekom's international half-circuits from the list of
products that Phoenix would distribute as an agent.  

     The companies also are prohibited from either competing with
or investing in long distance service providers unless they are
controlled by Phoenix.  The commission prohibited Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom from discriminating in favor of the Phoenix
entities.  

     For the Atlas venture, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom
have agreed to the following changes:  not to appoint Atlas SA as
an agent for international half-circuits; not to integrate French
and German data networks before full liberalization of the
telecommunications infrastructure and services market; and not to
integrate France Telecom's German corporate telecom service
provider, Info AG, into Atlas.  They agreed Info AG must be
divested.  

     In addition Atlas will not be granted terms or conditions that
would enable it to offer services its competitors are prevented
from offering, the commission said. 

     France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are prohibited from
engaging in cross-subsidization.  They have agreed to establish and
maintain third-party access to their public switched data networks
in France and Germany.

     While the commission is unlikely to reverse its decision to
grant approval to both ventures, it is expected that a number of
national telecom operators will file complaints with the
Competition Directorate.

EC To Give Greece Money For Telecom Improvements 

     BRUSSELS--The European Commission will provide Greece with
172.743 million ECU (1 ECU = $1.28) from the European Union's
European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund for a
telecommunications program.  

     The program, which will run from 1996 until 2000, will help
Greece develop its telecom infrastructure, harmonize national
legislation with EU legislation, provide vocational training in
advanced services, and digitalize its telecom network.  

     In addition to the EU funding, the Greek telecom sector will
receive a loan of 19.4 million ECU from the European Investment
Bank.  The money will be made available to Panafon SA for the
second phase of the construction of a mobile telephony network.

EU Telecom Survey:
EU 'Information Society' To Proceed Despite Doubts

     Some Europeans want to "stop the clock" before proceeding with
telecommunications sector reforms, but engaging in further debate
over whether Europe should develop a new "information society" is
not an option, a senior European official has said.  

     Steven Micossi, the European Commission Director General for
Industry, said at a recent conference that "all basic decisions
have now been taken by the commission" for the telecom sector.  Mr.
Micossi's remarks were made during the annual European Information
Technologies Conference (EITC) held in Brussels.

     "Some member states need to be convinced that privatization
[in] the industry will be beneficial," he acknowledged.  "At any
rate, by January 1998 there will be a de facto open market for the
telecom industry in Europe, where open competition will be able to
develop," Mr. Micossi added.  

     Organized by the commission's Directorate General for
Industry, the EITC conference explored social and cultural issues
raised by the ongoing evolution of European information
technologies.  The conference also highlighted the European Union's
"Esprit" communications research and development program.

     Speaking to reporters after the conference, Martin Bangemann,
Commissioner for Industrial Affairs, Information, and
Telecommunications Technologies, outlined initiatives the European
Union has begun to ensure that Europe is prepared for the evolving
information society.  

     He said significant progress has been made on the first
initiative--to deregulate EU telecom markets.  He emphasized
commitments by France and Germany to liberate alternative
infrastructure markets by July 1, 1996.

     To accomplish goals for deregulation, legislation must be in
place addressing intellectual property rights, data protection, and
competition, Commissioner Bangemann said.  Outdated laws, based on
older technologies, must be modified.  

     He stated that mergers between companies in different sectors
of the communications industry sometimes may be necessary to
strengthen the telecom sector of the EU's economy.  

     Several pilot projects initiated as a result of the G7
ministerial conference earlier this year will spur the development
of information technologies and will make Europeans aware of some
of the practical applications of those technologies, he said.

     Asked about the need to establish an independent EU telecom
authority, Mr. Bangemann said it would be unwise to put the issue
on the agenda for the EU Inter-Governmental Conference slated for
next year.  The issue is highly sensitive and should be examined
carefully before a proposal is presented to Europe's political
leaders, he said.

     In a speech during the conference, Michael Spindler, President
and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Computer, Inc., compared the
current information technologies revolution to the sixth century
"knowledge explosion which resulted from the definition of the
alphabet and mathematics."  

     The current technology revolution will have dramatic economic
impact, he said, citing projections that the U.S. information
industry will amount to $1 trillion by the year 2000 and $1.5
trillion by 2005.  

     Although computer hardware and software will constitute the
largest markets, communications and content development markets
will be important as well, Mr. Spindler predicted.

TRI Financial Barometer:
Prices for Global Telecom Stocks End Year Up 15.5% 

     Helping to drive the broader indices to record highs, the
global telecom stocks tracked by the TRI Financial Barometer saw
share prices rise on average 15.5% in 1995.  

     The overall market, as indicated by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, jumped 33.45% in 1995, closing at 5117.12.  The S&P 500
beat the DJIA in 1995, climbing 34.11% to close at 615.93.

     Share prices for NYNEX Corp. skyrocketed in 1995, climbing
17.25 points or 46.94% to close at an even $54.  

     NYNEX recently reached an agreement with Colonial Data
Technologies Corp. that calls for Colonial Data to be the exclusive
supplier of enhanced Caller ID adjunct products to NYNEX.

     AT&T Corp. also had a profitable year.  Prices for AT&T shares
rose 14.50 points or 28.86% to close at $64.75.  AT&T's recent
announcement that it would eliminate 40,000 jobs over three years
will result in a $3 billion charge to fourth quarter earnings.

     Cable & Wireless plc of the United Kingdom had a good year. 
Its share price rose 84 points or 22.34% in 1995 to close at 460
pence.  

     The company decided on a marketing change for 1996,
substituting the "federation" label for "group."  It said the
change is being made because of confusion surrounding the
federation label, which was used in an attempt to describe the
company's operations in 50 countries.

     Bucking the global trend of price appreciation, Northern
Telecom Ltd. of Canada's share price slipped 4.50 points or 19.25%
before closing at $18.88 (Canadian).  

     The company aligned with Cabletron Systems, Inc., to develop
and market integrated communications and network products.  

     Northern Telecom also said it is near a final agreement worth
more than $150 million over five years with NYNEX for the
distribution and installation of ISDN (integrated services digital
network) hardware and software.

     The company argued that the FCC has failed to consider steps
to encourage small business participation in the auction.  The
Appeals Court is expected to rule on the request before Jan. 19,
the date specified by the FCC for auction participants to submit
"up-front" payments.

SW BELL GETS APPROVAL OF FIVE-YEAR `TELEKANSAS' REGULATION PLAN

Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. closed out 1989 with another
notch in its belt, as far as state alternative regulatory
plan approvals go.  The Kansas Corporation Commission on Dec.
29 unanimously approved the company's five-year "TeleKansas"
plan (TW, June 12), as modified by a settlement agreement
reached early in November between the telco and commission
staff.  The text of the commission's ruling should be released
by the end of January, according to an agency spokesman.

Earlier, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a
three-year experimental regulatory plan negotiated between
PSC staff, Southwestern Bell, and the Office of Public Counsel
(TW, Oct. 2).

The Texas Public Utility Commission is scheduled to begin
hearings on Southwestern Bell's "Texas First" plan on Jan.
22.  A company spokeswoman said that proceeding is not subject
to a statutory time limit.  She noted that the number of
witnesses scheduled to participate could push the hearings
alone, "in a worst case scenario," into six months.

In the Texas proceeding, PUC staff also has proposed that
Southwestern Bell's revenues be reduced by $392,000,000 (TW,
Nov. 13).  The company's Texas First proposal would reduce
its revenues by $72,000,000 annually (TW, Jan. 16).

Under the alternative regulatory plan approved in Kansas,
basic local rates for business and residential customers will
remain at current levels for five years.  These rates will not
be adjusted, as the company had originally proposed, by a
Consumer Price Index/productivity measurement mechanism.
Over the five-year period, the company will make rate
reductions totaling $110,700,000 for toll, intrastate/interLATA
access charges, Touch-Tone, residential service connection
charges, and other services.

The company also will undertake a network modernization program
with an estimated value of $160,000,000 over five years.
Under the program, Southwestern Bell will upgrade all 131 of
its remaining electromechanical switching offices to digital
capability.  The telco also will be permitted flexible pricing
on certain services, such as billing and collection, directory
services, MicroLink I and II (packet switched), Plexar I and
II (Centrex-like), and custom calling.  Instead of the usual
30 days, Southwestern Bell may file rate changes for these
services subject to commission approval in 20 days.  The
commission still could act within the 20-day limit to suspend
rates for the full 240-day period, according to the approved
plan.

The commission also ruled that while the plan is in place,
neither Southwestern Bell nor commission staff will seek to
alter the rates or earnings of the company.  During this
period, other alternative regulatory plans will be explored
and evaluated, it said, noting that it is "not the intention"
to "return to rate base regulation at the end of the five
years."

In the first year of the plan, a $2,000,000 cut in access
charges and a $17,100,000 reduction in intraLATA toll rates
would take effect.  A "1+ Saver" discount plan for  large
businesses would be introduced in the plan's third year.
While Touch-Tone rates would be reduced by 25 cents in the
first year and basic "911" service would be offered free, the
TeleKansas plan also includes rate increases for directory
assistance and rotary hunt services.  Throughout the duration
of the plan, Southwestern Bell will fund dual-party relay
service, offsets for losses on Southwestern Bell toll routes
relating to Optional Community Calling Plans, and an assistance
plan for local service rates.  Residential service connections
charges will drop from $44.15 to $39, and to $36 if the move
is within the same service area.

PACIFIC TELESIS PLANS TO CUT 11,000 JOBS IN FIVE-YEAR EARLY
RETIREMENT, ATTRITION PLAN

Pacific Telesis Group last week announced plans to trim its
management and non-management employee ranks by 11,000 during
the next five years through "early retirement offerings, out-
placement programs, and attrition."  Pacific Telesis currently
employs fewer than 69,000 persons.  Of that number, 64,000
work for Pacific Bell, the group's main operations affiliate.

Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, Pacific
Bell's work force has been reduced by 21% or about 17,000
employees, the company said.  Together with increased operating
efficiencies and growth in the California market, the
downsizing has led to telephone rate reductions of more than
$1 billion since the Bell System breakup, Pacific Telesis said.

Pacific Telesis Chairman Sam Ginn said the force reductions
will occur primarily in Pacific Bell, where about 7600 non-
salaried and 3400 management positions are to be eliminated.
Another 50 positions among the holding company staff will be
cut.  Mr. Ginn noted that Nevada Bell, the group's smaller
telco operating company, recently completed an early retirement
offering that trimmed management ranks by 33%.  Pacific Telesis
said it expects the downsizing to reduce labor costs
substantially over five years and does not expect the costs
of implementing the force reductions to affect net income
significantly.

The company said its early retirement plan will be a permanent
change to existing pension plans for eligible employees in
selected organizations.  Credit for an additional three years'
service with the company and three years of age will be offered
in "selected organizations" within Pacific Bell and the holding
company staff.  The company said employees would be given
details of the offering within a week of the Jan. 4
announcement.  In addition, Pacific Bell managers whose jobs
are identified as surplus but who are not eligible for the
early retirement offering will be given the option of accepting
retraining for other positions within the corporation,
accepting downgrades to other positions, or accepting an "exit
package," Pacific Telesis said.

It said the elimination of 50 jobs at the holding company
level is expected to be completed this year.  The downsizing
effort will include the early retirement offer, retraining,
downgrades, and an out-placement package for eligible
employees.  Surplus holding company-level employees will be
given full consideration for job openings in subsidiaries,
the company added.  The force reduction program will not affect
the group's diversified companies, which include PacTel
Cellular, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel
Business Systems, and PacTel Properties.

MARKEY URGES CONSUMERS TO GET INVOLVED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
POLICY LEGISLATIVE EFFORT

House telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Edward J. Markey
(D., Mass.) is preparing to act on telecommunications policy,
he has told consumer representatives after meeting with a
diverse group for and against Bell operating company relief
from limitations of the AT&T antitrust consent decree.  He
wrote Dec. 18 to representatives of a dozen organizations
attending a Dec. 12 morning meeting to thank them for
participating and to urge consumer input in the policy effort.
Although he mentioned introducing legislation, the first step
later this month is expected to be circulation of a bill draft
for comments.  The consumer meeting was part of a series of
meetings with varied interest groups as the subcommittee writes
a bill.

"As I mentioned last week," he wrote to consumers, "I intend
to introduce legislation when Congress reconvenes.  I hope I
can count on your support of the process and the consumer
provisions we will be promoting.  I urge your active
participation in this debate."  Concerned about issues being
framed only by industry perspectives, he said, "I cannot stress
enough the importance of your role in promoting the need for
consumer safeguards amongst your membership and their
representatives in Congress.  I believe this is a great
opportunity for the consumer to reap the optimum benefits from
the innovations now occurring in telecommunications
technology."

The letter went to officers of the Consumer Federation of
America, the National Association of State Utility Consumer
Advocates, the American Association of Retired Persons, the
National Consumers League, Consumers Union, Public Citizen,
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Alliance for
Public Technology, the United Church of Christ, the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, the Intelligent
Network Task Force, and the World Institute on Disability,
the last two of whom participated in the meeting by telephone
conference call.

FEDERAL-STATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY SUMMIT SLATED FOR
TWO DAYS IN APRIL

The federal-state regulatory summit on telecommunications,
promised by FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes at the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' November
convention (TW, Nov. 20), has been scheduled for April 25-26
in Airlie, Va.  An FCC news release reported that "invitations
have been issued to all chairs of state regulatory commissions"
and said that the meeting "is intended to permit federal and
state telecommunications regulators to explore shared goals
and objectives."  The summit is being co-sponsored by the FCC
and The Annenberg Washington Program of Northwestern
University.  Also expected to attend are representatives of
the National Governors Association.

At the recent NARUC convention, Mr. Sikes had looked forward
to "rekindling a meaningful federal-state dialogue."  He called
for "mutual trust and understanding" in federal-state
discussions, and he asked for a state commitment to developing
"sound, lasting relationships that will lead to achievement
of the goals that are best for the nation."  The FCC Chairman
favored what he called "cooperative federalism," and he warned
that "if we fail to achieve regulatory equilibrium," more
oversight of the telecommunications industry may shift to the
courts.

U S WEST AWARDED EIGHTH BRITISH CABLE TV FRANCHISE;
CONSTRUCTION PLANNED FOR MARCH

Continuing its pursuit of foreign cable television properties,
U S West has acquired an interest in its eighth British cable
franchise.  Last week, Comment Cablevision, a company owned
by U S West and New Jersey-based US Cable Corp., was awarded
the Tyneside franchise, which includes 340,000 homes and 13,000
businesses.  U S West's seven other British cable franchises-
-Birmingham, Camden, Croydon, Haringey, Kingston/Richmond,
Merton/Sutton, and Windsor--include approximately 1,500,000
households, the company said.  It also has cable TV interests
in Hong Kong (TW, Aug. 7) and France (TW, May 9, 1988).


The third-largest cable franchise ever awarded by the United
Kingdom Cable Authority, Tyneside includes Gateshead,
Newcastle, Ponteland, and North and South Tyneside, U S West
said.  It noted that construction is slated to begin in March,
with completion expected in 1994.  The estimated construction
cost is $160,000,000, it said.  Noting that British cable
franchises carry telecommunications licenses, U S West
anticipated that "Comment Cablevision will offer telephone,
facsimile, and data services along with cable television."

AFTER SPECIAL MEETING, NARUC UNIT TO CIRCULATE COMPENDIUM OF
VIEWPOINTS ON MFJ RELIEF

Members of the Communications Committee of the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners spent from
Jan. 2-5 sequestered at the Asilomar Conference Center in
Pacific Grove, Calif., hearing a variety of industry views on
Bell operating company modified final judgment relief issues.
The 15 commissioners present--or three-fourths of the
committee's members--agreed to develop a compendium of industry
positions on the three core decree restrictions.

To be circulated to all committee members, the compendium
would not only state an industry player's position on the
subject but also the players' motives for taking such a
position.  The group also discussed conducting a survey of
all NARUC members on their views about lifting the AT&T
antitrust consent decree restrictions.  The committee had
decided at its meetings last summer (TW, July 31) to hold an
educational, closed-door session similar to one conducted in
l986 at Dartmouth College.  At the Dartmouth gathering, state
regulators had studied BOC line-of-business relief and public
network advancement issues before developing a consensus for
use in the first triennial review of the consent decree's
restrictions.

The purpose of the "son of Dartmouth" California gathering
was to revisit the committee's MFJ resolutions, particularly
in light of legislation pending before Congress to lift BOC
business prohibitions.  Commissioners devoted most of the last
two days of the conference to discussing MFJ relief position
options.  Development of a specific resolution on a group
consensus would be left for the NARUC winter meetings scheduled
for the last week of February.  Observers noted that from
commissioners' discussions, it was hard to pin down whether a
consensus existed on modifying any of the decree restrictions.
Although some commissioners reportedly wondered aloud what
the harm would be in lifting the information services bar,
for example, any consensus on this specific issue was unclear
following the discussions.

ONA CONFERENCE MEMBERS FROM AMERITECH REGION SUGGEST TRIALS OF
TARIFFING APPROACHES

Ameritech region state members of the federal-state joint
conference on open network architecture (ONA) issues have
proposed a means of letting the Bell regional holding
companies' ONA plans be implemented without waiting for
resolution of jurisdictional tariffing issues.  The Dec. 19
memorandum to fellow joint board members, signed by Michigan
Public Service Commission Chairman William E. Long and Ohio
Public Utilities Commissioner Gloria L. Gaylord, noted
consensus among conference members on several major policy
areas.  The only contentious issue, they said, is the degree
to which ONA services should be tariffed at the federal level.

They pointed out that Ameritech region regulators jointly
have filed comments supporting that RHC's "dual tariffing"
approach.  Rather than calling for a delay in ONA
implementation at the federal level until the tariffing issue
is resolved, the two commissioners urged that the agency adopt
one or more regional plans on an experimental basis.

They offered the Ameritech region plan as one of the approaches
that should be tried.  "It is our view that concurrent approval
by the FCC of several plans would serve to launch the ONA
process and, at the same time, permit actual experience with
alternative programs to supplant what seems to be endless
rhetoric and debate on this subject," the regulators said.

They stressed that "the actual experience gained in this area
would allow for a more comprehensive and insightful examination
of potential problems involving the federal tariffing of ONA
services.  Since certain regions appear to have legitimate
concerns regarding this issue, they would have the benefit of
valuable information gleaned from the experience of others
which would enable them to make more fully informed decisions
in this regard.  Indeed, the conservative approach that we
have just outlined seems well calculated to accomplish not
only the commencement of ONA in some regions, but afford others
additional time to study the situation."

In noting areas of accord among conference members, the four-
page memorandum mentioned "unanimous agreement that the cost
allocation procedures outlined in the FCC's part 36
(separations) rules should not produce any significant mismatch
of costs and revenues resulting from the implementation of
ONA at either the state or federal levels."  It also observed
that the conference is "in almost total agreement that maximum
uniformity should be achieved with respect to ONA to the
greatest extent possible."

In addition, the document stated that the conference is "in
general agreement that certain ONA offerings must be filed at
the state level.  Notwithstanding the various (third computer
inquiry court) appeals" (TW, Jan. 17), "intrastate filings of
ONA services should recognize the statutory authority reserved
for the state commissions in determining the terms and
conditions of intrastate BSEs (basic service elements) and
(basic serving arrangements)," they noted.

At the joint conference's last public meeting in November,
New York Public Service Commission Deputy Chairman Gail
Garfield Schwartz had suggested that the FCC could forbear
from requiring the interstate tariffing of BSEs, without
reaching the jurisdictional question (TW, Nov. 20).  State
versus federal tariffing is one of the issues before the FCC
in reconsideration pleas lodged against its order granting
conditional approval of Bell operating companies' initial ONA
plans (TW, Nov. 21, 1988), and in its docket 89-79 proceeding
on access charge changes required for an ONA environment (TW,
April 3).

OREGON ORDERS U S WEST TO CUT REVENUES BY $24,057,000, LET
DIRECTORY ADS SUPPORT COSTS

The Oregon Public Utility Commission has ordered U S West
Communications to reduce its revenues by $24,057,000 this
year, "so that U S West customers will receive benefits from
telephone directory advertising profits."  As a result of the
ruling, U S West Communications' local and toll rates will be
cut by approximately 5% for residential and business customers.

The PUC criticized the company for attempting to withhold
from its Oregon customers the benefits of a telephone directory
publishing agreement with U S West Direct.  Despite the telco's
"representation that the public would benefit from the
publishing agreement and asset transfer (in 1984), U S West
formulated a corporate strategy in 1986 to divert directory
profits from ratepayers to stockholders," the PUC said.

"The company acknowledged that the strategy would cause local
rates to increase, but (it) nevertheless concluded that it
should pursue the goal of flowing as many dollars to the
shareowners as possible, while minimizing the risk of
imputations from regulatory agencies," the PUC noted.  It
stated that information gathered in the investigation of U S
West Communications' rates showed that in 1985, the
contribution from directory advertising was $40.10 annually
per customer.

Specifically, the PUC directed that the telco's Oregon revenue
requirement include approximately $29,000,000 in profits from
directory advertising.  At the same time, the PUC ordered
adjustments in U S West's revenue requirement related to other
issues.  As one of these adjustments, it allowed the telco to
recover in rates approximately $6,500,000 for research and
development supplied by Bell Communications Research.  The
PUC accepted its staff's and the telco's settlement agreement
addressing the company's capital structure and setting its
rate of return on equity at 13.53%.  Its overall rate of return
was set at 11.2%.

The commission began the investigation of U S West's earnings
in December, 1988.  At that time, the PUC staff estimated
that the company was exceeding its authorized rate of return
by approximately $65,000,000.  Staff later modified its
position after further study during the investigation.  At the
beginning of the investigation, the company had indicated
that it was entitled to a rate increase of approximately
$24,000,000.

INVESTIGATION OF SOUTHERN BELL PAY PHONE COMMISSIONS SPREADS
THROUGHOUT ITS TERRITORY

Florida's investigation of Southern Bell Telephone and
Telegraph Co. pay phone commissions to government agencies
has spread to all four states the company serves.  The
Attorneys General of Florida, Georgia, and the two Carolinas
exchanged information last week at a meeting in Atlanta
initiated by Florida's chief lawyer.  None of the
investigations was far enough along to result in legal moves,
and the company was withholding comment.

Meanwhile, in the wake of some settlements affecting jail and
airport phones, the Florida Attorney General is advising
government agencies to hold off settling accounts pending
investigation.  Involved are commissions on calls at coinless
public phones that make up 5% of all Southern Bell pay phones.
The company has traced commission accounting questions to
switching, finding translation problems in central offices.
Its own investigation is still under way.

KANSAS STAFF RECOMMENDS AGAINST AT&T PRICE STABILITY PLAN,
PROPOSES RATE REDUCTION

The staff of the Kansas Corporation Commission has recommended
that AT&T reduce its basic long distance rates by $2,300,000
per year.  At the same time, it advised the commission not to
adopt AT&T's price stability plan (TW, July 24).  AT&T had
proposed that, after a year's freeze, it should be allowed to
change basic long distance rates based on the annual change
in inflation, offset by a 2.5% productivity factor.  After
the second year, AT&T would be able to change rates without
pricing restraints.

Staff did not find the plan to be in the best interest of
customers.  It noted that AT&T currently is allowed to increase
rates by up to 4% or decrease rates by up to 7% without filing
a rate case.  "AT&T's plan does not act to stabilize rates to
any further degree than the previous flexibility granted AT&T,"
it said.  Staff proposed that AT&T be required to file a
traditional rate case for basic rate increases, but it said
that AT&T could be allowed to lower rates on 20 days' notice.
The commission scheduled Jan. 10 and 17 public hearings on
the AT&T and staff proposals.

BELL ATLANTIC TO SERVE AS NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS MANAGER
FOR HARDEE's PAY PHONES

Bell Atlantic Corp. and Hardee's have cooked up a deal whereby
the regional holding company will serve as the fast-food
chain's national telecommunications manager for pay phones.
During a two-year trial, Bell Atlantic will provide account
management and consulting services with respect to public
phones Hardee's will install in its 1100 corporately owned
restaurants across the country.  The agreement, however, does
not cover an additional 2900 Hardee's outlets that are operated
as franchises, Bell Atlantic said.  It added that it will
offer similar "national pay phone consulting and management
services to other large chains such as quick food, convenience
stores, and hotels."  The regional holding company said that
outside of its territory, it will act strictly as a consultant,
"actually bringing business to pay phone providers."

AT&T FILING NEW BROADLY AVAILABLE STATE TARIFF 16 PLAN, AS
BUREAU LETS SOCS TAKE EFFECT

AT&T was expected, possibly as early as TW's Friday news
deadline, to file a new generally available State Calling
Service (SCS) under its controversial tariff no. 16 for
"competitively bid governmental services."  Meanwhile, the
FCC Common Carrier Bureau last week denied "reject or suspend"
petitions filed against AT&T's State Outbound Calling Service
(SOCS).  Originally filed under transmittal no. 1782 for
members of the Michigan Collegiate Telecommunications
Association (TW, Sept. 4), SOCS was expanded under transmittal
no. 1959 to be available to all "institutions of higher
education owned and operated by a state government or to state
and local government agencies" (TW, Dec. 18).

In its Jan. 5 order, the bureau found that the interexchange
carrier competitors opposing the two SOCS transmittals
presented "no compelling argument" that it should reject or
suspend the tariff.  SOCS, thus, was allowed to take effect
on Jan. 6.  The new generally available SCS offering was
mentioned in AT&T's response to those opposing its transmittal
no. 1959 as the reason why AT&T had not projected any
additional demand or revenues to result from the expanded SOCS
availability.  It is expected that state governments and higher
education institutions will find the new SCS offering more
attractive, a company spokesman noted.

DIALING & DEALING

After several deferrals, AT&T's new "location account billing
option" for software defined network (SDN) service (TW, Sept.
11) was allowed to take effect on Jan. 6, more than one month
after AT&T had received the go-ahead to implement other
portions of a package of SDN rate level and structure changes
previously filed at the FCC (TW, Dec. 4).  The option allows
customers "to include on their networks, under separate bills,
location customers which operate with the SDN customer in a
common business . . .and which the SDN customer owns or
franchises" or "provides centralized management, oversight or
coordination."  The option took effect after the Common Carrier
Bureau last week found "no compelling argument" to suspend or
reject the filing.  Earlier last week, AT&T had filed
additional revisions to the proposed option, under transmittal
no. 2004.

-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE AWARDED

TWW-2 January 1996-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE
AWARDED
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

VIENNA, AUSTRIA- The Austrian government has awarded
the first competitive GSM cellular licence to a
consortium backed by Siemens and Deutsche Telekom
known as Oe-Call.  Oe-Call bid US$397m for the
licence -- the highest of the five applicants. 
Viktor Klima, transport minister for the Austrian
government, said that the competing service was
forecast to bring down prices by as much as 30%. Some
competing consortia said that the bid was unfair as
Siemens was an important equipment supplier to the
Austrian Post Office -- operators of the other GSM
service.  An appeal is permitted under Austrian law
although to date no company has said that it intends
to take advantage of this option.

PORN, USERS PROTEST
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

BONN, GERMANY- CompuServe, the giant US online
computer network service, has suspended worldwide
access to over 200 Usenet messaging groups following
concerns raised by German politicians over the
illegal pornographic nature of some contents. Users
throughout the world have criticised the company for
its actions, saying that the claims are unfounded and
that many worthwhile groups have been hit by the
action.  A raid had been made in November at offices
from the German federal prosecutor's office where
files and systems were examined.  Observers say that
the move had dire consequences for other Internet
service providers and point out that CompuServe needs
to engineer a system to restrict country-by-country
access in cases where it is forced to instead of
hitting all users worldwide. CompuServe has been keen
to point out that it did not have any input into the
Usenet groups being suspended over claims that they
contain child pornography and other undesirable
material.

-BRITISH AD WATCHDOG CLAMPS DOWN HEAVILY ON
ADVERTISERS

TWW-2 January 1996-BRITISH AD WATCHDOG CLAMPS DOWN
HEAVILY ON ADVERTISERS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- The Advertising Standards Authority, the
British ad industry watchdog, has clamped down on a
number of firms for their recent breaches of the
advertising code.  PEOPLES PHONE COMPANY PLC has seen
a complaint against it upheld where it offered a free
pocket colour TV on the purchase of a mobile phone. 
The complainant stated that the offer was only valid
for a select number of phones and not the entire
range as implied and noted that the offer was only
being offered for analogue handsets and not the
digital ones.  The company said that the offer
applied to all mobile phones and not all tariffs with
the exclusions listed in footnotes.  The ASA said
that the adverts should have been more clearly stated
to avoid confusion and requested that greater care be
taken in the future.  TOBYWARD LTD, trading as
Private Lines, had a complaint against it upheld
following objections to a mail order advert for
 Computer Hard-core Interactive Intercourse' which
was carried in PC Mart.  The crux of the complaint
centred around the tone of the language in a magazine
often bought by children.  In response Tobyward said
that they were aware of the sensitive nature of the
material, which had been certificated by the British
Board of Film Classification and that they thought
the publication was aimed at 18 to 35 year olds and
tailored the advert accordingly.  The SAA said that
while it had no objection to the adverts it requested
that a different headline be used if the same advert
was to be used in non-adult publications. VIRGIN
INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT had a complaint against a
poster campaign upheld which featured the images of
dictators along with the strap  previous high
scores.' The ASA noted that permission had not been
given by President Chirac of France (who was featured
in the ads) and requested that the campaign not be
re-run.  IPC CORPORATION (UK) LTD had complaints
against it upheld following objections to an advert
which featured Pentium computers with a strap "50%
cashback. Choose any model from the fantastic
Cashback range and you'll be eligible to claim back
an amazing 50% of its purchase price in just five
years time." The advertiser said that the advert
contained two separate offers not applicable to all
products and the ASA said that the rules were not
very clear and requested amendments be made to the
advertisements.  GATEWAY 2000 EUROPE came under fire
after Dell Computer Corp, the Personal Computer
Association and members of the public complained over
adverts claiming that they had the first Windows 95
PCs on sale today and that every Gateway 2000 PC now
features Windows 95. The complaints stated that
Windows 95 was not on sale at the time of the
adverts' appearance and challenged the claims.  The
public complaints also noted the use of VAT exclusive
prices.  Gateway admitted it had acted wrongly,
claiming that the adverts were put together hastily
and the ASA requested that greater care be taken in
the future. Complaints were also upheld against ESCOM
who stated that it had over 160 stores nationwide and
open up to 8pm on Thursday nights when not all of the
stores operated late night opening policies; GAME LTD
was censured after it advertised management positions
with a retailer of multimedia technology with the
headline  Personality isn't everything' featuring a
young woman wearing a mini-dress and a man embracing
her behind the neck; RANK XEROX was censured for
using pictures of Trevor McDonald and Alan Whicker in
adverts for printing and copying machines without
their permission, claiming that such pictorial use
implied their recommendation of the machines;
HUTCHISON ORANGE was censured following a direct mail
shot which offered trade-ins through a dealer which
apparently did not exist when the recipient called
local outlets and ISLRIS RACING SERVICES were
censured for a press advert which failed to give the
correct call rates for a premium rate telephone
number listed.

TWW-2 January 1996-DISPUTE OVER INTERNATIONAL CALL
LIMITATION GOES ON
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- An agreement has still to be reached
between BT, Mercury Communications and telephone
regulator Oftel over the timetable for the removal of
BT's and Mercury's sole rights to operate
international telephony networks out of the UK.  
While national service offerings are a free-for-all,
international service operation is still limited.  
Oftel is keen to open all of the markets, the
telephone companies naturally want to retain as many
advantages as possible and the UK government's
Department of Trade and Industry says that it is
broadly in favour of opening markets but notes that
it is discussing the move with the EU and World Trade
Organisation. Figures for 1994 show that 3.13bn
minutes of outbound telephone calls were made and
3.58bn minutes of incoming calls -- a surplus of 44m.

LONDON, UK- The British government is planning to
invest millions of pounds in backing for a new
Internet project which will allow UK firms to
showcase their activities on the Internet.   The
funding would come out of the government's
 information society initiative' which would provide
support for companies looking at utilising the
Internet and the so-called information superhighway
as a worldwide window.  Backing for the service,
where budgets have yet to be revealed, is being made
by the Federation of Electronics Industry, trade
organisations and firms such as IBM, BT and Fujitsu. 
The planned offering would also include order
matching, overseas business promotion, access to
marketing sources and trade awareness.

-COST OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD THREATEN OPEN POWER
MARKET

TWW-2 January 1996-COST OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD
THREATEN OPEN POWER MARKET
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- Plans by the UK government to open up the
domestic electricity market for competition are under
threat due to delays in the development of a complex
computer system needed to ensure compliance and open
activity.  The government and Coopers & Lybrand, the
retained consultancy, have confirmed that there are
serious doubts over whether a GBP100m computer system
could be operational by 1 April 1998 -- the date set
for domestic competition.  Some government sources
have hinted that matters have also been protracted
because of electricity companies proving to be less
than cooperative with many aspects of the plan.  The
computer system would mirror the electricity pool
used for commercial electricity affairs although it
will need to be larger and more powerful because of
the differing numbers of customers.  One option
facing the government is a phasing in of system
functionality and relative options.   There has also
been a number of rows over just who is to pay for the
computer system.  The government is expected to
announce a number of amendments to the programme in
January.

-COMPLAINTS MADE OVER OFTEL'S BT CLAIMS

TWW-2 January 1996-COMPLAINTS MADE OVER OFTEL'S BT
CLAIMS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- A number of complaints have been lodged
against Don Cruickshank, director general of Oftel --
the British telecommunications regulator -- over
comments he recently made about BT, Telecomworldwire
understands.  In November Cruickshank accused BT at a
public forum of failing to implement fair trading
throughout its business, suggesting that BT took the
view that there was no corporate harm in having anti-
competitive practices unless the regulator
intervened.  Oftel was not available for comment at
the time of going to press over the complaints
apparently lodged against Cruickshank.  Meanwhile
Oftel is to take action and monitor BT's activities
in the Internet service provision market following
some industry concerns that BT would be acting anti-
competitively and stifling fair competition in this
growing sector.   Some Internet service providers
have received a letter from Oftel admitting that BT
is cross-subsidising its services although the
regulator is presently watching the situation,
declining to take any action as the venture is still
effectively as a start-up.  Certainly commercially it
would not be sensible for BT to upset the market too
closely as it is a major supplier of leased lines and
secondary circuits and provision to many Internet
service providers in the UK.

TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- Several cellular service providers are
clamping down on their customers mobile phone usage
in a bid to cut fraud.  One network reseller has
already placed a ceiling of GBP50-worth of calls
without a deposit being paid and large deposits are
being demanded off GSM digital cellular users who
wish to take full advantage of cellular roaming while
overseas. Cellphones Direct, a UK service provider
who resells Vodafone Group airtime, plans to
introduce its cellular ceiling plan in February,
despite customer concern to the plan.  Vodafone and
Cellnet, as network operators, are not responsible
for the charges placed by its reseller agents who
deal direct with members of the public.

LONDON, UK- According to a tribunal arranged by the
UK government's Customs & Excise department, food and
drink ordered by computer screen should be zero-rated
for VAT (value added tax) purposes. Presently all
food ordered is subject to 17.5% VAT. The tribunal
was hearing a case featuring Emphasis which provides
an E-Meal service whereby sandwiches, drinks and
confectionary are ordered by computer for delivery.
The tribunal was told that as the food was ordered it
should be classified as catering and thus be zero-rated.

LONDON, UK- The British government has confirmed that
police are empowered to search and read electronic
mail messages sent by companies and private
individuals.  Michael Howard, home secretary,
confirmed that the 1985 Interception of
Communications act does cover electronic mail and as
such allows authorised interception of e-mail
messages.  UK-based Internet service providers would
be forced to provide assistance to police upon
provision of a properly-executed warrant, however
observers note that there would be problems placing
warrants on systems hosted outside of the UK-- such
as CompuServe.

LONDON, UK- The Metropolitan Police has started the
rollout of its new force-wide trunked radio service
known as Metradio. The service is being rolled out on
a sector-by-sector basis and the Met hopes for all of
 1 Area' to be on the system by the end of February. 
Once the programme of installation is eventually
completed, over 18,000 operational officers will be
using the UHF-based trunked system.  Senior officers
say that the network will provide a number of
benefits to policing including secure communications,
better speech quality, pooling of frequencies,
greater security for officers and a more reliable
service.

TWW-2 January 1996-FEARS GROW OVER UK TELEPHONE
BANKING SERVICE
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- British banking unions are becoming ever
concerned over the growth in telephone banking
services, claiming that new experiments could leave
High Street branches out in the cold. The National
Westminster Bank is trialing a system where customers
calling a local branch are switched to a central
answering centre and routine queries are dealt with
by staff linked to computer systems.  Officials say
that if the scheme is implemented, millions of staff
will be moved over to the cheaper service.  Peter
Haines, a spokesman of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, said: "We are worried that it could be
used as a back-door way of phasing out all local
branches.  NatWest denied that it had plans to phase
out branches, saying that they remain a critical part
of their business plan.

-COMPUTER TAX PLAN BY BRUSSELS COUNCIL

TWW-2 January 1996-COMPUTER TAX PLAN BY BRUSSELS
COUNCIL
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM- In a bid to champion the return of
the typewriter, a city borough council in Brussels is
planning to introduce a tax in the workplace. The
voted measure will see an annual GBP12 levy made on
every computer in central Brussels area and companies
will be forced to display a licence sticker as proof
of payment.  The tax law does not say what provisions
need to be made for laptop computers. Incredibly, a
number of inspectors are being appointed to police
the licensing process.  The city's finance department
used the argument that computers take away jobs and
hence it is acceptable to place a tax on them. Around
GBP1m is expected to be raised by the tax.  A number

TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

PARIS, FRANCE- Six French banks have aligned to
launch a new joint computer project which will
eventually permit inter-bank financial transactions
to be carried out automatically for the first time
instead of by hand. Credit Agricole, Credit
Lyonnaise, Credit Commercial de France, Credit du
Nord, Barclays France and Caisse des Depots have
committed to spending Ffr30m on developing a system
in association with Cap Gemini Sogeti and Altis which
will be operational early in 1997.  At first the
network will be used for transactions valued in
excess of US$5m.  Present-day estimates say that
there are around 20,000 trades valued in excess of
his threshold carried out by hand daily.  Banks will
make a contributory payment for use of the service.

TWW-2 January 1996-JAPAN MOVES FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS
LIBERALISATION
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

TOKYO, JAPAN- Senior Japanese officials have hinted
that the government is planning to introduce a
widescale liberalisation of the country's
telecommunications marketplace.  Issel Inoue,
minister for posts and telecommunications, has said
that in principle barriers between local and long-
distance telecomms operations and between domestic
and international will be removed.  Japan's market is
hindered by a number of different regulations that
prohibit market cross-entry and these are to be
lifted with a new set of fairness regulatory models
inserted in their place to protect smaller companies
from being impacted by larger competitors.  No time
span has been mooted for the new regime, however.

TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- Hutchison Orange, operators of a UK PCN
service, has changed the way they distribute products
to the channel, much to the chagrin of retailers.  A
range of new and existing handsets are now being made
available to dealers at full trade prices with
commission paid upon connection.  When Orange first
launched it sold units at net prices to dealers who
then sold on mark-up. The company claimed that it was
breathing a breath of fresh air into the cellular
marketplace although it denies that it has made a
sudden about turn.   Orange dealers will also be able
to earn extra commission by signing up customers to
higher price plans, based on marketing support
programmes and gimmicky offers.  "Orange if convinced
these proposals will ensure the competitiveness of
the trade proposition for 1996, building on the
excellent results seen since the launch of Orange,"
claimed Gareth Jones, group director of sales.

TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- America Online is making a move into the
UK market. AOL claims to be the largest online
service provider -- although so does with CompuServe
with around 4m customers -- and it believes that it
can make a dent in the UK market despite arriving
many years after CompuServe first pitched camp. AOL
will be bringing exclusive British content for its
online service as well as the usual range of Internet
services and resources.  Pricing has yet to be
determined although it is expected to be comparable
to the US service.  The company is keen to point out
that it is not just marketing its US service with a
few extras into the UK, instead preferring to produce
the best of its US output with great UK and European
content. America Online has seen its move scrutinised
by the European Commission's anti-competitive
officials because of its planned alliance with
Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.

INDIA- UNCERTAINTIES FORCE TELCOS TO SEEK
ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES

Australia's Telstra is among foreign telecommunication companies
which have decided to alter their investment strategy in India
following the debacle over the awarding of licences to run basic
services in 20 regional circles.

On 1 January Telstra, along with significant industry players such as
AT&T and US West, failed to re-submit bids for basic service
licences. Only six consortia submitted bids for licences in five
circles. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had earlier
reopened the tender for 13 licences following the notification of
minimum bids prices (TNA November 30, 1995).

Paul Rea, a Telstra spokesman, told Telenews Asia that although
India remains a priority area for investment, DoT's minimum price of
$US2.5 billion for the Tamil Nadu circle was too much. Also, the
present uncertainties discouraged a resubmission for a basic
services licence. Rea said that "Telstra was not prepared to seek the
licence at any price". So instead Telstra would pursue alternative
investment strategies.

Telstra's alternative strategies include joining other international
carriers, with Indian partners, in managing basic regional
telecommunication services. Rea confirmed that Telstra has been
approached by foreign telcos to join them in partnerships; he was
not prepared to say which companies. Rea did point out, however,
that Telstra has appointed a senior executive, Dr Sanjay Modak, to
head up its New Delhi office. Modak's appointment indicates that
Telstra considers India one of its most important overseas
investment areas, according to Rea.

Other investment strategies open to Telstra include building its
technology transfer relationship with C-Dot and focusing more on
cellular services (see story below).

The uncertainties referred to by Rea include India's largest
opposition party, the Bharatiaya Janata Party, which is widely tipped
to win April general elections, threatening to cancel Congress-
awarded telecommunications licences (TNA December 14, 1995)
and eight separate Supreme Court petitions which seek to
invalidate the DoT's authority to award licences. The petitions relate
to the failure of the Congress government to establish a
telecommunications regulatory body before opening the
telecommunications sector to foreign investment (TNA September
7, 1995).

On 9 January the Court postponed until 16 January a hearing into
the petitions. Until the Court rules on the petitions DoT remains
powerless to award licences to any consortium. DoT had earlier
notified a Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd-led consortium
that it had won four licences and a Hughes-led consortium that it
had won one licence (TNA November 30, 1995).

The six consortia willing to meet the DoT's minimum licence fee
were: Bell Canada/Tata with $US1.2 billion in Andhra Pradesh;
NTT/Goekna with $US3.2 billion in Tamil Nadu; Bell Atlantic/Essar
with $US1.3 billion in Punjab; Nynex/Reliance with $US0.9 billion
in Gujarat; Moscow Telecom/Usha with $US0.7 billion in Bihar. A
Stet/Bharti consortium also submitted a bid for Punjab.

The DoT received no bids for Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, Madhya
Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, eastern Uttar Pradesh, the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the north-east region.

Meanwhile, the BJP-led state government of Maharastra has
cleared the US power company Enron to resume work on the
$US920 million first stage of a power project which represents the
largest ever foreign investment in India. Enron's difficulties with the
nationalist-BJP have been keenly watched by foreign investors in
India as a test case should the BJP win overall government in April.

INDIA - GOVERNMENT SET TO APPROVE PARTNER SWAPPING

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) looks set to approve
a proposal by Modicom Networks Ltd to replace the US' Vanguard
Cellular with Australia's Telstra as equity partner in running cellular
services in Karnataka and Punjab.

The proposal comes after DoT announced on 12 December that it
had awarded 18 licences to run cellular services in regional areas.
The Modi group currently holds 51 percent equity in Modicom, with
Vanguard holding 26 percent and Thailand's Telecom Asia holding
the remaining 23 percent.

If Modicom's proposal is accepted it will likely encourage other
Indian-led consortia to swap foreign partners in equity
arrangements for both cellular and basic service licences. A DoT
source told Telenews Asia that while the DoT had received no other
applications from cellular licencees to change their foreign partners,
there have been informal enquiries.

Koshika Telecom and a Hinduja/HCL consortium are both looking
for new foreign partners to replace Philippino Telecom and
Singapore Telecom. Koshika has cellular licences in Orissa, Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh east and Uttar Pradesh west. Hinduja/HCL has a
Tamil Nadu cellular licence.

Meanwhile, Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) failed
to meet the first instalment for its cellular licence fee for Gujurat. The
$US47 million fee was due on 12 December. HFCL is the subject of
Supreme Court actions over the high licence fees it quoted to run
basic telecommunication services.

Sources in HFCL told Telenews Asia on 5 January that the cellular
licence fees will be paid within a few days. A DoT official told
Telenews Asia that licences would not be revoked as a result of late
payment but a late fee of Rp2 million ($US57,000) per day would be
charged. JT Mobile, Hinduja/HCL, BPL/US West, Hexacom and
Aircell also failed to make their first licence fee instalments on time.

CHINA - ARMY TO BUILD NATIONAL PAGING NETWORK

A commercial unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China
Electronics System Engineering Co (CESEC), is planning a new
nationwide public radio paging network in association with foreign
joint venture partner Hutchison Telecommunications (Hong Kong)
Ltd, according to Canning Fok, group managing director of parent
company Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.

CESEC is also due to launch a public AMPS network in Nanjing
during January, under a separate joint venture arrangement with
Hutchison, according to Fok. Hutchison has already invested in 15
small paging networks in the Nanjing military region.

If CESEC goes ahead with its paging project, it will be up against
tough competition from hundreds of private, regional post and
telecommunications authorities and state sector networks, not least
the Singapore Telecom-backed Beijing Asia Pacific First Star
Communications Technology Co Ltd which plans to inaugurate its
own national paging system in the middle of 1996 - about a year
later than planned.

Hutchison has a 51 percent stake in the company installing the
Nanjing cellular network, which will have initial capacity for 10,000
subscribers. The network will be operated by CESEC in deference
to China's prohibition on foreign direct investment in
telecommunication services. Fok said that he believed the network
would likely be upgraded to CDMA in future and discussions are
already in progress to integrate the Nanjing system into the PLA's
other public cellular networks being installed in China's coastal
provinces (TNA July 27, 1995).

A third joint venture with Hutchison has been formed with CESEC to
develop trunked radio services in China. Fok declined to elaborate
as the projects were still in the early planning stages.

Hutchison is not the first foreign player to consider offering finance
and technical expertise for the PLA's cellular network in Nanjing.
Star Paging and AT&T were among foreign operators previously
courted to build a system there, but successive attempts to launch
services failed because of the reluctance of the local
telecommunications authorities to provide PSTN access.

However a policy shift by the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications in late 1995 enabled CESEC to start offering
public cellular services and these will be extended to 15 cities by
the end of 1996 using its national allocation of 10 MHz of AMPS A
band spectrum, previously reserved for military use, and a
combination of analogue AMPS and TDMA networks.

CHINA - GUANGDONG NEEDS FOREIGNERS FOR BROADBAND
NETWORK

Guangdong province plans to invest $US24 billion within 15 years
to construct a broadband telecommunications network and needs
foreign participation, according to the China Daily.

The newspaper quotes a Guangdong Post and
Telecommunications official, Liu Kejun, as saying that in order to
develop the broadband communications network, foreign investors
are "welcome to participate" in equipment purchase, leasing, and
personnel training.

Liu said that because the central government has not defined
policies on foreign participation in broadband technology there are
likely to be more opportunities available than with basic
telecommunication services. Watching for the huge market potential
of China's telecoms, many foreign companies, therefore, are
making efforts to enter this sector, hoping to participate in network
operations, Liu said.

However, Liu suggested that broadband network operations should
still be controlled by the government's posts and
telecommunications administrations, while broadband business
services could be run by other organisations, including foreign
companies.

Liu also suggested that telecommunications-related laws and
regulations need to be perfected, and that the government should
maintain good coordination between broadband network operators
and service providers. The establishment of an "information
superhighway" is a key to competition among countries in the next
several years, he said.

CHINA - MOTOROLA WINS RIGHT TO PROVIDE CDMA
CELLULAR & FIXED WIRELESS SYSTEMS

Motorola's Cellular Infrastructure Group and Xi'an Datang
Telephone Co have signed a MoU to provide cellular and wireless
local loop (WLL) base station and switching equipment to the China
market.

The MoU includes Motorola's CDMA technology and Datang
Telephone Co's SP30 super switching equipment.

The Minister of Post and Telecommunications, Wu Jichuan, the
vice-governor of Shaanxi Province, Fan Xiaomei, and the executive
vice president and general manager of Motorola, Jack Scanlon,
signed the MoU in Beijing on 22 December.

As part of the arrangement, Motorola will provide technical support
to Datang Telephone Co for the development and certification of
industry standard open interfaces for cellular and WLL applications.
These interfaces ensure the compatibility of switching and radio
sub-systems. The arrangement between Motorola and Datang
focuses on IS-634 for CDMA applications and V5.2 for WLL.

Xi'an Datang Telephone Co is a high technology enterprise
engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sales of
telecommunications products. The SP30 super switching system
was developed by Datang Co.

Motorola will ship more than 1,000 commercial CDMA cell sites
worldwide by year end 1995. Motorola supplied CDMA
infrastructure equipment for the world's first commercial CDMA
network launch in Hong Kong in September 1995.

INDONESIA - FOREIGN COMPANIES READY TO EXPAND
REGIONAL NETWORKS

Indonesia's telephone subscribers, especially those living in remote
areas, can expect to see the beginning of big changes during 1996
as foreign companies take over the expansion of the regional
telecommunications network.

The state carrier, PT Telkom, has begun handing over the
management of five designated regions under the terms of joint
operating contracts (KSOs) signed before the partial float of PT
Telkom in November 1995 (TNA November 2, 1995).

Networks in Sulawesi, Irian Jaya, Maluku and Nusa Tenggara have
reportedly already been handed over while those in Ujangpandang
and South Sulawesi are in transition. Other networks in Sumatra,
West Java, Central Java and Kalimantan are set to change hands
by the middle of January.

The KSOs are the key to a government plan to add five million
telephone lines to the Indonesian telecommunications system by
the end of 1999.

A spokesman for Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, which is to operate the
Sumatra KSO, outlined the company's plans in an interview with
The Jakarta Post saying that it would take over the management of
600,000 existing lines in Sumatra and install a further 516,487.

The spokesman said that 7000 Telkom employees would join
Pramindo which is 59 percent owned by PT Astratel Nusantara, a
subsidiary of the Indonesian Astra International group, 35 percent
owned by France Cable et Radio, a subsidiary of France Telecom,
with a further six percent owned by Primkopparpostel, a cooperative
of the employees of the Ministry of Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications and PT Intertel Pratama Media.

According to the spokesman, Telkom's regional division office in
Medan will become a KSO unit and will maintain the old billing
system for existing subscribers. The company's investment in the
project is estimated to be $US70 million.

He said that the company was still negotiating with potential
partners, among them were Marubeni Corp and Nichimen of Japan,
the International Finance Corp, a World Bank affiliate and the
Commonwealth Development Corp of Britain, although there would
need to be government approval before new names could be
added to the KSO shareholders.

On another front, the government has said that it will drop sanctions
against PT Daya Mitra Malindo if it settles its internal conflicts over
its KSO contract in Kalimantan.

The company had problems sealing the deal with the government
for its KSO project because of a dispute between the partner
companies, one of them being the state-owned PT Telkom.

The executive director of Telekom Malaysia, Said Ali, told the
Indonesian Observor in December that his company was still
negotiating "crucial matters" concerning the term of the cooperation
agreement with PT Mitra Malindo (TNA December 14, 1995).

INDONESIA - HIGH PAGER USE STRETCHES PUBLIC
TELEPHONE NETWORK

The Government has dramatically revised upward its estimate of the
number of pager users in Indonesia and is concerned about the
shortcomings of the nation's public telephone network as a result.

As a way to deal with the problem the Government is considering
handing over to the private sector the management of public
telephones outside Jakarta in the hope that private operators would
install more phones and improve old ones, according to the Minister
of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Joop Ave.

Joop said in a statement that a single company - probably a small
one - would be chosen. He did not mention whether the Jakarta
public telephone network, which is also under heavy strain and
plagued by maintenance problems, would be upgraded.

Joop's statement of his preference for a small operator to take over
the management of the regional phone network follows earlier
pronouncements from the government that small and medium sized
businesses were to be given a break in the allocation of
government contracts (TNA September 7, 1995).

The Department of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications has
already allowed smaller companies to operate as providers of
Internet and pager services.

According to Joop, there has been a big increase in demand for
public telephones because of the large number of Indonesians who
carry and receive messages on pagers but do not have a personal
telephone.

Joop said that the number of national pager operators had
increased from two to eight in two years and that the number of
customers using paging services had reached 500,000. He also
said that 90 new regional pager licences would be issued - none of
them in Jakarta.

Joop said that he had adjusted the government's target for the sixth
Five Year Development Plan period to allow three million pager
customers by 1999 instead of the earlier estimate of one million.

One of the largest pager operators, PT Buana Bintangbayu, which
operates paging services in seven Indonesian cities and has big
expansion plans, is negotiating with Singapore Telecom to provide
international roaming services.

Buana Bintangbayu, a joint venture between PT Telekomindo
Primabahakti and Mitsui Co, has said that it plans to include other
foreign partners in its business, such as companies based in
Malaysia and Thailand.

THAILAND - TARIFF CUTS TO ENCOURAGE BROADER MOBILE
SUBSCRIBER BASE

Reductions in mobile telephone network service charges and pager
fees will cut Bt2200 million ($US87.3m) from government agency
revenues but are expected to boost subscriber demand.

The reductions, following a government directive, will cut Telephone
Organisation of Thailand (TOT) revenues from mobile network
service charges by Bt1000 million ($US39.6m) and pager revenue
by Bt500 million ($US19.8m).

The Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) will lose Bt400
million ($US15.87m) from mobile network service charges and
Bt300 million ($US11.9 million) from pager revenue.

The 27 percent cut in revenue share by government agencies from
1 January has already fuelled campaigns by five pager network
operators operating under government concessions to broaden
their customer base. Most are planning big marketing campaigns,
network expansion and the introduction of new, cheaper models of
pagers in anticipation of a 20 percent growth in demand during
1996.

A Bt500 ($US19.8) monthly service fee paid by cellular network
subscribers will later this month be cut to Bt400 ($US15.8), in
keeping with the government's policy to reduce mobile telephone
costs and improve services.

Negotiations are now underway between government agencies and
mobile network operators Total Access Communication Plc and
Advanced Information Service Plc to reduce air time fees from
blocks of one minute costing Bt3 ($US0.10) to 20 second blocks.

The CAT has also asked the TOT to cancel the domestic telephone
access charge of Bt200 ($US7.9) a month in light of the service fee
reduction.

($US119.07m). Third quarter 1995 revenue was Bt4.029 billion
($US159.9 million) with net profit of Bt1.141 billion ($US45.28
million). The group, comprising 13 subsidiaries, expects to allocate
more than Bt2000 million ($US79.38m) in overseas investments
and more than Bt1000 million ($US39.39m) in local investments
this year. Government-issued telecommunication concessions are
Jasmine International Group's main domestic revenue source.

% The Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) has been
allocated a 1996 operational budget of Bt24,190 million ($US960
million). Deputy transport and communications minister Sombat
Uthaisang said that the regular rate on overseas telephone calls
would be cut by 5 percent from early February, cutting Bt500 million
($US19.84 million) a year from the agency's revenues. This was in
addition to a revenue reduction of Bt700 million ($US27.78m) from
cuts in mobile network service charges and pager fees.

PHILIPPINES - POWER COMPANY FINALISES PLANS FOR FIBRE
OPTIC CABLE BACKBONE

The state-owned National Power Corp (Napocor) has finalised its
plans to put up a $US83.86 million fibre optic cable backbone and
lease the facility to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Corp of
the Philippines (Teleophil) consortium.

Napocor president, Guido Delgado, told Telenews Asia that the
plan would soon be submitted to the Napocor board for approval.

The cable project, otherwise known as the national digital
transmission network (NDTN), will be completed within one year
and will interconnect the power company's Luzon, Visayas and
Mindanao grids. It will be 2,300 kilometres long and pass through
all the nation's major cities.

Delgado also said that Teleophil will lease Napocor's dark fibre and
absorb the cost of terminal equipment.

Teleophil is investing $US150 million in the NDTN to compete with
the Philippine Long Distance Telephone company's (PLDT) existing
backbone. In November Teleophil announced that because the
eight participants in the consortium each have individual authority
from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to
operate as carriers the consortium will not have to apply to the
Congress for a franchise for the project, an obstacle which has
bedevilled Belltel's attempt to become the major competitor to
PLDT's nationwide monopoly of services (TNA November 30,
1995). Telenews Asia understands that by tacitly approving the
Teleophil strategy the NTC has removed many of Belltel's obstacles
as well.

Meanwhile, Italy's Pirelli Construction Co has offered to finance the
Napocor project. According to Frolian Tamonpinco, Napocor's
corporate planning group manager, Pirelli is also interested in a
supply agreement with Napocor for the cable project.

Delgado said that Teleophil will realise savings because the power
company will charge only a fraction of the $US2.30 per-circuit-
kilometre lease charge. He also said that there is no need to form a
telecommunications subsidiary because the project is only an
added business for Napocor.

PHILIPPINES - PLDT SATELLITE FACES DELAY

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT)-led Mabuhay
Philippines Satellite Corp may suffer delays in the launching of its
satellite because of a conflict involving Indonesia and Japan over
orbital slot allocation.

The conflict involves the acquisition of the 144 degrees-east orbit
location to be used by the Japanese Superbird satellite and the
Mabuhay in partnership with the Pasik Satelit Nusantara (PSN) of
Indonesia.

The Mabuhay consortium, which also includes PSN, had earlier
abandoned a co-registration with the Philippine government and
instead opted to utilise an Indonesian-registered slot to launch its
satellite by November 1996.

In a letter to Japanese deputy minister for policy coordination,
Yoshio Utsumi, the telecommunications undersecretary, Josefina
Lichauco, said that the acquisition of the orbital slot of Mabuhay's
rival - the Philippine Agila Satellite Inc - applied for a 147-degree
east degree slot, which may have possible interference with the 144
degree east proposed slot of Japan and Indonesia.

Indonesia is undertaking coordination meetings with Japan
because Japan filed an application for the slot ahead of Indonesia
with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for Ku-band,
or broadcast operations using, the 144-degree east location.

Indonesia upgraded its application in November 1994 to cover C-
band, or telecommunications operations, and Ku-band operations
using 144-degree east.

The Philippine government, however, had three months earlier, filed
for a 147-degree east slot for both C-band and Ku-band operations
on behalf of the Agila consortium.

Indonesia is therefore required to coordinate with the Philippine
government on possible interference with the Agila project. The
Philippines, similarly has to coordinate with Japan.

"Japan was not aware of the plans to add Ku-band to the Palapa
Pacific filings, and Indonesia was not aware of the Japanese
intention to move N-Sat-146 from 146-degrees east to 144-degrees
east", Lichauco said, citing delays at the ITU in the publication of the
information submitted by each administration.

The communications official said that it the intention of the
Philippines government to write to the Indonesian government
informing them of the Philippine position.

Meanwhile, Mabuhay has increased its capital stock to P1 billion
($US38 million) from P320 million ($US12m), according documents
submitted to the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission
on 9 January.

PHILIPPINES - STATE CARRIER SIGNS INTERCONNECT DEALS

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) is set to sign
three more interconnection agreements with telecommunication
companies after signing an interim agreement with Isla
Communications Co Inc (Islacom) on 10 January. The agreement
will pave the way for the interconnection of their respective phone
networks.

The agreement is the sixth PLDT has signed with its competitors
and allows PLDT's competitors to piggy-back on PLDT's nationwide
network, saving them time and the cost of building their own
telecom backbone.

The interconnection allows direct dial access for subscribers of
PLDT and Islacom, doing away with operator assistance.

Islacom is a joint venture between Asiacom Philippines and
Thailand's Shinawatra International.

Late in 1995 PLDT signed interconnect deals with Globe Telecom,
International Communications Corp, Philippine Telephone/Capitol
Wireless and Digital Telecommunications Philippines.

Agreements with Smart Communications, Eastern
Telecommunications and Major Telecom are expected within the
next few days.

PLDT vice-president, Nestor Virata, said that new players will share
in the cost of interconnection facilities on a 50:50 basis within each
of the new telecommunication company's service areas. However
the cost for calls made outside of the new companies service areas
but still within Metro Manila will depend on the traffic of total number
of calls.

Outside Metro Manila, calls will be charged based on the regular toll
sharing arrangements adopted with the members of the Philippine
Association of Private Telephone Companies. Virata told Telenews
Asia that the companies had agreed on a tentative flat rate of P800
($US30.5) per month.

AUTRALIA - SECOND CARRIER STALLED BY ENVIRONMENTAL
LOBBY

Plans by Australia's second carrier, Optus Communications, to
break Telstra's monopoly on the local loop by installing an above
ground network capable of delivering pay TV and telephony is
facing stiff opposition on environmental grounds.

In 1995 Optus Communications, the licenced second carrier, set up
a joint venture company, Optus Vision, with US cable TV operator
Continental Cablevision and Kerry Packer's Publishing and
Broadcasting Ltd to install a hybrid fibre co-axial network which
would deliver pay TV and telephony. Optus Vision secured
agreements from a number of power utilities for access to their
above ground distribution network and has been installing cables
on power poles in Australian suburbs for several months. Pay TV
services commenced on the network late in 1995.

Telstra retaliated by forming a joint venture with News Ltd, Foxtel, to
offer pay TV services and installing its own hybrid fibre coaxial
network, but initially for pay TV only. Telstra, however is primarily
using its existing network of underground ducts to install its cable.

Both carriers enjoy exemption from local government planning
requirements but are required to consult with councils and the local
community under a telecommunications national code before
installing and telecommunications infrastructure.

A number of councils have objected to Optus Vision's unsightly
above ground cables and have initiated legal action accusing the
company of breaching the code in its handling of the consultation
process.

The councils scored their first victory in late December when a
judge in the Victorian Supreme Court granted a temporary
injunction restraining Optus Vision from further cabling in the city of
Boroondara. The judge found that the provisions of the Federal
Telecommunications Act which grant exemption are so wide as to
create widespread uncertainty in their application. The council's
lawyer had argued that the exemptions could even be invoked to
grant Optus employees exemption from state speed limits. The
judge also said it was arguable that the exemptions, granted to the
carrier Optus Communications, could not be claimed by its Optus
Vision subsidiary.

The code was due for review before mid 1997 as part of a policy to
end the Optus Telstra duopoly and open up the market to greater
competition and Communications Minister Michael Lee announced
on 20 December that the exemption from state and local
government planning rules would be removed.

However critics of the government say that this will be too late.
Telstra and Optus are racing to build their networks as fast as
possible in the belief that the first network in an area will have a
strong advantage and deter the competitor from duplicating it.

Telstra has repeatedly insisted that it would not be practicable to
permit Optus to share its cable ducts, but the government is coming
under increasing pressure to force it to do so or make some other
policy change to halt what many see as an unnecessary and costly
duplication of infrastructure.

AUSTRALIA - DRAFT OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT
RELEASED

The Australian Government has released a for-comment draft of
new telecommunications legislation that will come into effect in July
1997. It will replace the current 1991 legislation which ended the
government owned carrier's monopoly on basic services in favour
of liberal resale and a duopoly on basic services.

The draft comprises two main items of legislation, the
Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the Trade Practices
(Telecommunications) Amendments Bill 1996.

The new Telecommunications Bill will remove almost all barriers to
entry into all telecommunications services but will limit the market
power of the incumbents by instituting access codes under which
they will be obliged to make their networks available to competitors.

Under the draft bill legislative control on competition will be shifted
into general competition law under the Trade Practices Act,
administered by the newly formed Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission (ACCC) the necessary amends to that Act
are contained in the Trade Practices (Telecommunications)
Amendments Bill 1996.

Separate legislative provisions will apply to service providers and
carriers. Anyone will be able to become a service provider but may
be declared a carrier by the ACCC against criteria set out in the
telecommunications bill. Any service provider with substantial
control over customers through its own switches is likely to be
declared a carrier, even if it does not own any transmission
infrastructure.

A carrier will be required to give undertakings to provide access to
its services and facilities in accordance with codes and standards.

The draft legislation is based on a set of 99 proposals developed by
the Department of Communications and the Arts and released on 1
August 1995 (TNA August 10 1995). Co-incident with the release of
the draft legislation, the government issued a further 39 proposals.

The additional proposals seek to minimise government control over
technical regulation which will be "primarily addressed through
industry self regulation involving affected groups including
consumers". However the industry regulator, to be formed by the
merger of Austel and the Spectrum Management Agency, will have
a reserve power to mandate standards where appropriate or where
self regulation fails.

Standards will be required to be based on international and
regional standards unless this is inappropriate. Carriers and service
providers will be free to develop their own network standards but
these must be co-ordinated with interconnection, customer
equipment and cabling standards.

The controversial Telecommunications National Code under which
the existing carriers enjoy protection from state and local
government planning requirements will be reviewed and carriers
will cease to have power to override planning rules.

The draft bills are open for comment until 16 February 1996.

NEW ZEALAND - TELECOM NZ PAY TV PLAN STYMIED BY
LEGAL ACTION

The battle between New Zealand carriers Clear Communications
and Telecom New Zealand over pay TV escalated in late December
when Clear successfully gained an injunction preventing Telecom
New Zealand from proceeding on plans to conclude a pay TV
programming agreement with Sky Television.

Telecom NZ is planning to wire 6000 homes in the country's two
largest cities, Auckland and Wellington to deliver pay TV and
broadband services and has tried to gain programming through the
agreement with Sky. Clear had earlier challenged Telecom NZ's
plan to acquire the 25 percent of Sky shares held by its own major
shareholders, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. Clear argued that such
an acquisition would create a dominant player in the telephony and
pay TV industries. Clear has not indicated any intention to enter the
pay TV or local loop telephony markets.

Clear lawyers were granted access to the confidential programming
agreement and claimed that it constituted a serious breach of the
country's fair trading legislation, the Commerce Act.

The injunction preventing the agreement proceeding until a further
hearing was granted on 21 December. Telecom NZ says it will
defend the action. Its share acquisition plan is dependent on the
programme sharing agreement, and so has also been put on hold.

SRI LANKA - DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL APPOINTED FOR
TELECOM PRIVATISATION

The government has appointed a five member consortium led by
German investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell to advise on
the restructuring and privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT).

The Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Managala
Samaraweera, said in a 9 January statement that the consortium
had been given until July to submit a proposal for the restructuring.
The government will then select a strategic partner and decide how
much of the company will be privatised.

Telenews Asia understands that initially 20 percent of SLT will be
privatised, however it is unclear as to what percentage will be open
for foreign investment. SLT holds a monopoly over all aspects of
telecommunications in Sri Lanka except cellular services. The
government's move to privatise SLT by the Public Enterprise
Reform Commission is opposed by Sri Lanka's trade unions who
want it to remain a fully government-owned enterprise.

Samaraweera also announced the government's plan to set up two
private telephone companies which will provide 200,000 wireless
telephone lines within the next four years. Samaraweera said that
more details on the companies will be released after 12 January.

The Deutsche Morgan Grenfell-led consortium includes Deloitte
Touche, Tohmatsu International, Slaughter and May and the
Development Finance Corp of Ceylon.

Meanwhile the chairman of SLT, Hemasiri Fernando, said that SLT
needs a SLRp20 billion ($US370 million) injection or it will run into
financial difficulties later in 1996. Fernando said that SLT had a
turnover of SLRp8 billion ($US150 million) in the 1994-5 financial
year, but profits were low. With 17.5 million people Sri Lanka has
200,000 telephone lines.

TAIWAN - PARLIAMENT PASSES PRIVATISATION LEGISLATION

Taiwan's parliament on 30 December finally passed legislation
which will lead to the privatisation of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications (DGT) within five years. The first step of the
process will be the complete privatisation of mobile phone and all
wireless telecommunication services. Domestic long distance
telephone services will be privatised after five years.

As the crucial bill was being passed about 4,000 DGT employees
tossed eggs and beer cans at the legislative building and
threatened to stage a strike. The vice premier, Hsu Li-teh, appealed
to the protesters for support, saying that the bill was crucial to
Taiwan's trade liberalisation.

Both the World Trade Organisation and GATT have made Taiwan's
membership conditional on the privatisation of the DGT (TNA
September 21, 1995). The government has promised the 36,000
employees that it will continue to employ the workers. However it
has rejected the protesters' demand for representation on the board
of directors of the new company.

In October the communication minister, Liu Chao-shiuan, told
parliament that paging services, mobile cellular services, mobile
data transmission, trunked radio communications and vsat services
will be opened to private Taiwanese and foreign partners as soon
as the relevant legislation passes parliament (TNA October 19,
1995).

Business Taiwan reports that at least 20 Taiwanese consortia and
international telecommunications enterprises have entered the race
to win licenses to run personal-communications services. The paper
quotes a DGT internal memo which says that the 1994 revenue from
mobile phone communications was around $NT20 billion ($US740
million). Even after deducting operating costs, the return on
investment was triple the operating costs.

Taiwanese companies that have reportedly expressed an intention
to bid for operating licenses include: Pacific Electric Wire & Cable
Co; Walsin Lihwa Electric Wire & Cable Co; President Enterprises
Group; Koo's Group; Taiwan Electrical and Electric Manufacturers'
Association; Vidar Sun Moon Star Co; Acer Inc; Fubon Insurance;
Chinese Automobile Co; Sin Kong Life Insurance Co; China Rebar
Co; and Taiwan Telecom Network Service Company.

International companies which have already arranged joint
ventures with Taiwanese companies include: BT, Vodafone,
Singapore Telecom, Hongkong Telecom, AT&T, McCaw Cellular
Communications, Bell South Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp.

One foreign telecommunications official is quoted as saying that
foreign companies assumed that the privatisation process would be
less open and they therefore used political considerations and
diplomatic influence rather than know-how to form alliances with
local companies.

However, the passage of the privatisation bill will now see the DGT
only issue licenses through financial bidding and therefore there
will be a free-for-all.

The DGT held a public hearing on 15 December to discuss
frequency allocation and decided to open the 900 MHz and 1,800
MHz frequencies to private mobile phone communications
operators, as well as frequencies between 284.5 MHz and 285.5
MHz to private paging communications operators.

For the mobile phone frequencies, 1,800 MHz will be open to
operators of digital systems while the 900 MHz frequency will be
open to operators of GSM systems.

DGT's initial plan is for the 1,800 MHz frequency to cover the entire
island, while the 900 MHz frequency can be either divided into three
regions or can cover the island. The government favours dividing
the band from 284.5 MHz and 285.5 MHz into three regions.

According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC)
statement, capitalisation of at least $NT2 billion ($US74 million) will
be required for a regional mobile phone operator and capitalisation
of at least $NT6 billion ($US222 million) will be needed for an
island-wide mobile phone operator.

For paging communications operators, capitalisation of at least
$NT200 million ($US7.4m) will be needed for regional operations
and capitalisation of at least of $NT400 million ($US15m) will be
needed for island-wide operations.

Pacific Electric Wire & Cable Co (PEWC) has criticised the form of
DGT privatisation, saying that it will favour large corporations. Lee
Ta-cheng, PEWC's president, says that bidding was an
irresponsible measure "because the student who makes the best
score in a contest may not be the richest student." Besides those
who win the bid with sky-high prices may try to get back their outlay
from their clients, according to Lee. "Although PEWC is also a
consortium, this method that benefits only consortia should be
changed."

MOTC officials responded that bidding is the fairest way for entrants
because it can prevent the authority in charge of the bid from being
lobbied, and because bidding can help increase national revenues.

Some experts predict that by 2000 Taiwan will be among the
world's top 10 mobile phone using countries. The mobile phone
population is currently 600,000, with a monthly increase of some
20,000 users. There are approximately two million pager users in
Taiwan, with a monthly increase of 30,000.

PAN ASIA - FIRST STAGE OF GLOBAL FIBRE OPTIC LINK LAID

The first stage of the 27,000 kilometre, 120,000 circuit, Fibre optic
Link Around the Globe (Flag) has been laid between Italy and
Egypt.

Scheduled for completion in 1997, the Flag project will form a
broadband network between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Asian landing sites have been finalised in India, Malaysia, Thailand,
Hong Kong, Korea and China.

Flag is jointly financed by Nynex, Dallah Al-Baraka of Saudi Arabia,
Thailand's Telecom Holding Co, Japan's Marubeni, Hong Kong's
Asian Infrastructure Fund and General Electric. On 10 January the
Flag board of directors appointed Joseph Timpanaro, a Nynex
senior vice president, as chairman and chief executive officer.

According to Timpanaro, more than 50 international carriers have
already bought circuits on Flag.

AT&T Submarine Systems and KDD Submarine cable Systems are
the contractors for Flag's installation (TNA October 6, 1994). Cable
& Wireless Marine has been subcontracted to install approximately
two thirds of the cable.

PAN ASIAN BRIEFS

% Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corp, South Korea's only
cellular phone service provider, is planning to become the first
private South Korean company to list on the New York Stock
Exchange. The company is expected to seek approval from the
Ministry of Finance & Economy to float depository receipts (DRs) in
the second quarter of 1996, according to a financial official at Korea
Mobile Telecom. The amount of the DRs have not yet been decided,
but the official expected it to be around $US150 million.

% Japan's NTT has disclosed its estimates of the cost of splitting it up
into separate entities. Before a meeting of the Telecommunication
Council, the panel affiliated with the posts and telecommunications
minister, NTT said on 9 January that a breakup into three
companies - one long-distance operator and two regional
companies covering the eastern and western parts of Japan would
create a tax burden of around 1.800 trillion Yen ($US17.1b)

% The overall amount of capital outlays by Japanese
telecommunications companies in the fiscal year through 31 March
1996 is expected to grow 21 percent from a year earlier to 3.700
trillion Yen ($US35b). In a survey carried out in October 1995 by the
ministry covering 1,021 domestic telecommunications companies,
investment expectations were revised up from the 14 percent
increase that was predicted in a March 1995 survey. The upward
revision is in part traced to hefty spending on mobile
communications such as the PHS.

SINGAPORE - SINGAPORE TELECOM SIGNS INTERCONNECT
AGREEMENTS

Singapore Telecom (Singtel) has signed interconnection
agreements with mobile service operators Mobileone, ST Paging
and Intrapage. The agreements will allow the new service operators
to interconnect their networks to Singtel's public switched telephone
network.

Mobileone, owned by Singapore-listed Singapore Press Holdings
and Keppel Corp and a Hongkong Telecom joint venture, will be
charged rates of $S0.07 ($US0.04) per half minute during peak
hours and $S0.07 per minute during off-peak hours. These rates
correspond to those charged for incumbent operators Mobilelink
and Pagelink. The access charges are valid for three years.

Intrapage is a consortium led by Hutchison telecommunications. ST
Paging includes companies in the Singapore Technologies group
and Bellsouth International. The three operators will begin services
on 1 April 1996.

Meanwhile, Mobileone has awarded a $S50 million ($US36m)
supply contract to Nokia for its GSM network. Under the contract
Nokia will supply, install, test and commission the network, using
Nokia's DX 200 mobile switch unit and deploying an Intelligent
Network.

Meanwhile, Pagelink has announced the launch of a wireless E-
mail access via its Dataroam network.

SINGAPORE TELECOM TAKES OVER IN EASTERN INDONESIA

A consortium involving Singapore Telecom International (STI) and
Indonesia's PT Bukaka Telekomindo International, which won a bid
to develop a telephone network in eastern Indonesia, has taken
over operations of telecommunications services in Bali, Lombok,
Timor, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya (see Indonesian story, p4).

STI has a 40 percent stake in the consortium which will spend
$US400 million on installing 400,000 lines in addition to operating
a further 500,000 lines that come with the 15 year agreement.

Meanwhile, STI has announced that it has called a tender for supply
of switches and transmission equipment. Three suppliers are said to
have been shortlisted and a decision is expected soon after a final
round of negotiations so that the installation of the new lines can
begin by mid-year.

GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE LAST DECADE OF THE 20TH CENTURY

     With this New Year, we are entering the last decade of the
Twentieth Century--a century that has thrust upon us more change
and advancement of knowledge than all of the millennia of human
history that has gone before.  It is said, for example, that one
weekday edition of The New York Times contains more knowledge
than a man in the 16th century was exposed to in a lifetime.
     The beginning of this century saw the dawn of the
communications revolution: sending messages by both wire and
through the air.  In the last half of this century, we mastered
sending messages to space and back, and created a wholly new
medium: pulses of light rather than electricity.  We have filled
the air--the spectrum--with so much information that we are
challenged to find ways to increase the capacity of our radio
systems.
     Human culture, society and personality are all functions of
communication.  Thus, each advancement in our ability to
communicate alters the fabric of culture, society, and
personality.
     Christian Schwarz-Schilling, West Germany's minister of
posts and telecommunications, reflected this when he recently
told a luncheon audience in Washington:  "Whatever may have been
responsible for the onset of the democratic movements in Poland,
Hungary and East Germany, it can be said that this would not have
happened without telecommunications.  Without telecommunications,
information on the free West would not have penetrated the
communist countries, which were sealed off from the outer world
by barbed wire and walls.  Without telecommunications, the call
for freedom would not have spread so rapidly."
     As we enter this decade, we are about to radically alter our
planet.  The miracle of flight is credited with shrinking the
Earth...of compressing time.
     The miracle of telecommunications is beginning to do
something even more miraculous: it is eliminating time and
distance all together.  It is putting the entire community of man
in instant contact with one another, and will increase the
communal power to communicate, transact and inform.
     Most other industries that are international in scope only
import and export.  Goods are produced in one country and sold in
another.  There is a growing element of that type of
international business in telecommunications as well, but there
is another, more unique, aspect to telecommunications in the
"global village": the provision of global communications requires
partnering and cooperation to a far greater degree than mere
trading.
     Some of the events of 1989 foreshadow what the telecom
business climate of the next decade will become:
     MCI and the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. have already
agreed on a protocol, and are forming a joint venture to link
their videoconferencing networks.
     AT&T wants to expand telecom circuits between the Soviet
Union and the United States using Russia's Intersputnik satellite
system.  Last month, AT&T introduced direct dialing between the
United States and Moscow.
     AT&T, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), and British Telecom
introduced digital services among their 3 countries and entered
calling card billing agreements.  They are also offering
international ISDN.  The 3 companies continue to sign agreements
with carriers in other countries expanding this international
ISDN network.
     KDD has opened offices in New York and London.
     Voicecom is partnering with British Telecom to offer voice
messaging in the United Kingdom and Europe.
     Nynex International and the Telecommunications Authority of
Singapore have agreed to cooperate on joint marketing and
technical studies.
     U S West acquired CATV companies in the United Kingdom and
Hong Kong, and is in a joint venture with Magyar Posta to build a
cellular network in Hungary.
     Telefind signed an agreement with Japan Steel Works and has
affiliations in other countries around the world to create a
global paging network.
     PacTel is part of a consortium awarded a license to build
and operate a cellular system in West Germany.  BellSouth is in a
consortium that has inaugurated cellular mobile service in Buenos
Aires.
     The U.S. Commerce Department organized telecom trade
delegations to Zurich and Vienna in Europe, and to Mexico,
Colombia and Venezuela.  It also has slated its second Southeast
Asia Telecommunications Conference in Pattaya, Thailand from Feb.
26 to March 1, 1990.
     This list is just an example of thousands of new
international business arrangements, cooperative ventures, joint
ventures, and distribution agreements that have been formed by
telecommunications companies.  Such international ventures are
not limited to the multi-billion dollar companies in the
business.  Newbridge Networks, for instance, signed a
distribution agreement with Sumitomo; formed a joint venture with
the Soviet Ministry of Radio; and, in 2 years, became the second
largest supplier of multiplexers in Europe.  Farmstead
International has formed joint ventures in China to refurbish and
market AT&T central office switches.
     The process that will drive the next decade is a closed
loop: to increase international business and commerce requires
that we provide better international communications.  The act of
creating the infrastructure for better international
communications, in turn, increases international business.
     The technical pieces are all in place:
     Voice messaging eliminates the barriers of time zones.
     The digitization of telephone networks worldwide provides
the platform.  Hong Kong, for instance, plans to have a 100%
digital network in place by 1993.
     ISDN integrates all communications media for transport.
     Fiber optics exponentially decreases the cost per circuit.
     Technologies such as facsimile, E-mail, and text-to-speech
make it possible to integrate messaging media.
     Technologies like IMMC's Ultraphone and Solarex's solar
power sources for telecom mean that sophisticated communications
can be brought affordably to areas other than those of great
population density.
     Increased processing power at a lower cost, coupled with
incredibly sophisticated programming skills, will bring
instantaneous computerized translation to communications,
eliminating the final barrier between peoples--that of language.

     *TELEPHONE NEWS salutes its readers and industry for the
giant strides it has made in the last century, and for its
emerging global perspective today.  It is even possible that the
restrictions imposed on the regional Bell operating companies
will, in the future, turn out to be blessings.  Those RBOCs that
have turned to international opportunities may, in the long run,
be stronger than if more of their resources had been devoted to
the domestic markets from which they have been barred.
     Aside from commerce, this industry has bettered our life by
such acts as bringing the deaf into the world of the hearing, it
has saved lives with enhanced 911, and it has helped integrate
our disparate peoples with multi-lingual communications systems.
     In this, the final decade of the century, you will be
uniting the world through enhanced communications planet-wide,
and in doing so, will be fostering the good will and cooperation
among men that we wished one another this past holiday season.
     TELEPHONE NEWS and Phillips Publishing wish you a happy and
prosperous New Year, and resolve to bring you another year of
news, analysis and insight to further your endeavors.

U S WEST TO OFFER NEW, AFFORDABLE  E9-1-1

     U S West Communications said that it has  developed a new
telecom service which will allow affordable Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-
1) to small and medium-sized communities.  The newly
announced service was developed over the past 2 years by U S West
Communications; U S West Advanced Technologies; Stratus
Computers; and Mitel.
     U S West will initially market the new E9-1-1 service in its
14-state service area after completing additional technical and
marketing trials.  The new architecture will also be available in
1990 to national and international customers for installation and
testing in trial sites.
     Current E9-1-1 service consists of networking that includes
facilities and routing of calls placed to 9-1-1; the database,
which includes every telephone number and service address in a
given 9-1-1 service area; and customer premise equipment (CPE).
In most cases, the database and networking portions of the
service are leased from the local telco, and are available only
through specific types of central offices (COs).  The answering
and dispatch centers, usually part of local police or government
operations, generally purchase the CPE equipment from a variety
of vendors.
     U S West Advanced Technologies developed proprietary
applications software to run the system, and Mitel's GX5000, with
a Host Command Interface protocol, provides the switching
functions.  The Stratus XA 2000 performs the necessary functions
to generate and translate information, tells the switch where to
direct the emergency phone call, and displays information about
the source of the call to E9-1-1 dispatch terminals.
U S WEST'S NEW E9-1-1 IS PORTABLE, USES ONLY 1 NETWORK, & LESS
EXPENSIVE CPE

     U S West's new E9-1-1 system contrasts from current E9-1-1
technology in that existing E9-1-1 systems require 2 separate
networks--one for voice and the caller's phone number--and the
second, a data network, retrieves and delivers the caller's
location information.  The new U S West E9-1-1 software
integrates both voice and data retrieval information into one
system, and then sends that information simultaneously to the
dispatch center.
     The new E9-1-1 platform will also allow customers to use
less expensive CPE in answering and dispatch centers.  CPE
requirements include a data terminal with 12 function keys, a
standard single line telephone, a notification device and a
printer.  In 1991, an optional interface for computer-aided
dispatching systems will be available from U S West.
     Lastly, the U S West service is portable and can be deployed
in any CO.  According to U S West, each service platform, or
feature node, will accommodate from below 30,000 subscriber lines
to over 300,000 lines, but the best economic results are realized
between 30,000 and 300,000 access lines.  Future plans include
multiple platforms that could be tied together--utilizing an
optional intertandem transfer feature--to support additional
lines.

INTERFACE WILL ALLOW NEW SERVICE TO WORK WITH ANY CO

     U S West filed its network disclosure statement with the FCC
in November and will begin an 8-month internal technical trial of
the service in Fremont County, Wyo., (county pop: 16,800)
beginning in May 1990.  The new E9-1-1 is scheduled for
deployment by U S West in its area during first-quarter 1991.
     "Inside our region, we will be marketing the system as a
turnkey solution," said Ken White, manager for public safety
product development for U S West Communications.  "Outside our
area, due to the MFJ, all U S West will be selling is the
software package, and we're still in the process of developing
co-marketing arrangements with systems integrators.  U S West
developed the software specifically for Stratus, and Mitel was
the only CO switch manufacturer that could give us an interface
to manipulate the service.
     "The transport costs between a small community and a CO can
be expensive.  Our new platform application puts service closer
to the community and reduces those transport charges.  Our
platform has been designed, but we are still in additional
development stages.  Once our optional interface is complete--
which should be around the end of the year or 1st quarter of
1991--we will be able to use the service in any CO.  Then we will
begin active and aggressive marketing.  The type of existing CO
will be inconsequential to deploying the service because of this
interface.  That's why this announcement is significant.
     "U S West has tested the service in our lab for the last 8
months, and it has past all feature and functionality tests with
flying colors," added White.  "But the medium must exist for the
system to correct itself and be remotely monitored.  In small
communities, COs are not monitored 24 hours a day, but liability
on 9-1-1 systems dictate that the system's heartbeat is monitored
full time, which will occur when the interface is deployed.
     "We've determined that there are 600 counties in our 14-
state area that are too small to afford current 9-1-1 technology
today.  That is the market that we are targeting."  (U S West
Communications, 1600 Seventh Ave., Room 3213, Seattle, WA 98191,
206/346-9998.)

INDIANA BELL TRIALING HOME ENERGY  MANAGEMENT TELECOM TECHNOLOGY

     Indiana Bell is providing the telecom technology that is
allowing Indiana Michigan (I&M) Power to conduct a 12-month
energy test program in Muncie, Ind.  The trial, involving 154 I&M
customers, could help consumers to manage their electricity
consumption more efficiently and lower their electric bills.
During the trial, test customers will use a special thermostat--a
TranstexT "Smart" unit developed by Johnson Controls--to measure
and adjust the amount of electricity used.  Indiana Bell's
network will permit 2-way communication of electrical consumption
and billing information between I&M and the 154 homes.
     The TranstexT thermostat will allow users to automatically
adjust the temperature on their electric heating/cooling systems
and water heaters at certain hours of the day, when electric
rates are higher or lower.  Indiana Bell's telephone lines and a
communications set in the customer's home will automatically
route the energy management information from the thermostat to
the electric utility's computer system and vice versa.  The
communication system will not affect customer use of the
telephone because the computer cannot transmit energy management
data if the telephone is in use.
     "This project is just one of many applications that will
allow consumers to more efficiently manage their energy use,"
said Pat Moss, Indiana Bell business manager.  "The data
transmitted over our network will help I&M determine how to
reduce the amount of electricity used during peak hours, thereby
lessening its need for expansion, and, in the long run, helping
its customers save money."  (Indiana Bell, 220 North Meridian
St., Indianapolis, IN 46204, 317/265-2583.)

SIEMENS RELEASES WORLD TELEPHONE STATS

     According to recent statistics compiled by Siemens, there
are approximately 455 million telephones in the world today.  The
statistics, the result of inquiries made to telecom
administrations worldwide, showed that citizens of the United
States use the telephone more frequently than others--an average
of 1,800 times a year per person.  Canada was a close second with
1,451; Denmark with 861; and the Australians with 593.
     The United States also had more telephones, 127 million,
followed by Japan with more than 50 million, and the Soviet Union
with approximately 28 million.  The telephone directories of the
world added 22 million new entries, for a total of 454 million
numbers--an increase of 5% over the previous year.  In Indonesia,
there are 30,000 people for every pay phone, contrasting with
only 100 per pay phone in Switzerland.  The Swiss place the most
international calls, an average of 28 per person.  The Belgians
are next with 12 times per person a year, and the Dutch third
with nearly 11.
     In 1987, the United States invested over $26 billion in
telecommunications, followed by Yugoslavia, which invested $15
billion.  The People's Republic of China added nearly 1 million
new telephones in 1987--an average of one telephone for every 100
people.  Turkey increased its telephones by nearly 50%, but still
has only 7.9 telephones per 100 people.  (Siemens Public Switch-
ing Systems, 900 Broken Sound Parkway, Boca Raton, FL 33487,

BELL-HAUN'S SUCCESS AND FUTURE BASED ON SERVICING DAYLIGHTS OUT
OF CUSTOMERS

     Tom Bell, CEO of Bell-Haun, a Westerville, Ohio-based
interconnect, and his partner, Mike Haun, met back in the mid-
'70s when they were both working in a large banking environment.
"Mike and I started up Bell-Haun basically as a hobby," said
Bell.  "Mike is the engineering part of our team and I'm the
front man.  We sold one system, then another, and by 1977 it was
pretty apparent that I could make sales rather quickly.  We also
did all the installations and have been a service-oriented
business right from the start.  "Our sales were based on
referrals from satisfied customers and now, some 12 or 13 years
later, they still represent a major source of our new business,"
added Bell.  Every 13 weeks Bell-Haun sends out a newsletter to
its' customers on company and product news.  "We get a lot of
positive feedback from the newsletters.  It helps to set us
apart, and gives us an edge."  The newsletter is also sent out
with proposals and to Bell-Haun's suppliers and vendors.
     "Bell-Haun is a service business.  Phones are phones.  The
difference in equipment is a difficult thing for a consumer to
see.  To us, the phone is a means to an end.  We sell the best
equipment available, but if all of those manufacturers go out of
business, we would still be around--we would just go to the
second best and still provide our customers with the best service
available.  We work very hard with our existing customer base
because a satisfied customer is the best lead to a new customer.
It gives us the inside track.
     "We focus on little things," said Bell.  "All of our
technicians wear uniforms supplied by the company, and all of our
vehicles are fleet maintained.  We try to follow the same
philosophy as UPS or Fed Ex.  Our office is located in a high-
rent area of the city, so when we bring clients to the office for
a demonstration, they see a stable, professional atmosphere.
They know that Bell-Haun is committed to its business.  That's
what we stand for.  Overall we use the soft sell approach yet we
want our presence felt," Bell added.  Bell-Haun is a 5-Star
Ameritech Dealer and handles Iwatsu, Mitel, and Motorola, and is
also a Centrex and data agent for Ohio Bell.
     "In 1985 we became an agent for Ameritech Mobile
Communications, and have installed over 8,000 cellular phones.
For the past 2 years, we have been working on what we call
Project '90 which focuses on voice messaging.  We see that as a
major new growth area for the company."  Bell-Haun is a
distributor of Teleconnect and AVT voice processing equipment.
"We want to position ourselves in the Columbus business community
as the answer to a customer's communications requirements."
Bell-Haun's customer base is between 4,000 and 5,000 but Bell
said that number was somewhat inflated because it includes
cellular only users.
     "We have always maintained an attitude that we want to be
the best.  Being the biggest is second to quality.  The
interconnect business has changed a lot during the 1980s, and it
will continue to change.  The emphasis on quality will only
increase.  I don't spend time watching competition, but I want my
people to know our competitor's systems.  I believe that the
successful company has to service the daylights out of a customer
to keep them your customer."  (Bell-Haun Systems, 935 Eastwind
Drive, Westerville, OH 43081, 614/882-4040.)

APC SAYS NEW PCS SYSTEM DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH BALTIMORE RAIL
SYSTEM

Personal communications service (PCS) licensee American Personal
Communications has rejected claims that its new wireless
communications system is causing interference with the operations
of Baltimore's mass transit system.  Last week Maryland's
Department of Transportation informed APC that its PCS system has
caused "serious interference" to the light rail and bus service
serving Baltimore and other metropolitan destinations.  The
letter had been circulated by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association--a Washington-based trade group that represents
several incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2
gigahertz band.  Today, UTC issued a statement retracting the
letter and acknowledging that it had been distributed without the
Transportation Department's consent.

Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, told TR that
APC plans to issue a complete statement tomorrow disputing the
claims outlined in the letter.  She said UTC's involvement was
suspect and expressed concern over the trade group's effort to
"politicize" the effort to relocate microwave incumbents in the
portion of the 2 GHz band allocated for the new PCS services. 
Ms. Schelle stated that previous interference problems with
Baltimore's mass transit system have been resolved.

The letter from Maryland's Transportation Department recounts two
occasions last fall when APC's PCS system disrupted
communications systems for Baltimore's mass transit operations. 
"These communications interruptions have posed a grave threat to
public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated.  The Transportation
Department also asked APC to reimburse Maryland's Mass Transit
Administration (MTA) for all costs that it has incurred as a
result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment on the interference problems further, because
it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

AT&T ANNOUNCES $6 BILLION RESTRUCTURING PLAN INCLUDING
ELIMINATING 40,000 JOBS OVER 3 YEARS

ATT Corp. today announced a $6 billion restructuring as the next
step in its plan to break up into separate services,
systems-technology, and computer companies.  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert E. Allen told employees that
reorganizations planned to establish the separate telecom
services (New AT&T) and systems-technologies companies likely
would result in 30,000 layoffs.  AT&T announced plans today to
eliminate almost 40,000 jobs over the next three years, but that
figure includes more than 6,500 management employees who accepted
an early retirement offer (TR, Nov. 20, 1995) by year-end.  It
does not include the 8,500-job cut announced by AT&T Global
Information Solutions last September.  The computer unit took a
$1.17 billion posttax charge against third quarter earnings to
cover the costs of its separate restructuring.

AT&T said it may extend the voluntary separation offer to
additional employees of its services and systems-technologies
units, and Mr. Allen said such an extension would reduce the
number of job cuts to be achieved through layoffs.  He added that
about 4,000 of the jobs to be cut are in "businesses we plan to
sell."  Workers in those units should be able to keep their jobs
under new ownership, Mr. Allen said.  A company spokesman said
about 60% of the 40,000 jobs targeted for elimination over three
years are "in management categories."   AT&T plans to complete
about 70% of the job cuts this year, but other cuts will be
announced throughout the three-year period, a spokesman said. 
"We know the types and levels of jobs" to be cut, but "we won't
know specifics" for some time, he added.

AT&T said 6,000 to 7,000 jobs will be cut in New Jersey, where
the company currently employs about 48,000 persons.  Despite the
cuts, AT&T will maintain "a major presence" in New Jersey, where
headquarters for the new services and systems-technology
companies and major Bell Laboratories operations will continue. 
About 10,000 of the positions to be cut will be "corporate-wide
staff jobs in functions such as information systems, human
resources, and financial operations," AT&T said.  The remaining
cuts, which will occur in operating units of the two new
companies, will include about 6,000 "administrative and
back-office support positions," it added.  The "vast majority" of
the cuts will involve jobs in the U.S.

Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr said the
job cut announcement will "demoralize" AT&T's workforce and set
back cooperative union-management programs under development
during the last three years.  "We didn't even receive the
courtesy of advance notification of today's mass cutback
announcement," Mr. Bahr said.  "So far we have no idea even how
many of CWA's 80,000 members at AT&T may be impacted by the
cutbacks, and apparently neither does AT&T.  I was informed by
the head of labor relations that it will take up to 60 days to
provide details on jobs and locations that will be affected."  A
CWA spokesman confirmed that meetings have continued between CWA
and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers officials and
their AT&T labor relations counterparts to discuss plans for the
breakup.  But CWA officials got no advance notice in the meetings
of today's cutback announcement, the spokesman said.  IBEW's
national offices in Washington were closed today for the New
Year's holiday.

To implement a complex restructuring that a spokesman said
involves hundreds of separate actions, AT&T will take a posttax
charge totaling about $4 billion or $2.50 per share against
fourth quarter 1995 earnings.  About $2.6 billion of the $6
billion pretax restructuring charge will cover severance pay and
other costs related to the workforce reductions.  An additional
$1.7 billion is earmarked to cover the costs of writing down the
value of certain assets, including unneeded network facilities
and investments in certain international units.  As an example of
such an investment write-down, AT&T cited its partnership
interest in the Canadian Unitel Communications, Inc., competitive
long distance operation.  AT&T and three Canadian banks agreed
last fall to invest up to $250 million to keep the financially
struggling competitive carrier in operation (TR, Oct. 2, 1995). 
The AT&T spokesman clarified that "we're not writing off Unitel. 
We plan to continue to use it as the base of operations for
telecom services in Canada."

The spokesman said AT&T also plans to "refocus" its United
Kingdom Istel data network operations to align it more closely
with strategic business plans of AT&T's Uniworld European
networking partnership.  Foreign sales offices for Network
Systems and Global Business Communications Services and foreign
manufacturing operations will be consolidated "where that makes
sense," a cable manufacturing plant in Ireland will be improved,
and another plant in Taiwan will be retooled, the spokesman said. 

Closing, selling, or consolidating facilities determined not to
be "strategic to the new companies' future operations," including
lease terminations, will cost about $1.1 billion, AT&T said. 
Other actions included in the reorganization plans will cost
almost $700 million.  The cost savings from the restructuring
measures will ensure the new AT&T companies' ability to "make the
necessary investments to be strong competitors," said Rick
Miller, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.  AT&T intends to launch the new companies with sizes,
assets, and corporate structures appropriate to industry leaders,
he said.

AT&T said it will not identify specific actions involving job
cuts until affected employees are notified and said it cannot
disclose other steps included in the reorganization plan because
of disclosure restrictions imposed by the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission in relation to a planned initial public
offering (IPO) for the systems-technology company.  Mr. Miller
said AT&T has begun preparing the SEC registration statement for
the IPO, which is expected to go to market by the end of this
quarter.  AT&T also has requested an Internal Revenue Service
ruling that the breakup into three companies can be accomplished
as a tax-free transaction for shareholders, he said.

FCC REMAINS CLOSED; AUCTIONS TO BEGIN TOMORROW

Sources within the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
confirmed today that the agency would continue three auctions of
radio licenses this week despite the ongoing government shutdown. 
The sale of multipoint distribution service licenses will begin
tomorrow (Wednesday), and the specialized mobile radio and "C"
block personal communications service auctions will start Jan. 4
and Jan. 5, respectively.  The Commission remained closed today,
although "essential" staff in the wireless bureau and several
attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel were working
today.  A notice offering furlough loans to FCC employees was
posted on agency walls as a grim reminder of the shutdown, which
now is in its third week.  The U.S. Premier Federal Credit Union
is offering loans at a discounted rate of 7% for six months. 
Qualified employees can obtain loans up to the amount of lost pay
but not exceeding $5,000.

WASHINGTON COMMISSION CLARIFIES 1995 COMPETITION RULES

The Washington Utilities & Transportation Commission has altered
and clarified "final" rules adopted last year (TR, Nov. 6, 1995)
establishing terms and conditions for local exchange competitors
to interconnect with U S WEST Communications, Inc., and
GTE-Northwest.  The action was in response to petitions by
several local exchange competitors.  The commission denied a GTE
petition to reconsider last year's order but granted requests by
AT&T Corp., MCI Communications Corp., Teleport Communications
Group, and several other companies to modify provisions
addressing interconnection, unbundling, and interim number
portability.  The commission's original order made no mention of
GTE, and competitors had sought clarification that GTE also was
subject to the number portability requirement.

The new order requires U S WEST and GTE to file unbundled loop
tariffs offering access to two-wire connections from end-users'
premises to the U S WEST and GTE central offices.  Petitioners
had sought a requirement that the incumbent LECs offer four-wire
connections that would enable them to offer digital
communications services.  The commission found that the two-wire
requirement was adequate to speed development of competition for
most local services.  It ordered U S WEST and GTE to file interim
number portability tariffs based on their incremental costs.  The
companies may assess nonrecurring charges, but those charges also
must be set at the companies' incremental costs, the commission
said.

The WUTC denied a request by AT&T and MCI that U S WEST and GTE
be required to offer all of their services for resale.  The
commission's original order only requires incumbents to offer
unbundled loop and other transport services.  The interexchange
carriers had claimed that the development of competition in the
state also depends on competitors' ability to resell bundled and
tariffed services.  The commission said that a general
elimination of resale restrictions would be better addressed in a
general rate case.  AT&T, which had asked the WUTC to reconsider
its earlier order, called the order "another step toward
achieving the goal of widespread local competition in
Washington."  U S WEST and GTE have 30 days to file the required
tariffs.  See Monday's TR for more details.

MARYLAND PSC SETS INTERCONNECTION, RESALE RATES

The Maryland Public Service Commission has set the rates and
conditions for interconnection and other aspects of local
exchange competition in the state.  The commission established
standard rates for terminating local traffic and the terms for
local competitors to resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's local
service.  The PSC also adopted an interim number portability plan
and granted competitors the flexibility either to establish new
local calling areas or to use those of Bell Atlantic. 
Additionally, the commission required all carriers to provide
"911" service and launched a separate proceeding to examine
universal service issues.  The PSC in 1994 authorized MFS
Intelnet, Inc., to be the first provider of competitive local
service in the state (TR, May 2, 1994 and Aug. 8, 1994).  It
since has authorized MCImetro and TCG America, Inc., to enter the
local exchange services market.  TCG today endorsed the
commission order.  Later this month the PSC is scheduled to
consider an application by AT&T Corp. to provide both business
and residential local service (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).

REFORM LEGISLATION AWAITING BUDGET DEAL

Action on compromise telecommunications reform legislation
hammered out before the holiday break likely will be delayed
until a budget deal is struck, Washington sources said today. 
Only a few Senate conference committee members have signed off on
"final" language circulated just before Christmas (TR, Dec. 25,
1995).  Most conferees plan to stay in their districts until
budget negotiations between congressional leaders and the White
House are completed, so they cannot sign the conference report. 
"Until there is a deal on the budget, you're not going to find
the bulk of the members coming back," said an industry lobbyist. 
Despite initial opposition from key Republicans such as telecom
subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R., Texas), the source
predicted that a majority of conferees will approve the measure.

Lack of active opposition by industry--combined with the support
of Senate Democrats and the White House--has paved the way for
approval of the conference language, said another close observer
of the reform negotiations.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R.,
Ga.) is unlikely to oppose the reform bill because speculation
about his ties to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch would
leave him open to conflict-of-interest charges, the source said.

CITIZENS ACQUIRES ALLTEL'S CALIFORNIA PHONE PROPERTIES

Citizens Utilities Co. of Stamford, Conn., today announced the
acquisition of almost 20,000 telephone access lines in California
from ALLTEL Corp. and the transfer of 3,600 Citizens access lines
in Pennsylvania to ALLTEL.  The acquisition is part of a
definitive agreement announced in November 1994 for Citizens to
purchase about 117,000 telephone and cable TV lines in eight
states (TR, Dec. 5, 1994).  The 1994 deal was valued at about
$292 million.  Previously, Citizens had purchased ALLTEL
telephone properties in West Virginia, Oregon, and Tennessee.  It
also had acquired ALLTEL CATV franchises in Arizona, California,
and New Mexico.  Purchase of ALLTEL's Nevada telephone property
is expected to be completed this year.  When the ALLTEL
transaction is completed, Citizens' operations will extend to 20
states.

Wireless Industry Pledges To Resolve Hearing Aid Compatibility
Problems

     Conceding that all digital wireless communications systems
potentially may cause electromagnetic interference, wireless
industry representatives have pledged to develop ways to make their
services accessible to the 6 million people in the U.S. who wear
hearing aids.  During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4
in Washington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipment
manufacturers and service providers should have the flexibility to
determine what transmission technologies they will use in the
future.  But the Commission must ensure that people with
disabilities have access to telecom services, he added.

     Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called the
European model of mandating the use of specific digital wireless
technologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us into
mandating their particular technology for the use of the airwaves,"
he said.  But market forces will not necessarily lead to the
resolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must be ready to
protect the interests of groups that traditionally have wielded
little power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.

     Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacy groups
should work together to identify compatibility problems, he
continued.  "This will be a continuous process because repeatedly
we will find incompatibilities between wireless devices and hearing
aids."  He said the Commission expects specific "action items" to
be generated by the two-day summit meeting, which was sponsored by
the Personal Communications Industry Association.

     The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year by hearing
aid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested that the FCC
initiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systems using the
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital wireless
standard to interfere with hearing aids (TRWN, June 15, 1995). 
Wireless industry representatives, however, told the Commission
that it would be premature to launch such a rulemaking proceeding
before conclusive test results were available (TRWN, July 27,
1995).

     During last week's meeting, industry representatives
emphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibility
already is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, reported that the Center for the Study of
Electromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will release
the initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also is conducting
a field evaluation of bystander interference problems using the
personal communications service (PCS) network recently activated in
the Washington, D.C., area by American Personal Communications. 
Results of that research are expected to be available Feb. 15.  Mr.
Wheeler said digital-service interference problems are no more
daunting than those the cellular industry faced when it introduced
analog wireless equipment more than 10 years ago.

     Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wireless phones
meet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,
CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids that
are designed and tested to meet the requirements of the European
Commission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard for
hearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised a
technical standard for phones based on the code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers can
turn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,
which can be a source of interference for some types of hearing
aids.

Plug-in Devices Help Hearing Aid Wearers

     According to panelists at the meeting, several devices are
available that enable hearing-impaired people to use digital
telephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, for example,
can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-coil"
(t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on the hearing
aid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals to use the
mobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a "JABRA"
device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearing aids.

     George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,
said the availability of such devices does not mean the wireless
industry should stop developing other alternatives for people with
disabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or they will
pay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some 22
million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "and there
isn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough to ignore 10%
of the population."

     Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted its
responsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wireless
technologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs, who
wears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientific
research will provide us with long-term solutions for resolving
electromagnetic compatibility issues."

     Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,
Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research and
development arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a Senior
Engineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)
transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aid
interference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitude modulated,
he explained.  Such pulse signals are common with mobile phones
based on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said, adding that all
PCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitude modulation.  "Higher
RF output increases the range of interference, but that is why the
FCC has set limits on output levels," Mr. Williams said.

     Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering for
the Advanced Products and Technology Division of the Cellular
Subscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving from
the use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to the use
of several antennas with low-power radios.  That will lead
manufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devices
that can minimize radio interference problems, he said.

S&P Revises Financial Guidelines For Wireless Telephone Companies

     Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising the
financial guidelines it applies to ratings of wireless
communications companies.  The business risks associated with
cellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to the
extent that many firms can sustain less stringent financial ratios
for the same credit ratings as companies in other industries, S&P
concluded last week.  The new guidelines apply to cellular and
personal communications service (PCS) companies, although PCS
operators are expected to face many of the same start-up risks as
the early cellular companies.

     That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhat
worse-than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringent
financial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It cited dramatic
growth in cellular subscribership as the reason that business-risk
profiles of cellular companies have improved.

     The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be used to
assess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecom companies
that own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  These include AT&T
Corp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holding companies, and major
independent telecom companies such as GTE Corp.  "Although the
wireless segment does not represent a majority of these companies'
assets, it is their fastest growing segment," S&P observed.  "Under
the revised benchmarks, companies with significant cellular
holdings are now viewed as being somewhat less risky, while those
with a major commitment to PCS are viewed as still having
significant credit risk for the PCS portion of their wireless
business." 

     S&P will use the following measurements to determine the
credit ratings of wireless communications companies:

     *    Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement of
income before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--that
indicates "earnings protection."

     *    EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement of
cellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relative
to total interest cost.  This measures a company's minimum ability
to meet interest costs using available cash.

     *    The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relative
to cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determine a
company's debt "exposure."

     *    Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt to
total "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continue
to be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimate
generally the asset value of a particular market.  The debt-per-pop
ratio indicates some degree of financial flexibility.

     *    Debt per subscriber.  As the number of cellular
subscribers increases, S&P believes a more meaningful measurement
of financial risk may be the ratio of debt to the number of
subscribers.  This is because part of a cellular company's revenues
are used to service debt costs.

     In determining the business risk profile of wireless carriers,
S&P considers a number of market factors, including capital
intensity, barriers to entry, competing technologies, economic
conditions, marketing costs, "churn" rates (which measure the loss
of subscribers to competitors), and the unregulated nature of the
industry.  For more information about S&P's wireless financial
guidelines, call Timothy E. Caffrey at 212/208-1750.

Alcatel Wins Multimillion-Dollar PCS Contract from Sprint Venture

     Alcatel Network Systems has signed a "multimillion-dollar"
agreement with the Sprint Telecommunications Venture (STV) to
supply equipment and relocation services to incumbent licensees
operating microwave systems in the 2 gigahertz spectrum band.  An
Alcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, but he
said the deal could be worth millions of dollars, considering that
Sprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS) in up
to 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services, Sprint
must pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbent
licensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.

     Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrum-relocation
projects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Last year STV won PCS
licenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, and Indianapolis "Major
Trading Areas" (TRWN, March 23, 1995).  

     Alcatel plans to supply incumbents with new radio equipment
designed to operate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haul
equipment interconnecting cell sites.

     Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell Mobile
Services, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipment
for the relocation of public safety wireless facilities operated by
the County of Santa Barbara, Calif.  

     The Alcatel spokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spend
about $1 million to relocate five microwave links for the county. 
That estimate is in line with other industry estimates, which put
the cost of relocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.

     Alcatel--which has submitted bids to all PCS licensees
planning to upgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects to
announce similar relocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. and
BellSouth Personal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  He
said there is a $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.

Arch To Acquire Westlink In $210 Million Paging Deal

     Arch Communications Group, Inc., has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire Westlink Holdings, Inc., for $210 million in
cash and the assumption of $130 million in Westlink debt.  The deal
will make Arch the third-largest paging carrier in the U.S., with
more than 2.5 million subscribers.  Arch will finance the
acquisition through an existing credit line and additional loans. 

     A privately held company, Westlink was formed in 1994 to
acquire the paging assets of U S WEST Paging, Inc. (TRWN, Oct. 21,
1993; and July 14, 1994).  Westlink operates paging systems in a
14-state region west of the Mississippi, while most of Arch's
paging assets are concentrated east of the Mississippi.  According
to C.E. Baker Jr., Arch's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the
acquisition "will effectively complete the geographic footprint
that makes us a national player."

     Arch also will gain access to other paging licenses through
Westlink's 49.9% stake in Benbow PCS Ventures, Inc., the winner of
two regional narrowband personal communications service (PCS)
licenses sold at an FCC auction last year (TRWN, Nov. 17, 1994). 
Arch currently owns about 11% of PCS Development Corp., a
Greenville, S.C., company that won five regional narrowband PCS
licenses at the same auction.  Arch plans to resell that company's
two-way paging services when commercial operations are launched in
1997.

     Separately, AirTouch Communications, Inc., announced the
completion of its acquisition of privately held Message Center
Beepers.  Hartford, Conn.-based Message Center will contribute more
than 345,000 customers to AirTouch Paging's installed customer
base.  Message Center executives also announced the formation of a
new company to provide Internet access, cellular, and long distance
services in major eastern U.S. markets.  The new company, dubbed
ZipCall L.L.C., will be based in Hartford.  Its network will
feature ISDN (integrated services digital network) and frame relay
capabilities.  Customers will have toll-free access to the Internet
and will be able to take advantage of a variety of high-speed,
dial-up access plans.

APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Network Interference Problems

     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that its
personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering with
the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recent
letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) stated
that the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" to
the communications operations of light rail and bus services
operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.  

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressed
concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" the
effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands. 


     The relocation of incumbent operators has been a contentious
issue since the FCC first drafted rules requiring 2 GHz licensees
to clear that band to make way for new PCS licensees (TRWN, Sept.
24, 1992; and July 29, 1993).  The Commission recently clarified
rules adopted in the Engineering and Technology docket 92-9
"emerging technologies" proceeding, further defining "good faith"
negotiations over relocation issues between licensees (TRWN, Oct.
16, 1995).

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications system.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. 
The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred as
a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment further on the interference problems, noting
that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Ms. Schelle told TRWN that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.  

     The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that APC
planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials failed
to respond to a single one.  "Microwave licensees that ignore
frequency coordination notices do so at their own peril," the APC
attorney stated.  "PCS licensees can only protect licensed
facilities if they are informed of the complete parameters of those
facilities' operations.  APC fully protected the facilities
represented on MTA's FCC license and could not have known, without
being informed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance from
those parameters."

Canadian Government Awards Four Nationwide PCS Licenses

     As the third U.S. auction of personal communications service
(PCS) licenses got under way, Industry Canada announced that it had
awarded four nationwide PCS licenses.  Clearnet Communications,
Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, and MicroCell Network, Inc., of
Montreal, each were awarded 30 megahertz PCS licenses.  Rogers
Cantel Mobile, Inc., and Mobility Personacom Canada Ltd., were
awarded separate 10 MHz licenses.  Industry Minister John Manley
said the four new licensees will invest more than $3 billion to
develop their PCS systems.  He estimated that 8,500 new jobs will
be created over the next five years as the PCS market develops.

     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses to
noncellular companies will create a sound industry structure, which
should facilitate the development of enhanced competition and
innovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.
Simmonds.  Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobile
radio networks for businesses in major metro areas.  Nextel
Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholders
in Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with its
PCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in two
Canadians is interested in using new personal communications
services.

     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is a
start-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.  A group of
Canadian cable TV companies is among the other major investors in
MicroCell.  Rogers Cantel, one of two incumbent cellular service
providers in Canada, will use its 10 MHz license to expand its
current service offerings.  

     Based in Etobicoke, Ontario, Mobility Personacom is an
affiliate of Mobility Canada, the other Canadian cellular carrier. 
Mobility Canada is a national corporation whose "member companies"
are the 11 cellular affiliates of the provincial landline telephone
companies.  The four Canadian PCS licensees will operate their
systems on the same frequencies as their counterparts in the U.S.--
between 1.8 gigahertz and 1.9 GHz.

SBC Affiliate Wins Authority To Offer LEC Service in Chicago

     The Illinois Commerce Commission has authorized an SBC
Communications, Inc., affiliate to offer landline local exchange
service in the greater Chicago area, enabling it to compete
directly with Ameritech-Illinois.  SBMS Illinois Services, Inc., an
affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. (SBMS),
submitted an application last year seeking permission to provide
local exchange services.  The commission's decision will allow it
to offer wireline services under the Cellular One brand name--the
same name SBMS uses to market cellular service in Chicago.

     An SBC spokesman said SBMS Illinois will file intrastate
tariffs during the first part of 1996.  The company plans to offer
service in an area including Cook, DuPage, and Kane Counties, and
portions of McHenry, Kendall, and Will Counties.  Last October, SBC
was authorized by the New York Public Service Commission to offer
local exchange service in upstate New York.

     SBMS currently offers cellular service to customers in the
Rochester and Buffalo metropolitan statistical areas, also under
the Cellular One brand name.

     The spokesman told TRWN that SBC aggressively is exploring
local exchange markets outside its traditional five-state
territory.  The company is particularly interested in bundling
cellular and wireline services in markets where it already operates
cellular systems, including Boston, Baltimore, and Washington,
D.C., he said.  The fact that Massachusetts and Maryland already
permit competition for the provision of facilities-based, switched
local exchange services may prove helpful to SBC.  In Washington,
city government regulators are considering proposed competition
rules.

     The spokesman confirmed that SBC intends to offer wireline
services and not fixed wireless local loop services in Chicago and
upstate New York.  But he declined to identify how the company will
put together its local exchange network.  SBC is considering a
number of possible options, including reselling local exchange
services, he said.

     Last October the FCC granted SBMS a rule waiver allowing it to
bundle cellular and wireline local exchange services and to offer
them to out-of-region customers (TRWN, Nov. 2, 1995).  Commission
rules preclude cellular affiliates of Bell operating companies from
owning landline local exchange facilities.  Pursuant to the waiver,
SBMS has proposed to offer what it calls "competitive landline
local exchange services" through a corporate entity that shares
facilities, systems, and personnel with SBMS' cellular operations. 
That business would be managed by the same executives who manage
SBMS.

'Bill-and-Keep' Method of Interconnection Proposed for LECs, CMRS
Providers

     In an effort to encourage the development of new wireless
services, the FCC recently proposed implementing a new
interconnection regime allowing local exchange carriers (LECs) and
commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers to terminate one
another's calls without charging the originating carrier for call
completion.  

     This interconnection method, generally known as "bill and
keep," currently is used among LECs.  During its most recent public
meeting, the Commission voted to adopt a rulemaking notice to
establish a similar policy, on an interim basis, for LEC-CMRS
interconnection.  Under the proposal, carriers would be permitted
to keep the revenues from calls originated on their own networks. 
This new interconnection model had been proposed by the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).

     "Interconnection is an essential component of all networks,"
observed Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina M. Keeney.  Although
the FCC already has general interconnection rules, they do not take
into account the proliferation of new wireless service providers
that will be handling an increasing volume of voice traffic, she
added.

     The rulemaking proposal, which launched docket 95-185,
"tentatively concludes that the interim plan [should include] a
bill-and-keep approach for most network components, for both peak
and off-peak hours," said Kathleen L. Franco, a Common Carrier
Bureau staff attorney who presented the NPRM for Commission
consideration.  

     "Bill and keep is administratively simple, will prevent LECs
from charging excessive interconnection rates, and will likely
approximate the incremental costs of terminating traffic, at least
during off-peak periods," she explained.

     The NPRM seeks comment on how long the interim plan should
remain in effect.  It also seeks comment on how interconnection
arrangements should be made public--either through tariffs or
through some other public disclosure requirement.  The Commission
tentatively concluded that rates for dedicated transmission
facilities connecting LEC and CMRS networks should be based on
existing access charges (usually flat-rated fees) for similar
network facilities.

     The proposal invited comments on whether the FCC should adopt
the following:

(1) A federal interconnection model that would directly govern
interstate LEC-CMRS interconnection but that would not be binding
on state regulatory commissions for intrastate services; 

(2) A general mandatory interconnection model with broad
parameters, giving state commissions a range of choices regarding
LEC-CMRS interconnection obligations; or 

(3) A model with specific requirements for interstate and
intrastate interconnection between LECs and CMRS providers.  

     The Commission tentatively concluded that it has the legal
authority to implement any of those alternative approaches, based
on section 332 of the Communications Act.  According to David
Sieradzki, a Common Carrier Bureau staff attorney, the first option
would give state regulators the most flexibility.  Under that
option, the FCC would be responsible for regulating interstate
interconnection requirements, but intrastate interconnection
obligations would be determined by state regulatory commissions. 
The third option, which calls for the FCC to adopt specific
interconnection rules, would offer states the least flexibility,
Mr. Sieradzki said.  "The FCC is very intent on working
cooperatively with the states on interconnection issues," he added.

Commissioners Promise To Cooperate with States

     Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett said state and federal
jurisdictional issues should be reviewed carefully during the
proceeding.  "While the Commission makes several tentative
conclusions in the [NPRM] concerning its legal authority, I
emphasize that these findings are tentative. . .and that we will
consider all relevant arguments and theories."  He noted that 33
states so far have removed barriers to local exchange competition. 
"Washington, Texas, Pennsylvania, and California, to name a few,
have been at the forefront on these issues and have implemented
bill and keep as an interim arrangement," he said in a separate
statement.  "I will do my part as a member of this Commission to
ensure that our continuing efforts will be fully coordinated with
the state regulators."

     Chairman Reed E. Hundt said, "We have good relations with the
states, and we want to continue to work with them on this issue." 
The interim interconnection plan "proposes an intensely practical
solution," Mr. Hundt said.  He advised commenters to "think very
hard about the economics of this policy and about the market power
of LECs versus the market power of CMRS providers."  He added that
the FCC must consider adopting regulations that "will not burden
wireless carriers." 

     In a separate statement, Commissioner Susan Ness said, "We
must not abridge the LECs' legal or equitable rights, distort
marketplace incentives for CMRS providers, or cause prices for
other LEC customers to increase."  

     The Commission "must seek to maintain the federal-state
cooperation that we have worked so hard to develop," she added. 
Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong said she would prefer that the FCC
not require carriers to file tariffs with voluminous cost-support
data.

FCC Adopts Competitive Bidding Rules for 800 MHz SMR Licenses

     The FCC has adopted an order outlining a wide-area licensing
scheme for the 800 megahertz specialized mobile radio (SMR)
service.  In a separate order, it set competitive bidding rules for
800 MHz SMR licenses.  And in Private Radio docket 93-144, it
adopted a rulemaking proposal to relocate incumbent 800 MHz SMR
licensees in order to accommodate wide-area systems.  The FCC
sought comment on a proposed "two-phase" mandatory relocation
scheme that would make new 800 MHz SMR operators responsible for
providing incumbent licensees with comparable network facilities.

     During its Dec. 15 public meeting, the FCC adopted its "first
report and order" in docket 93-144, dividing the upper 200 channels
in the 800 MHz band into three spectrum blocks for wide-area
licensing.  The 200 channels will be divided into separate blocks
of 120, 60, and 20 channels, designated according to "economic
areas" (EAs) defined by the Commerce Department.  These licenses
will be sold at auction.  The Commission adopted a 10-year license
term and a five-year construction period for EA licensees.  These
licensees must offer coverage to one-third of the population in
their service area after three years.  Half the population must be
covered after the five-year construction benchmark.

     The order also reallocated the General Category channels--
which include 150 contiguous 25 kilohertz channels--in the 800 MHz
band to the SMR service.  It partially lifts the "freeze" on new
SMR and General Category channels, so potential EA license
applicants can relocate incumbents out of the upper 200 channels in
the 800 MHz band.

     In the "eighth report and order" in Plans and Policy docket
93-253, the FCC implemented rules to award 525 EA licenses in a
single, simultaneous-multiple-round auction.  Incumbents and new
entrants are eligible to bid for EA licenses.  The order permits
qualified small businesses to use bidding credits, and it allows
rural telephone companies to acquire parts of other EA licenses. 
This process is referred to as "partitioning."

     Finally, the FCC's "second further notice of proposed
rulemaking" in docket 93-144 tentatively concluded that EA
licensees should be allowed to "disaggregate" their spectrum
blocks.  The FCC defined disaggregation as "assigning discrete
portions of the spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee." 
Accordingly, the entity that is assigned a portion of the spectrum
would receive a separate EA license to operate on the disaggregated
channels throughout the license area.  The FCC also proposed
extending the partitioning rules to SMR licensees generally, rather
than limiting it to rural telephone companies.

     Regarding relocation, the Commission suggested that an EA
licensee's offer to replace an incumbent's system with comparable
facilities constitutes a "good faith" offer.  Similarly, an
incumbent that accepts such an offer "presumably would be acting in
good faith," the agency said.  It proposed that "comparable
facilities" be defined as having the same number of channels with
the same bandwidth.

     The rulemaking proposal tentatively concludes that 800 MHz SMR
channels should be licensed on a geographic basis defined by EAs. 
The Commission proposed licensing the lower 80 channels in the 800
MHz band in five-channel blocks.  It also proposed licensing the
General Category channel blocks in the same manner.  It proposed to
offer bidding credits and to auction an "entrepreneur's block" of
licenses that would be limited to qualified small businesses.

     Commissioner James H. Quello remarked that the 800 MHz
licensing rules "have been so highly contentious that [the orders
are] unlikely to satisfy everyone."  Chairman Reed E. Hundt said
many people had voiced concerns about the 800 MHz service rules. 
The orders adopted last week offer "the best possible degree of
consensus," he said.

     Nextel Communications, Inc., the largest SMR operator in the
country, praised the new 800 MHz licensing rules.  It said the
rules give Nextel and other SMR licensees "the opportunity to
assemble individual licenses into large blocks of contiguous
spectrum," similar to what cellular and personal communications
service providers are able to do.

FCC Proposes Auctioning 37 GHz, 39 GHz Licenses, Revises Technical
Rules

     To make more spectrum available for point-to-point microwave
radio operations, the FCC has adopted a rulemaking notice that
would amend the licensing and technical rules for systems operating
in the 37.0-38.6 gigahertz band, also known as the 37 GHz band.  It
also has proposed to revise licensing and technical rules for
systems operating in the 38.6-40.0 GHz band, also referred to as
the 39 GHz band.  The agency proposed to auction the 3 GHz of
spectrum divided between the two bands and to offer bidding credits
and other incentives to qualified auction participants.  The
Commission also voted to process pending 39 GHz license
applications, with Chairman Reed E. Hundt and Commissioner Susan
Ness dissenting.

     The Commission's proposal to amend parts 1, 2, 21, and 94 of
its rules stems from a rulemaking petition (RM-8553) filed by the
Telecommunications Industry Association.  At last month's public
meeting, the FCC proposed auctioning spectrum licenses based on
"Basic Trading Areas."  To accommodate incumbent operators, it
proposed to give existing 39 GHz licensees 18 months from the
adoption of an order in the proceeding to certify that they have
constructed "a minimum average of four permanently installed and
operating links per hundred square kilometers" of their licensed
service areas.  This equates to about one link per 10 square miles.

     Incumbents with more than one channel block of spectrum would
be required to certify that each channel block contains at least
four permanently installed and operating links.  If a licensee met
these threshold requirements, it would be eligible to retain rights
to serve its entire service area.  If an incumbent did not meet
these requirements, it automatically would lose its license 19
months after adoption of an order, the Commission said.  

     The FCC proposed adopting such measures in order to prevent
speculators from "warehousing" spectrum.  The 37 GHz and 39 GHz
spectrum bands have been identified as potentially valuable
property by those who intend to provide infrastructure for
commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers.  Some companies
plan to use the spectrum to offer backhaul facilities for new
personal communications service licensees, the FCC observed.

     Regarding the hundreds of pending 39 GHz applications, the
Commission ordered the following action:  Pending applications will
be processed if they were not mutually exclusive with other
applications at the time the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
stopped accepting new applications.  The FCC also proposed to apply
the same rules to these applicants as it proposed for incumbent 39
GHz operators.  

     Other pending applications will not be processed at this time,
although the FCC will determine whether to process or return them
at the conclusion of this proceeding.  An exception to this policy
would be extended to 39 GHz incumbents that filed applications to
modify their systems without enlarging their service areas.

Hundt, Ness Dissent from Majority

     Commissioner James H. Quello reiterated his long-standing
position that pending applications should be processed according to
the rules that were in effect when they first were filed. 
Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong emphasized that
non-mutually-exclusive license applications do not fall within the
FCC's auction authority.  

     "Indeed, even if we had auction rules in place today, these
[39 GHz] applications would not be subject to auction.  Under
section 309 (j) of the Communications Act, the Commission has
authority to use competitive bidding only where mutually exclusive
applications are filed," she said in a separate statement. 
Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett made similar comments in his
separate statement.

     Commissioner Susan Ness said the majority's decision to
process the pending 39 GHz applications will result in a "Swiss
cheese effect," leaving holes in the spectrum that later will be
auctioned.  Chairman Reed E. Hundt also dissented from the
majority.  "There is no longer any serious dispute that sound
public policy requires assigning spectrum licenses by competitive
bidding except where there are clear and compelling public interest
reasons to the contrary," he said, adding that "no compelling
reasons have been given here."

FCC Allocates Spectrum for 'Millimeter-Wave' Applications

     The FCC has allocated 6.2 gigahertz of spectrum in the bands
above 40 GHz, establishing technical rules for the development and
introduction of "millimeter-wave services," (MWS) such as
automobile radar collision-avoidance systems.  Acting at its Dec.
15 meeting, the Commission adopted an order in the Engineering and
Technology docket 94-124 proceeding, approving the allocation of
three separate bands available for unlicensed use (TRWN, Nov. 3,
1994).

     The Commission allocated the 46.7-46.9 GHz and 76-77 GHz bands
for "smart car" systems.  In addition to collision warning and
avoidance, applications for such systems could include "automatic
cruise control" and "lane guidance," the Commission said.  To
protect vehicle safety systems from interference, use of the bands
will be restricted to such "smart car" operations at this time. 
The Commission also adopted a rulemaking proposal to suspend the
use of the 76-77 GHz band by amateur radio operators until sharing
technologies are developed.

     For "generic unlicensed use," the FCC designated the 59-64 GHz
band.  Such generic uses could include broadband computer
networking at data speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second. 
Transmission speeds over the MWS bands could approach those of
fiber optic systems, but only over short distances.  The Commission
will delay its allocation of the 59-64 GHz band for one year,
however, enabling industry groups to propose standards for spectrum
etiquette.  Wireless industry groups had sought such a delay before
unlicensed operations were permitted in the band.

     In its NPRM, the FCC sought comment on what those etiquette
standards should be.  It also proposed establishing limits on
emissions in the 200-231 GHz band and said that several additional
rulemakings could be initiated in the future to address operations
in the millimeter-wave bands.

     The new rules are "some of the most flexible ever offered by
the Commission," said Michael J. Marcus, Associate Chief of the
Office of Engineering and Technology.  Chairman Reed E. Hundt
agreed, calling them "a corollary" to the Commission's spectrum
auction policy.  The FCC should make available to industry spectrum
for which there are no competing demands, Mr. Hundt said.  The
proposal to allow the industry to suggest its own code of spectrum
etiquette demonstrates the FCC's willingness to be flexible when it
is appropriate, he said.

'Bill-and-Keep' Proposal Could Create More Local Exchange
Competition

By Roger Newell, Senior Contributing Editor

     In its last meeting of 1995 the FCC took steps to establish an
important component needed for competition in the local exchange
market.  The Commission adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking
that would implement a "bill-and-keep" method of interconnection
for local exchange carriers (LECs) and commercial mobile radio
service (CMRS) providers. Currently, when a call originated by a
cellular carrier is terminated by a LEC, the cellular carrier must
pay an access charge to the LEC.  When the call travels in the
opposite direction, however, the LEC does not pay anything to the
cellular carrier to complete the call.

     This imbalance has resulted from the monopoly position of the
LECs, which allows them to dictate the terms for interconnection. 
Access charges typically range from 2.5 to 3.5 cents per minute. 
According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,
cellular carriers paid more than $800 million in access charges in
1994.  

     Without changing the current method of compensation for
CMRS-LEC call completion, this amount would rise significantly as
competition in the local exchange market is spurred by the advent
of personal communications services (PCS). The FCC's proposal to
institute a bill-and-keep system, under which each carrier would be
required to terminate traffic received from the other without
payment, would remedy this problem on an interim basis.  

     Accordingly, each carrier would keep the entire revenue from
calls that it bills.  This is an important step forward.  Fair and
reasonable rates and terms of interconnection are essential for the
development of local exchange competition.  As Commissioner
Rachelle B. Chong has noted, "Timely and reasonably priced
interconnection is the lifeblood of competition among alternative
service providers."

     Although a charge of about 3 cents per minute may not seem to
be much, it could have a chilling effect on competition.  A one-way
payment by one competitor to another tilts the playing field and
prevents equal competition.  

     The effect is not small; even 3 cents is a significant
percentage of cellular rates, which typically are around 35 cents
in many markets.  If, as the FCC hopes, the launch of PCS this year
results in lower rates for telephone service, the access charges
would loom as an ever-larger percentage of LEC revenue.

     Replacement of the one-way payment method with a bill-and-keep
mechanism represents a sea change in the position of wireless
carriers.  From the inception of the service in the early 1980s,
cellular carriers have had the legal right to interconnect with
LECs as co-carriers.  This also entitles them to mutual
compensation for interchanged traffic.  The necessary agreements
were never executed, however, resulting in the present one-way
payment arrangement.  (Some LECs have argued that the access
charges were reduced to compensate for the lack of mutual
compensation).  The present situation favors the LECs, leaving them
with little incentive to negotiate mutual compensation agreements.

'Bill and Keep' Presents Milestone for CMRS Providers

     With bill and keep, however, the situation is reversed.  The
overwhelming flow of traffic is from the wireless carrier to the
landline carrier.  This is largely because cellular service
requires subscribers to pay relatively high charges for airtime for
incoming and outgoing calls.  As a result, many cellular
subscribers reserve their handsets for outgoing calls.  Thus, bill
and keep could cause the landline carriers to lose considerable
revenue.  The incentive to negotiate a fair mutual compensation
arrangement now shifts to the landline carrier, and the way is
cleared for new carriers to compete on economically viable terms.

     The bill-and-keep proposal is intended to effect a sort of
rough justice until more sophisticated and accurate methods of
compensation for call termination are developed.  It would provide
equity between LECs and their competitors only if the amount of
traffic in each direction is approximately equal.  The flow of
traffic, however, is likely to remain uneven at least during the
next few years.  But bill and keep is more equitable than the
current one-way system.

     Of course the most logical long-term solution would be for
each carrier to charge other carriers the actual cost of
terminating calls.  The FCC said it believes that prices based on
"long-run incremental costs" best reflect the true economic cost of
a service.  However, using internal costs as the basis of access
charging presents difficult practical and administrative issues,
not the least of which would be endless disputes between the
parties on how to measure these costs.

     One possible variation on the bill-and-keep proposal was
suggested by Frontier Corp. (formerly Rochester Telephone Corp.). 
To encourage new competitors to enter the market, it proposed that
the bill-and-keep method apply unless and until the traffic
imbalance exceeded 10%, in which case appropriate payments would be
made to even the score.  Assuming that the proposals in the NPRM
are finally adopted in their present form, CMRS providers would
find their task greatly eased.  

     The access revenue has allowed LECs to keep their rates for
residential and business customers artificially low.  With that
income drying up, presumably the LECs' rates for local service
would have to rise to compensate.  That, in turn, would make the
CMRS carriers' competitive situation more favorable.

     This proceeding is only part of the measures necessary to have
full local exchange competition.  Still to come are the efforts to
work out problems concerning number portability and universal
service.  Nevertheless, it is clear that competition in the local
exchange market will flourish in the next few years, as a result of
pressure on the LECs from both the federal government and state
authorities.  To date, 33 states have removed legal barriers to
local exchange competition, and many of them have implemented bill
and keep as an interim plan.

     In some cases, LECs have proposed more equitable arrangements
than the current one.  For example, NYNEX Corp. and MFS
Communications Co., Inc., a competitive access provider, agreed to
a plan that provides for half-call billing.  Each carrier pays the
other 1.6 cents per minute to terminate most calls.  This is about
half the rate paid by the public.  With bill and keep, costs could
be even lower.

COURT SHOULD CONSIDER MTEL LICENSE SEPARATELY, FCC SAYS

     The FCC has told the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington that
it should not consider the Commission's licensing scheme for
private paging licensees in its deliberations on whether Mobile
Telecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a
license obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"
program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.
94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission's
authority to charge a $33 million fee for the company's narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) license without first
receiving congressional authority (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).

     During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is a licensee
in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newly allocated
frequency band," the agency explained, adding that all other
licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid substantial
sums for their licenses at a government auction.

     The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an advanced
two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge, Mtel did not
apply for a private paging license at 929-930 [megahertz]," it
said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit substantial amounts of
money to its narrowband PCS licenses when private paging licenses
were 'free' undercuts its assertion in this court that the
Commission is applying different rules to identical licenses," the
agency added.

SMR RESALE

     Pittencrieff Communications, Inc., a specialized mobile radio

incumbent licensees.

     In its petition for reconsideration of a recent order in the
Private Radio docket 89-553 proceeding (TRWN, Sept. 21, 1995),
Pittencrieff argued that SMR operators obtaining licenses at
auction will not be able to meet coverage requirements unless they
can enter into such resale agreements.

GLOBAL SATELLITE EXECUTIVES MEET IN PARIS
by Cynthia Boeke

      This September, the world satellite industry's glitterati met in
Paris at the fifth Satel Conseil Symposium to discuss issues facing
the future development of the satellite industry. 
     Among the most talked-about developments were the high rate of
growth in the satellite industry; the development of Ka-band systems
for Internet-related broadband, multimedia applications; growth in the
use of geostationary satellites for mobile telephony services; and the
challenge of orbital slot overcrowding.
     Satel Conseil is a French consortium that provides international
consulting, engineering and technical assistance services in the field
of space communications.

THE FRENCH CONTRIBUTION

      "Growth in the satellite market has exceeded everyone's
expectations," said Francois Fillon, French Cabinet Minister for
Postal Services, Telecommunications and Space. "Everything points to
future growth as well." 
     Fillon noted that low earth orbit (LEO) constellations are
playing a major role in this growth, but that growth in the number of
new geostationary satellites is just as rapid. 
     Three of the world's leading geostationary satellite bus and
payload manufacturers--Matra Marconi Space, Aerospatiale and
Alcatel--are French. "It is vital for France and Europe to preserve
and increase our industrial capability by making sure [French
satellite manufacturers]
have the technology they need," said Fillon. He highlighted the
Stentor program, a partnership between French government and industry,
which will "develop tomorrow's satellite technology--extra capacity
and lifetime."
     Although France is playing a major role in geostationary
satellite manufacturing, Fillon said that "American manufacturers have
taken the initiative in LEO constellations. We must pay tribute to the
American ability to mobilize resources, but we must respond with
second-generation constellations for high data rate exchanges."

THE INTERNET CONNECTION

      Much of the discussion at Satel Conseil centered on the growing
role of the Internet and the potential use of satellites to become a
major Internet delivery vehicle. 
     "Before 2005, the Internet will have exploded," said Serge
Tchuruk, chairman and CEO of Alcatel Alsthom. "It will disintegrate
and be reconfigured." The reason, according to Tchuruk: the Internet
is not business-oriented and is susceptible to technical disruptions.
     "When the Internet is rebuilt," he said, "it will incorporate
broadband multimedia." By that time, he predicted," satellites will be
orbital networks complementing terrestrial networks.
They will be one of the key telecommunications technologies in the
21st century."
     Indeed, one of the systems serving the interactive, broadband
multimedia needs of future users could be Sativod, a constellation of
64 medium earth orbit satellites proposed by Alcatel.
      Sativod is being designed to provide access to the Internet and
online services, remote access to enterprises, telecommuting,
videoconferencing, teleteaching, telemedicine and entertainment
services, said Pascale Sourisse, director of planning and strategy at
Alcatel Espace.
     Sourisse said that there will be 15 million to 20 million
potential Sativod users around the world by the end of the next
decade.
     Future satellite-delivered multimedia services will be driven by
"prosumers," said Karl Savatiel, president of AstroLink at Lockheed
Martin Telecommunications. Prosumers will use the broadband,
interactive satellite services for teleworking and personal use in
their homes or remote offices, he said.
     "Internet backbones are not adequate," said Ronald Maehl, senior
vice president of strategy at Space Systems/Loral. Such a situation,
he said, will provide myriad opportunities for new Ka-band,
satellite-based Internet services, including SS/L's proposed Cyberstar
system.

MOBILE TELEPHONY

      The growing role of geostationary satellites for mobile
telephony applications was underscored at Satel Conseil. 
     According to Michael Williams, vice president of mobile
communications systems at Lockheed Martin Telecommunications,
developing countries are "driving a dramatic increase in demand for
cost-competitive voice services." Lockheed Martin, he continued, can
provide a geostationary satellite-based solution for direct-to-user
mobile telephony with its LMA2100AX high power/dissipation satellite
bus. Its attributes include commercially viable 12- to 15-meter
reflectors; commercially available digital transmission and coding
techniques; and low mass, low power onboard signal processing.
     Meanwhile Inmarsat, for its part, is studying a possible
successor to the new Inmarsat 3 generation of geostationary
satellites, said Warren Grace, director general of Inmarsat. The
potential Inmarsat 4 satellites, he said, might be used to serve new
business markets and provide broadband, broadcast, navigation and
rural communications services. "The chosen solution will probably be
GEO-based," he said, because it allows "less complex user terminals,
reduced network complexity, lower probability of outages and
continuity with existing services." 
     Vladimir Tamarkin, first deputy director of Informcosmos and
director of Russia's Marafon project, provided details of the Marafon
mobile satellite system. Marafon, he said, will comprise five
geostationary Arkos satellites and three or four highly elliptical
orbit Mayak satellites. Initially, services will be provided using a
European satellite. The majority of the system is scheduled to be
operational by 1999.
     The main strategies for Marafon, Tamarkin said, are to attract
advanced foreign technologies to develop the means of space and ground
segments of the system, develop strategic partnerships with foreign
companies, develop partnerships with existing European mobile
satellite service providers, and attract investment for Marafon's
space segment.
     Another geostationary-based system that is looking for partners
is the Euro-African Satellite Telecommunications (EAST) project
proposed by Matra Marconi Space. According to Jean Maury,
director/sales manager for the Civil Communications Satellite
Directorate at Matra Marconi Space, EAST will most likely be based on
two Eurostar 3000 satellites with 12-meter unfurlable reflectors. EAST
would provide mobile telephony services to all of Europe, the Mideast
and parts of Africa. 

ORBITAL SLOT HOARDING

      One of the thorniest issues facing the satellite industry is
orbital slot crowding. "Overfiling is exploding," said Robert Jones,
director of the Radiocommunication Bureau at the ITU. 
     Jones cited two possible solutions to orbital slot crowding:
procedural and financial. The procedural solution, he said, would
involve certification of progress toward the construction and launch
of a satellite by applicants. The financial solution would entail fees
or deposits submitted with each filing, which would be returned when
the satellite is launched. 
      "Orbital slot congestion is worse in the Asia-Pacific than any
other region," emphasized Seon Jong Chung, president of the
Asia-Pacific Satellite Communication Council and vice president of the
Satellite Communications Division of South Korea's ETRI. "Nearly 120
satellite networks have not been processed.
     "Excessive filing for many years complicates limited resources,"
he continued, "and gives burdens to everybody." 
     Despite the regulatory logjam, most conference participants
predicted that the high rate of growth in new satellite systems will
continue. Steven Dorfman, president of Hughes Telecommunications and
Space Co., said he remembered not too long ago, in the 1980s, when the
demise of the satellite industry was predicted because of fiber. "Now
there are four times as many satellites in orbit as there were at the
time of that prediction," he said.
     Dorfman cited new satellite-based consumer applications, higher
power satellites, lower-cost terminals and digital compression as
drivers in satellite growth. "I believe we will continue the
double-digit growth in satellite communications as we have over the
past ten years."
      Cynthia Boeke is the Editor of Via Satellite.

BUSINESS TV APPLICATIONS VIA SATELLITE
by James Careless

      Business television (BTV): finally, the advent of digital video
compression has saved the industry from the drought of analog
satellite space. And with the sudden freedom (and reduced bandwidth)
offered by digital transmission comes a new emphasis: interactive
distance education.
     "Training by satellite has been dramatically increased by new
forms of interactivity," notes Susan Irwin, president of Irwin
Communications and acknowledged BTV "guru." "No longer is it strictly
a one-way medium. Now, with students able to voice questions and file
their responses back to teachers in real time, distance learning has
taken on a whole new power, and a whole new importance."
     To test this theory, Via Satellite surveyed a number of major
U.S. BTV users, to see what they're doing with their BTV networks.

CARRIER CORP.'S "BEAM TV"

      Carrier Corp. is the world's largest maker of air-conditioning,
refrigeration, heating and ventilation equipment. It's products are
distributed in 145 countries worldwide. As a result of this
success, Carrier needs reliable communications to keep its customers
well-served. And that's why the company turned to business TV.
     "Basically our business television network came as a result of
customer demands," says Toni Nevins, Carrier's business development
manager, when asked about the roots of Carrier's Beam TV. "We used to
have two national meetings a year, and our customers--the independent
distributors who sell our equipment--asked us to cut it down to one."
In order to continue to keep customers informed while eliminating the
need for more than one meeting a year, Carrier decided to install its
own business television network.
     "That's where Group W Network Services came in," she adds. "After
we conducted a feasibility study, they helped us install and activate
our network on April 1, 1995, in order to ensure we had another way of
getting important product information out to our customers."
     Known as "Beam TV," Carrier's BTV network supplies at least six
hours of programming a month to 116 sites in the United States and
Canada. The signals are sent out digitally using GI DigiCipher 1
equipment, and received by the sites using 1.2-meter antennas.
     The programs they receive are quite varied, says Nevins. "We do
product introductions, service bulletins, service training, corporate
communications to both employees and customers, and of course, a
monthly half-hour update on the company called `Beam News.'
     "This is scheduled to coincide with the customers' monthly sales
meetings," she continues. "They integrate the news programs into their
meetings to update their employees on Carrier information that they
may need to do their jobs.
     "Most of our broadcasts are live interactive broadcasts," she
adds, "where our customers communicate with the on-air people using a
special  1-800' telephone number."
     This last feature has already proved particularly useful in
keeping Carrier's clients happy, says Nevins. For instance, "we were
doing a major product overhaul that our customers were concerned
about. Once we knew of their concerns, we were able to go to air
within 48 hours with a live phone-in show explaining what we were
doing and why, and fielding their questions as they arose."
     For her part, Nevins is sold on the value of Beam TV. "It has a
strong cost benefit in getting a consistent message out to our
customers," she says, "while offering them to chance to voice their
own concerns. And, not incidentally, it has reduced our travel
expenses as well."

FAA's "TELE-TRAINING"

      With responsibility for critical areas such as air traffic
control and aircraft safety, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
is an agency that relies heavily on training to maintain its
standards. But recent federal budget cutbacks have put the agency in a
real bind, says the FAA's Hank Payne. 
     "From 1992 through 1996 we've seen our training budget cut by 42
percent," Payne notes, "while we've only been able to reduce our
actual training needs by 21 percent."
     Much of the expense of FAA training was the result of residential
training centers, and the travel and per diem costs associated with
sending staff to the sites. That's why in 1993 the FAA turned to AT&T
Tridom to set up its Interactive Video Tele-Training Program, in
a bid to save money while upgrading its staff's expertise.
     Payne manages the Interactive Video Tele-Training Program for the
FAA, one which uses 3.3 MHz of digitally compressed live instructional
video, voice and data fed to 34 receive sites across the country (with
another 26 due to be added soon). 
     The sites themselves are equipped with One Touch student response
keypads, so that both audio and data are relayed back to the
instructor in real time. These keypads are a product offering of One
Touch Systems Inc. of Santa Clara, CA, a supplier of interactive
learning technology. The One Touch system allows students to register
a "call" asking questions of the instructor, and lets them answer
true/false or multiple choice questions as well.
     To date, the FAA has broadcast both specialized (such as
hazardous materials inspection techniques) and general interest (such
as problem-solving) courses to its staff. By doing so, it has
discovered that teaching by satellite actually cuts approximately 25
to 33 percent off course time without any decline in student
performance.
     The reason for this, says Payne, is that residential schools
"keep staff in training eight hours a day because we're paying them
for eight hours a day, despite the fact that people don't learn well
this way. Tele-Training allows employees to get up from their desk, do
two or three hours of learning, and then return to their job--a
strategy that improves their learning ability, and cuts down on the
cost of covering for them while they're in school."

FORD'S FORDSTAR NETWORK

      Ford has been a pioneer in business TV since the early `80s,
when it set up an analog network connecting 200 to 300 of its plants
and parts depots.
     But it was the company's desire to connect all of its 6,000 North
American dealers that led it to establish the Fordstar Network, a $100
million VSAT network built using Hughes Networks Systems' technology.
     The move to Fordstar has sped up data exchange, parts ordering,
and warranty submissions, says Fordstar Manager Lawrence Conley. But
it has also meant that digitally compressed video, with all of its
benefits, has been added to the network. 
     Specifically, "we've got eight channels of full motion video
going out to our dealers," says Conley. These channels feature
distance learning courses for all types of dealer staff. In addition,
the courses are all live and interactive with remote sites using the
One Touch viewer response keypad system to relay student audio and
response data back to the teacher during sessions. 
     To say the least, Fordstar is an impressive commitment to
business television, but one that Ford firmly believes it had to make.
     "We're introducing new models at the rate of one every six weeks
worldwide," says Conley. "These new models have a lot of new
technology and new features, and training our dealer people to keep up
with them is important." BTV allows Ford to achieve such goals.
     In addition, satellite-based distance learning has drastically
reduced training costs, while actually improving the potential level
of expertise at dealer locations. That's because distance is no longer
a barrier to knowledge, thanks to the Fordstar network.

JCPENNEY'S NEW DISTANCE LEARNING NETWORK

      In 1995, retailer JCPenney was faced with a dilemma, namely what
to do with its aging analog business TV network.
     For the past nine years, the company had been running analog
broadcasts showcasing the assortments of merchandise to store managers
so that they could order for their particular stores, according to Ron
Fazio, manager of communications programs and services. However, in
1995 the company realized that sending managers the images on CD-ROM
was much more cost-effective, especially in the light of climbing
satellite costs. In addition, Fazio says the CD-ROMs were much easier
for them to manage.
     Having made the switch to CD-ROM, JCPenney had to look hard at
whether to continue operating an occasional-use analog network, since
the fundamental reason for funding it was now gone.
     However, as one need faded out, a new one came to take its place;
in this instance, the company's desire to start its own distance
learning video network.
     "It's a whole new scenario of programming aimed at saving the
company money and travel and per diems," says Fazio, "by doing all of
our training out of the home office, and relaying it to 1,230 sites
via satellite." For a company such as JCPenney, such training is
crucial, since it operates in a world of expensive high-stakes
promotion and ever-changing consumer tastes. To cope, managers
nationwide must know what to do and when, or face the economic
consequences.
     Functionally, JCPenney is relying on an outbound feed of audio,
video and graphics, and an inbound audio and data feed (from 700 of
the remote sites) from students using the One Touch response keyboard.
It's a configuration that is proving to be extremely popular among
business TV users.
     Of course, the cost of setting up such a network under analog
conditions would have been prohibitive. But thanks to the timely
arrival of digitally compressed video transmission, JCPenney was able
to cut its bandwidth requirements from one full transponder to just a
quarter.
     Driving the whole system--which was designed and installed by GE
Capital Spacenet Services--is Scientific-Atlanta's PowerVu digital
video compression uplink. Capable of compressing up to 10 channels on
a single transponder, PowerVu is both MPEG 2 and DVB compatible,
meaning that the video being delivered is, at the user end, broadcast
quality.
     "Scientific-Atlanta's equipment is the same as that used during
the Olympics," notes Fazio, "which was a real confidence builder for
us."
     Today, JCPenney is producing about 1,200 hours of distance
learning programming a year, says Fazio; that's up radically from the
400 to 500 hours of merchandising video that used to go out on its old
analog network. It indicates just how potent an application distance
learning is for a company such as JCPenney, and how important digital
video compression is to keeping business television alive.

MEDSTAR

      Medstar is a distance learning application with a social
purpose: providing rural and remotely-based physicians in North Dakota
with top-quality interactive distance learning from the School of
Medicine at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks.
     "We typically broadcast one-hour programs related to health
care," says Steve Gillespie, Medstar's coordinator of communications
services, "aimed at all the health care professions that you would
find in a small town, such as physicians, nurses, physical therapists,
and dieticians.
     "Our goal is to help small communities get better access to
things that larger communities take for granted," he adds. "This way
these professions get the continuing health care education they need,
without having to spend time and money traveling to larger centers."
     The Medstar application uses an analog network installed for it
by Satellite Network Systems. Courses are uplinked live from a
production control center at the School of Medicine.
Two cameras are used, along with graphics, which are then sent via
satellite to 35 sites across the state. These sites--usually small
hospitals--are equipped with 1.8-meter antennas, 26-inch monitors,
VCRs, and Harvard Elite audio return units. The Harvard Elite is built
by A.T. Products Inc. of Harvard, IL, a designer and manufacturer of
audioconferencing products. The Elites, which are connected to
microphones, allow students to "talk back" to the instructors via
telephone connections.
     Distance education via business TV has paid off handsomely, says
Gillespie. "Both the school and the communities involved recognize
that Medstar is a worthwhile service," he says.
"It's done very well."

RE/MAX'S NORTH AMERICAN NETWORK

      RE/MAX International Inc. is one of the few real estate
companies that has its own business TV network, says RE/MAX Vice
President of Information Technology Bruce Benham, and it's an edge the
company takes very seriously.
     The RE/MAX Satellite Network is used for a combination of
education, motivation and recruitment. 
     For instance, "we'll have live panels of RE/MAX people talking
about listings presentations," says Benham, "or how they do their
particular business in terms of how they prospect for new customers,
and what kind of materials and techniques they use, and so forth." 
     As well, RE/MAX takes pains to tape motivational speakers at its
conventions for later playback. To ensure good video and sound
quality, the company shoots these features on portable sound stages.
And the company also does live broadcasts where RE/MAX agents field
questions from prospective agents via a 1-800 telephone number.
     Technically speaking, RE/MAX transmits digitally using General
Instrument's SpectrumSaver equipment on a Broadcast
International-designed system, via Telstar 401 using 3.3 MHz of
bandwidth. At the receive end are about 1,200 sites, each equipped
with a 1.2-meter antenna. "They're anywhere from the far reaches of
Canada to the Caribbean," says Benham.
     The CLI equipment is addressable, he adds, "so once a month or
once every other month, we'll do a broadcast that's just sent to
certain parts of the country."
     Does this system work for RE/MAX? Yes, says Benham,
unequivocally: with both management and sales people impressed by the
network's content, "the system sells itself."

STATE FARM'S DISTANCE LEARNING

      State Farm Insurance Companies has recently signed-on its
"Interactive distance Learning Network" (ILN), a digitally-based
voice, audio and data system which keeps agents and employees
up-to-date on both company policies and professional education.
     "We're interested in sending a consistent message to all our
associates at the same time," explains ILN Manager Patsy Fortune. "We
want to get our promotions out in a timely manner, and we want to save
on travel expenses wherever possible."
     State Farm originates its distance learning courses from its
corporate headquarters in Bloomington, IL. Using equipment installed
by Convergent Media Systems, it sends out video, audio and graphics
via Galaxy 7 to students at 33 sites nationwide. It receives questions
via the One Touch keypad system.
     Although live, the classes offered by State Farm are anything but
off-the-cuff. 
     "It's all rehearsed and choreographed," says Fortune. In fact,
for every hour broadcast, State Farm requires four to eight hours of
rehearsal. As well, the company offers a workshop for instructors, so
that they can get a sense of how different distance education is from
conventional in-class teaching.
     "We work with the instructors to make sure the material they're
presenting is interactive, that it invites student participation,"
says Fortune. "After all, if you're just going to have a talking head,
you might as well just send out a tape."
     Although only officially launched on August 1, 1996, ILN is
already proving to be a big hit with both management and salespeople.
     "We're definitely getting a very, very positive reception from
the people taking the classes," says Fortune. "They see it as a
time-saver and a money-saver."
     As the examples we've just seen prove, business TV is not only
surviving the spectrum crunch, it's thriving, thanks to digital video
compression. However, it's also clear that another reason for its
continued health is its ability to branch out from traditional
videoconferencing to a host of new uses. 
     One thing appears certain: as technology progresses, so will the
size and scope of business TV.

BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--WHY SATELLITE DISTANCE LEARNING IS BOTH THRIVING
AND MERELY SURVIVING

by Britton Manasco
      The satellite distance learning industry is both expanding and
contracting at the same time.
The industry stands between two worlds--one vibrant and promising, one
trapped in political gridlock. 
     While the business world has embraced space-based tele-learning
technology and is investing the financial resources necessary to
create expansive new networks, the world of education faces cost and
structural issues that are preventing the rapid spread of
satellite-based learning networks. Satellite executives deserve a
clear-eyed assessment of this complex market.   

THE WORLD OF BUSINESS  

      For the immediate future, the real action in the distance
learning market is likely to revolve around the adult consumer who
wishes to upgrade his or her own skills and knowledge.
American companies now spend perhaps $100 billion on training and
education (not counting on-the-job training). Adults spend another
$200 billion to $300 billion on education at colleges, universities
and other institutions. Therefore, figures can be expected to grow as
learning becomes a lifelong pursuit. What will not expand, however, is
the individuals' available time.
That amount is fixed and the premium on it is rising precipitously.    
     Service providers who meet the individual's need to learn quickly
and conveniently can expect to reap tremendous rewards in the years to
come. Indeed, much of the funding now spent on instructural led,
classroom education is likely to shift to high-tech learning services
to meet consumer demands. Satellite-based learning services are
particularly attractive in this regard, especially if they can be
delivered direct-to-home or to the work-site. 
     Satellite services can transcend the geographical boundaries and
limits that constrain traditional education. They make a vast array of
learning opportunities available--no matter where you are. "Whether
the market is intra-enterprise or from universities to the enterprise,
we see exploding growth," says Joan Byrnes, marketing, sales and new
business development director for AT&T Skynet. (Editor's Note: As we
went to press, AT&T Skynet was purchased by Loral. When the deal is
finalized, the company will become Loral Skynet.)
     One organization that is successfully taking advantage of this
opportunity is National Technological University (NTU). Based in Fort
Collins, CO, NTU transmits advanced technical and managerial
telecourses via satellite to high-profile companies such as General
Electric, Intel, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments.
NTU's interactive programs--enabling participants to communicate with
instructors by phone, fax or e-mail--have become a critical aspect of
corporate efforts to encourage continual learning. 
     In the past decade, the number of NTU customer organizations has
risen from five to 207, the number of downlink sites has grown 16 to
993 and the number of non-credit short course enrollments (which
target people who need to strengthen or develop a special skill) has
climbed from zero to 100,000 annually. In addition, the number of
participating universities who provide content and other resources has
reached 46. NTU now has roughly 4,400 graduate course enrollments and
offers 13 master degree programs.   
     The growth has been spectacular. NTU has been able to offer an
array of educational programming to meet the growing needs of the
adult learning marketplace. NTU accomplished this in a cost-effective
way. It digitally compresses its signals at ratios of as high as 12:1
and sends them all over North America via AT&T's Telstar 401
satellite. 
     NTU's success, however, is a sign of change in the unfolding
information era. It reflects the ascendance of technical professionals
in the modern organization. Consider the numbers. In the last four
decades, the number of technical workers in America has risen 300
percent--or three times the growth rate of the overall workforce--to
20 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington,
DC. It is a segment of the workforce that is on the front lines of
organizational and technological change. 
     If technical professionals are to be effective, however, they
must continually learn new skills and competencies. "Technological
creativity today is strongly related to advanced education," says NTU
founder Lionel Baldwin. 
     Similarly, there has been significant growth in company-specific,
satellite learning networks. Some estimates suggest that there are
roughly 120 networks of this kind and more than 50,000 satellite
downlinks in North America alone. Ford Motor, for instance, has
developed a digital system (dubbed "Fordstar") that beams management,
technical and customer service-oriented telecourses to more than 6,000
dealerships. Ford executives estimate that the network will
dramatically reduce training costs that the organization absorbs each
year while expanding the number of training options. In a competitive
arena such as the automotive business, such dramatic moves can be
cost-justified and acted upon. Other companies such as K-Mart, Federal
Express and RE/MAX International have also devoted significant
resources to the development of satellite-based learning networks.
RE/MAX, for instance, is a real estate firm that transmits an array of
telecourses to 1,200 sites throughout North America and has a
potential viewing audience of 23,000 sales agents. K-Mart sends
managerial programming to 2,500 sites. And Federal Express reaches
1,000 satellite dishes. All are focused on enhancing the capabilities
of their employees while eliminating expensive classroom training (and
the travel and lodging it requires). It's unlikely that these
companies would be making such tremendous investments if they weren't
all in such highly competitive businesses. The market imperative is
clear.  
     Even the competitive higher education system is responding to
changing market demands. One of the most experienced distance learning
providers is Oklahoma State University, which operates a tele-learning
program. It transmits telecourses to students and companies throughout
the country from its base in Stillwater, OK, and has attracted
corporate clients such as Phillips Petroleum, Conoco Inc. and Seagate
Technologies.   
     On the West Coast, the California State University (CSU) system
is also reaching out via satellite. Its programs in political science,
social science and business administration, among others, are now
transmitted via Hughes Communications' Ku-band SBS 5 satellite
throughout the state of California and the rest of the country. CSUSat
uses digital compression to send two channels of video programming to
seven campuses and more than 30 receive sites. 
     "Distance learning is one way we can meet the challenge of the
coming enrollment boom," says Molly Corbett Broad, CSU executive vice
chancellor. "We don't have the physical facilities here or throughout
the system to cope with anticipated increases, but with distance
learning we can still expand access to the university. It is all part
of our strategic plan to bring CSU to the students, while enhancing
academic quality and improving productivity."  

THE WORLD OF EDUCATION 

      In the world of K-12 education, the picture is far less
attractive. "On the downside, I am a little discouraged that we have
not seen more innovation from an instructional standpoint," says
Sandra Welch, executive vice president of learning services for PBS.
"A few years ago, there was a great deal of creativity. Organizations
were creating advanced courses and we were connecting people together.
There hasn't been that kind of innovation in the last three to four
years."   She notes that the education sector is going through a
period when a lot of new technological capabilities--including
videoconferencing and the World Wide Web--are becoming available to
schools. "Schools want to experiment," she says.   
    Whereas satellite distance learning programs were offered on more
than 20 satellites a few years ago, there has been much consolidation
and abandonment of the market in the years since. Price-sensitive
educational entities have been unable to absorb stiff rate increases
for spot use. C-band rates have climbed to between $575 and $725 per
hour; Ku-band prices now range from $750 to $1,000. Grace Leone,
president of EFC Startime, a Los Angeles-based reseller of satellite
time, says that the percentage of her business devoted to distance
learning programming has shrunk from roughly 50 percent a few years
ago to about 15 percent today.  
     "What really was a vibrant, growing field in the education
industry has come to, if not a full halt, a slow pace," adds Shelly
Weinstein, president and CEO of Washington, DC-based NETO-EDSAT, a
non-profit organization representing educational institutions that
employ information technologies to deliver their products and
services.  
     Some educational leaders have publicly accused satellite
executives of greedily price gouging them. Satellite operators,
however, point out that space segment supply has shrunk in recent
years due to growing commercial demand for capacity and a limited
number of successful new launches over North America.
     The larger problem is the inability of government-run,
educational institutions to invest the money necessary to become
viable customers of satellite services. As a result, much of the new
activity in education is sponsored by states rather than school
districts or individual schools.
Satellite networks are now being funded by such states as Georgia,
Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida--all of which are part of the
"educational neighborhood" on Telstar 401 (which also includes NTU,
SERC and PBS). 
     The Florida Department of Education, for instance, expects to
make programming available to some 3,000 public school, according to
AT&T. But it's unclear what impact such broadly defined, "community"
networks can have. They often carry government and public service
messages of various sorts. They also tend to fill educational gaps in
such areas as the sciences, mathematics and foreign languages for the
most poorly served student rather than expand choices for the typical
student.
     Satellite-based education is at its best when it transports
students to distant places and generates enthusiasm for learning.
Glenn Kessler, director of legislative affairs and affiliate relations
issues at the United States Distance Learning Association, points out
that satellite-based, electronic field trips have enabled children
around the country to interactively participate in Civil War
reenactments, archaeological digs in South America, underwater
exploration efforts in several oceans and visit some of the greatest
museums on the planet. 
     Organizations such as PBS and Turner Educational Services have
been active developers of such programming. Welch mentions PBS's
recent and upcoming electronic field trips to the Costa Rican
rainforests, Ellis Island and the United Nations. Such efforts are
creating a demand among young people for better and more engaging
learning services. "Once the communication system is in place, you can
see what is possible and you are going to want it," says Kessler. And
while economic and political hurdles are the primary ones preventing
K-12 education from becoming a dynamic market for satellite services,
technical hurdles are not to be discounted. John Champagne, director
of broadcast products for network equipment provider Comsat RSI, notes
that many educators have been stymied by the question of
digitalization. In some cases, the costs of the transition from analog
to digital is deemed prohibitive. However, other institutions are
struggling to choose from a field of largely incompatible compression
technologies--whether they be provided by Scientific-Atlanta, General
Instrument, Comsat/Wegener or some other vendor. 
     Comsat RSI has created networks for Channel One (10,000 nodes),
Kentucky Educational Television (2,000 nodes) and, despite the
economic and technical challenges of potential customers, experienced
growth of between 50 to 60 percent last year. "The big thing is that
everyone will have to go digital eventually," Champagne says.   
     Of course, most of the near-term opportunities are likely to be
in business markets and, possibly, among agencies in the federal
government. The downsizing of government, presaged by the end of the
Cold War and the rise of the federal debt, has proved a surprising
opportunity for providers of distance learning capabilities. Jolly
Holden, executive marketing manager for distance learning at AT&T
Tridom, explains that the federal government's satellite training and
education network (GETN) is expected to grow from 900 downlink sites
in 1995 to 1,800 by the end of 1997 and 3,000 by the end of 1998.
Between now and then the number of telecourse hours will triple from
roughly 4,000 to about 12,000.  The network spans an array of civilian
and military agencies--everything from the Department of Energy to the
Department of Defense.

THE YEARS TO COME  

      In the years to come, satellite equipment and service providers
can be expected to focus on creating end-to-end solutions that
eliminate many of the risks and capital-investments that distance
learning customers are now forced to assume. Indeed, some companies
are beginning to introduce packages that enable organizations with
expansive networks of satellite downlinks to pay monthly service fees
and lease the equipment. As arrangements such as this become more
common, more companies and organizations--private sector and
public--will be willing to implement distance learning programs.   
     Still another promising development is the emergence of the
direct broadcast satellite business. While DBS players have for the
most part resisted calls for an "open architecture" consortium that
enables consumers to point their satellite dishes at multiple orbital
locations (see Via Satellite's June 1996 issue, "Open Architecture
DBS"), this would be an essential step if true narrowcast programming
is ever to be offered direct-to-home. This may ultimately be one
important route by which educational and learning service providers
cost-effectively reach diverse and targeted markets.
     One other route, of course, is the Internet. Satellite-based
content providers will have to incorporate dynamic, interactive,
online services into their program offerings in the years ahead if
they wish to succeed. It is no longer enough to merely transmit static
programming, especially if the objective is learning. The era of MTV
is effectively over. This is an era of multiple, reinforcing media.    
     One trend that bodes favorably for the future of distance
learning is the rise of business as a purveyor of educational
services. Stan Davis, Harvard lecturer and author of The Monster Under
the Bed (Touchstone), argues that the government school system will
become a relatively less important force in education than the
training and continual learning that occurs in the business world
during the individual's working lifetime. Due to both demographic and
economic trends, he argues, education will no longer be merely
"front-ended" in the two initial decades of a person's life. It will
at last be recognized as a lifelong pursuit. That suggests that the
market for learning is increasingly swinging toward adults with
working experience. Already, more than half of the people paying for
the services of colleges and universities are older than 25 years of
age and have entered the workforce, according Educom, a nonprofit
organization in Washington, DC that tracks higher educational trends
in the United States.
     Satellite distance learning is thriving in the open market of
business and merely surviving in the market of education. But the
smart money knows that the learning market, as a whole, represents a
tremendous economic opportunity. Satellites will unquestionably assume
a vital role in the infrastructure of the emerging knowledge economy.
Still, it's important to make distinctions and recognize that some
segments are more promising--at least, in the short term--than others.
For those who invest wisely, the learning market may turn out to be
one of the greatest business frontiers of the next century.

SATELLITE SITES ON THE WEB
by Gerald E. Oberst, Jr.

      Increasingly, the satellite industry is accessing the vast store
of information that is on the Internet, free or nearly so for the
taking. The Net can be a strong resource for regulatory or general
industry research, if you have time to play with the many different
sites that are available.
     A few practical warnings at the outset: you can spend an entire
lifetime sorting and sifting through the virtual maze of Internet
sites. Thus, surfers generally maintain a library of bookmarks for the
best or most-used sites. Some favorites are maintained by the Analysys
consulting firm in Cambridge, U.K., and the University of Michigan. 
     The "Regulator" page on the Analysys server includes links to
numerous regulatory agencies and many other topics within the domain
of telecommunications. The Michigan site is succinctly named "Telecom
Information Resources on the Internet." It is supported by the
Michigan Schools of Information and of Public Policy Studies, and
claims to provide links to over 2,000 sites. Another useful site is
"Diane's List" maintained at the U.S. National Telecommunications and
Information Administration. 
     A little Net secret is that many documents pulled up are in
formats that do not translate well into hard copy. This is a problem
if you need to download and maintain the original document. Reprinting
Internet documents, particularly those with built-in links to other
Internet documents, often requires reformatting the original. The end
result can either be difficult to read, messy, or starkly different
from the original in format and pagination. (Hint, use the "replace"
word processing function a lot to eliminate those pesky HTML codes and
useless paragraph marks.)
     Those caveats aside, the Net is a startling gold mine of
information. There are few laws or government regulations on Web
sites, the Canadian and U.S. telecoms laws being notable exceptions.
However, a large number of regulatory agencies now maintain Web sites
that can be useful for anyone working in the international arena.
     Two sites on which to focus are maintained by the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission and the International Telecommunication
Union. 
     The FCC site is a basic bookmark for the satellite researcher, of
course, since it is a quick source of recent FCC documents. You cannot
rely on it for older documents (go to the pay online databanks for
that). But for anyone outside Washington, DC, who does not obtain
hard-copy FCC documents regularly, the fcc.gov site is a great
resource.
     The Internet is now the primary source for updates on the FCC
working groups that are preparing for the World Radio Conferences
(WRCs). The FCC decided to stop preparing lengthy notices of proposed
rulemaking or notices of inquiry on WRC issues, but instead to publish
regular agendas, minutes and schedules for the various WRC working
groups. To follow the working group agendas and summaries, go to the
WRC-97 site within the International Bureau.
The International Bureau is the location for most satellite-related
items, so this is a site to "bookmark."
     The ITU maintains a treasure trove of information, but as with
most treasure hunts, there can be frustrating deadends. Some of the
most enticing documents might be available only for a fee, or to ITU
Members, or participating member companies that have passwords. Even
so, quite a few documents on current debates concerning, for example,
"paper satellites" can be found under the search term "Resolution 18"
on the function within the ITU site. The background on regulatory or
policy forums can be pulled off the Web as well.
     Even if certain documents are password protected, sometimes you
can find the same document freely available at another site within the
labyrinth of ITU levels. Unfortunately, you will not be able to access
ITU recommendations that way, since the agency wants to preserve its
ability to earn substantial revenues from selling these and other
documents to the paying public.
     One advantage of most ITU documents available on the Web is that
they suffer from fewer formatting problems than many others. ITU
documents can usually be downloaded and reprinted with little or no
reformatting. The same cannot be said for many European Commission
documents, even in the telecommunications and Information Society
area, which can suffer from messy formats.
     Want to follow the World Trade Organization telecommunications
trade talks that are reviewing how to liberalize international
satellite services? Look at the U.S. Trade Representative site. Want
to know about NASA? One of the many available places to look is the
Spacelink site. Want to keep track of satellites in orbit? There's the
site to follow site.
These sites scratch the surface of available resources, and more are
becoming available every day.

A DECADE IN VIDEOTEX COMMUNICATIONS

      With the decade of the 1980s behind us and the dawn of the
1990s on the horizon, the videotex industry is positioned for a
new beginning.  As we look back on an industry that was born 10
years ago, we see that despite a slow start, the concept of
residential electronic messaging services is beginning to come
into vogue.
      To the videotex industry, the 1980s have in many ways been a
paradox--a decade perhaps epitomized best by the old literary
line "it was the best of times--it was the worst of times."
      For those of us who now look back over the past 10 years in
the information services arena to determine the common thread
that ties together the events of that decade, the only constant
appears to have been change.
      As a fitting beginning to the decade of the 1990s, VIEWTEXT
is taking a look back on the major events, visions, and changes
of the past decade and the past year that have brought us to this
point in our industry's history.

Challenges and opportunities

      Riding the sweeping tide of the Information Age, the
consumer videotex industry was born amid much fanfare in 1981.
By the end of the 1980s, some advocates claimed at the time,
every home in America would access information services--
including news and banking--from a terminal in their living room.
As we enter the 1990s, that vision is still far from reality.
      Even by the time of the Videotex '82 conference in July of
that year, the reality of the mammoth challenge of deployment had
become apparent.
      While a number of videotex trials (Time Inc., Knight-
Ridder/AT&T, and Times Mirror) were already under way, questions
on divergent standards, consumer demand, and the service's
relationship to existing media were already being raised.
      These factors, and an insufficient residential terminal
base, had closed the book on those early trials by the late
1980s.  In the last 2 years, however, a proliferation of personal
computers in the home and RBOC gateway involvement has
resurrected the videotex concept.
      One nationwide service, the IBM/Sears joint venture Prodigy,
as well as regional services operated by Southwestern Bell and
BellSouth, Nynex, Bell Atlantic and U S West appear to be gaining
steam and may give American living rooms an intelligent window on
the world in the 1990s.
      Other developments, including ISDN and RBOC installations of
fiber-to-the-home, could also give the industry the push it needs
to realize the vision in this decade.

A new telecommunications infrastructure

      Perhaps the one event that has had the most significant
impact on the  communications marketplace is the 1982 antitrust
settlement that broke up AT&T's telecommunications empire.
      So significant were the events of that time, that the
ripples have not only been felt throughout the 1980s, but
repercussions will likely continue throughout the remainder of
the 20th century.  The AT&T-Justice Department Settlement
Agreement, signed Jan. 8, 1982, by the 2 parties, replaced the
1956 consent decree that had ended a 1949 antitrust action.
      Under the terms of that agreement, AT&T divested its 22 Bell
operating companies (BOCs), which then were required to function
as separate entities independent of AT&T.
      The BOCs, which were grouped into 7 regional holding
companies (RBOCs), retained the local exchange and exchange
access services, but were banned from engaging in manufacturing,
interexchange services, information services, or "any other
product or service, except exchange telecommunications and
exchange access service, that is not a natural monopoly service
actually regulated by tariff."
      For the first time, alternative interexchange carriers such
as MCI would be able to compete on a level playing field.  For
the price of divestiture,  AT&T retained its interexchange
business and all constraints on its dabbling in technology were
lifted--enabling AT&T to realize its dreams of moving into the
computer business.  It was, however, barred from engaging in
electronic publishing services until last year.
      When U.S. District Judge Harold Greene OK'd AT&T's bid to
enter the electronic publishing business last August, he may have
opened the door allowing the long-distance giant to offer content
in a cross-country videotex and audiotext network should it so
decide.
      In addition to freeing AT&T to provide videotex and
audiotext, the decision theoretically will also permit AT&T to
provide electronic messaging services, including E-mail,
nationally via the same transmission facility.
      Greene's decision reversed a clause in the modified final
judgment (MFJ) that for the last 7 years has blocked AT&T from
engaging in the electronic publishing business.  When the MFJ was
issued, the court reasoned that the prohibition was necessary
both because of AT&T's "de facto control of the interexchange
network, coupled with the infancy of the electronic publishing
industry" at that time.
      Greene, who also signed the order that dissected Ma Bell's
empire, would continue to play a critical role in the evolution
of the new telecommunications order throughout the remainder of
the decade.  On March 7, 1988, Greene issued a 66-page order
reversing some of the provisions of the (MFJ).
      That original order permitted the RBOCs to engage in the
transmission of information as part of a gateway to an
information service, but not in the generation or manipulation of
information content.
      Other concessions made to the RBOCs in that order included
the ability to provide electronic mail, voice storage and
retrieval, voice messaging services, and kiosk billing.
      This resulted in the entry of the RBOCs into the electronic
messaging arena in a big way.  Today, most of the RBOCs offer
gateway services and many offer electronic mail services to a
rapidly growing base of corporate clients.
      At the dawn of the 1990s, support continues to build for so-
called "free the RBOCs" proposals, and faced with the need to
address critical issues of global competitiveness and customer
service, the RBOCs appear destined for regulatory relief in the
first half of the new decade.
      Last year was a year of heavy activity for the RBOCs as they
began to stake a claim in the information services marketplace.
The Information Age officially arrived in the Omaha, Neb./Council
Bluffs, Iowa, area in November 1989, when the U S West Community
Link Gateway went on line.
      U S West joined fellow RBOCs BellSouth (the first to enter
this field), Southwestern Bell, Nynex, and Bell Atlantic in the
videotex gateway services market.  By year's end, only Pacific
Bell and Ameritech were still lacking an on-line gateway by which
their customers can gain access to electronic information and
messaging services.

January, 1990

Pacific Bell bows out of the videotex arena

      West Coast information service providers were dealt a severe
blow in November, when Pacific Bell abruptly cancelled its
California Online gateway project, apparently a victim of
Chairman Ginn's budget axe.  This most recent setback for the
videotex industry is reminiscent of Pacific Bell's ill-fated
Project Victoria, an ISDN trial dismantled in the spring of 1988
(VT, June 1988, p. 2).
      Roger Conrad, director of voice information and gateway
services for Pacific Bell, told VIEWTEXT, "We are deferring at
this point."

Customer needs; commercial viability

      At the time, Conrad said, "Products that we are currently
being allowed to introduce into the marketplace will not satisfy
or meet our customers' needs.  Therefore, we have concluded that
it will not be commercially viable for Pacific Bell or the
information providers that would be involved in the trial."
      Pacific Bell disassembled its estimated $1-2 million gateway
project with its 8-10 employees and re-allocated the resources to
its other projects such as voice mail, X.400, and the interactive
voice response service bureau for 976 and 900 providers.

California On-Line trial was scheduled for 1990

      The FCC had conditionally approved Pacific Bell's Comparably
Efficient Interconnection (CEI) plan to offer a videotex gateway
service, "California Online," scheduled for a market trial in the
San Francisco Bay area during the second quarter of 1990.
      Quantum Computer was to develop a user interface for the
gateway, and Vicorp Interactive System to implement the
information storage facility using a Tandem NonStop computer
system.
      Conrad laid the blame on a lack of maturity of the videotex
market which is due to insufficient PC penetration (despite a Bay
Area ubiquity of PCs that ranks among the highest in the nation),
little general public awareness, and not enough on-line
information services out there for companies.
      The project is being "put on hold" until there is
significant market development or deregulation occurs.
Deregulation is considered a very critical factor.  Although
Conrad asserted that competition with IBM/Sears joint venture
Prodigy was not part of the considerations, he did say that
Prodigy has not had the restrictions placed on it that the RBOCs
have had to endure, such as offering preferred access to some
customers, providing their own services or centralizing
operations between LATAs.
      Most of the other RBOCs appear to have acknowledged that
they must commit to the videotex market without expecting profits
in the foreseeable future.  Pacific Bell chose not to wait out
the storm under the conditions that exist today in the regulated
marketplace.

Up-to-date in Omaha with U S West

      U S West customers officially entered the information age in
November when the Community Link trial began in the Omaha, Neb.,
and Council Bluffs, Iowa, (the 2 cities are separated by a river)
metropolitan area.  U S West's marketing communications manager
Ron Dulle said that the RBOC initially targeted 70,000 customers
through a direct-mail campaign.
      Approximately 40 percent of the services on their Community
Link gateway have local applications, including grocery ordering
and delivery, municipal government, local sports, symphony,
community calendar, advertising, and so on.          By year's end, U S
West had 64 contracts with information service providers (ISPs),
Dulle told us, with more being added every week.  Because each
ISP can provide more than one service, the total number of online
services approaches the 150-175 range.
      Customers access the service through modem-equipped personal
computers or through a dumb terminal that can be either rented or
purchased from U S West.  A Community Link Center retail store
will be opened in an Omaha shopping mall, where customers can
obtain the communications devices and software necessary to
access the service.
      Philips Minitel M2 terminals, which support both Teletel and
ASCII formats, can be rented for $7.95 a month, or be purchased
for $295.  Two months free rental or a $50 dollar discount plus
free software were being offered as an introductory inducement to
start up the service.
      Emulation software from Minitel is available for IBM, Apple
II, Macintosh and Commodore, and will be available under the
Community Link label.

Bell Atlantic introduced gateways in Washington and Philadelphia

      In January of 1989, Bell Atlantic kicked off 2 gateway
trials on the East Coast.  Bell of Pennsylvania is targeting
small businesses in the Philadelphia area, while C&P Telephone is
focusing on residential customers in the Washington, D.C., metro
area.  To date, the RBOC has not attracted tremendous numbers of
users.
      The trial will continue in 1990 with more emphasis devoted
to aggressively marketing the service.   Bell Atlantic first
concentrated on enhancing its gateway service by adding 3 new
information providers (IPs) to its gateway trial (VT, May 1989,
p. 3).  Dialcom, American CitiNet Inc. and Minitel USA Inc.
together are providing more than 90 new services to the
Washington Metropolitan area adding electronic mail, tax
information, and travel information.           CitiNet's 47 services
cover a broad spectrum, from an E-mail service, American CitiNet
Mail, weekends on the road, to cultural events up in the New
England area.
      Minitel Services was providing access to an extensive array
of French and English language services by the fourth or fifth of
August, said Joseph Mazzeo, Minitel Services president.  Mazzeo
spoke of a unique French cooking class in English allowing users
to "look in the refrigerator for ingredients" and a Euro-based
database of information by the European Economic Community (EEC).
      Howard Morrison, product manager for Bell Atlantic services,
told us,  "What we learn this year will determine how we roll
this service out to other service areas.  We're looking to expand
already."
      The total number of online services reached 112 this fall,
and included a strong local orientation.  Some of the more recent
offerings include California Wine Online, GEnie, Journal
Graphics, Trademark Register, and a Washington Dating Service.
Bell Atlantic also offers an electronic messaging service that is
provided through the SprintMail (formerly Telemail) network.
      Bell Atlantic's Gateway Service is available to all
Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone residential and business
customers in the Washington metropolitan area on a 24-hour basis
via a modem and a personal computer.
      Bell Atlantic also included Prodigy's videotex services in a
residential trial of integrated services digital network (ISDN)
last summer.  This was the first inclusion on Prodigy in an ISDN
trial since the AT&T ISDN demonstration at NetPower '89.
      Prodigy's computer-based information and electronic shopping
service as well as Bell Atlantic's gateway service was offered
free of charge for the residential trial.  The advantage of using
Prodigy or Bell Atlantic's Gateway service with ISDN is the
access through a plug in a wall vs. the need for a modem, and not
tying up a voice line.
      In December, addressing a gathering of communications
managers, Bell Atlantic CEO Raymond W. Smith blasted a decision
by Judge Greene regarding intra-LATA gateways, the effect of
which requires the RBOCs to maintain separate databases in each
local access transport area (LATA) for its electronic information
gateways (See related story, p. 11).
      The Bell Atlantic CEO said the decision hurts his firm's
gateway by "raising costs considerably, and is an inefficient way
to provide information services to the public."  Smith would also
like to see an end to the restrictions on providing information
content imposed by the MFJ under the administration of Judge
Greene.

Southwestern Bell follows French example for SourceLine

      Southwestern Bell launched an ambitious gateway trial this
past year in the Houston area.  SW Bell was the first RBOC to
apply the French "Minitel" strategy by seeding the market with
12,000 terminals offered free for the first 6 months.
      The Southwestern RBOC has been working closely with U.S.
Videotel, for the provision of both terminals and services in
what sales manager Guy Miller called "the largest, most ambitious
mass market gateway trial attempted by an RBOC."  By the end of
the summer, over 15,000 customers had come aboard as on-line
subscribers, with over 10,000 of them using the "dumb" terminals.
      Southwestern Bell also went after the small businesses in
the Houston area by offering "a couple of thousand" free U.S.
Videotel minitels, said Scott Hilgeman from SW Bell.
      Offering the terminals to a small business will provide an
information retrieval base that will not tie up a computer
already committed to a specific project or person.  For small
offices that do not usually have computers to spare, this could
be an added bonus.
      Southwestern Bell expects its legislative news, group
organization information, dining locations, electronic mail,
financial news, and travel information along with the 300 other
services to attract the small businesses to its service in the
greater Houston area.

BellSouth first to videotex through unregulated subsidiary

      BellSouth's unregulated subsidiary, BellSouth Enterprises,
is zeroing in on the Atlanta marketplace with the Transtext
Universal Gateway (TUG) by using local services as a competitive
edge.  The project was begun in 1988 and the RBOC reports "good
success" with the project thus far.
      By the end of October 1989, TUG had over 50 ISPs on-line
which translates into many more services.  Customers are being
provided with what BellSouth refers to as "useful and attractive
information," such as the Alliance Theatre Co., Ask-a-Vet, chat
lines, newspapers, Grolier Encyclopedia as well as access to
Dialcom and Delphi.
      Although BellSouth was the first RBOC to introduce its
gateway at the end of August 1988, the RBOC still considers the
service new, is working on feedback, and considers itself to have
a "ubiquity that cannot be denied" in the marketplace.

Nynex introduces Info-Look gateway

      Info-Look, the public network gateway service introduced by
New York Telephone last year, offers residential and business
customers access to a wide range of information, educational,
shop-at-home services via the use of a PC or terminal, modem and
communications software, and a New York Telephone Calling Card.
      "Info-Look service dramatically changes the way people
access and use information," Walter Richard, vice president of
marketing and technology at New York Telephone, boasted.
      "For the first time, our customers can reach and interact
with a variety of services quickly and easily from their home or
office."  Over 60 services are offered to customers in the
greater New York metropolitan area, Long Island, and Westchester,
Putnam and Rockland counties.
      Charges for New York Tel's new service include the cost of
the telephone call to the gateway, plus 5 cents a minute for the
time spent to review the directory, plus the specific rates set
by the information provider (IP) for their individual services.
      Charges for Info-Look may appear separately on the New York
Telephone bill under "Data Services," or the IPs also have the
option to bill customers directly.
      Customers can block access to various services, or price
specific services by following directions on the directory.  All
access to Info-Look can be blocked, at no charge, by calling New
York Tel's business office.
      Nynex first offered the Info-Look service in Vermont,
through New England Telephone, in December of 1988.  The Vermont
gateway is serving customers throughout the state with about 100
information and consumer services.

Canadian videotex activity on the rise

     Having conquered Montreal on a market trial basis, Alex--
Bell Canada's videotex service will move on to Toronto in April
1990 with its information service.
      The company is rolling out in Toronto almost a year ahead of
schedule because of what it calls "customer interest in the
service, market demand, and the growth of the videotex support
industry."
      Last May, the videotex service had attracted almost 13,000
Montreal subscribers, and was predicting 20,000 subscribers by
the summer.
      U.S. Videotel will begin providing 50 services to Alex by
the middle of next year.  In addition to the Texas-based service
provider, La Redoute--a subsidiary of Sears Canada, Consumers
Distributing, National Pagette and Hertz Rent-A-Car have recently
signed on with Alex.

PRODIGY GROWS BY 450 PERCENT, APPROACHES 200,000 HOUSEHOLDS

     Since its launch when the service began with 35,000
households, Prodigy has attracted nearly 200,000 households, for
a total of 315,000 users, as of Dec. 31, 1989.  That translates
to a 450 percent rate of growth over the past year.
      According to President Theodore Papes, Prodigy has more than
doubled the number of member households since it entered the New
York market last spring, when membership stood at 50,000
households.
      Sources say that Sears and IBM have spent more than $700
million on Prodigy thus far, and they still have a way to go
before the service begins to run in the black.
      Prodigy has recently begun packaging its software with a
Hayes Personal Modem which is available in either a 1200 or 2400
baud version.  Although the modem is not fully functional (users
cannot dial in), the package is an attractive "turn-key" system
that provides everything a properly equipped personal computer
owner needs to get on line within 15 to 20 minutes after opening
the box.
      As it stands, the packaging of the software/modem
combination appears to have made Prodigy an appealing Christmas
gift, something the marketers no doubt anticipated, and the
service made a major sales push during the holiday season.
      Nynex, whose electronic gateway for information services
competes with Prodigy, is the first of the RBOCs to enter into a
business relationship with
the Sears/IBM-owned information service provider.
      Prodigy has negotiated bundling relationships with different
companies to enlarge its public profile.
      As far as the banking side is concerned, Prodigy has signed
an exclusive contract with Wells Fargo Bank which prohibits other
California financial institutions through 1990 from offering the
home banking service.

A growth year

      Earlier last year, Prodigy made a big splash entering new
markets in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Chicago,
and the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.
      The Twin City area of 115,0001 homes with personal computers
will also be serviced by Super Valu, a large grocery store chain.
      The Chicago area had on line 375,000 homes with personal
computers and will have NBD, Illinois banks to offer electronic
home banking on the Prodigy service.
      When Prodigy launched its new service in Chicago, it
announced it was in 85,000 households and that figure represented
2.3 persons per household using the service.
      While Prodigy's reach into the consumer marketplace in 1989
was significantly extended, it experienced a few minor setbacks.
Citizens and Southern National (C&S) of Atlanta discontinued its
home banking service, (HomEc) offered via Prodigy on Sept. 15.
      Although C&S gained nearly 50 customers a week since the
service was introduced in October 1988, Bill Van Landingham,
president of C&S in Georgia, said business priorities had been
reviewed and the bank had decided to "allocate resources now
committed to the HomEc program to other activities."
       C&S was servicing 1,100 accounts or households, Scott
Scredon, a bank spokesman, said.  Prodigy said it had 1,500
accounts, but Scredon explained that included couples using the
same account.
      VIEWTEXT learned in late July that C&S was reevaluating its
banking service with Prodigy.  Prodigy officials we contacted at
that time were not aware of the event.

Battle lines drawn in Houston

      Prodigy moved into the Houston area last year the same way
it has moved into all of its areas across the United States.  The
only difference in Houston is that Southwestern Bell Telephone
(SWBT), along with U.S. Videotel, had already staked their claim
to the greater Houston area (VT, April 1989, p. 2).
      In addition to moves into Texas, Prodigy Services Co. has
moved into Denver and Miami.  More than 125,000 homes in the
Denver area and another 140,000 homes in the Miami area with PCs
now have access to Prodigy services.  Prodigy distributed its
free start-up kits in both areas to seed the market and will, of
course, charge $49.95 for the kit after the promotion is
finished.
      The computer-based information and electronic shopping
service, which is owned by IBM and Sears, Roebuck, & Co., has
also entered into an agreement with First Interstate of Denver to
provide the banking service.  Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of
New York will do processing for the Denver bank.
      Prodigy has not come up with a bank for the Miami area as of
yet, but it's a foregone conclusion that the information service
is looking for a banking partner for the area.
      Even sophisticated technology is not immune to occasional
outages.  A Prodigy Services Co. computer went down on May 8,
after a glitch in the software package caused the computer to
overload, and precipitate intermittent outages for the nationwide
on-line system (VT, March 1989, p. 4).
      The computer-based information and electronic shopping
service was "on and off Monday night and Tuesday," said Brian Ek
of Prodigy.
      By [early] Wednesday, "service was restored to some parts of
the nation, and by 8:00 p.m. Wednesday, the service was
completely restored," Ek added.
      Ek said the company will continue to monitor the system, but
the "fix was put in place before the peak usage time on Wednesday
night."  He said he was confident about the restoration but added
no one could promise problems would not occur again.

VIDEOTEX SERVICES FORM MARKETING CONSORTIUM TO SEED CONSUMER
MARKET

     In an effort to provide a shot in the arm to the residential
electronic messaging services marketplace, 7 key videotex
services in the United States joined forces in September 1989 to
promote consumer videotex.  VIEWTEXT discovered that the new
group, dubbed the Videotex Marketing Consortium, planed to seed
the consumer market with access terminals by selling more than
50,000 French Minitels to the regional Bell operating companies
(RBOCs) at a low cost.
      Under the tentative plan, the RBOCs would acquire the
terminals from the group and would distribute them to consumers.
The terminals would be rented at a rate of $7 to $10 per month,
although direct sales of the terminals to interested customers
would be another likely option.
      The 7 members of the consortium are BASELINE II Inc., CTL
Communications Inc., General Videotex Inc., Minitel Services Co.,
Minitel U.S.A. Inc., U.S. Videotel and Videotex Development Corp.
Additional firms are expected to join the group within the next
few weeks.
      Members of the group with services on the new Bell operating
company gateways reported seeing tremendous growth in usage in
the Southwestern Bell Houston market, which was seeded with
terminals, when compared with other markets.
      "We don't think this difference is a question of climate,"
he continued.  "The main factor separating the Houston experience
from that of Burlington, Vt.; the New York City area; Washington,
D.C.; Atlanta and Philadelphia, is that there is a strong
marketing commitment and that terminals--or access devices--are
available in Houston and nowhere else."

Negotiations under way with terminal manufacturers

      All of the members of the group have vowed to invest in the
promotion of the terminals in key Gateway markets.  The Gateway
operator in each case will be contacted to participate in the
promotion and will handle the consumer billing.
      The consortium has set aside a $20 million-plus advertising
and marketing budget to accomplish the task.
      "We got involved in videotex because our service is in the
Minitel format," Linda Brown, director of marketing and
development at Baseline II, an on-line information service for
the film and television industry and a key member of the group,
explained.
      The consortium's efforts, Brown said, will focus on trying
to "re-enact the experience in France" in which French consumers
received terminals at no cost and were charged access charges for
the on-line services they used.
      "We are convinced that the Gateway videotex market is about
to explode in the U.S.," Bruce Forgrieve of U.S. Videotel said.
      "We have proven that our services can be successful when we
work with an RBOC that has adopted a large-scale access device
and marketing strategy.  All that remains for additional success
is to get access devices into the hands of consumers.  This plan
will provide a major impetus to the birth of a new industry."
      In other videotex industry events, Robert Smith, executive
director of the Videotex Industry Association, confided that
within the next year "regional gateways will take a hard look at
gateway business."
      His biggest concern was that "senior managers will forget it
is a long-term business, and view it as short term."  The
executive director emphasized that "this is a business of the
future."  He reminded us it was clearly not a "get rich quick"
business.

THE MINITEL COMES OF AGE AND COMES TO AMERICA

      As the Minitel system in France nears a decade of service,
and boasts 4.5 million users enjoying access to 11,000 services,
France Telecom has set it sights on expanding its services
abroad.  This effort has been focused on the North American
market through its Intelmatique international division, which
includes subsidiaries Minitel USA, Minitel Services Company, and
Minitelnet Inc.
      The 11,000 videotex information services, all France Telecom
has to offer, were made available over Minitelnet Inc. to North
American users of the Minitel network on May 1.  Minitel can be
accessed from over 160 locations in the United States.
Previously, Minitelnet Inc. accessed only 1,500 information
services, and the recently added French Electronic Directory
Service, which offers 25 million white and yellow page listings
in French and English.
      A recent expansion of the Minitel system allows North
American ISPs to market their services online to the over 4
million subscribers in France.  The service is offered through a
network operated by Minitel Services Co., a partnership of
Infonet and Minitel USA.  Local access charges from cities
accross the country vary from 15 cents per minute to $1.65 per
minute.

Now available on RBOC gateways

      The French videotex services are now available on 5 of the
RBOCs' gateways, Southwestern Bell, Bell South, Nynex, U S West
and Bell Atlantic.
      The U S West gateway, which was developed in partnership
with Minitel USA, began providing services in November.  Minitel
terminals are being leased to U S West gateway users in Omaha.
      Scott Magee, director of Minitelnet, said he expected "the
number of English language services to grow" as usage increased.
He added, "We expect to be on all the RBOC gateways within a
year."

Thomas Morgan, VIA chairman, hints of more intelligent terminals

      Thomas Morgan, vice president of Quantum Computer Services
and chairman of the Videotex Industry Association (VIA), told
VIEWTEXT last spring that most RBOCs or online information
services going outside the PC arena had gone with Teletel,
Minitel or dumb terminals but "one unannounced RBOC was planning
to go with a more intelligent terminal."
      Sources concluded that the unannounced RBOC would have been
Pacific Bell, which was at that time planning its now defunct
service.
      Morgan said his company does not consider information
services a mass marketplace at the present time, but more of a PC
arena.
      Another significant issue was the calling number for gateway
services.  Numbers, of course, vary for different areas of the
country.
      Morgan said intelligent software should be able to make the
call and set up service with other intelligent software.
      The VIA president concluded that it was important to have
"acquisition [as well as] retention" of customers.  He felt that
if electronic mail could be worked off-line and be connected to
voice and fax, and international connectivity could be achieved,
progress was truly being made.
      He said he considers inter-connectivity with matching
transaction codes vital to the scheme.
      Blocking services or requiring users to fill out written
requests "ignores services that have shown response."  There are
other means of controlling a secure environment.  Morgan contends
that as more is learned, customers are more interested in price
then ONA and do not have their own network and will not have one
either.

JUDGE GREENE REFUSES INTER-LATA GATEWAY SERVICE

     One of the most significant regulatory events of 1989
concerned the future of inter-LATA videotex gateway services
provided by the RBOCs.  It hasbeen placed in question by Judge
Harold Greene's recent decision against Bell Atlantic.
      The judge's strict interpretation of the Modified Final
Judgment (MFJ) on Jan. 24, 1989, has stopped the RBOCs from
routing information services across local telephone boundaries
using a single gateway processor.
      Bell Atlantic had proposed that a customer could dial a
local node in another part of Pennsylvania and be connected with
the gateway processor in Philadelphia over a leased line.
      The central processor would then provide the customer with a
menu of service providers as well as an index of services.
      After the customer made a selection, the centrally located
gateway processor in Philadelphia would tell the local node to
make the connection with the appropriate service provider.  The
actual connection would be provided by the local telephone
company.

Greene rules architecture to be interexchange

      Greene turned down Bell Atlantic by saying it was
"inescapable that the gateway architecture Bell Atlantic is
proposing would operate on an interexchange basis, and that it
would therefore constitute an interexchange service prohibited by
section II(D)(1) of the decree."
      Bell Atlantic had claimed "the transmission provided in the
context of the gateway service did not violate the decree because
"it is analogous to the regional companies' provision of official
services across LATA boundaries which this court approved shortly
after the breakup."
      The company said the centralized arrangement was no
different from the centralized arrangements it uses to provide
existing telephone services like directory assistance which are
considered official services.
      These services were permitted by the original decree that
broke up the Bell System.
      Judge Greene concluded that "in every significant respect,
it would be the central, multi-LATA processor, that would be the
information services gateway.
      "[Therefore,] the court holds that the operation of a
centralized gateway processor is not an official service."

Centralized gateway service--a new and competitive service

      Greene added, "the centralized gateway service constituted
the heart of a new and competitive service.  On that basis alone,
the attempted analogy with official services has no reasonable
basis."
      Richard Levine, a consultant at the Touche Ross Service
Center in Washington, D.C., told VIEWTEXT that "while the judge's
decision seems to be saying 'no' to centralized use of menus,
there was a slight possibility that a region might be able to get
a narrowly founded waiver of the restriction to support a gateway
for a less populous LATA."
      Levine, an expert in telecommunications regulatory services,
said Judge Greene was concerned about allowing BOCs to operate
these centralized services.  The judge clearly did not want to
set a precedent.
      Levine did say he felt it would be "unfortunate if rural
areas were deprived of gateway services" because of the ruling.
      "Judge Greene's ruling has caused an adverse financial
effect on the BOCs' incentive to employ gateway services in
extended rural areas or smaller LATAs.  The Justice Department
has still not taken a position on the waiver.  It would be
appropriate to give some help on the ruling at this time."

Bell Atlantic's alternative: Justice Department or waiver

      A spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic said the company had "asked
for a ruling, not a waiver.  It only asked if it was a
permissible service, not for a waiver."
      The company considered Greene's stand too strong and lacking
sympathy; however, the issue has not been confronted as a waiver.
This could be an alternative to the situation as it stands.
      Bell Atlantic had the choice of going before Judge Greene or
the Justice Department to file a waiver.
      The RBOC did not think a waiver was necessary.  It had asked
the court to declare that it could use one computer to provide
gateway services throughout the entire state of Pennsylvania.
      The RBOC pointed out that such an arrangement would hold
down the cost of this service, and would provide services to
rural areas and urban centers.
      Bell Atlantic estimated that the cost of putting gateway
equipment in all 5 Pennsylvania LATAs would be approximately $2
million.
      In Bell Atlantic's LATA regions alone, the population ranges
from 200,000 customers to 5 million customers.  There are a total
of 161 LATAs in the United States.

Pacific Telesis looks to interexchange carrier

      Bill Adler, executive director of regulatory matters for
Pacific Telesis,
said his company "will be looking at the possibility of an
interexchange carrier providing any interchange services.
      "Such companies as MCI, AT&T, or other resellers would be a
possibility; California has 120 interexchange carriers operating
in the state.  The problem is they do not operate everywhere in
the state.  We feel like this might have more chance of a
success."
      Adler did say, "Bell Atlantic's proposal was more efficient
and cost-effective.  One of the drawbacks of MFJ is that it gives
engineers heartburn."
      Bell Atlantic had also been prohibited by Greene from even
leasing packet switching lines to carry inter-LATA calls to
gateways.  Thus, Pacific Telesis may turn to the interexchange
carriers as a possible answer to the problems.
      While opposition to RBOC powers continues to be the norm in
the courts, the U.S. Congress is contemplating legislation that
would provide some relief.  It is likely that some progressive
action will be taken on the issue in the coming year.

Advantec Network Solutions has tied up with Allied Telesyn
International, USA, for distributing the latter's networking products in
India. Allied's product range comprises low end hubs, network interface
cards, and transceivers. The products will be distributed through
Advantec's distribution channels which include around 126 systems
integrators and resellers. Though Advantec distributes hubs of UB
Networks as well, it does not see any fundamental conflict in taking up
Allied's products. For one, the primary product offering from Allied is
transceivers. Its hubs are mainly in the low end and as such do not
compete with UB's hubs which are primarily targeted at the mid range and
enterprise market. Besides, says Joshua Barton, vice-president of
Advantec, "Being a distributor and not a value-added reseller ensures
that we will not push one particular product. Sales is customer
dependent."

Additionally, to strengthen its channel network, Advantec has recently
introduced a programme, "Compass", to enable small systems integrators
to take on multi-location projects, which they could not do earlier due
to geographical or resource constraints. Advantec will play the role of
the connecting agent by partnering the small systems integrators with
other systems integrators in its network. In addition, support will be
provided through training, technical planning, and product sourcing.

looking at expanding its base in a competitive environment.

NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA'S UNIQUE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

It comes as a part of Motorola's unique distribution strategy to
popularize pagers and the paging concept. The showroom - Kamsons Page
Shoppe - is located at Jail Road, in West Delhi. Inaugurating the
showroom, DR Mehta, president, RPG Paging, and Fernando Gomez,
vice-president and general manager, Motorola, Asia-Pacific Paging
Subscriber Division, stressed the need for providing better services and
education to the users. The showroom is expected to provide Delhites
enhanced paging awareness. It is positioned as a one-stop-shop for all
the paging requirements, which also includes the subscription collection
centre.

"We will be providing the entire range of pagers available under one
roof. Besides this, we will entertain all queries that prospective users
may have," explained VK Adlakha, managing director, Kamson Page Shoppe.

RPG has plans to open four showrooms in three cities - Ahmedabad, Delhi,
and Madras in which it is likely to be operational by December 1996.

Motorola has plans to open 35 exclusive showrooms on similar lines, in
association with paging operators by June 1997, across the country.
The recently opened showroom in Delhi is the tenth in the series of
Motorola's retail outlets in the country. Commenting on the response to
these outlets, Gomez said, "The customers' response in all these cities
has been overwhelming. In fact, the Ludhiana showroom, sold 59 pagers
on the opening day itself."

Delhi has emerged as the second largest paging market in India with over
45,000 subscribers.

CONNECT INDIA '96: A success show, going by the number of participants,
displays, and visitors

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Despite the prolonged sultriness of Delhi, Connect India '96 went off
very smoothly in the spacious air-conditioned halls of Taj Palace.
Inaugurated on 29 September by ex-DoE secretary, N Vittal, the man
behind the Telecom Policy 1994. "Connectivity is the operating word ...

Technology is giving us options, but we should make sure of its
utilizations," proposed Vittal in his inaugural speech, followed by the
cutting of ribbon to begin the show.

The companies participating in the show included most of the biggies in
the industry. Among them were Adroit Technologies, Accel Automation,
Datamatics, Elnet Technologies, HTL, Intel Asia Electronics, Intex
Technologies (India), ITI, Microsense Computers, Netran Information
Access, Pioneer Digital, Seacom Solutions, Technoware Systems, Tropicana
Enterprises, Usha Communication, Vertex Infotech, VSNL, Voxtron Dezign
Lab, and Worldwide Technologies.

Intel was greeting the visitors with its big and furnished stall. In
fact, it had put up its ad on the very threshold of the exhibition. And
the best designed stall was undoubtedly that of Microcom. The company
that seemed to have taken back its presence was Voxtron Dezign Lab. The
reason--not disclosed. Tropicana Enterprises, an associate of Kelvinator
and now the authorized dealer of AirTel services and distributor of
Casio pagers, was giving away free wrist watches when one purchased a
pager. The stall was mostly crowded with visitors peeping into for a
window shop of pagers and cell phone models.

The thrust areas of exhibition seemed to be Internet, Connectivity, and
Modems. There had been seminars going since morning till evening. The
organizations taking part in the conference included ITI, Bharti,
Qualcomm, DoT, VSNL, MTNL, NIIT, and HTL. Eminent speakers were invited
to speak on conferences. And spoke Vijay Thadani from NIIT on NII, BA
Majmudar from Qualcomm on CDMA in rural communication, RK Gupta from
VSNL on Internet and others on various other subjects.

And VSNL sponsored to take care of the gourmet's stomach in between the
long hours of conference sessions.

It was definitely a three-day mega show with visitors crowding in. The
age group ranged from little ones to elderly persons. And, the
visibility of people from the armed forces as well as police forces was
there. Making a great effort and a real success.

JB PANY - A STAR OF THE EAST

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

"Technology will eliminate the so-called physical barriers," comments
Jyoti Bhushan Pany, managing director, Radiant Electronics Ltd. Today,
FM RDS paging, Radiant, and JB Pany are really a dream team in the
Indian paging industry. Now, Radiant has its operation in 16 out of the
17 cities, where FM RDS paging is available.

JB Pany or Dulal Pany, as his friends call him lovingly, is modest,
casual, calculative, and polished. He always believes in the
theory--learn to live happily. This man from Orissa was born on 10 July
1953 in Cuttack. His father was a government servant and mother a simple
Oriya housewife, very caring and affectionate. After completing his
schooling and intermediate in Orissa he joined LIT, Nagpur, from where
he successfully completed his chemical engineering course in 1975. Then
Pany returned back to Orissa to be an entrepreneur.

His entrepreneurial strategy was simple--"get people better than you and
have faith in them". With this unique idea in mind, he started his
business in Bhubaneswar. First in 1981, he started developing aromatic
chemical, Bromostyrole. And in 1983, he formed a company, Mechem Pvt
Ltd, in collaboration with RTZ, Germany. Primarily, the company was
dealing in fibre glass and FRP. In the very next year, Mechem bagged a
major order from Nuclear Fuel Complex. However, the company also started
assembling TV sets on behalf of Surya Udyog in 1984. Giving a boost to
Pany's entrepreneurialship, his company received national award for
production excellence in 1987.

The year 1984-85 saw a major change. From chemicals the company switched
over to electronics. On 5 September 1986, Radiant Electronics Ltd was
incorporated. It is a joint sector company with Orissa State Electronics
Development Corp., in technical collaboration with C-DOT. In 1994, the
company diversified into FM RDS paging, through its division called
Radiant Connect.

He says that team work has been the key to the success of his company.
He is a man is grateful to all those who are behind his and Radiant's
success. Sam Pitroda is his role model. And, in Pany's opinion, Pitroda
is the man who shaped up Indian telecom revolution. He also gives credit
to the people of Orissa for their continuous encouragement.

On the family front too, Pany is leading a happy life. He met his better
half in Nagpur. He has all praises for her when he says, "she is more an
Oriya than a Maharastrian". She helps him in his business activities and
handles the TV assembling unit. She is also a very good wooden furniture
designer. The Pany couple has two children, a son and a daughter. Both
are studying at Dehradun.

Besides being an excellent manager, he is also a good leader. He was the
chairman of CII, Orissa. Once, travelling was his hobby. Now, it is a
necessity. He travels almost three cities in a week on business trips.

Besides travelling, he is also very fond of socializing and reading,
especially technical magazines. He loves to spend his spare time at the
golf course or in the billiards room. In fact, he has won the Jamshedpur
steel city billiards tournament too.

About his employees, he says that their union is one among the most
enlightened and disciplined ones in the country today. He feels proud of
them that they are, to some extent, the jack of all trades and the
master of FM RDS paging.

Coming to the future of FM RDS paging, he is very optimistic. And he
believes that once the nation-wide network is established, 70 percent of
country will be covered by Radiant.

With a vast experience behind him, Pany is the driving force at Radiant.
However, he is reluctant in admitting this and attributes everything to
his colleagues, saying that they are his strength. A virtue that drives
this Dulal Pany, relentlessly.

VIPIN MALHOTRA - SAW FAR, SAW GOOD

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

From TV to telecom, it is not a smooth transition normally. But then,
where there is a will, there is a way. And Vipen Malhotra,
vice-president, Arvind Telecom, is testament to this adage. A mature
face which reflects that experience has been the best teacher for him.
He wears a typical Punjabi look. Broad shoulders and a good height are a
certain plus in his personality.

Vipen was born on 11 August 1956 in Punjab. After completing his
schooling, he had his degree in electronics from Punjab Engineering
College, Chandigarh. To have a perfect combination--engineering coupled
with management--he went on to do his MBA from Punjab University. Vipen
started off his professional career as marketing executive at
Continental Devices India Ltd (CDIL) in 1980 in Ahemdabad. When CDIL
joined hands with a German company for colour TV technology transfer and
agency operations in India, Vipen turned out to be a shot in the arm for
CDIL. He managed all the affairs almost single handedly and brought in a
tremendous business for the company. He was then promoted as marketing
manager and was asked to take on an additional responsibility area. And
this was to market the CTV components which did not come with the
original kit.

He did that job well too and acquired a considerable marketshare for the
company. It was in 1986 that he came up with an idea of fusing
technology with style. To launch the range of vertical black and white
TVs. But CDIL was not ready for the investment required. And Vipen, as
ever, was a man who wanted to change with the times. He joined Arvind
Mills' electronic division as general manager, operations, in September
1987.

It was here that his life took a full turn. And it was here that his
career bloomed. Arvind Mills' telecommunication division had then
designed a small EPABX system in-house. The problem that lay ahead was
its mass production and marketing countrywide. Vipen accepted the
challenge. He worked vigorously on the project and brought down the cost
of production to a considerable level. Not satisfied with just this, he
went on to successfully sell around 250 exchanges in just a short span
of nine months. Albeit, Arvind Mills ventured late into the big and
complex arena of telecommunication, it soon became one of the big names
in rural automatic exchange manufacturing under his active leadership.
The company is on the verge of almost tripling its production of small E
PABXes.

On the workfront, his vision is to make Arvind Telecom, India's largest
suppliers of small EPABX systems and to eat a major share of the radio
trunking pie in India. "We are already in a process of establishing
ourselves in 10 cities in the trunked radio business licensed to us and
are working on making a name in the field of Public Mobile Radio Trunked
Services," says Vipen. For trunked radio, his company has a tie-up with
EF Johnson of the US.

When he is not thinking of telecom and business, he loves to watch
cricket with his elder son who is nine-and-a-half years old. In his
college times, Vipen used to be the captain of his university badminton
team and a member of the tennis team. These days, he is keen on golf. He
also likes to potter in his house garden whenever he manages to do that.

Reading happens to be another favourite pastime with him. And that is
mostly on business and modern management techniques. As far as the music
goes, he prefers golden oldies--both Western and Indian (non classical).

Wife Radhika was earlier into ethnic dress designing, but with the birth
of his second son who is two-and-a-half years old now, she prefers
devoting full time to the family for Vipen.

Things were not easy initially, but then he climbed the heights. Rightly
said, its all in the attitude. Coupled with aptitude. And he is a fine
example.

PAGING - THE VOICE MATTERS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The operators' job is not a dull one, after all. There is excitement and
fun, as well.

Every telecom service segment--cellular, E-mail, or VSAT--calls for its
own skillset. What makes paging so special, however, is that in the
actual service-delivering, no other communication service involves human
beings. In paging, the interface with the customer is a voice. And much
of the subscriber perception emanates from the voice.

The more live and vibrant the voice, the better it is. A disembodied
mechanical voice is a complete put off. Says Sandip Das, CEO, Hutchison
Max Telecom (MaxPage), "The human interface holds a great deal of
importance in the Indian context." Apparently, research into Asians and
their interaction has revealed that Asians relate much better to humans
than machines. It is in this context that the role of a paging operator
becomes critical. Besides, in the Indian context, the operator's role
carries more importance as operator-assisted paging is more popular in
comparison to automatic paging. A paging operator has to do more than
just receive and send messages.

Once they receive a message, the paging operators have to verify it
while keying the message simultaneously into the computer in front of
them and send it off. The job carries a lot more responsibility; the
voice has to convey a sense of reliability and also sustain the
freshness and vibrancy through the day. All the senses should be alert
as she has to listen to the message and enter it on the terminal
simultaneously. Besides, they are required to have multi-lingual skills
to translate messages. For instance, when a message comes in Marathi,
the operator should be in a position to translate and enter it in
English on the spot. Hence, knowledge of at least two languages,
depending upon the location, is a prerequisite for this job.

Surely, sitting in front of a terminal eight hours a day, constantly
listening to messages and sending them after a double check, cannot be
all that exciting. Instead, it is bound to be taxing and tiring. So the
onus of keeping the paging operators motivated lies with the employer,
as the quality and performance of the people who form the "voice" will
determine to a large extent the success of the service provider. So the
key is to keep the voice as good as possible. For as much time as
possible. That is what every paging operating company is trying to do.

It is an HRD exercise of a different sort.

It could vary from designating paging operators as paging officers to
providing them with cafeteria and rest room with TV and music system to
relax. While on one hand, the designation bestows the operators with a
sense of dignity, the restroom helps these operators to take a break in
the midst of their gruelling day. For, on an average, an operator
handles around 50-60 calls an hour. During peak hours, this number is
likely to go up by 50 percent.

On an average, an operator handles around 50-60 calls an hour. During
peak hours, this number is likely to go up by 50 per cent.

Running through most of the service providers, the sops offered are more
or less similar. For instance, all of them have introduced uniforms to
impart a sense of uniformity and to eliminate any differences that may
have surfaced due to economic or cultural factors. The distinctive
flavours come in the form of throwing open the field to employees to
design their uniforms, like in the case of MaxPage, which changes the
uniform every six months. What it does promote a sense of belonging and
pride in the organization. Says Sandra Mahadwar, head (human resources),
MaxPage, "They are able to give their expression to their
creative urgings."

Nearly all of them arrange outdoor activities which could be sports like
at RPG Paging or picnics at DSS Communications. In a city like Mumbai,
Pagepoint Services, a Motorola joint venture, adds a dash of excitement
by having a bash at a disco. Here, the operators have an opportunity to
socialize not only among themselves but also with the rest of the
company staff which brings about a team feeling. In addition to these,
there are in-house magazines and cultural events. Modelling for the
company is also not ruled out. For all its advertisements, MaxPage has
roped in only its employees to model.

Despite the similarity, most go a little further in different ways. For
instance, at RPG Paging Services, Madras, a recreation club has been set
up within the office premises equipped with exercycle, indoor sports,
and aerobic facilities. Pagepoint follows a five-day week pattern for
all its employees, including the paging operators. Says Micheal Latimer,
president, Pagepoint Services, "They have two days to themselves, to
relax and get ready for another hectic week and as they are an integral
part of Pagepoint there is no reason why they shouldn't enjoy similar
benefits."

All of these become relevant in the light of the fact that most
operators--on an average 60 percent--are women. Some, like MaxPage, have
a 100 percent women workforce in some select cities like Bangalore and
Mumbai. The night shifts are usually managed by male operators with some
exceptions like at MaxPage in Bangalore and Mumbai. Says Suresh
Srinivasan, general manager, Pagepoint Services, "It is purely for
safety reasons that we have men in the night shift as then transport and
security are not an issue." Despite this, MaxPage prefers to have women
on the rolls. It does add a bit to their expense list, given that they
have a duty officer and security staff during night shifts.

We put people ahead of paging

Besides, they pick and drop their "officers" outside their doorstep.
MaxPage even encourages the applicants to bring their parents along when
called for an interview. While the candidate is undergoing the
interview, parents are given a tour of the office and shown the
facilities that will be provided to a paging officer.

Now moves like these come handy, specially in small cities like Ludhiana
which tend to be conservative and where parents are not as open to
sending their "girls" to work. It is precisely for these reasons that
most service providers have men in their night shift. Though at RPG,
women working in the last shift between 12.15 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. are
entitled to a car drop back home, women working in the last shift is
generally avoided. Says Preetha R Ramakrishnan, assistant manager
(personnel and administration), RPG Paging, "Due to personal
constraints, women are not asked to work at night."

We believe we should trust and respect our employees

Apart from these, operators are given awards and incentives in order to
motivate them to perform better. Most of them have fairly elaborate
monitoring system. Based on the observation, the operator is given a
feedback and the freedom to evolve a self correcting process. "This,
says Latimer, "helps operators perceive their role better." The ultimate
aim is getting the operators to understand that they play a key role in
satisfying the customer. And, hence, the efforts of the company are
directed towards this goal. Pagepoint has an award for the "best paging
operator" for the week, month, and year. Apart from that incentives are
given, based on various parameters both qualitative and quantitative.

These also help in taking the drudgery and monotony of the job. Unlike
other jobs, an operator's job (in spite of being called paging officers)
does not provide too many avenues for growth within the organization.

Not that they cannot opt for anything else. Sure they can go from being
an operator to a shift supervisor or they could move into other areas
like customer service or finance, depending on their preferences and
capabilities.

Well, given the competitive nature of business today, most
companies--service and non--service--have come to realize that the cost
of training a fresher is disproportionate to the money spent on these
activities, which have long-term benefit. However, in the paging
industry, it takes more preeminence because of the "people intensive"
operations and more dependance on the human factor than the technology.
Given these, the attrition rate among paging operators is very low.

They all claim that none of them have lost any of their operators to
competitors. Of course, poaching is against IPSA rules. The rule is not
a law in itself but more of a gentlemen's agreement. Most of them claim
to have lost paging operators not due to the nature of the job but more
due to personal reasons like marriage. In fact, the nature of the job or
working in shifts have not been a deterrent for many is the general
refrain.

The working environment created and policies have had their effect on
manpower turnover and also in recruitment. According to Latimer,
"Initially, recruitment was through the medium of advertisements but
today it has shifted to word-of-mouth and referrals. All the propaganda
is done by the paging operators themselves." And this Latimer attributes
to the excellent atmosphere created within the company.

No doubt, the companies have had to spend in order to create the
"comfort zone". But it is a cost that has been factored in at the time
of budgeting for infrastructure. However, none of them is willing to
reveal just what percentage it took up of the entire investment. One
reason for this advance planning could be that all the service providers
have joint ventures going with MNC partners. These partners carry with
them their experiences in other countries.

A lot has been written and said about paging as an industry but little
has been discussed about the human face of the operations, the
occupational hazards, and how companies are taking care of their
employees. In Das' words, "As far as India goes, our vision proved
right. A strong service orientation is the right approach as hardware is
incidental to business." And human resources is inextricably linked to
this vision which is reflected across the paging industry.

"WE LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OPEN TO CHANGE"

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

What does Ericsson look for in its prospective employees. And why? How
does it develop a positive feeling among employees? Ranjit Bhatia,
general manager and chief (human resources & administration), Ericsson
Telecommunications, explains in an interview with Shyamanuja Das.

What are the qualities that you look for in a person while recruiting?
We look for people who are more flexible to change. Particularly, when
we recruit experienced people, we always look for people who are not
very rigid. But for people who will embrace change. Because that is
Ericsson culture. That is how this industry is. You have to be open to
change. You have to be in constant lookout for change. For new options.
New styles. New environments.

What is your policy on recruiting fresh graduates?

We do not go to campuses. Recruiting from campuses is good. But it is
time consuming. The average time is eight months. Who has got that kind
of time in this industry? Last year, when we recruited in bulk, we
advertised for fresh candidates.

How important is the label of a college/university?

Depends on the nature of job. I can go for an IIT graduate, if I am
recruiting someone for a planning kind of job. For a hands-on job, we
prefer graduates from other engineering colleges.

What about marketing and other such functions?

Almost for all marketing positions, we recruit engineers. And that too,
only electronics and telecommunication engineers. The concept of
marketing is slightly different in this industry. We are not selling
consumer products. We are selling solutions to operators. That requires
not only an understanding of technology, but also knowledge of what can
be offered to the customer as a solution. It is more of business
development than marketing. We cannot afford to take a non-engineer.
Only for publicity etc., we take MBAs.

Where do you get middle level people from?

Engineers from PSUs, C-DOT, etc. have joined us. For marketing, we
develop our own people. There is no other way out. They are given
responsibility at a quite young age. Our average age in marketing is
28-30 years.

What are the problems you face, if at all, while recruiting?

Getting good field support staff is a problem. Very few people have the
customer orientation that this kind of job demands.

How do you manage to get good people in an extremely competitive
recruitment market?

Let me clarify on one point. We pay well. (But) we are not the best
paymasters. We do not try to be. Our objective is to be a very good
employer. We look at providing all comforts to an employee. We encourage
decision making. Above all, he is respected as an individual.

We conduct training programmes for the employee's overall growth. We are
now carrying out a continuous training programme as a project, with
active participation from our Sweden office. It is called Competence
Management and it aims to help an employee develop business competence,
technical competence, and human values. We also send them abroad for
technical trainings.

With a certain degree of pride, I can say that there has been negligible
employee turnover in Ericsson in recent months.

In general, what are the positive and negative factors in the
recruitment scenario in India?

One thing good about India is the availability of people, not necessarily
skilled, but who can be trained. The basic education is good in India.
In software, we have got skilled people.

On the flip side, people here are very low on accountability and
customer orientation. Accountability can only be built into the system
if we put thrust on it in our educational system, itself. Now, one way
of doing that is better co-operation between the campus and corporate.

In a market-driven world, that is a necessity. Then, we won't keep on
training our youngsters on something in the campus and something else in
the job. There will be no duplication of efforts.

HOW HCL GROUP RECRUIT ITS PEOPLE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

"We do not recruit for individual companies because we want to ensure
movability within the group."

How does HCL Corp., known for its high people-orientation, recruit its
people? Sujit Baksi, the company's director & president, HRD, tells
Shyamanuja Das.

What is the basic recruitment principle of HCL Corp.?

We believe in recruiting freshers and developing them. We recruit
globally. In Singapore, Thailand, UK, US, and of course India. We take
engineers and MBAs from premier engineering and management institutes
and colleges.

How common or different are your recruitment procedures for different
group companies?

We do not recruit for HCL-HP or HCL Comnet. We recruit for HCL Corp.
Basic skill requirements for a marketing person or a technical support
person is similar in all the companies, barring a few R&D jobs. So a
fresher is taken for HCL Corp. We do that because we want to ensure a
high degree of movability within the group. Our recruitment, hence, is
function-oriented, not company oriented.

Why at all is there a need for that?

IT is a very flexible industry. Only thing that is constant here is
change. Tomorrow, we may enter some new business, exit from something
else. The person must be ready to handle different jobs, different
situations.

How do you find such people?

We look for some basic attitudes. A logical and analytical bent of mind
is a necessity. And we look for persons with high tolerance for
ambiguity. The person must be adaptive. He should be able to adapt to
changes. To new jobs. To new people. To new countries. Also, we look for
people who have motivation to achieve. This is in addition to the
specific skills required for the job and academics. We give a lot of
importance to academics. We believe academic records say a lot about the
student.

What is a typical recruitment process in HCL Corp.?

As I told you earlier, we take only freshers. We go to institutes like
IIMs, FMS, and Bajaj among management institutes. For engineering
graduates, we go to IITs, BITS, and selected RECs.

The entire process takes about one year. In fact, for our July '97
recruitment, we have already started in June last. We organize meets
with students where our top management goes and talks about the company
and the kind of opportunities that lie. Shiv Nadar himself has gone and
spoken. This year, we are planning to start this exercise in October.
Ex-students of these schools also go to campuses.

Once a student is selected, he is treated as an employee of the company.
From getting a B'day card to receiving information regarding the
activities of the company, he is made to feel as a member of the HCL
family. We also organize periodical visits of these students to company.

What are the problems you face?

Of course, sometimes there are certain mind blocks. HCL is perceived to
be a hardware company, though that is far from truth. We are second only
to TCS in software. And those who want a cushy kind of job, we cannot
provide. Right from day one, you have to be hands-on. Another fear that
is there is HCL is a very task-oriented company, which is a fact. So one
wanting a secure, slow job is not a typical HCL fit-in.

In spite of best of your efforts, there must be some people who will
fail to deliver...

They will have to go. No matter how thorough is the selection procedure,
there will always be some people who will be like that. That number is
very small in HCL. (But) they have no place. We cannot carry passengers.

It is perceived that some group companies like NIIT and HCL Comnet are
more employee-friendly than others like HCL Frontline and even HCL-HP...

I don't agree. There is a common policy. If someone has tried something
successfully in one of the companies, we implement that in other
companies. (So) there is no scope for any discrepancy. For finding out
what is best in each company we regularly conduct meetings called BIG
(Best In Group), where the chiefs of companies meet and discuss what
they have tried.

There is a belief that there is a mad rush towards telecom from all
other fields. And the biggest loser is IT. What is your observation.

What does this mean for HCL?

I agree that IT is losing a lot of skilled manpower to telecom. But for
a group like HCL, where there is enough scope to work in the latter, I
do not think that is a major problem. Our employee turnover has been
very low.(But) at the same time, I must admit that a few of them have
left and joined some MNCs.

COMMUNICATION CAREER - A COMPELLING ISSUE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

WE Indians believe that we have one of the best technical manpower in
the world. Quite rightly too. Various surveys and studies have
reaffirmed this fact from time to time, the latest being the World
Economic Forum (WEF) Report On Global Competitiveness. India ranks among
the top three nations in the world in terms of availability and quality
of engineers.

Yet, finding right people still remains the toughest job for the
corporates--multinationals and Indian companies alike. And vice versa.
Unemployment is not a problem anymore, at least, for professional
degree/diploma holders. Misemployment is. Unless that is checked, it has
the potential to have a negative effect on the workforce in particular
and the growth of Indian business in general.

Let us define misemployment. In short, it is the wrong employer-employee
association. With higher level of professional knowledge and better
skillset, the expected level of satisfaction from one's job has gone up
tremendously. So has the employer's expectation from the employee. For
the best results, a perfect sync between attitudes of the employee and
the employer is a must. If there is a mismatch, there is bound to be
problem. That qualifies for a misemployment.

If the employers and employee do not choose each other carefully before
their association, it backfires. While employers have large HRD
departments doing the job, very few employees do that. As a result,
there is dissatisfaction that results in frequent job changes, stress,
and a fall in productivity level. The sole culprit is information. Or
rather, the lack of it.

The turnover and the product profile of a company are not the best
information to act on for making a career move into a company. One need
to know about the culture of a company, what are the qualities that the
company looks for, and what kind of a person will fit well into that
organization, before taking any decision on joining it.

These are the kind of information that we will provide you in this new
section COMCAREERS. The HRD chiefs of companies will directly tell you
what their companies look for and who is the right kind of person, and
what is expected of him. From time to time, we will throw light on areas
in which there are information gaps. This time, we have interviews with
HRD chiefs of two different types of companies. One is a fully Indian
transnational, HCL Corp.; other is a typical joint venture between an
European and an Indian company, Ericsson Telecommunications Ltd. The
size, the working culture, the strengths, all are different. Plus, there
is a feature on paging operators that tries to remove many
misconceptions.

Feel free to write to us if you want to read about any particular issue
regarding recruitment, training, and other related areas.

SAYING IT THROUGH NUMBERS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

On the silver screen, the Hollywood hero uses his code, ILU, ILU. On the
LCD screen of your spouse's pager, you can use your own code. And that
could be a number.

That is exactly what the Chinese are doing. Many Chinese use a numeric
pager because it is cheap and numeric paging is easy to automate. So for
saying I Love You, it could be 111. For I love you too, it could be 222,
and so on. But how to remember so many codes? They have got a little
cute book of codes, known popularly as Bible Of Paging, where these
codes are listed. There are so many of them. The book is distributed by
the paging operators.

In India, some companies are already talking of that. So the next time
you want to say something, you perhaps will have the option of saying it
through numbers. But we have to evolve our own code. The Chinese code
for You are the nicest person I know could well be 420.

TEST AND INVEST: Unearthing of the telecom scam has led to scrips falling
at much more faster rate than other industries

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The telecom scam has delivered a body blow to the liberalization
process. The telecom scrips that were considered to be favourites have
no demand in the exchanges. The result is a continuous fall in the
prices. Telecom scrips have been falling at much more faster rate than
other industries. The small investor has lost confidence, which will
take time to build up.

After the presentation of union budget by the finance minister, the
market has been gradually sliding downwards. The downslide of the equity
shares is far more than what is reflected in the sensex. Scrips of new
companies which have entered the capital market recently either do not
find there quotations or most of them get traded in the range of Rs 1 or
2 in a day. Even their volumes are not exceeding 100-200 shares. The
budget has proved out to be disastrous for the stock market.

Introduction of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has deeply shaken the
confidence of investors. Stock market analysts are predicting that it
may take, almost, an year for the sentiments to improve.

The debt market has improved considerably and the institutions like
ICICI, IDBI, IFCI, and SCICI have already mobilized around Rs 6,000
crore and thus the money has been squeezed from the investor by the debt
instruments. There is no money left for the equity
instruments. Meanwhile, the deposit rate war between the non-banking
finance companies have intensified. Companies have started offering up
to 18 percent interest. While PAL Credit & Capital has announced its
interest rates of 17.5 percent for one year and 19 percent for four to
five years, Reliance Capital's rates are 15 percent and 18 percent,
respectively, for one and three years.

The BSE Sensex fell by 2 percent as it closed at 3,349.30 points on 20
September. Out of the total 58 shares listed, 48 went down, sensex 7
moved up, and three closed with no change. Datacom segment was the worst
affected as shares went down by 55 percent. Datapro went down by 90
percent and ICNET by 55 percent. Telephone cables is the worst
performing stock in telecom industry and is ranked fourth in list of top
5 losers in all companies listed in the exchanges. The share is quoting
at Rs 9 as against Rs 69 six months back.

The controversy over the VSNL's Euro issue has taken a new turn as the
Ministry of Telecommunication is suspecting a foul play in the
appointment of lead managers to the issue. The lead managers to the
issue are currently Kleinwort Benson, Jardine Flemming, and Salomon
Brothers and the company hopes to raise $700 through the issue. The
ministry suspects that more underwriting commission has been agreed in
case of VSNL. The controversy has certainly reversed the sentiments of
the investors.

Meanwhile, the board of directors of VSNL has proposed a 45 percent
dividend for 1995-96. The company has emerged amongst the top 10
tax-paying corporates in the country. It paid Rs 369.31 crore as
corporate tax.

A select few heavy-weighted scrips rallied smartly in a mixed pattern of
trading on the BSE. In general, the trend was downwards. Investors are
concentrating more on the debt market, resulting in brokers also
shifting their focus to the same.

BSE's decision to revamp the sensex has been hailed by the marketmen.
The inclusion of public sector stocks and giving weightage to new
sectors of the economy is the step in the right direction. The sensex
now will give the true picture of economy. The old sensex represented 19
percent of the market capitalization. A total of 15 new scrips have
replaced the old ones.

The Primary market in August was again deluge with a number of small
offers. The total mobilization through public offers during the month
fell to Rs 363 crore in August 1996 as against Rs 1,675 crore in July
and Rs 675 crore in May. However, the number of offers continued to be
high with as many as 87 companies tapping the market in August, 99 in
July, and 127 in June. Premium offers continued to remain out of sight
in August too. Only 11 out of the 87 offered were at the premium, with
the only Apcotex (Rs 105) and Super Auto (Rs 70) in high premium.

One of the major factors which supported the fall of the market is
SEBI's directive to extend the mark-to-market margin system to the
non-computerized stock exchanges. Because of this, the volumes declined
last month by 46 percent over the previous month.

As several companies are announcing book closures, the supply of the
stocks in the market will be reduced. Some stocks because of the
manipulation might increase for the shorter time frame. One should
carefully examine these stocks and avoid investments in these.

GLOBE WATCH: THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS FOR TELECOM REFORMS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

His name is Reed Hundt. He almost decides what the AT&Ts, Sprints, US
Wests, and Bell Atlantics should do in the next few years.

Sometimes, he also auctions air waves. For a change, he is now preaching
what other nations should do. Given below are his seven commandments.

I. Privatization does not conflict with or substitute for the rules of
competition.

II. Any nation that champions a national telecom firm and limits foreign
investment is wasting its money and turning down a big opportunity.

III. When governments intervene in markets in the name of guaranteeing
universal service, they generally do not make anything universal and
they do not enhance telecom service.

IV. Every country does not need two redundant wireline networks.

V. If you are not awarding spectrum licences by auction, you are making
a big mistake.

VI. After you auction the licences, let the market work. Systems rivalry
will speed technological innovation and countries should not bar
desegregation or combination of spectrum licences.

VII. The right goal for international communications is the same as the
goal for domestic communications--no more regulation of communications
services than of soap or software or shoes.

GLOBE WATCH: ARGENTINA ACHIEVES TWENTY PERCENT PHONE PENETRATION

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Argentina's Telefonica de Argentina claims to have achieved a phone
density index of 20 working lines for every one hundred inhabitants.
Telefonica took office in November 1990 and the phone density, then, was
12 lines for every one hundred inhabitants. Within six years, the index
has risen by 66.67 percent. The telecom company feels that such a growth
has been primarily due to heavy investment in telecom infrastructure
during the period. It was around $4.5 billion.

SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

A strategy, based on market segmentation, is essential to focus in an
evolving market.

When Nobel-laureate EF Schumacher wrote Small Is Beautiful (As If People
Mattered), cellular was certainly not in his mind. But the cellular
operators are fast realizing that small is indeed beautiful. Perhaps
much more beautiful than Schumacher imagined.

When cellular licences were being awarded, there was so much glamour and
clamour for the Mumbai licence. Most aggressive forecasts, bids, and
what not! Some even thought the rest was a waste. Today, Delhi has the
lead. Whether it is maximum number of cars or cell-phones, it is the same
success story of small entrepreneurs behind them.

Recently, we were on a search for a small office building ... there were
brokers and brokers but with a common factor ... all had a cell-phone,
in fact some had two, one from each of the two operators ... just in
case! When we looked for furniture ... again the same common factor. A
conspicuous cell-phone. The common factor stretches beyond ... our
lawyer carries one, our CA carries one, our freight agent carries one.

No wonder it is the small wonder!

But for now, we leave aside the small wonder called cellphone ... and
talk about the success story of the small business. Small business has
come to mean big business to cellular operators. Not only world-wide,
but in India too!

Delhi is obviously the trend setter in India. Today, travelling in a
Bombay suburban train if one sees a combination of "chappals" and
"cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff.

The Innovators

Most operators tend to launch with testimonial ads. Focus: Corporate Big
Wigs! No doubt almost all CEOs become the first subscribers though I
know several dogged exceptions. But where do the real numbers, usage,
and revenue come from? It is from the humble pockets of small businesses
with employees less than 10 sometimes; we include the self-employed too.

In the first year of service, over 95 percent of the revenue may come
from this segment. For cellular, small is big. Big market. It may take
sometime for cellphones to travel down the corporate echelons.

In the "consumer" segment, it takes two to three years to reach
"significant" level of penetration and airtime usage. We know, most
people prefer to charge to official account. Consumer segment will
mostly comprise of housewives, college going youngsters, and old people.
Majority go for it as "status symbol" or "snob value" and sometimes for
"security" reasons, mostly with very low airtime usage.

The Global Scenario

Today, small businesses and corporate segments account for about 70
percent of world cellular market and the consumer segment less than 30
percent. In some "not so highly dense" markets with about 10-12 percent
(still quite big for us) penetration, small businesses have been seen to
reach a cellular penetration of about 50 percent. While in "highly
dense" market like Sweden with 30 percent cellular penetration, small
businesses (less than 15 employees) have 85 percent penetration. Need we
say more?

The Cellular Way To Business

Cellular changes the way to business for a small businessman as he
learns to manage his time better--the cellular way. With a cellphone he
virtually carries his office around. Office and telephone do not tie him
down anymore. He could devote more time with his clients and in
travelling. For operator, it requires a customized concept selling to
address and target each of sub-segments based on the pattern of daily
activities which may differ for exporters, doctors, CAs, lawyers, estate
agents, freight agents, courier services, contractors, etc. It may
include specialized promotion for specific professions highlighting how
the service can help in improving efficiency and business. In Delhi, I
am told that almost 100 custom-agents subscribed to service en masse,
even the same model of handset.

Today, traveling in a Bombay suburban train if one sees a combination of
"chappals" and "cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff. It is not just
the basic unit of economic fabric but also the "big" star of cellular
world. Schumacher wrote, "There is wisdom in the smallness if only on
account of the smallness and patchiness of human knowledge... It is more
important that everybody should produce something than that a few people
should each produce a great deal... The task is to bring into existence
millions of new work places in the rural areas and small towns."
"Cellular will play a leading role in this task in India," Mr
Schumacher, "we assure you."

NEPOSTEL CONSULTANCY BV - CASHING IN ON TRAINING

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

With lot of private telecom operators starting their operations, the
company is eyeing a huge business opportunity. Reason enough for it
being in serious business.

Nepostel is the member of the KPN Group (Royal PTT Nederland NV). And,
it was founded in 1981 to offer Telecom and Postal Training and
Consultant Services to telecom and postal operators and service
providers using the expertise of PTT Telecom and PTT Post.

PTT Telecom, the Netherlands, is one of the most productive telecom
companies in the competitive market of Europe. Since its foundation,
Nepostel has worked in more than 50 countries in former Eastern Europe,
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The turnover of the company expressed
in Indian currency was Rs 56 crore in 1995, which is 10 percent more
than that in 1994.

Nepostel's relation with Indian customers dates back to 1991 when two
telecom managers attended a course--Management of Operations and
Maintenance of Modern Telecom Networks in the Netherlands. Since then,
Nepostel has formed a joint venture company called Orange Telecom
Software with TCIL for the development of telecom software locally,
which caters to the European market. Billing software and other customer
care software for the private telecom network operators seem to be the
major areas of operation for Orange Telecom Software.

Nepostel has also been instrumental in providing back-up consultancy for
a Videotex project in Delhi. It has provided training and consultant
services to Sterling Cellular and HFCL. Around 13 network engineers of
HFCL were trained by Nepostel in the Netherlands last year. The company
is the foreign collaborator in Beltron Telecommunications Ltd, a paging
operator with licences in six cities.

Nepostel's services have been delivered up till now through its
headquarters in the Hague. Currently, Nepostel is in the process of
setting up shop in India together with its partner, Svana Systems (P)
Ltd, in New Delhi. This joint venture company called Nepostel India Pvt
Ltd will be operational soon. It has been registered but is in a wait
for formal government approval. According to the company sources,
Nepostel India Pvt Ltd is expected to be launched by 15 October 1996.

Svana Systems, a small time telecom software developer itself, will now
be involved in project execution and marketing of all the ventures of
Nepostel in the country. "Project execution, not product development, is
and will remain our forte," says Shugan C Jain of Svana Systems. "There
is a lot of technical expertise available in the country, but managing
them together and bring business out of it is not an easy job. It
requires expert consultancy and thus justifies our existence," adds Jan
Joosten, senior consultant (training and organization), Nepostel.

Nepostel is an expert organization in feasibility studies, network
designs, consultancy for bid evaluation in a telecom tender, buying
decisions for network equipment, etc.

Till the time this venture comes into picture, Nepostel has already
started to deliver its services through Svana Systems. "In the near
future, we are planning to bring the best of training facilities in
India itself, rather than taking the Indian engineers to the
Netherlands," says Jain.

The first tangible result of this co-operation is a series of five open
courses for executives and managers of various telecom operators.
Nepostel focuses on all aspects of running a telecom network
effectively, whether fixed, GSM, paging, VSAT, MRTS, or other. Dutch
experts with hands-on experience in all aspects of telecom will carry
out or back-up the services offered by the newly hired staff of the
joint venture. The main aim is to deliver the highest quality of
training and consultancy in telecom and posts based on thorough
knowledge of the telecom and postal businesses and hands-on experience
of its consultants and trainers.

USHA COMMUNICATION - THE JUMBO IN MAKING

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

With the ever expanding officecom segment, Usha Communication is a
company to watch.

If you think foresight is the key to success of any business, it is true
of Usha Communication. "As a corporate, we think eight years in
advance," says Jai Dhar Gupta, managing director, Usha Electronics. This
Delhi-based company was established way back in 1968, with a product
focus of manufacturing telephones, intercoms, and small analogue
switches.

Right now, the company is into the manufacturing of state-of-the-art
ISBX systems. For this, it has entered into an alliance with Tadiran
Telecommunications, Israel, to manufacture and market its Coral brand of
ISBX, a technically advanced EPABX system. This Coral Automatic Call
Distribution (ACD) helps users by evenly distributing incoming calls,
and keeping track of calling patterns and performances. Manufacturing
these locally will give the company a tremendous cost advantage. The
other products are Coral Computer Telephony Interface (CTI), Coral AIR
(Wireless EPABX), and Coral ISDN PABX. The Coral ISDN PABX provides wide
bandwidth for voice, data networking, and videoconferencing. These ISDN
exchanges are fourth generation PBXes that will support voice, data,
video, wireless facilities, cellular facilities, voice mail as well as
ISDN and VSAT connectivity. The Coral AIR handset is like a wireless
extension.

The company has also entered an alliance with Cosmopolitan Electronics
of Taiwan for smaller PBXes with a capacity to handle 240 lines at a
time. The most modern thing about this is that this has a single pair
wire and also a digital one.

"Now hotel and paging are the two areas where there is lot of
opportunity," comments Gupta. And, that is why the company is targeting
these industries. Till date, Punwire is its major client. Usha
Electronics has installed EPABXes both for its POCSAG and FM RDS paging
services. And, very recently, the company has bagged its first order
from the hotel industry, i.e. Hotel Bright Star, which is coming up in
Delhi. It has also installed ISBX systems at Western Pagers and bagged
orders from Jindal and Oswal Group.

Among Public Sector Units, Indian Railway is their major client.
Everyday, 16-17 voice conferences take place between different offices
of the railways and Usha has to provide adequate facilities for this on
leased line voice conference. Apart from these areas, the company is
also trying to enter areas like banking and telecom. Other prospective
customers are from the banking and financial sectors, PSUs, and courier
industry. "We are looking forward for at least 20,000 connections,"
says Gupta. The company has already set up five EPABXes so far, and
expects to set up 18 more in near future.

"Customer satisfaction is our main look out," comes out Gupta. To ensure
this commitment, the company has a chain of 60 dealers, 10 branch
offices, agents located in almost all big and small cities across the
country. It also plans to open sales offices in the African and South
Asian regions. And, a team from Tadiran are in Delhi and Mumbai to sell
its products.

Usha Electronics' manufacturing unit at Okhla Industrial Area in New
Delhi has already into production. Very recently, the company has set up
its second unit at Bari Brahma near Jammu, complying with ISO 9001
standards, to manufacture and assemble digital ISDN customer premises
equipment for the Indian market. This will be the first of its kind in
the country to manufacture Integrated Services Business Exchanges
(ISBXes).

Gupta agrees with Voice & Data's prediction and says that communication
software is where future lies and his company will also move into
software development. According to him, his company will move into
computer telephony as they will have a market in 50 countries and also
sees the growth of networking market in India. With an expected turnover
of Rs 20 crore for the current fiscal, against Rs 9 crore in 1995-96,
Usha Communication is poised to find a new helm in the Indian
communications industry.

VSNL - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS GATEWAY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Long-term focus and better project executions place VSNL in the numero
uno spot.

Instability of world grandeur is not concurrent with Videsh Sanchar
Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the exclusive provider of public international telecom
services in India. Its is a steady journey of success and innovation
throughout.

And, for the government too, it is a preferred entity over MTNL. This is
obvious from the government's keen interest in keeping its stake high,
even after the expected GDR issue--66 percent. In the case of MTNL, the
government's stake is already down to 65 percent.

Now a bit history. The origin of India's external telecommunication is
actually dated back to as early as 1870 with the formation of British
India Submarine Telegraph Company. In 1872, Eastern Telegraph Company
(ETC) was formed. Fifty-one years down the lane, in 1923, another
company--Indian Radio Telegraph Company (IRT)--was formed.

Circa 1932. And, ETC and IRT merged into one--Indian Radio & Cable
Communications Company (IRCC). With Independence, IRCC was nationalized
and rechristened to Overseas Communications Service (OCS) in 1947.
March 1986 saw the conversion of OCS into an autonomous business
unit--VSNL--to improve operating performance.

In 1992, the government reduced equity holding to 82 percent and
increased private ownership to 18 percent. The expected GDR issue will
increase the private ownership to above 34 percent, still retaining the
government control. However, at the time of this article going to print,
the government has announced a disinvestment of another 7 percent of
VSNL's equity.

Services

As a service company, VSNL's area of operation is spread into basic
services and specialized services. And, it generates 95 percent of its
revenues from the international long distance services. The second
largest revenue earner is leased channels which contribute only 1.6
percent to the total revenue.

Under the umbrella name basic services, it has telephone services to 237
ISD destinations; telex services to 238 IXSD destinations; and telegraph
to 33 destinations.

Going by the specialized services, VSNL is into TV (programme
transmission), videoconferencing (home country direct), and
multi-address press broadcast (time and frequency transmission). Also,
it offers leased channels services such as bureaufax, T-Fax, Intelsat
business service, and Inmarsat mobile services. Its specialized services
also include Gateway Packet Data Search Transmission, Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI), On-line Data "Easynet", and E-mail (Gems 400) through
its Internet backbone.

VSNL's international gateways are two-fold. One, satellite earth
stations and two, sub-marine telephone links. The former has stations in
Arvi, Bangalore, Calcutta, Dehradun, Madras, Mumbai, and New Delhi.

In sub-marine telephone cable links, it has both wide-band sub-marine
cable analogue and digital systems. Under the wide-band sub-marine cable
analogue system, it has two gateways--Madras for IOCOM Cable to Penang
in Malaysia and Mumbai for Gulf Cable to Fujairah in UAE, with a length
of 2,509 km and 1,964 km, respectively. The digital system--SEA ME WE
2--has a length of 17,658 km, having covering points in countries such
as Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
and Sri Lanka. Mumbai is the gateway for this service. This facility was
commissioned in June 1994. The total cost involved in this was Rs 2,204
crore. As on 30 April 196, VSNL had 2,814 circuits in this service.

Coming to the mobile communication services, VSNL deals in voice, data,
and fax for the marine, air line, and land mobile communities. Its
Inmarsat mobile satellite communication services is the focal point of
all these operations.

International Association

VSNL's association with international bodies like Intelsat and Inmarsat
has enhanced its image in India and abroad, alike. It is a founder
member of Inmarsat, an organization dealing with mobile communications,
with other 77 countries, having a share of 1.48 percent in the
consortium. Similarly, in Intelsat, a set-up of 138 countries for
satellite services, too, VSNL could forge in 2.12 percent share for
India. And, in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia, VSNL is, respectively,
the tenth and eighth largest operator in the world. It also has
participation in the international joint venture ICO Global
Communications to provide global satellite private communication
services. Through VSNL, India has put in an investment of 7.38 percent
of the total project cost.

The company's association with Commonwealth Telecom Organization (CTO),
Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT), and International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) gives it an unequivocal edge. It actively participates in
the events conducted by these bodies.

It has MoUs with BT-MCI for Concert Packet Switched Services, Tele Media
International for the introduction of Universal Connect, Sprint
International, and Cable & Wireless to enhance globally managed network
and data services. Further, VSNL's success in bidding for the location
for ICO Global Satellite System's satellite access nodes gives a boost
to its international image.

By introducing Internet services on a commercial basis, VSNL has
registered a customer base of over 8,000 subscribers. It is planning to
offer companies, facilities to host home pages on the VSNL Web servers.

It is expected to further facilitate Internet usage in the country. This
service may also see tariff reduction.

The company is looking forward to participate in two sub-marine fibre
cable projects: FLAG and SEA-ME-WE-3. It also plans for laying down a
high-capacity under sea cable, linking the neighbouring countries and
providing them connectivity with other international sub-marine systems.

In the Iridium global personal satellite communications project too,
VSNL is also to participate. And, it has set up the Iridium gateway in
Pune, at a cost of Rs 50 crore. However, this will not affect its
participation in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia.

VSNL has got into the value-added services too. With Telstra, it has
formed a joint venture--Telstra V-Comm--to provide DAMA VSAT services.
Also it found a partner in Elnet, Madras, to provide domestic E-mail
services.

VSNL is, no doubt, an unchallenged entity in the international
telecommunications services at least until the year 2004. In a reformed
era too, it is a protected monopoly. However, this status does not stop
VSNL from aiming high. Quite unusual to many Indian PSUs, VSNL has a
corporate vision and it foresees changes and tries to manage such
changes well in time. It is being reiterated by its turnover of Rs 4,417
crore for 1995-96 registering 22.46 percent growth over the previous
year. Recently, the VSNL board has proposed a dividend of 45 percent.

Its present stature is mainly due to its visions and foresight than a
monopoly entity. Thanks are due to BK Syngal, the present CMD, for his
foresight and leadership. He has proven for VSNL and many PSU heads a
role model. Recently, when I met one of his senior colleagues, that
person had all praises for the CMD, quite strange in a PSU set-up.

However, this synergy could have been put to a stumbling block if he was
not given an extension. Now, Syngal will be in the driver's seat for two
more years as the government has given him an extension, recently. It
is, no doubt an acknowledgement to his contribution.

VSNL has scored in man power management too. When job attrition is a
common feature across the IT and communication industries, more so with
the arrival of MNCs. According to Amitabh Kumar, director (operations),
VSNL, through better pay packages and welfare schemes, his company could
keep its forte safely. It experienced very little man power turnover
unlike many government/autonomous entity.

Aiming high is VSNL's all time agenda. So are its strategies. VSNL is
determined to live beyond the present expectation. And, for this, Syngal
and his men are in the forefront with all good project arsenals.

RURAL TELECOM - A CHALLENGING TASK AHEAD

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Modern technologies and streamlined policies can ensure better telecom
links to rural India.

The present rural telecommunication scenario reminds me of the story of
the elephant and seven blind men. Every one views the rural
telecommunication market differently depending on which angle he is
looking at it from. Going by the sheer size of the rural population,
there should be a very sizeable demand for telephones in the rural
areas. However, as one looks at the economic conditions in these areas
and the average spending power of the population, the demand appears to
be very low. The remoteness and the geographical spread of these areas
make planning of communications a very challenging and complex task.

Modern technologies provide many solutions for the communication
requirements of the rural sector but the costs involved coupled with the
low expected returns are daunting indeed.

Some of the solutions like Wireless In Local Loop (WILL) are being
projected as the panacea for the rural telecommunications problem but
one would need an indepth study to decide whether these are economically
viable for areas with such low population density and whether it will be
possible to support these sophisticated technologies in such remote
areas unless our own people in these areas are trained to maintain these
systems after the installation teams have done their jobs and gone back
to the comforts of their highly developed countries. It is most unlikely
that even our own trained engineers/technicians will choose to serve in
the rural areas.

The government, on its part, has taken the easy way out by laying down
that the private basic service providers will have to install 10 percent
of their total capacity in the rural areas. It has also specified that
wires will not be used in the network. The basic service providers who
are, as it is, struggling hard to cope with other problems like
financing and inter-connect agreement are desperately trying to work out
how they can make their ventures profitable. Many of them are hoping
that sooner or later the government will dilute this requirement.

It is not that no one has been able to see the rural telecommunication
sector in its correct prospective. At least for the past four years or
so, a number of enlightened experts have been debating on the issues and
the complexities related to the rural telecommunication requirements.
But what is being done falls well short of the requirement.

Rural Areas: Some Basic Facts

There appears to be no formal definition of a rural area. However, BS
Murthy in his book "A Phone In Every Village" published by TRC,
Government of India, November 1987, defines the rural area as an area
where the population is less than 5,000 with a population density less
than 400 person per sq. km and with less than 75 percent of the male
population employed in the non-agricultural sector. The average
population of a village is about 1,200 and typical distances between
villages range from 3 to 10 km. A typical household in a developing
country has four to five members. Generally, a household can afford to
spend only 5 percent of its annual income on a telephone. Going by the
current rentals of telephones, this means that if a household has a
telephone and pays only the rental of Rs 2,280 per annum, it must have
an annual income of Rs 45,600. The government has a target of providing
one public telephone for every 500 people.

There are about 6.3 lakh villages in the country. Of this, only 2.16
lakh have a Village Public Telephone (VPT). There are, however, 20 lakh
telephones in the rural sector which has a population of roughly 70
crore. Thus, in the rural sector, the average number of phones is 0.3
percent against the national average of 1.2 percent of the population.

As against this, the average in the sub-urban and urban sector is 6
percent which is 20 times higher. This disparity certainly needs to be
minimized if we have to work towards achieving economic development of
our backward and rural areas. There is an outstanding requirement of
nearly 4.14 lakh VPTs. The government has plans to provide a VPT in
every village by 1997. However, its annual target for the year 1996-97
is only 75,000. It appears that the objective will not be achieved for
the next four to five years. It will take even longer to meet the target
of one public telephone for every 500 people which even by current
statistics comes to nearly 15 lakh telephones. The burden of providing
these will, therefore, shift to the private operators. They will not
find it economical to provide one in each village.

Unless cost-effective solutions are found for meeting these
requirements, it will not be financially viable for any company or even
the government to establish the requisite infrastructure.

Technology Perspective

The government is looking at a number of technological solutions to the
requirement of communications in the rural sector. Use of VSATs,
microwave equipment, ultra high frequency radio links, WILL, and
multi-access radio are some of the approaches presently being adopted.

Indeed an appropriate mix of these approaches based on the peculiarities
of the terrain and the demographics of the areas will have to be
employed to find the right solution. This is easier said than done
because of the economics of each of these technologies.

The critical factors that need to be considered while planning a network
for the rural sector are:

* Existing network architecture
* Subscriber density
* Equipment costs
* Ease of installation and use
* Power supply requirement
* Reliability, maintenance, and repair
* Growth capability of the network
* Frequency management.

As brought out earlier, subscriber density in rural areas is expected to
be low. Since the population density is less than 400 per sq. km and the
present average is 0.3 per 100, the expected density in these areas will
be less than 1.2 per sq. km.

As far as costs go, the average costs per line presently being taken for
planning purposes is Rs 40,000 per line. In the rural areas, however,
the cost is expected to be more. Many of the private operators are
working on costs of Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh per line. Ideally, the cost
should be kept below Rs 40,000.

Low power requirement, ease of repair and maintenance with remote
diagnostics and repair capability are important considerations in a
country like India. While use of solar cells is advocated as the ideal
solution for power requirement in remote areas, the cost of these
remains prohibitively high. The planning figure is roughly Rs 3 lakh per
KVA of capital investment.

Frequency management has been a serious problem in our country. There is
an on-going debate about the critical shortage in the RF spectrum for
the existing requirement of the operators of cellular, paging, and
mobile radio trunking networks. The Defence forces have been under
pressure from various government agencies to release some of the
frequencies which they are holding but not utilizing in peace time.

However, they cannot risk doing this because they cannot be assured of
the availability of the frequencies if and when required during
hostilities. With more and more technological sophistication being
introduced in our weapons, surveillance, and communication systems, the
demand for the frequency spectrum cannot possibly decrease.

Conventional Wireline

Wireline will continue to be an alternative for the subscriber loop,
although only for short distances approaching 1 km.

Satellite Communications

Remote users who are dispersed over wide areas can be served by using
satellite technologies. Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC), Multiple
Channel Per Carrier (MCPC), and VSAT technology, however, are often
expensive compared with terrestrial systems. A number of satellite
communication companies are working on solutions which will hopefully,
bring down the price of satellite communications to $500-1,000.

In larger rural communities that are far removed from major switching
centres, satellite links are effective in providing trunk circuit to
individual smaller rural switching exchanges, rather than individual
subscriber loops. A terrestrial wireless local loop system can be
integrated with low capacity satellite system, providing a
cost-effective solution.

Point To Multipoint Terrestrial Technologies

Point to Multipoint Time Division Multiple Access (PMP TDMA) is a proven
rural distribution system that finds optimum use for serving clusters of
rural subscribers, using wireless for the local loop. New features,
frequency bands, and capacities are continually being developed, with
each system optimized for specific rural needs.

Low capacity analog systems have been available for many years. Analog
multi-access systems are used primarily in isolated low capacity
applications, typically serving up to 50 subscribers from individual
radio base stations. In India, a 2/15 MAAR system, at present, costs
approximately Rs 80,000 per channel. Digital system when introduced will
cost even more though they would provide higher quality telephone
service.

Fixed Cellular And Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony

A number of companies are offering solutions based on fixed GSM, CDMA,
and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony (DECT) technologies. Trials are
being conducted by Qualcomm on CDMA in India. IIT Madras has developed a
DECT technology which promises to be cost effective though costs are not
indicated as yet. DoT has signed an MoU with National Semi Conductors of
USA for a DECT technology which it predicts will cost only Rs 500-10,000
per line. However, the subscriber density for which these costs are
applicable is not known. Thus, it would be seen that while a number of
technologies are in the offing the economics are not being clearly
projected. Hopefully, the prices will come down once the volumes are
taken into consideration and once the multinationals realize that India
may soon find its own solutions.

Need For Adopting A Pragmatic Approach

In a seminar organized by CII in December 1992, N Vittal, the then DoT
secretary, had made some very useful and practical suggestions for
improving telecommunications in the rural sector. Since then he has
expressed his views on a number of occasions through different
platforms. Some of the suggestions made by him merit serious
consideration. The main theme underlying in all his suggestions is to
remove all kinds of artificial restrictions that are presently imposed,
i.e. * Only one additional service provider for basic services in each
circle * VSATs are not permitted to be connected to PSTN network *
Dedicated networks of major organization like Railways, Defence, NTPC,
and ONGC cannot be shared by any of the private service providers. They
can only use DoT's infrastructure * Only specified technologies approved
by DoT can be deployed by private service providers.

Each of these restrictions hampers growth of the telecommunication
infrastructure. Another suggestion which he had made in 1992 was to
channelize the black money (and there is plenty of it in the country)
into developing the rural telecommunication infrastructure.

It is very heartening to see that the present government has laid
special emphasis on developing the rural infrastructure in its Common
Minimum Programme. The allocation for the rural infrastructure in the
9th Plan has been increased from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore. It
is now for the telecommunication fraternity as a whole to grab the
opportunities presented by the rural telecommunication market, taking
the long-term benefits, both for the nation and the telecommunication
business, into consideration.

Fixed cellular

Using fixed cellular instead of copper wire to connect homes and offices
has several advantages.

* Speed of installation. Subscribers can be connected immediately
when supplied with an antenna unit that connects to an ordinary telephone
* Low maintenance. The absence of wires means fewer potential problems
than are found with wire-based networks in both rural and urban environments
* Flexibility. Fixed cellular can be used as an interim measure ahead of
fixed network construction, with the radio equipment transferred to
another location once the fixed network has been established.

Maitland report

A document entitled the "Missing Link" produced in 1984 by an
international commission headed by Sir Donald Maitland lays down the UN
Policy towards telecommunications development.

In January 1995, a proposal of the 1984 Maitland Commission to create
World Tel, a specialized funding body for telecommunications development
in the world's poorest countries, was finally given the go-ahead. To
some, it represents the last chance for significant progress in this
area during for the foreseeable future. This body is now headed by Sam
Pitroda who pioneered the spread of telecommunications to the rural
areas in India.

Distorted economics

It is generally argued by most basic service providers that providing
services in rural areas is going to be a loss-making proposition for
them. However, their projections may be some what exaggerated with a
view to seek subsidies from the government. A number of factors support
this view.

* Modern technology offers cheaper alternatives to physically
wiring up every remote customer. These products are more reliable and so
require less maintenance. Maintenance costs in rural areas are lower
than those in city environments where carrying out repairs can involve
complex and disruptive work beneath busy streets. City networks are also
more likely to be damaged by other utilities while digging up the
streets
* Methods of calculating the per subscriber costs and revenue in
rural areas often disregard revenue generated by incoming calls made to
rural users.

ENHANCED SERVICES A CUT ABOVE THE REST

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Through enhanced services, operators are trying to differentiate
themselves from their parallels.

Today, one can find more than one operator available for any kind of a
telecom service. Be it cellular, paging, or yet-to-be-privatized basic
telephony. The subscribers remaining the same, the question is who will
eat a bigger chunk of the service pie. With competition getting hotter
day-by-day, the operators of different telecom networks are striving to
prove their edge over others. Others, who are out in the arena providing
something similar. One sure way out has been providing enhanced services
or value-added services, as some prefer to call it.

To the delight of the operators, enhanced services can be integrated
smoothly, without any major changes in the installed networks.

Technically also, these support virtually all network interfaces, all
current protocols, and standards including those specific to particular
countries. Thus protecting any investments already made, which is a
major issue in any technology upgradation. And in the interest of the
common user, for whom all this translates into better connectivity and
true value for money.

Market For Enhanced Services

DoT had started the car phone service and even the paging service long
back. But it turned out be a total fiasco, as the public gave it a cold
shoulder. Not that these services were not good technically or
otherwise, as they are now, but all because of the lack of an emphatic
marketing savvy and mass awareness. DoT was, and still seems to be
oblivious of the fact that the first phase in selling anything is the
market development. And that comes through educating the customers, by
reaching them, and telling what it is. Indian Paging Service Association
(IPSA) is promoting and selling the concept of paging in a mega way. "In
fact, there are numerous enhanced services that can be provided along
with the routine paging service. But it is unnecessary to inundate the
market and confuse the customers. Educating the people should be given
the priority," says Praveen Kumar, president, IPSA. Essar Cellphone in
Delhi has come up with "Personalized Services" to attract the
subscribers. According to company officials, it is like having a
personal secretary working for you, outside your office, round the
clock. AirTel, too, hasn't lagged behind in jumping into the bandwagon.

It all started with flashing of cricket scores on pagers during the
World Cup 96. Even, AirTel had introduced a special number service to
keep the cellphone users updated with the latest in the action-packed
matches. And, when the election fever was on a high, the latest
standings were continuously being flashed by some of the paging
operators. Soon one will see the operators providing more such
information. "The sensex and forex update will take some time to be on
the air round-the-clock. But the paging operators are giving a serious
thought at providing other value-added information, for instance, stock
market briefings, airline schedules, railway time tables, etc.," feels
OP Suri, senior vice-president (operations), DSS Mobile Communications,
a Delhi-based paging operator.

"These will surely go a long way in developing the market and will, in a
way, benefit the individual operators also to lure the subscribers,"
adds he.

Roaming arrangements between the various cellular and paging operators
is also becoming quite popular. Recently, nine cellular operators, four
from metros and five from the yet-to-be operational state circles, have
come together to form "World 1 Network". This is to provide efficient
roaming between their respective territories. The cellphone user can do
with a single SIM card, without having to go for separate ones, as in
plastic roaming. "Follow Me Paging" introduced by RPG is in association
with Motorola's Hotline Paging. You can be paged locally, within the
city you are visiting. And that too, at the cost of a local call. And
surprisingly, nothing changes even your pager number remains the same.

Voicemail is just one of the enhanced services that the operators
provide these days, but it is catching on very fast as compared to other
enhancements. Not only the cellular operators but paging operators are
also in an endeavor to incorporate it into their networks. Mobilink has
become the first service to provide Voicemail facility on pagers. It is
also providing vernacular messaging in three languages--Hindi, Punjabi,
and Tamil."Interestingly, enhanced services can be introduced at a cost,
which is just 1-2 percent of the total cost required to lay a telecom
network.

Some players in the field providing these enhanced services are Boston
Technology, Brite, Centigram, Comverse, Glenyare, and Octel," says Bonny
Singh, manager (telecom), IIS Infotech. His company has been appointed
as a master distributor in India by Boston Technology Inc., a leader in
these services world-wide. The personalized services for Essar have been
integrated into their network by Comverse, Israel.

How can enhanced services change the lifestyle of an Indian on the move.
Let us take a closer look at these new offerings that are and can be
made available to the Indian users.

Virtual Telephone: In many regions around the world, the demand for
basic telephone outstrips the connections being provided. And India is
no exception to this situation. Virtual telephone, a yet-to-be exploited
service seems to be the answer. It is like having a telephone connection
at your place, without physically having an instrument. Though it is not
the panacea for all the connectivity problems.

It is an efficient tool for reaching out people living in:
areas with poor customer access network those on long waiting list for the
telephone service those in areas struck by natural disasters, causing
disruptions in the infrastructure and small businesses who need 24-hour
messaging capability.

A 7-10 digit number is assigned to the subscribers of the virtual
telephone service. This offers them access to a private and secure voice
messaging mailbox. It is just like dialing a conventional telephone. The
caller hears a greeting or a specific message, pre-recorded by the
subscriber whenever he dials into the network. Subscribers can access
the mailbox through a payphone and retrieve their messages anytime. A
key feature that can be added is the ability to provide timely
notification to the subscriber, when they have messages waiting for
retrieval. The message centre at the network can automatically alert the
subscriber via a pager, if programmed to do so.

Voice Mail Service (VMS): Based on electronic voice messaging technique,
this service is available to the users through our very own MTNL. It
provides for recording, storing, and retrieval of voice messages. The
voice is first digitized and then stored in an Electronic Voice Mail Box
(EVMB), which actually is a memory space in the disc of custom-designed
central computer of the VMS. For recording the voice messages, these
EVMBs can be accessed by anyone--whether he is a VMS customer or
not--anytime through a direct telephone (local or long distance) and
extensions of PABXes (through junction lines). For retrieval, however,
bonafide customers of VMS only can access their individual EVMBs through
the use of a secret Personal Identification Number (PIN), which can be
selected and changed by the customer at his will.

Optional facilities that are bundled with the VMS are:

- incoming calls to a number, served by an electronic exchange, can be
  transferred to any other telephone and also to any EVMB
- restricting the access to selected callers only, by giving a secret
  password to them
- choice of an EVMB number
- quick scan of beginning of all messages
- elective retrieval of all messages
- redirect messages (with or without comment) to other EVMBs
- broadcasting voice messages to several mail boxes
  closed user group.

Call Answering: With today's fast-paced work and leisure schedules,
people demand the ability to capture messages from incoming calls,
whenever they are away from their home or office. And this is surely
going to give the answering machine market a big blow. It is like a
separate answering machines for each subscriber fitted into the network.

But in real, there is no machine present physically. It is the network
which does it all. It is like your personal secretary, working
round-the-clock for you, outside your office, claim some of the cellular
operators who provide this service.

Enhanced services can be integrated smoothly, without any major changes
in the installed networks.

The subscribers are allotted an EVMB which can gather the incoming
messages when the line is busy or remains unattended for a certain
specified duration. With the touch of a button, the callers can:

- mark a message urgent (which places it into the high priority queue)
- review a message
- re-record a message
- cancel the message completely.

Once the subscriber logs into his EVMB, he can with a simple keystroke:

* listen to all messages
* listen to selected messages skipping others
* pause while listening to a message
* go back or move forward while listening to a message
* save or delete messages
* check the time and date of message deposit.

Submailbox: This allows the subscribers to create several mailboxes for
a single telephone line. Many people/ departments can share a phone line
and still enjoy the privacy of a personal EVMB.

Call Hold/Waiting: This facility lets you receive incoming calls even
when your telephone is busy. You get a short duration pip tone when you
are busy talking, indicating that another call is waiting for you. You
can talk to either of the callers, keeping the other on hold. There is
complete secrecy of communication between the two callers. In Essar's
network, the service helps the subscriber to handle three calls at the
same time, without any of them getting the engaged tone. The subscriber
has the freedom of attending calls at his own priority.

The basic telephony will soon get privatized. With the cellular and the
paging networks getting operational in state-wide circles along with
major cities, the industry will witness a burgeoning demand for these
enhanced services. By the present operators and the operators-to-be. In
a stride, to add more names to their subscriber database, and make their
services more feature-rich, what these operators will end-up doing is to
make life easier for the end-user.

GSM Networks-associated Enhanced Services:

Short Message Service:

This is a text messaging function for use in digital wireless network.

The caller composes a brief text message that is delivered to the
subscriber's properly equipped wireless handset. It can be configured to
take messages through an operator or via a voice menu. This facility
helps your cellphone to double as pager by giving you an option to send
or receive messages in a written form. Thereby, circumventing the need
of unnecessary conversation specially when the incoming calls are also
being charged.

Roaming: It is specially designed for people who frequently travel to
other cities. You can be reached anywhere, if your operator has an
arrangement with the operator of that place.

Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP): A characteristic of the
Intelligent Networks. The caller's number gets displayed on the LCD
screen before the subscriber answers the call. If the phone is connected
to the local computer and some memory augmentation is done, the computer
can display a scroll of information about the caller, before the
subscriber attends the call.

Calling Line Identification Restriction: The calling subscriber can
prevent his number being presented on the called subscriber's phone
(prevention of CLIP). However, it will be overridden by certain agencies
such as police and fire, since they need to know the identity of the
caller.

Advice Of Charge: The amount charged for the call can get displayed on
the subscriber's phone screen in the form of call units.

Call Transfer/Call Forward: The call can be routed to another specified
number or even an EVMB conditionally, if the called subscriber is not
available (or doesn't answer the call). This can be facilitated after
few rings or directly without any wait.

Paging-associated Enhanced Services

Twin Line service: A business line and a personal line number is given
to the subscriber opting for it. To separate the business messages from
the personal ones.

Sequential Numbering: All messages are sequentially numbered allowing
the subscribers to have a control on the messages missed.

Reminder Service: You can remind yourself appointment/ schedules for the
day or future dates by getting yourself paged from the operator of the
paging service.

Special Instructions: Special instructions can be given to the operator
to convey to your callers, anything which you decide. This could be for
instance change of your telephone number/address or for that matter your
being out of station.

Time And Date Stamping: These tell the subscriber when and on what date
the message was sent to them.

Priority Paging: The messages can be prioritized by jumping the queue
and thus can be entertained on an out-of-turn basis by the operator.

Repeat Paging: The subscriber can ask the operator for being paged twice
everytime, to be doubly sure.

MOBILE SATELLITE SYSTEMS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Call them PSMNs--Public Skyline Mobile Networks. Mobile Satellite
Systems, MSSes for short, promise to change the way all of us live.
Communication does miracles. It brings people closer. For a change, it
is now bringing satellites closer, to earth. Yes, communication
satellites today do not necessarily mean INSATs and INTELSATs, revolving
at an altitude of 35,000 km. They are now closer to us; much smaller,
and of course, much smarter. Soon, they will be crowding the skies.

By the turn of the century, more than a hundred of them would be
orbiting around the earth. Above a distance of as low as 400 km. These
are called the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, to distinguish them
from the traditional communication satellites like INSAT and INTELSAT,
often called geostationary satellites. Then, there are satellites that
can be placed at a distance of between 8,000 and 11,000 km, with similar
kind of functionalities. Placed between the high orbit geostationary and
low-orbit LEO satellites, these are expectedly called Medium Earth Orbit
(MEO) satellites.

MSSes are constellations of LEOs or MEOs aiming to provide mobile
communication services to millions of users around the globe. Most of
these systems will be operational by a time as early as mid-1998. At
least, seven such systems have been promised by different consortia.
Three of them are being talked about, simply because they have already
got the FCC approval in the US. Iridium is a 66-LEO project of a
consortium led by Motorola. Globalstar is a 48-LEO project to be jointly
put by Loral and Qualcomm, with different companies having service
rights for different regions. ICO is a 12-MEO project by an Inmarsat
subsidiary company. All the three are expected to be operational by
1998.

The others are Odyssey, a 12-MEO project; and Aries, a 48-LEO project
and Ellipso, a 24-satellite (combination of LEOs and MEOs) project.
Odyssey, though not in a very advanced stage of planning and
fund-raising, and the other two, deferred by FCC, also hope to start
operation in the same time frame as the FCC-approved systems. Then,
there is the grand plan by two celebrities--Craig McCaw and Bill
Gates--to start Teledesic, a project involving 840 (No, the figure is
not a printing mistake) LEO satellites to provide broadband services.

But they are talking of a time frame of beyond the year 2000. But that
is another century.

Why Not Geostationary Satellites?

The answer requires a bit of techspeak. Because, the LEOs and MEOs, as
such, are a breakthrough in satellite technology. They are not an
upgradation of the geostationary satellites. They are altogether a
different technology, belonging to a newer generation. To talk of mobile
satellite systems, without talking technology, is a mistake, to use a
mild word.

First, what necessitated the change ...

There is something called the Clarke Orbit (some also call it the Clarke
Belt). Perhaps, you know about it. For those who do not, it is an orbit
in the space about 35,860 km above the equator where the period of
revolution of an object is roughly 24 hours, the same amount of time
that the earth takes to revolve around itself. A satellite, which is
placed there, can maintain a constant elevation and angle from a
particular point on the earth, always. In other words, it appears
stationary to that particular point. Hence, the name geostationary. All
the geostationary satellites are placed in the Clarke Orbit.

But what is the problem? It is something that we Indians are very
familiar with. Excess population, that is. Clarke Orbit is just one
orbit at a single altitude. Satellites are many. So there can be what is
called "crowding". There is, of course, no possibility of physical
collision or congestion. Because, even a spacing of two degrees is
actually a distance of about 1,300 km in the Clarke Orbit. The problem,
however, is that the antennas on the ground fail to discriminate among
satellites, if they are too close in the sky, for all practical
purposes, two to four degrees. That means, there cannot be more than 180
satellites, even if we assume a two degree space.

LEOs and MEOs, on the other hand, do not have to operate at a fixed
orbit. They can be placed anywhere between altitudes of 400 to 10,000
km. So, we have no orbit constraint. Hence, no crowding. No problems for
antennas on the ground. If tomorrow, there is a need to add new
satellites, or to launch a completely new system, that can be done
without pains.

Another fact that works in favour of LEOs and MEOs is what is called the
inverse square law for signal power. According to this, a signal in
space attenuate in direct proportion to the square of the distance it
travels. The lower the altitude of a satellite orbit, lower is the
required transmitting power for a signal. Of course, there is an
alternative--that of using large antennas. But, that is also not an
attractive proposition. LEOs and MEOs, which are at a lower altitude,
require less power while using smaller antennas.

The LEOs also offer another advantage. There is negligible transmission
delay as the distance travelled by a call using an LEO is several times
lower than the same using a geostationary satellite. This means, for
mobile communications, which is predominantly voice communications, they
are better. The final deciding factor is, of course, cost of satellites
and the cost of launch. LEOs are much cheaper.

Why MSS?

Landline cellular networks do have certain limitations. Most of the
times, you are deprived of a communication link where you need it
most--in villages, rural roads, forests, and such remote locations. It
is uneconomical for any landline cellular operator to cover these
places. Mobile satellite services expand the service territory to cover
the entire world. "It is like having base stations in the sky," explains
Ming Louie, vice-president, Globalstar.

Put simply, MSSes are LEO and MEO satellite constellations that will
provide mobile voice and data communication facilities the world over.
Since an LEO or an MEO can cover much less geographical area than a
geostationary satellite, usually more satellites are used to provide
global connectivity. MSS satellites will be revolving around the entire
earth, which means any point on the earth will be covered by at least
one satellite. The advantage is that low altitude, high altitude areas,
as well as the seas will now be the coverage area of telecommunications.

MSS service will provide a cost-effective way for extending the reach of
basic telecom operators. Laying cables and even microwave links to
remote low subscriber locations is not only costlier, but also time
consuming. MSS connectivity is instant. It is connectivity on demand.

This connectivity-on-demand is beneficial even to the cellular
operators. By collaborating with an MSS operator, they can effectively
tackle the occasional demand in certain locations. Examples include
tourist and pilgrimage spots. Haridwar will have at least hundred times
more demand during Kumbh Mela than that during normal days. So will be
Puri during Rath Yatra. No cellular operator will be able to meet that
kind of differentials in demand. That is not a problem for satellites.
And, of course, they will get a ready back-up network, thus reducing
dropped calls and enhancing service quality.

It is like having base stations in the sky

Residents of rural and unserved areas will gain access to a telephone
courtesy MSS services. DoT has this ambitious plan of covering all the
villages in next three years. Estimates show, the cost involved will be
enormous as the task is almost impossible. Enter MSS and the village
public phones will be there, as and when required.

The last segment of users--the most important from the MSS operators'
point of view--are the international business travellers, the creamy
layer. With globalization, the population of this tribe has gone up
considerably. For cellular operators, using MSS services for serving
them is a better option than using roaming with other operators because
the complexities of revenue sharing can be much less in the former.

Iridium Vs Globalstar

But why only Iridium and Globalstar?

On 31 January 1995, FCC in the US allowed three of the five
applicants--Iridium, led by Motorola Inc.; Globalstar LP, promoted by
Loral and Qualcomm; and Odyssey by TRW while deferring two
others--Mobile Communication Holding's Ellipso and Constellation Com
munications' Constellation. In addition to this, there is an
international consortium, Inmarsat's ICO. So we have four projects that
are rolling on at present.

The reasons behind talking about Iridium and Globalstar are primarily,
two. They will become operational at least six months before any other
such project. Two, we are interested in India more than we are in FCC
licences or the meetings of corporate bigwigs in Los Angeles. And
Iridium and Globalstar have been most active in India (more about that
latter).

The fact that both these projects are LEO satellite-based is merely
incidental.

Iridium is pioneering. The idea of using LEOs for MSS first came to
scientists at Motorola's satellite communication division in Chandler,
Arizona. Motorola was also the first to approach the FCC for licensing
Iridium. Globalstar came latter, but now is giving good competition to
Iridium.

Iridium provides total coverage. Iridium with 66 satellites provides
total global coverage, whereas Globalstar covers only 70 degree S to 70
degree N. It excludes the poles from its coverage area.

Globalstar has low system cost. Globalstar has managed to keep its total
system cost low by using less number of satellites. Globalstar's total
system cost is $1.8 billion as compared to Iridium's $3.4 billion.
Funding, hence, won't be a problem for Globalstar.

Tariff: Globalstar wins outright. Globalstar, because of its lower
system cost, plans to provide the service at a tariff of 30 cents per
minute which is several times lower than Iridium's tariff of $3 per
minute. The Gobalstar price will be slightly higher (about 50 cents)
when it reaches the customer as the local partner will also have his
share.

Iridium uses 66 LEO satellites at an altitude of 780 km, with
intersatellite links. Irdium offers total global coverage

Prime targets are different. Though business travellers are the target
for both Iridium and Globalstar, the latter puts emphasis on developing
nations as well. This is understandable as the tariff of Globalstar can
be afforded in these countries. This is something that Iridium needs to
really worry about. The international business travellers will also need
high-speed data communication. Teledesic may also target this elite
market. As of today, the Teledesic plan is for fixed services. But with
840 satellites, mobility can be added to system with marginal
incremental cost. That will create problems for Iridium. Iridium should
either plan for broadband to directly compete with Teledesic or could
build up a loyal user base for paging. Or try both. There is no fourth
way. Perhaps, it will do that once it makes some quick revenues.

Iridium, despite large system cost, will break-even fast. Motorola,
because of its brand equity, will attract major business users. And
these are the people who will use the system more. Iridium, hence will
make much better revenue, even if Globalstar gives it a run for its
money as far as number of subscribers is concerned. That means Iridium
can plan for next phase better.

Globalstar uses technology better. Though better technology usage does
not necessarily mean better revenue, it helps. Globalstar does not use
complex inter-satellite links and keeps the entire intelligence on
ground. This will be the trend of tomorrow as this helps one to have
better control on the system.

Globalstar uses CDMA technology. CDMA is proving its superiority in
terrestrial cellular and PCS. In satellite communication, it is even
better. TDMA, being used by Iridium, requires exclusive command of the
spectrum while offering less capacity. No wonder, almost all the MSS
service hopefuls, with the exception of Iridium, are planning to use
CDMA. Iridium was finalized when CDMA was still in labs.

The Indian Scene

India is never the same as the rest of the world. MSS services are no
exception. While the rest of the world is thinking of LEOs and MEOs,
India has provisionally approved an MSS proposal using a geostationary
satellite. And, it is the only MSS proposal approved so far.

The $850 million project by Afro-Asian Satellite Communication (ASC), a
Gibralatar-based company, owned by Zee TV owner Subhash Chandra, plans
to use a geostationary satellite to cover India and 53 other countries
in the region which come under the satellite's footprint. It plans to
launch the satellite in third quarter of 1998 and start the service soon
afterwards. While transmission delay and large power requirements make
present generation geostationary satellites unsuitable for mobile
communication, a technology breakthrough may well be able to do that. A
Price Waterhouse forecast says that mobile communication with hand-held
units will become commercially available by the year 2000. Chandra plans
to do that at least a year earlier.

Inmarsat, through VSNL, has also publicized its plan to start the ICO
service by 1999. VSNL will be the local partner in services in this
project which will spend $37 million for equipment in the first phase.

But VSNL is yet to start promotional activities for ICO.

Globalstar uses 48 LEO satellites at an altitude of 1,390 km. All the
intelligence in the system is kept on the ground. There is no
intersatellite link.

In contrast, Iridium started selling the concept in mid-1995. Indian FIs
have contributed as much as $38 million to the project. That is 5
percent equity. Iridium India Telecom Pvt Ltd, as the investing company
is called, has contributions from various Indian FIs through IL & FS.
Others are IDBI, Exim Bank of India, SBI, ICICI, HDFC, GIC, LIC, and
UTI, among others.

What will help Iridium is that these FIs will use their clout to make
the venture successful. Motorola's brand equity will also help.

Globalstar, though it came much latter, has already opened up an Indian
joint venture. The company will have 51 percent share held jointly by
Crompton Greaves and Pertech Computers Ltd while the rest 49 percent
will be owned by Hyundai-led Hyundai/Dacom. Hyundai holds the Globalstar
service rights for this region. Globalstar plans to invest Rs 4,300
crore in India during the next few years. Globalstar's partners could be
the cellular service providers. Last August, Globalstar organized a
technical forum in the capital and it was one of the most well attended
forums in recent months. At least, two cellular operators are having
serious talks with Globalstar India and are waiting for government
approvals. Globalstar's strategy of co-operating with local operators
and the low tariff may give it an upper hand. But FIs still have a hold
in the industry and they have invested heavily in Iridium. That could be
a hurdle for Globalstar.

As far as Odyssey is concerned, this writer is not aware of any
activities of the company in India.

Unto The Future

A Price Waterhouse forecast says Odyssey will form a joint venture with
one of the other three consortia and additional joint ventures and
partnerships will be formed by all of the LEO groups. That is true. The
market is big. But never so big to embrace all those who rush in.
The real thing to watch is Teledesic's entry. Bill Gates has never done
anything that is not helpful to growth of personal computers in one way
or the other. Teledesic could be his latest way of ensuring his
objective. With 840 LEO satellites, it could change the whole balance of
the MSS market. And the rules of the game. But the big question: will he
finally go for M, mobility that is? The answer to that question can
determine what MSS scenario will be in the year 2010. That could be a
different story altogether. Watch this space.

MSS: For Whom?

Telecom operators seeking low-cost service expansion to remote areas
Cellular operators seeking low-cost service expansion to low-subscriber
areas of only periodic demand

Residents of rural areas seeking basic telephone service
Businesses needing cellular services globally.

NIIT - THE WINGS ARE MANY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

In today's world of competition, only the fittest can boast of its
presence, and NIIT clearly marks its way to IT.

There had been many institutions imparting education on IT that are
coming up with high promises of success. The National Institute of
Information Technology, or NIIT as it is popularly known, is the oldest
among them all. A part of HCL Corp., ever since it started in 1981, it
brought a sea-change in the Indian IT education scenario. For the first
time, professional courses apart from medicine or engineering or law
came into being. And for the better.

Going back to 1981, when it came into being, education was the first
motive of this institution. Then it diversified to fields of training,
consultancy, software marketing, and software exports. In 1995, the
scenario changed. With the government's liberalization policy coming in
the air, the need for going global arose. And the international division
was set up.

Apart from these, software export factories were set up aimed at
providing entire software solutions to its clients that includes setting
up of the network too.

Today, NIIT is virtually into every aspect of IT. And telecom. Many
tie-ups are taking place. NIIT is diversifying and so are the areas of
education in infotech. Be it software solutions, network integration, or
Internet training, it can boast of its expertise in many areas.

The level of expansion is so high that lately the sales training
division of the institution, NIS had to be separated as an entirely
different entity. Now called NIS Sparta, the company has emerged as a
joint venture with Team Productivity, a specialist in imparting training
in sales and marketing. The other four strategic business units include
the Global Education and Training, Global Software Solutions, Global
Software Products, and Multimedia.

In the field of training, it has formed alliances with four companies:
3Com; AT&T Network Systems, now under Lucent Technologies; Microsoft
Corp.; and NETG Applied Learning.

World leaders in computer and communications software are finding India
as the green pasture to venture. And NIIT is the easy solution for them.

For it already has the second largest share in the software market in
India. The organization, already awarded with ISO 9001, international
quality certification, has little to say for its introduction.

The tie-up between NIIT and AT&T has created waves. By recognizing the
area of telecommunications as one of the thrust areas, the alliance aims
at offering training in telecom to the Indians. This includes all,
ranging from the basics to the advanced courses. And NIIT being the
Indian training associate of AT&T completes the process. A programme on
networking education is now being provided with the tie-up with 3Com
under the brand name of Centre for Network Excellence (CNE). Hence, the
total range of education from datacom to telecom is now being made
available.

Companies like Microsoft also has had an understanding with NIIT in
imparting knowledge on Microsoft technologies under the curriculum of
GNIIT programme. For this, it has got the college credit recommendations
from American Council of Education (ACE). NIIT alumnae can seek
exemptions on certain modules in the US universities on the basis of
credits. This programme provides education on Windows NT, Microsoft
BackOffice, Internet products, and Networking. NIIT itself is a major
user of the latest communication tools like videoconferencing, intranet,
and the like.

Apart from these, NIIT is also into varied IT fields like consultancy
and systems integration. In the field of software, it has formed
alliances with major companies which include Sybase Inc., Powersoft
Corp., Ansys Inc., Mentor Graphics, and Mechanical Dynamics.

It has entered into an alliance with Cincom Systems, USA, to provide
enterprise resource application software suite called Control. The main
clients among the communications company using the application are
Alcatel, Ericsson, Hitachi Semiconductor, Siemens, GEC Alsthom, and
Philips. The advanced functionality of Control is insulated with a
3-schema client/server design and is available in multiple platforms
including IBM, DEC, HP, and multiple databases that include Oracle,
Supra, Sybase, and Informix.

Ross Systems Inc. is another US company joining hands with NIIT. This
time, it is to provide the business application software suite of Ross
Systems called Renaissance CS. It is fully integrated open systems based
client/server solution designed from the ground up for process
manufacturing organization like food processing, pharmaceuticals, paper,
and chemicals.

Powersoft Corp., the subsidiary of global software major Sybase, has
tied up with NIIT to provide PowerBuilder 5.0, client/server application
development tool and Optima++ for building Internet applications. NIIT
is the sole distributor of Sybase products in India. Sybase provides
technical solutions to NIIT.

The organization that has been growing the day it had started from seems
to agree with the same old saying that Darwin meant many years ago--
Survival Of The Fittest. On asking the main motive behind NIIT's
presence in telecom education, Sanjiv Kataria, vice-president, corporate
communication, replied, "If we would not have got there, we would have
been dead by now. Today, is the era of Net Centric Computing (NCC) ... And
networking is the key to any business."

VSNL - TO EURO OR NOT

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

To raise funds and fructify its vision, VSNL does need to go the GDR
way.

Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the Rs 4,417 crore India's
international communications carrier, has been trying to float its
Euro-issue for the past two years now. But its attempts have been
thwarted for one reason or the other.

The ministry of finance is drawing up a list of companies for immediate
disinvestment. The list includes some telecom majors and VSNL could be
one of them. The impact of this disinvestment will be negative if VSNL
has to float its GDR before the end of this year.

Post-disinvestment, the floating stock will increase. This will lead to
dilution of the share price and will ultimately affect the pricing of
VSNL's GDR issue. Further, the chances of getting an attractive price
are also doubtful because of the queue-up of other international telecom
majors. Large number of telecom companies from the US, Europe, and Asia
have firmed up plans for GDR issues totalling over $30 billion.

The first time, VSNL tried to float GDR in May 1994, the share price
fell from Rs 1,550 to Rs 1,200. The issue had to be deferred due to
depressed international equity market conditions and the stiffening of
interest rates. In the second attempt, the share price fell further to
Rs 1,050 and the issue was deferred due to delays in obtaining final
clearances from the government. So goes the VSNL's GDR saga. The
prospects looked even bleak with the impending retirement of BK Syngal,
CMD, VSNL. Even the financial advisor, Anne Morris who had witnessed the
earlier deferrals has also moved out. At the time of this article going
to print, the government has announced another 7 percent disinvestment
of VSNL's equity. And, the Telecom Commission has extended Syngal's
tenure for two more years. A real respite.

Does VSNL really require this GDR? How is VSNL positioned now? Well ...

It is placed in a comfortable position presently. Not because it is the
sole provider of international telecom services, but because it has been
able to build on its own success and vision. It might be a little known
fact that VSNL has the second highest rate of returns on equity--at 38.5
percent, just three points below Advance Info, Thailand.

VSNL has been operating independent of budgetary allocations by
ploughing money back into projects for building, maintaining, and
expanding its services. However, VSNL's profit percentage is quite low
despite being the sole service provider. This is mainly due to the fact
that the company's profit structure is solely determined by what it owes
to DoT. DoT charges each caller Rs 62.50 per minute and VSNL's income
out of this is just between Rs 4 and 7 per minute. Due to this, its
outgoing traffic has remained almost static as compared to the past.

Because, it is cheaper to call India rather than calling from India due
to falling bandwidth costs abroad. Is this an index of growth?
Definitely not.

Luckily, DoT seems to be acquiescing with global trends in telecom
tariffs. Since 1995, it has announced a 25 percent concession on
outgoing calls between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Even for the Internet
services, VSNL doubled up its 250 hours of access per year to 500 hours
per year.

In anticipation of growth in outgoing traffic, VSNL has been
consistently and aggressively expanding its call-carrying capacity. From
2,109 in 1991, it rose to 11,525 in 1995. And the target that VSNL has
set for itself in the next few years is 35,000. During this period, the
paid telephone circuits increased two-and-a-half times.

The target does not seem to the farfetched, because with falling
tariffs, traffic is going to explode. Together with this are emerging
applications like software exports, videoconferencing, and ISDN, to name
a few. Apart from increase in call-carrying capacity, the lines have to
be high-speed lines. Thousands of switches and fibre-optic links need to
be put up to achieve this milestone. And, this cannot be done by
retained cash-flow alone. Therefore, VSNL does need to go the GDR way.

It would be better if VSNL floats its GDR without much further delay. It
will enjoy the status of being the sole service provider for six more
years ... By that time, VSNL should have become a global telco to reckon
with. It needs to reach an enviable position that might even help the
company to get its sole provider status extended.

MADRAS - CELLULAR OR SERVICES

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Better coverage, low call-drop, and roaming? Or interpreter assistance,
information services, and hospital emergency services? The two cellular
operators in Madras have different priorities for offering to the
customer.

Is providing cellular phone service a part of the telecom industry or
the service industry as a whole? This seems to be a major bone of
contention between the two cellular operators providing the service in
the city of the Madras. While one swears that it is undoubtedly a part
of the service segment, the other refutes it vehemently. Caught in this
war of words are Skycell Communications Ltd and RPG Cellular Services
Ltd.

"We are not a telecom industry but a service one. We are all cellular
service providers and should aim at offering more services," says Ramesh
K Narain, Senior Manager, Sales, Skycell Communications. In line with
this thought, Skycell has recently started offering a number of services
such as hospital emergency service, interpreter assistance, wake up call
facility, etc.

Justifying these host of facilities, Narain says, "The subscriber should
get a more complete service from us when he pays a hefty amount and that
is what we offer." In his opinion, people have understood the need for a
cellular phone and their realization should be valued more by offering
such additional services. "This business is no longer concept selling.
People have started to feel the need and are coming to us now," says he.

But RPG Cellular Services, the second service provider operating in
Madras has a different angle to the entire story. Shashi Kumar Kalathil,
general manager, marketing, RPG Cellular Services, dismissing the
service concept, says, "We are undoubtedly in telecom. Value addition in
cellular could only refer to voice-mail and data transfer facilities.
The rest of them whatever they be, are not value-added in classic
parlance."

The company argues that the effectiveness of the service should be
measured more in terms of the capability of the frequency signals and
not in other service packages. RPG's stance is understandable, given
that it does not offer any value-added services. Instead, it has been
harping on its wide network ever since its started operations with 24
base stations. It does claim to have the larger subscriber base of the
two.

"It is the coverage that matters", says Kalathil. Currently, it has a
total of 31 base stations and his company plans to add 10 more in the
event of a spurt in demand. This move, however, will depend on the
traffic, according to Kalathil. In his opinion, the number of base
stations need to be increased only if either the profile of the city
changes with the migration of a section of people or if the need for
greater coverage inside the buildings in a particular area arises.

Skycell is not too far behind on the base station front. It has 22 base
stations in place and plans to add 10 more by the end of October. "With
this and the new services, Skycell will surely garner about 57 percent
of the total market before the end of March 1997," avers Ramesh.

The subscribers in Madras, unmindful of the wordy duel of whether
cellular is a part of service or telecom segment, seem to have responded
to the new concept. They are not unduly excited at the availability of
such varied services though. "All these could be more of a marketing
gimmick of each of the organization," says Rekha, a business executive
working in a multinational firm in Madras. Their one overriding concern
is the high airtime charges. "Whatever it is, all that I am more
concerned with is my phone bill. Hence, I obviously use it with great
prudence," says Hari Krishnan, a cost conscious business man in
possession of a cellular phone for the past six months. "I still do not
give my cell number to everyone I know," says he.

Despite these reservations, the number of cellular subscribers in Madras
has been growing steadily. Though subscriber base has fallen short of
expectations, the numbers are not way behind projections. According to
estimates put out a year ago by the two players, Madras was to have a
subscriber base of 22,000 by the end of September 1996, the first
anniversary of cellular service in the city. Currently it is at
18,264--a 17 percent shortfall. Of the total subscriber base of 18,264
customers, Skycell claims a base of 8,994 and RPG boasts of 9,270
customers (as on 10 September 1996).

The gradual popularity of the service has motivated the operators to
introduce the concept of using cellular phones on a rental basis. "This
is mainly for those people who have a need to use a cellular phone but
are still not ready to buy one," says Kalathil. "Rent-a-Cellular"
concept is a fairly new service introduced just over a month ago and the
success of the concept still remains to be seen.

Whether the operators finally settle their differences or not, the price
conscious market of Madras has shaped up well, as per the business
plans. And this is perhaps the only area where the two operators agree
whole heartedly. "This is because this time the customers were not
budget-sensitive," say both the operators.

MRTP ACT - CAN IT LATCH DOT'S WINGS?

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

DoT has recently been brought under the purview of MRTP Act. The
question is which DoT? The service provider or policy maker?
The National Telecom Policy 1994 signalled a shift from culture of
monopoly to that of competition in telecom services. Competition, if not
fair, is Jungle law. At the same time, protection of consumer interest
is the ultimate objective. MRTP Commission's decision to include DoT
under its purview is, hence, a welcome step.

In July 1996, the two-member bench of the MRTP Commission consisting
Sardar Ali and S Chakravarthy took a historic decision to bring the
government departments rendering "non-sovereign functions or services"
if they are found indulging in restrictive, unfair, or monopolistic
trade practices except for those services which are provided free. That
includes road transportation, Railways, housing, and DoT. While most of
them are merely service providers to the consumers, DoT's case is a bit
different. It has two different functions to perform. That of operating
basic telecom services and framing policies for the entire telecom
service industry.

Does the Commission's observation also include DoT, the policy maker?
That is the point of debate. Since there is only one DoT, and it is not
too willing to separate both the roles in near future, DoT, the operator
should also be accountable for what DoT, the policy maker is doing. And
vice versa.

The Commission stated that collection of a fee for a service provided
renders it possible for the consideration by the Commission. That means
DoT--no distinction between policy maker and operator--which has taken
huge sums as licence fees, is also liable to be prosecuted if it fails
to provide service. Does that mean failure to provide easy and
acceptable interconnect facilities to the private operators can be a
reason to bring the case to MRTP Commission? While some feel this is
stretching the thing a bit too much, there is no less number of why nots
in the response. Some also say that the restrictive nature of the
interconnect agreement can be challenged on the grounds that it has made
the sector unfavourable for private operators and has thus negatively
affected the users. It should be mentioned here that as the tender
document did not stipulate any interconnection charges, there should not
be any interconnection charges. Again, DoT does not pay charges for a
call which originates from its network and goes to private operator's
network. So, DoT should also pay interconnection charges. There should
be a common code for everyone. A few of them even go to the extent of
accusing that the main objective of DoT is to maximize its revenue
irrespective of the impact this may have on the consumers and, of
course, private operators. Says TH Chowdary, director, Centre for
Telecom Management and Studies, "This is an anti-competitive,
monopolistic, and restrictive trade practice."

It is noteworthy that in the recent past, the MRTP Commission has issued
a notice to BPL Mobile, one of the cellular service providers in Mumbai.
This happened as per a consumer complaint filed against the value-added
tariff plan of the company. It is mentioned in the complaint that while
BPL Mobile in its value-added tariff plan claims to charge the consumer
Rs 4.25 per minute for every call till the consumer logs up 800 minutes
a month. But, as per the complaint, the company is collecting Rs 5 and
not Rs 4.25, even before the consumer logs up 800 minutes in a month.
This is because the company, in effect, collects Rs 4,000 as advance
charges for calls.

After the new telecom policy was announced in 1994, Indian telecom
scenario has undergone a sea change. During this period, it has gone
through many ups and downs. It has also witnessed many controversies
like not allowing the PSUs to participate in the bidding, capping on
licensing, telecom scam, and change in partnerships. Are not these
enough for MRTP Commission to be a bit stricter in implementing its
regulations on DoT?

DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it has
changed some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.
It is a matter of fact that since the privatization of telecom sector,
DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it has
changed some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.
However, this has not affected the growth of the Indian telecom
industry, till date. It is booming. And, one hopes, it will not do so in
the future also. Let us wait and watch.

VSAT MARKET - LOOKING FOR A FASTER TURNAROUND

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

There is an Indian Airlines flight from Varanasi to New Delhi that goes
via Bhubaneswar. If you take the flight from Varanasi for the capital,
you will fly to Bhubaneswar, and then come to New Delhi. It sounds
amusing.

But, many corporates do the same when it comes to sending electronic
mail. To send E-mail from Delhi to Madras they go to Manhattan. There is
a faster turnaround from outside than inside. One can go on and on
giving examples. But the bottomline is, after years of big talk, the
state of our communication services has improved little. Boasting about
introducing new technologies do not help. Exploring their capabilities
do. Fax has seen a tremendous growth. Reason, it was a revolution at the
customer's end. Structured cabling is seeing explosive growth. Reason,
ditto. Wherever DoT has not got involved, it has been a success story.

Can We Continue To Live With That Kind Of Attitude Today?

Today, the environment is getting increasingly competitive. Quality of
products is rising. Products are moving fast on the store shelves. Take
shirts for example. In the last couple of years, one has seen a number
of foreign brands come in. Arrow, La Coste, Ralph Lauven. In the face of
this competition, some Indian brands have survived, others have not. One
does not hear too much about Wings/Four Seasons these days, though
Zodiac has managed to do well. Indian companies can certainly compete
with global brands in quality of products. Especially in certain
segments, textiles being one. But what they do not have is the resources
that large corporates can deploy. Companies like HLL, Proctor & Gamble,
Philips. Communication is one vital tool of doing business these days.

These Indian companies also need faster, reliable communication. They
would certainly use VSATs if they are provided at an affordable cost.
After years of big talk, the state of our communication services has
improved little.

Companies need to be market ready and ready to market. It involves fast
turnaround. The newly set up private banks like IndusInd, TIMES Bank,
Centurian Bank, all have used VSATs to achieve fast turnaround. Fast
turnaround on information of deposits. And fast turnaround on profits.

And the same is the case in manufacturing and distribution. Ashok
Leyland, Bajaj Auto, SAIL, TISCO, and Essar are using this satellite
technology to move their business processes faster.

Sectors that are doing well in the economy are courier companies,
hotels, and airlines. It is a manifestation of the state of economy.

With increasing globalization, a number of joint ventures are getting
formed. And, just as in a marriage, the joint venture is going through
various stages. The first stage is the courting stage, the second is the
engagement, and the third stage is marriage. Most of the companies are
in the first stage and some are in the second. And they need to be able
to communicate with their partners--foreign and Indian alike. So the
sectors that have a role in supporting these activities are naturally
doing well. It is like the marriage season in Indian economy.

Companies like Hindusthan Lever, Proctor & Gamble, and Citi Bank can set
up their own WAN. But, then they are part of an exclusive club. They can
afford it. DoT has been slow in its commitment on customer
service--HVNET was supposed to be up and running a year ago. One is
still waiting. The other service providers are meeting with some
success. But, at an average cost of Rs 8 lakh per VSAT as far as the
TDM/TDMA variety, it is still pretty much meant only for the elite. So,
customers need to wait for prices to come down and services getting
better.

A new twist that has been added is the Sukh Ram impact. The new boss at
Sanchar Bhawan has delinked himself from day to day operations. But,
what is happening is that in the name of delinking, things are getting
delayed. An example in point. DAMA services have not got off the ground
for any VSAT provider except HFCL and Telstra V-Comm. And the new year
is already six months old.

The Need For Voice

VSATs are already in use. Yet, much more market potential needs to be
tapped. The biggest communication need in the country today is "voice".

The independent gas station owner on the National Highway is not
interested in credit card transactions because he only takes cash,
therefore, has little reason to buy a VSAT terminal. But, if you come
along and you give him a telephone line at a reasonable price and high
quality, he will buy it. There is a larger market opportunity for VSAT
and the market is demanding voice. But, they do not want voice at Rs 8
lakh, they want voice at Rs 50,000 per VSAT. Come to DAMA. At this
pricing policy regime, a DAMA terminal would be costing Rs 15-16 lakh.

Who can afford them such investments?

Today, it is the MNCs and large corporations who can think of using
VSATs. MNCs are used to large pipes connecting their various business
locations. And, in the absence of reliable terrestrial links, they need
to depend on VSATs.

Consider an organization that is Rs 700 crore dealing with high
technology products and services. The total communication costs are of
the order of Rs 3.75-4 crore. The two most important markets for this
organization are the west and south. As a result, 70 percent of the
organization's communication costs are between Mumbai and Bangalore.

That is out of the total communication costs incurred in Mumbai, i.e. of
the order Rs 1.25 crore, Rs 75 lakh are for communication between Mumbai
and Bangalore.

The rule of sercive provision is that the more the network is loaded,
the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is not
about to lose its marketing share.

Let us now look at a scenario where the organization has a dedicated
leased line between Mumbai and Bangalore. The cost of the leased line
(with both fixed and recurring costs) is of the order 14 lakh. Let us
add an additional cost of 10 lakh to the downtime. So the total expenses
would be Rs 24 lakh. Compare that to Rs 75 lakh. That is a saving of 50
lakh.

Today, DoT has got 15,000 leased lines installed country-wide. And, the
concentration is in the metros. But, the issue is leased lines in
centres outside the metros. That is where VSATs can filled the gap.
Also, in its present form access to the PSTN does not exist.

The rule of service provision is that the more the network is loaded,
the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is not
about to lose its marketing share. The more private networks--whether
VSATs or not access DoT's network, the more revenue DoT earns.

Even from the customer's point of view, he is not interested in some
esoteric technology, but rather in getting a phone line on demand. If
VSAT policy remains in the present form, then the real addressable
market is only for the large organizations. However, the access of VSAT
equipment to PSTN will open up a whole new market medium and smaller
companies and even individuals. And, that is the real India.

WILL THE POTENTIAL BE REALIZED?

The answers depend not on technology, but on a variety of other factors:

1. Pricing Policy

Will new services be offered at prices which attract widespread use?
Will new tariffs be extended to maximize revenues from large users or
subsidize the costs of other services?

2. Ownership Of Facilities

Will users such as broadcasters be able to own their own
satellite--receive terminals (downlinks) and transmit stations
(uplinks)? Or will they continue to be required to lease them from DoT
that will recover several times their cost in large charges?

3. Terrestrial Facilities

Will resources be allocated to solve the last mile problem, i.e. to
install local loops or radio links, rebroadcast transmitters, and so on?

4. Competition Or Exclusion

Will the established communication networks take advantage of the
technology to lower the costs and reach new customers? Will they pass on
these savings to their customers or absorb them as additional profit?
Will they attempt to block the entry of new networks designed to reach
unserved customers, or to reach existing users at lower cost?

5. Role Of Government

Will government policies be flexible enough to facilitate maximum use of
the technology. For example, the adoption of policies to minimize user
costs and to encourage new entrants to supply both equipment and
services.

6. Flexibility And Innovativeness

Will organizations that could apply satellite technology to better serve
their customers be flexible and innovative enough to adopt it?

VSAT MARKET - BAMBOO OR BONSAI

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The most important innovation in satellite technology in the Eighties
was Very Small Aperture Terminal or VSAT. Initially, VSATs were designed
for inexpensive low volume data transmission. Today, versions have been
developed that transmit higher volumes of voice, data, and video. India
has an opportunity to leapfrog its underdeveloped communication
infrastructure with rapid VSAT deployment. And thereby pursue strong
economic growth.VSAT technology promises a wealth of new services.

Combined with advances in low cost earth station design, bandwidth
compression techniques to facilitate transmission of motion video, and
new techniques for low cost voice and data communication. And, most
importantly, social and economic benefits for society as a whole.The
market has not taken off as fast as one would have expected. We have a
window of opportunity with this technology. But, will the promise be
fulfilled? The answer depends not on technology, but on a variety of
other factors, chief among them being policy.

A Market Still To Be Born

It is still a big boy's game. At their current price, only the large
corporate users can afford VSATs. In a country that is so large and
where communication infrastructure is concentrated by and large in the
metros, one would believe that there would be a huge potential for this
technology. Its diffusion has not been as rapid as one would have
expected.

We at Voice & Data, in August 1995, had predicted a market potential of
Rs 200 crore in 1995-96. We ended up realizing only about Rs 100 crore.
The problem, however, has not been demand, but access to that demand.
And, one will need to look at flexible solutions in order to achieve
that.

In the growth of this market, the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is not
just a simple equation between demand and supply. But, one of regulating
the whole process. And DoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibiting
role so far.

The tariff structure still does not reflect the advantages of this new
technology--cost independence of distance; point to multipoint
distribution; economical uses of satellite bandwidth. The structure is
still reflective of an attempt to maximize revenues from large users.
And the non-commercial attitude of DoT. It certainly, today, is not seen
as a tool to promote the development of an economy.

VSATs and terrestrial links go hand-in-hand. And, like terrestrial
links, VSATs are pipes. Ones that allow information to flow back and
forth. DoT is the provider of terrestrial links. And with demand
outstripping supply, one would have thought that DoT would encourage
deployment of these "pipes in the sky". In the growth of this market,
the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is not just a simple equation
between demand and supply. But, one of regulating the whole process. And
DoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibiting role so far.

But, DoT is playing its old games. It is a monopoly and it is acting
like one. The satellite carrier cannot market directly to the end user,
but only to DoT. The equipment supplier can try and reach end users as
well as DoT, but the power to take decisions on adoption of technology
rests with DoT. Evidence of users demand can take the form of waiting
lists. In order to help meet that demand, some technology providers
could also conduct "pilot projects". But, if DoT decides not to respond
to this demand, the user has nowhere else to turn.

Contrast this with the diffusion of computers. Diffusion of this
technology does not rely on a single gatekeeper. There may be multiple
channels--wholesalers or retailers. The government may intervene to
control supply, however, by limiting imports and/or encouraging local
production of technology as a developmental strategy. Users are able to
influence supply and price through their activities in the market-place.

VSAT technology is attractive to the user because the service provider
can guarantee high quality and fixed user cost. However, the cost of
acquisition is high. As far as the customer is concerned, DoT blocks
access to equipment and services they need. And may be ready to pay for.

Corporates here can neither set up their own systems to bypass the
unreliable telephone system nor obtain high-quality services from the
telecommunication authorities. So the customer has no choice.

Why is DoT making things difficult for VSAT?

One possible reason could be that it sees VSATs as competing with
its terrestrial infrastructure.

That is why VSATs are not allowed to be connected to the public switched
telephone network. And VSAT service providers are only allowed to
connect in closed user groups. The market has huge potential. But, like
a bamboo, it needs to grow in an open and free environment.

VSATs are not necessarily a standalone technology. It is not a direct
competition for the terrestrial link. In a country where the telephone
density is 1.2 telephones per 100 people and business centres are so
widely spread, VSATs could act as a strong complementary technology.

The average trust in telecommunication service provision is rather low.

And in important matters the traditional methods (personal meeting,
signed papers, etc.) are preferred. To try to change this attitude, a
rapid solution for urgent customer needs is provided by wireless
technologies .... VSATs. DoT needs to implement HVNET fast.

The market has huge potential. But, like a bamboo, it needs to grow in
an open and free environment. People trying to play GOD will end in
creating not the real thing, but a small invitation.

STRUCTURED CABLING - DISTRIBUTION WILL DECIDE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Networking is the next wave and companies are trying to adapt to it.
Structured cabling provides one of the basic entry points for vendors
into customer accounts.

But, today, the focus of competition has shifted from products to
services. Providing services in networking. As a result, managers have
become increasingly concerned about the services their distributors
provide. Ideally, every participant in the distribution channel should
provide the same high-quality services to every customer.

But what are the distribution channels for structured cabling? And how
are managers of these channels looking to provide the same high-quality
services to each and every customer?

THERE are two distinct type of channels. And, they are classified by the
kind of customers that they cater to. The first kind is the
enterprise-wide customers. They are the ones who want turnkey networking
projects executed. And, they are represented by the Top 200 companies in
the country. The second kind is workgroup customers. People whose
networking product and services requirements are of a smaller magnitude.

They constitute the mass market.

WHILE every participant in the distribution channel should provide the
same high-quality services to every customer, in practice, of course,
such consistency is virtually impossible because neither the
manufacturer nor the distributor is likely to excel at everything.

Instead, companies tend to do an outstanding job with some services and
a mediocre job with others.

To overcome these discrepancies, managers commonly try to achieve the
impossible goal of making every channel member equally skilled in every
service. Often this effort entails forcing distributors to hire
additional service personnel or sponsoring training programmes for
distributors.

Innovative managers are trying a different approach. Recognizing that
the proficiencies of some channel members can be used to bolster those
of others, they are experimenting with what we call capabilities-sharing
agreements. Through such agreements, the superior service of one channel
member is substituted for the inferior service of another. Each channel
member offers a greater number of high-quality services at far lower
costs than it could by acting alone. And each contributing distributor
receives appropriate compensation when it shares its superior
capability.

This is the idea, implementation, though, could be tricky. Let us looks
at the national netas. The HCLs, the Wipros, and the like. Today, the
networking products market is of the order of Rs 300 crore. It is
expected to touch Rs 1,200 crore by 1998-99. Four times growth in three
years. And, everyone would be looking to address this market. Now this
market can be segmented into two distinct streams--the enterprise-wide
market and the workgroup market. Opportunities exist in both the
markets. The turnkey solutions market is of the order of Rs 450 crore
and workgroup segment another Rs 750 crore. But how can these
opportunities be addressed by the players?

THIS opportunity is huge and now is the time companies need to be
positioning. For action delayed could be market denied. In order to
highlight the way the market is evolving, we have built up a model.

Consider the given chart. The X axis represents volume, while the Y axis
represents value. Volume means amount of business in structured cabling.
The key driver for this axis is money. The Y axis corresponds to value
add. Higher one goes on the Y axis, higher the value add. The driver of
this axis is intellectual resources.

The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distribute
structured cabling could get it to be classified into different
quadrants.

THE first quadrant has two distinct clusters ... Cluster I has HCL
Comnet, Wipro, Digital, and TISL. These companies are the big names and
traditional rivals. The biggies would want to address the entire market.
But to address those turnkey projects, they will need to form alliances.
Let us take an example. Wipro has bagged an order from BPCL for a
turnkey project. It will be the one point source for the entire project.
However, it has contracted Comptel for doing the structured cabling.

That is Comptel's strength. And, this partnership is not only for this
particular project, but rather on a more continuous basis. Same is the
case with HCL Comnet which as been developing its own cabling partners.
The company has met with a great deal of success in bagging campus-wide
network projects. Cable laying requires a great deal of customization.
And for this specialized job, you need to call in professionals. Digital
is going to gain from growth in the manufacturing sector. TISL has some
key accounts which it should be able to leverage on.

Cluster II has players like MicroLand, Datacraft-RPG, and PCL. CMS is
the one to watch as it has been gaining ground rapidly. These people
will bag, on an average, less revenue from structured cabling in the
enterprise-wide cases than the biggies.

MicroLand has a strong presence in the corporate segment, Datacraft-RPG
is making inroads through its network integration focus. PCL is another
player in this league with strong public sector and government accounts.
CMS is beginning to make an impact. It got shortlisted in the Reliance
deal with HCL, Wipro, and Digital.

The long-term success of turnkey/enterprise-wide solution providers will
depend on how well they are able to partner with other smaller players.

The big guys have bagged these corporate accounts after aggressive
selling and close customer contact. It is now going to be difficult for
them to give up control to their partners. Comptel is doing
sub-contracting work on cabling with Wipro, but in time would be getting
big enough to pitch for certain contracts on its own. In any case, the
smaller partners shall be increasing their influence in the active
components of the networking game while the biggies would want them to
concentrate on the passive components only. This is because structured
cabling is not where these biggies make money, with increasing
competition, margins are certainly getting squeezed. They carry cable in
order to provide a one stop shop to the customer; margins are higher in
doing higher value add, network design, and integration.

IF you look at the second quadrant, here are companies that are playing
the high volume game. Advantec, Apcom, and MicroLand/Microsell. That is
the present state. There is an opportunity for both HCL Comnet and Wipro
to get into the distribution game. This is because they have large reach
nation-wide and also partners who would be looking to source structured
cabling from them. And, they seem to be preparing to get into it.

Advantec has certainly been very successful. It was a pioneer of sorts
and is modeling itself on Anixter. Anixter is one of the most successful
distribution chains world-wide.

In the distribution game, it is reach and level of support that is
provided to the customers which set distributors apart. This high-volume
game is going to be addressing the large workgroup market. Also, a
number of structured cabling vendors would be depending on these
distributors to get their brand visibility and marketshare. AT&T, today,
has alliances with most of the key guys in the game, Advantec,
Microsell, and Wipro. Apcom is another leader in the distribution game.

It is helping Nortel gain market share. HCL Comnet is the one to watch.
It is working in an exclusive relationship with Siemon. It will be
interesting to see how it builds up the Siemon brand against Lucent.

Another cluster that is emerging in the same quadrant has companies like
IT&T, BNA, and C-Tel. These are companies that have signed distribution
agreements with AMP, BICC, and IBM, respectively. IT&T is a medium-sized
networking company, focusing mainly on markets in the North and West.

BNA is a strong technology company that has focused on cabling right
from the start. It is based out of Bangalore. C-Tel is a company that
also has a strong technology orientation. It has been looking at the
networking market from the high value-add side--things like network
design and integration. The market is growing rapidly and all these
companies have an opportunity to penetrate the market. How successful
they are, depends on their choice of target segments and reach.

The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distribute
structured cabling could get it to be classified into different
quadrants.

THE third quadrant has companies that are the workhouses ... the actual
implementors. Companies like Proactive Data Systems, Comptel, BNA,
Optel, Gateway Systems, Delta Force, Taker Technologies, Advanced Micro
Devices, and Infotech. They are the guys who get their hands dirty.

Companies here are relatively new and small. And have very different
backgrounds. Proactive Data Systems has evolved from a background of
vending networking products and services. Taker Technologies has history
of providing EPABX Systems. Optel and Gateway Systems are dealing with
fibre optic cable. This is a specialized area. Optel is partnering with
HCL Comnet on campus wide projects.

Gateway Systems is more focused in the West--addressing large corporate
customers like Bajaj Auto and Telco. So, the backgrounds here are both
voice and data. And, there are some who have always focused only on
cables, like BNA. One will see increasing number of players as this is
one entry point into the market. But then companies here will start
moving into other quadrants. Like, Proactive which is trying to move up
with higher value add and BNA that is looking at the mass market.

THE fourth quadrant is the sector where one is seeing the largest chunk
of hidden champions move in. Companies like Ramco, Zenith, Unicorp,
Melstar, DCM DataSystems, IT&T, and Samtech. These are companies who are
targeting the workgroup market. They are realizing that structured
cabling is a key point of entry into the customer's backyard. They are
realizing that they need to have influence on as many networking
products as possible. So, they are extending their focus from boxes to
the core of the network infrastructure; and, provide a total network
solution to the customer.

Ramco, for example, has been one of the biggest channels for Bay's hub
sales in the country. Realizing the strong correlation between hubs and
structured cabling, it is now focusing on cabling as well. And, as it is
targeting largely workgroups, it is a typical IV quadrant player.
Another interesting company here is DCM DataSystems. It is focusing on
the networking products and services market, more importantly, the
government and public sector organizations, the typical tender market.
And, it has tied up with AMP, a recognized structured cabling brand from
the US.

These are one kind of players here. Another are companies who are
targeting newer opportunities in structured cabling itself. Structured
cabling involves UTP and fibre. Laying fibre is still a specialized job.
And, a whole lot of opportunities are emerging in manufacturing and
telecommunication sectors to deploy fibre. Here companies like Optel,
Gateway Systems, and Proactive Data Systems are trying to position
themselves.

STRUCTURED CABLING - INTERVIEW WITH AJAY ADVANI, DIRECTOR, LUCENT
TECHNOLOGIES

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Ajay Advani, director, Lucent Technologies and former director,
Advantec, is one man who has had the inside track of the structured
cabling in India right from its inception. Interview with him follows.

Structured cabling was a new concept here in 1992. What was your
experience in this early phase?

Things were hard. In those days, I remember making customer calls and
getting insulted. "Haven't heard of your company and if this technology
is as great as you claim, then with a brand like AT&T to back it, it
does not need selling. And if we want this thing, we will speak to AT&T
directly."

What was the focus then?

One thing was getting to be clear. Customers are apprehensive of new
technology. They are looking for change, a better change. But they are
not sure whether this vendor is the right vendor or not. I tried to make
the customers comfortable. To reassure them that there is no catch. But
I needed reference sites.

When did that happen?

My first reference site came to me in February 1993, over six months
after I had been in the field. It was a Wipro customer, a paint company
in Mumbai, to whom the company had sold 11-12 nodes. That was the first
time I saw this technology work in India.

Who were your first major customers?

Banks. MNC banks were my first major customers. Citibank, Chase
Manhattan, Standard Chartered.

How do you see the technology evolving?

Technology is heading towards faster and faster data transmission
speeds. Voice and data was integrated early. Video was a bit of a
problem, but that has now been taken care of. Today, you have buildings
with structured cabling systems that support outlets for phone, PC, TV,
VCR, smoke detector, and fire alarm.

Are you referring to intelligent buildings? Don't you think it is a
little futuristic today?

The concept of intelligent building is more with respect to the mindset
of the builder. Structured cabling helps add value to properties. Cost
of real estate is rising rapidly--at least in the metros. While property
rates have grown 200 percent in the last two years in Mumbai, builders
are looking to provide value to properties. Along with marble on the
floor, granite in the kitchen, and phone with voice mail and other
features, they are planning to provide shafts for structured cabling.

STRUCTURED CABLING - THE MAGIC MARKET

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Having good quality cabling infrastructure is very important as over 70
percent of the network problems are cabling-related, and the cost of
downtime can exceed original costs.

However, in our interactions with corporate users and industry, we came
across some interesting trends. One is that both the supply side and
demand side are driving the cabling market. Also, size of market
opportunity is getting major network integrators to look at this market
from more than one viewpoint.

The supply side of the equation shows entry of a number of new
international vendors. Demand is getting fuelled from not only the
existing markets, but the new markets as well.

We are presenting the method in the madness--of how we see things unfold
and on what is hot in today's technology.

The most important trend in networking today is "growing demand".
Corporates are reporting an increase of 20 percent to 70 percent per
year in the number of nodes they are adding to their networks. And what
does networking entail? It enables resource-sharing. In other words,
connecting resources together. And to connect, one needs cable.

"Structured cable", in today's context.

But why so much hoopla about structured cabling? The great interest in
structured cabling is because it provides convenience. The drivers for
cabling today are the need for resource-sharing, the need to scale-up
office productivity, and an increased emphasis on workgroup
collaboration. And in order to achieve this, every seat in an
organization needs to be network ready. Irrespective of where you are
sitting, you need to be connected.

Every seat in an organization needs to be network ready. Irrespective of
where you are sitting, you need to be connected.

The structured cabling market is seeing strong growth, growing over five
times in two years. From Rs 23 crore in 1994-95 to over Rs 120 crore by
1996-97. Both the supply side and the demand side continue to fuel
growth. There is a great deal of infrastructure that needs to be put in
place in organizations as the economy becomes more service driven and
competitive.

The market is being driven by three distinct forces. First is the
presence of increased number of players. The second is the demand in new
customer segments--geographically and sectorially. And, third is
increased networking industry focus.

THE number of structured cabling vendors has grown three times in the
last six months. Till March 1995, the active players were Lucent
(formerly AT&T), Nortel, and Siemon. Today, we have six more
players--AMP, BICC, Digital, IBM, Molex/Mod-Tap, and Siemens. RAD/RIT
Group is also planning to enter the market.

So far, Lucent is the clear leader having entered the market early with
a strong product offering and its principal channel partners--Advantec
and MicroLand--having done a great job. HCL Comnet has helped Siemon
gain a foothold in this market, while Apcom has consolidated Nortel's
position in the structured cabling market.

Looking at the rapid growth of this market, a number of international
vendors felt that they needed a piece of the action. AMP, a US-based
company, has entered the market through alliances with IT&T and DCM
DataSystems. BICC Brand Rex, a UK-based company and part of one of the
largest cable companies, has forged alliances with BNA Flexinet Systems
and CMC. Digital and IBM, the leading computer vendors and the early
propounders of this technology, also have their own version of
structured cabling systems. Molex is one of the leading connector
companies in the world and has its own manufacturing plant here. It is
distributing its cabling system through Intercom Systems and Eiko
Computers. Siemens is a major player in the European market with its
shielded twisted pair offering. RAD/RIT, an Israeli company, has
alliances with CG Informatics and MRO-Tek.

So far, structured cabling has fund favour in the large cities. Now,
the market is moving out and beyond them. Into industrial towns and
clusters.

FROM the supply side to the demand side. Demand is rising--not only in
existing segments, but in new segments too. One of the earliest
customers was the financial sector--Citibank, ANZ Grindlays, and
Standard Chartered are some prominent names. Citibank, in 1993, was
looking to provide telebanking services to its customers. And, it needed
to get its infrastructure in place. The demand for structured cabling
came in from the telecommunication side. Today, as Citibank looks at
expanding its suite of customer services, both voice and data
applications are getting increasingly deployed.

These and other top-of-the-line organizations in the financial sector
were the first to invest in structured cabling. For them, it was a key
infrastructure requirement. The same was the case with Kentucky Fried
Chicken. It is known for talking "chicken". But even before it ordered
its chickens, it had got its cables in place. And all thought-out and
structured. Same has been the case with Coca Cola, Levi-Strauss, and,
now, Ford. These are large transnational companies who understand the
value of having infrastructure in place to provide services to their
customers. Whether it is cola, cloth, or cars.

Another segment is the high-tech sector--information technology and
communication companies. Companies like Oracle, Novell, Motorola, and
Nortel. Software Technology Parks have also seen large scale deployment
of structured cabling. HCL Consulting, Infosys, and Cadence are examples
of such companies.

The campuses also have contributed to the market. IISc Bangalore, IIT
Kharagpur, IIT Mumbai, IT-BHU, and JNU are examples of networked
campuses.

The big opportunities are emerging in manufacturing. A large number of
steel, automobile, and consumer durable companies are setting up shops.
General Motors and Larsen & Toubro are setting up factories in Baroda.
Ludhiana is emerging as a key centre where a whole lot of structured
cabling is getting deployed. Hero Cycles is one of the major sites. But,
a whole set of new customers are coming up there.

Typically, so far, structured cabling has found favour in the large
cities--Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, and Mumbai. In places like
Coimbatore/Tirupur, Cochin, and Hyderabad in the South, in the
industrial clusters of Lucknow/Kanpur, Bhopal/Indore, and in and around
Ludhiana in the North. The most industrial activity today seems to be
happening along the Vapi belt ... along Mumbai/Surat stretch, and also
in Pune/Nasik in the West.

The Taj Group of Hotels is looking to deploy structured cabling across
its 40 locations country-wide. Here, apart from providing infrastructure
support, structured cabling is also seen to add value to "the
properties".

This is the same concept that a number of builders and architects are
toying with. DLF, Ansals, and Raheja are builders looking at deploying
structured cabling along with a whole suite of other facilities.

Hospitals are another opportunity area. A great deal of voice and data,
and video flows back and forth in a modern hospital.

Another potential opportunity area for structured cabling is emerging in
telecommunications. Cellular service has been operational in the metros
for almost a year now. And, cellular networks are getting to be rolled
out in other states. Escotel has announced start of services in Meerut,
some 70 km from Delhi. These structured cabling products could be
modified to suit some of the needs of these operators. Particularly, in
networks with distributed architectures, data flow can be done through
structured cabling.

THE last (but certainly not the least) driver of the structured cabling
market is the increased networking industry focus. Wipro formed an
alliance with Lucent in July 1996. HCL Comnet, in August 1996, appointed
a general manager to spearhead its indirect channel sales. These events
have a common thread. Wipro was earlier sourcing its structured cabling
requirement from Advantec. Today, it feels that with its reach and
focus, it can get into the distribution game, apart from its focus on
network systems integration. The same is the case with HCL Comnet. These
are large IT groups and their focus has been on high value addition in
the network integration game. But that was true when the cabling market
was only at the high end--the enterprise level whether large campuses or
large corporate accounts. Now, the market is taking on mass market
colours, and the big networking companies--HCL Corp., Wipro, Digital,
TISL, MicroLand, and Datacraft-RPG are getting very interested. And,
when they get interested, the market potential intensifies.

Also, the new entrants into the structured cabling market, AMP, has
formed alliances with IT&T and DCM DataSystems. With IT&T, the alliance
is to act as a distributor and also a network integrator. With DCM
DataSystems, it is for a whole range of networking products. Same is the
case with BNA which is to act as a distributor for BICC. Siemon has an
exclusive relationship with HCL, while Nortel is going with Apcom.

You can also expect a whole host of other networking companies--Ramco,
CMS, Comptel, Unicorp, Samtech, and others--to get interested. After
all, structured cabling is one point of entry into a customers network.
And an increasingly important one.

THE structured cabling technology is in transition. Traditional cabling
was the cause of over half the network's downtime. Structured cabling
provides paths of reliability in information flow in the ever-changing
world of networks. Structured cabling system is a complete
infrastructure. It consists of cables and the connecting hardware as
well as the installation and administration practices required to
provide system reliability and longevity. A structured cabling system is
designed to provide a physical link between every work area in a
building or in a campus, and is installed with little knowledge of the
type of communication equipment being connected to it. It accommodates
all of a building's current communication requirements and provides the
ability to cope with new needs as they arise.

When one thinks of structured cabling systems, one thinks of cabling
connectors, wall plates, work area outlets, test equipment, and patch
panels to support standards based 100 Ohm Category 3, 4, and 5 UTP as
well as 62.5/125 mm fibre optic cabling. Today, "Category 5" has become
the hottest term since UTP. But what are these Cats?

Category 3 cable is intended to be used for voice and data transmission
rates up to 10 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 16 MHz.

Category 4 is intended to be used for voice and data transmission rates
up to 16 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 20 MHz. Category 5
is intended to be used for voice and data transmission rates up to 100
Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 100 MHz.

ONE characteristic that will be critical in all future structured
cabling technologies is their relationship to the technology already
installed. The new generation of technology must offer more than mere
investment protection though it must certainly offer that. And, it must
do more than simply integrate the new technology with the existing
infrastructure. Owners will want new technology to evolve in such a way
that it adds value continuously to the infrastructure investment already
made.

And, they will want this happen across the board in systems, in the
products that implement the systems; in the support available; in the
business process involved in buying and installing new systems; and in
the development of applications and services.

fibre optic, screened twisted-pair, and shielded twisted pair. Today, it
is UTP which gets most prominence. And, more importantly, the
high-performance Category 5 cabling.

* AMP

A recent entrant into the Indian market, AMP's Net Connect cabling
system is targeted towards open systems architecture. It has tied up
with IT&T and DCM DataSystems to distribute its cabling products and is
looking for a distributor in the South. It plans to aggressively push
fibre cables.

* BICC Brand Rex

Scotland-based BICC Brand Rex is a merger of one of the largest cable
manufactures, BICC Cables, with Brand Rex Inc. It has an alliance with
the RPG Group, one of the largest Indian business houses. It has
appointed BNA Flexinet Systems and CMC as its distributors and network
integrators.

* Digital

One of the pioneers of the concept of structured cabling. Its cabling
system is application specific. It needs to come out more aggressively
in the market as manufacturing is the big opportunity.

* IBM

Another of the pioneers, who lost its lead to more open systems in
structured cabling. Has entered the market through a tie-up with C-Tel.

TISL, the network integration company, has a large customer base along
with its partners like CMS and Zenith.

* Molex/Mod-Tap

One of the leading connector companies in the world. Has acquired
Mod-Tap and vends the Mod-Tap universal system. Local manufacturing will
be key in the long run and it has got its acts together on that front.

Has distribution arrangements with Intercom Systems.

* Siemens

This German giant has a major presence in Europe. In India, it needs to
get more aggressive. It has a strong product in the shielded twisted
pair segment. That will find a market primarily in the manufacturing
sector, with large number of users.

* Nortel

One of the leading vendors in the North American market, here Apcom has
helped it get a foothold. Apcom is a strong distribution player and has
performed well in the copper-based segment of the market, so far. The
focus has been on banking, software technology parks, and campus wide
networks.

* Lucent

Is the market leader and has a head start in being the first into the
Indian market. It has had major success in top-of-the-line
organizations. The challenge would be to take on the collective might of
the new entrants. Like a leader, it will have to look at newer
opportunities in deploying structured cabling systems.

* Siemon

Has an exclusive relationship with HCL Comnet. It is one of the major
cabling companies and competes well with its competitors and, in some
instances, exceeds them with its regular introduction of new products.

INTERNET, UNIFIED MESSAGING SEEN EMERGING IN 1996

     Converging technologies will change the business of voice
technology this year, analysts told VTSN when we asked what companies
should expect from the voice industry in 1996.
     No one could talk about the coming year without mentioning the
Internet and how it would affect the voice market.  Private branch
exchanges (PBXs) and telephony servers will merge to create
integrated, do-it-all servers on which enterprises will run mission-
critical networks.  The long predicted emergence of unified messaging
and computer telephony integration (CTI) finally will become a reality
in 1996.

The Internet:  CB Radio or New Paradigm

     Even with all the excitement over the Internet in 1995, there
still are many consultants predicting its imminent demise.
     "It's not clear to me that the Internet is not just [citizen's
band] radio," said Dusty Sykes, a consultant for analyst firm Vanguard
Communications Corp. in Morris Plains, N.J.
     But even if it is a passing trend, companies are spending
considerable time, money and resources crafting Internet strategies
and incorporating the Internet into products.
     "The Internet will be very big this year," said Sheila McGee-
Smith, of the PELORUS Group in Raritan, N.J.  "I think people are
spending a lot of time investigating what kind of presence ... [they]
need to have.  I think we are beyond the point of 'do I need a
presence,' [and now should be asking] 'how do I integrate this into
the back office and how do I make money from this.'  Companies need to
know whether there is money to be made or not."   
     The rush to the Internet has not been all rosy, analysts said,
because many other technologies were ignored in 1995 as companies
clamored for more Internet presence.  One example is fax-on-demand.
     "The same money that might have been budgeted for fax-on-demand
has gone into [World Wide] Web pages," said Peter Davidson, president
of Davidson Consulting in Burbank, Calif.    
     After awhile, the people who are putting money into the Internet
are going to realize it only hits one segment of the marketplace and
they are going to go to fax as well.  [Then] the Internet may create
opportunities for fax-on-demand."  
     In the voice market, Internet activities are particularly visible
in call centers.  Big call center companies, such as Aspect
Communications Corp. of San Jose, Calif., and Rockwell of Downers
Grove, Ill., announced they would be adding technology to their
products that allow callers to access customer service representatives
in call centers by clicking a button on a World Wide Web page.  
     Smaller companies, such as San Jose, Calif.-based Edify Corp.,
also announced software that would perform similar tasks through
software-only, open solutions.  
     McGee-Smith expects to see many more Internet-related
announcements from call center companies and "more focusing on call
center vendors' end-user.  People will need to be able to access call
centers from the Internet."
     The call center market also will continue to grow in 1996, McGee-
Smith said.  "I can't imagine anybody saying ... that [the call center
market] is mature.  That is like saying the personal computer (PC)
market is mature--it is constantly changing."

Combining Telephony and Switches on One Server

     What CTI gurus long have been predicting seems set to come true
in 1996--telephony servers that will run both an enterprise's PBX and
computer-telephony over a single network. 
     "The marketplace is going to recognize that the idea of adding
devices to existing PBXs does not make sense and the market will
recognize that a new paradigm is upon us--new telephony switch servers
that integrate voice, data and communications services," said Jim
Burton, president of C-T Link in Boston.
     AltiGen Communications Inc. in Fremont, Calif., is one company
already causing a buzz over its yet unseen "open multimedia platform
that will offer integrated servers," according to new vice president
of marketing, Gary Andresen, formerly a senior consultant for
Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. 
     Andresen was so impressed by AltiGen's forthcoming platform that
he left Dataquest to get on board with a company that would be
offering what he had been saying eventually would be the enterprise
telephony solution, he told VTSN.  Look for upstart AltiGen to
announce its new platform at the Computer Telephony show in Los
Angeles, March 12-14.
     The type of solution companies such as AltiGen will offer is a
"self-contained unit that has fax, integrated messaging, interactive
voice response, and a switching element so that you have telephone
lines coming in from the central office and telephones serving out of
the box to the desktop.  A web server might also be a part of the
communications, and an automated attendant," Burton said.

Unified Messaging Will Take Hold

     The universal in-box and unified messaging platform are two
technologies all of the big messaging companies--voice and electronic-
-have been pursuing fervently.  Analysts say 1996 will be the year
these offerings become reality.
     "I believe that messaging is the 'killer app' that everyone has
been looking for and it has been sitting in front of us for the past
five years," Vanguard analyst Sykes said. 
     With the need for multimedia messaging driving a technology
convergence, players new to the voice market are changing:  software
heavy-hitters Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Novell
Inc..  
     All three have said they will have next generation client-server
messaging systems coming out in the first half of 1996, and all have
announced or demonstrated plans to include universal in-boxes that
will receive electronic, fax and voice messages.  All three also are
crafting Internet strategies that they are incorporating into these
systems. 
     Release 4.0 of Lotus Notes will become available Jan. 10.  Notes
already offers third-party applications that make it a viable
computer-telephony platform, such as San Diego-based Blue Sky
Technologies' Phone Notes.  However, release 4.0 adds functionality to
Notes while making it simpler to manage and lowering the price. 
Analysts expect the differences to increase Notes popularity, despite
predictions that simpler technologies--such as web browsers--would
dethrone Notes as large enterprise's groupware platform of choice.
     Microsoft has said its Exchange server product would be out some
time in the first quarter of 1996, and many companies have put their
messaging plans on hold until they get a chance to look at what the
Redmond, Wash.-based company is going to offer.  With a large
corporate migration to Windows NT, the company's powerful high-end
operating system, many users will want to use a native Microsoft
messaging solution as well.
     Microsoft also has shown a solid commitment to both computer-
telephony and fax in its products.  Its new operating system, Windows
95, included Microsoft's telephony API (TAPI), Microsoft Fax and a
link to Sprint Corp.'s broadcast fax service in its offering (VTSN,
Aug. 8, 1995,).  
     Novell Netware users are waiting for Novell to release Groupwise
XTD, which finally will make Novell's popular groupware offering into
a client-server messaging architecture.  Groupwise XTD will offer
updated calendaring and scheduling, and Gary Rowe, principal of Rowe
Communications in Atlanta, said Groupwise XTD is "probably the
furthest ahead in the universal mailbox arena."

Fax's Role in Unified Messaging

     The universal mailbox is expected to boost fax's messaging role,
making it both easier and more preferable because of the direct
connection and exact image replication fax offers.
     "Fax is an integral part of the universal mailbox," said Maury
Kauffman, managing partner at The Kauffman Group in Cherry Hill, N.J.
     The proof of this, Kauffman said, is Kirkland, Wash.-based
Applied Voice Technologies' purchase of RightFax of Tucson, Ariz., for
$4.2 million in cash and stock last week.  "This is sending a message
to all the other voice- and E-mail companies that if they don't have a
fax [component], they won't be able to compete."
     Analysts say RightFax leads the market in fax servers, followed
by Optus Software in Somerset, N.J.; they expect the local area
network (LAN)-based fax server market to expand rapidly in 1996.  "In
terms of LAN fax itself, we will see growth rates through the roof,"
Kauffman said.  "There are at least a million Novell networks.  Less
than 10 percent have fax servers on them," Kauffman said.
     The rise of Windows NT also will help the LAN-based fax server
market, consultant Davidson said.  "[Last year] has really been a year
of pilot testing NT-based servers.  1996 will be the year when
commercial sales start to happen in a big way.  What you are going to
have is what was a DOS-based industry become, as much or more so, an
NT-based industry," Davidson said. 

Forming Standards To Meet New Needs

     The introduction of computer software companies that adhere to a
different, more competitive business strategy changed the way voice
companies thought about their own strategies last year.  Once a market
of closed and proprietary technology, the voice industry has been
forced by the encroaching computer software industry to open their
platforms.  
     In response to that need, the Enterprise Computer Telephony Forum
(ECTF) seemed to come from nowhere to become a major industry force in
1995, leaving the other voice standards organization--Versit--
scrambling for position in the rapidly changing voice standards arena.
     "The most important is the formation of the ECTF.  They will get
together and see that we have interoperability--even without Microsoft
and Intel.  There isn't a play for Microsoft and Intel in the ECTF
except to follow what's going on and participate," Burton said.  
     "The Versit community has to be asking themselves whether they
are accomplishing what their goals have been."
     Versit is a four-company standards group composed of AT&T Corp.,
Apple Computer Corp., IBM Corp. and Siemens Rolm.  Each of the
founding Versit companies, along with Novell, joined the ECTF in July
1995.
     Versit worked on its own standard of Novell's open telephony
services application programming interface (TSAPI)--Versit TSAPI.  It
also brought out its encyclopedia of computer-telephony standards, the
Versit Encyclopedia, which is available for anyone to download on
Versit's home page at http://www.versit.com.
     One of the ECTF's goals for this year, according to ECTF
President Tom Zenisek, is to make its own work on Versit TSAPI and the
Versit Encyclopedia its second major project.  In 1996, the ECTF will
release its first body of work:  the telephony application objects
(TAO) specification, which it was given to develop by the Single
Computing System Architecture (SCSA) consortium.  
     The ECTF plans to release the specification at the Computer
Telephony show in March, and have a membership technical and marketing
committee meeting immediately afterwards, on March 15, in Los Angeles.

VOICE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRAL TO RETAIL BANKING SERVICES

     Banks are turning increasingly to voice technology among
solutions to providing 24-hour remote retail banking services.  
     "We believe that eventually this will be the preferred method of
interacting with a bank and there will be appropriate revenue
streams," said Henry Mounger, senior vice president of Deposit
Guaranty National Bank in Jackson, Miss.  "Right now it's (an issue
of) market leadership.  We believe we are laying the groundwork for
what the future of banking delivery will look like. ... It is hard in
the early stages to put a benefit to that."

Working with Visa

     Deposit Guaranty, which has almost $6 billion in assets and
serves Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, is working with Visa
Interactive of San Francisco to provide its customers with remote
banking solutions.  In 1988, the bank installed a virtual response
unit (VRU) from InterVoice of Dallas, to handle requests for account
balances.  In November 1994, Deposit Guaranty offered touch-tone bill
payment, and introduced remote banking by personal computer (PC) in
November 1995, Mounger said.  
     This year, Deposit Guaranty also will begin selling customers
PhonePlus screenphones for approximately $200 to $250 a piece. 
Several bank employees have been trying the screenphones since April,
and Deposit Guaranty plans to select 250 customers to test the system
for free for several months.  Customers will pay an undetermined
monthly fee to use the service.
     Mounger admits the bank is not sure which device or method
customers will prefer--one reason Deposit Guaranty has chosen to
provide its customers with several options.
     "There are lots of mixed reviews on screenphones," Mounger said. 
"We don't want to dictate which device wins [and] we ... have to offer
different options."  Visa buys the screenphones from U.S. Order and
Verifone manufactures the phones which include some intelligence so
users can perform a variety of tasks off-line.  "Visa's strategy is to
  ... support their electronic banking platform by making it compatible
with several screenphones," Mounger said.
     On a systems level, Visa Interactive provides software and
outsourcing services for banks that want to offer remote banking
solutions.  Deposit Guaranty uses Visa to outsource its bill payment
services, which approximately 1,800 customers use.  When a customer
calls in to pay bills, Deposit Guaranty's VRU transfers the customer
to Visa's network, which is linked to Deposit Guaranty's database, and
the funds are transferred then from the customer's account to the
payee. 
     Deposit Guaranty also plans to offer services from the Internet,
although the bank is not yet sure what it will do beyond getting a
home page and World Wide Web site.  "We will be relying on a third
party such as Visa Interactive to get us to that level," Mounger said.
     For its part, Visa is working hard to develop its Internet
applications--last summer it allied with San Francisco-based Worlds
Inc. to develop three-dimensional banking and retailing applications
for the Internet. (Deposit Guaranty National Bank, 601/968-4759; Visa
Interactive, 415/432-2753, http://www.visa.com.)    .DEPARTMENT

EDIFY HELPING BUSINESSES BUILD INTERNAL `INTRANET' SOLUTIONS

     Edify Corp.'s agent software for the World Wide Web is making an
impact on both the user and investor community.  Unisys Corp. last
month purchased Electronic Workforce 4.0 to provide a self-service
human resource application to its 36,000 employees worldwide. 
Employees will access this information through the "Intranet," or
internal World Wide Web, that Unisys' human resources department is
building.  Telephone and fax access soon will be added to the system.
     Wall Street also has taken notice of Edify:  Goldman Sachs & Co.,
of New York City, led an investment group that purchased a $7.4
million minority stake in the company.  Among the investors was
Michael Dell, founder and chief executive of Dell Computer Corp.
     The Edify program will give Unisys employees secure and
controlled access to their human resource records, including benefits
and available leave information, through the Intranet.  Electronic
Workforce 4.0 also will work with PeopleSoft's Human Resource
Management System (HRMS) to allow employees to update records either
over the Web or via telephone.   
     Bluebell, Pa.-based Unisys believes it can control human resource
personnel costs by letting employees make their own changes to certain
personal information, according to Lee Stivale, information technology
project director for human resource systems at Unisys.  
     Unisys also wants to use Electronic Workforce to give its
international employees continuous access to each other.  The
Electronic Workforce integrates such devices and communications
methods as telephones, fax and E-mail with the World Wide Web.

OCTEL BEEFS UP MESSAGING SOFTWARE TO UNITE DISPARATE PLATFORMS  

     Milpitas, Calif.-based Octel Communications Corp. released
version 1.1 of its Aria messaging software specifically for Overture
250 and 350 message servers.  It also runs on Aspen, Branch, Maxum and
XC1000 servers.  Octel says customers can migrate to Aria 1.1 without
losing existing data or having to change equipment.  Users can convert
Octel's systems to an Octel Overture 250 or 350 message system using
Aria 1.1.  The software adds back-up and restore features to the Aria
platform and a Global Message Redundancy option that keeps servers up
and running even if one part of the system fails.  The software is
available immediately in the U.S. and in early 1996 in Great Britain
and Ireland.  (Octel, 408/321-2000.)

FCC DISCUSSING LEVYING TAX ON ISPS TO ENSURE UNIVERSAL SERVICE

       The bold Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering
levying a tax on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) because of the
growth of certain technologies, specifically Internet phone software,
that is allowing the Internet to be used in lieu of the phone
companies, bypassing access fees.  The FCC is concerned that by taking
this revenue from local phone companies, phone service for hard-to-
reach rural areas will increase.  A Notice of Proposed Rule Making may
be issued sometime this year, sources said.  The Commission is
considering levying either a flat tax or basing it on an accounting
system that would make ISPs account for all the traffic they send
through the local exchange and then pay a fee based on that traffic. 
ISPs would then choose whether to pass those savings on to users.

NEC RELEASES CTI APPLICATION FOR ITS PBX SYSTEMS

       NEC America Inc., of Irving, Texas, entered the race to provide
computer-telephony integration (CTI) solutions.  NEC announced Desktop
Receptionist, a Windows-based application for both its private branch
exchange (PBX) systems--NEAX 2400 ICS and the NEAX 2000 IVS.  The
software uses Microsoft's Telephony Application Programming Interface
(TAPI) to make, answer and transfer phone calls using a personal
computer instead of a telephone.  The software also can set up
conference calls, send out pages, transfer voice messages and search
directories.  On the administration side, Desktop Receptionist has
password-accessible security and a reporting application that allows
managers to track incoming call activity, call status and call type. 
The application can be used as a primary answering system, automated
receptionist or a backup answering service. (NEC America Inc.,

INTERVOICE GRANTED PATENT FOR `APPLET' ARCHITECTURE

     Dallas-based InterVoice Inc. is using a hot, new idea in the
Internet community to run advanced intelligent networks (AINs).  It's
making "mini-applications" available for its platforms by placing them
on intelligent peripherals (IPs) over AIN architectures.  The result
is a smarter system that makes use more evenly of system resources.  
     InterVoice has been issued U.S. patent number 5,469,500 for its
technology, which distributes an AIN application's intelligence into
subscripts, once called "applets" and now referred to as service
application modules (SAMs).  SAMs run on an IP instead of leaving the
intelligence on a service control point (SCP), which often handles
such tasks as network database management.  
     "A SAM would be something such as voice mail, voice-activated
dialing, single number service, or automated service activation," said
Al Samball, manager of new business development.  "The modules all can
be tied together."  
     This requires the SCP to exert a lower level of control over the
IP, said Mike Polcyn, InterVoice's vice president of business
development and product marketing. 

Taking the Pressure Off

     Transferring some of the network intelligence and tasks to IPs
takes the pressure off SCPs, much like using an Internet applet means
that the user can avoid taking up personal computer memory storing
applications and instead run the program straight off a remote server.
     "An IP is typically performing very primitive functions," said
Polcyn.  "Play a particular message, collect digits, and so on.  When
you get into a complex application like voice-activated dialing that
has a couple of layers of user dialogue, user input or information
access, the overhead on the SCP of dealing with that complexity in a
very large port configuration would be somewhat overwhelming in terms
of processor requirements."  
     "If you were to break that application into pieces that could be
delegated to the IP, it could perform a lot of those functions
autonomously and then return to the SCP the result of that
processing," he added.
     Polcyn said InterVoice would incorporate this technology into its
own products.  He would not disclose whether the company plans to
license the technology to other vendors. 
     InterVoice also announced that it has joined Texas-based Tandem
Computers Inc.'s Tandem Alliance Program.  The program develops
connections between Tandem's platforms and software from allied
vendors to provide integrated solutions for customers.  Initially,
Intervoice said it will offer voice-activated dialing, single-number
follow-me services, an automated assistant, and voice navigation and
voice mail applications.  (InterVoice, 214/454-8834; Tandem, 214/516-
6484.)
