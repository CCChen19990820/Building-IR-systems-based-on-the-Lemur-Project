DEAN WITTER TO DELIVER MARKET DATA TO BRANCHES
VIA PARENT SEARS ROEBUCK'S TERRESTRIAL NETWORK

  In what may have been a fait accompli, Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. has opted to use the IBM System Network Architecture (SNA)
terrestrial network of parent Sears Roebuck & Co. to deliver
market data and other information to its 350 retail brokerage
branches nationwide.

  The firm last week announced an exclusive, 7-1/2-year, 10,000-
workstation market data contract with Thomson Financial Services
Inc.'s ILX Systems Inc. market data subsidiary. ILX will oust
incumbent quote terminal providers Quotron Systems Inc. and
Automatic Data Processing Inc.

  Dean Witter had enough problems choosing a market data vendor
for its new firmwide branch system without monkeying around with
the networking piece. Dean Witter had been bedeviled by its
earlier attempts to create a homegrown market data system, using
workstations running IBM's OS/2 operating system and --
possibly -- satellite delivery. That quest was eventually
abandoned last fall (Inside Market Data, Nov. 15, 1991). The
firm then opted to look at solutions driven by the market data
vendors, a process that ended with the selection of ILX and
Sears Technology Services (STS), a subsidiary of Sears Roebuck.

  STS sells voice, video and data services internally to other
Sears units, according to Gary Weis, STS senior vice president of
networking and technology. Weis also has management
responsibility for Sears Communications Co., which sells the same
services to non-Sears companies. He says that SCC is "actively
engaged" in discussions with another brokerage firm that would
bring a DWR competitor onto the network.

  As part of its plan, DWR, the brokerage arm of Sears' Dean
Witter Financial Services Group Inc., will expand its use of the
terrestrial facilities provided by STS, operator of one of the
largest SNA networks in the country (see box). The firm already
uses STS for branch applications, and to provide local
concentrators to handle market data provided by Quotron and ADP.

  "We're glad it's over," says Fred Frohne, executive vice
president and director of information services at DWR. "It was
like giving birth."

  Dean Witter's choice of STS isn't surprising, given the
corporate relationship and the fact that STS is an incumbent of
sorts. But Frohne insists the selection was based on
functionality and sound business reasons rather than family ties
alone.

  "The reason we're using STS is because it's got good pricing,
the right kind of uptime, and over the years the network managers
have become very sensitive to the nature of Dean Witter's
business." Other Sears units on the network are Coldwell Banker,
the real-estate brokerage; Allstate Insurance; Discover Card
merchants; and Sears Payment Systems. Non-Sears customers include
Radio Shack, Goodyear and major petroleum companies.

  "The arrangement within Sears is that where it is the prudent
thing to do, Sears will provide the network services," Frohne
says. "That's not something cast in stone if, in fact, there is a
reason to make a business case to do something the network cannot
provide."

  The rollout is already underway with the installation of 12 386
and 486 IBM PS/2 broker workstations at DWR's branch at 2 World
Trade Center in New York. It will continue with "a dozen or 15
additional locations -- the shakedown group" -- that will allow
the firm to identify and deal with installation difficulties
before moving on to the rest of the 350 branches. According to
Frohne, DWR will continue with the full-scale rollout in the
fourth quarter. Sources say the project is scheduled for
completion by the end of 1993.

  The new network contract covers data only. The firm's voice
vendor is Sprint, managed by STS; the hoot 'n' holler vendor is
AT&T, and DWR already has plans to move its shoutdown services
onto the STS network. There are no plans for video near-term,
though STS's T.1 and T.3 backbone has sufficient bandwidth to
handle video, Frohne says.

                        Back at the Branch

  "The big change is that we took market data and will be
broadcasting that through the network," says DWR senior vice
president George Ross. The ILX ticker plant on Fulton Street in
lower Manhattan will be connected directly to the Sears SNA wide
area network. "It will save us money. The bottom line is we could
have packaged that with a quote vendor, but STS is so big they
can deliver the package more cost-effectively than the vendor
can."

  DWR currently employs a mix of Quotron and ADP market data
terminals for account executives on a broadcast-only basis. The
data passes from the vendor's network into regional DWR
concentrators, and from there on to individual branches via the
STS network.

  Until now, DWR brokers have been using the STS SNA network for
applications related to broker-client services rather than market
data. These applications include account information and
servicing, and internal research. Even so, the volume from the
350 branches is enormous. More than a million inquiries per day
arrive via the STS WAN at the Sears data center in Dallas,
according to Frohne, making it one of the largest such IBM-based
data centers in the country. The new agreement with STS will "add
traffic for opening accounts and placing orders for the
branches," Frohne says.

  In the firm's official announcement of the branch system, DWR
promised the introduction of "a broad range of new services for
account executives and clients. These new features will include
portfolio management tools, spreadsheet packages, word
processing, expanded market data, and market and research alerts,
along with many other applications customized for Dean Witter."
Despite this official pronouncement, Frohne says the network as
such "will not play a role in new product development." STS will
not be adding capacity for the new DWR applications, but he says
"they will absorb us within the network."

  The new implementation on the STS network will increase the
speed of access for DWR brokers from a 14.4 kilobit/second
multipoint access, to point-to-point 56 or 64 kilobit/second
access.

            Sears Has Everything -- Except Satellites

  STS has a 100 percent terrestrial T.1 and T.3 backbone for its
nationwide IBM System Network Architecture network. Frohne says
that STS has "the largest single image SNA network out there."
There are some "400,000 logical devices connected to that
network," he says, including PCs, mainframes, minis, printers and
fax machines.

  Ross says redundancy is built into the network. He describes
the network as a "family of T.1s" linked to more than 50 major
nodes throughout the U.S. These nodes, in turn, are serviced by
T.3 circuits linking the major processing centers in Schaumburg,
Ill., Columbus, Ohio, and Dallas. Columbus has 15 large 900-
series IBM mainframes, according to Ross; it is the central site
for Sears' Discover and merchant applications, and is the backup
for Dean Witter. DWR's main processing facility is in Dallas.

  "It's like a universal virtual network," Ross says. "If we lose
any one data center, the users will never know it happened. I am
of the opinion we could lose two of the three and still be all
right."

                        By Land or by Air?

  DWR's relationship with STS goes back to 1984, when the broker
first began to use STS for the firm's branch applications
networking.

  DWR never considered another terrestrial alternative. But the
firm did look closely at end-to-end satellite services provided
by market data vendors, including ADP's Brokerage Information
Systems Group and ILX. Quotron and U.K. market data vendor
Reuters were also considered, as was Hughes Network Systems Inc.,
a vendor of very small aperture terminal (VSAT) networks.

  "We really did look at all of the networking options," says
DWR's Ross. "Satellite is excellent, it works very nicely.... The
bottom line is there were no dollars to be saved by going off the
reservation to a satellite environment. STS developed their
network with Dean Witter first because we were the most sensitive
users to downtime in the world of Sears. If they could make us
clowns happy, then they knew they had a product that can meet the
needs of the rest of Sears."

  DWR explored satellite options through market data vendors,
thereby underlining the importance of a networking strategy for
these players. Ross says Quotron had no satellite option, but "we
addressed totally unbundling all services" -- so this shortcoming
didn't rule out Quotron for the rest of the pie.

  "We went to Hughes directly," he says, "but if we had chosen to
go satellite, it made more sense to go through ADP -- the reason
being we would have had to set up a group to manage that process
rather than leave it in the hands of the vendor." Under an accord
signed last fall, ADP provides some customers with two-way
satellite communications using Hughes' VSAT technology. Ross says
Dean Witter looked at Reuters "casually" -- although Reuters had
proposed a pilot using its Satellite Delivery System 3 (SDS3)
network.

  "We would not look at any terrestrial solution offered by
anybody else," Ross says. "Being very candid, it was not an
option we had. And they [STS] do not offer satellite. Really, it
[satellite vs. terrestrial] is kind of a wash, to be very candid
with you. It's an iffy type advantage. Satellite means antennas,
roof rights on buildings, and there are dollars involved with
that. So it's a wash overall, nationwide."

  "In any given LATA, [Local Access Transport Area], we have
sufficient density to make long-distance and local access less
expensive than using VSAT technology," says Weis. "Because of the
size and density of the network, it is net cheaper."

NEW YORK TELEPHONE SET TO BRING T.1 ISDN
TO WALL STREET USERS AS EARLY AS NEXT MONTH

  New York Telephone is on the verge of receiving approval for a
tariff filed for ISDN Primary Service that would bring T.1 ISDN
capacity to Wall Street for the first time. If the New York State
Public Service Commission approves the filing, the service could
become publicly available as soon as July 24.

  If approved, ISDN Primary Service would join Basic Service as
New York Telephone's two-headed ISDN offering. The Centrex-
equivalent Basic Rate ISDN, which is comprised of two B channels
and one D channel, has been available since April 1991, but has
been almost invisible on Wall Street. Only Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., and Citibank -- the three
participants in the recently completed New York State ISDN
trials -- have experimented with the technology in any depth.

  These trials have, however, suggested the variety of
applications that ISDN can bring to the desktop. Shearson, the
most ambitious participant in the trial, tested branch training
applications that take advantage of ISDN's capability to deliver
voice and data simultaneously: both the trainer and the student
can look at and make changes to the same screen while they talk
on the telephone at the same time.

  Merrill Lynch experimented with ISDN as a way to more closely
control telecommunications costs. And Citibank implemented an
international video teleconferencing application using the
facilities of Teleport Communications Group's TC Systems unit.

  New York Tel has been hampered by the scarcity of its ISDN
switching technology. According to Jean Altenau, staff director
for ISDN Product Development for NYNEX's Telesector Resources
Group, Basic Service is available only from Central Offices in
Manhattan on West 42nd Street; in White Plains, N.Y.; and in
Garden City, Long Island. Both Basic Service and Primary Service
can carry integrated voice and data over a single ISDN line, and
both flavors eliminate the need for a modem of any kind.

  NYNEX has remained reluctant to announce a more specific ISDN
deployment schedule. "Right now, deployment is limited," Altenau
says. "But we expect additional deployment through 1992 and
1993." Mary Cooke, associate director for NYNEX ISDN Market
Planning, told a recent forum: "As money comes rolling in, we'll
be able to increase our deployment 50-fold."

                  Primary Service: A Definition

  NYNEX's ISDN Primary Service operates at 1.544 megabits/second,
typically broken down into 23 64 kilobits/second B channels for
transmission and one 64 kilobits/second D channel for signaling;
or 24 B channels under the control of a D channel in another
Digital Transport Facility (DTF), defined in the filing as "a 1.5
Mbps facility between a subscriber's premises network interface
and a port." The B channels can carry voice or data, while the D
channel carries the out-of-band signaling necessary to control
its associated B channels.

  The Primary Service's circuit-switched voice provides digitized
speech or voiceband data access for features like Direct Inward
Dialing, Outward Dialing, WATS long-distance service, and 800
services. The service also allows subscribers to utilize the D
channel for signaling to dynamically allocate B channels on a
per-call basis.

  The full 24 channels will be available at what New York Tel
calls the "suitably equipped" CO's DS-1 port termination via
dedicated lines. According to the New York Telephone filing,
subscribers to the Primary Service have the option to use either
"a subset or all of the channels at the port termination or [to]
have multiple ISDN Primary Service ports to connect to multiple
DTF's."

                         The Commitments

  New York Tel will require a minimum service period of 12 months
"subject to the availability of facilities and node software and
hardware"; additional commitments must also be for a minimum of
another 12 months. All subscriber-based equipment must conform to
the published AT&T and Northern Telecom ISDN Primary Service
specifications.

  One caveat in the filing pertains to the controversial
Automatic Number Identification feature plaguing public utility
commissions everywhere. The filing warns: "The subscriber may not
resell, or otherwise provide to third parties any information
obtained through the use of the Calling Line Identification
feature."

  Pricing is complex. On a per-month basis, the cost of a Digital
Transport Facility to the subscriber will be $332.25 for "the
first half-mile or fraction thereof"; and then an additional $300
for each DTF to the same premises. Ports with 23 B channels and
one D channel are priced at an additional $595 per month, and
Interoffice Termination is priced at either $595 (23 B channels
and 1 D channel) or $545 (24 B channels).

  As for interoffice facility charges, rates are based on NYNEX
Superpath 1.5 megabits/second service. There are optional monthly
charges for backup D channels ($50 each); calling line
identification per port ($150); and channel configuration per
trunk group established ($10).

  If subscribers choose a three-year contract, they will save a
few dollars per feature. DTF, for example, would cost $315.65
rather than $332.25. A five-year contract would reduce that same
charge more substantially, to $299 per month. There will be
nonrecurring charges for service establishment ($250); for any
change from NYNEX FLEXPATH to ISDN Primary Rate Service ($225);
and for any changes to service ($200).

  So far no one has intervened -- a sign that perhaps not even
advocacy groups understand the full implications of ISDN service.
Given the lack of ISDN-capable COs, and NYNEX's reluctance to
move more quickly than its customers, it will be up to Wall
Street firms to create a future that includes ISDN capabilities.

MCDONALD COMPLETES ROLLOUT
OF 29-BRANCH VOICE DATA NETWORK

  McDonald & Company Securities Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio, has just
gone live with a final network link to its Jersey City, N.J.,
office, the last of 29 branches to be tied into an integrated
voice-data network. The new network supports some 400 users at
branches in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.

  The McDonald rollout illustrates why securities firms are
becoming reluctant to turn over their network destiny to market
data vendors, and how easy it can be to underestimate network
management demands. It also underscores the importance of
integrated voice-data networks in driving down firmwide
telecommunications costs.

  At the same time as they were implementing a new networking
strategy, McDonald took the opportunity of swapping out its
quote-terminal system for a new one developed with New York
systems integrator American Real-Time Services Inc. The ARTS
system, which handles branchwide distribution and display of
Reuters' Marketfeed 2000 digital data feed, replaced some 290 ADP
FS One terminals at McDonald and 75 Quotron Q1000 terminals at
Gradison & Co., a firm based in Cincinnati and owned by McDonald.

                          Who's Driving?

  The driving forces behind the switch to integrated service were
both cost and speed. ARTS and McDonald consider the new network
unique because it will carry three types of data simultaneously:
voice (eight kilobits/second); hoot 'n' holler (16
kilobits/second); and market data in the form of news and quotes
(32 kilobits/second). Boris Gettig, vice president of management
information systems at McDonald, says that voice-data integration
has meant savings "on the order of $250,000 per year."

  McDonald was using ADP Brokerage Information Systems Group's
terrestrial data network for back-office purposes. The ADP data
network is based on analog 9.6 kilobit/second data circuits.
McDonald was using half that capacity to receive market data and
half for back-office traffic.

  Using the ADP analog network, a broker in a branch could
connect to a Tandem Computer Corp. processor in Cleveland and
pull up customer accounts, but response time was sluggish: up to
17 seconds for a full screen to be painted on a broker's
terminal. Once a broker hit the carriage return to make his or
her request, the request data was sent to ADP's data center in
Mount Laurel, N.J., for processing; on to McDonald's Tandem in
Cleveland; and then back out to the branch office. The new,
higher-speed network was able to cut response time to an average
of five seconds, with some requests taking only from two to three
seconds.

                           It's a No-No

  "Neither ADP nor Quotron would allow us to stick an arbitrary
protocol on their network," says Gettig. For McDonald's network
link to ADP, the firm had developed a special program running on
the Tandem to convert standard 3270 data into the proprietary
protocol necessary for transmission to the ADP data center in
Mount Laurel. Nonetheless, according to Gettig, "The protocol
conversion was pretty ragged."

  "With our own new network, we have the flexibility of linking a
PC LAN into the WAN if we want to," he says, "but [ADP and
Quotron] wouldn't allow us to. Essentially, their networks are
used for doing quotes, and other securities firms are using the
same lines to get to the same places. They are quote vendors and
not communications vendors. Both Quotron and ADP said we'd have
to encapsulate our protocols within theirs."

  AT&T lost out after the analog hoot 'n' holler network came
under close scrutiny. McDonald was also paying for long-distance
AT&T circuits -- a pair of 9600 baud digital circuits -- for data
delivery to ADP for back-office processing, a system distinct
from the analog voice network.

  The new integrated network configuration will give McDonald "a
lot of things we never had in past," says Joe Perez, a McDonald
vice president and assistant manager for communications, "like
dial backup in case the network goes down. We have total control
of remote loopback testing, and signal gain and loss testing.
Before, we were pretty much at the mercy of AT&T to tell us
whether or not the circuit was good, and you know how that
goes -- if something goes wrong, it turns into a finger-pointing
match. Now we can do the trouble-shooting and provide the
solution ourselves."

  The switch to digital also means better quality for McDonald
using less bandwidth. The 16 kilobit/second of bandwidth required
for compressed voice provides "much better quality with full 64k
analog circuit," according to Perez. "It's super -- that was a
surprise to us."

  The digital circuits running from the firm's main office in
Cleveland to the branches are T.1s provided by Litel
Communications Inc. International, a regional long-distance
provider that will carry traffic at 56 kilobits/second. The
McDonald segment of the network uses X.25 connections; a packet
assembler/disassembler (PAD) in each branch is linked with an
Infotron 8020 multiplexer that communicates with another Infotron
mux located in the branch.

  Gradison, in contrast, is reliant upon TCP/IP and its link
between the UNIX-based LAN supporting broker workstations in
Cincinnati and the Internet Protocol: a Proteon router at
Gradison in Cincinnati is connected via two 56 kilobit/second
lines to a Proteon router in Cleveland.

                        Switch and Cut Bait

  At first, McDonald installed four PC-based Level 2 packet
switches, at a cost of just $15,000 each, as the center cloud.
The firm bought Netrix X.25 software. But the PC-based packet
switches were too slow to keep up with the UNIX processors in the
branches. As a result, the X.25 connection was cleared, and the
branch users were forced to log on again.

  "The whole circuit went down," Gettig says. "It was as bad as
going up with a pair of cutters and cutting the line. We couldn't
find the problem, because it was difficult to tell where the
clear was coming from."

  To solve their problem, McDonald executives invested in Level 3
hardware. That doesn't come cheap -- the Infotron Streamline 2550
cost McDonald in the neighborhood of $140,000.

  McDonald worried the Streamline 2550 might be overkill. But it
has worked well when combined with network-monitoring equipment.
Network management personnel at McDonald are now able to see
where the clears are coming from via a graphical map displayed at
headquarters in Cleveland: they can then run tests to a given
branch, and Litel can loop back to a different part of the fiber
circuit until they are able to isolate the origin of the problem.

  "One of the main things we learned was not to try to scrimp on
the cost of the hardware," Gettig says. "We got halfway rolled
out -- six or eight branches -- and that thing [the PC-based
solution] was enough to drive us out of a job. We ended up taking
a big hit from the small inexpensive network. Nobody could put a
dollar value on management and troubleshooting, but those are the
things that gave us sleepless nights. We knew there were problems
but we couldn't find them."

INTERSTATE/JOHNSON LANE ADDS
FUNCTIONS TO VSAT NETWORK

  Charlotte, N.C.-based Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. has begun to
migrate its hoot 'n' holler branch application from AT&T land
lines to the ADP satellite network the firm has already installed
for market data delivery to more than 62 branches in the
Southeast. The regional broker believes the hoot 'n' holler move
to satellite will save the firm $150,000 per year once it's
completed this summer.

  Interstate has set up three sites to test the ADP network in
anticipation of a branch-wide hoot 'n' holler rollout scheduled
for Aug. 1, according to Glenn Mabry, first vice president,
telecommunications.

  Interstate was the first ADP customer to receive the FS Partner
data service via very small aperture terminal (VSAT) network, a
conversion process that began in October 1991 and was completed
this past February.

  Interstate/Johnson Lane was also the first ADP customer to use
Personal Earth Stations from Hughes Network Systems (HNS) as part
of Hughes' exclusive agreement with ADP for VSAT network
services. The ADP contract gives Hughes exclusive rights to the
installation and maintenance of the earth stations at ADP's
clients.

  Metromedia Communications Corp., a long distance vendor based
in East Rutherford, N.J., will remain the primary vendor for
Interstate's basic voice service; the firm has no immediate plans
to implement video on the network.

                        Making the Switch

  As part of the firm's switch to a VSAT network, an HNS Personal
Earth Station has been installed at each Interstate branch in
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. A Direct Indoor Unit
(DIU) interfaces with the VSAT dish to deliver both the hoot 'n'
holler application and FS Partner to the IBM PS/2 servers in
place at Interstate branch offices.

  The ADP/Hughes satellite network can support speeds of 512
kilobits/second outbound and 128 kilobits/second inbound.
Interstate, however, doesn't expect its traffic to exceed 64
kilobits/second. The ADP network traffic is downlinked to the HNS
hub in Spring Creek, N.Y. The company will not be incorporating
its own information with ADP's market data.

  In 1989, the Interstate/Johnson Lane network was 100 percent
terrestrial, with long distance lines provided primarily by AT&T
and MCI. But I/JL was plagued by what Mabry calls "the
vulnerability of land lines" -- mainly downtime and noise on the
line. Another factor in its switch to VSAT was speed of
installation and/or relocation. With AT&T any change or new
installation generally took from 60 to 90 days; I/JL is trying to
negotiate a 30-day turnaround time with ADP.

  Interstate examined three VSAT options: Avdata Systems in
Atlanta; Hughes on its own without ADP; and ADP using Hughes'
technology. Despite the cost savings that comes from integrated
voice and data, the four chief criteria for selection, according
to Mabry, were quality service; guaranteed uptime (with automatic
dialup backup); the ability to integrate voice and data; and "the
flexibility of relocation or installation."

  ADP had both feet in the door. The company had been
Interstate/Johnson Lane's back-office vendor since 1985, and its
market data provider since 1986. "We needed to get their service
into us in the most efficient way," Mabry says. "They came [to
the VSAT network discussions] as our quote service vendor."
Interstate conducted a pilot with ADP and Hughes before making
its final choice.

  Interstate is one of several regional firms exploring VSAT for
branch communications. In 1988, before ADP's deal with Hughes,
Edward D. Jones & Co., a regional broker based in St. Louis,
awarded HNS a $30 million contract for a VSAT network expected to
reach more than 2,000 broker sites by the end of this year.
Hughes is also installing a 400-node network for A.G. Edwards.
Additionally, ADP is in the early stages of a network rollout
with regional broker J.C. Bradford & Co., based in Nashville.

  "They are more receptive to satellite technology," says Pradman
Kaul, president of Hughes Network Systems, "because they all have
the same requirements: rapid response time, high-quality
transmission of data, flexibility if they move or install a new
office, and specialized applications like hoot 'n' holler."

AMID UNCERTAINTY, CTFI BUILDS
BACKUP FOR WALL STREET FIRMS

  Three years after 14 Wall Street Telecommunications Association
member firms announced plans to develop a hot site in case of a
network disaster, no contingency planning facility has been
built, and the vendor selected by the WSTA group has been forced
to market its facility with nothing more than the consortium's
endorsement to show for its winning proposal.

  Contingency Trading Facility Inc., based at MetroTech Center in
Brooklyn and majority-owned by competitive access provider
Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc., was selected as the "winner" of
the request for proposal issued by the Disaster Recovery Hot Site
consortium. The consortium was formed in 1989 by the 14 WSTA
member firms, but now that CTFI has been selected as the hot site
vendor, the group agreed that its work was complete and has
disbanded. CTFI has won an endorsement with no explicit dollar
value from a WSTA group that no longer exists.

  "The award allowed us the right to go out and market to the
WSTA member firms," MFS vice president Kathy Perone says. "But it
did not guarantee any number of seats, or that the 14 WSTA firms
would use the site. We got an endorsement, and we are marketing
to all financial firms."

  "The [WSTA] group basically looked at their experience with
Wall Street requirements," says a key member of the Hot Site
consortium. "We looked at the proposal, and the recommendation
was based on networking flexibility and the location of the
facility. Based on those, CTFI had the wherewithal -- they were
better than the closest alternative."

  At least one member of the Hot Site consortium has committed to
a rival that "lost" in the bidding process -- Exchange Resources
Inc. of Minneapolis.

  "It was difficult to understand what it is you would win," says
one of the "losers" in the RFP process. "It was extremely
nebulous throughout, and we have since found there was nothing to
be won -- nothing to win."

  The purpose of the contingency facility is to provide
alternative network routing and access to market data feeds for
traders should a disaster cripple their own facilities. Though
MFS is claiming that 55 percent of the seats at the as-yet
unbuilt CTFI MetroTech Center contingency site have been sold,
Wall Street firms have been required only to put down deposits to
reserve seats.

  A "shared" seat at the facility costs $4,000 per year; a "semi-
shared" seat is $6,000 per year; and a "dedicated seat" is priced
at $11,000 per year. Contracts are for a minimum of three years.
Dedicated seats are 100 percent guaranteed under all
circumstances. Sharing guarantees subscribers will have access
to, at worst, a percentage of the seats contracted for: 50
percent for semi-dedicated; 25 percent for shared.

  CTFI plans to go live before year end. Other than the original
14 consortium firms, CTFI principal Jim Loizidez says his company
is in discussions with "another 25 WSTA companies" and that CTFI/
MFS are "now prospecting about 75 customers" in all.

  "They are actually waiting for the Wall Street community to
come in with some commitments," says the source. "I don't know if
there are enough to go forward.... I believe we are basically on
hold while we wait for the CTFI to formalize commitments."

  For $2,000 each, the 14 Hot Site consortium firms were able to
formulate requirements for a site that few felt they could afford
on their own. But it is also clear that needs have changed in the
time since the Hot Site consortium surveyed WSTA members and
first disseminated its RFP in October 1991. The RFP was designed
to delineate common requirements, but in fact MFS has been
deluged with requests for additional data feeds and
customization.

  Customers are asking for things outside the scope of the
original RFP: additional market data services, connections to
international carriers, access to their long-distance
providers -- and even storage space and the ability to bring
nontrading functions to the CTFI facility.

  Ironically, one of the prime beneficiaries of the "endorsement"
from the WSTA member firms will be MFS competitor New York
Telephone, which operates the Securities Industry Automation
Network. According to one source, MFS has already ordered some
200 lines from New York Tel; MFS has also announced a partnering
agreement with NYNEX Computer Services to provide consulting
services for disaster recovery to Wall Street customers. New York
Tel is even involved in designing the CTFI facility.

                           The Hot Site

  At the Brooklyn Hot Site, CTFI will provide a 60-button V Band
Corp. digital turret at each seat, with market data delivered by
a Reuters Triarch 2000 data distribution system. CTFI will
provide the Reuters Selectfeed and Telerate TDPF feeds for each
trader position. Quotron, ADP and Telekurs are under evaluation
to provide equities data.

  There are plans for five separate trading rooms of 50 seats
apiece at the facility in Brooklyn, each with a Novell local area
network connected to a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputer;
the VAX will act as feed handler and local controller for
incoming and outgoing communications.

  Subscribers will also have the option to connect feeds from
their back-office operations to traders' temporary stations in
Brooklyn via a System Network Architecture (SNA) gateway to the
DEC VAX. This allows for the interconnection of the traders'
back-office information to the CTFI VAX, accessible from
workstations.

  Individual voice and data lines can be re-routed through the
fiber networks of MFS or the Securities Industry Association
Network. According to Perone, MFS can switch the lines from the
New York Telephone Central Office (CO) that feeds the trader "and
shoot it into Brooklyn."

                          Discount Data

  CTFI also has the capability to pre-configure up to five
additional data feeds available through Reuters' Triarch 2000.
"We end up getting it cheaper than the traders' would
themselves," Loizides says, "because market data vendors realize
this is a backup site and they are giving us discounted feeds."

  Perone says the setup gives CTFI/MFS the ability "to turn them
on within 24 hours." The MFS network has direct fiber connections
from the company's midtown and downtown New York locations to the
MetroTech Center in Brooklyn.

  "The important thing is they are both fiber-optic-based
networks," Perone says. "That allows us to essentially look at a
circuit in two directions. If something happens, you can swing
the broken location to a third location. The Digital Cross-
Connect System acts as a controller -- it essentially allows you
to take one end of a private line and reconfigure to a third
location, such that traffic would appear to be transmitting over
the normal path. The duplicate services in Brooklyn would look
exactly like the traders are used to."

DOW JONES, NYNEX PURSUE PLAN
FOR WALL STREET VIDEO SERVICE

  Dow Jones and NYNEX aren't about to let the failure of Reuters'
TV 2000 in 1990 to stop them from exploring the market for both
store-and-forward and real-time video programming on Wall Street.
In an ambitious test of video over fiber already well into the
planning stages, both companies are trying to surmount the
technical and programming difficulties inherent in delivering
broadband services.

  The resulting product is expected to allow users of market data
to use digitized video in much the same way they use data now. If
Dow Jones and NYNEX are successful, users would be able to
monitor, store, and retrieve both real-time video and historical
video databases. Digital video with the properties of data could
open up a new revenue stream for network and market data vendors
on Wall Street -- and a new way of monitoring developments in the
financial world.

  For NYNEX, the project is the first thrust into video
programming since the restraints of the Modified Final Judgment
were lifted by an appeals court. For Dow Jones, it means a
chance to turn a glaring weakness in its Information Services
operation -- television programming -- into a presence in video
on Wall Street.

                           In the Field

  A prototype testing both the NYNEX network and the Dow Jones
programming is scheduled to be up and running by the end of the
year; if all goes well, a field test is set for the third quarter
of 1993. The operation will be based at Dow Jones headquarters at
One World Financial Center in New York, and at NYNEX's Science
and Technology Laboratory in White Plains, N.Y. The project will
be managed on the NYNEX side by its Telesector Resources Group
(TRG) as part of Dow Jones Television, headed by senior vice
president Peter Skinner, who reports to Dow Jones president Peter
Kann.

  The test will rely at first on "standard DS-1 connections,"
according to Joe DeMauro, director of new product development at
TRG. In the near-term, that means deploying the existing
dedicated point-to-point facilities of NYNEX Superpath, the 1.2
to 256 kilobit/second packet-switching service marketed by New
York Telephone. With Superpath, users have the capability of
establishing either permanent or temporary switched virtual
circuits between locations.

  DeMauro does expect the pilot will move to the 1.544 megabit
ISDN Primary Rate Interface -- once Primary Rate ISDN is tariffed
by the New York State Public Service Commission. A decision is
expected by July 24 (see story, page 1). Superpath relies on
dedicated facilities at two locations; ISDN PRI, by contrast, is
a switched connection that can be delivered to anyone with an
equivalent facility. ISDN will also allow for an end-to-end
digital connectivity.

  These networks will permit VCR-quality broadcasts: a step down
from broadcast quality, but probably good enough for a first-
generation business-to-business broadcast. The good news is that
the pilot will not suffer from "motion artifacts," the jumpiness
that often plagues video teleconferencing at lower baud rates. At
the slower data rates, any motion at all makes it look to the
viewer as though the signal itself has broken up, and the quality
of the picture is muddy compared to a network broadcast.

  The two companies have broken out the project into three
pieces: production of the programming; storage and distribution;
and delivery of the video service at the customer's premises. Dow
Jones will take care of the video programming piece, while NYNEX
will handle storage and distribution. The line has not yet been
clearly drawn as to how customer premises will be handled -- or
by whom. Should the service go commercial, Dow Jones expects that
third-party business alliance partners will perform the
integration function within the customer's premises -- as they
now do with other data feeds. As yet, no customer sites for the
prototype or the pilot have been announced.

  "The first step is technological," Peter Skinner says. "We have
to figure out how one transports a video feed over fiber in a
fashion that allows users to manipulate, store, and recall
programming the way you do now in an electronic database. We have
to figure out how one digitizes, stores, and retrieves video
information."

                          Easy Answers?

  NYNEX and Dow Jones have the advantage of trying to answer
those questions at a moment when international standards for the
transmission of digital video have stabilized. For store-and-
forward video, NYNEX will rely on the groundwork of the Motion
Picture Experts Group and its MPEG standard.

  For real-time video, DeMauro expects the partners will turn to
the international H.261 CCITT standard for transporting video to
codecs, the compression/decompression devices that are analogous
to modems for data. Thus, the test will benefit from standard
interfaces to codecs, and compatibility with the hardware and
software of a variety of manufacturers of video teleconferencing
products and services.

  NYNEX has to tread lightly when it comes to issues of content,
considering that cable and telephone companies are still barred
by federal law (the 1984 Cable Act) from entering the business of
the other; NYNEX has nicely side-stepped any immediate
controversy by leaving the programming side to Dow Jones. The
technical hurdles pertaining to delivery of video-on-demand
services are nothing compared to the programming issues Dow Jones
will have to conquer to grow the pilot into a commercial service.

  Dow Jones failed in its attempts to acquire Financial News
Network Inc. last year when the National Broadcasting Co.
absorbed FNN into the CNBC cable channel. Dow Jones may be an
information powerhouse in most media, but video has limped along
as a weak sibling. All that Dow Jones has to show on the
television side under its Dow Jones Television unit is the limpid
Wall Street Journal Report, a syndicated television show usually
shown at off-hours over the weekend on just 70 stations. With a
weekly magazine format, that half-hour show is broadcast by only
17 people total, a staff that also has responsibility to deliver
syndicated inserts into the broadcasts of news shows in local
markets and in Japan.

                      Are You Experienced?

  This dearth of video experience is daunting, considering that
Skinner is talking about Dow Jones providing everything from
"real-time breaking news to analytical, historical, archival, and
other programming we haven't thought of."

  "We have a lot of ideas about programming," he says. "Part of
our effort is to experiment with various types of programming."
Skinner said the "issue is open" as to relying on outside
suppliers of programming for the pilot. Of course, Dow Jones has
the option of drawing on the other parts of the company to
provide programming, but then so did Reuters when it came to the
defunct TV 2000.

  Exploration and exploitation of a new technology are two
different things, and video to date has been a minefield on Wall
Street, in large part because programming is a black hole. Don't
be surprised if Dow Jones and NYNEX fall into the programming
chasm between prototype and pilot. Jumping the technology hurdles
could turn out to be the easy part.

  Telekurs (North America) Inc. has increased the bandwidth of

  Telekurs (North America) Inc. has increased the bandwidth of
its Telekurs Ticker Service digital data feed from 19.2
kilobits/second to 56 kilobits/second. The increased speed brings
the Ticker feed up to a level comparable to Reuters' Marketfeed
2000 and PC Quote Inc.'s HyperFeed. The move was made because of
a planned expansion of the Ticker's content and "the beginnings
of a bandwidth problem," in the words of Steve Williams,
Telekurs' product manager for real-time systems.

  The seven Regional Bell Operating Companies and three
independent telcos have endorsed plans for local frame-relay and
switched multi-megabit data services. The RBOCs (Ameritech, Bell
Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Bell, Southwestern Bell
Telephone, and US WEST) and the independents (Cincinnati Bell,
GTE, and Southern New England Telephone) have given their support
to an agreement similar to one already announced by long-distance
carriers AT&T, Sprint, MCI, and BT North America. Frame-relay
service will begin this summer in the Ameritech region, and
multi-megabit transmission will be available on GTE facilities in
Los Angeles.

  Teleport Communications Group has appointed Charles "Chip"
Cleary as vice president of national markets. Cleary will be in
charge of selling TCG's local services to telecom carriers
nationwide. He had been director of ITT's Communications Services
division, and, most recently, he directed Eastern and Midwestern
sales for Metromedia Communications.

  Users of Instinet Corp.'s Order Management System have found it
can be used as a continuous crossing network, performing some of
the same functions as Morgan Stanley & Co.'s MatchPlus Patient
Trading system, according to sources at Grantham, Mayo, Van
Otterloo & Co., a test site for the system.

  If nothing else, the recent Chicago flood has forced another
round of CAP-think among telephone operating companies. "There
are two ways to deal with a bear that's in your territory: fight
it at all cost or sit down and have dinner," says Richard
Vanderwoude, president of Central Telephone Co. of Illinois, a
subsidiary of Centel. "Demand is growing so it's not a zero-sum
game. You look for that as a saving grace. We can share the pie
because the pie's getting bigger." Some telephone companies --
RBOC and independent -- consider that philosophy to be heretical.
But Vanderwoude believes the flood will lead "toward multiple
types of services -- two different paths, two different routes.
We'll see more and more of that. Customers want it now."

SAN DIEGO DEFERS VOTE ON PACIFIC BELL PCS DEPLOYMENT AFTER
OPPOSITION

     Pacific Bell suffered one-month setback last week in deploying
digital PCS network in San Diego, in time for Republican National
Convention Aug. 12-14, when City Council deferred action on
approving permits for antenna sites.  Council's 8-1 vote Feb. 12
came after sometimes heated meeting at which opponents of Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology argued that
interference with hearing aids, pacemakers, wheelchairs and
electronic braking systems required city to study issue further
before voting.  City Attorney John Witt told Council in letter that
new Telecom Act restricts local govt. role in determining siting of
radio antennas.  Next meeting is March 19.

     PB blamed setback on "well-orchestrated" campaign by
D.C.-based Wireless Communications Council, headed by Hear-It-Now's
James Valentine, which opposes wide deployment of GSM technology. 
"We're disappointed by the Council vote," PB spokesman Lou Saviano
told us.  City Planning Commission earlier had approved PB's
request, but opponents appealed decision to full Council, which
heard testimony but deferred action.  He said city lawyers advised
Council that new Telecom Act supersedes local authority over such
issues in deploying national PCS system.

     Witt told us Sec. 704 of Telecom Act bans local govt. role in
regulating "placement, construction and modification" of PCS
facilities for frequency emissions, provided equipment complies
with FCC rules.  Lawyers for Council challenged legal opinion, and
law office is continuing to research laws, Witt said.

     PB officials said one-month delay in winning approvals won't
derail plans for network deployment, which includes 12 antenna
sites in city to handle phone calls during convention.  PB paid
$695 million for L.A. and San Francisco licenses and is building
network for Cal., most of Nev. and portion of Ariz.  Company plans
rollout of rest of network by year-end.

     Opponents of GSM technology, operating as Cal. Communications
Council and funded by D.C. group, urged City Council to investigate
technology before approving application.  Saviano described
opposition as "well orchestrated" and said company tried to offset
campaign with "facts and figures" about technology.  Advisory
Commission for Persons with Disabilities in Santa Clara County
wrote letter saying GSM phones create interference with assisted
listening devices (ALDs) in public buildings, and use of phones
could deny ALD users access to services.  Council sought
environmental impact report study as "only way" to resolve dispute
and "protect health and safety."

     In related development, Cal. State Architect Div. access
compliance unit issued letter saying it was preparing statewide
policy to address hearing aid interference.  Michael Mankin, assoc.
architect, said in letter to City Manager Regina Williams: 
"[Agency] suggests, if possible, that you consider this concern
when making any decision on the deployment of PCS 1900/GSM
telephones because they undermined the assistive listening devices
required in assembly occupancies in the State Building Code." 
Mankin said office is working with hearing-impaired community to
develop policy.

     PB plans to open San Diego network ahead of rest of state to
provide wireless services during political convention, even though
most delegates, candidates and media won't have equipment.  Some
from D.C. could use Sprint Spectrum telephones because GSM system
has been operating here since last year.  Phone can make all long
distance calls but won't operate outside 1.9 GHz territory.

AMERITECH, BELL ATLANTIC, SBC LAUNCH OUT-OF-REGION LONG DISTANCE
DRIVE

     Bell Atlantic (BA) and SBC Communications jumped quickly into
out-of-region long distance service last week, filing applications
in 18 states and D.C. to resell services under brand name.  At same
time, Ameritech unveiled aggressive plans for in-region long
distance and signed agreement with WorldTel to carry long distance
calls to cities outside region.  RHCs were first to enter
out-region business, with other companies expected to disclose
plans soon.  IXCs also began seeking state approval to deliver
local services.

     BA became first RHC to seek long distance authority outside
territory, filing applications Feb. 13 in Fla., Ill., N.C., S.C.
and Tex. just 3 days after Telecom Act freed RHCs to operate in new
regions.  SBC followed 2 days later with more extensive filing in
16 states and D.C., and in twist said it will use already
established Cellular One wireless brand name as vehicle for selling
wireline services to existing and new customers.  BA and SBC filed
separate applications in Ill., and SBC plans include many states in
BA's territory.

     BA Communications Pres. Al Binford said 5 states represented
prime opportunities for company as it begins building nationwide
service.  It could be offered on resale basis by end of 2nd
quarter, he said.  "These states are important states," he told us. 
BA plans to seek resale agreements with facilities-based carriers
in 5 states after winning state approval, Binford said.  Other RHCs
haven't indicated plans for filing in states.

     Company pledged last week to move quickly on state front,
saying it would submit applications within 5 days to provide
service in 5 states unidentified until Tues.  Binford said each
state represented significant opportunity for BA to provide service
for its existing customers, such as travelers to Disney World in
Fla.  Proximity of Carolinas to BA's territory, coupled with
existing cellular interests in those 2 states, will enhance BA
brand name in region, he said.  BA also is part of PCS partnership
that has licenses in Tex. and Ill. in addition to other markets.

     Eventually, company plans to have nationwide presence aiming
at targeted audiences rather than all customers, using mix of
advertising, including newspapers, Binford said.  He said first 5
states were "attractive," with large amounts of long distance
calling already in place.  He didn't provide details on timetable
for introducing service in other states.

     BellSouth (BS), which provides service in 3 of 5 states,
welcomed potential competition from neighboring company, saying BA
choice demonstrated "attractive" nature of Southeast for business. 
"We anticipate and expect to have a number of competitors in all
our markets," spokesman Tim Klein said.  BS has strategy for
meeting competition, he said, and has developed "very aggressive"
plan to meet checklist conditions for providing long distance
service in its own 7-state territory.  He said company expects to
meet checklist targets first in Fla., entering market as early as
year-end or early 1997.

     BA has said it expects to seek FCC and state approvals to
offer long distance service in its own territory as soon as rules
are established.  Its quick response to Telecom Act signals its
intention to provide long distance services quickly outside region
while concentrating on in-region checklist, officials said.  Other
RHCs have sketched out brief details of service offerings, most
beginning by providing long distance to cellular customers. 
Ameritech unveiled plans for in-region service but will carry
out-of-region calls through LDDS WorldCom.

          SBC Uses Cellular One Brand for Long Distance

     SBC Communications said it expected applications to be filed
by early this week, with regulatory approvals in 2-3 months. 
States generally are in Northeast and Upper Midwest, with further
plans still undisclosed, official said.  SBC plan relies on brand
name recognition of Cellular One, which has been in existence in
some states for decade.  SBC official said market had sufficient
room for numerous competitors.

     SBC targeted BA territory of Del., D.C., Md., Va. and W.Va.
and plans to seek approval in Conn., Ill., Ind., La., Me., Mass.,
Miss., N.H., N.Y., R.I. and Vt.  "We're building on our out-region
base," Chmn.-CEO Edward Whitacre said.  States either are adjacent
to SBC's 5-state territory or to Cellular One network.  Official
said company has tested Cellular One brand recognition and doesn't
expect obstacles in offering wireline services.  In competition
with BA, SBC official said Cellular One brand has high name
recognition in all 16 states and BA lacks presence or name
recognition in at least 3 of its 5 launch states.  Spokesman Dave
Senay said:  "Competition will be nothing new for SBC or Bell
Atlantic."  In Md., for example, Cellular One and Bell Atlantic
Nynex Mobile are 2 cellular providers.

     SBC began offering long distance to cellular customers on
Cellular One and Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems (SBMS) as soon as
President Clinton signed Telecom Act.  Stanley Sigman, pres.-CEO of
SBMS unit that oversees Cellular One, said company expects
customers to select one company for local, cellular and long
distance.  "We'll build on the customer relationships and brand
recognition that characterize Cellular One," he said.  Goal is to
provide bundled services for all customers.

     In separate announcement, Teleport Communications Group (TCG)
unveiled plans for its Md. operation, saying it will invest $20
million in Baltimore by year-end, with $100 million more in next
several years.  TCG Md. Pres. Larry Bugden said company will add
200 employees to Baltimore operation, with 500 jobs created over
next 5 years by company or subcontractors.  "This is a best step
for us in the Baltimore market," he said.  "We can now capitalize
on the technological capability we already have in place."

                    IXCs Begin Local Filings

     LCI International and AT&T filed at Fla. PSC to provide local
service.  LCI already has approvals from Ill., N.Y., Tex.  It said
applications also are pending in Cal., Md., Mich.  Douglas Kinkoph,
PSC dir.-regulatory affairs, said Fla. is one of several states
"ripe" for entry because of promising markets and favorable
regulations.  AT&T said it would provide service for business and
residential customers in state, depending on negotiations with LECs
there, including BellSouth, GTE, Sprint/United Telephone.  AT&T
disclosed plans to begin offering service by resale agreements with
incumbent carriers, although Chmn.-CEO Robert Allen said company
could build own facilities in some areas.

                 Ameritech Targets In-State Goal

     Ameritech expects to offer in-region landline long distance in
9 to 13 months, with strongest start in Ill. and Mich., CEO Richard
Notebaert said.  Statement came in news conference unveiling long
distance cellular service, to be offered over long distance network
that company has built throughout its 5-state region, he said. 
Ameritech wouldn't provide details on cost of digital, fiber SONET
network or its capacity, but Notebaert said it would be enough for
cellular service.

     Efforts have focused in Chicago and Grand Rapids because
that's where Ameritech had Justice Dept. (DoJ) waiver to offer long
distance service, company said.  But landline service in all its
region will be available in at most 13 months, pending regulatory
approvals, Ameritech said.  Notebaert said adding long distance
capability to local network was not "significant" cost. 
Announcement also marked another plum for LDDS WorldCom, which will
provide out-of-region long distance service for Ameritech
customers, companies said.

     Notebaert declined to reveal how much of long distance market
Ameritech hopes to get.  Company spent much of news conference
touting cellular long distance, saying it would be priced at 16-24
cents per min., 10-35% less than long distance carriers.  Ameritech
said it had signed up 126,000 cellular customers in 36 hours since
service began.

TOP 10 OUTCOMES OF TELECOM ACT

     List prepared by consulting firm A.T. Kearney envisions more
RHC acquisitions and entertainment-telecom conglomerates as result
of Telecom Act.  According to Kearney, new law will:

 1. Force consolidations among interexchange carriers and RHCs.

 2. Give wireless carriers competitive advantage over wireline
carriers.

 3. Push state regulators to open local loop to competition.

 4. Open debate on definition of universal service, including
access to information services.

 5. Turn state regulators into implementers of federal policy.

 6. Postpone rate relief for cable systems until 1999, making cable
"vulnerable" to competitors.

 7. Enhance power of broadcast networks by increasing
cross-ownership opportunities.

 8. Set stage for TV licensees to acquire advanced TV spectrum.

 9. Foster growth of Internet.

10. Pave way for few $100-billion conglomerates to dominate world
market in communications, information, entertainment.

COURT TEMPORARILY BARS ENFORCEMENT OF TELECOM ACT'S INDECENCY LAW

     Despite Justice Dept.'s defense of new law, federal judge in
Philadelphia issued temporary restraining order Feb. 15 barring
govt. from enforcing controversial Internet indecency provision of
Telecom Act while case is before court.  Provision, known as
Communications Decency Act (CDA), prohibits making indecent
material available to minors over Internet.  ACLU and 19 other
groups have challenged provision on basis that law is too broad and
will chill speech on Internet.

     U.S. Dist. Judge Ronald Buckwalter appeared to endorse points
made by both sides in memo accompanying his order.  Buckwalter said
Congress has "compelling interest" in protecting minors and "at
least from the evidence before me, plaintiffs have not convinced me
that Congress has failed to narrowly tailor the CDA."  However, he
also said ACLU and others raised "serious, substantial, difficult
and doubtful questions" about whether CDA's use of word "indecent"
is "unconstitutionally vague."

     Buckwalter issued order several hours after DoJ filed brief
telling court there's no need for such action.  In 60-page brief,
Justice said that ACLU and 19 co-plaintiffs haven't met
extraordinary burdens necessary to block enforcement of new law. 
Buckwalter's decision clears way for 3-judge federal panel --
composed of Buckwalter, Dist. Judge Stuart Dalzell and Dolores
Sloviter, chief judge of 3rd U.S. Appeals Court, Philadelphia -- to
consider merits of CDA.

     In related activity, Sen. Leahy (D-Vt.) said that he has
private support of senators for repeal of law, but that chances are
public support won't materialize.  And 6th U.S. Appeals Court,
Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators of pornographic computer
bulletin board operator in Cal. under Tenn. community standards,
where material from board was downloaded.

                 DoJ Questions ACLU Conclusions

     Justice brief frequently focused on argument that ACLU hadn't
met burden of proof at this stage of case, saying that conclusions
brought by challengers to law haven't been proved sufficiently to
warrant declaring law unconstitutional and because there's no proof
of irreparable injury should law be allowed to take effect.  DoJ
said:  "Plaintiffs fail to show a realistic threat of suppression
of their speech."  Claims that free speech on Internet would be
hurt by new law are "wholly speculative," DoJ said, contending that
ACLU based claims of harm on nothing more than "their own academic
reading of the statute."  Justice said there was ample evidence of
pornographic material on Internet and amount is growing, "far
exceeding anything available prior to the advent of on-line
computer services."  It was concern over that availability that led
to passage of law, Justice contended.

     ACLU argument that indecency portions of law are too vague fly
in face of several years of court decisions, Justice said, noting
that cases involving broadcast language and dial-a-porn touched on
many of same topics.  Congress in passing law "neither purported to
ban, nor effectively ban, on-line indecency in all its various
forms," as ACLU contended, DoJ said.  "Those who create or 'post'
indecent images or texts in cyberspace are on notice that they are
free to do so, so long as they have taken reasonable and
appropriate measures to block access to children effectively." 

     DoJ concluded that Congress knew what it was doing when it
passed Telecom Act, based on extensive record including floor
speeches and hearings.  But one senator, Leahy, said at Washington
news conference same day that many in Congress don't understand
technology.  He was pessimistic that legislation (S-1567) he
introduced with Sen. Feingold (D-Wis.) would get very far.  While
senators privately agree with him on merits of repeal, they're
afraid of 30-sec. attack ads portraying them as proponents of
pornography, Leahy said, adding that he was worried lawmakers are
afraid to stand up for First Amendment.  Leahy said "chilling
effect" on Internet speech already has emerged, citing case of
America Online, which threw off its system Vt. subscriber for using
word "breast."  She was discussing her cancer, Leahy said. 
Americans shouldn't be too quick to criticize Chinese for their
attempts to censor Internet, he said, because much same thing is
happening here.

     Meanwhile, in separate case with similar implications, 6th
U.S. Appeals Court, Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators of
Cal.-based Amateur Action Bulletin Board.  That case dealt with
obscenity, which is illegal, as opposed to indecent material, on
which there's great difference of opinion.  Attorneys for Robert
and Carleen Thomas argued that community standards for obscenity in
Cal. were different from those in Tenn., where postal inspector
downloaded material from Thomas's service.  Thomases were convicted
2 years ago in U.S. Dist. Court, Memphis, of violating obscenity
statutes.

FCC PROPOSES RULES FOR RHCs OFFERING OUT-OF-REGION TOLL SERVICE

     In most significant response so far to Telecom Act, FCC opened
rulemaking Feb. 14 that proposes giving nondominant regulatory
status to RHC affiliates offering out-of-region long distance
service.  As nondominant carriers, RHC affiliates could begin
offering service almost immediately upon filing their tariffs. 
Commission also proposed that if RHCs offer such out-of-region
service directly, rather than through affiliates, they should be
regulated as dominant carriers.

     To be classified as nondominant, RHC affiliate would have to
meet separation conditions outlined in 1985 Competitive Carrier
Order.  Affiliate would have to:  (1) Maintain separate accounting
books.  (2) Have no joint ownership of transmission or switching
facilities with RHC's LEC.  (3) Obtain all RHC exchange company
services at tariffed rates and conditions.  FCC noted that
independent LECs are classified as nondominant in long distance
market and operate under same rules.

     Commission asked for comments on tentative conclusion and said
parties that disagree with plan should offer alternative regulatory
policies.  Action is required by fact that Telecom Act eliminates
MFJ ban on telcos' offering interLATA service.  Nondominant
classification is given to carriers that don't have enough market
power to engage in anticompetitive conduct.

     In notice of proposed rulemaking, Commission said it wants to
"permit efficient and rapid entry" by RHCs but at same time "we
also seek to ensure that sufficient regulatory safeguards are in
place to prevent a BOC from gaining any unfair competitive
advantage."

     Nynex praised FCC plan, Federal Regulatory Affairs Vp Don
Evans saying action "brings Nynex one step closer to offering long
distance telephone users greater choice."

IXCs TO SEEK NICHES AS THEY PREPARE FOR LOCAL, BUNDLED SERVICES
BATTLE

     Second-tier IXCs, like Big 3 counterparts, will accelerate
offerings of local and bundled services as result of passage of
Telecom Act, they said last week.  LDDS WorldCom and Frontier,
which rank 4th and 5th among IXCs, said they will target largest
business customers, taking on RHCs, AT&T, MCI and Sprint in short
run.  No. 6 LCI International said it will seek broader market,
including residential, small, medium and large businesses.  Cable
& Wireless targeted 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500.  All
said they are interested in offering full range of telecom services
and at this stage won't rule out any service or market.

     With own fiber network, LDDS WorldCom will aim for customers
doing at least $500 per month in business, spokesman Gil Broyles
said, and existing customer base will be important.  LDDS filed in
Ill., Mich. and Tex. to enter local market, but he wouldn't
identify first launch state.  He said important factor will be how
LECs set rates for resale capacity.  It also will look at how
states set guidelines to create attractive rates, spokesman said. 
"That's the kind of the next thing that needs to be done," Broyles
said.  LDDS is providing interLATA service for resale to
Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Ameritech, GTE.  Talks are
"continuing" with another unidentified LEC, he said.

     Frontier, with $2.1 billion in 1995 revenue, will compete
"door-to-door" with Big 3 to offer bundled services to Fortune 500
companies, Vp John Purcell said.  "We've got real blood to show"
for combat already, he said.  Frontier jumped to No. 5 ranking
after buying ALC last year and combined companies provide long
distance, local and wireless services to more than 2 million
customers.  Purcell said Telecom Act's requirement for LECs to show
competition before entering long distance created incentive for
Nynex to negotiate favorable rates with Frontier on bundling
services.  He declined to specify where Frontier's next local
services might appear.  However, among 120 sales offices in U.S.,
2/3 are in "opportune" markets for bundled offerings, Purcell said,
and about 40 offices are in regions with regulatory barriers.

     LCI International is likely to pursue broader market,
including residential and business customers of all kinds, and
improve on its $693 million annual revenue, Regulatory Affairs Dir.
Douglas Kinkoph said.  LCI's 200% growth in residential revenue
prompted interest in developing market, he said.  LCI's long
distance marketing, based on what he said were "simple, fair and
inexpensive" services, will be thrust of local offerings, he said. 
LCI now offers flat-rate calling plans and 6-sec. billing option,
unlike competitors, Kinkoph said.  Unlike AT&T, LCI doesn't foresee
building its own facilities to provide local service, he said.

     LCI provides Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile with long distance
service that regional cellular carrier resells to its 3 million
customers.  LCI currently doesn't offer any form of local service,
Kinkoph said.  "No state today is ready to accept local service." 
Spokeswoman Gerry Simone said company is eager for states to set
discount rates.  "Until we know what our price is, we don't know
what our products will be," she said.  In anticipation of state
action, LCI filed at Fla. PSC Feb. 15 to provide local service. 
Kinkoph said Fla. is one of several states "ripe" for entry,
regardless of Telecom Act, because of promising markets and
favorable local regulations.  However, Simone said, should pricing
prove unsatisfactory, LCI also sees options, such as cable, that
could preclude entry into local voice services.  LCI has approvals
from Ill., N.Y. and Tex., with applications pending in Cal., Md.,
Mich.

     Cable & Wireless (C&W) will carve niche by offering bundled
services to 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500, company said. 
C&W has approvals from Conn. and N.Y. and has filed applications in
Cal., Ill. and Tex. to provide local service, company said. 
Official offered rankings for C&W's best opportunities:  (1) N.Y. 
(2) Conn.  (3) Cal., Ill., Tex. tied.  Company launched UniLink
bundled local-long distance in N.Y.C. area.  Official said company
targeted Conn. for greatest investment to offer local services to
businesses.  Conn. PSC recently set Southern New England Telephone
(SNET) resale discounts at 20%-50%, which official said will
trigger aggressive competition.  State granted C&W LEC status,
making company first IXC to buy from SNET.  In Tex., C&W will limit
its resale relationship with Southwestern Bell, citing
dissatisfaction with discount rates and "not very attractive"
economics, official said.

RHCs EXPECTED TO DELAY IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE UNTIL FCC FINISHES
CHECKLIST

     FCC Chmn. Hundt said talks with RHC executives indicate they
won't apply for in-region long distance service until Commission
finishes writing rules for checklist that RHCs must pass, process
that could take about 180 days.  He made comment at Feb. 12 news
conference at which FCC released "task list" of 80 rulemakings
required by Telecom Act of 1996 (see pullout feature in this
issue).  List outlines which bureaus will handle various items and
what deadlines they face, most of them in 1996.  Hundt said
Commission hopes to beat deadlines wherever possible.

     Hundt said FCC is excited about opportunities presented by
Act:  "All along we've wanted the chance to write rules that go to
a competitive market.  Our reach for competition no longer exceeds
our grasp."  Move toward competition means that "in the
communications sector, the era of big government is over," he said. 
Two key goals, he said, are to promote competition rather than
individual competitors and to protect "the public interest
forever."

     Asked how FCC will get work done without budget increase it
had sought, Hundt said it will continue urging Hill to provide more
money but "at the same time, we're hitting the ground running." 
Asked how Commission will get routine work done while it
concentrates on implementation, he said "one answer is, don't try
to do everything the same old way.  We're going to need ideas."

     FCC Wireless Bureau met with industry and public interest
representatives day later to discuss ways to make filing processes
more efficient in light of tight deadlines.  Bureau asked parties
to submit short filings, not seek unnecessary meetings and focus on
proceedings with most immediate deadlines, rather than submitting
information for proceedings that are farther down road.  "Don't
give us the rhetoric and don't paper us to death," FCC Chief of
Staff Blair Levin said.  Industry also can help by developing data
that agency needs to make decisions, bureau staffers said.  Bureau
Chief Michele Farquhar said Bureau in turn will help public by
using new home page on Internet for updates on progress.

     Hundt said other bureaus may hold similar meetings, and
Commission also is considering actions such as page limitations,
open forums where agency staff can question parties more directly,
joint filings when several parties have same view.  As expected,
open video systems proceeding has been moved to Cable Bureau from
Common Carrier Bureau to spread workload.  "Our intent is to have
all the bureaus challenged but not overwhelmed," Hundt said.

     Meanwhile, FCC has received first filing under new Act --
application by CSW Communications, affiliate of utility company
Central & South West Corp., to be classified as "exempt
telecommunications company."  Classification would mean it's bona
fide communications company and thus exempt from Public Utility
Holding Company Act restrictions on offering telecom services. 
Office of Gen. Counsel has 60 days to make determination.

JUSTICE DEPT. SAYS TELCO-CABLE BAN CASE IS MOOT BECAUSE OF TELECOM
ACT

     Passage of Telecom Act makes moot U.S. Supreme Court case
testing constitutionality of telco-cable cross-ownership ban, U.S.
Justice Dept. said in court filing.  However, Bell Atlantic (BA)
argued that case isn't moot because, despite legislation, ban
remains in effect for at least 6 months while FCC sets rules for
telco entry into cable.

     Telecom Act means there's no limit on telcos' building cable
systems in their service areas, Justice Dept. said, although it
acknowledged that Act includes some restrictions such as 10%
maximum ownership of incumbent cable operators.  However, Justice
said limits in Act aren't before Court and haven't been tried at
lower levels, so Supreme Court shouldn't consider them, and
cross-ownership case remains moot.  Brief urged court to vacate
U.S. Appeals Court, Alexandria, Va., decision and order lower court
to dismiss case.

     "Sweeping" Telecom Act means that, "at a minimum, the
legislation has been sufficiently altered so as to present a
substantially different controversy than the one the lower courts
originally decided," Justice said.  "Even if the new legislation
does burden the LECs operating open video systems to a modest
degree... it surely does not burden them in the same fundamental
way" as was argued in appeal and "it would not be appropriate for
this court... to review the constitutionality of the new law, which
has not been the subject of briefing and argument."

     Telecom Act "does not moot this case," BA contended, because
it "substitutes new provisions that keep in place, for at least 6
months, the prohibition on a telephone company's provision of video
programming."  It said Act allows telco open video systems only if
they comply with FCC rules, and "no such rules exist today."  Act
gives FCC 6 months to establish rules and BA said "absence of
regulations in the interim translates into a continuation of the
flat prohibition on speech."

     "Far from mooting the controversy, the Act perpetuates the
controversy," BA said.  "It does no more than require the FCC, at
some point in the future, to take regulatory action that might then
moot this case."  Prolonging ban "will produce irreparable injury"
to telcos, BA said, and there's no major burden on Supreme Court to
issue decision, since case has been briefed, argued and Court has
deliberated on it.

     World of "fierce" competition coupled with reduced govt.
regulation will result from Telecom Act, FCC Comr. Chong said in
speech to FCBA Midwest Chapter Feb. 15 in Chicago.  New law will
let FCC "sweep away regulatory underbrush," she said, noting that
Commission has been "trying to regulate in a Star Trek era, saddled
with Gunsmoke-style regulations."  She predicted that consumers
would have "choices galore":  "Every home, business, school,
library and health care facility will have access to multiple
communications providers, at reasonable prices."  Providers may be
wired, wireless, maybe both, she said:  "Providers will not fit
neatly into traditional categories... Instead, they will likely
evolve into full-service communications companies, offering
consumers a tempting smorgasbord of services."

     Hyperion Telecommunications petitioned FCC Feb. 15 to forbear
from tariff-filing requirements for nondominant carriers, saying
such action is "explicitly authorized" by Telecom Act.  Hyperion is
competitive access provider.  Company noted that Commission had
instituted such policy several years ago but it was thrown out in
1994 by U.S. Supreme Court ruling on AT&T challenge.  Court had
said FCC didn't have enough authority to forbear on requiring
tariff filings.  Hyperion said Telecom Act now gives FCC that
authority.

filing may be deemed "frivolous" if it's "interposed for delay,"
filed without any effort to ascertain facts or based on arguments
that already have been rejected, Commission said.  In past, agency
merely has issued warnings against such filings.  Now, it said,
"all bureaus and offices are encouraged to fully utilize" power to
punish violators, including fines and authority to strike such
pleadings.  Also, said Commission, bureaus "are encouraged to refer
under seal" to gen. counsel names of attorneys making frivolous
pleadings for appropriate action, which could include censure,
suspension or disbarment.

     FCC gave Ameritech access charge flexibility in Chicago and

     FCC gave Ameritech access charge flexibility in Chicago and
Grand Rapids LATAs similar to that approved for Nynex last year. 
Ameritech sought waivers as part of its Customers First plan. 
Waivers will allow company to:  (1) Bulk-bill portions of its
access charges rather than bill on per-min. basis.  (2)
Geographically deaverage one type of access charge called transport
interconnection charge (TIC).  FCC said Ameritech can reduce TIC in
competitive areas but can't raise it in other areas to compensate. 
Actions are expected to result in overall reduction of Ameritech
access charges, possibly in neighborhood of "tens of millions of
dollars," FCC staff member said.  Commission stopped short of
granting full pricing flexibility sought by Ameritech, saying it
would address that issue in future order.  Although action is aimed
at giving Ameritech more flexibility when it faces competition,
rivals say it's premature.  Heather Gold, exec. dir. of Assn. for
Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS), said she's "outraged" by
decision because it lets Ameritech undercut competitors.  She said
that, while Grand Rapids LATA covers about 25% of Mich., Ameritech
could lower access rates selectively only in metropolitan Grand
Rapids, where there's competition from Brooks Fiber.  Action "sets
a bad precedent by inhibiting competition just one week after the
signing of a bill which has the purpose of encouraging
competition," Gold said.  FCC Comr. Barrett said in separate
statement that while he supports decision, action emphasizes need
for comprehensive access charge reform.

     U.S. Dist. Judge Harold Greene, in what could be his last

     U.S. Dist. Judge Harold Greene, in what could be his last
action dealing with AT&T breakup, said in order issued Feb. 8 that
he was "pleased that Congress and the President have now agreed to
set policy for the telecommunications industry."  He said that will
"relieve this court of its stewardship of that industry [telephone
segment of telecom] which, in a sense, it had exercised since
competition was introduced by the judicially ordered breakup of
AT&T."  But Greene said in brief order that his relief "is
mitigated only by a single concern:  That under the bill just
enacted it could turn out that sufficient safeguards do not exist
to prevent domination in the future of the vital information
industry by a few large providers."  He said that if that were to
come about through mergers, acquisitions or other deals, it not
only would have detrimental effect on consumers but also could
"enable a few giant companies (or perhaps even individuals) to
dominate what is rapidly becoming the central factor of American
life -- the control of the dissemination of information in its many
forms."  "Evils of monopoly would be magnified by domination of the
key information industry by one or a few corporations," he said. 
However, he added:  "These problems are now for the Congress and
for another day."  He said he "gladly relinquishes the
responsibility [he] has exercised for the past 15 years over the
telephone segment of the provision of information in the United
States."  He said any parties with motions before court had 20 days
to file papers on whether relief sought in those motions still
could be granted as result of new law.

     Telecom Act will return nation to days when consumer had same

     Telecom Act will return nation to days when consumer had same
carrier for local and long distance service, only difference being
that they now will have choice as to who that provider is, said
panelists at Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS)
roundtable last week.  They said more deals like one recently
floated by AT&T and MCI can be expected because "everybody is
talking to everybody else."  AT&T Vp Michael Brown said
re-integration of local and long distance providers is
"inevitable," and long distance companies will have some advantages
such as experience in competitive and international markets, and
high name recognition.  However, he said, RHCs also have facilities
and high name recognition in their markets, and can control resale
prices.  Former FCC Chmn. Richard Wiley noted that RHCs have state
and local competition checklists to pass before they can move
forward, while long distance companies have no such requirement. 
Nynex Vp Jeff Ward said there will be 3-4 facilities-based carriers
per major market plus various value-added service providers.  LCI
International CEO Brian Thompson said RHCs may be challenged if
they seek to enter long distance markets via existing cellular
operations without meeting effective-competition standards.  He
also said that for competition to flourish, facilities of local
providers should be made available to resellers on reasonable
terms.  Ward said his company is positioning itself to be
"carriers' carrier" in approaching new telecom environment. 
Viacom's Ellen Schned said new law will have positive impact on
program distribution business because it will increase number of
distributors.  Without programming, she said, "a wire is just a
wire" and inclusion of more players like telcos will mean "more
eyeballs" that can see company's programs.

     MCI and AT&T have opened talks on possible joint business

     MCI and AT&T have opened talks on possible joint business
ventures, especially building local phone networks but possibly
covering other activities.  MCI cited AT&T's breakup into separate
service and equipment units and new Telecom Act of 1996 as
catalysts for talks between No. 1 and No. 2 IXCs.  MCI officials
were reluctant to offer details on discussions and AT&T declined to
comment on speculation.  "We're going to discuss a lot of things
with a lot of people," MCI official said.  Officials hinted talks
might take weeks or months to reach satisfactory conclusion for
either company.  MCI challenge to AT&T's monopoly in April 1974 led
to Bell System divestiture.  MCI said discussions, in earliest
stages, could include equipment purchases from new Lucent
Technologies company being formed from AT&T's old Network Systems
unit.  MCI-AT&T linkup also could be strategy to force RHCs to
offer improved discounts on resale rates, said William Giak,
national product dir., telecom and electric service, Deloitte &
Touche consulting.  "These [AT&T-MCI] negotiations would add a
dimension of pressure" in talks with RHCs, he said.

     U.S. Supreme Court decision on indecency on cable access

     U.S. Supreme Court decision on indecency on cable access
channels could have significant impact on legality of Telecom Act
provision allowing on-line service providers to limit indecency on
their services, Alliance for Community Media (ACM) said.  Oral
argument on case is set for Feb. 21.  Court decision, due in June,
is expected to hinge on whether federal rules allowing, rather than
requiring, private companies to limit indecency constitute "state
action" subject to strict First Amendment scrutiny.  In cable case,
ACM argued that such provisions actively encouraged private
companies to limit speech, so rules faced tough First Amendment
limits.  If court agrees, ACM Exec. Dir. Barry Forbes said, same
argument may be applied to on-line indecency provision.  "Anyone
who cares about the fundamental American right to free speech
should be watching closely the outcome of Alliance vs. FCC," Forbes
said.

     U S West is claiming 30% market share for its TeleChoice cable

     U S West is claiming 30% market share for its TeleChoice cable
testbed in Omaha after only 4 months, it said in quarterly
financial report.  RHC said it isn't claiming 30% penetration of
all 42,000 households in Western Omaha passed by interactive
testbed, only 30% of all households in area that buy any type of
cable services.  However, incumbent cable operator Cox said it has
had no significant net loss in number of subscribers since U S West
launch.  "We are very delighted in our performance in protecting
our market share," said Michael Kohler, community & govt. relations
mgr. for Cox system.  He acknowledged that system lost "some"
customers to U S West, but said they have largely been replaced by
new subscribers.  Competition has meant "all-time-high" cable
penetration in competitive area, Kohler said, but "I'm not sure
that it has grown enough to support everyone's claims."  Cox
spokeswoman said subscribership in Omaha increased 4% in 1995,
about same level as MSO-wide.  U S West has undercut Cox prices
somewhat, Kohler said, but Cox claims that with its free
line-maintenance plan, prices and program packages are "very
comparable."  Another cable operator overbuilt by U S West, Douglas
County Cablevision, has cut prices somewhat, and each of operators
is offering package discounts, but overall rates in Omaha area
haven't fallen significantly as result of testbed, Kohler said.

     Local implementation of Telecom Act of 1996 will produce
challenges to state commissions -- many of which are spread thin to
meet existing demands, said Lee Palagyi of National Assn. of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) in interview with Telecom
Monitor.  She's NARUC staff representative on congressional issues
and Ohio PUC aid to Comr. Jolynn Butler.  Key challenges will be: 
Meeting federal deadlines for interconnection;  assessing universal
service requirements;  drafting rules that seamlessly link with FCC
rules.  "It's difficult for states to get an accurate view on this
yet," she said.  "On the whole I'd say the states are prepared"
although small commissions and states not on path to competition
may be "overwhelmed" by new policy making, she said.  States such
as Cal., N.Y. and Ohio will be models, Palagyi said, but even those
may be "inundated" by flood of company filings.

     Wyo. PSC rejected AT&T bid to reconsider its approval of new
U S West (USW) pricing plan that would raise local rates and cut
in-state long distance, saying petition "restated, repeated and
rehashed" arguments made at public hearings.  New rates took effect
Feb. 15.  Commission earlier approved plan that raises most local
charges and lowers long distance average of 16% over 2 years to end
subsidy that covered some local costs.  AT&T said it was "extremely
disappointed" by denial, which it said allows USW to cut toll
services to level that "undisputedly fails" to include 80% of costs
of providing services, resulting in below-cost rate that it said
will hurt competitors.  Effect of pricing is to boost USW revenue
by $5.46 million, AT&T said.  It said PSC action "struck a
devastating blow to the development of competition" and would
"severely hamper" prospects for local competition.  Commission
lawyer David Lucero said AT&T didn't provide new information to
trigger reconsideration.  "AT&T used the appeal process to restate
a case it could not support with facts during the proceeding," said
Emily Harrison, USW spokeswoman in Casper.  USW set new flat rate
for residential service at $16.25 per month, compared with $12.64
monthly in rural areas and $14.64 monthly in towns with more than
24,300 lines, she said.  AT&T in petition said PSC had failed to
act on eliminating charges for carrier common lines that
competitors must buy from USW to provide toll service in state.

MCImetro sought interconnection agreement in Cleveland, asking
Ameritech to defer economic terms of agreement to PUCO for
resolution.  MCImetro plans to install switch for local traffic by
April and offer service later this year.  "What makes Ameritech's
nonaction so galling is that it has already done in Wisconsin what
we are asking it to do here in Ohio," she said.

DELAY IN CIRCULATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT SUE TO DOLE.TEXT

      It appears that the House Republican leadership has delayed
circulation of the telecommunications conference report because of
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole's (R-Kan.) concerns.  Dole has
cited problems with a provision that he perceives as a multi-billion
dollar spectrum giveaway.  However, sources close to the negotiations
speculated last week that Dole's real concern may lie with the
conference committee's decision to strike language abolishing
rate-of-return regulation.
     SBC Communications Inc., which serves Dole's home state of
Kansas, particularly is concerned about striking that language, the
sources said, and could be the real reason for the delay.
     A spokesman for SBC denied the charge.  An alternate form of
price regulation is already in place in Kansas.
     John Schneidawind, a spokesman for the Alliance for Competitive
Communications (ACC), which represents the seven regional holding
companies (RHCs), called the allegations "bunk."
     Larry Clinton, associate vice president of government relations
for the U.S. Telephone Association (USTA), said that he was "99
percent confident that the Bells are together.  Do they want greater
pricing flexibility?  Sure.  Do they want to hold the bill up over
this?  I don't think so," he said.  

  ...Dole's Concerns

     But a Dec. 7 letter that Dole sent to House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.) warning that any progress made on telecom legislation could be
"compromised" if telecom conferees "continue to consider regulatory
solutions that are clearly outside the scope of either bill" (WTN,
12/11/95,), seems to provide evidence that the majority leader is
harboring some serious concerns not associated with the spectrum
flexibility provisions. 
     "Whether it is moving backwards on regulation of phone rates,
expanding the House provision on facilities-based competition, or
weakening my forbearance provisions to get useless regulations, it is
all counter productive," Dole wrote.  
     A Dole spokesman said he could not comment beyond what the
majority leader said during a recent press conference, that, "there
are three, four, or five provisions including spectrum giveaway" that
are still of concern. 
     Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking member of the House Commerce
Committee, told sister publication Communications Today that there are
"honest problems [with the conference report] that are more political
than substantive."  He said many members are "unhappy" with the
report.  However, he was unsure how many members were involved, how
unhappy they were, and whether they were unhappy enough not to sign a
conference report.

  ...How Can Spectrum Flexibility Be Resolved?

     The budget reconciliation agreement currently being negotiated on
Capitol Hill will be Dole's recourse to resolve the spectrum
flexibility issue, sources said.  A plan put forward by President
Clinton to speed up the transition to digital TV has been shot down by
budget negotiators, but Dole may try and push to auction off the
spectrum.  Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-S.D.)
floated a similar plan in the early stages of the budget
reconciliation process, but it received a hostile reception by the
broadcasters and was killed.       
     Neither speeding up the transition to digital TV nor auctioning
off the additional 6 MHz needed for the transition would be
acceptable, sources said.  By auctioning off the spectrum, Congress in
essence would be making a public policy decision that it did not want
digital TV, the sources added. 
     The budget reconciliation issue will need to be resolved before
the telecommunications conference agreement is brought to the floor,
several Hill sources said.  Also, until Dole's concerns are resolved,
the House leadership refuses to circulate the conference report for
signature.

SHUTDOWN CONTINUES TO DELAY FCC ACTIONS, BUT AUCTIONS CONTINUE

     The planned Jan. 18 FCC meeting is "imperilled if we do not go
back to work soon," FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told sister publication
Communications Today last week.  The first day the FCC is open after
the current federal budget impasse ends, Hundt plans to meet with the
other commissioners to see if there are issues they can agree to
address on that date or soon after.
     It usually takes three weeks to put a commission meeting
together, but commissioners could agree that there is something they
want to accomplish and schedule a meeting more quickly upon their
return, Hundt said. 
     Asked what FCC work is being delayed by the shutdown, Hundt noted
that not only are "thousands of complaints, petitions, and
applications...not being filed," many proceedings are not being
addressed.  Although actions opening proceedings on access charge
reform and advanced TV policies have been discussed as possible agenda
items for the Jan. 18 meeting, Hundt said that he does not set the
agenda items until three weeks before the meeting. 

  ...Shutdown Affects Workgroup Participation

     Michele Farquhar, chief of the Wireless Telecommunications
Bureau, who made a brief appearance with Hundt at last week's Hearing
Aid Compatibility and Access to Digital Wireless Telecommunications
Summit, said that neither she nor other FCC officials could
participate in the summit's workgroups because of the government
shutdown.  The only thing Farquhar has received is emergency federal
worker status to continue overseeing FCC auctions.  
     All three ongoing commission auctions started up again last week
after a holiday hiatus.  These include the C-block personal
communications service auctions and the smaller specialized mobile
radio service and multipoint distribution service auctions.
     But the shutdown still burdens many segments of the wireless
industry awaiting actions in non-auction matters.  Farquhar said that
the bureau typically receives 3,000 license applications a day.  These
applications cannot be filed because of the shutdown.  Hundt said that
the upcoming Jan. 24 auctions of two direct broadcast satellite
construction permits will not be affected by the shutdown.  He noted
that Congress and the administration realize it would be "unacceptably
foolish" when the impasse is over the budget deficit to keep the
agency from bringing in money to reduce that deficit.

HUNDT:  INDUSTRY SHOULD SOLVE HEARING AID PROBLEMS

     FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told a wireless industry and consumer
gathering last week that the commission does not plan to mandate
hearing-aid compatibility standards for the wireless telecom industry. 
But he indicated that the agency stands ready to bite down with its
regulatory "teeth" if the digital wireless communications industry
does not try to provide access to America's 28 million
hearing-impaired consumers.  Pulse tones created by some digital
wireless technologies are claimed to interfere with hearings devices
used by many people.
     Opening the two-day Hearing Aid Compatibility and Accessibility
to Digital Wireless Telecommunications Summit, Hundt expressed regret
that FCC staff could not participate because of the government
shutdown.  The summit--organized by the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association (CTIA), the Personal Communications Industry
Association (PCIA), the PCS 1900 Group, and consumer and manufacturing
interests--is bringing industry and consumer interests together to
discuss interference and compatibility problems for hearing-aid users
in the rapidly changing world of wireless technology. 

 ...Encouraging Compromises and Practical Solutions

     Hundt encouraged summit participants to find compromises and
practical solutions.  He noted that wireless industry leaders have
assured the FCC that they will work with hearing-impaired consumers to
address their concerns.  With many new wireless technologies coming to
market, the possibility of compatibility problems will continue to
arise, he noted.  
     Hundt also emphasized the need for the cooperative processes
created at the summit to continue.  These include "identifying
compatibility problems as soon as they are spotted" and "trying to
understand the technology and the problems" rather than engaging in
wars of rhetoric.
     He assured industry that the FCC is "not going to mandate
solutions" and "lock in the status quo."  But "we are not going to say
that the marketplace will resolve all compatibility problems."
     CTIA President and CEO Thomas Wheeler said that the Oklahoma
University Center for the Study of Electromagnetic Compatibility,
which CTIA helped organize, should release on Jan. 15 the first round
of human factor results from its research to quantify interference
problems and isolate their causes.  CTIA also is using American
Personal Communication's digital system to test "bystander
interference"--the ability of a digital wireless phone to affect the
hearing aid of a nearby person not using that phone.  The completion
of this project is now projected for Feb. 15.
     Wheeler noted that the CDMA Development Group last month
announced a technical standard that provides a hearing-aid wearer with
the capability to turn off the component of CDMA (code division
multiple access) technology claimed to be a source of interference. 
"We are confident that the work of the EMC Center, which includes all
digital technologies: CDMA, PCS-1900 [the American version of the
European global systems for mobile communications standard], TDMA
[time-division multiple access], and IDEN [integrated dispatch
enhanced network]--will be able to identify other such solutions for
use with all technologies," he said.   

  ...A Running Start Toward Accessible Communications Technology

     The American Academy of Audiologists expressed hope that "the
summit meeting will provide a `running start' toward making 21st
century communications technology accessible to all citizens.  The
meeting also will help to clarify the parameters for appropriate
regulation of wireless communications by the FCC."  
     PCIA President Jay Kitchen praised the summit for bringing the
various interests "together to work in concert in a proactive, open,
and cooperative fashion with all the right technical expertise and a
results-oriented process in place."

C-BLOCK AUCTION TOTAL PASSES $1.2 BILLION

     Bidders in the C-block auction rocketed the net bid total to
$1.21 billion in the first four rounds before bidding closed Dec. 21
for the holidays.  The bidding competition at this early stage has
been fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13
rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the
$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses was
scheduled to resume at our deadline.
     According to sister publication PCS Week, the top markets have
been the scene of the most furious activity.  For example, Washington,
D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed a first round high bid of $11.3 million
for the Chicago basic trading area (BTA), only to have the lead taken
by GWI PCS Inc. in round two for $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. then
upped the ante to $61.4 million in round three.  Round four saw DCR
take another shot at the lucrative Chicago license with a bid of $70.3
million, or $8.59 per potential subscriber in the market.  Several
other markets, such as Miami and New York, have seen similar activity.
     High bids for round four included $203 million for New York by
PCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million for
Philadelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc.; $48.75 million
for San Francisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license by
PCS 2000.

  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction

     In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchers
and participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. 
"It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are so
many changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst at
Malarkey-Taylor Associates/Economic and Management Consultants
International Inc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at the
end of [the auction, the environment] looks different than when it
started."
     Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst for
Washington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was not
reading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I think
there's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lot
greater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent that
companies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auction
environment and that there are many bidders that are not quite as
sophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."
     Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top markets
may cause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. 
Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined not
to come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,
thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some of
these companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said. 

  ...What Is PCS 2000?

     Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has been
the aggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-based
partnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry ever
since it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of round
four, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442
million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000
had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of the
Eastern United States.  
     PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partners
developed and managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and
25 percent owner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that was
incorporated for [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four years
ago," said Javier Lamoso, company president.
     According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limited
partnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investment
companies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[The
investors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS
2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners owns
more than 3 percent of the company.
     Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he did
not want to signal the partnership's true motives to other players. 
He explained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS
2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets it
wants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "If
I tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,
I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCC
has interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want to
avoid any hint of implied collusion."

TELECOM BILL RATED ONE OF TOP SWEETHEART DEALS IN 1995

     The Center for Responsive Politics rated the telecommunications
reform effort as one of the 54 "special deals" where campaign
contributors succeeded in lobbying legislation on Capitol Hill.  In
Cashing In From A To Z, authors Nancy Watzman and James Youngclaus
cite the telecommunications bill as mostly an "inside deal" that was
fought out by industry players such as the large long-distance
carriers and the regional holding companies.  "The tone was set early
in the session when Republican members of the House Commerce Committee
held a series of private dinners with CEOs of major communications
companies," the report said.  
     The report also noted that the telecommunications industry poured
$2.7 million into the campaign coffers of House and Senate members
during the first half of this year.  Republicans received 75 percent
of that amount, according to the report.  Sen. Larry Pressler
(R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, received the most
money from the telecommunications industry:  $103,165 in Political
Action Committee (PAC) funds in the first six months of 1995.   Sen.
Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) received $37,000 in PAC funds.  
     On the House side, House Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R-Texas) received $97,000 in PAC
money from January through June of this year, according to the report.

AGENTS FIND SCANNER/EAVESDROPPER DISGUISED AS A CELLULAR PHONE

     A new threat to the mobile phone industry was uncovered in a
recent fraud bust.  Law enforcement agents found a scanner the size of
a business card portfolio used to capture electronic serial numbers
(ESNs) and mobile identification numbers (MINs).  When open, the
scanner measures approximately 11 inches high, 6 inches wide and 1.5
inches thick, said U.S. Secret Service spokesman William Whiteside.
     "Like the cellular side, the criminal side of the industry is
becoming more mobile and building smaller devices to facilitate their
criminal activities," said Tom McClure, Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association director-fraud management.
     Also uncovered in the bust was a device called a "Celltracker,"
which is perhaps more threatening than the pocket-size scanner.  This
device looks like a cellular phone, but can be used to eavesdrop on
other cellular phone conversations.  The device can capture ESNs/MINs
and functions as a "Lifetime" phone.  The Lifetime phone can store 99
ESNs/MINs, making it easy to avoid detection as a cloned phone.  Other
Lifetime phones without the scanner were confiscated in the bust as
well.  Their keypads are used to program ESNs/MINs.
     AT&T Wireless Services Inc. first notified law enforcement agents
after discovering an advertisement for the sale of illegal electronic
devices on the Internet.  For the first time, investigators used the
Internet to "wiretap" and monitor outgoing and incoming messages of
the crime ring's leaders, Bernhard Bowitz, his estranged wife, Rachel
Bowitz and Gregory Brooks.
     Some good news:  "We have come up with a solution," said McClure,
referring to authentication technology.  He said there are a
half-million authentication-capable handsets and tests are under way
in New York on authentication networks.
     While the authentication technology may prevent cloning fraud, it
does not eliminate the eavesdropping capability of the Celltracker. 
However, Cycomm Corp. introduced a service last week that could
prevent such criminal activity.  The PrivaCall Network service allows
customers in the United States or Canada to have calls scrambled to
prevent monitoring of their cellular calls.

  ...Extension Cloning Case Goes to Trial

     In a related item, the first fraud trial involving a man charged
with extension phone cloning is underway in Lexington, Ky.  Don Billy
Yates used equipment to program cellular phones with the same ESN/MIN
combinations, allowing his customers to have two phones for the price
of one.  For one time fee of $150 paid to Yates, customers would avoid
paying activation and monthly service charges for the second phone.
     In a motion to dismiss, Yates argued that federal law did not
prohibit his activities.  The judge disagreed, saying that Yates
defrauded cellular carriers by denying them the monthly service and
activation fees.
     "[The case] could be the most important [fraud] case the industry
has ever had," said CTIA's McClure.  "We have long advocated that
[extension cloning] is a violation."  A decision from the jury was
expected as we went to press.

IN CASE YOU MISED IT:

     * Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) decided to forgo a run for one
of Louisiana's Senate seats and will run for his 10th term in the
House.  According to the Associated Press, Tauzin--who recently
switched parties--said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has vowed
to name him chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee after the 1996 elections.  The subcommittee's current
chairman, Rep. Jack Fields (R-Texas), announced last month (WTN,
12/18/95,) that he is retiring to spend more time with his family. 
The subcommittee's vice chairman, Rep. Mike Oxley (R-Ohio), is next in
line for the job.  However, Oxley also chairs the Commerce, Trade and
Hazardous Waste Subcommittee.  

     * Seeking to provide multiLATA (local access and transport area)
personal communications service (PCS) in North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee, BellSouth Corp. has requested a waiver of the
1982 AT&T antitrust consent decree.  In addition, BellSouth asked the
U.S. district court overseeing the decree to relieve it of equal
access obligations for PCS in this area.     BellSouth noted that AT&T
Wireless, currently the only other PCS licensee in the region, is
likely to offer PCS on an integrated (local and long-distance
service), non-equal access basis.  "That being the case, granting the
waiver would be pro-competitive," it said.

     * Robert Woods, commissioner of the General Services
Administration (GSA), will discuss the Post-FTS 2000 program Jan. 16
in McLean, Va., at an event sponsored by Capitol Telecommunications
Professionals (CTP).  The Post-FTS 2000 program is designed to provide
government agencies with flexible, responsive, and state-of-the-art
voice, data and video networks; a Request for Proposal will be issued
in the next few months.  (CTP, 301/564-1032.)

     * Labeling the request an "extraordinary exercise in chutzpah,"
AT&T opposed Bell Atlantic Corp. and Ameritech Corp.'s joint motion
for court action allowing their minority-owned affiliate Telecom Corp.
of New Zealand (TCNZ) to provide "full circuit" service on calls
between the United States and New Zealand.  The two companies last
month asked the decree court to modify the 1990 order that allowed
them to invest in TCNZ. They want permission to provide the United
States half of the call to a point terminating on the U.S. West Coast. 
AT&T said TCNZ imposes the high accounting rates that the two regional
holding companies claim have disadvantaged them against competitors.
     "The effect of the proposed modification would be to enable
TCNZ-Bell Atlantic-Ameritech to impose even greater costs on U.S.
carriers and illicitly to advantage TCNZ's own full-circuit service,"
AT&T said.  Bell Atlantic and Ameritech also have not shown that "they
have lost the ability and incentive to leverage exchange monopolies
into long-distance markets in the five years since the TCNZ waiver
order was entered."

     * AT&T has opposed four regional holding companies' (RHCs') "me
too" requests for extensions of any decree waiver granted to an
individual RHC.  AT&T said that some of the waiver orders the RHCs
seek to extend "were granted solely because of facts unique to the
single [RHC which] sought and obtained the order."  AT&T specifically
noted a Pacific Telesis Group [PAC] waiver that allowed it to acquire
a 10 percent interest in a trans-Pacific cable.  
     The waiver would not have been granted, AT&T contended, if the
proposal was to allow each of the seven RHCs to acquire separate 10
percent interests, such that together they would own a 70 percent
stake in the cable.  "Yet this motion would authorize precisely that,"
AT&T said.       

     * The American Mobile Telecommunications Association plans to
hold a series of seminars on how independent specialized mobile radio
(SMR) operators can develop winning strategies in the new 800 MHz
regulatory framework.  The association also plans to form a panel of
experts that will help resolve any disputes arising from relocation. 
(AMTA, 202/331-7773.)

     * The Alarm Industry Communications Committee (AICC) has asked
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to overturn Judge
Harold Greene's decision denying AICC's motion to intervene in
Ameritech Corp.'s [AIT] request for an expedited waiver (case no.
95-5439) to acquire an alarm services company within Ameritech's
region.  The court granted the waiver 
Sept. 8.

1996 SEEN AS THE CALM BEFORE THE COMPETITIVE STORM

     The outlook for the telecommunications industry in 1996 is 
one of uncertainty and caution.  Many executives, regulators and
legislators believe 1996 will be the year companies across all lines
of the telecommunications industry jockey for position to prepare for
a marketplace without competitive barriers.
     Uncertainty lingers, of course, because the fate of the telecom
reform bill still is uncertain.  If the bill passes, consumers are not
likely to see immediate changes.  Instead, players in all facets of
the industry are likely to take a deep breath to figure out the
consequences of the legislation before making any major moves. 
     In other words, 1996 will be the calm before the storm.  Bernard
Ebbers, CEO of interexchange carrier (IXC) WorldCom Inc., said the
state of competition in the telecommunications marketplace will change
very little in 1996.  Some changes may be noticed by the end of this
year, he said, but dramatic changes will not occur until 1997.
     "I think the legislation is irrelevant in 1996," Ebbers said. 
"If legislation is passed I think we'll see very little effect in
1996.  People will be getting ready, but I don't think we'll see much
of a roll out of anything this year."
     Roy Neel, president and CEO of the U.S. Telephone Association
(USTA),   said nothing will happen overnight once the legislation is
approved.  In some cases, the industry will have to look at how the
FCC implements the legislation.
     "You may get the bill passed tomorrow, but it may take six months
to write the rules to implement it," Neel said.

  ...Merger Mania?

     Some believe the landscape will become less crowded as companies
across all lines of the telecommunications industry begin merging and
allying.  The industry has been moving in that direction over the last
two years, with companies partnering to do everything from developing
interactive TV services to offering personal communications services
(PCS).   
     Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), a member of the House Commerce
Committee and its Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, said
the pace of consolidation will accelerate once a bill is passed. 
Boucher believes the industry could start to see national multimedia
companies develop this year that will provide a host of offerings such
as television and movie production and cable TV and telephone
services.
     "I think that will eventually occur as the lines that distinguish
telephone, cable and entertainment companies blur, and in the future,
vanish altogether," he said.  
     Pacific Telesis Group Vice President for Corporate Strategy Bob
Barada thinks legislation will force the telecommunications industry
down the same path as other large industries where only three or four
major players exist in a given market. 
     "That's probably going to happen in our industry when legislation
gets out of the way," said Barada.  "I don't think [the marketplace]
can sustain eight huge local exchange companies and four huge IXCs."  
     Others, however, do not subscribe to the shakeout theory that
Barada and others are espousing.  USTA's Neel said that predictions
that only a few companies will be left after the smoke clears are
"certainly premature and perhaps even nonsense."
     Two candidates often mentioned as merger partners are Bell
Atlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp..  The two already are members of the
Tele-TV venture, were members of a consortium that bid in the PCS
auctions, and have merged their cellular operations.  
     George Schmidt, who now is president of Omnipoint Communications
Inc., worked with both companies when he was president and CEO of PCS
PrimeCo, the PCS alliance that also includes U S WEST Communications
[USW] and AirTouch Communications [ATI].  While NYNEX and Bell
Atlantic are a good fit geographically, they operate very differently
and their  respective chairmen--Ivan Seidenberg and Ray Smith--"make
strange bedfellows," Schmidt said, adding, "I don't know if Ivan, who
just became chairman of NYNEX, could stand being anything less than
that.  We know Ray can't, and he's not retiring."
     Another takeover candidate mentioned by many is MFS
Communications Co. Inc..  The competitive access provider's president,
Royce Holland, thinks such speculation is due to the fact that his
company is well positioned to take advantage of deregulation.  MFS, he
said, serves more office square footage with fiber than any other
company in the world.
     "We're not necessarily looking for alliances," Holland said. 
"[But] if something comes along that makes sense we'll take a hard
look at it."

  ...The Wireline Wars

     Regardless of whether the legislation passes, consumers in
several states will see competition in the local telephone market. 
Legislators and regulators in states like California and New York
already have cleared the way for competition in the local loop.   
     "We believe that 1996, especially in California, is the year of
the wireline wars," PacTel's Barada noted. 
     MFS's Holland said if 1995 was the year of co-carrier rules, 1996
will be the year of co-carrier implementation.  Holland's company has
either applied to or has been approved to provide local telephone
service in 17 states.
     "I think 1996 will see a big acceleration in competition in the
local loop," Holland said.  "We certainly saw a lot happen in '95 on
the state level...I think we'll see a lot of these regulatory
breakthroughs implemented."
     As competition heats up, the industry and regulators still will
struggle with issues such as interconnection and access policies, the
correct approach to universal service, protections for service quality
and number portability, said Lisa Rosenblum, deputy chairwoman of the
New York Public Service Commission.
     "Even if you get the basic policy established, there's a range of
areas that you're going to have to continue to monitor or modulate,"
Rosenblum said. 

  ...Local Telcos Under Assault

     As the local loop opens in states across the country, the
companies which have had a monopoly over local service will be thrust
into a competitive environment, in particular facing the aggressive
marketing and advertising of the three major long-distance carriers: 
AT&T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp..  
     To prepare for the onslaught, the seven regional holding
companies (RHCs), GTE Corp., and the nation's more than 1,000 other
local exchange carriers (LECs) need to be just as aggressive on the
marketing front as their soon-to-be competitors.  USTA's Neel said the
LECs need to capitalize on the fact that consumers give local
telephone companies high ratings for providing dependable, reliable
and high quality service.  To avoid the churn that is so prevalent in
the long-distance industry, the LECs need to hammer this point into
consumers' heads.
     "The key for LECs is to become more aggressive tooters of their
own horn, so to speak," Neel said.
     PacTel's Barada said the RHCs must move from being considered
order takers to being known as aggressive marketers.  The companies
also must show the business and residential markets that they are
serious about providing superior service.  Consumers, he said, will
find out this year that their local telephone companies are ready,
willing and able to serve their needs.
     "Starting in '96 you're going to see us really trying to find
what holds consumers together, and willing to pat their backs and give
them massages," he said.

STOCKS:  DESPITE DECEMBER's DOWNDRAFT, IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR

     A tumultuous year but one that, in the end, proved highly
rewarding from a financial standpoint --that is how many who follow
the wireless industry from Wall Street doubtless will remember 1995.  
     For the 12 months through Dec. 29, the North American
Telecommunications Index--composed of the stocks of 16 publicly held,
large-capitalization companies, all of which do business in cellular
and paging services or in manufacturing wireless equip-ment (WB&F,
Jan. 4, 1995)--increased 30.4 percent. Much of this gain came in the
second half of 1995.     Not all telecom indices followed this
pattern, however.  The 20-stock Chicago Board Options Ex-change Global
Telecommunications Index, up 22.5 percent on the year, was flat since
mid-July.

AUSTRIAN GSM LICENSE AWARDED FOR $400 MILLION

     Bowing to bidders' demands that a winner be named by year's end,
Austria's top telecom regulator announced Dec. 29 that a German-led
group will be licensed to operate the nation's first private cellular
system.  O-Call, led by Deutsche Telekom and Siemens AG with financial
backing from Austrian interests, is to begin service of the global
system for mobile communications (GSM) network in about six months. 
Austria's PTT, building out its own GSM service, is expected to pay
the same amount--$400 million--that Transportation Commissioner Viktor
Klima said O-Call offered for the 15-year license.

LATE-1995 SIGNPOSTS POINT WAY TOWARD INDUSTRY TRENDS OF 1996

Executive Summary:  From interviews with industry leaders and analysis
of recent events, it is possible to connect some of the dots and make
educated guesses about what 1996 holds in store for wireless.

     The way Larry Vanston sees it, the year ahead "will be a lot like
'95" in the world of wireless telecommunications.  This is to say that
1996 will be another year of record-setting growth, heightened
competition and rapid techno-logical change for the industry,
according to Vanston, president of Austin, Texas-based consultants
Technology Futures Inc.
     Vanston and other observers surveyed by WB&F said it may well be
that the industry is in for a year when the pace of developments, if
anything, gains more momentum.  Such an acceleration is seen occurring
across a broad front--mani-fested by prices for services driven lower
as more competitors arrive on the scene and by a stream of
technological advances--and against a backdrop where wireless
telephony becomes a widespread reality in more markets overseas.
     But this is not to say that there are no clouds on the wireless
horizon.  Indeed, renewed signs of a slowdown in the U.S. cellular
market--the world's largest, in terms of absolute subscribers--have
dampened the growth outlook for network operators and for handset and
infrastructure manufacturers. 
     As Nokia Corp. noted Dec. 14, "Despite improvement in Nokia's
U.S. mobile phone business, growth and profitability in Nokia Mobile
Phones have developed somewhat below plan."  That sent the price of
Nokia's American Depositary Receipts tumbling for the second time in
two months (page 9).  
     However, it was unclear at press time whether handset
manufacturers in general faced a repeat of the overages that built up
in their U.S. inventories during the 1994 Christmas season.
     All the same, Wall Streeters are a notoriously fickle bunch, and
any fall-off in domestic wireless growth should be measured against
the blistering ex-pansion that the U.S. market enjoyed during 1994 and
the first half of 1995.  Net subscriber additions simply could not be
sustained forever at such an ex-plosive rate, and cellular's long-term
growth pattern seems firmly intact. 
     By the end of 1996, it is conceivable that there will be 40
million cellu-lar subscribers in the United States--a gain of 10
million in a 15-month span.

  ...All Eyes Turn to PCS

     Big changes are destined to sweep the U.S. wireless market this
year, as the industry comes to grips with the probable enactment of
legislation aimed at deregulating telecommunications.  This would give
network operators "the statu-tory certainty they need to move forward
with big purchases of new equipment," said Matthew Flanagan, president
of the Telecommunications Industry Association, Arlington, Va.
     Moreover, the U.S. market is on the verge of entering a new phase
with the advent of broadband personal communications services (PCS). 
It may be another year yet before PCS is marketed on a large scale,
but PCS licensees are betting big bucks that both lower price points
and the digitally enhanced sound quality of calls placed over their
systems will prove appealing to consumers who have disdained cellular
as too costly and to at least some cellular subscribers.    
     This year's challenges for PCS players will be to finish the U.S.
licensing process--the C-block spectrum auction (see page 10) is set
to resume this week--and to bring newly licensed services to market,
said Tom Mateer, vice president of business development for Sprint
Telecommunications Venture (STV), the al-liance of Sprint Corp. and
three large cable television operators.
     "Our goal is to provide service in our own markets by the end of
1996," Mateer said of Kansas City-based STV, the largest of the A/B-
block major trading area (MTA) licensees in terms of potential market
population.  Other MTA licensees, including AT&T Wireless Services and
PCS PrimeCo L.P., are working against similar timetables.
     While committed to code division multiple access (CDMA) as its
technology
standard, STV had not named equipment vendors for its network
buildout--estimated to cost from $3 billion to $4 billion by industry
sources--at press time.  Mateer said talks with prospective suppliers
were "moving along."
     Some funds from Sprint's long-anticipated deal to sell 10 percent
equity interests to France Telecom and Germany's  Deutsche Telekom,
which was approved by the FCC last month, are expected to be earmarked
for STV's buildout.
     On the narrowband side of PCS, action will center on how
successfully competitors narrow the lead that Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp. (Mtel) enjoys in this market.  For its part, Mtel
continues to grapple with what Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. recently called
"rollout concerns" surrounding the company's SkyTel 2-Way advanced
messaging service.  

  ...Competition, Consolidation and Convergence:  More of the Same,
Only More So

     Perhaps the most important issue before the wireless industry is
how to compete effectively on a landscape that seemingly keeps
shifting beneath its feet.  For many wireless players, achieving
"scale" is the way to maximize their competitive ability.  
     This consolidation trend has been most pronounced in paging,
where Arch Communications Group Inc. and AirTouch Paging announced the
most recent acquisitions, deals giving them about 2.5 million and 2.2
million U.S. subscribers, respectively.  Suf-fice it to say that more
paging acqui- sitions are in the offing this year.
     But 1996 will see the introduction of new wireless players as
well, via corporate spinoffs.  For instance,  Sprint's spinoff of its
Sprint Cellular subsidiary to shareholders (WB&F, June 21, 1995) is on
track for completion late next month or early in March, and AT&T
Corp.'s landmark breakup (WB&F, Sept. 27, 1995) is set to close by
year's end.
     Other wireless companies may become publicly held entities. 
PageMart Inc., the only privately held company among the top U.S.
paging operators, has hinted that it may go this route, and London
financial circles are abuzz that Hutchison Wampoa of Hong Kong will
float Orange, its U.K. personal communications network (PCN)--possibly
as part of a larger realignment of its telecom interests.
     And the cast of characters getting into wireless seems likely to
keep on growing.  Two recent examples: 

     *  A unit of International Family Entertainment Inc., whose
chairman is evangelist Pat Robertson, bought out the majority interest
held by Motorola Inc. in Pakistan Mobile Communications Ltd., licensed
to offer nationwide cellular service based on the global system for
mobile communications (GSM) standard as well as paging in the Asian
country.
     *  Fidelity Capital, part of the Boston-based mutual funds giant,
has helped engineer a deal aimed at strengthening specialized mobile
radio (SMR) operator Pittencrieff Communications Inc. in its core
Texas market (WB&F, May 10, 1995).  Pittencrieff shareholders were to
vote late this week on the company's merger with Fidelity-owned
Advanced MobileComm Inc.
     Meanwhile, convergence has continued to take on new and different
forms in wireless.  For instance, there is the growing trend among
competition-minded service providers to establish themselves as "one-
stop shops." 
     In the space of a week last month, Dallas-based Paging Network
Inc. (PageNet) announced marketing agreements with both STV and GTE
Corp., giving PageNet new distribution channels for its digital and
alphanumeric services in both the PCS and local telephone markets,
respectively.  
     STV, by packaging cable services on a promotional basis with its
planned service offerings for the local and long-distance telephone
markets, appears to be seeking as many distribution sources as
possible.  STV also signed an agree-ment covering various text-
messaging services with National Dispatch Center Inc., a San Diego-
based data network operator, last month. 

  ...Technology:  It's Show Time for CDMA, iDEN

     Technology, like competition, is a powerful catalyst for
convergence.  The wireless industry should look during 1996 for more
developments along the lines of these recent announcements:
     *  Putting aside their intense rivalry, Motorola granted L.M.
Ericsson AB a license to use Flex, Motorola's high-speed paging
protocol, in the Swedish company's pagers and infrastructure
equipment.
     *  IBM Corp., Nokia and the PCS subsidiary of Pacific Telesis
Group will work together on making wireless data services accessible
to subscribers via IBM ThinkPad laptop computers.  The ability to send
and receive e-mail and facsimile messages and to gain access to the
Internet will be a key selling point for Pacific Bell Mobile Services
in marketing PCS in its service area of California and Nevada, the
companies said.
     But in the dynamic field of wireless technology, the CDMA air
interface--and its promise of offering 10 times the capacity of analog
cel-lular--no doubt will command the limelight right through 1996.     
          The first CDMA system to achieve commercial status was
Hutchison Telecom's cellular service in Hong Kong last fall.  Next up
will be a long-awaited cellular network built out in Los Angeles by
AirTouch Com-munications, which has spent much time fine-tuning it,
followed by the
mid-1996 launch of Shinsegi Tele-communications Inc.'s cellular system
in South Korea (WB&F, Aug. 30, 1995).
     Importantly, the 43 member companies of the CDMA Development
Group have verified test results done with CDMA's 13 kilobits per
second vocoder, a touch-stone to achieving wireline-quality voice
communications over CDMA networks. 
     CDMA handsets for use on PCS networks are expected to become
available during the first half of 1996, said Kevin Kelley, vice
president of external affairs for Qualcomm Inc., San Diego.  The
company plans to ship 1 mil-lion terminals this year.
     For enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR) operator Nextel
Communica-tions Inc. [CALL], at least some of the questions
surrounding the sound quality of Motorola's ESMR technology, known as
iDEN (WB&F, April 12, 1995), will be resolved this year.  
     Even while cementing its nation-wide footprint in place with the
immi-nent completion of its acquisition of Dial Page Inc. [DPGE], the
Rutherford, N.J.-based company plans to conduct asingle-market beta
test of what Nextel executives call "reconfigured iDEN" before the end
of March.  Based on the re-sults, the company will decide whether to
proceed with a "more broad-scale com-mercial introduction" of the
technology, Nextel disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange
Commission filing.
     Meanwhile, Geotek Communications Inc.--with a $25 million line of
credit provided by Hughes Electronics Corp. at its disposal to acquire
additional 900 MHz spectrum--will begin commercial operation of its
own SMR service in Philadelphia, its initial market, this month.
     Finally, two companies developing interference-reducing cellular
filters that use high-temperature superconducting materials are bound
to make news.  Illinois Superconductor Corp. is proceeding with
operational field trials, while Superconductor Technologies Inc.
announced the delivery of its second receiver filter subsystem for GSM
base stations last week.

  ...International:  Asia, Brazil Seen as Where the Action Will Be

     According to the Commerce Department's Office of
Telecommunications, Brazil and India (WB&F, Dec. 6, 1995) will merit
close scrutiny from the wireless industry this year as emerging
markets with the greatest untapped potential.
     Also, noted agency analyst Stephanie McCullough, cellular
competition will come to five countries for the first time:  South
Korea, Taiwan, Belgium, Poland and Ireland.  The Czech Republic will
choose operators for two digital net-works this spring, and PCN
services may take shape in more European nations (page 7).
     Three other Asian "tigers" also are likely to make waves in
cellular in 1996.
     In China, handset prices and user tariffs are projected to fall,
spelling further rapid subscriber growth.  Having recently awarded
Ericsson its third infrastructure contract in 12 months, Guangdong
Mobile Communications Corp. soon will qualify as one of the world's
biggest network operators, boasting subscriber capacity of ap-
proximately 1.2 million on its GSM network and more than 1.4 million
on its analog system.
     In Indonesia, the state-run PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia is con-
verting its revenue-sharing arrangements with private investors in the
nation's five fixed and mobile operators into joint ventures.  This
may open the door to more foreign capital, akin to the $800 million
and the $586 million that Nynex Corp.WB&F, Oct. 11, 1995) and Deutsche
Telekom paid, respectively, for equity stakes in Indonesia's two GSM
carriers last year.
     In terms of sheer numbers of participants--seven, with a combined
sub-scriber base projected by Lehman Brothers Asia Ltd. at 1 million
as of the end of 1995--Malaysia is one of the most competitive of the
major markets for voice-based wireless services in the world.  Celcom-
-the nation's dominant cellular operator (WB&F, Dec. 7, 1994) but
saddled with an analog-based system--faces a difficult task in
protecting its market position against several upstarts offering
higher-capacity GSM.

INTERCEL PREPARES TO LAUNCH OFFERINGS OF STOCK, NOTES

     InterCel Inc. anticipates spending $110 million this year to
build out personal communication service (PCS) networks in major
trading areas for which Powertel PCS Partners L.P. won licenses last
year, followed by an ad-ditional commitment of $150 million to be
spent in 1997.
     In its latest annual report, West Point, 
Ga.-based InterCel disclosed that it plans to make concurrent public
offerings of stock and notes during the first quarter of 1996. 
Approximate amounts raised from these offerings will be $115.5 million
and $150 million, respectively.
     The offerings are being undertaken in conjunction with the
cellular network operator's plans to acquire Powertel (WB&F, July 5,
1995), a privately held con-sortium in which InterCel already is a
major participant.  
     Cash interest on the notes will not be payable before 2001. 
InterCel also is negotiating a $20 million revolving credit facility.
     While noting that its cellular operations have achieved "positive
operating income," InterCel warned in the annual report that

reflecting the impact of PCS buildout and marketing costs.

CELLULAR OPERATOR CLOSES TWO-TRACK DEBT FINANCING

     Colombia's Communicacion Celular SA (Comcel) received net
proceeds of $145.5 million from a recently completed debt financing,
the company's first.
     The funds will be used to expand the company's network coverage
in its eastern Colombia service area, which includes the capital city
of Bogota and which has a potential market population of 15.8 million
people.
     Comcel, adding subscribers at the rate of 4,000 a month, had a
mid-December base of approximately 62,000.  The company is in the
process of upgrading its technology, with the time division multiple
access digital standard to be paired with its advanced mobile phone
system analog network.
     The financing, said majority owner Bell Canada International
Inc., had two components:  a $100 million syndicated Eurodollar senior
secured term loan due in the year 2001; and an oversubscribed $150
million private placement of 
high-yield senior deferred coupon bonds due 2003.  The bonds, which
will accrete at a 13.125 percent rate compounded semiannually until
November 2000 and begin paying cash interest in May 2001, are combined
with warrants that, if fully ex-ercised, would amount to a 2 percent
equity interest in Comcel. 
     Montreal-based Bell Canada International, a BCE Inc. subsidiary,
owns 51 percent of Comcel.  The rest is owned by Colombia's principal
telecom companies, wireline operator Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de
Santafe de Bogota and long-distance carrier Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones.

LACK OF HANDSETS SEEN IMPEDING DUAL-BAND GSM SERVICES  

     Cellular operators that employ global system for mobile
communications (GSM) technology in their networks should think long
and hard about pairing their services with GSM's higher-frequency
counterparts, DCS-1800 and PCS-1900.
     So says Toni Stadelmann, deputy managing director of mobile
services for Swiss Telecom, which has deployed a DCS-1800 personal
communi-cations network (PCN) in Geneva to go with its nationwide GSM
cellular network.  
     While its experience with PCN has been limited
--the Geneva system was rolled out to coincide with the Telecom '95
trade show and conference last October--the PTT plans to introduce
DCS-1800 service in Zurich and Basel next fall as a capacity-enhancing
supplement to 900 MHz cel-lular in these high-traffic markets,
Stadelmann told the PCS-1900 in North America conference in Washington
last month.
     In the long run, he said, the company hopes to reach roaming
agreements that would tie its PCN service together with Europe's GSM
cellular operators and countries that either have PCN already--the
United Kingdom, Germany and France--or are contemplating PCN rollouts,
including Sweden and Italy.
     But there is one sizable problem:  Wireless equipment
manufacturers need to speed up efforts to bring dual-band mobile
phones to market.  The subject of GSM/DCS-1800 handsets also came up
during another recent meeting in Washington.      "I don't know of any
vendor today committed to" developing these handsets, Malcolm Cowan,
general manager of the Richardson, Texas-based PCS business unit of
Northern Telecom Ltd., told the PCS Strategies conference. 
     If recent contract announcements are any indication, however,
Finland's Nokia Corp. may be the first to take the plunge. 
     The company has signed a two-year contract with Telia Mobitel,
the biggest GSM cellular network in Sweden, for the delivery of base
station subsystems that can be used either for a stand-alone DCS-1800
network or a seamless dual-band service.  The base stations are
designed to bolster capacity in areas with heavy calling traffic as
well as to improve indoor coverage.  

  ...Savings on Fixed and Operating Costs, More Flexibility in Setting
Rates

     Nokia's other recent GSM/DCS-1800 infrastructure deals were with
NordicTel Holdings of Sweden and Sonofon of Denmark.  It also was the
vendor for Swiss Telecom's DCS-1800 system.
     For Swiss Telecom--scheduled to face competition in PCN beginning
in 1998, when spectrum set aside for private operators will be opened
up--pairing GSM and DCS-1800 will afford cost advantages in the areas
of infrastructure, its trans-mission network and customer service and
billing, Stadelmann said.  
     According to an analysis in which the PTT assigned different
weightings to these cost areas, potential savings of 30 percent can be
had--12 percent on both transmission network and billing/customer
service expenses and another 6 percent on infrastructure costs.
     Moreover, in limiting its PCN coverage to urban areas, Stadelmann
said that Swiss Telecom has found that it can devise a rate structure
that offers greater appeal to the more price-conscious segment of the
wire-less voice market.
     By setting rates close to those of the wireline network, Swiss
Telecom hopes to induce customers to switch over to PCN from the fixed
network for the mobility it affords.  But that, of course, first would
require a more robust roaming capability.
     All Stadelmann could do last month was ask rhetorically:  "What
are the manufacturers ... doing?"  He would like to see action sooner
rather than later.

GLENAYRE, NEXUS TEAM UP TO SUPPORT SPREAD-SPECTRUM TECHNOLOGY

     Glenayre Technologies Inc. is considering plans to manufacture
re-ceivers incorporating technology developed by Nexus
Telecommunication Systems Ltd., which plans to market the technology
to paging operators aiming to address the "low end" of the two-way
messaging market.
     The companies announced an agreement last month to collaborate on
inte-grating Glenayre-made switches, controllers and base stations
with Nexus's reverse-channel receivers and two-way applications
platform.  
     The deal is noteworthy because Glenayre will provide protocol
information on the company's GL3000 advanced paging terminal that
would facilitate the operation of the two-way Nexus Network on
existing one-way paging systems.  
     Besides possibly making Nexus-based receivers itself, Glenayre
holds an option to buy them from Nexus as an original equipment
manufacturer.  In return, Nexus granted the Charlotte, N.C.-based
company the right to obtain a worldwide license on its return-channel
technology.

  ...U.S. Beta Test Draws Near 

     Essentially, the spread-spectrum Nexus technology (WB&F, Nov. 9,
1994) af-fords one-way paging carriers a low-speed return channel. 
Nexus Network uses the unlicensed 902-928 MHz band for the return
channel, which operates at 200 bits per second--far slower than ReFlex
or pACT, the narrowband personal commun-ications service (PCS)
protocols developed by Motorola Inc. and AT&T Wireless Systems,
respectively.
     Rani Cohen, senior vice president of Givatayim, Israel-based
Nexus, said that Nexus Network is geared toward service offerings
where speed is not critical--most notably, a confirmation or short-
messaging capability that would appeal to price-sensitive paging
subscribers.
     A beta test of Nexus Network involving American Paging Inc. and
several other U.S. carriers is scheduled for next month.  
Minneapolis-based American Paging holds five regional narrowband PCS
licenses. 
     Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate, is expected to begin
shipping
two-way paging units supporting Nexus Network by next summer.

DICHOTOMY IN TELECOM STOCKS AS MARKET CLOSES OUT 1995

     Optimism over U.S. telecom deregulation helped provide ballast
for the stocks of some network operators, but many equipment-related
equities are still being held in check by uncertainty over profits.
  ... Glenayre gave shareholders a Christmas present in the form of a 3-
for-2 stock split--the equipment manufacturer's second such
distribution in six months.

MULTIPLE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS, AND MORE ON THE WAY

     At the FCC's Dec. 15 open meeting, Chairman Reed Hundt hailed the
prospect of simultaneous spectrum auctions as a "tremendous
accomplishment."  
     And with good reason.  While the specialized mobile radio (SMR)
auction that began a month ago generally has moved along at a more
sedate pace, the C-block auction of bandwidth for broadband personal
communications services (PCS) kicked off with a bang on Dec. 18:  Net
high bids for the 493 C-block licenses exceeded $1.2 billion by the
end of the fourth round.
     One hopeful, Puerto Rico-based PCS 2000 L.P., offered an
astronomical $327 million in net high bids for basic trading area
(BTA) licenses in the first round, skewing the bidding.  But the
hectic activity put to rest at least some doubts about whether the
long-delayed C-block auction would measure up to last year's PCS
auction of major trading area licenses.
     Meanwhile, SMR operators praised FCC plans to auction wide-area
licenses for 10 MHz in contiguous blocks of 20, 60 and 120 channels in
the 800 MHz band.  Also, two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs)
will allot still more spectrum for use in wireless applications if
adopted as final rules by the FCC:
     *  One would open the 37-38.6 GHz band for point-to-point
microwave operations.  BTA licenses would be auctioned off--possibly
as soon as a year from now--with credits and installment plans
accorded to small businesses that wish to bid.  A provision would
permit the processing of pending license applications in the 38.6-40
GHz band. 
     *  The other NPRM would give hospitals access to vacant
television channels in the very and ultra high-frequency bands,
doubling in many regions the number of frequencies available for
remote patient monitoring.  Higher power levels also would be allowed
for medical telemetry devices.
(FCC, Tel.: 202/632-7000.)

NEW YEAR BEGINS WITH CDPD CARRIERS STILL FACING SEVERAL TASKS BEFORE
ESTABLISHING NATIONAL SERVICE

     As of Jan. 1, cellular digital packet data (CDPD) service was
available in 31 of the top 50 U.S. cellular markets and a number of
smaller markets as well.  WDN's conservative estimate is that
commercial CDPD service is available to approximately 85 million
people--a third of the U.S. population.
     Those figures fall below the midyear aims of the leading CDPD
carriers, which hoped to have as many as 40 of the 50 top markets
covered by the end of 1995.  Plans are in place to establish service
in most of the remaining 19 markets with a few exceptions, most
notably Los Angeles.  Much of the coming year also will be devoted to
filling in coverage in the many markets where CDPD does not match full
cellular coverage.
     A great deal of work remains before CDPD becomes a true national
service.  After the continued buildout, interconnection between
cellular markets becomes an increasingly important priority.  In the
six months since the first interconnection agreement was signed by
Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet, only one other
agreement, between GTE and Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile (BANM), has been
signed.
     "The fundamental nature of the agreements is simple, but when you
get into all of the elements, it ends up being time consuming as you
get both sets of lawyers in motion," said Mike Franklin, BANM direc-
tor-product management for wireless data.  Even for cellular lawyers
accustomed to working out more complicated roaming agreements, CDPD
has been more difficult than expected.
     "I think billing has been an issue.  A lot of companies are still
choosing their billing systems.  At the same time that they are trying
to interoperate, they haven't even determined what they are going to
use to share information," said Ellen Smith, business development
manager-wireless data service for SNET Mobility.
     A thornier problem has been caused by the complexities of the
1984 consent decree managing the breakup of AT&T.  U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene's April 1995 order allowing the cellular subsidiaries of
Bell regional holding companies (RHCs) to provide limited long-
distance service included a clause designed to aid national CDPD
service.
       The ruling allows RHC subsidiaries to provide CDPD between
markets without having to provide alternative long-distance options to
the consumer.  Carriers can buy long-distance service at bulk rates,
greatly reducing the cost of operation.  At the same time, however,
the judge ordered the carriers to file "compliance plans" with the
Justice Department before providing long-distance packet data.
     Carriers also must prove that a competitive access provider (CAP)
is operating in a market before the Justice Department will approve
interconnections in that market.  That process, which must be done
market by market, has been one of the most time-consuming
complications.  The three-week partial shut-down of the federal
government, which included Justice Department employees, did not help
matters.
     "We have certified [through Justice] that there are CAPs
operating in Connecticut and the New York metro market, which includes
northern New Jersey," Franklin said.  The carrier has been waiting for
months for approval in other markets.
     BANM and Ameritech are affected directly by the situation, but
non-RHCs, such as GTE and AT&T Wireless Services are affected
indirectly by the inability to provide national service that some of
their customers demand.
     "We are very anxious to put the nationwide network in place.  We
are focusing on carriers that have major markets that are of interest
to our customers," said Jeff Damir, director-product marketing and
management for AT&T's wireless data division.  "Chicago [an Ameritech
market] has been an important market for some time due to the fact
that American Airlines is one of our most important customers."
     Under the two interconnection agreements now in operation, actual
commercial roaming is limited.  It is available between GTE's markets
and BANM's markets cleared by the Justice Department.  Ameritech,
which interprets the ruling somewhat differently, has opened its
markets to GTE customers, but Ameritech customers cannot roam to GTE
markets, an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  Ameritech hopes to have its
compliance report approved by next month.
     There is some progress in the interconnection discussions,
however, and carriers are piecing their commercial markets into the
beginnings of a national service.

     "Over the next six months, significant progress will be made with
interconnection agreements and the coverage that will be available to
AT&T customers," Damir said.
     The opening of new markets appears to be increasing.  Over the
last three months of 1995, BANM established CDPD service in its last
major market, Boston, and began opening the service in some of its
smaller markets that border major metropolitan areas, such as
Frederick, Md., and Hunterdon, N.J.
     AT&T recently began commercial service in Pittsburgh and
Ameritech in St. Louis.  Ameritech is nearing commercial openings in
its three Ohio markets (Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton) and
Milwaukee.  GTE expects to be operating in San Diego soon.
     SNET Mobility has established CDPD services to reach 70 percent
of the population of Connecticut with a solid stretch of service
reaching from New York City to Hartford.  Its next priority is to
establish interconnection with other carriers to provide its customers
with service stretching throughout the northeastern United States.
     Carriers' next priority after building and connecting networks
will be to do more to market the service.  "My Top 10 list [of
priorities] starts with, 'Get more customers on the network.'  Every
other objective is a subset of that," Franklin said.

1995 IS MARKED BY INCREMENTAL CHANGES; PREPARATION FOR
THE TIME WHEN WIRELESS DATA BECOMES POPULAR BUSINESS TOOL

     No single dramatic event or development sums up wireless data
development in 1995.  It was instead a year of slow changes in mobile
devices and software and steady rollout of new infrastructure.  It
left room for speculation of what might be, but a still unclear pic-
ture of how popular the technology ultimately will be.
     On the positive side, there appears to be greater confidence
among some packet data developers, including the Ardis packet radio
network (see page 8), that the potentially lucrative mobile
professional market may soon be within reach, as applications improve
and devices become more functional and lower priced.
     But there is a negative side as well.  National cellular digital
packet data (CDPD) service remains a project under construction and it
still may have considerable building left at the end of 1996.  Its
rival packet data carriers, Ardis and RAM Mobile Data, continue to
have a difficult time broadening their customer bases.
     The two packet radio networks combined served approximately
67,000 users at the beginning of 1995.  In spite of confident
predictions, packet data still is used by fewer than 100,000
customers.
     Perhaps the most dramatic developments in wireless data came from
the unlicensed system developers--wireless local area networks (LANs),
unlicensed personal communications services and, perhaps one day,
Apple Computer Inc.'s vision of a wireless "National Information
Infrastructure" (NII).
     Even if wide-area licensed data approaches never grow into a
market of millions, the promise of unlicensed systems ensures that a
considerable amount of data will travel over airwaves in the future.
     Following is a summary of the more impressive trends and news
stories covered by WDN over the past year--the stories that are likely
to have significance in the coming year.

  ...Circuit-Switched Data Solutions Are Made Practical

     Even as packet data networks struggled in the marketplace,
circuit-switched cellular slowly increased its subscriber base.  It is
difficult to differentiate circuit-switched voice and data traffic
over a network, but cellular carriers believe that their circuit-
switched data traffic is far heavier today than on any other wide-area
wireless data network.
     "I think in circuit-switched [in 1995] we did phenomenally.  I
think we put on more circuit-switched users than Ardis and RAM [new
customers] combined," said Sue Major, director-wireless data and
paging, Ameritech Cellular Services.
     Along with the obvious coverage advantages, circuit-switched data
popularity is advanced by a number of technical developments.  Modem
pools from 3Com Primary Access and AT&T Paradyne have been or are in
the process of being installed in major U.S. markets.  Not only do the
systems smooth the way for circuit-switched data communications, but
they provide gateways for intercommunication with other networks, such
as the circuit-switched/CDPD interface approved by the CDPD Forum last
summer.

WIDE AREA NETWORKS

     Many carriers, especially Ameritech, have had positive reactions
to the AirCommunicator, an integrated cellular voice/data
messaging/fax device developed by Air Communications Inc., Santa
Clara, Calif.  The communicator comes bundled with Air Communications'
"AirTrue" protocol, designed to simplify circuit-switched cellular
data transmission at 14.4 kilobits per second without having to route
through a modem pool.
     Ameritech signed a distribution agreement for the AirCommunicator
last fall.  The first shipments are expected to begin within weeks.

  ...SkyTel Launches First Two-Way Paging Service

     SkyTel Corp., a subsidiary of Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp. (Mtel), became the first national narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) carrier, taking advantage of an
FCC pioneers preference license awarded to Mtel.  That gave SkyTel a
head start over companies that won narrowband PCS licenses at auction
in 1994.
     A wide variety of applications are possible over narrowband PCS
channels, including e-mail access, faxing, voice paging, point-of-sale
transactions and telemetry.  However, "short messaging will be the key
application," said SkyTel President Jai Bhagat during the Wireless
Apps '95 conference in October, just a few weeks after the SkyTel
service began operation.  
     SkyTel operates with Motorola Inc.'s ReFLEXion 50 two-way paging
platform.  By the time other national and regional narrowband PCS
operators are ready to come on line, there should be at least one
rival technology.  AT&T Wireless Services is working with Pacific
Communications Sciences Inc. (PCSI), San Diego, to develop personal
air communications technology (pACT), which, unlike ReFLEXion, will
operate with equal forward and return channels, allowing users to send
and receive longer messages.
     An Israeli-based company, Nexus Telecommunications Systems Ltd.,
is testing a technology that would allow conventional one-way paging
carriers to get a piece of the two-way market.  Forward short messages
are sent over the paging network.  Acknowledgments in the form of
short canned responses are returned over the unlicensed 902-928 MHz
band.  Test systems have been established in Chicago, Minneapolis and
Orlando, Fla.  A consumer market test is planned for early 1996.

  ...New Voice/Data Handsets Previewed

     PCSI says it will begin offering an integrated voice/CDPD device
by the second quarter of 1996.  The PCSI device and similar products
that are under development by other companies will form a whole new
category of communicators which PCSI calls "personal access links"
(PALs).  They will be multifunctional devices designed with a heavy
emphasis on the communications features.
     Early personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheld
computer devices have not been successful in the marketplace because
their communications functions did not work well, many industry
analysts have said.  PCSI says that a number of devices introduced in
the last year, such as Motorola Inc.'s Envoy and Marco PDAs and pagers
developed for narrowband PCS, already fall within the PAL definition.
     The data phone will resemble "Simon," a voice/circuit-switched
data/page communicator designed by IBM Corp. and marketed by BellSouth
Cellular, which fared poorly after its 1994 introduction.  The PCSI
phone will be significantly smaller, lighter and less costly
(approximately $600 compared to over $1,000 for Simon).  It also
potentially could perform more applications.
     Users, for example, could get the latest stock values using CDPD
or access a data base to view a simple chart on the phone's liquid
crystal display.  The phone will e-mail short CDPD messages and alert
the user when a longer message is waiting.  The phone connects to
laptop computers and can act as a regular circuit-switched/CDPD modem.

THE WIRELESS LAN INDUSTRY ORGANIZES

     The technology for data transmission over unlicensed bands at 915
MHz and 2.4 GHz improved in 1995.  A wide choice of frequency hopping
and direct sequence wireless local area networks (LANs) are available
and wireless bridges and routers were introduced for increasing out-
of-doors coverage.  New unlicensed data options at 1910-1920 MHz and
2390-2400 MHz soon will be available.
     But many potential customers do not know about the wireless
options.   System developers, recognizing the problem, have begun
discussing the formation of an industry group dedicated to promoting
wireless LANs.  Discussions began among several companies in the fall,
including 3Com Corp., IBM Wireless Communications, Proxim Inc. and
Solectek Corp.  However, the talks are still at an early stage and
formation of the group could take several more weeks, people near the
group said.
     At the same time, a group of five companies--Digital Equipment
Corp.; Perfsoft Inc.; Raytheon Co.; Telxon Corp., and Cushcraft Corp.
(antenna system manufacturer)--formed the Wireless LAN Research Lab on
the campus of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester,
Mass.  The lab is planned as an ongoing project to refine data
communications over unlicensed bands, including performance testing,
benchmark development and development of new site planning techniques.
     The group is designing a wireless LAN test bed to conduct its
research. The test bed is being built with funds from a National
Science Foundation grant awarded to WPI's Center for Wireless
Information Network Studies.

  ...FCC Authorizes Equipment Sales for Unlicensed PCS

     Wireless campus-area voice systems now are available from a few
vendors, including Ericsson and Northern Telecom, for operation over
the newly opened unlicensed personal communications band.  All current
systems are operating over the 1920-1930 MHz isochronous PCS band. 
Later systems, expected to be FCC-approved and available by mid-1996,
will be integrated voice/data systems which will also operate over the
1910-1920 asynchronous band.
     The FCC cleared the way for the new systems last May by approving
a frequency coordination plan submitted by UTAM Inc. in summer 1994. 
UTAM has divided the United States, county by county, into areas that
immediately can begin unlicensed PCS operations (Zone 1) and areas
where operations can begin only after the incumbent microwave
licensees in or near 1910-1930 MHz relocate.  UTAM is collecting fees
on equipment sales in Zone 1 to apply to relocation expenses in Zone
2.
     It is expected to take several years to completely clear the band
for unlicensed PCS.  The process is likely to be hastened in many
areas by adjacent broadband PCS licensees that also are engaging in
microwave relocation talks.  UTAM will be benefitted by many of those
third-party relocations.  The group will, however, be required to
reimburse third parties for a share of the relocation costs.
     In comments on the FCC's proposed microwave relocation rules,
UTAM asked for flexibility in its repayment schedule.  Cost-sharing
should take effect after a third party assists in clearing all 1910-
1930 MHz microwave licensees in a county, UTAM said.  The obligation
also could begin once UTAM raises the Zone 1 maximum power level or
reclassifies a Zone 2 area to Zone 1.

  ...Apple and WINForum Propose New Unlicensed Services

     As early as this spring FCC could respond to petitions to
establish a new set of unlicensed data transmission services in
unlicensed 5 GHz frequencies.  Apple Computer Corp. of Cupertino,
Calif., proposed reallocating 300 MHz (5150-5300 MHz and 5725-5875
MHz) for an NII band--a wireless component to the types of services
being discussed by the federal government's NII Council.
     Apple suggested a short-range (6-9 miles), point-to-point
technology operating at high speeds of 24 megabits per second (Mbps)
to support applications not currently available over wireless data
networks.  Eventually, unlicensed terminals could be linked to form a
national communications service, Apple said, although the emphasis of
the petition was on community-wide communications.
     The FCC received a petition similar to Apple's from the Wireless
Information Networks Forum (WINForum), an organization of Washington-
based communications lawyers and engineers.  WINForum's "SUPERNet"
proposal is for use of 250 MHz (5100-5350 MHz) with less emphasis on
out-of-doors communications.
     Both Apple and WINForum propose compatibility with the European
HIPERLAN technology as a platform on which to build even more
sophisticated wireless capabilities.  Many European countries have set
aside 100 MHz (5150-5250 MHz) for HIPERLAN, which is designed for 24
Mbps operation in a campus-area environment.  However, a considerable
amount of development still is being done on the European system.  The
first commercial HIPERLAN deployments are not likely to occur in 1996.

IN BRIEF

     Digital Ocean, portable computer and personal digital assistant
(PDA) manufacturer, this week at the MacWorld 1996 conference in San
Francisco is introducing "Seahorse," a new line of rugged PDAs meant
for industrial wireless applications.  Seahorse devices, which are
based on the Newton OS 2.0 platform, are available in integrated CDPD
and 915 MHz wireless local area network versions.  The system also can
be configured for infrared communications, global system for mobile
communication links as well as global positioning service.  The
complete package sells for under $2,000.  Digital Ocean has scheduled
the CDPD version for the first deliveries which will be in mid-1996. 
(Digital Ocean, 913/888-3380.)

     Wireless Telecom Inc. (WTI), Aurora, Colo., says that it is able
to sell circuit-switched and CDPD data on a national basis after
signing new reseller contracts with several carriers last month. 
Companies needing the ability to integrate different circuit-switched
and packet data applications nationwide can now deal with one entity--
WTI--for all hardware, software and service needs.  New contracts with
Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet authorize WTI resellers
to offer CDPD and circuit-switched service from those carriers.  A
restructured contract with Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile adds a number of
markets, including Washington and Philadelphia, to an agreement that
already included New York and Boston.  Existing agreements with AT&T
Wireless Services and L.A. Cellular, a Southern California partnership
of AT&T and BellSouth Cellular Corp., complete WTI's national reach,
the company says.  (WTI, 303/338-4200.)

     E-mail software now is bundled and attractively packaged with
easy-to-use PC Cards.  The software itself is more user friendly. 
Devices designed for mobile e-mail links are coming down in price--
slowly.  The environment is right for a more aggressive appeal to
mobile professionals to try wireless data, executives at Motorola
Inc.'s Ardis packet radio service believe.
     "Ardis historically has loaded its network through the vertical
marketplace," said Dan Croft, Ardis senior vice president-marketing
operations.  The year-end 1995 subscriber total was about 50,000.  At
the highest, 10 percent percent of that figure is made up of mobile
professionals, Croft said.
     But he is encouraged about the chances of increasing that per-
centage through developments such as AirMobile, one of five e-mail
software applications supported by Ardis.  AirMobile allows Lotus
cc:Mail to run seamlessly over the wireless network.  "We don't ask
the user to relearn a software program, which we think is
significant," Croft said.
     Ardis last month simplified the pricing of its e-mail packages in
an effort to attract mobile professionals.  The four "DataPak" plans
based on kilobytes used per month (see chart) replace more complicated
packet-based pricing. Users
that exceed their basic kilobyte allotments will be charged 54 cents
per kilobyte in all plans.



                         ARDIS E-MAIL RATE PLANS
     DataPak 20     DataPak 150         DataPak 350    DataPak 750
******************************************************************
Base Rate           
     $19.95         $49.95              $99.95         $189.95

     20 kB          150 kB              350 kB         750 kB
******************************************************************



     The new rates apply to all five Ardis-supported e-mail applica-
tions, including AirMobile, RadioMail and Ardis's own PersonalMessag-
ing system.  Ardis plans to apply the same pricing to other future
mobile professional applications.
     Croft, who worked in the cellular industry during its early days,
sees similarities in wireless data today.  Cellular phones originally
were called cellular "radios," but carriers found it easier to market
them as "telephones."  "We're trying to achieve the same process [with
Ardis].  If you know how to use cc:Mail, you'll know how to use a
wireless link," he said.  (Ardis, 708/913-1215; http://www.ardis.com.)

RadioMail, ARDIS LOWER RATES FOR TWO-WAY MESSAGING

     RadioMail Corp. and ARDIS Co. (Advanced Radio Data Information
Service) announced that they have reduced the service fees for the
RadioMail wireless messaging service over ARDIS' wireless data
network.  The new rates went into effect Jan. 1 of this year.

     Mark Elderkin, RadioMail's director of marketing, said he
expects the new rates to help spur subscriber growth, which was
less than stellar in 1995 (WMR, Dec. 5, p. 2) but started to pick
up toward the end of the year.

     Users subscribing to RadioMail via the ARDIS network will be
charged $10 per month, plus usage fees of 5 cents per kilobyte (1
kilobyte equals 1,000 characters).  ARDIS also charges 54 cents for
each kilobyte above the amount allocated in the subscriber's plan,
but RadioMail said the typical subscription, including ARDIS Mobile
Office air-time rates, starts at about $30 per month.  ARDIS is a
reseller of RadioMail.

     The RadioMail service also is available on the RAM Mobile Data
Inc. wireless data network.  RadioMail buys capacity from RAM and
resells the RAM network service to customers, along with its
RadioMail messaging service.  Elderkin said his company is
negotiating with RAM to lower its access rates, but no change is
immediately forthcoming.  As a result, RadioMail via ARDIS
currently is a somewhat better deal for subscribers, though the
difference in cost is not terribly significant, he said.

     RadioMail charges $39 per month for 100,000 characters sent
over the RAM network, plus 16 cents for each block of 500
characters beyond 100,000.

     The messaging service is expected as well to be available over
several cellular digital packet data (CDPD) networks when cellular
carriers, such as Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet,
begin offering CDPD services in the first half of this year (WMR,
Dec. 5, p. 2).

Competitor Plans to Lower Rates

     RadioMail's primary competition is Wynd Communications Corp.,
a subsidiary of Calif.-based Call America Business Communications
Corp., which offers Internet access, integrated services digital
network (ISDN) service, toll-free 800-numbers and long distance
services (WMR, Feb. 14, p. 1).  The company's WyndMail offering,
which uses the RAM Mobile Data network to provide wireless e-mail
services bundled with paging, voice mail, text messaging, remote
local area network (LAN) mail access and other such services,
starts at a flat rate of $49 per month for 50 messages of 1,000
characters each, with a usage fee of 29 cents for each message
beyond 50.

     However, a Wynd Communications spokesman told WMR that Wynd,
too, is in the process of negotiating these rates with RAM Mobile
Data in an attempt to reduce charges associated with WyndMail, and
possibly to change the rate structure as well.

Wynd May Again Charge by Kilobytes

     Like RadioMail's current rate structure on the ARDIS network,
Wynd used to charge on the basis of kilobytes transmitted, but
recently switched to charging by characters.  However, according to
the spokesman, "a kilobyte plan is better for the customer,"
because it charges for aggregate data usage rather than for blocks
of characters.  Consequently, Wynd may go back to providing the
kilobyte plan for WyndMail, and an announcement regarding rates and
rate structures can be expected in the near future, the spokesman
said.

     RadioMail is based in San Mateo, Calif., and can be reached at
(800) 597-6245 or (415) 904-7070, ext. 263.  ARDIS can be reached
at its Lincolnshire, Ill., headquarters at (708) 913-1215.  Wynd
Communications can be contacted at (805) 545-5174; RAM Mobile Data,
at (908) 602-5500.

GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS FOR STOCKS IN WMR INDEX FOR 1995

     The good news is that 1995 turned out to be one of the best
years ever for stock price appreciation.  The bad news is that the
stocks of the wireless companies tracked by WMR seem to have peaked
in September, with the other major indices also showing signs of
fatigue.

     The 50 stocks that now make up the WMR Index (Telsoft Mobile
Data Inc. ceased trading a month ago) were down by about 2.2
percent in December - only their second monthly decline of the
year.  There were 20 advances, 28 declines and two stocks unchanged
during the final month of 1995.

     The closing prices for Dec. 29, 1995, and their comparisons to
Nov. 30, 1995, and Dec. 30, 1994, are listed in the index on p. 9. 
The same is done for the major stock indices in the chart below.

     The stocks suffered a bruising fourth quarter, posting a 5.1
percent decline over the period.  They did, however, gain 8.1
percent in the first quarter of 1995, followed by 15.7 percent in
the second quarter and 14.5 percent in the third quarter.  That
leaves them up by 30 percent for the year as a whole.

     The charts on pp. 8 and 10 indicate top gainers and decliners
for the past month and for the past year, while Tables 1-8 on p. 11
highlight the leaders and laggards within each of the four quarters
of 1995.

     As the line chart on p. 4 suggests, the WMR Index hit its peak
three months ago.  At the end of September, the WMR Index stood at
1805.  It ended the year at 1713.  Nevertheless, it began 1995 at
1261, which, after adjustments for stocks that entered and exited
during the period, indicates there was a 30 percent gain for the
year as a whole.

     During the same yearlong period, the Dow Jones Industrial
average was up 33 percent.  The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 34
percent in 1995, and the NASDAQ Composite grew by 40 percent.

     Compared to two years ago, the Dow actually is up by the
highest percentage of the four indices.  Since the final trading
day of 1993, the Dow is up 36 percent, while the NASDAQ is up 35
percent, the WMR Index is up 33 percent and the S&P 500 is up 32
percent.

     The Dow closed 1995 at a level of 5117.1.  The NASDAQ ended
the year at 1052.1, and the S&P 500 finished at 615.9.  They began
the year, respectively, at 3834.4, 752.0 and 459.3, and each
continuously set new records toward the end of the year.

     As the data in the line chart on p. 4 illustrate, the WMR
Index and the three major indices dipped in mid-1994, recovered by
the end of the year and spent most of 1995 on a steady decline. 
Taking the levels of each in December 1993 as a base point, their
courses through the past two years show how each fared month to
month.

     Interestingly, each registered two monthly declines in 1995
and 10 advances.  For the Dow 30 and the S&P 500, the declines came
in August and October.  For the NASDAQ and the WMR Index, the
declines came in October and December.

     Over the past two years, the biggest monthly gain for the WMR
Index (+9.4 percent) came in July 1995.  The biggest monthly
decline came in March 1994, when it fell 6.0 percent.  That also
was the worst month of the past 24 for the three major stock
indices.  Meanwhile, the Dow's and S&P 500's best month was
November 1995, while the NASDAQ's biggest percentage gain came in
June 1995.

Showings in December

     Only three stocks were up by more than 10 percent during
December.  Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd. topped the gainer
list with a 16.5 percent advance, closing the year at $37, just
fractions of a point below its new high.  The stock, which began
trading in February at about $15, fell as low as $11.50 before
staging a comeback in November.

     Sony Corp., another company whose stock suffered through the
early and middle months of 1995, also closed 1995 on a high note. 
It closed December at $61.38 a share, up $7.50 a share from a month
before, but up only $5.25 from a year ago.  Still, it was one of
the Top 10 gainers in December.  BellSouth Corp., which also set
new highs at the end of 1995, was up $4.63 for the month and up
$16.44 a share for the year.

     There were an unlucky 13 stocks down by more than 10 percent
during the month.  They include the 10 listed in the chart on p. 8,
plus Vanguard Cellular Systems Inc., Racotek Inc., and Grupo
Iusacell SA de CV.  The biggest decline was Cirrus Logic Inc.,
which fell $9.25 during the month and $2.75 for the year.  The
company simply fell out of bed in the past few months, declining
from a high of $61.13 a share to a low of $11.13, before recovering
to $19.75 by year's end.  In the fourth quarter, the stock declined
65.5 percent, edging out Retix and Nokia Corp. for that dubious
distinction.

     Nokia, meanwhile, closed the year at $39 a share, up $1.50
from a year ago but more than $30 below its recent highs of the
summer months.  It announced some sluggish results for its cellular
telephone operations and the market drove the stock down.  This is
a company that continuously has led the monthly gainers lists.  In
fact, it's still more than triple its price of December 1993.  But
it's up only 4 percent for 1995, after adjusting for a stock split.

     Another former high flyer, wireless modem maker U.S. Robotics
Inc., also has turned on the fasten-seat belt sign.  It's down
$22.50 a share in December, which sounds bad until one realizes
they were up $17.50 in November and $7.25 in October.  So it's
really trading at its September price, give or take a few dollars. 
And it remains the top performer for the year, having quadrupled
since the end of 1994.

     Other top gainers for the year include Bolt Beranek and Newman
Inc. (BBN), Microcom Inc. and Pronet Inc.  Each has more than
doubled in price during the past year, although Pronet fell $1.25
a share during the final month of the year.

8 CDPD Carriers Outperform Market

     Eight wireless data and/or cellular digital packet data (CDPD)
carriers outperformed the market as a whole, meaning their stocks
appreciated by more than the 30 percent to 34 percent of the
general indices.  The top-performing carrier was BellSouth, up
$16.44 a share or 60.7 percent, followed by NYNEX Corp., Ameritech
Corp., GTE Corp., Sprint Corp., MCI Communications Corp.,
Southwestern Bell (SBC Communications Inc.) and Bell Atlantic Corp.

     There were nine companies down by more than 10 percent for the
year.  In fact, there were 13 decliners and 37 advancers for the
year as a whole.  The big losers for the year were Retix and Grupo
Iusacell.  Grupo Iusacell can at least blame the Mexican economy
and the run on the peso for its woes.  But Retix is in its 23rd
month of decline, falling from a price of $10.38 in January 1994. 
It closed 1995 at $2.13 a share, down $1.88 for the year and 6
cents for the month.

     Tables 1-8 on the facing page highlight the top gainers and
decliners in each of the quarters of 1995.  Interestingly, only 14
companies scored advances in every quarter, and nine of them are
cellular or wireless data carriers - some of the same names that
topped the list in the chart above.

Perfect Quarterly Scores

     The companies with perfect quarterly scores are Ameritech;
Bell Atlantic; BellSouth; BBN; GTE; Hewlett-Packard Co.; MCI;
NYNEX; Pronet; Rockwell International Corp.; SBC; Southern New
England Telecommunications Inc. (SNET); Sprint; and U.S. Robotics. 
However, only BBN and U.S. Robotics were consistently above average
for each of the four quarters.

     Average growth in the first quarter was 8.1 percent.  In the
second quarter, stock price growth averaged 15.7 percent.  In the
third quarter, prices were up 14.5 percent.  And in the final
quarter, the average share price decline was 5.1 percent.

     Racotek nearly doubled its price in the first quarter.  Cirrus
Logic was a top performer during the first and second quarters. 
Globalstar took the top spot in the third and fourth quarters. 
U.S. Robotics was second or third for the first three quarters,
though it fell out of the Top 10 (to 18th place) in the final
quarter.

     No company suffered four quarterly declines in 1995, but three
stocks were down for three out of the four.  They were:  AllTel
Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Samsung Ltd.  In addition, American
Paging Inc. and Nextel Communications Inc. suffered two quarterly
declines plus one quarter in which their stock price was unchanged.

     Besides the aforementioned hammering that Cirrus Logic took in
the fourth quarter, Intelligent Electronics Inc.'s 37.6 percent
decline in the third quarter and Iusacell's 36.2 percent decline in
the first quarter are the biggest quarterly declines of the year.

     During the first three quarters of the year past, there were
three or four stocks in period that were down by more than 10
percent.  In fact, in two quarters, only eight stocks declined at
all, making a Top 10 Decliner list impossible, as Tables 4 and 6
prove.

     In the fourth quarter, however, there were only 22 gainers and
28 decliners.  Of those, 21 declined by more than 10 percent.  Only
the Top 10 are listed in Table 8.

     Among the decliners of the fourth quarter, one common theme
emerges.  Investors began to reassess the outlook for cutting-edge
companies and their respective technologies, trimming back their
expectations for companies such as Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp. (Mtel) and General Magic Inc., which are leading
the two-way paging and personal communicator markets, respectively.

     But as the market proved earlier in 1995, it also can reward
companies such as Globalstar and Metricom Inc., whose prospects for
cutting-edge wireless data ventures at one time seemed
questionable.  And as millions of widows and orphans know, the
safest bet in the telecommunications market continues to be Ma Bell
and her offspring.

ARCH TO ACQUIRE WESTLINK FOR $210 MILLION IN CASH

     Arch Communications Group Inc. has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire Westlink Holdings Inc. for $210 million in
cash and the assumption of $130 million in Westlink debt.  The deal
will make Arch the third-largest paging carrier in the United
States, with more than 2.5 million subscribers.  Arch will finance
the acquisition through an existing credit line and additional
loans.

     As a privately held company, Westlink was formed in 1994 to
acquire the paging assets of U S WEST Paging Inc.  The company
operates paging systems in a 14-state region west of the
Mississippi, while most of Arch's paging assets are concentrated
east of the Mississippi.  According to C.E. Baker Jr., Arch's
chairman and chief executive officer, the acquisition "will
effectively complete the geographic footprint that makes us a
national player."

     Arch, based in Westborough, Mass., also will gain access to
other paging licenses through Westlink's 49.9 percent stake in
Benbow PCS Ventures Inc., the winner of two regional narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) licenses sold at a Federal
Communications Commission auction last year.  Arch currently owns
about 11 percent of PCS Development Corp., a Greenville, S.C.,
company that won five regional narrowband PCS licenses at the same
auction, and plans to resell that company's two-way paging services
when commercial operations are launched in 1997.

     Arch can be reached at (508) 898-0962.

APC, MARYLAND AGENCY FACE PCS INTERFERENCE PROBLEMS

     American Personal Communications (APC) has rejected claims
that its personal communications service (PCS) system is
interfering with the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system. 
In a recent letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration
(MTA) stated that the new wireless service has caused "serious
interference" to the communications operations of light rail and
bus services operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
(GHz) spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it
had distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's vice president of external affairs,
expressed concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to
"politicize" the effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to
other spectrum bands.  The relocation of incumbent operators has
been a contentious issue since the Federal Communications
Commission first drafted rules requiring 2 GHz licensees to clear
that band to make way for new PCS licensees.  The commission
recently clarified rules adopted in the Engineering and Technology
Docket 92-9 "emerging technologies" proceeding, further defining
"good faith" negotiations over relocation issues between licensees
(WMR, Oct. 24, p. 6).

Interruptions a 'Grave Threat'

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall upon which APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27, 1995, letter
stated.  The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs
incurred as a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman
Anthony Brown declined to comment further on the interference
problems, noting that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Schelle told WMR that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.

     The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that APC
planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials failed
to respond to a single one.

     "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are informed
of the complete parameters of those facilities' operations.  APC
fully protected the facilities represented on MTA's FCC license and
could not have known, without being informed by MTA, that MTA is
operating at a variance from those parameters."

COURT SHOULD CONSIDER Mtel LICENSE SEPARATELY, FCC SAYS

     The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has told the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Washington that it should not consider the
commission's licensing scheme for private paging licensees in its
deliberations on whether Mobile Telecommunication Technologies
Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a license obtained through the agency's
"pioneer's preference" program.

     Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no. 94-1552,
Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the commission's authority to
charge a $33 million fee for the company's narrowband personal
communications services (PCS) license without first receiving
congressional authority (WMR, Dec. 10, p. 5).

     During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.

'Others Paid Substantially at Auction'

     "Mtel is a licensee in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in
a newly allocated frequency band," the agency explained, adding
that all other licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid
substantial sums for their licenses at a government auction.

     The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an advanced
two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge, Mtel did not
apply for a private paging license at 929-930 [megahertz]," it
said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit substantial amounts of
money to its narrowband PCS licenses when private paging licenses
were 'free' undercuts its assertion in this court that the
commission is applying different rules to identical licenses," the
agency added.

MobileComm PROVIDING NATIONWIDE SINGLE-FREQUENCY PAGING

     MobileMedia Corp. has completed its previously announced
acquisition of BellSouth Corp.'s paging subsidiary, MobileComm, and
its narrowband personal communications services (PCS) licenses for
$930 million (WMR, Sept. 25, p. 6).  The combination of the two
companies gives MobileMedia a total of more than 4 million paging
units in service, making it the second-largest paging services
provider in the United States, the companies announced Jan. 4.

     With the completion of the largest acquisition in the history
of the paging industry behind it, MobileMedia will begin to market
all of its paging and messaging services under the MobileComm
brand.

All to Single Frequency During 2nd Quarter

     All MobileComm services are slated to begin using a single
frequency within the wireless spectrum sometime during the second
quarter of this year.  The frequency is in the 900 megahertz PCS
band for which MobileComm owns licenses nationwide.

     "This [will be] a significant benefit for our retailers and
the consumer," said Bill Stark, MobileComm's executive director of
retail distribution.  "By offering the one frequency, multicity
retail chains will be able to reduce the number of SKUs
[stock-keeping units] stocked in their warehouses while providing
a wider range of services....

     "Paging subscribers will also benefit from the move to single
frequency," he added.  "With the new single-frequency pagers,
consumers enhance their paging service without having the hassle
and expense of changing their pager."  When the single-frequency
offering is launched, all MobileComm pagers will operate in all
cities covered by MobileMedia's nationwide wireless network.

     MobileMedia is headquartered in Ridgefield Park, N.J., and can
be reached at (201) 462-4965.

PageNet OPENS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DIVISION

     The largest paging company in the world has announced plans to
target the consumer market with a major new marketing and
distribution strategy.  Paging Network Inc. (PageNet) formed a
National Accounts Division that will work with large regional or
national companies to offer paging services as part of a package of
other consumer services, such as long distance or local telephone,
or cable television.

     Michael DiMarco, formerly PageNet's vice president of
corporate development, now senior vice president of operations for
the National Accounts Division, said he expects the division will
have a "dramatic impact on PageNet's growth and expansion into new
markets, particularly among consumers."

     The company currently has a substantial reseller channel,
established in 1992, that includes more than 6,000 businesses that
purchase air time and pagers from PageNet and resell them mostly to
business users.  The National Accounts Division, however, will
establish a different kind of relationship with its partners:  It
will provide customized, turnkey paging programs - including pager
leasing, customer service, order fulfillment and billing, in
addition to paging service - that the affiliate can offer to
customers as a bonus in an attempt to increase sales.

     MCI Communications Corp. began marketing PageNet's services
with its Friends & Family Connections program in early 1995.  The
success of that program led to the development of the new marketing
and distribution strategy, which was announced Jan. 4.  GTE Corp.
and the Sprint Telecommunications Venture became affiliates of the
program in December.  The National Accounts Division plans to
target other telecommunications carriers, as well as banks, cable
television providers, utilities, retailers and other companies, for
participation in the new program.

     PageNet, whose National Accounts Division is based in the
Dallas area, can be reached at (214) 985-6791.

STORM PROMPTS DELAY OF AUCTIONS UNTIL JAN. 16

     Citing poor East Coast weather, Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) officials decided Jan. 10 to postpone three
auctions of radio spectrum licenses until Jan. 16.  An FCC
spokesman told WMR that auction participants - bidding
electronically from Boston, New York and Philadelphia - were socked
in by the same blizzard that shut down the federal government for
four of the five business days last week.

     "In fairness to the bidders, the commission decided not to
restart the auctions until next week," the spokesman said last
week.  A number of bidders told the FCC that staff resources have
been limited by the winter storm that hit major cities along the
East Coast early last week, the spokesman said.

     A public notice regarding the delay was posted on the Internet
Jan. 10 and sent to auction participants Friday.

GLOBAL ACCESS LAUNCHES SINGAPORE OFFICE

As part of its continuing commitment to international
expansion, Global Access Telecommunications Services, Inc., a
leading provider of worldwide satellite and fiber transmission
services for the television and video industry, has opened its
Singapore office.  Global Access' Singapore subsidiary, Global
Satellite and Video Services (Asia) Pte Ltd., headed by Simon
Patch, director of brainess development, Asia Pacific, will
coordinate business for the entire Asia Pacific region.

The newest Global Access office, headquartered in Singapore's
New Tech Park, will be providing broadcast services for a
number of significant customers in the Asia Pacific region,
including ESPN in SingVore, STAR-TV in Hong Kong, and Fuji
Television and Nippon Television in Tokyo. In delivering
satellite transmission services to the Asia Pacific market,
Global Access draws upon 13 years of experience in providing
satellite and fiber broadcast services worldwide.

"As the Asia Pacific broadcast television market explodes,
Global Access is poised to build on the satellite services we
have been providing the region for years," said Jack Morse,
president and CEO of Global Access. "We have experienced staff
with intimate knowledge of the local broadcast market and
issues, and our multilingual Singapore operations center is
seamlessly integrated into our U.S. and U.K. offices. With the
leadership of Simon Patch, we can provide our Asia Pacific
clients with around-the-clock, around-the-world services."

Patch, who brings more than 26 years of experience in the
telecommunications industry to the position of business
development director, has also served as a vice president at
Keystone Communications and business director for Visnews.
Global Access' Singapore-based staff also includes Denise
Lekowski, international services coordinator. Lekowski, most
recently international liaison for Keystone Communications,
brings to the new operation years of expertise in the local
and international market. In addition to its local staff,
Global Access' Boston-based Keith Buckley, vice president,
sales, and Robert McNamara, director, international
operations, will put their combined industry and market
expertise to work for the Singapore operation.

Global Access' expansion into the Asia Pacific arena coincides
with the company's fast-paced European growth. Earlier this
year, Global Access acquired Business Television Services Ltd.
(BTS), a U.K.-based provider of business television and
special event services. BTS, now known as Global Access
Telecommunications Services Ltd., has been fully integrated
into Global Access' European operation, which offers both
business services to major corporations and broadcast services
for news, sports, and special events.

CABLE INDUSTRY NETWORK COMPETENCY CENTER CREATED

With the announcement of the Cable Industry Network Competency
Center, Digital Equipment Corporation has positioned itself to
become a driving force in the high-speed data communications
network industry. The Cable Industry Center offers network
consulting, integration, and management services to cable and
telecommunications companies around the world that are adding
high-speed data communications and Internet access to their
existing hybrid fiber/coax networks.

The Cable Industry Center, located in Littleton,
Massachusetts, is a logical outgrowth of the unique technical
and market experience Digital has gained over the past three
years. During that time, 60 high-speed data networks for cable
operators worldwide were installed to provide services to
local governments, schools and colleges, manufacturers,
healthcare institutions and telecommuters.

"We found that customers require both products and multivendor
integration services," said Larry Walker, vice president and
general manager of the Network Product Business Unit,
"therefore we have moved the Cable Industry Center from the
Network Product Business Unit to Digital's Network Services
group where its vast resources can be leveraged."

Graeme Shorter, vice president, Digital Network Services said:
"with this team of individuals we now have the experience,
skills, and knowledge to play a critical role as a partner in
the design, development, and deployment of complex, high-speed
data communications networks in the cable industry. This
market focus is an ideal complement to our existing network
business."

These networks provide users with high-speed access to the
"Information Superhighway," including Internet and on-line
services, as well as the ability to work at home, using
network connections that are 1,000 times faster than
conventional telephone modems.

In one of the initial projects for the Center, Digital
Equipment Corporation, MCI and Colorado Springs Cablevision
collaborated on a successful trial of the nation's first large
scale advanced telecommuting pilot during this past summer.
The Cable Industry Center is also currently working with
several other industry leading cable companies on their plans
to deploy new services.

Center Meets Urgent Need for Timely Network Implementation

Digital has created the Center at a crucial time in the
development of the high-speed data communications market. Many
service providers are now ready to move from the trial phase
to investment in full-scale full-service networks.

At the same time, changes in the regulatory environment are
opening up competition between telecommunications and cable
companies. Through the efforts of the IEEE 802.14 Committee,
the standardization and interoperability of technology for
multiple services over hybrid fiber/coax is fast approaching,
which will meet the needs of the cable industry.

"Multiple Systems Operators feel a great sense of urgency to
deploy networks," said Art Zins, managing director of the
Cable Industry Network Competency Center. "However, they worry
about making short-sighted decisions now that will preclude
other choices later. Our technical and business services can
help our customers implement flexible, modular, and economical
networks that meet their strategic business needs now and in
the future."

Leveraging Network Services and Multivendor Capabilities

The Cable Industry Network Competency Center staff bring with
them the skill and knowledge that was gained through
introducing and deploying Digital's ChannelWorks products
enabling high-speed data transmission over the existing cable
infrastructure.

As part of Network Services, the Cable Industry Center can
meet its customers' needs with cable data solutions that
employ products from multiple vendors. The Cable Industry
Center is establishing alliances with targeted cable modem
manufacturers and will continue to partner with cable
operators and systems integrators, as appropriate, to provide
the best-in-class solution. In addition, the Cable Industry
Center will be able to leverage the expertise of Network
Services' 1,300 network professionals and 40 Network Centers.
Network Services is part of Digital's Multivendor Customer
Services Division.

DIGITAL AND MACROMEDIA AGREE TO OFFER
DEVELOPMENT SOLUTION FOR APPLICATIONS
DEPLOYED ON INTERACTIVE NETWORKS

Mediaplex Application Development System Offers Best Of Class
Cross-Platform Authoring Environment

Digital Equipment Corporation and Macromedia Inc. (San
Francisco) have forged an agreement to create a development
solution for applications that can be deployed on desktop PCs,
the World Wide Web, and interactive broadband networks.
Digital's Mediaplex Application Development System will be
bundled with Macromedia Director, Macromedia Extreme 3D, and
Macromedia xRes. This enables developers to create multimedia
applications deliverable on multiple platforms for maximum
revenue potential at the lowest possible cost. As part of
their agreement, Digital and Macromedia will engage in joint
technical development and marketing, and provide technical
support to developers.

"We've already achieved critical mass with the number of
telecom and cable companies using Mediaplex servers in their
trials and deployments," stated Peter Ryus, director of
worldwide marketing, Digital's Video and Interactive
Information Services. "By combining Macromedia's authoring
technology with Digital's Mediaplex Application Development
System, we can offer both the platform and middleware strength
of Digital and the industry-leading cross-platform authoring
capabilities of Macromedia to provide developers a turnkey
content creation solution."

"Because we already have the Director Player running on a
variety of delivery platforms, we are in a unique position to
bring multimedia to the end user, regardless of the device
they have attached to the network," added Travis Huch,
Macromedia's manager of technology partners. "With their
cost-effective architecture and strong understanding of what
broadband interactive networks will look like, Digital is an
ideal partner."

Commenting on Digital's and Macromedia's agreement, Sasha
Magee, director of multimedia for Infrared Communications,
said, "This is really nice for us. Because we're already using
Director, Digital and Macromedia can now provide us with a
smooth and continuous path to move our business to the
broadband marketplace, particularly because both companies are
committed to delivery on multiple computing and set-top box
platforms."

Complete Authoring Resources

The Mediaplex Application Development System will incorporate
several Macromedia authoring solutions, including Macromedia
Director 4.0, a complete authoring resource for creating
multimedia productions; xRes, a tool for high-resolution image
editing and compositing; Extreme 3D, a modeling, rendering and
animation tool; and a digital sound editor, Sound Forge by
Sonic Foundry. For developers seeking to create content for
the World Wide Web, Shockwave for Director -- an application
for compressing and playing Director files on the World Wide
Web -- is included.

These products will enable developers to create client
applications that run on set-top boxes or PCs that are fully
integrated with the streaming capabilities of the media
server. For custom client/server applications such as
interactive home shopping, distance learning, and home
banking, Digital provides an optional software developer's kit
(SDK) that enables content creators to develop new classes of
application services on the server.

TECHNO-THEFT IS COSTING MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS MILLIONS

A dozen well-dressed men walk calmly into the front lobby of a
large corporation. Noting the visitors, corporate attire,
employees figure these are legitimate businessmen on their way
to a company meeting. They couldn't be more wrong. Surprising
everyone, the suit and tie executives suddenly pull out
automatic weapons and order employees to lie on the floor. In
a few terrifying minutes, they pillage the company's
computers, remove valuable memory chips and flee with
components having an estimated value of $5 to $12 million!

This latest chapter in an ongoing story of international
intrigue is not a scene from a James Bond movie. California
and is merely a small part of the disturbing trend of rising
computer theft and other "Techno-Crime."

In California's Silicon Valley alone, it is estimated that $1
million in components are lost to Techno-Thievery each week.
Worldwide, overall costs to electronics and insurance firms
are approaching a staggering $8 billion a year and are
expected to soar to $200 billion by the year 2000, according
to the Technology Theft Prevention Foundation in Clinton, New
Jersey.

The Foundation was started by insurance companies who, after
paying out millions in computer theft claims, wanted to
develop ways to curtail the rising Techno-Crime Wave.

According to FBI and other law enforcement agencies who are
working with the Foundation, Techno-Crime can come in many
forms that may or may not be considered thievery. But as far
as theft is concerned, although everything from motherboards
to modems and disk drives are targeted by Techno-Thieves, CPUs
(Central Processing Units) and SIMs (Single In-Line Memory
Modules) represent the crown jewels of computer theft.

"Basically, these parts are non-traceable, said Keith Lowry,
sergeant for the San Jose Police Department. "They are very
liquid just like gold, and the market for resale is fantastic
because there aren't enough products to go around;

It's big business and it's opportunistic," Lowry noted.
Manufacturers and consumers alike are being short changed
because Techno-Crime is having a substantial effect on the
quality of available memory products on both the wholesale and
retail markets.

Although electronic and computer buyers believe they are
getting a good deal, they are frequently getting ripped-off.
And the Techno-Crime Crime itself is sometimes not an obvious
one, such as that mentioned in the beginning of this story;
often the crime is difficult to identify and the price paid
can't be quantified--but consumers are paying the price. For
example, consumers are often attracted to flashy packaging,
which shows a product in its best light. Upon closer
inspection, however, the product within may not live up to the
advance billing given on the box. It is not uncommon for the
module inside not to have been manufactured or assembled by
the company shown. It is important that the consumer knows who
the real manufacturer of the product is and that it is a
reputable company--one that is respected throughout the
industry, no t just at the store on the corner.

"Everybody and their brother is slapping together cheap little
memory products," explained Jim Wong, president of Micro
Solutions, Inc., in Corvallis, Ore., designer of systems for
highly demanding users with specialized applications. "You
have to be very careful about who you buy from and what you
buy." cautioned Wong. "I've heard horror stories from people
who haven't been, but are now our customers because they can
constantly rely upon the quality we provide," Wong said.

With SIMMs comprising up to 50% of a computer system's cost,
and providing much of the computing power, the quality of
memory has become paramount, which has been a boon to
manufacturers putting emphasis on quality.

One such firm is Century Microelectronics, Inc., in Santa
Clara, California. Century, an industry leader in the
manufacture of computer memory, has implemented extra measures
to ensure its memory modules maintain the highest quality
standards.

One way Century does this is by dealing directly with only the
largest, most reputable DRAM manufacturers who have strict
internal controls. Century then adds its own quality
protective measures. For example, each assembled module bears
the Century name to insure strict accountability. The consumer
can clearly identify that the module has been assembled by
Century and not another third party manufacturer with lower
standards. Unless the circuit board manufacturer puts their
name on the board as Century does, there is virtually no way
to trace the product back to the manufacturer when troubles
arise.

Companies like Century use the highest quality components not
just in the DRAM, but in the design and manufacture of the PC
board as well. This philosophy has so far served companies
like Century well in the marketplace where wholesalers,
retailers and consumers have voiced concern over the affect of
Techno-Crime on overall product quality. "A big part of my
business is the ability to give my customers the reliability
that they are getting a first rate part," said Gary Barlow,
owner of RAMTECH in Boulder, Colo., the computer memory
supplier to a majority of users in that area.

"Most of the time price is not the issue as long as you're
reasonable," Barlow explained citing his reason for relying on
Century as his prime memory supplier. "I've been in this
business a long time and I believe Century has the highest
quality parts available," he said. Micro Solutions' Wong who
often utilizes Century products because of their inherent
reliability, agreed with Barlow on stressing quality. "We're
just a small company so what's really important is who our
clients are and the type of machines that we configure," Wong
explained. "We have some pretty major clients like Hewlett
Packard who buy our memory products for insertion into their
own machines so quality is very important to us."

To less scrupulous suppliers, however, price, not quality, is
the primary motivator. Because of competition from makers of
cheap "clone" systems, keeping costs down has become paramount
to both supplier and manufacturer. In this market climate,
even well known original equipment manufacturers (OEMS)
sometimes offer to buy back old memory chips as credit towards
new memory purchases. These suppliers then reuse the memory,
which, since it is used, has a shorter life cycle.

While this might not appear to be an obvious Techno-Crime to
the consumer, such as armed theft or the like, it is, in fact
Techno-Crime in its worst form because while the monetary cost
is just as severe, the crime itself is all but impossible to
detect.

Another factor in the link is when OEMs put pressure on chip
suppliers to step-up production so that increasing market
demand can be met. To please their OEM customers, memory
brokers with limited resources are often tempted to purchase
substandard parts in the "gray market" because they are being
offered a deal that is too good to pass up.

Of particular concern to manufacturers is that substandard
parts within the gray market have often failed to test to
"grade All specification and instead of ending up as scrap or
in a lower performance non-computer application as intended,
the y often end up in machines where they are not up to the
task.

A chip that shows a 60 nanosecond (60ns) rating, for instance,
could really only be able to perform up to a 70ns level.
Pressed for time, unscrupulous suppliers can't be bothered
with checking for quality so substandard memory batches are
either mixed with those having passed inspection, or are
simply remarked with the higher rating that OEMs require.

To remark a product, third party manufacturers will actually
sand the identifying marks off of chips, remark them so that
they appear to be higher performance chips than they actually
are, and resell them to unsuspecting buyers. The
manufacturers, then, end up installing the lower quality
components in their machines because many trust their memory
distributors to bench test the chips. But unfortunately, many
distributors in need of quick revenue unload the components
without testing them. Installed in machines they weren't
intended for, these parts fail immediately, or after a few
months of use.

And while a substandard chip may only cause a computerized toy
to go haywire, it could just as well put a glitch into the
navigational system of a commercial airliner or cause a
surgical device to malfunction, putting patients at risk. Even
if only a small percentage of available computer chips are
faulty, but are resold as acceptable, the implications are
frightening.

Because popular new software programs require more memory than
ever to operate efficiently, technology market analysts say
the demand for memory modules is likely to remain higher than
the supply. Manufacturers will probably continue to experience
periodic chip shortages which will drive up the value of
memory modules, and drive more OEMs into the gray market.
Consumers should understand that they can easily fall victim
to Techno-Thievery without realizing it because Techno-Crimes
are not always obvious. Unless buyers take extra precautions
to ensure the quality of the product they are buying, they run
the risk of purchasing substandard components that could not
be able to perform up to advertised specifications, or could
fail altogether causing disastrous results.

In light of all this, consumer awareness is increasing and the
demand for superior computer components from the highest
quality manufacturers is expected to be greater than ever.

System Alerts
Drowsy Drivers

In what has been billed as a first of its kind effort, scientists
at the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI, 5000 Forbes Ave.,
Pittsburgh, PA 15213) are developing a comprehensive sensor system
to combat drowsy driving.

The project, which got underway in June 1995, is supported by a
two-year, $1.2 million contract from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA, Washington, DC) and will be completed
by mid-1997.  Some additional engineering support is being provided
by the Volvo/GM Heavy Truck Div. The National Private Truck Council
(Alexandria, VA) assisted in selecting the test vehicles.

The NHTSA is supporting a program to combat drowsy driving, with
particular emphasis on heavy trucks because of the severe damage
these accidents cause, and the toll in human lives they extract.
Over the years, surveys have shown that drowsiness, related fatigue
and inattention are the major causes of truck driver fatalities.

Since mid-1995, CMRI scientists have been assessing, testing and
developing effective drowsy driver sensor technologies.  At the end
of the project they hope to have available a set of functional
specifications for drowsy driver alert systems that can be
manufactured for use, first in trucks, and later in cars.

Richard Grace (Tel: 412/268-3493) of the CMRI Advanced Devices and
Materials Group, and project co-director, said this is a two phase
effort.  Phase I, now in progress, involves selection of sensors,
systems engineering and reliability testing and finally,
installation in the selected test vehicles.  Two physical
prototypes are being produced, and will, of course, be subject to
further modification depending upon the outcome of testing.

Phase II, starting in June and running until mid-1997, will consist
of data collection under actual over-the-road conditions and
relating this information to previously developed drowsiness
measurements.

Grace said the prototype system will be comprised of a black box
installed next to the driver's seat, a sensor on the steering
column, two video cameras (one to scan the driver's face along with
a video recorder to capture reactions and another pointed out the
window), a floor-mounted accelerometer, a powerful on-board
computer to store test data, and an audio warning device possibly
dashboard-mounted.

There also will be a video-based lane position sensor with a
Pentium processor.  This is the same unit that was developed by
Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Lab, and which was featured prominently
in last year's "No Hands Across America" trial (ATTN, September
1995).

These modules will communicate with each other through an Echelon
(Palo Alto, CA) LanWorks communications bus.  The several modules,
while being designed as stand-alone systems, will interact with one
another as a distributed control system.

The three main units will "decide" if the driver is drowsy, and
then relay this information to an independent warning system,
possibly an audio device that will alert the driver.  Grace noted
that the system modules are basically simple, inexpensive to
produce and could have multiple uses in the truck.

In June, with all component testing completed, the system will be
installed in two tractor trailers supplied by Averitt Express
(Cookeville, TN).  Averitt specializes in package delivery with
many of its runs taking place between midnight and 8:00 AM.  The
test vehicles will be based at the company's Charlotte, NC
terminal.

In this second phase, the sensor system's ability to alert or even
rouse drivers will be thoroughly evaluated.  As part of the
process, a camera will document lane departures, and steering
column sensors will document erratic or jerky movements.  This
information will be correlated with data obtained from the
physiological and psychological measures that relate to the
driver's state of alertness, e.g., eye movement and eye closing.

Grace added that researchers developed drowsiness "standards"
through videotapes of drivers' eyes.  In other words, the
percentage of time they are open or closed.  For example, when
someone is sleepy, normal blinks which last about a millisecond,
are extended and a person can unknowingly end up with eyes closed
about 15% of the time. Kind of scary when driving a 16-wheeler
along a crowded interstate at maximum speed.

MLANS Could
Prevent Accidents

Nichols Research Corp. (NRC, 251 Edgewater Dr., Wakefield, MA
02146) is working with a technology that could provide computer
solutions to complicated problems not likely to be solved by past
artificial intelligence approaches.

The Maximum Likelihood Adaptive Neural System (MLANS), was
originally funded by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
(BMDO - 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-7100) for "Star
Wars" space-based uses.  Actual work started some seven years ago
when BMDO was looking for a way to automatically recognize targets
in clutter and noise.

NRC is currently developing a number of system applications based
on this technology.  Of primary interest to the ITS universe is the
work being done on MLANS-based collision avoidance systems and
computer-assisted road navigation systems.  These were demonstrated
during a recent test of unmanned Army vehicles.

MLANS analyzes sensor data streams and adaptively classifies and
tracks objects of interest while suppressing clutter and noise.
The system used supplied object models and adapted them to changing
environments, or adaptively constructed statistical models of what
objects looked like, then refined the models as it sorted through
the stream of image data being received.  The recent tests
demonstrated the feasibility of road tracking on dirt, gravel and
paved surfaces as well as areas that were shaded and leaf covered.

According to Leonid Perlovsky (Tel: 617/246-4200), NRC's chief
scientist, the unmanned navigation vehicle technology has not as
yet been tested under actual highway conditions.  He noted that his
company's efforts are still in the development stage and any
commercial offerings are still some years away.  Perlovsky also
said this point can't be reached without significant investment and
at present, there is no way of knowing what kinds of dollars will
be required.

In taking a closer look at the technology involved, neural networks
are computer systems that can recognize an object by "learning"
from previous experiences or input.  Their design uses the
principle of brain organization--a large number of interconnected
processing elements called neurons.  Neural networks are attractive
because they can be created without the lengthy and tedious process
of eliciting rules from human experts and then coding them into a
computer.

The MLANS, as developed by NRC, solves the long-standing artificial
intelligence problem of combining adaptive learning with prior
knowledge by using a priori models in a neural architecture.  With
fuzzy logic, each piece of data is associated with the appropriate
a priori model.

MLANS has been coded in a variety of programming languages,
including FORTRAN and C, and runs on any number of systems,
including personal computers.

In addition to ITS applications, MLANS-based systems have potential
uses for law enforcement agencies and can also be used for medical
diagnostics, oil exploration, or for locating objects under foliage
and in heavy clutter.

Perlovsky cited the development, for NASA research and rescue
operations, of an MLANS-based detection algorithm to find small
aircraft that might have crashed in heavily wooded areas.

Military Technology
Makes Smart Trailers

Military communications technology originally designed to "get the
message through" in spite of jamming and other battlefield signal
interference will soon be used to locate and track trailers on
America's highways.

QUALCOMM Inc., (6455 Lusk Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/587-
1121) has signed an exclusive development and supply contract with
Elisra Electronic Systems Ltd. (29 Hamerkava St., Holon, Israel),
a subsidiary of Tadiran Ltd. (575 Lexington Ave., 21st Fl., New
York, NY 10022; Tel: 212/751-3600), for communications hardware for
Untethered TrailerTRACS, QUALCOMM's new trailer tracking system.
The "TRACS" stands for Thin Route (low data rate) Alpha Numeric
Communications System.

The agreement also gives QUALCOMM exclusive resale rights in this
country for trailer tracking applications with rights to extend
worldwide and to include other specific markets such as barges and
trains.

According to Jim Clifford, QUALCOMM OmniTRACS Div. director of new
product development, this is representative of Elisra's efforts to
introduce, into the commercial marketplace, technology originally
developed for military applications.

Untethered TrailerTRACS itself should be commercially available
during the fourth quarter this year. Standard price for a single
trailer system is expected to be $790.  The basic monitoring rate
will be about $10/unit/month.

Clifford said prototypes are now being tested and evaluated, and
one goal will be the ability to track a trailer within 1500 ft.  He
also noted that an optional GPS capability will be available to
track within 300 ft.  Designed to QUALCOMM's specifications, the
unit is about the size of a book and measures 8 in. by 4.9 in. x
2.4 in.  Enclosed in an ABS case, it can operate within a
temperature range of -40(C to +70(C.

The unit is battery powered.  When the tractor and trailer are
paired, it works off the tractor's 12v electrical system.  When
unhooked, the battery takes over.  It can be recharged from the
truck when the trailer is connected and has a 35-45 day life span
while disconnected.  The system also offers battery condition and
present charge-level monitoring.

The unit can be mounted inside a trailer wall.  Separate
omnidirectional antenna packages offer the option of mounting
either high on the "nose" of the trailer, or flat on the roof.  The
roof mounting requires approximately a half-inch clearance.

Untethered TrailerTRACS will provide two-way messaging and position
determination of any trailer while connected to or disconnected
from the tractor.  Using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite service
from ORBCOMM (21700 Atlantic Blvd., Dulles, VA 20166; Tel: 703/406-
5310) which provides global coverage.  The OmniTRACS Division is a
reseller of ORBCOMM services to the trucking industry.

Initial service using two satellites will be "intermittent," with
three to four satellite looks per day at any point on the earth.
Near continuous coverage is expected in 1997 when ORBCOMM is
scheduled to launch an additional 24 satellites. Clifford noted
that this system essentially takes the intelligence that now
resides in the tractor and puts it in the trailer.  He explained
that Untethered TrailerTRACS offers exception-based messaging.

For example, an itinerary can be stored in the trailer unit.
Information might include appointment times, specific destinations,
layover time, trucking company involved, tractor number, or
whatever.  If the trip goes according to plan, no messages will be
sent.  If there is a delay, the unit can recalculate and if an on
time or near-on time arrival is indicated, there still won't be any
messages.

However, if a trailer didn't move when expected, or an unplanned
move took place, or the wrong trailer is connected or disconnected
to a tractor or a trailer is late for an intermodal drop, an
exception alert is triggered.

This information is sent immediately to the OmniTRACS Network
Management Center (NMC) in San Diego (CA) and then routed to the
customer for action. The center is staffed around-the-clock every
day.  And there also is a back-up center in Las Vegas (NV).

Clifford pointed out an additional feature of the system:
refrigeration system monitoring.  On an exception basis, reefer
data is sent over-the-air to alert users to an immediate problem,
e.g., wrong set point, refrigeration unit failure, unloaded reefer
running, or temperature out of range.  Wherever possible,
corrections can be made remotely, or help can be summoned.

QUALCOMM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on its
proprietary digital wireless technology.

Elisra  is known for its electronic warfare systems and develops,
manufactures and markets advanced electronics products, including
sophisticated jammers, RF and microwave components, ELINT systems
and data links

Amtech to Track
Grocery Chain Fleet

Last month, Amtech Systems Corp. (17304 Preston Rd., Bldg. E100,
Dallas, TX 75252-5613) signed a $310,000 contract with H.E.B (San
Antonio, TX), the nation's 13th largest grocery store chain, to
supply a wireless system for paperless, non-stop identification of
its motor freight fleet.  Beverly Fuortes (Tel: 214/733-6059),
Amtech's director of corporate development, said the system is now
being installed and should be fully operational in March.

The wireless system will use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
technology to provide real-time information on the 1,500 tractors
and trailers in the H.E.B. fleet.  Equipment will be deployed at
terminal gates at the grocery chain's 262 stores throughout the
southwest.  H.E.B. will use the Amtech system to improve equipment
and inventory accuracy, as well as to eliminate paperwork and
increase employee productivity by automating the vehicle tracking
procedure at terminals.

With Amtech's SmartPass readers in place at terminal exit and entry
points, all motor fleet equipment with an RFID tag will be
identified immediately, even at unmanned terminals.  The grocery
store chain will use the Amtech system, in conjunction with its
existing system, to gather information and match it with fleet
information in the company's database.

With this real-time data in hand, H.E.B. will be able to monitor
operations, increase tracking capabilities and improve asset
management - all through wireless data communications.

Clinton Inks 1996
Transportation Bills

The fiscal year 1996 Dept. of Transportation (DOT) appropriations
bill was signed late last year by President Clinton.  The bill
includes $223 million for federal aid to ITS projects, down about
$4.5 million from $227.5 million last year.  The DOT can now
proceed with development of a plan to reorganize its surface
transportation activities.

Also part of the bill is a $17.5 billion obligation ceiling for
highways which represents a $300 million increase over present
levels.  Another $2.3 billion will be available for emergency
relief and minimum allocation programs, bringing the total for
highways to $19.9 billion, only $545 million below the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) authorized level.

Generally speaking, the transportation budget was up by $1.8
billion over 1995's $35.58 billion.  But transit funding was cut by
$600 million from 1995 levels, and includes $2 billion for formula
grants and $1.6 billion for discretionary grants.  Transit
operating assistance was cut by $310 million to a level of $400
million.

According to ITS America, congress will give serious consideration
to dropping the practice of earmarking funds for ITS in next year's
bill.

Funding (in millions) breaks out as follows: $24.5 for R&D, $32.5
for operational tests, $14.5 for Commercial Vehicle Operations
(CVO), $14.0 for Automated Highway Systems (AHS), $11.3 for program
and system support, and $13.0 for crash avoidance research, for a
total of $109.8 million.

At the same time, the president signed into law the National
Highway Systems (NHS) bill.  This legislation designates a national
system of primary highways and bridges, some 160,000 miles worth,
considered essential to the country's economy and defense.

Among the bill's provisions are the controversial repeal of the 55
mph speed limit and a repeal of funding penalties for states that
fail to enact motorcycle helmet laws.  It also delays indefinitely
any federal mandates to use signs with metric measurements, and
waives until 2000, federal requirements that states convert their
plans and specifications to metric.

Fare Hikes Become
Nationwide Trend

According to a report recently released by the American Public
Transit Association, (APTA, 1201 New York Ave. NW, Washington, DC
20005; Tel: 202/898-4115), four out of 10 of this country's public
transit systems will raise passenger fares and cut back service
during 1995, mostly as a result of reductions in federal transit
aid.

APTA said a survey of 157 transit agencies showed that fare
increases during the year will average 25% and that a typical
service reduction will represent 11% of existing bus and train
service.  More than three-quarters of the responding agencies said
state and local governments are not likely to replace the lost
federal funds.

The cuts will hit hardest at lines serving small and rural areas.
For example, an urban transit system might raise fares about 20%
and a medium area about 23%.  However, small/rural area riders
could be looking at a 34% increase.  The same impact ratios prevail
in the other categories.

Transit agencies attributed about three-quarters of the fare hikes
and service cuts to past and pending reductions in federal transit
operating assistance.  In the federal fiscal year just ended,
operating grants were reduced by 11.5%, and legislation pending in
Congress could cut remaining funds by another 44% in FY 1996.  In
total, federal operating assistance will be cut in half, from $802
million in Fiscal Year 1994 to $400 million. Of the responding
agencies, 36% plan to delay expansion and 40% could cut service and
raise fares.

Recent fare increases implemented by New York City's Metropolitan
Transit Authority (MTA) are a case in point.  Not only will they
apply to subways and busses, but later in 1996, to bridges and
tunnels as well. Over the past 13 years, the MTA has spent $20
billion to rebuild and modernize its system, especially the
subways.  The results are bearing fruit and have drawn wide praise
from many of its millions of daily riders.

With state and federal subsidies being cut substantially, the MTA
has had to raise bus and subway fares by 20% from $1.25 to $1.50,
and commuter rail fares on average by 9%, making these rates among
the highest in the country. Beyond that, there is the threat of
reduced service, fewer improvements and less attention paid to
maintenance and passenger comfort.  Not a pretty picture overall.

In looking at the prospect of higher fares, one individual
concluded that even with a 20% increase, the subway still was still
a better deal than having to drive, put up with traffic and having
to pay even higher parking fees.

In light of all this, late last month, President Clinton signed
into law H.R. 2002, the Fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill for
the Dept. of Transportation (DOT).  The law cuts federal transit
aid 12.2% overall in contrast with 1995, and includes reductions of
48% in operating grants for transit agencies serving metro areas of
200,000 or greater.  Smaller systems will experience a 25% cut.

Neural Network
to Control Traffic

Nestor, Inc. (Providence, RI) and Matrix Corp. (1203 New Hope Rd.,
Raleigh, NC 27610-1474; Tel: 919/231-8000) are working with Jet
Propulsion Lab at the California Institute of Technology (JPL,
Pasadena, CA) to develop VideoTrac, an advanced traffic
surveillance system.  This effort is being administered by JPL for
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA, Washington, DC).

According to Matrix and JPL, VideoTrac "will increase traffic
capacity on existing roads and reduce the need for new highway
construction."  Delivery of the system is expected sometime during
the fourth quarter this year.

VideoTrac will use video cameras, Matrix's Advanced Traffic
Controller (SmartATC) and Nestor's Ni1000 Recognition Accelerator
chips to recognize moving vehicles on highways and intersections.
The Ni1000 neural network chip, developed jointly by Nestor and
Intel, is at the heart of the system.  Matrix will incorporate the
chip into a compact, low cost module that will plug into advanced
traffic controllers like the Caltrans 2070 or TS3.

The system can control traffic signals, notify drivers of traffic
conditions and redirect traffic.  Unlike systems that use sensors
buried under the roadway, VideoTrac will be able to recognize
vehicles by type (car, truck, bus, motorcycle), monitor speeds,
turn and lane switching movements, travel times, and even report
accidents.

The chip simultaneously performs these functions at full-motion
video speeds across multiple lanes.  It will "see" the number of
cars heading its way and know the speed of each.  At an
intersection, a traffic control device could decide whether to
extend a green light or stop traffic because a line of vehicles is
waiting in the intersection.

David Mosier, Matrix president and CEO, said, "There are
approximately 250,000 intersections in the U.S. that would
potentially benefit from video detection technology, as well as
tens of thousands of highway locations."

Nestor, by the way, develops and markets business information
systems that extract actionable knowledge from data through pattern
recognition.  Among the company's offerings are N'Route software
that reads and distributes faxes electronically, NestorReader and
OmniTools, intelligent character recognition software, and PRISM
for identifying fraudulent bankcard transactions from subtle
patterns of purchasing behavior.  Next stop: the Interstate.

GDS Partners with
Israel's MAVIX

Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way, Suite 250,
Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484) has established an alliance
with MAVIX Ltd. (Haifa, Israel).  Both entities hope to create an
interface between their respective technologies.

 MAVIX provides remote intelligence surveillance monitoring and
control systems for the transportation and security industries with
an emphasis on Automatic Traffic Management Systems (ATMS).  GDS
offers real-time Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions for
ATMS, traffic operations centers, transit information, vehicle
permitting and routing, and Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency (ISTEA) management.

A GDS spokesperson said his company and MAVIX are currently working
on three joint traffic system proposals but nothing is ready to
announce at this time.

MAVIX's monitoring and control systems include color cameras with
pan, tilt and zoom remote control, vehicle loop detectors, ramp
metering devices, variable message signs, audio devices and traffic
signal monitoring devices. Signals from these devices are
transmitted via bi-directional connectivity to traffic control
centers to provide real-time, full-motion visual monitoring of
traffic conditions, as well as voice connection with traffic
control personnel and roadway SOS locations.

As a result of this partnership, traffic information processed by
the MAVIX system can now be reviewed in real-time as color coded
maps on the GDS GIS-based software system.  Maps will display the
current locations of objects, events and their relationships, as
well as current traffic conditions at any given moment.  Traffic
control operators will be able to analyze and respond immediately
to changing conditions and incidents as they happen.

Both companies look on this partnership as a way to build open
systems that "are never closed to future options but allow for
expansion of capacity and functionality in an efficient, resilient
manner."

Ford and China
Look at 'Good Earth'

Ford Motor Co. (The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:
313/337-2456) and researchers from the Peoples Republic of China
(PRC) have joined in a cooperative effort to develop catalytic
converters using rare earth metals for vehicle emission control.
The three-year cooperative catalyst research program got underway
at the end of last year, and will receive more than $1.5 million in
funding support from Ford and several Chinese government
organizations.

China has the largest proven reserves of these metals which can be
used in catalytic converters to cut vehicle emissions of
hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.  The country
recently adopted legal guidelines for auto emissions which ban
production, sale or import of cars that exceed established
pollution levels.  The joint research effort will also investigate
environmental solutions to help mitigate China's rampant air
pollution problems.

John McTague, Ford VP of technical affairs, said, "Rare earth
oxides, alone or possibly with the addition of small amounts of
precious metals, could create a robust emission control catalyst
that China can produce for its own market or for potential export."

Rare earth oxides, in particular cerium and lanthanum, combine with
other metals to improve the performance of an automotive emissions
catalyst.  During changes in driving speed and fuel mixture, the
rare earth oxides can either store or release oxygen into the
exhaust mixture and keep the catalyst performing under more
constant conditions and at a high level.

These oxides can also help in cold-start emissions control.  When
the catalyst is cold during the first few minutes of operation, it
operates inefficiently, so much so that it is during this period
that the majority of hydrocarbons are emitted.  If the catalyst
could be moved closer to the engine and be able to withstand the
higher operating temperatures, it could warm up more quickly and
reduce cold start emissions.

With a new emphasis on stricter emission standards by government
regulatory agencies, research interest in rare earth oxides has
increased.  The Chinese are looking to use these oxides as a major
component of catalytic converters for their domestically-
manufactured vehicles, while minimizing the use of precious metals,
e.g., platinum, palladium and rhodium.

$7 Billion Future for
OEM Safety Markets

A study just released by Business Communications Co. (BCC, 25 Van
Zant St., Norwalk, CT 06855-1781; Tel: 203/853-4266), explores
current markets and future business opportunities for OEM
automotive safety electronics in light vehicles assembled in this
country and Canada.

According to the study, "the average safety electronics content now
stands at $329 per vehicle, and is equivalent to 1.7% of the total
value of the average light vehicle produced in North America."  The
report goes on to predict that over the next five years, sales of
automotive safety electronics are expected to increase 8.6% per
year, reaching $7.19 billion by the year 2000.

By then, the average automotive safety electronics content is
expected to reach $485, equivalent to 2.0% of the total average
vehicle value. The future will continue to brighten as the public
begins asking for more safety features and the automobile
manufacturers begin meeting this demand with new and better
technological approaches.

The study declares that "the next five years will witness the near
universal adoption of ABS and driver- and passenger-side airbags.
Four-wheel ABS will also largely supplant two-wheel systems during
this period.  Rapid growth in side-impact and other airbags will
present strong business opportunities as will Traction Control
Systems (TCS)."  Other growth areas involve production of anti-
theft devices and collision avoidance systems.

The report calls attention to changes in the safety electronics
market.   These include lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventory
management, outsourcing, supplier consolidation, greater design and
engineering responsibility given to suppliers, and increasingly
sophisticated systems as more advanced electronic features are
added to vehicles.

With this in mind, the study goes on to say that the next five
years will see more supplier consolidation among the automobile
companies, increased electronics content and expanded supplier
responsibilities.  "This will, however, provide unique business
opportunities for those suppliers able to adapt to the new
environment," the report concludes.

Available from BCC for $2750, the report covers such technologies
as air bags and related passenger restraint systems, ABS, collision
avoidance and warning systems, electronic traction control, anti-
theft devices, and other safety electronics.  It also covers in
detail the socio-political, economic, regulatory and technological
issues that are regarded as critical to the industry's current
state of change.

Etak Realigns
Product Lines

Etak, Inc. (1430 O'Brien Dr., Menlo Park, CA 94025; Tel: 415/328-
3825) has realigned two product groups through a merger of its
Information Group, which focused on product marketing development
and sales, with its Commercial Solutions division.  The company
said this will allow it to take advantage of the fast-growing
market for highly detailed, accurate, electronic road maps and
business demographic data.

Last year, Etak created business units to better focus on the needs
of the particular markets it serves.  It found considerable
crossover development between the Information Group, which
specialized in geographical marketing products, and the Commercial
Solutions group which was involved with operations such as
facilities management, routing and scheduling, fleet management,
property risk and call-before-you-dig applications.

Since the Information Group's geographical marketing products were
also of interest to commercial customers, it made sense to
consolidate the groups, according to an Etak official.

Products previously sold thorough the Information Group in
Princeton, NJ, and now under the Commercial Solutions umbrella
include TargetView, a Microsoft Windows-based geographical
marketing system that combines Etak's digital street maps with
locations of more than nine million businesses and 85 million
households nationwide; PostalPoints, a database of Postal Service
ZIP+4 code locations, and Eagle Geocoding services which allow
rapid matching of addresses to map locations.

Key customers who use the marketing-related products include Acxiom
Corp. and Database America Companies, developers of a number of
business and industry data products. Etak's other marketing
groupings are the Automotive Products division offering digital map
and navigation software products for vehicle navigation and
information systems, and the ITS Group, offering technology and
market development strategies to the ITS market that includes major
mass transit facilities.

Intermodal EV
Trials to Continue

The National Station Car Assn. (963 Hillcroft Circle, Oakland, CA
94610) intends to "charge ahead."  According to Victoria Nerenberg,
the organization's president, "The momentum built in the National
Station Car Program is so strong that it will continue despite
changes in any of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates."

She was referring to California's recent decision to back away from
a requirement that within two years 2% of all cars sold in the
state be electric powered.  The state's Air Resources Board asked
for a suspension of this requirement, and a final decision has yet
to be made.  There also were claims of automobile industry pressure
on state officials to make the change.  Both Massachusetts and New
York followed California with similar mandates, and a Federal
appeals court in New York recently upheld that state's right to
proceed with the California plan.  No word on Massachusetts.

(Earlier this month, General Motors announced that this fall it
would be selling an electric car, the EV1, in Los Angeles, San
Diego, Phoenix and Tucson.  A GM official said there was no
incongruity between hints of industry pressure and the marketing
announcement.  Called the first vehicle designed specifically for
electric propulsion, it is expected to sell for about $35,000.)

Nerenberg is the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District manager for
the San Francisco Bay Area station car demonstration (ATTN,
December 1995).  She noted that plans are already underway to
expand the demonstration "far beyond" the 40 cars that will be part
of the initial demonstration begun late last year.

The Association's executive director, Martin Bernard (Tel: 510/839-
6054), said station car demonstrations will be expanded or
initiated in South Florida, Atlanta, the New York City suburbs, New
Jersey and Northern and Southern California.

Station cars are small electric passenger vehicles driven to and
from mass transit stations by transit riders.  They are an
extension of mass transit, providing the same mobility as
conventional vehicles.  While away from the station they can be
used for any type of short trip.

Rome Adopts
GDS Software

The airport serving Rome (Italy) has purchased software from
Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way, Suite 250,
Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484) to manage its
infrastructure, including facilities, the land surrounding the
airport, runways, and underground networks.

Rome Airport handles approximately 70% of all airline passengers in
Italy, or about 20 million annually.  Airport officials expect that
number to double by the year 2002.

The GDS Automated Mapping/Facilities Management (AM/FM) and
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) capabilities will be used for
the airport's expansion projects currently underway on various
areas of the airport's facilities and runways.

GDS will be used to map and manage the landbase area of the airport
and manage the thousands of construction change documents
associated with the project.  Personnel will also be able to use
the system's Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CAD) function for
2-D or 3-D drawings of the airport's physical structure and for
facility development and management.

The airport has 12 sets of GDS software running on seven Digital
Equipment Co. (DEC) Alpha workstations with support from two Alpha
servers linked by optic fiber.  One server functions as an
applications development system.  The other is split into
individual client centers where the work is divided into facilities
management, land management and runway development.

Raytheon Stars
with FAA

The Raytheon (141 Spring St., Lexington, MA 02173; Tel: 617/860-
2414) Electronic Systems Standard Terminal Replacement System
(STARS) team recently passed the Federal Aviation Administration's
(FAA) Operational Capability Demonstration (OCD), the last step in
qualifying the team to bid on the FAA STARS replacement program.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) from the FAA for STARS is expected
this month.

The STARS system will modernize and upgrade more than 240 Terminal
Radar Approach Control Systems (TRACONS) in the present FAA
National Airspace System which serves both civilian and military
installations.

This modernization program, valued in excess of $1 billion dollars,
will replace aging terminal automation equipment and will interface
with the FAA's en route system, also scheduled for modernization
under the Display System Replacement Program (which includes
Raytheon's controller workstations).

The Raytheon demonstration featured the company's AutoTrac system
for full service level functionality, Hughes (Information Systems,
Fullerton, CA) TracView system for emergency service, and UFA's
(Lexington, MA) ATCoach system for the test and training simulator.

Integrated for the STARS OCD, these open-architecture systems have
been hosted on a variety of commercial off-the-shelf hardware
platforms for terminal and en route applications in 19 countries.

In another move, Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (swisscontrol)
awarded a $5.5 million contract to Raytheon Canada Ltd. (Waterloo,
Ont.; Tel: 519/895-0110) for two air traffic control primary
radars.  They are scheduled to become operational in mid-1997.
Other bidders for the project were Westinghouse, Thomson-CSF and
Alenia.

According to Richard Gaffney, president of Raytheon Canada, it is
the company's "first win in Europe against stiff international
competition."  At the present time, 27 solid-state radars are
installed worldwide, and an additional 30 are under production.

The contract calls for Raytheon to provide two ASR10SS primary
radars for the Zurich and Geneva airports.  These are the company's
latest generation air cooled, all solid-state primary surveillance
radars.  The contract also includes the production, installation
and testing of the complete system.

PR Program to
Deflect Driver Ire

There's always some pain associated with progress, or so it seems.
And when it comes to new highway construction, millions of
motorists the world over have tales of woe to tell.

 But in New Mexico, the Middle Rio Grande Council of Governments
(MRGCOG,  317 Commercial NE, Albuquerque, NM 87102) and the New
Mexico State Highway and Transportation Dept. (NMSHTD) are
embarking on a project they hope will ease the pain of a $35
million major reconstruction of I-40 scheduled to take anywhere
from two to three years to complete.  Work on the highway, which
runs right through Albuquerque, will start this spring.

In an effort to minimize the impact of the construction in the
urban area, maintain an orderly traffic flow, reduce driver
frustration and promote alternate forms of transportation, MRGCOG
and the NMSHTD decided to initiate a construction impact public
awareness program.

Holmes & Narver, Inc., (H&N, 6501 Americas Parkway, NE,
Albuquerque, NM 87110; Tel: 505/889-4100) has been named to a team
charged with developing and implementing a campaign to promote
community awareness of the construction project and how it will
impact on local streets, freeways, arterial roadways and the area's
transit system.  This public relations effort will run through 1988
or later.

Susan Johnson & Associates, an Albuquerque public relations firm,
heads the team with H&N providing advice on construction impacts,
congestion and transit concerns.  The effort, which will cost about
$300,000 is being funded partly by National Highway System
construction money along with state and local dollars.  A first
draft of the program should be ready next month.

Ron Forte (Tel: 505/247-1750), MRGCOG's director of transportation,
said there will be massive disruption where I-40 runs through part
of the city.  Also there will be considerable ramp work and very
little opportunity to divert traffic.  "We've never done anything
like this before and we're always being criticized for construction
delays and a lack of information.  So we decided to develop a
program to let drivers know what is open or closed and when, and
what progress is being made.  We want them to know what's happening
every step of the way," Forte added.

Driver information will be provided by variable message signs,
billboards with message banners that can be changed without redoing
the entire billboard when new information becomes available,
newspaper and television advertising, and standard construction
signage.

Forte said the campaign signature will be New Mexico's state bird,
the Road Runner (not the famous cartoon character).  It will appear
on signage and advertising related to the project.  While motorists
won't be able to move through construction zones with the speed of
a Road Runner, they will at least know what's ahead.

MDOT Truck Permits
Go Automatic

The Michigan Dept. of Transportation (MDOT, State Transportation
Building, 425 W. Ottawa St., P.O. Box 350, Lansing, MI 48909; Tel:
517/373-2090) has purchased Permitting and Routing Solutions (PARS)
commercial vehicle permitting automation software for
oversize/overweight vehicle operations.  The system is being
supplied by Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way,
Suite 250, Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484).

MDOT is now studying ways to configure existing data to meet new
system requirements and also to determine just what data will be
needed to ensure maximum efficiency.  GDS says the software should
be in place by the second quarter this year.

MDOT issues some 120,000 trucking permits annually to enforce
compliance with motor code requirements for truck weight, height,
length and width. Currently, this is a totally manual operation
handled primarily by the Lansing office.  Each permit requires a
written application along with a permit evaluation by a DOT permit
agent.

Agency personnel fax proper documents back and forth to permit
stations around the state, and any delay in response to these
trucking permits can result in lost revenue for the state, and at
times, illegal hauling.

When PARS is in place, the entire process will be automated. Within
a matter of seconds, it will handle everything from ensuring
application compliance and determining a safe route, to issuing and
automatically faxing permits, and accounting for all transactions
involved.

David Spangenberg, MDOT engineer - utility permits, said, "Once
PARS is up and running, maximum turnaround time will decrease
instantly and we will eliminate as much paperwork as we can."

PARS, which is designed to automate a full range of operations
associated with permitting and routing oversize and overweight
vehicles, was released by GDS late last year.  The software
package, originally known as RouteBuilder, was acquired from PEAK
Solutions Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) early in 1995 (ATTN, May 1995).

Keeping BART's
Passengers Informed

Daktronics, Inc. (331 Thirty-Second Ave., P.O. Box 5128, Brookings,
SD 57006; Tel: 605/697-4300) has received a $1 million contract
from San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District for
Light Emitting Diode (LED) variable message signage.

The contract calls for the design and manufacture of 44 outdoor
Destination Sign Units (DSU) for installation in five new train
stations.  BART also has the option to purchase and install an
additional $3.6 million worth of DSUs over the next five years as
funding becomes available.  These additional signs will replace
those in the other 34 BART stations.

The DSU system will consist of two-sided LED signs located over
passenger areas in the BART rail stations.  Signs will feature
full-matrix LED displays capable of showing up to four lines of 3
in. high variable text, as well as graphics and animation.  The
DSUs will communicate safety tips, BART rules, train arrival times,
train destinations, public service announcements, advertising, and
most importantly, the time.

DSUs will be controlled by BART's central control computer which
communicates via the Ethernet network.  This same computer also
operates all BART trains.

BART, a rapid transit rail system, serves passengers in the five-
county area surrounding San Francisco.  It currently includes 34
passenger stations and four routes -- about 72 miles of double
track.

Is There Maglev in
Houston's Future?

Most efforts to make Magnetic Levitation (maglev) transportation a
reality in this country are either in proposal, planning or early
prototype.  Now, added to that mix is the effort of a group of
students at the University of Alabama (Huntsville).

They have brought forth a proposal outlining the financial and
engineering feasibility of a high speed maglev transportation
system operating in a corridor between the Dallas/Fort Worth and
Houston metropolitan areas.

Maglev, a high-speed magnetically levitated ground transportation
system, offers transportation options which can augment existing
transportation systems.  The maglev vehicle can travel at speeds up
to 300 mph, carry 1200 passengers per hour per direction for the
corridor and also provide transportation for high-value, time
sensitive freight.

The proposal noted that there is a significant market opportunity
for a maglev to service the Dallas-to-Houston area.  The maglev can
expect to capture substantial portions of the air passenger and
freight markets, and 5% to 9% of the enormous automobile passenger
market.   Although the passenger rail market is extremely small,
maglev should capture significantly all of this market and 75% of
the air freight market.

A detailed financial performance indicated that a maglev project is
financially feasible.  It is projected to make money and
simultaneously provide venture capitalists with a high rate of
return and an exit mechanism from the project.

A comprehensive risk analysis, using simulation, indicated an
overwhelming probability of positive financial outcomes for the
project.  The project's projected measure of success, Net Present
Value (NPV), was predicted positive for over 95% of simulated
scenarios.  However, a significant financial commitment from the
federal government would be required to build such a system from
Dallas/Ft. Worth to Houston.

The maglev system is technologically feasible.  The actual
engineering design presented in the proposal was based on the
concept proposed by the Foster-Miller Team in their System Concept
Definition (SCD) study awarded under the National Maglev
Initiative.  It uses mature superconducting magnet technology.

Modifications to the concept were made to enhance revenue and
reduce the cost of building the system.  The proposed design
consists of an at grade, single track guideway with a passing track
in the middle and meets both the passenger capacity and light
weight freight requirements.

A major advantage of maglev is that because the vehicle operates
with almost no moving parts, maintenance requirements are
significantly reduced.  The system is anticipated to have a useful
life of 50 years.  In this design, a derailment situation is
virtually impossible.  The proposed maglev system would be safer
than air, rail or conventional road transportation.

Skycar: New PRT
from Korea

Skycar, a Korean entry in the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)
technology race, is under development by Woobo Enterprises Company,
Ltd. (Samwon Building, 5th Floor, Nonhyun-dong 210-1 Kangnam-Ku,
Seoul, Korea; Tel: ++ 822-549-6011 or 822-549-6211/3).  Information
on how far the project has gone is somewhat sketchy.  However,
Woobo is currently looking for financial support for engineering
and testing.

Work on Skycar began in 1992 and several feasibility studies for
specific sites in Korea have been conducted.  It appears that the
Skycar PRT concept is very similar to the American TAXI 2000 PRT
concept but with important differences in the design of the
guideway and in the use of an electromagnetic switch instead of a
mechanical switch.

According to Woobo, the system would feature three-passenger
vehicles, a linear motor, and guidewheels for stabilization and
steering.  The proposed guideway is a "U" shaped steel structure
with integrated power supply, signal, communication, steering and
control equipment.

Performance specifications are based on a minimum headway of 1/2
second, maximum capacity of 7,200 vehicles per hour, average
capacity of 6,000 vph, maximum passenger capacity of 18,000 persons
per hour and average capacity of 9,000 persons per hour (at an
average occupancy of 1.5 persons per vehicle).

Average speeds are expected to range from 28-35 mph (45-60 kph).
Last year, a propulsion system development study and a
control/communication system development study were performed by an
independent company.  Woobo also established an adjunct
Transportation and Urban Research Institute to further development
of the Skycar concept.

Highway Good News,
Highway Bad News

In the short space of a week, two of this country's major daily
newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post carried
front page stories featuring the latest in highway technology.
However, when placed side-by-side, one article was filled with hope
and the other with considerable doubt.

First the good news.  In its January 2 edition, the Times heralded
the opening of the Riverside Freeway in Orange County, CA.  The
article commented, "In what transportation specialists say is a
bold experiment in traffic management in the state that made
traffic management both an art form and an oxymoron, a private
company has opened a brand new toll road, the most technologically
sophisticated highway ever built anywhere, smack in the median of
the old jammed road."

The existing Freeway, also known as Highway 91, is one of the most
congested in the state, carrying some 270,000 vehicles daily.
Commuters spend hours in their cars as they attempt to complete a
40 or 50 mile trip to work.

Now, for those willing to pay, the new $126 million, privately-
funded, 10-mile freeway will provide some respite from the daily
grind.  According to the Times, "California Private Transportation
guarantees that any commuter willing to pay the price will have a
delay-free, 65 mph ride through the bottleneck."

Much like telephone rates, toll charges will be based on time-of-
day usage (Value Pricing).  There will be five levels: 25 cents, 50
cents, $1, $1.50 and $2.50.  Three persons in a car ride for free.

These levels are designed to keep traffic moving by reflecting
changing traffic levels on the road.  The more traffic, the higher
the toll. Tolls are being collected electronically and there are no
toll lanes or booths.  Such familiar technologies as Automatic
Vehicle Identification (AVI) technology, transponders, and computer
billing are integrated into roadway operation.

The article noted that the Freeway's "ultimate quality control
device will be its toll schedule posted prominently for all to see
on overhead entrance signs. If at any point over the next several
months, traffic on the road becomes so heavy that delays occur,
fares will be raised for that travel hour until some of the
overload shifts to the old road, however jammed its eight free
lanes might already be."

In other comments, the story noted that, "Besides being the first
private toll road to compete with an adjacent free public road, the
new road is also the world's first fully automated toll road,
relying not just on transponders to collect fares but on other
space age devices to guarantee users a smooth safe ride."  These
include a traffic control center, remote television cameras and
"various combinations of lasers and computers to alert authorities
to problems."

Will it all work?  Only time will tell.

Now for the bad news.  In a story entitled, "Drivers Put the Brakes
on Toll Road's Promise," the December 26 edition of the Post noted
that, "The nation's first privately built highway (Dulles Greenway)
in 150 years has become an embarrassing flop, drawing only a third
of the traffic that the road owner and operator (TRIP II - 109
Carpenter Dr., Suite 200, Sterling, VA 20164; Tel: 703/729-4400)
had predicted."

Greenway traffic has been averaging 10,500 vehicles daily, and is
growing by only 1 to 2% a month, far short of original estimates of
34,000 daily customers.

(It was only last November that ATTN wrote about the Greenway being
completed six months ahead of schedule and under budget.  At that
time, congratulations were in order for those building this
privately owned and operated toll road, a 14 mi. route extending
from US Rte. 15 in Leesburg (VA) to the Washington Dulles
International Airport.  The Greenway also linked with the existing
10.4 mi. Dulles Toll Road, and opened for business last October.)

The Post article went on to say that revenue shortfalls are so
great that unless the Greenway can renegotiate loan terms or find
another source of funding, it will have to turn the road over to
its creditors.  The highway could remain in operation under such a
foreclosure, but TRIP-II could lose as much as $82 million.

In November, to stem its losses, the company laid off 19 full-time
and 20 part-time toll collectors, and to attract more drivers, it
postponed a scheduled January 1 toll increase to $2.00 from $1.75.
TRIP-II is even considering a toll reduction.  The Post noted that
this could backfire if traffic doesn't pick up enough to offset the
drop in revenue per vehicle.  The Greenway company did not release
any financial information to the Post, but the paper reported that
former company officials said first year toll revenue would amount
to about $7 million, compared with the company's targeted $27
million.

So what went wrong?  According to the newspaper account, "A review
of studies the company commissioned, and interviews with former
officials suggest that the Greenway investors made fundamental
mistakes in calculating traffic numbers." Most notably, they never
did any sensitivity studies to see if motorists would pay a $1.75
toll, they relied on outdated traffic flow research, and were
overly optimistic in selecting the first-year number of 34,000.

Also, the company struck what was termed an "ill-advised agreement
to collect for the state (VA) an extra 35 cents from Greenway
drivers getting on the Dulles toll road."  The idea was to spare
drivers the inconvenience of paying $1.75 at the Freeway toll plaza
and then stopping a half-mile later to pay the additional 35 cents.
The psychological effect, however, has been to make Greenway tolls
seem even higher than they are (a total of $2.10 for both roads).

At a mid-December meeting in New York City, Michael Crane, CEO of
the Greenway company, reportedly asked creditors to be patient
while the company conducted the marketing survey it should have
done previously and determines what changes to make in the toll.
He hoped lower tolls would attract riders who aren't using the road
now and added that changes will be made after the survey is
completed.

One Washington transportation researcher told the Post there needs
to be an off-peak discount.  "I'm surprised they haven't already
done that," he said.

MEETINGS

ITS America Ready
to Roll in Houston

The 1996 ITS America (400 Virginia Ave. S.W., Suite
800, Washington, DC 20024-2730; Tel: 202/484-4847)
Sixth Annual Meeting and Exposition is just "around the
corner."  Scheduled for April 15-18, at the George R.
Brown Convention Center in Houston, TX, the meeting
is expected to draw some 5,000 industry and government
executives, scientists and engineers, academicians,
researchers and other transportation professionals from
this country and overseas.

Featuring the theme, Realizing the Benefits, the event
will focus on the value of advanced communications,
electronic, and computer technologies in surface
transportation.

For the first time, special segments of the Annual
Meeting and exhibitor profiles will be broadcast by
satellite to local ITS decision makers around the country.
Combined with live uplinks from operational ITS sites
throughout the U.S., the broadcast will bring the national
ITS program directly to stakeholders unable to attend the
Houston meeting.

For those who will be there, a number of facility site
tours will be available, including NASA's Johnson Space
Center.  Actually, much of the ITS technology now used
in surface transportation was originally developed for the
aerospace and defense industries.

The overall program will consist of some 70 sessions
involving more than 320 panelists and presenters.


IRF Takes the
High Road

The International Road Federation (IRF) will be holding
its 13th World Meeting in Toronto from June 16-20,
1997.  The theme of the gathering is, Roads - Enhancing
the Economy, Sustaining the Environment.  While this
event will be taking place well over a year from now,
abstracts of technical presentations are due on April 1,
1996.

The program will cover the environmental and economic
impacts of transportation, transport planning, safety, road
design, ITS and innovations.  Among the more specific
discussion topics to be examined within these sessions are
High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) programs, driver
security, Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), safety
management systems, privatization, international
standards and new pavement technologies.

NATIONS SEEK 'PRIVATE' FUNDS
FOR LYON-TURIN HSR ROUTE 

  French and Italian authorities reinforced their support 
for the proposed high speed rail link between Lyon and Turin 
this month. The two governments have established an 
intergovernmental commission to push the project forward 
this year. Project officials claim the planning is currently 
on schedule, with an estimated completion date for the 
entire link of 2002.

  The intergovernmental commission "will study the 
possibility of financing the project," explains Maurizio 
Cavagnaro, president of Alpetunnel, the European economic 
interest group set up at the end of 1994 to coordinate the 
main tunnel section of the Lyon-Turin rail link. The group 
now involves representatives of seven ministries from each 
of the two countries, he says.

  As well as the strengthening of the commission from both 
sides, the project was highlighted by the French transport 
ministry (Ministere de l'Equipement, des Transports et du 
Tourisme, or METT) earlier this month as a possible lead 
candidate for private financing. In an interview with Le 
Monde, Anne-Marie Idrac, a junior French transport minister, 
suggested that the finance for the high speed line 
construction between Lyon in southern France and Turin in 
northern Italy may be the best option available for private 
investors to get involved in rail infrastructure projects.

  Up until now, the French government has resisted almost 
all calls from the European Commission (EC) and others to 
encourage private investors to support major rail -- or any 
other -- infrastructure projects. Idrac's assertions earlier 
this month were brought on in part as a result of the strike 
by French national railways (Societe Nationale des Chemins 
de Fer, or SNCF) late last year. Whatever the prompt, her 
remarks have been greeted with relief in Brussels.

  But how far is the French government prepared to go with 
private financing? This is a confusing issue, partly because 
"private" in the private finance term does not have the same 
meaning or implication in each European country, notes one 
senior rail industry observer. "The word is used very 
loosely" in France, he adds.

  When the French ministry and SNCF say private finance, 
they mean "a contribution from the interested regions who 
would get guaranteed bank loans," the observer explains. For 
the French side of the Lyon-Turin link, this would primarily 
involve the Rhone-Alpes region. They would then be able to 
"capture the development benefit directly," he adds.

  Cavagnaro, who splits his time between the Italian 
Railways (Ferrovie dello Stato, or FS) facility in Rome and 
the Alpetunnel offices in Chambery, France, is not surprised 
by the move to consider private finance for transport 
projects. Transport ministry officials from France and Italy 
"said at a meeting one year ago" that there were financial 
constraints at the two national rail operators, he says. As 
a result, that meeting concluded that for the trans-Alpine 
link, "construction of the new line will be in a concession 
in order to involve private money," he adds.

  But "that's only a first indication," Cavagnaro says. "Now 
the question will be studied by the intergovernmental 
commission and be studied by Alpetunnel to examine all the 
possibilities of the private and public partnership," he 
adds.

  The exact model to be used for financing the project has 
yet to be finalized. The whole project is expected to cost 
approximately ECU13.55 billion ($17.3 billion), of which 
more than ECU3 billion will be for the main tunnel section 
(see HST News, Nov. 13, 1995). The "Eurotunnel idea" is one 
option under consideration, Cavagnaro says.

  But given the financial fiascos surrounding the Channel 
Tunnel initiative since its inception, it would seem 
unlikely if this model were followed too closely for the 
Alpine project. Indeed, a document published by Alpetunnel 
draws comparisons with the Channel Tunnel. The so-called 
Tunnel de Base under the Alps "shall be slightly longer than 
the tunnel under the Channel," it notes. But "in spite of a 
geological site far more complex than that of the Channel, 
the provisional cost of the tunnel is less."

  "The intergovernmental commission will be operating now in 
January, and I think the end of this year it will be 
possible to report to the two governments" on the 
recommended financing model to follow, Cavagnaro says. 
Assuming it is a concession, as initially concluded by 
representatives from the two governments, "the concession 
will be in place maybe in 1998," he adds.

  The French transport ministry is still only lukewarm at 
best on the possibilities of private investors wanting to 
get involved in track construction projects. Idrac has 
indicated that the government may help out SNCF on some 
construction projects, while leaving the private finance 
door ajar.

  Within the French ministry, "there is a subset of young 
Turks who try to loosen things up" with regard to financing 
options, the rail industry observer comments. But if SNCF 
and the METT are to go down the private investment track, 
"there is a legal step" necessary in France in order to 
"loosen the shackles," he adds.

  The Lyon-Turin high speed rail project is one of the 14 
European transport priority projects. It is described in EC 
documents as one of the "key links" in the European high 
speed network, primarily connecting Lyon through Turin, 
Milan and Venice to Trieste in the north east of Italy. For 
the key link, however, the majority of the work is required 
on the French side of the project.

  The new line in France -- a dedicated passenger rail 
facility -- will link Lyon with Montmelian. Clearly the most 
expensive sections of the project will be the Belledonne 
Tunnel from Montmelian to St Jean de Maurienne, and then the 
main 54 km (33 mile) Tunnel de Base continuing on to Susa 
over -- or rather under -- the Italian border, capable of 
taking freight and high speed passenger rail services in 
parallel.

  "The project is going ahead" and some of the first main 
construction decisions are already being made, Cavagnaro 
says. "The first problems are the decisions for construction 
of the test tunnels. These are very important works," he 
stresses. "There are three test tunnels to study the 
geology," he explains. Two of these will be in France, with 
the other in Italy. "We have started the project of the 
civil works" for the test tunnels. "At the end of this year 
will be the start of construction of the test tunnels," he 
adds.

  The French and Italian governments approved an FF800 
million ($200 million) study program for the Alpine tunnel 
at the end of 1994. Approximately one quarter of this was 
allocated for work carried out last year. In addition, the 
EC has granted the Lyon-Turin project ECU9.0 million for 
feasibility study support.

AMTRAK SCALES BACK
NEC ORDER SIZE;
FEBRUARY DECISION DUE

  Bending to the constraints caused by a lack of capital 
funding in fiscal year 1996, Amtrak's Board of Directors has 
approved plans to order just 18 high speed train sets for 
the Northeast Corridor (NEC), with an option for two 
additional fossil-fuel units.

  Amtrak has repeatedly insisted it had no plans to reduce 
the number from 26 train sets, despite reports from sources 
inside the company that it would be forced to do so (see HST 
News, Nov. 13, 1995).

  Amtrak officials decline to say whether pressure from the 
two competing consortia triggered any reduction in the 
proposed purchase.

  The Board of Directors now is expected to select a winning 
consortium next month, choosing either Siemens 
Transportation Systems or the GEC Alsthom/Bombardier team. 
ABB Traction was dismissed by Amtrak from further 
negotiations last month (see HST News, Dec. 25, 1995).

  Amtrak spokeswoman Erin Clarke acknowledges that the 
company now hopes to obtain just 18 train sets. "The number 
of train sets is 18, and we're in final negotiations," 
Clarke says. "We'll be awarding the contract in February." 
Amtrak expects an initial delivery of 12 HSR trains by 
October 1999, and "two of those 12 would be prototype train 
sets that would be delivered in 1998 for testing."

  Fiscal constraints finally forced Amtrak to reduce its 
projected equipment order, Clarke acknowledges. "Of course, 
Congress has been very supportive of the train set program, 
but has not appropriated funds for it this year [fiscal year 
1996]," Clarke notes. "We've had great support -- but 
support doesn't buy train sets." Amtrak must move ahead 
using previous federal appropriations and possible vendor 
financing, she says.

  The prototypes must be tested at the Association of 
American Railroad's (AAR) Transportation Test Center (TTC) 
in Pueblo, Colo. Asked if TTC delays could postpone the 
introduction of the new trains on the NEC still more, Clarke 
says it's not likely. "A lot of the testing will take place 
in Pueblo," she says, but delays are unlikely because "so 
many folks" will be involved. Paradoxically, the range of 
tests, including anything from noise to the comfort of 
internal amenities, will be so intense "that we don't 
anticipate any problems."

  Clarke unveiled Amtrak's revised plan Jan. 7 to a sparsely 
attended session on high speed rail during the recent 
Transportation Research Board (TRB) annual meeting in 
Washington, D.C., whose attendance was severely impacted by 
blizzard-like weather. "There were almost no presenters from 
our group, except myself," she quips.

  Clarke adds that, contrary to rumors that surfaced at TRB, 
Amtrak is still exploring the purchase of non-electrified 
fossil fuel alternatives to HSR. "The fossil fuel train sets 
-- the two -- remain in as an option, and we'll exercise 
that contingent on funding," she says.

  Not all TRB members are reassured by Clarke's pledge. 
George Haikalis, a New York City-based consultant, says the 
fossil fuel order now falls "at the end of the option, not 
at the end of the initial order. That puts it in jeopardy, 
puts it at risk.

  "The number of trains, whether 24 or 18, is fine, but they 
ought to all be fossil fuel, to get something up and running 
right now," Haikalis observers. "We're talking three million 
person hours of delay just to accomplish what we could 
accomplish sooner, at lower cost and less inconvenience."

  Haikalis says Amtrak is correct to focus its resources on 
one HSR project, rather than spread a limited pool of funds 
across the country, diluting any impact. But using the NEC 
for fossil-fuel R&D, he says, not only is better and more 
cost-effective, "but they'd be advancing a technology that 
would have widespread application throughout the U.S. in the 
'Accelerail' program."

  "Amtrak and FRA may want to be sacrificing this to reduce 
the credibility of alternatives to electrification," 
Haikalis charges. "Everything must be sacrificed on the 
altar of electrification."

  Amtrak rejects Haikalis's accusations. "If Mr. Haikalis is 
correct, why is 90 percent of Europe's highly acclaimed 
passenger rails system electrified?" says Amtrak director of 
media relations Clifford Black. "And why aren't they 
instituting fossil fuel replacements?"

  Adds Clarke, "Most of our trains are running on non-
electrified territory; we have every interest in developing 
a train that would be appropriate. We certainly haven't 
abandoned the fossil-fuel option," Clarke declares. "But in 
the entire nation, this [the NEC] is the market where we can 
truly dominate."

  Amtrak still may add to its order of 18 trains, Clarke 
points out. "We got approval from the Board to move forward 
with 18 train sets, but I don't think that means Amtrak 
won't obtain 19, 20, 21 sets or whatever."

  Efforts on Capitol Hill are still underway to secure a 
dedicated capital funding source for the railroad, though 
the proposal has been stymied by the budget debate. "If we 
get the half-penny gas tax, the number of equipment sets 
could change," says Black. "Regardless of our near-term 
capital situation, it can be assumed that a successful 18 
set order could be easily expanded, if warranted and if 
money is available."

  Black says the initial order of 18 sets will be sufficient 
to serve the entire NEC adequately, once electrification is 
extended from New Haven, Conn. to Boston. He also says the 
decision date for awarding a contract, which has slipped 
repeatedly through 1995 is now firm. "The Board will make 
its decision in February," Black says.

  "There continues to be give and take between Amtrak and 
the remaining vendors on various details of the contract, 
including but not limited to financing and servicing 
requirements. We concede that it has been a very long 
siege," Black says. "The process has proved more complicated 
than anticipated."

  NEC electrification, also repeatedly delayed, is now set 
to begin under a new contractor team headed by Balfour 
Beatty Power Construction, Inc. and Massachusetts Electric 
Construction Co. Amtrak had planned to hold a groundbreaking 
ceremony in early spring, with full construction underway by 
summer. "We're still planning a June 1996 groundbreaking 
with full mobilization at the same time. But I don't think 
we're planning a ceremonial groundbreaking."

AMTRAK DEFENDS 
DECISION TO DROP 
ABB TRACTION

  Partisans of X-2000 tilt train technology have protested 
Amtrak's decision last month to discontinue negotiations 
with ABB Traction, Inc., one of three finalists vying for 
Amtrak's NEC equipment order. Amtrak reportedly dropped ABB 
from consideration due to higher cost estimates.

  But Amtrak director of media relations Clifford Black says 
Amtrak's decision was not, in and of itself, a rejection of 
the X-2000. "We're frustrated in dealing with the continued 
belief, and myth, that this is somehow a competition between 
the X-2000, as we know it, the ICE train as we know it, and 
the TGV as we know it," Black says.

  Black notes "we have received letters from people 
protesting [dropping the X-2000] because those people 
thought it was an excellent train. We liked it too, and 
thought it was an excellent train." But Amtrak's 
specifications call for a distinct product tailored to U.S. 
needs. "We're not buying an off-the- shelf train."

  Some letters addressed to Amtrak suggest "we have cast off 
an American-made X-2000 and are now negotiating with German 
and Canadian companies. The irony is, regardless of who is 
awarded the contract, the provision calling for substantial 
American content remains the same," Black says.

  "This is not a vote of no-confidence for the X-2000. This 
is an Amtrak train designed to incorporate features and 
characteristics that we feel will best suit our needs."

DG VII SHIFTS FOCUS
FROM RAIL IN 2ND CALL,
BUT TASKS STRESS HSR  

  Rail research has moved right down the priority list for 
the second Fourth Framework call for proposals from DG VII 
at the European Commission (EC). The transport directorate 
in Brussels is looking to allocate around ECU4.5 million 
($5.7 million) to selected rail research bids due to be 
submitted by the March 15 deadline.

  The low figure this time round is partly due to the 
success of rail companies in bidding for funds on offer in 
the first call for proposals. Rail has been allocated 16 
percent of the program's overall budget of ECU256 million 
for projects running in the period 1995 through 1998 (see 
HST News, Jan. 23, 1995). But rail bids secured over two 
thirds of this allocation from the first round of bidding -- 
primarily thanks to the coordination of most of these by 
Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer (UIC) -- leaving 
just ECU13 million for rail projects in the second and third 
calls.

  Despite the low budget on offer, there are 30 tasks 
directly related to rail which are open for DG VII's second 
call for proposals, issued on Dec. 15 (see chart page 8). 
But while rail proposers are likely to have to fight over 
just ECU4.5 million, there are other sections of the program 
which should have some rail elements.

  The strategic research section of DG VII's program 
accounts for 20 percent of the overall budget. In the second 
call, this program section is in line for approximately 
ECU11.71 million; representing the largest share of the 
ECU48 million expected to be on offer.

  In addition, the program section covering integrated 
transport chains -- with a budget for this call of 
approximately ECU4.47 million -- also has a high rail 
content. All seven tasks in this section were open in the 
first call, but the transport directorate is still accepting 
bids on these during the second call for proposals.

  The transport chains section addresses primarily freight 
operations. It aims to improve freight facilities both on 
individual modes and in the interoperability between modes. 
The program section divides into tasks relating to transport 
terminals and networks. One of the main priorities 
identified in the work program relates to improved access 
for freight to rail infrastructure.

  DG VII approved 111 projects for funding from the first 
call for proposals (see HST News, Dec. 25, 1995). But, with 
some contracts not yet signed, officials from the transport 
directorate have not released details of these. The only 
exception is the integrated transport chains projects.

  Given that bids for the second call will have to make sure 
they do not overlap with those approved from the first, DG 
VII has released the list of the three projects already 
approved for funding in this section of the program, 
explains Simon Mordue, an official in the transport 
directorate. The current plan is to publish brief summaries 
of all projects -- assuming the contracts are signed -- in 
March, he adds.

  "One result of the first call was three projects on 
integrated transport chains," Mordue says. INRETS (Institut 
National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite) 
in Paris is leading the IQ (Intermodal quality) project. The 
consortium is planning four field trials which will aim to 
improve "operational and control functions within the 
network and the terminals," according to the additional 
information documents released by DG VII as part of the work 
program.

  The Impulse (Interoperable modular pilot plants underlying 
the logistics systems in Europe) project, led by the German 
firm Krupp Fordertechnik, will address "trans-shipment 
facilities and the related terminal organization." PLS 
Consult, based in Arhus, Denmark, is the coordinator of the 
Freia (Towards the networking of European freight villages) 
project which is concerned with the role of smaller firms in 
intermodal transport.

  Of the 30 tasks currently open in the rail section of the 
program, eight have an element of high speed rail. The task 
description included in the work program for Task 37 
stresses the need for interoperability of high speed rail 
systems. "When analyzing the cost benefits of inter- 
operability in order to find reasonable levels one must not 
only consider the short term views but also the longer term 
effects especially taking account of the fact that inter- 
operable advanced (telematics) technology is very cost 
effective," it states.

  Seven tasks under the title "future rail freight and 
passenger management" are included in the current call for 
proposals, all with reference to high speed rail. DG VII 
officials indicate that "all the tasks 44 to 50 could form 
one project or they could be split up on a few different 
projects."

  "With the construction of high speed rail lines the 
possible use of these lines also for freight services should 
be considered," says the work program, which has had some 
minor modifications since it was first issued in December 
1994, states.

  The set of tasks on "future" issues ends with a pragmatic 
assessment of the potential for high speed rail. The task 
"is intended to deal with finding the optimum solution in 
the area of compromise between speed, comfort and costs on 
lines which are not obvious candidates for dedicated high 
speed services," according to the work program.

  The majority of the 111 projects selected in the first 
wave of DG VII's new program have finally got down to work 
this month. Proposers hoping for a share of the second call 
budget can expect to have to start work in autumn, at which 
time DG VII is currently planning to release its third and 
final call for proposals in the Fourth Framework.

  DG VII has pushed its open information policy in setting 
up the new program -- its largest Framework R&D effort by 
far. As well as having sent out paper-based information 
packs to tens of thousands of prospective proposers over the 
last year, the directorate's information has been available 
electronically. Close to 5,000 sets of documents have been 
distributed in this way, Mordue says.

  Up to date information will soon be available via an on-
line service. "We're just finalizing a home page on the 
World Wide Web," Mordue says. Until this is established, 
further details on DG VII's Fourth Framework plans can be 
accessed through http://www.cordis.lu.

GIRDERS AND PROPULSION
CHANGES AS TRANSRAPID
PREPARES FOR MORE TESTS

  Officials from the Transrapid consortium are completing a 
series of upgrades to the high speed maglev facility in 
Emsland, Germany. One of the main changes concerns the 
propulsion system for the Transrapid. The "new generation" 
currently being installed should now stay the same through 
to installation on the Berlin-Hamburg line.

  Testing of the new propulsion system is scheduled to start 
in March or April, says Rudiger Fuerst, the project manager 
for Siemens AG Transportation Systems Group within 
Transrapid in Erlangen, Germany. The modifications have 
required "new inverters and new rectifiers. This is now the 
type we want to use in the project Berlin-Hamburg," he adds.

  To accommodate the synchronous motors required by the 
Transrapid, "we have to construct a special power supply," 
Fuerst explains. Since the system works by varying the 
current and the frequency, "we have to use inverters" which 
can change the frequency between zero and 270 Hz. "To use 
this inverter, we need rectifiers to convert" from the 50 Hz 
mains supply to DC.

  But it is not just the propulsion system which is being 
modified following the initial tests on the 31.5 km test 
track. "The test facility has been upgraded," notes Manfred 
Wackers, head of marketing and system applications at 
Transrapid International in Munich. Since the first phase of 
testing, "the system has been further improved," he adds.

  With prototype Transrapids being tested at speeds in 
excess of 400 km/h, there have been reports of wear and tear 
on some sections of the guideway. That is "right and wrong," 
Wackers observes. "We have different types of girders" 
holding up the guideway along the test track for evaluation 
purposes. It was planned from the outset that "not all of 
these would be used in construction," he adds.

  Officials from Transrapid -- a joint venture of ABB 
Daimler-Benz Transportation Systems, Siemens and Thyssen 
Henschel Maglev Transportation Technology (Magnetfahrtech- 
nik) -- have identified three girder types which could be of 
use on different sections of the Berlin-Hamburg route. These 
are constructed from "concrete, steel as well as a combined 
technology," Wackers says.

  While the new propulsion tests will not start for a few 
months, the Emsland track is currently being used to assess 
passenger comfort issues. Transrapids have been running on 
the track at speeds of up to 425 km/h with passengers on 
board, Wackers says. "Even those who are opposed to the 
system, they are convinced" once they have been on a test 
run, he claims.

  For the Berlin-Hamburg line, "construction will start in 
1998," as planned, says Wackers, originally from the Thyssen 
side of the Transrapid group. "The legal planning phases" 
are continuing, but "we are making progress," he notes. The 
intention is that this "will be accomplished by the middle 
of 1996."

  The whole consortium is involved in carrying out the 
necessary assessments, Fuerst says. These cover issues such 
as energy consumption, noise levels, and land requirements 
both for the track and for the power supply facilities.

  Some of the tests as part of this assessment have 
indicated that in a few situations Transrapid can meet noise 
regulations "without building a noise wall, even if the 
guideway is only a couple of meters away, at speeds of 200 
km/h," Wackers says. A more typical spacing may be closer to 
10 meters.

  The proposed route is "nearly 300 km in length, so you 
need three to four years in the planning process," Wackers 
notes. "Planning for Berlin-Hamburg is now in the detailed 
planning phase," he says. It has reached the stage where the 
local and national authorities are trying "to find the right 
locations for the stations in the cities. Different 
alternatives are being evaluated," he adds.

  The decision on whether the line will extend to the 
proposed new airport in Berlin has still to be finalized 
(see HST News, June 12, 1995). This is "an option," Wackers 
says. But the authorities still "don't know where the 
location [of the airport] might be." This should finally be 
sorted out some time later this year. The next stage in the 
planning process will aim to compile some "concrete cost 
findings into the economics of the whole project again," he 
says.

  While the main testing should be completed within the next 
year, the test track will not be closed down. "We think we 
will need this test facility until the project Berlin-
Hamburg works," Fuerst says. This is likely to be eight 
years from now.

  In addition to Siemens, Thyssen Henschel Magnetfahrtechnik 
and ABB, the Transrapid group also includes Dyckerhoff 
Widmann, Hochtief, Philipp Holzmann and Deutsche Bahn.

1995: NEW WORKS AND
R&D RISE IN EUROPE;
NORTH AMERICA FADES

  Squabbles over the formation of European Union (EU) often 
obscured the substantial ongoing progress within Europe's 
rapidly expanding high speed transport network. As 1995 
began, several HSR route additions were being constructed, 
more were being planned, most were assured of some funding 
support, and even one high speed commercial maglev project  
-- the world's first -- made substantial gains.

  Among Asian nations, South Korea looked to add two more 
HSR lines to supplement its initial route, while Malaysia 
worked to attract European equipment manufacturers. Japan 
intensified its efforts to market its well-tested Shinkansen 
HSR technology for export, and evaluated that technology's 
performance after a devastating earthquake shook Kobe Jan. 
17. West Japan Railways (WJR) service was disrupted, but WJR 
infrastructure held up better than nearby highway elevated 
construction and equipment damage was judged to be minor.

  Though no comparable earthquake jolted North America, both 
Canada and the United States fell further behind in HST 
development. Both Florida and Washington state advanced 
individual HSR programs to compensate for the lack of 
interest within the U.S. federal government. Canada's long-
delayed HSR study, finally released, suggested North 
America's largest nation would play no part at all in the 
HSR universe.

  Fiscal woes surrounding the Channel Tunnel's business 
operations all but overshadowed the steady presence of its 
everyday rail operations, including the rise of Eurostar HSR 
service as a dominant carrier between London and Paris. As 
the summer arrived, Le Shuttle tourist trains through the 
Chunnel also began attracting increased passenger loads, 
although Le Shuttle's on-time performance struggled to meet 
targeted projections.

  Eurostar's marketing success highlighted the triumph of 
one more TGV variant manufactured by HSR leader GEC Alsthom. 
But the Paris-based company faced some tough competition in 
1995, as more nations joined the HSR club, and many chose 
technology other than top-speed TGV designs.

  Early in the year, Norwegian State Railway (Norges 
Statsbaner) opted for 16 electric multiple-units (EMUs) 
modifications of ABB Traction, Inc.'s X-2000 tilt train. The 
order was the first equipment export success for Vasteras, 
Sweden-based ABB, though it dominates its own domestic 
market. (ABB's tentative dismissal by Amtrak later last year 
only increases the corporation's stake in the Norwegian 
order.)

  Siemens AG Transportation Systems Group, the Berlin-based 
maker of InterCity Express (ICE) equipment, also scored its 
first export sales triumph, and also through a neighboring 
country -- the Netherlands. Netherlands Railways 
(Nederlandse Spoorwegen) officials opted for six new Siemens 
ICE 2/2 lightweight HSR train sets to link Amsterdam with 
Frankfurt and Berlin.

  Savigliano, Italy-based Fiat Ferroviaria had its own 
export success, as Finnish State Railways (Valtiorautatiet) 
accepted two Pendolino S200 tilt train sets for that 
nation's first HSR route, a 150 km (94 mile) line between 
Helsinki and Turku. Valtiorautatiet initiated HSR service 
late in the year, following conventional service upgrades 
and HSR testing along the route.

  In a joint effort, both Siemens and Fiat Ferroviaria 
combined forces with two Czech firms to supply 10 HSR EMU 
train sets to Czech Railways (Ceske Drahy). The order 
bolstered Fiat's role as the dominant supplier of tilt train 
technology within Europe, and highlighted the Siemens/Fiat 
partnership being applied to other projects, including 
Amtrak's Northeast Corridor (NEC). The order also added the 
Czech Republic to the potential list of HSR nations, making 
the nation potentially the first former East Bloc country to 
join the European HSR club.

  Siemens' 1995 success was not limited to just HSR, as it 
and several other domestic firms continued to advance 
Germany's long-range plan for the world's first high speed 
commercial maglev service. Revised plans in 1995 added city 
center access to Berlin as part of the mix, with officials 
of Transrapid Planning Corporation GmbH scouting several 
through-city rights-of-way for use to and through the 
nation's capital. The extension of the original DM8.9 
billion ($6.3 billion), 283 kilometer (175 mile) route could 
open up better intermodal opportunities with Berlin's U-Bahn 
and S-Bahn services, as well as steel-wheel HST operations. 
Transrapid's current Hamburg-Berlin route has been 
criticized by industry observers for its inferior Berlin 
terminus at Westkreuz (West Cross) Station, which offers 
skeletal intermodal links.

  In midyear, officials from the state of Brandenburg added 
another proposal to the maglev project: a connection to a 
new international airport now being proposed for the city. 
Berlin city officials were skeptical of the proposal, which 
would recycle Sperenberg Air Base south of the city, 
recently closed at part of the withdrawal of the Soviet army 
following Germany's unification.

  The European Commission (EC), struggling to make itself 
effective, continued advancing two directorates in the 
transport field last year, with HSR high on the list of 
priorities. Estimates produced in Brussels last year point 
to a spend of ECU240 billion ($303 billion) for the 
infrastructure and rolling stock required to complete the 
high speed rail sections of the trans-European transport 
network. The EC's transport directorate (DG VII) has lined 
up ECU2.05 billion for the period 1993-1999, but there are 
other options through, for example, the European Investment 
Bank.

  On the research side, DG VII selected 111 projects for the 
first phase of its new ECU256 million program within the 
Fourth Framework. Overall, rail is expected to receive 16 
percent of this budget over the next four years, with the 
European Rail Transport Management System (ERTMS) high on 
the agenda. Also on the transport side, DG VII approved 
ECU240 million in 1995 to support the 14 priority transport 
projects, many of which concern high speed rail.

  Elsewhere at the Brussels administration, the telematics 
directorate (DG XIII) garnered less attention within the 
rail community. DG XIII targets more funding to roadways 
than rail, but several rail proposals survive, including the 
Railway Open System Interconnection Network (Rosin). 
Nonetheless, roads remain the dominant mode within DG XIII, 
according to former director generale Michel Carpentier.

  Amtrak ended 1995 just as it began it: preparing to order 
train sets to provide high speed rail service to its 
Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Washington, D.C. and 
Boston. Amtrak began 1995 hoping to select one of three 
competing consortia "in the spring." By year's end, the 
railroad had effectively eliminated ABB Traction, Inc. from 
the competition, but still had to choose between two 
consortia led by Siemens Transportation Systems and GEC 
Alsthom/Bombardier Corp., respectively. Amtrak's newest 
deadline for the decision is set for February, with industry 
observers becoming weary marking the delays.

  Meanwhile, leadership within the new Republican Congress 
gave Amtrak a two-pronged message: (1) do more with less; 
and (2) don't emphasize the NEC and HSR at the expense of 
other long-distance intercity services.

  Amtrak also marked time in extending electrification of 
the NEC north of New Haven, Conn. to Boston, in part due to 
the withdrawal of Morrison-Knudsen Corp. as the prime 
contractor for the project.

  Though Florida's Department of Transportation (FDOT) 
finally pulled the plug on the ill-fated Orlando maglev 
project in early January, FDOT moved aggressively to attract 
private sector interest for an HST network linking Miami, 
Orlando and Tampa. By year's end, five consortia -- three 
HSR entries and two maglev proposals -- were submitted to 
the state, seeking to tap FDOT's guarantee of $70 million in 
state funds available each year for the next 25 years.

  A more modest $40 million program in Washington State was 
advanced to establish incremental HSR between Portland, 
Ore., Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., using leased Talgo 
passive tilt train equipment. Washington DOT officials 
released their own request for proposals late in the year to 
lease/purchase two non-electric HSR trains, with Madrid-
based Patentes Talgo, S.A. given the edge in any 
competition.

  If the United States symbolized the downsizing of HSR 
ambitions in North America, Canada represented full-scale 
retreat. The Quebec/Windsor High Speed Rail feasibility 
study, begun in 1992, essentially declared HSR too expensive 
for the nation's needs, and thus unjustified to receive 
federal funds. But controversy surfaced when the 89-page 
study's conclusion, supported by the federal government, was 
disputed by the study's two other partners, particularly the 
province of Quebec.

  Critics also noted the feasibility study predictably 
endorsed TGV HSR service for the route, should the national 
will be found to finance it, and drew a link between the 
endorsement and the role of Canada's Bombardier, Inc. in 
marketing TGV technology for North America. ABB Traction, 
Inc. publicly questioned the study's dismissal of lower-
speed, tilt-technology trains for the route, noting Amtrak's 
NEC plans included tilt-train capabilities.

  North America's HSR travails were mirrored by those of 
associations like the High Speed Rail/Maglev Association 
(HSR/MLA), which tried to remain relevant in spite of 
dwindling federal financial and political support for high-
speed options. HSR/MLA president Joseph Vranich, credited 
with highlighting HST opportunities in the U.S., abruptly 
resigned from his position early in the year, leaving a 
leadership void for much of 1995 and an annual meeting held 
in Boston during the spring that sought to determine what 
the future held for both the organization and North American 
HST.

  By contrast, European HST interests, led by the European 
Commission (EC), the Union Inter- nationale des Chemins de 
Fer (UIC), and others, held the Eurailspeed Second World 
Congress on High-Speed Rail last fall, spotlighting the rise 
of Lille, France, as a high speed rail and intermodal 
transport hub. The attitude was upbeat, reflecting a growing 
belief that European nations, led by the EU, would expand 
HSR opportunities.

FRA SUMMARY FINDS
MAGLEV DISMISSED,
HSR PREFERRED

  The Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) High Speed 
Ground Transportation Policy Outreach summary, compiling 
public comment from eight public meetings held in 1995 
throughout the U.S., suggests that incremental improvements 
to passenger rail may be the best policy course, at least in 
the eyes of those who testified.

  Those testifying at the hearings, perhaps predictably, 
were generally in favor of high speed transport, whether HSR 
or maglev, as opposed to continuing existing federal 
priorities which appear to favor road or air. But only one 
of the eight meetings -- in Albany, N.Y. -- registered any 
substantial support for maglev development, according to the 
FRA findings.

  The 23 page (plus appendix) FRA report also touched on 
funding issues, HST as part of a National Highway System 
(NHS), the role of ISTEA in funding HSR, state funding 
options, and the role of Amtrak in any U.S. HST future.

  The HSGT Policy Outreach will be used in conjunction with 
FRA's ongoing Commercial Feasibility Study (CFS), both 
mandated by ISTEA, "to determine where and what types of 
High Speed Ground Transportation makes sense in the United 
States." The CFS study, originally due for submission to 
Congress last September, now is scheduled to be completed by 
this spring (see HST News, July 24, 1995).

  Besides Albany, N.Y., FRA held meetings in Richmond, Va., 
Portland, Ore., Sacramento, Calif., Orlando, Fla., Chicago 
and New Orleans. An eighth meeting was held in conjunction 
with the 12th annual meeting of the High Speed Rail/Maglev 
Association (HSR/MLA) in Boston.

  "While there were several references to 'real high speed 
rail' with speeds of greater than 150 miles per hour, most 
participants focused on the short-term goals of increasing 
speeds to 90, 110 and 125 miles per hour." the FRA report 
says.

  "Maglev was mentioned infrequently," it adds pointedly. 
"The New York State Department of Transportation reported 
that their 'long term goal is to evaluate the feasibility of 
offering very high speed service (up to 300 mph) using 
Maglev technology between major urban centers.' The Florida 
Department of Transportation is open to consideration of any 
HSGT technology, including Maglev, for the Miami-Orlando-
Tampa corridor. Other participants, however, expressed 
reservations about the feasibility of Maglev." FRA notes 
that in New York, the Empire State Passengers Association 
(ESPA), a citizens group, protested the high cost relative 
to the modest cost savings that maglev would offer over HSR 
in the state's Empire Corridor linking Buffalo, Albany and 
New York City.

  In Portland, Ore., one of ESPA's counterparts, the 
Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates, argued 
that "HSGT should be able to directly compete with NHS 
highways in the same corridor for the same Federal funds." 
The FRA report notes speakers from the Pacific Northwest 
enthusiastically supported HSR opportunities for the 
region's Cascadia Corridor, running from Portland through 
Seattle to Vancouver, B.C.

  ISTEA funding for HST was also advocated as a capital 
source. A statement by the National Association of Railroad 
Passengers (NARP) declared "the Federal government should 
provide the same opportunities for investment in high-speed 
(and conventional) rail as it does for aviation and 
highways."

  FRA briefly but crisply notes the "universal agreement 
that the Federal Government needs to take the lead in 
defining safety standards for HSGT and in developing the 
technology of other low cost alternatives to grade 
separation or crossing closures." FRA Administrator Jolene 
M. Molitoris has made safety a priority concern for the 
agency, and has focused on grade crossing safety as an 
essential component of her campaign.

  [In a speech before the Transportation Research Board in 
Washington, D.C. on Jan. 10, Transportation Secretary 
Federico F. Pena included rail grade crossing safety as the 
sole rail component of a nine point plan for Intelligent 
Transportation Infrastructure (ITI). The ITI plan would be 
included in the U.S. Department of Transportation's 
Operation TimeSaver, designed to speed travel in the 21st 
century. Pena cited the October bus/rail collision in Fox 
River Grove, Ill. as "a wake-up call on the importance of 
linking systems." Other rail issues, including HST, were not 
addressed by Pena in the speech, however.]

  Federal priority was also urged to override state and 
local regulations that, by chance or design, preclude HST 
development. FRA notes that even Amtrak's Northeast Corridor 
(NEC), an existing HSR route, has been blocked by opponents 
of electrification; the study says one speaker testified 
that "incentives should be offered to states for eliminating 
restrictive regulations and procedures that slow the 
implementation" of HST.

  Proponents of "gateway technologies," including non-
electric HSR development and positive train control (PTC) 
systems, were well represented at the various sessions. The 
FRA found "widespread support for efforts to develop a new 
non-electric locomotive, a positive train control system, 
and positive barriers for grade crossings. However, there is 
concern that FRA not reinvent existing European and Japanese 
technology in hope of establishing a US rail manufacturing 
industry. Many participants believe that effort to create a 
new industry could unduly delay the implementation of HSGT 
programs. Rather than develop new train set technology, 
participants urged the FRA to facilitate the importation of 
European technology through the establishment of standards 
that are compatible with the International Railway Union 
(UIC) standards."

  But FRA also noted, "Incremental improvements are being 
designed to benefit all potential users of the rail system" 
in each region where it held hearings. "Emphasis is also 
being placed on expanding the reach of the rail systems, by 
linking areas that could feed the high speed rail line. The 
goal behind these efforts, in all cases, is to create a 
stronger market for HSGT by improving the level of service 
currently being offered.

  "Success stories were cited in every region, demonstrating 
savings in travel time and other effects of improving train 
speeds, frequency, and reliability on ridership levels, as 
well as on public support for new rail systems," the summary 
said.

  * The decision on which of the two remaining bidders will 
be selected for the construction of the U.K. Channel tunnel 
rail link is anticipated within the next few days. Reports 
over the holiday period noted that the announcement by the 
U.K. Department of Transport (DOT) would be expected in 
early February. At press time, DOT officials noted that the 
announcement was expected "shortly."

  The construction plan has already been put back, however, 
with a completion date now set in the early part of 2003, 
six months later than scheduled. The route from London to 
the Channel Tunnel is 68 miles long. The two consortia, one 
of which will also take over the operation of Eurostar, are: 
London and Continental Railways, including Virgin, Ove Arup 
and Partners, SG Warburg and Bechtel; and Eurorail, with 
BICC, Trafalgar House HSBC and National Westminster Bank.

  Contracts should be signed on April 1, with many U.K. rail 
industry observers tipping London and Continental as the 
likely successful bid. But with Eurostar's patronage for 
1995 down more than 60 percent on predictions, that may not 
be the best part of the deal. Along with the contract, the 
successful consortium will secure considerable land, some of 
which could be used for potentially lucrative real estate 
redevelopment.

  * Neil Kinnock, the European transport commissioner, has 
set out his stall for European transport policy over the 
coming years with the publication of the green paper 
"Towards fair and efficient pricing in transport." The 
report concentrates on proposing methods to level the 
playing field between the costs associated with different 
transport modes, with particular reference to methods of 
charging motorists for roads at the point of use.

  "Measures should be taken to review policies to establish 
fairer competition between modes of transport," Kinnock says 
in the report's introduction. "Both rail and inland 
waterways appear to have much lower cost recovery rates than 
road haulage," the report states in setting out the case 
that road infrastructure costs are not being met. 

  Kinnock's green paper is part of the process the EC is 
going through in addressing the "internalization of external 
costs."

DOT TO PUSH ITS DEPLOYMENT
IN 75 LARGEST U.S. METRO AREAS

  Transportation Secretary Federico Pena announced a new 
initiative last week to build an "intelligent transportation 
infrastructure" (ITI) across the United States. "I want 75 
of our largest metropolitan areas outfitted with a complete 
intelligent transportation infrastructure in ten years," 
Pena said, echoing John Kennedy's call to put an American on 
the moon within a decade. Pena discussed the new ITS goal at 
the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board 
(TRB) last Wednesday.

  Pena was scheduled to unveil the new plan on Monday, but 
the blizzard that dumped on the mid-Atlantic forced him to 
postpone his address to the TRB. In the meantime, word of 
the new initiative, dubbed "Operation TimeSaver," had 
already started trickling out. The Associated Press carried 
an item about it on Monday, and National Public Radio 
mentioned it briefly on Tuesday, although neither report 
carried much detail.

  Pena said the goal of Operation TimeSaver is to reduce 
travel time in the U.S. by at least 15 percent. To achieve 
that aim, metropolitan areas will be encouraged to implement 
an infrastructure that integrates nine component systems 
for: traffic signal control; freeway management; transit 
management; incident management; electronic toll collection 
(ETC); electronic fare payment; warnings at railroad grade 
crossings; emergency response; and multimodal traveler 
information systems.

  "There isn't a community in the country that has all 
nine," Pena said. "Atlanta comes closest, as it prepares for 
the Olympics. Many cities have some components, but the 
components aren't linked."

  In connection with Operation TimeSaver, the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) expects later this month 
to open its solicitation for two or three metropolitan areas 
to serve as model deployment sites. Plans for the 
solicitation are not new. Officials with the federal ITS 
program have been talking about it for months, though lack 
of support from Congress has forced them to vastly reduce 
the scope of that program. (see Inside ITS, Nov. 6, 1995).

  It's clear that the DOT is not looking to Congress for the 
type of dedicated funding for Operation TimeSaver that it 
hoped to win for last year's attempt at a model deployment 
program, the Trailblazer Initiative. The DOT asked for $100 
million for Trailblazer; instead, it received $10 million to 
support model deployments at the two or three sites it 
expects to choose this year.

  "There are federal dollars to help pay for this strategic 
investment," Pena said of Operation TimeSaver in his speech 
at the TRB. But these funds will not consist of new monies 
devoted to ITS initiatives. Rather, ITS is moving into the 
mainstream. "The federal aid that states receive can be used 
to build 100 percent of the infrastructure," he said. Also, 
"we must be more creative by inviting the private sector to 
play a role."

  A major task ahead of proponents of the ITI will be to 
convince state and local officials, and the public at large, 
that there are long term benefits to purchasing an ITI with 
money they might otherwise spend on concrete and steel or 
pothole repair. To that end, the DOT has formed a 
partnership with a variety of organizations to help drum up 
grass roots support. The organizations include Public 
Technologies Inc. (PTI); Public Transit; the American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials 
(AASHTO); the National Association of Counties; ITS America; 
the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE); the International 
Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association (IBTTA); the Surface 
Transportation Policy Project; the American Trucking 
Associations (ATA); the Highway Users Federation; and the 
National League of Cities.

  Regional offices of the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) also are being recruited for this effort, and 
regional employees will undergo training so that they can 
act as "missionaries," for ITS technology in the words of 
one DOT official at the TRB meeting. On Jan. 23, FHWA 
offices throughout the country will hold an "open house" to 
help introduce the program to stakeholders.

  Speaking at a Monday session, William Jones, coordinator 
of the advanced public transit systems program at the ITS 
Joint Program Office, described Operation TimeSaver 
primarily as an outreach program to deliver the message on 
the local and regional levels that ITS technology is 
available and worthy of investment. One could speculate that 
local efforts might also have a second target: legislators 
in Washington. Last year, ITS proponents scrambled to 
convince Congress that ITS is neither "corporate welfare" 
nor "science fiction." As a new round of Congressional 
appropriations begins this spring, Operation TimeSaver could 
serve as an effort to change the language of the debate. 
Pena's speech, along with brochures and a video promoting 
the program at the TRB, focused on the human benefits of 
ITS. Instead of talking about radar systems, proponents are 
trying to push the discussions back in the direction of 
systems that, for example, give parents more time to spend 
with their children.

  Although state and local transportation officials will 
need to rely on their general highway funds to build the 
ITI, the U.S. DOT has set aside money for other efforts 
meant to encourage ITS deployment. Pena used his TRB address 
to announce the award of five contracts to standards-setting 
organizations "to begin fast tracking the development" of 
ITS standards. These are AASHTO, the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ITE, the American Society 
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE). The money will pay for technical 
support for standards-making activities (see Inside ITS, 
Sept. 25, 1995). Pena did not mention the value of the 
contracts.

  Pena also said the DOT will make "a significant 
investment" in training DOT field personnel to deal with ITS 
technologies. Without naming the size of the investment, he 
said it will be "on the order made when we built the 
Interstate system." The training effort will be aimed at 
"expanding their technical capacity so civil engineers can 
become electronic and communication experts."

SNOW RAINS ON TRB'S
75TH ANNUAL MEETING
IN BLIZZARD-BOUND D.C.

  The Blizzard of '96 proved to be a spoiler for the 75th 
annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in 
Washington, D.C. last week. Over 17 inches of snow and winds 
gusting up to 35 mph closed airports, roads and above-ground 
sections of the Metro. After attendance last year of about 
7,100 people and pre-registration this year of 5,000, the 
TRB was expecting a banner year. But at the end of the first 
full day of the meeting, only 2,733 intrepid souls had been 
able to get to the event.

  Rodney Slater, head of the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA), drove a four wheel drive vehicle through the drifts 
to help deliver an annual report on ITS on Monday morning. 
Hundreds of people attended this session last year; just 
over 50 people, looking lost in a cavernous ballroom, took 
seats this year.

  But the administrator drew positive parallels with the 
first meeting, 75 years ago, of what eventually became the 
TRB. About the same number of people attended that first 
meeting, which also was held in a blizzard. Drawing a 
parallel with ITS, he said the TRB started with just a few 
people and a big idea, and it has blossomed into something 
grand.

  While Slater was talking about pathways to the future, 
Christine Johnson, the director of the ITS Joint Program 
Office (JPO) at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), 
was doing some back-breaking path work of her own -- 
shoveling her way out of her home for five and a half hours. 
"We could have used an intelligent transportation system 
here!" she said.

  Once the blizzard hit, getting into Washington was as 
difficult for residents of nearby suburbs as for delegates 
from overseas. Early in a Monday afternoon session on 
international developments in ITS, 40 people listened to two 
speakers in the same large ballroom used for the morning's 
domestic ITS report. Six presenters and a moderator had been 
scheduled. At many sessions, the presenters who showed up 
actually were pinch-hitters. Speakers introduced both 
themselves and "who they were supposed to be." At a meeting 
of the TRB's committee on ITS on Monday evening, 26 people 
were in attendance. Jim Scott, the TRB's staff person for 
the committee, said this meeting typically draws 200-250 
people.

  Foot traffic to the exhibit hall in the Sheraton 
Washington had to be diverted because two skylights had 
broken over the main entrance to the hall. Unfortunately, 
not many visitors were able to stroll through a special "ITS 
Pavilion" festooned with banners promoting "Operation 
TimeSaver" (see story on page 1) or exhibits devoted to 
federal and state departments of transportation. Those who 
took the alternate route to the exhibit hall could relax and 
monitor outside highway conditions through feeds from the 
Montgomery County, Md. advanced transportation management 
system (ATMS). Watching the video images of roadways was 
like watching fish in an aquarium on cable TV. Highways that 
are usually filled bumper-to-bumper with cars were serenely 
empty. An occasional vehicle would slowly float across the 
screen as a gentle snow continued to fall over the 
Washington area.

  But the task of trekking among meeting venues at the 
meeting was not serene. The TRB meeting took place in three 
hotels -- the Sheraton, the Omni Shoreham and the Washington 
Hilton -- that were to be connected by a shuttle service. 
The shuttle did not run on Monday; signs posted that evening 
said the service would "resume" on the second day. The buses 
began operating Tuesday morning, but as a fresh snowfall 
made the streets even more slippery, the shuttle service was 
abandoned by midday. That left transportation choices of 
taxis, which had doubled their rates and could get stuck; 
the Metro, which was "experiencing delays"; or bundling up 
and going by foot -- usually a wet foot.

  Amidst the adversity, perhaps not surprisingly, spirits 
seemed high among the attendees. Robert Jaffe, who works for 
the Loral Federal Systems team on the national ITS 
architecture, began one session by recounting how a group of 
people waiting for an elevator in a Metro station where the 
escalator was broken learned that most of them were headed 
for the TRB meeting. The group "decided it was an object 
lesson in transportation," he said. But, he added, "I'm not 
exactly sure what the object was."

  Despite the small audiences at many presentations, it was 
possible to see the future flowing into the hall at a 
session called "Information Superhighway: Transportation 
Applications of the World Wide Web and the Emerging National 
Information Infrastructure." Over 140 people squeezed into a 
small conference room, extending through the doorway and 
lining up two deep in the hall to hear this presentation. 
One of the things they learned is that a home page 
dispensing information on travel in Seattle is receiving 
11,000 hits a day. If the home page had been for Washington, 
D.C., the message last week would have been, "Stay home."

NEW OPEN PROTOCOL
DEMONSTRATED FOR
ITS COMMUNICATIONS

  A new protocol in the public domain that allows data 
communications among different types of traffic management 
devices from different manufacturers made its public debut 
at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board 
(TRB) last week. Called the National Transportation 
Communications ITS Protocol (NTCIP), it is "the backbone of 
ITS" and will enable its widespread deployment, says Alberto 
Santiago, chief of the Traffic Systems Branch at the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA). 

  One of the first states to lay the groundwork for that 
deployment will be California. The state has passed a law 
that makes conformance with the NTCIP mandatory for any 
traffic control systems sold there after the first of this 
year.

  People involved in the effort to develop the NTCIP are not 
cautious in assessing its value. It is "probably one of the 
most significant events in 20 years in transportation 
history," says Kenneth Vaughn, task manager for the NTCIP 
effort at PB Farradyne of Rockville, Md., which served as 
systems integrator in the final push to create the standard. 
The FHWA and the National Electrical Manufacturers 
Association (NEMA) have been working cooperatively on an 
open standard for several years. Last year, in an effort to 
accelerate the process, an NTCIP steering group was formed, 
composed of government agencies, systems integrators and 
consultants.

  The work began originally as an effort to develop an open 
standard for communication between different traffic signal 
controllers and traffic management centers (TMCs). But a 
broader vision of possibilities developed. The NTCIP now 
will work "like an Internet to communication devices in the 
field," says Don McWilliams, senior systems analyst at PB 
Farradyne. Besides traffic signal controllers, potential 
devices that the NTCIP will support include variable message 
signs (VMS), controls for video surveillance systems, ramp 
meters, highway advisory radio (HAR) systems, automatic 
vehicle identification (AVI) readers, environmental or 
weather sensors and other vehicle detection systems. Traffic 
management centers can also use it to communicate with one 
another. The work is resulting in "a suite of protocols 
rather than just one protocol," says Vaughn.

  The NTCIP protocol is based on International Standards 
Organization/Open Systems Interconnect (ISO/OSI) procedures. 
It uses existing standards and technology, works with high-
speed and low-speed communications links and supports legacy 
systems.

  The NTCIP will be one of many protocols to come under the 
umbrella of the national ITS system architecture. In one 
session on ITS at the TRB, agencies were urged to include 
the NTCIP in their specifications when they purchase 
equipment. The advice came from Robert Jaffe of the Loral 
Federal Systems team that is working on the national 
architecture. The keys to successful implementation of the 
ITS architecture are "open systems, open systems, open 
systems," he said.

  A new catch phrase that appeared on the lips of many ITS 
officials at this year's TRB is "buy smart." Proponents of 
the NTCIP say that to purchase systems that use the new 
protocol is to buy smart, because it they will prove cost 
effective in the long run.

  The NTCIP steering group is actively soliciting 
suggestions on how to spread the NTCIP gospel to local 
engineers and decision-makers. At the TRB they passed out 
"Surf'n NTCIP" buttons that displayed the address of the 
NTCIP World Wide Web home page: http://www.atms.volpe. 
dot.gov/ntcip/. They also distributed questionnaires asking 
if people had heard of the NTCIP and if they would 
participate in further work on it, plus a "reality check" 
question: "Would you use the protocol as it currently stands 
in a new system? If not, specify why not." Further 
information on the protocol can be obtained by faxing a 
request to Santiago at 703-285-2264.

  As pressure to deploy ITS systems has built up, so has the 
work on the NCTIP. Participants referred to the "lightning 
speed" at which it was finally put together. A year ago 
there was not even a good draft specification, says 
Santiago. PB Farradyne did not charge any fee for work 
specifically on the NTCIP, says Vaughn. The firm is working 
with the FHWA, under a contract worth about $5 million, on 
the development of real time traffic adaptive control 
systems (RT-TRACS). The NTCIP is integral to this work. If 
an additional contract for the NTCIP had been necessary, 
this could have delayed the standard for about a year and a 
half.

  A demonstration of the new protocol at the TRB went from 
idea to reality in four months, Vaughn says. For the 
demonstration, eight different signal controllers and three 
VMS from different manufacturers were linked to one computer 
over one telephone line. Another computer was linked to the 
first computer to show the ability of TMCs to talk to one 
another. Small colored lights representing traffic signals 
on a miniature roadway cycled through green, yellow and red 
either simultaneously or sequentially, depending on how they 
were programmed.

  The first three standards of the NTCIP are currently under 
legal review at NEMA. The FHWA expects to stage field 
demonstrations this summer at various locations. What is 
called the Caltrans version of the NTCIP -- which is already 
mandated -- is now, and will continue to be, in conformity 
with the NTCIP, says McWilliams.

  The NTCIP steering group consists of: the FHWA; the I-95 
Corridor Coalition; the California Department of 
Transportation (Caltrans); the states of Florida and 
Washington; the City of Los Angeles; the Texas 
Transportation Institute; Rockwell/Allen-Bradley Co.; 
Barton-Aschman Associates; DKS Associates; Intersection 
Development Corp.; Loral Federal Systems; and PB Farradyne. 
Other participants include ANSTEC, ARINC, Oak Ridge National 
Laboratories, and Opus One.

  Organizations planning to deploy the NTCIP include the 
public agencies on the steering group and Irvine, Calif.; La 
Mesa, Calif.; Las Vegas Area Computer Traffic System; 
Richardson, Texas; Santa Clara, Calif.; and Dade County, 
Fla., according to a Department of Transportation handout.

RAYTHEON PROMOTES
STAMP-SIZED RF TAG
FOR ITS APPLICATIONS

  Raytheon Co. in Tewksbury, Mass. is touting a new 35 GHz 
radio frequency (RF) tag the size of a postage stamp that 
can be read by a standard police radar gun. The tag can be 
used in applications involving electronic toll collection 
(ETC), smart parking, smart license plates, automobile 
identification and vehicle registration, the company says.

  In mass production, its cost would be competitive with 
other RF tags, says William McDonald, manager of ITS 
Programs at Raytheon. It's "fair to say that the retail cost 
of the tag would be less than $20," he says. The 35 GHz tag 
comes in two versions. A passive, read-only tag without a 
battery is the one that is the size of a postage stamp. An 
active tag with a battery is a little smaller than a half 
dollar. The communications range of the active tag is more 
than 1,000 feet, depending on where it is placed and on the 
weather, McDonald says.

  A police radar gun would have to be modified to include a 
small flat panel display to convey the information it 
receives from the tag. But since that part of the technology 
is available more or less off the shelf, it would help keep 
the cost of systems integration and deployment low, McDonald 
says. The technology for the system was developed by 
Raytheon's E-Systems Group under government contract. E-
Systems was acquired by Raytheon in the spring of last year.

  "It will be interesting to see if they can penetrate the 
electronic toll market," says Don Davis, associate program 
leader for transportation at the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, who has done extensive work on automatic vehicle 
identification (AVI) standards at the state and local 
levels. No standard currently exists for ETC, but many of 
the big players, both users and manufacturers, have made 
some choices, he says. In North America, nearly all 
electronic toll collection (ETC) systems use technology 
licensed at 915 MHz; in Europe most systems operate at 5.8 
GHz.

  "At this point in time I think it may be more confusing 
than anything to add yet another option to the menu," says 
Davis. McDonald says he hopes future architectural standards 
will permit a higher frequency range than what is envisioned 
at this point. The situation is fluid and options are 
flexible, he says.

  Unlike transmissions at lower frequencies, transmissions 
at 35 GHz are highly directional and make it possible to 
reduce cross-talk interference between lanes, says McDonald. 
The high frequency also provides a much higher rate of data 
exchange than tags currently used, he says.

  At the top of the microwave or Ka band, where the 35 GHz 
band is located, there are few existing applications, 
reducing the chance of interference, McDonald says. The 902-
928 MHz band, where North American AVI systems generally 
reside, is also used by other services, creating the 
potential for in-band interference. McDonald says he is not 
sure if commercial applications in the 35 GHz range require 
licensing but Raytheon "frequency people" are looking into 
that now.

  The tag could prove appealing to auto manufacturers 
because it is small enough to be placed almost anywhere on 
the vehicle for different uses, he says. "I believe that 
there are a number of car companies at this moment that are 
investigating the use of RF tags for industry use." Tags 
could assist car makers in the assembly process and could 
allow the electronic retrieval of data when a vehicle comes 
in for servicing, he says.

  Communications at higher frequencies could also find their 
way into automobiles through intelligent cruise control 
(ICC) systems, says McDonald. Within a few years, devices 
operating above 60 GHz will be produced and placed in cars 
in production volumes, he says. Another large potential 
market for high frequency tags is in applications involving 
license plates and vehicle registrations. If the tag is 
encrypted with a vehicle identification number (VIN) and the 
owner's ID, police could get an automatic read on the 
vehicle under zero light conditions, he says.

  All of these non-ETC applications could possibly have an 
effect on ETC standards. If a major car manufacturer rolled 
out a significant number of cars with factory-installed 
tags, that could in effect set a standard for future "smart 
cars" and electronic toll payment technology.

  "The industry has seen a lot of wild claims in the past. I 
wonder how real their product is," says Davis. But Raytheon 
has a track record of delivering components of radar 
technology. It has been involved in transponder technology 
for over two decades, McDonald says. It currently makes both 
silicon chips, used in 915 MHz systems, and gallium arsenate 
(GaAs) chips, used in higher frequency systems. Applications 
for its GaAs chips include high frequency intelligent cruise 
control (ICC) for a number of automotive tier one 
manufacturers, he says.

  The Raytheon chip used in the 35 GHz tag has been 
patented. McDonald says he is not permitted to discuss the 
internal technology, which he says is "compatible with 
industry manufacturing techniques."

CONGESTION PRICING
MAKES ITS DEBUT
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

  Congestion pricing -- enabled by ITS -- gained a toehold 
last month in southern California with the opening of the 
privately-owned SR 91 Express Lanes. In fact, that section 
of California currently is the only part of North America 
where congestion pricing projects are emerging from the 
planning stage. Public outcry recently halted an ambitious 
collection of congestion pricing programs in the state of 
Washington (see Inside ITS, Aug. 14, 1995). But in addition 
to the new commercial roadway in Orange County, a variably-
priced "HOV buy-in" project in San Diego is moving toward 
initial implementation this spring.

  The SR 91 Express Lanes, developed by the California 
Private Transportation Company (CPTC) in the median strip of 
state-owned SR 91, opened for business Dec. 27. The ten mile 
road is the first in the world to collect tolls entirely 
through electronic means. MFS Network Technologies in Omaha, 
Neb. supplies the electronic toll collection (ETC) system, 
with automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technology 
supplied by Texas Instruments in Attleboro, Mass.

  Patrons pay a variable toll, ranging from 25 cents to 
$2.50, to travel the Express Lanes. The toll varies 
according to a fixed schedule, so that the highest fee 
applies during peak travel periods and the lowest during 
hours when traffic is lightest. Vehicles with three or more 
occupants may use the lanes free of charge at all hours, 
though they must have transponders to validate their status. 
Drivers who do not wish to pay, or who do not have 
transponders, remain on the parallel freeway.

  CPTC is not disclosing either the number of transponders 
it is distributing or the volume of traffic the Express 
Lanes have seen so far -- a privilege it is allowed because 
it is not a public entity. The firm is "very pleased" with 
the response it has received from the public so far, says 
Greg Hulsizer, general manager at CPTC in Anaheim Hills, 
Calif. "We're literally working 'round the clock to fulfill 
all the orders, all the applications for transponders," he 
says, adding that traffic volume on the road has been 
building since the day it opened.

  As CPTC officials expected, the road is used most heavily 
during peak travel hours -- the westbound lanes in the 
morning and the eastbound lanes in the evening, Hulsizer 
says. This is in spite of the fact that the toll is highest 
at those times.

  Patrons who establish toll accounts with credit cards pay 
no deposit for their transponders but must put at least $40 
into a pre-paid toll account. Patrons who use cash or check 
must pay a $30 deposit and start their toll accounts with at 
least $50.

  CPTC officials at one point in their planning had talked 
about using actual traffic levels, as determined by traffic 
surveillance systems, to determine tolls. Under this system, 
the cost of using the lanes at the same hour on Thursday and 
Friday, for example, could have been different if actual 
traffic volumes were different.

  "We do have the capability to do that," Hulsizer says. But 
market research showed that customers "prefer some 
stability," he says. "They would prefer to know what the 
toll is when they wake up in the morning, and when they 
leave work. And so at least for the time being, we've 
decided to try and stick to our schedule."

  A little to the south of Orange County, however, real time 
traffic conditions eventually will determine what drivers of 
single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) pay for the privilege of 
using a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane under San Diego's 
planned buy-in program. The price will begin at $2.60 and 
rise as demand increases. "It's going to be run by the 
computer, and it's going to go as high as it needs to go to 
maintain a level of service B," says John Duve, project 
manager, advanced transportation at the San Diego 
Association of Governments (SANDAG).

  A consortium led by SANDAG is conducting the three year 
buy-in project under the federal Congestion Pricing Pilot 
Program, run by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). 
The federal agency is contributing 80 percent of the cost of 
the $16.1 million project, which focuses on an 8.5 mile, two 
lane reversible HOV lane in northeastern San Diego (see 
Inside IVHS, April 10, 1995).

  Participants had hoped to start operating an interim 
version of the system in the fall, but the target is now 
this spring. Among other things, the need to comply with 
regulations springing from an "executive order on 
environmental justice" has delayed the six month planning 
process, Duve says.

  The interim system will operate for six months to a year 
while participants are installing an electronic toll 
collection system. Under the interim system, variable fees 
will not be in effect. Rather, motorists will pay $100 per 
month for a transponder that will allow them to use the HOV 
lane. California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers will use 
portable readers to interrogate the transponders for 
information indicating whether the motorist's account is up 
to date. Single occupancy vehicles with unpaid accounts, or 
without transponders, will be pulled over.

  Participants still have not chosen a vendor to supply the 
ETC system. The California Department of Transportation 
(Caltrans) is responsible for that part of the project, Duve 
says. It's still not clear if the state agency will treat 
the HOV project as an extension to its contract with MFS 
Network Technologies to supply ETC for toll bridges in the 
state, or if it will open a new procurement, he says. Any 
system chosen would have to conform to the Caltrans 
specifications for non-stop ETC.

  It's also not clear yet how many transponders the project 
will require at the outset, but the number is likely to be 
small -- probably 3,000-5,000, Duve says. This is based on 
an estimate of 1,000 cars per hour paying to use the lanes 
during a three hour period when the HOV lane is open. Unlike 
most toll authorities, which distribute transponders through 
special customer service facilities, officials with the San 
Diego project plan to distribute tags through electronics 
retailers such as Radio Shack and Circuit City, he says.

VOICE-BASED SYSTEM
FOR ROUTE GUIDANCE
REACHES THE MARKET

  Two years after it announced it had developed a voice-
based route guidance system, Amerigon in Monrovia, Calif. 
has started shipping production units. Four manufacturers of 
audio compact disc players -- Alpine, Clarion, Eclipse and 
Kenwood -- are selling the "Interactive Voice System" (IVS) 
under their own labels.

  The IVS provides route guidance without the use of a 
vehicle location system. Instead, the user tells the system 
the location of the trip's starting point as well as the 
destination. Once the system generates a route, it provides 
a list of driving instructions, offering them one at a time, 
as prompted by the user. In addition to giving directions to 
addresses the user specifies, it can locate and direct him 
to restaurants, hotels, cash machines, tourist attractions 
and other points of interest stored in its database.

  The system does not include a screen or a set of buttons. 
Instead, it uses a voice recognition system to accept 
commands from the user, and voice output to provide 
directions, prompts and other messages. Amerigon claims the 
system can understand the full range of North American 
dialects and accents.

  Map databases and other software are stored on CDs. To 
operate, the IVS must be connected to a compatible car 
stereo CD system.

  Amerigon's product has undergone several changes since the 
company displayed a prototype at the Consumer Electronics 
Show (CES) in Las Vegas two years ago (see Inside IVHS, Jan. 
31, 1994). The company has abandoned its earlier name for 
the system, AudioNav, in favor of IVS. Each of the CD player 
manufacturers has given the product its own name, but the 
term IVS also appears on their packaging and in the 
software. The term is used to describe the product category; 
"it's sort of like VHS or GPS," says Paula Finnegan, 
Amerigon's sales and marketing manager for navigation 
systems.

  More significantly, the production unit relies on a 
different navigation database than the prototype. Amerigon 
has displayed versions of the system using data from Etak in 
Menlo Park, Calif., and the prototype system has been 
displayed in Etak's booth at trade shows such as the 
exposition at ITS America's annual meeting.

  The unit Amerigon currently is shipping, however, uses 
data from Navigation Technologies (NavTech) in Sunnyvale, 
Calif. Finnegan declines to explain the reason for the 
change. "We have license agreements with both and are still 
working with both," she says. The company could employ data 
from either firm, or both, in the future, she adds.

  Etak's understanding is that "Amerigon has always intended 
to use NavTech for their introductory product, and us for 
later products," says Pamela Crowley, an Etak spokesperson. 
Crowley speculates that when Amerigon decided on this 
course, probably two years ago, "at that point probably 
NavTech had better turn-by-turn data than we did." She would 
not draw direct comparisons between the quality of the turn-
by-turn navigation data available today from the two 
competing firms.

  Other changes include improvements to the speech 
recognition system, provided by Lernout and Hauspie Speech 
Products of Belgium, and the addition of non-volatile random 
access memory (RAM). The latter allows the system to store 
the vehicle's location (as indicated by the driver) when the 
car is shut off. Upon returning to the car, if the user 
immediately wants directions, the system will already know 
its starting point.

  The non-volatile RAM also allows the system to store up to 
ten frequently-used landmarks -- "like a speed dial 
feature," Finnegan says. The stored locations can be used as 
either starting points or destinations. To indicate a stored 
location the user says, for example, "number one," rather 
than following the usual procedure, which is to spell out 
the location letter by letter.

  The four manufacturers are selling the IVS for prices in 
the $600-$700 range. But unless the user already has a 
compatible CD player installed, the real cost of using IVS 
also includes the price tag for the audio system. Kenwood is 
selling the IVS and a CD player in a package as well as 
selling them separately; the other three treat the IVS only 
as a separate product, Finnegan says. Pricing varies among 
the manufacturers and depends on the features of the CD 
system, but the total cost of an IVS and a compatible CD 
player begins at about $1,000, she says.

  The IVS as sold by Kenwood and Eclipse can be linked to 
in-dash CD players manufactured by those companies, 
including systems the user may already have installed. The 
units sold by Alpine and Clarion connect to CD changers that 
are installed as add-ons to a car's existing stereo system. 
Customers buying the system from those companies must buy 
both the IVS and the changer, Finnegan says. Clarion 
customers also have the option of buying a "CD changer 
controller" to link the IVS to a previously-installed CD 
changer and in-dash stereo, she says.

  Whatever price the user pays for the hardware, it does not 
include access to the map databases. The IVS comes with a 
package of CDs containing data for all the metropolitan 
areas currently available. The customer, however, must call 
a toll free number to obtain an 11 digit pass code which 
activates the software. Amerigon charges $80 to activate one 
metropolitan area. Customers who activate more than one 
metro at once receive a ten percent discount on the second 
and subsequent databases.

  Amerigon chose to give away the discs but charge for 
activation, rather than simply sell the discs, largely for 
three reasons, Finnegan says. The first is that this saves 
the company money by allowing it to pack data for several 
metro areas on one disc. The metro database Amerigon uses 
requires less disc space than the corresponding database 
used in a screen-based navigation system because Amerigon 
doesn't need the code necessary to draw maps on screen.

  The second reason has to do with security, Finnegan says. 
The pass code a user obtains is keyed to a particular 
hardware unit. The customer cannot use the disc in a system 
installed in another car. The third reason is that this 
distribution method doesn't require retailers to stock discs 
for all available metro areas as a separate product line, 
she says.

  Databases currently available are: New York/New Jersey; 
Washington D.C./Baltimore; Los Angeles/Orange counties; Los 
Angeles five county extended coverage; San Francisco; San 
Diego; Las Vegas; Chicago; Detroit; and Indianapolis. 
Amerigon says ten additional databases will be available 
this spring. Material NavTech distributed at the ITS World 
Congress in Yokohama, Japan this fall indicates the company 
also has finished mapping Seattle/Tacoma; Sacramento; Santa 
Barbara, Calif.; San Bernadino and Riverside counties, 
Calif.; Phoenix; Denver/Boulder; Houston; Dallas/Fort Worth; 
Atlanta; Miami; Grand Rapids, Mich; and Philadelphia. It 
expects to complete Albuquerque, Austin/San Antonio, 
Minneapolis/St. Paul and Tampa/St. Petersburg this year.

  As new databases become available, Amerigon will market 
them directly to existing customers, Finnegan says. The 
company also will offer annual updates to the databases; 
pricing for those has not been determined, she says.

  Although the system's main function is to help drivers 
navigate, Amerigon had its eye on something more when it 
changed the product's name from AudioNav. "We're calling it 
IVS, Interactive Voice System, and getting away from just 
pure navigation, because there is the possibility of 
additional software titles in the future," Finnegan says. 
These might include guided tours, educational materials and 
children's games, all conducted through voice interaction. 
At the Winter CES in Las Vegas earlier this month, Amerigon 
demonstrated a voice-based game of blackjack "as a proof of 
concept," she says.

FUNDING EMERGENCIES,
NEED FOR INNOVATION
CHALLENGED ITS IN '95

  Last year was marked by both ITS funding crises and 
innovative attempts to fund ITS projects. Even as the 
Clinton Administration called for big cuts in spending on 
highways and other transportation infrastructure, the 
President began 1995 by asking the new Congress for close to 
$356 million for ITS programs in fiscal year 1996 -- $66.5 
million more than he requested the previous year.

  Of the new request, $100 million was for a new initiative 
called Trailblazer, which would fund model deployments of 
integrated suites of ITS technology for traffic management 
and travel information. Trailblazer was to be the first 
major foray beyond ITS research, testing and planning into 
the realm of real deployment. Besides this request for a new 
program, the budget was also complicated by the fact that 
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a 
reorganization that would consolidate 10 agencies into three 
and restructure its funding mechanisms.

  With budget hearings still in progress, ITS proponents 
were alarmed to learn that the House version of last 
spring's balanced budget resolution called for eliminating 
the federal ITS program entirely. The Senate version of the 
resolution did not mention ITS, but the program took a hit 
over the summer when Clinton signed into law a compromise 
version of a rescission bill that took back, among other 
things, $40.03 million in FY95 funds that the ITS program 
had not yet spent.

  In the transportation appropriation for FY96, the ITS 
program came out with $222.78 million, showing that Congress 
wished to see the program survive, even though it declined 
to expand its funding. Trailblazer received no funding, but 
Congress set aside $10 million to fund operational tests 
whose focus would coincide with the objectives of that 
initiative.

   The tough fight for funding in 1995 could be just a 
prelude to more of the same in 1996. "At this juncture, the 
jury is still out on the question of whether the program is 
a sound investment of federal dollars. Some projects appear 
to be yielding useful results; others are floundering," says 
a report on the federal ITS program released by the U.S. 
Congressional Budget Office at the end of the year.

  As a high-ticket effort that involves years of development 
and a new mode of transportation, the automated highway 
system (AHS) program made an easy target for critics who 
spoke of ITS as "science fiction." The program did obtain 
funding, although at a reduced level, which will extend the 
number of years the effort requires. In November, a year 
after it was selected to lead this effort, the National 
Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC) achieved its 
first milestone when it delivered a systems objectives and 
characteristics document. Another long-term effort of the 
DOT, to define a national ITS architecture, moved into its 
second phase when teams led by Rockwell International and 
Loral Federal Systems were chosen from a field of four 
competitors to work cooperatively with the DOT.

  The DOT selected only four ITS operational tests for 
funding in 1995, down from 17 the previous year. The smaller 
scope reflected both the tighter funding situation and the 
DOT's assertion that it is time to move beyond testing and 
focus on deployment. Anticipating higher volumes of 
international traffic due to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), two of the tests picked in 1995 will 
examine automated border crossing systems for commercial 
vehicle operations (CVO) in California and Arizona.

  A much anticipated CVO test focused on Interstate 75 in 
the U.S. and Highway 401 in Canada officially began its two-
year test period late in the year. Advantage I-75 is testing 
the use of weigh-in-motion (WIM) and vehicle-to-roadside 
communications (VRC) technologies to allow pre-cleared 
commercial vehicles to bypass weigh stations.

  Another operational test was scaled back dramatically in 
1995. The Chicagoland Advanced Driver and Vehicle Advisory 
Navigation Concept (Advance) project, once touted as the 
world's largest ITS operational test, slashed the size of 
its route guidance test from 3,000 to 75 units. Among the 
reasons given by officials was the need to show results and 
the slow development of markets for route guidance systems.

  Cost was a factor in the decision by Greyhound Bus lines 
to remove the radar-based collision warning system it 
purchased from Vorad Safety Systems in 1992. The reported 
success of the system -- that accident rates decreased over 
20 percent in the year after the system was installed -- had 
become a staple of speeches in support of ITS. But Greyhound 
officials said the benefits gained from the technology 
didn't outweigh the cost of keeping them running. Eaton 
Vorad, the Cleveland-based company formed when Vorad joined 
forces with Eaton Corp. in 1993, scored a success last year, 
nevertheless. Freightliner in Portland, Ore. began offering 
the firm's collision warning system as an option on a new 
model truck it introduced this year. Freightliner became the 
first truck manufacturer to offer such a system on a new 
vehicle.

  The past year also saw several efforts to develop 
innovative funding arrangements for transportation projects 
in the U.S. The privately-financed SR 91 Express Lanes 
opened in southern California in December (see story on page 
8). In the Puget Sound region of Washington, the idea of 
congestion pricing has not taken on as well. Public outcry 
put a stop to a cluster of transportation improvements that 
were to be financed through congestion pricing mechanisms, 
using electronic toll collection (ETC) technology to collect 
revenues.

  On the East Coast, the Dulles Greenway, the first 
privately-owned toll road in the U.S. this century, was 
completed in September, six months ahead of schedule. So 
far, however, traffic on the road, which uses an ETC system, 
has been reported far below expectations. The adjoining 
Dulles Toll Road, operated by the Virginia Department of 
Transportation (VDOT), continued its rocky path toward the 
development of its own ETC system, an effort it has had in 
progress since 1990. Last year's events included the 
purchase and delivery of ETC hardware from Combitech Traffic 
Systems in Sweden, which VDOT ultimately decided not to use, 
and the firing of its prime contractor, Cubic Toll Systems. 
Late in the year, Syntonic Technology was appointed the new 
prime contractor.

  Helping to clarify some issues related to standards, the 
Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) issued a long-
awaited ruling on location and monitoring services in the 
902-928 MHz band. This put an end to speculation that the 
FCC planned to move vehicle-to-roadside communications (VRC) 
systems off the band entirely and assign them to higher 
frequencies. The ruling provided relief to many owners and 
vendors of ETC systems in the U.S., which all currently use 
that bandwidth, although it came as bad news to Combitech, 
which opened a U.S. office this year to help promote its own 
ETC systems, which operate at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz.

  Elsewhere in the ETC arena, the president and CEO of 
AT/Comm in Marblehead, Mass. apologized in a letter to the 
chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MassPike) 
for an "overheated" and "offensive" campaign to win an ETC 
contract. The letter blamed the offenses on John Hassett, 
who had recently resigned as president of AT/Comm. MassPike 
awarded the contract to MFS Network Technologies in Omaha, 
Neb. Specifications for the system were based on a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by several 
Massachusetts agencies to provide for interoperable 
electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) standards 
within the state.

  No fewer than 15 manufacturers displayed navigation 
systems at the Tokyo Motor Show, and more rental cars in 
America added them as options in more markets. But sales of 
the first factory-installed units of Oldsmobile's Guidestar 
reportedly have been slow. The market for navigation systems 
in the U.S. was complicated by a patent dispute involving 
the two major suppliers of map data and navigation software 
for that market -- Etak in Menlo Park, Calif. and Navigation 
Technologies in Sunnyvale, Calif. -- and Zexel USA, a 
NavTech ally whose technology underlies several of the 
onboard route guidance systems currently for sale.

  While funding for ITS was in question through much of the 
year, laborers in the ITS field found the money to attend 
meetings in ever larger numbers. More than 4,500 attended 
ITS America's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. in March, 
and the 156 exhibitors there represented a 60 percent 
increase over the year before. The second ITS World Congress 
in Yokohama, Japan drew 3,400 participants with 
approximately 300 attendees coming from North America and 
just over 300 from Europe. The annual meeting of the 
International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association 
(IBTTA), combined with the third International Electronic 
Toll and Traffic Management (ETTM) Symposium, drew a record 
crowd of more than 1,100 to New York. The combined Vehicle 
Navigation and Information Systems (VNIS) '95 and Pacific 
Rim TransTech conferences, held in Seattle in July, drew 
about 900 registrants.

VOLVO'S WITHDRAWAL PRECIPITATES
DEMISE OF TELEGUIDE NETWORK

  The plan to shut down Sweden's Teleguide service eliminates
a medium for transmitting routing information to motorists.
The videotext network was scheduled to offer a range of
information services, including a point-to-point route
planning system configured by Volvo AB (see sister
publication, Inside IVHS, Sept. 28, 1992).

  Stockholm-based Teleguide, a consortium consisting of
Swedish Telecom, IBM Sweden and Esselte, disclosed earlier
this month that all services would be terminated April 1. The
fledgling service began operations only last March.

           Routing Never Gets Off the Ground

  Volvo's routing service never made it out of the starting
gate. While tests of the service were run on the videotext
network for two or three months, the routing feature was
never formally introduced as a Teleguide service. Volvo had
been planning to offer the routing service over Teleguide as
part of a customer service package that included maintenance
and car parts information.

  While Volvo officials involved in the project expressed
disappointment that Teleguide services would be terminated
this spring, the Swedish automaker may have contributed to
the demise of the information service by delaying or
effectively cancelling its introduction of services over the
videotext network. Volvo decided in December not to offer its
planned Teleguide services.

  "Volvo's decision was important for all the Teleguide
products. When Volvo got out, this was the 'last piece of the
coffin,'" says Thomas Rickne, marketing director of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and transport planning
at Cyberlogik AB in Gothenburg, Sweden. Cyberlogik was the
supplier of map data and technical support for Volvo's route
planning service. Cyberlogik, in turn, used a routing
algorithm supplied by Distribution Planning Software (DPS) in
Halesowen, West Midlands in the United Kingdom. DPS
manufactures the LogiX product line of routing, scheduling
and fleet management software.

  Volvo's main contribution to the routing service had
focused on the development of the user interface for the
Teleguide terminals. Unlike routing software packages
designed to run on PCs, the Teleguide system was not designed
to display maps of the recommended routes. Rather, it
displayed the point-to-point driving directions as text on
dedicated terminals. Volvo's routing service would have
provided route recommendations for trips on the major highway
and motorway networks. Map data used in the system did not
include street level information, which would obviously
prevent the system from calculating routes to specific sites
within cities.

                     Coming Up Short

  In explaining Volvo's decision to pull out of the Teleguide
project, Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics at
the automaker's facilities in Gothenburg, notes that the
22,000 users currently on the network fall short of the
80,000 that had been expected to have terminals in their
homes and offices by now.

  What really doomed the service, however, was not the lower
than expected number of users, but a lack of willing
investors, says Olle Elioth, managing director at Teleguide.
"We tried to find other investors. We were not successful in
that," says Elioth.

  Teleguide officials announced the plan to cease operations
after Swedish Telecom and Esselte, an office equipment and
software company, decided to withdraw from the project.
Esselte, which has struggled for the past few years, decided
that Teleguide didn't fit into the recently restructured
company, says Elioth.

  Swedish Telecom's decision to pull out of Teleguide
reflects its move out of videotext services altogether.
"They're tired of videotext," says Elioth, adding that
Swedish Telecom plans to shut down its business-to-business
videotext service on Jan. 1, 1994. It has about the same
number of users as Teleguide. "There will be no public
videotext service in Sweden from 1994 onwards," he says.

  Elioth expresses disappointment about the decision to close
the Teleguide information service: "We'll not see anything of
this kind in Sweden this side of the year 2000," he says.

  The three primary investors collectively lost 325 million
Swedish kronor ($43.5 million) on the Teleguide project,
according to Elioth.

  For Volvo, its troubles with Teleguide stemmed from higher
than expected development costs. Sources say Volvo had
trouble developing applications for the videotext
environment. "They were forced to do a lot of basic
programming," says Cyberlogik's Rickne, who adds that the
lack of good software support significantly inflated
development costs. RDS-TMC Tests Set For Dynaguide In
Southern Norway

  While U.S. transportation policy officials continue to
debate the data transmission capabilities of RDS-TMC, their
counterparts in Europe are conducting additional tests of the
system's ability to broadcast traffic information. In the
latest move, transportation officials in Norway are planning
the country's first RDS-TMC (radio data system-traffic
message channel) tests. The Public Roads Administration is
laying the groundwork for a TMC test in Norway's southeastern
corner, not far from Oslo.

  Initial plans call for using the Dynaguide TMC units
developed by Sweden's Volvo AB. Dynaguide, unlike most other
TMC designs, displays traffic information graphically, rather
than displaying TMC text messages.

  "The plan is to test 10 of the Dynaguide units this summer
to see if RDS receivers can work with Dynaguide," says Finn
Berg, project manager for the traffic information project for
the Public Roads Administration in Tonsberg, Norway.

      Volvo Wraps Up First Round of Dynaguide Tests

  Volvo is concluding an initial round of tests in
Gothenburg, Sweden of the first 100 or so Dynaguides built.
Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics at the Swedish
automaker, says Volvo engineers are compiling information
about a six week evaluation of the Dynaguide units. The tests
-- which involved 70 drivers -- got underway in the first
week of December. Hellaker says response to units has been
"very good."

  Dynaguide hardware and software were developed for Volvo by
MMI Systems AS in Sandefjord, Norway. Erik Hovland, an MMI
official, says a handful of the units originally built for
Volvo's tests in Gothenburg could be used for the planned
project in Norway. "We've not decided how many units would be
used," he says. Cost estimates for the project are also not
available.

  The scope of the project should become clearer as Hovland
completes a study about RDS-TMC for the Norwegian
authorities. He says it should be finished by the first of
March. The official name of the project is "traffic
information and control -- year 2000."

  While Berg acknowledges that the government will most
likely foot the bill for the project, he declines to divulge
how much money has been budgeted for the initiative. Berg and
Hovland recently met with the Road Directorate in Oslo to
inform the national office about the project. Presumably,
funding approvals were sought as well.

          Lillehammer Olympics Could Benefit

  Assuming the project in Tonsberg -- a popular weekend
destination for Oslo residents in the summer -- is
successful, the RDS-TMC network could be expanded north to
Lillehammer in time for the winter Olympics next February. "I
think the Roads Administration is very interested to see the
expansion of this project up to the Lillehammer area," says
Hovland, who cautions that such planning is "very
preliminary."

  For the Tonsberg area tests, the planning for which is more
advanced, Hovland says the ALERT-C message protocol used in
the Dynaguide tests in Gothenburg would also be used in
Norway. Modifications recently made to ALERT-C by the
European Broadcasting Union would not be incorporated into
the planned Norway tests, Hovland says. Traffic messages,
however, would have to be translated from Swedish into
Norwegian.

  Dynaguide is an in-vehicle information system that converts
TMC text messages into visual symbols displayed on a
digitized roadway map. The unit consists of a 5" color LCD
that interfaces to a conventional RDS radio.

  Early planning for the Norway project has focused on the
Dynaguide unit. But the Public Roads Administration is also
considering other text-based TMC devices. "We're looking at
both text and graphical displays," says Berg.

  As the manufacturer of Dynaguide, MMI's Hovland is
obviously keen to feature Dynaguide in the test. "As far as I
know, no text-based TMC receivers are under consideration,"
says Hovland, who first approached Berg about establishing
the Oslo area RDS-TMC project.

  While Volvo is not directly involved in the project, a
delegation of Norwegian project officials is scheduled to
visit the automaker's R&D facilities in Gothenburg in mid
March. The trip is designed to familiarize the Norwegian
officials with operation of the TMC network.

  In addition to using similarly configured in-vehicle units,
the Norwegian project will use the same TMC transmission
gear, which is supplied by Sweden-based Teli. "We have to use
equipment we know for the Norway project," says Hovland.
Negotiations are currently underway with NRK, the Norwegian
broadcasting company, and a local radio station, about
transmitting the TMC messages over their subcarriers, says
Berg.

             PC Version Also Available

  Along with the portable units, project officials in Norway
are interested in testing stationary TMC units that feature
the same graphical interface as the Dynaguide design. Hovland
says the PC version of Dynaguide could be installed in hotel
lobbies, gas stations and ferry terminals. "It's already
developed," he says.

JAPAN POLICE AGENCY ADVANCES
IVHS EFFORTS OUTSIDE OF VICS

by Robert L. French
  While Japan's VICS program may be stuck in the mud, two
IVHS initiatives associated with the country's police agency
appear to be making headway independent of the cooperative
program. The Japan Traffic Management Technology Association
(JTMTA), an industry organization that operates under
National Police Agency (NPA) auspices, has helped develop a
real-time traffic information service and a new infrared (IR)
vehicle detector.

  Rather than challenging the legitimacy of VICS (vehicle
information communication system), the JTMTA claims the two
initiatives could spur VICS officials to get their project
going. But industry observers note that the new traffic info
system, called ATISS for advanced traffic information supply
service, essentially serves some of the same functions as
VICS aims to.

  VICS has been moving at a slower pace than RACS and AMTICS,
the competing predecessor projects that were more or less
subsumed by VICS in 1991. The Ministry of Post &
Telecommunications -- which is the equivalent of the Federal
Communications Commission in the U.S. -- practically forced
RACS and AMTICS participants to join the VICS project, say
sources.

  The RACS (Road Automobile Communication System) project of
the Ministry of Construction (MC) and the AMTICS (Advanced
Mobile Traffic Information Communication System) project of
the NPA were vigorously pursuing independent traffic
information and communication infrastructures to service
essentially identical in-vehicle navigation and information
systems. RACS and AMTICS underwent several stages of
experimentation between 1986 and their consolidation in 1991.

  The most visible VICS activity in recent months has been
the preparation for a VICS demonstration experiment,
according to the recent issue of the VICS Newsletter. The
VICS demo is scheduled to be in operation in Tokyo later this
year.

           A New Traffic Information Service

  In the meantime, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,
in conjunction with JTMTA, has spent two years developing
ATISS to make graphic traffic information available in real-
time to terminals -- i.e., computers, fax machines, TVs, --
in homes or offices via public switched telephone networks or
CATV networks. ATISS may also service in-vehicle units via
mobile telephone networks. Computers and in-vehicle terminals
may use the ATISS information in conjunction with digital
road maps stored on CD-ROM.

  Traffic information to be supplied by ATISS is essentially
the same as that originally planned for AMTICS, but with the
addition of current travel time for selected road links. An
ATISS operating company owned jointly by the Tokyo metropolitan
government and private industry will be started in June 1993 to
provide traffic information, for a fee, within the Tokyo
metropolitan area. The company will maintain an ATISS traffic
information database using data from the traffic control center
of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and will interface
with the communications media. Commercial operation of ATISS is
expected to commence after two years of experimental operation
involving up to 4,000 terminals Officials are planning a similar
venture for Osaka.

            NPA Develops Optical Beacon

  The second police project is the "optical beacon," a new
type of IR vehicle detector that also serves as a high-
bandwidth communication device for supplying traffic
information to, and for receiving link travel times from,
equipped vehicles. The optical beacon was developed by the
NPA in conjunction with the JTMTA.

  As a vehicle detector, the optical beacon reportedly
functions as well or better than the ultrasonic detector
widely used in Japan. In addition, the optical beacon has
two-way communication capability with a downlink data rate of
1,024 kilobits and an uplink rate of 64 kilobits per second.
Sources say the optical detector is considerably less
expensive than the ultrasonic device. The NPA plans to
install 5,000 optical beacons per year starting in April this
year. The devices will be integrated into the traffic control
centers already in place in 74 major cities throughout Japan.

  The NPA's objective is to upgrade the existing traffic
control system and move toward the next generation system
under the UTMS (universal traffic management system) concept;
the optical beacon would function as an enabling technology
of the new system.

             VICS to Evaluate Optical Beacon

  The VICS Promotional Council, which has responsibility
through its committees for conducting investigations and
research as well as for promoting the use of VICS technology,
has agreed to study the optical beacon as one of several
possible communications media. Other candidate communication
links explored by VICS and/or the predecessor RACS and AMTICS
projects include microwave beacons, tele-terminals (cellular-
like mobile data communication systems) and FM sidebands (see
IH, September 1992).

  An agreement last fall by the VICS Promotional Council that
its operational body would be organized after consulting with
relevant government authorities lends credence to the notion
that the program has been stalled. The supply of VICS
information would begin soon after the operational body is
established. The VICS operation will collect and consolidate
traffic data from the MC for intercity and urban toll roads
and from the police departments for urban streets. The
operation will interface via two or more communication links
with in-vehicle units.

  Other current VICS activities include those of the
international liaison office of the VICS Promotional Council
which, in addition to publishing the VICS Newsletter, serves
as the principal interface between Japanese IVHS activities
and those in Europe and North America. VICS, in essence, is
the closest Japanese counterpart of ERTICO in Europe and IVHS
America.

TIGER PROJECT SEEKS LICENSE,
FUNDING FROM U.K. GOVERMENT

  Over the next several months, the ill-fated Autoguide
project, now dubbed TIGER, may finally get underway. The
project's two stumbling blocks -- funding support and a
license from the Department of Transport to operate a dynamic
route guidance system in central London -- are being
addressed with renewed vigor by private and public
participants.

            Statement in House of Commons

  The importance the British government is putting on the new
project was highlighted in late December when Steven Norris,
the Transport Minister for London, took the unusual step of
issuing a statement in the House of Commons explaining the
background of the project. In the statement he confirmed the
view that the latest developments in cellular radio have
superseded the infrared (IR) technology and a new trial was
being prepared which the government would monitor closely.

  However, due to the adverse publicity stemming from the
continued delay in implementing the IR beacon-based
Autoguide, both the Department of Transport and GEC, TIGER's
main backers, are wary about publicizing the new project.

        License Could Be Granted Within 10 Weeks

  In any event, it looks as if the project is proceeding.
Eric Sampson, a senior official at the Department of
Transport, estimates that a license under the Road Traffic
Act could be granted to TIGER (Traffic Information and
Guidance on European Roads) officials within the next 10
weeks. Several versions of a licensing agreement have been
drafted. "Lawyers are crawling over it, as lawyers do," he
says.

  While Sampson acknowledges that the licensing process is
advancing slowly, he says GEC is largely responsible for the
pace of the negotiations and that the firm does not seem
unhappy with the current status of the effort. "GEC is not on
my doorstep screaming and shouting," he says.

  In addition to seeking the license, TIGER officials have
applied for government funding for the project from the
Department of Trade and Industry. GEC's Nigel Stansfield, the
project manager, says the total cost of the trial should be
10 million pounds sterling to 15 million pounds sterling.
Project costs would be shared among TIGER participants and
the British government. Funding from the Department of Trade
and Industry would be channeled through the PROMETHEUS
program, which Stansfield says could provide 25 to 40 percent
of the project costs.

  Along with GEC, TIGER participants include: Ford, British
Telecom, and the two main motoring organizations, the Royal
Automobile Club (RAC) and the Automobile Association (AA).

           200 to 500 Cars Could Be Equipped

  Stansfield says each of the main participants will have a
specific role within the project. GEC will manage the trial
as well as operating a dedicated traffic information center,
which is slated to be in North London. Ford would supply test
vehicles, probably up to 200 but maybe as high as 500. The
RAC is set to supply the traffic information, which would be
transmitted to the North London traffic center from the RAC's
own traffic control center in Croyden, south London. The AA
would supply the in-vehicle digitized road maps while British.
Telecom would supply the in-vehicle communications hardware.
as well as the cellular link. TIGER is planning to use Cellnet,
a private cellular company which is 60 percent owned by British
Telecom.

  For in-vehicle navigation systems, TIGER will most likely
use equipment from Philips, Motorola and Robert Bosch,
according to Stansfield. Following the trial, TIGER officials
may decide to market one of the three systems or another
design.

  TIGER is designed to guide motorists through the least
congested streets. Dynamic traffic information would be
transmitted to the specially equipped cars over the cellular
network. The vehicles themselves would act as probes of the
roadway network as vehicle positions and travel speeds would
be transmitted back to the traffic center. The field trial's
boundaries have not yet been established. But it's expected
that the route guidance system would cover the area within
the city's North and South Circular Roads.

              Local Concern About Rat-Runners

  While the Department of Transport may be in favor of the
TIGER project, some local authorities have another opinion.
John Davies, director of highways for the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea -- one of the busy inner London
boroughs -- and also transport advisor to the London Boroughs
Association -- which represents the views of many London
boroughs -- fears route guidance systems are likely to
encourage motorists to abandon the main roads and start using
otherwise quiet residential streets, much to the annoyance of
local residents.

  He believes the deployment of more traditional traffic
mitigation measures would be a more effective way of reducing
local congestion. Davies favors better parking control and
"urban clearways," rather than trying to displace vehicles
from busy streets altogether.

  If necessary, Davies says he will not hesitate to prevent
cars equipped with route guidance systems from using
residential streets in his borough. "We shall make some side
streets one-way only and put chicanes and speed humps on
others to make sure motorists won't use them."

  Like other London borough engineers, Davies says he already
gets many letters from local residents complaining about
excessive traffic on residential streets, and he fears that a
route guidance system would simply encourage more motorists
to become "rat-runners," (who try to dodge traffic on the
major roads by driving on smaller, residential routes).

  The Department of Transport's Sampson acknowledges that
local concerns about rat-runners have to be addressed. "The
boroughs are worried that route guidance systems will send
traffic from the larger roads onto smaller roads," he says.

  As part of its role in the project, the Department of
Transport has announced it will hold discussions with all the
relevant bodies that might be affected by the project. They
include representatives from London's 33 borough councils,
the Metropolitan Police and London's Traffic Director.

  Despite his concerns, Davies does believe a dynamic route
guidance system would be useful in helping motorists find the
best bridges to drive across the river Thames. At present, he
says many motorists make uninformed guesses about which
bridges are least congested.

  Stansfield predicts that the main trial should begin in the
summer of 1994 and will last for at least six months.
Assuming the project is a success, he estimates that a
commercial product could be available by 1996 or '97, perhaps
with a price tag as low as 500 pounds sterling with an annual
subscription fee of 100 to 200 pounds sterling.

U.S. DELEGATION SEEKS EURO
SUPPORT FOR NEW ISO PANEL

  A group of IVHS industry officials in the U.S. is spearheading
an intiative to establish international IVHS standards. The IVHS
division of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in
Warrendale, Pa. has succeeded in establishing an international
IVHS standards committee within the International Standards
Organization (ISO) in Geneva.

  Earlier this month, the new technical committee, TC 204,
held a "preparatory meeting" in Geneva in an attempt to
solicit support and cooperation from European IVHS/RTI
officials already involved in standards making activity.
Seventeen officials attended the meeting. The main
standardization organizations in Europe were represented at
the one-day event, including the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), European Electrotechnical
Standardization Organization (CENELEC), European
Standardization Organization (CEN), International Telegraph
and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) and the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

      SAE Serves as Secretariat of New Committee

  "We really have the support of all these national
organizations," says Arlan Stehney, an SAE official who is
serving as secretariat of the new ISO committee. SAE, as an
organization, will serve as secretariat of TC 204 on behalf
of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
according to Stehney.

  While the list of organizations and acronyms may be
confusing, the stated purpose of the new committee is not,
say its organizers. "What the ISO does is really pull them
all together," says Stehney. "Their standards efforts will
channel into the ISO committee." He stresses that the new ISO
committee will not replace other RTI/IVHS standardization
efforts currently underway.

        International Standards: A Tall Order

  Electronic toll collection and other related applications,
such as road pricing, is an area of immediate concern to RTI
officials in Europe and to their counterparts in the U.S. As
the number of electronic toll systems competing in the
marketplace continues to grow rapidly, the incompatibility of
those systems threatens to compromise the convenience gains
promised by the technology. The well-documented difficulty
that state and regional officials have encountered in trying
to establish standards for electronic tolling underscores the
complexity of the issues the ISO is trying to address on an
international scale. The establishment of regional, let alone
national, standards has proved to be a daunting task.

  The initiative is obviously an ambitious one and it remains
to be seen whether the existing standardizing bodies will
fully cooperate with ISO's new IVHS committee, which,
incidentally, has tentatively adopted the European acronym
RTI, for road transport informatics.

             Duplication of Work Avoided

  Considerable work on IVHS/RTI standards is already underway
in Europe, particularly within CEN and CENELEC. "We're trying
to avoid any kind of duplication of work," says Siemens'
director of exterior relations, Heinz Sodeikat, who attended
the ISO meeting on behalf of the IEC and CENELEC. Sodeikat
points out that CEN and CENELEC have previously reached
agreements about which RTI application areas the two groups
will develop standards for. CENELEC focuses on
"electrotechnical" issues while CEN covers non-
electrotechnical systems, he says.

  While Sodeikat expresses a willingness to cooperate with
the new ISO committee, he notes that there are already "too
many" committees working on RTI standardization issues.
"Unfortunately, it's inevitable," he says.

  Dik Van Wijk, a project manager from the Dutch Ministry of
Transport who serves as chairman of CEN's RTI committee, is
supportive of the new ISO committee. What's more, he says
support for it is growing in Europe. Initially, officials
from many European countries "did not show much enthusiasm"
for the ISO initiative, says Van Wijk. But since the ISO
technical board formally approved the RTI committee plan in
December, more countries have expressed a willingness to
cooperate with it.

  Six countries, including three in Europe, have already
established official links to the ISO committee. They are the
Netherlands, U.K., Czechoslovakia, Japan, China and the U.S.
Others are expected to join. "Germany has already indicated
that they're interested," says Stehney.

  Even with their most optimistic outlook, organizers of the
ISO committee don't expect to establish international
standards for all IVHS applications. "There may be areas
where international standards are not viable," acknowledges
Stehney, who cites radio frequency allocation as a likely
problem area. "You can't standardize frequencies," he says.

  Richard J. Weiland, vice chairman of SAE's IVHS division,
agrees. "The magic word in the international arena is
harmonization," he says. Weiland is the general manager of
SEI Technology Group as well as chairman of the standards and
protocols committee of IVHS America, the Washington, D.C.-
based advocacy group that serves as an advisory committee to
the U.S. Department of Transportation.

  Along with other members of the U.S. delegation, Weiland
was pleased with the outcome of the Geneva meeting. Two
informal resolutions were passed. One recognizes the
organizations currently involved with RTI standardization in
Europe and recommends that once an initial work program is
accepted, that an ISO/CEN coordination meeting be convened.
The other resolution stemmed from a separate meeting the same
day with an existing ISO committee -- TC 22 -- that is
already working on RTI standards. TC 22 is ISO's
road/vehicles committee. The new and existing ISO committees
have agreed that TC 22 will retain primary responsibility for
man-machine interface and other in-vehicle systems while the
new RTI committee -- TC 204 -- will be responsible for
overall systems and infrastructure issues.

       ISO Committee Proposes 11 Working Groups

  ISO's new RTI committee is proposing to establish 11
working groups. They are 1. architecture and open system
interfaces; 2. spatial databases; 3. traffic/transit/parking
information collection and distribution; 4. traffic
management systems and coordination; 5. public, emergency and
commercial fleet management; 6. short range communications;
7. wide area communications; 8. navigation, positioning and
route guidance; 9. safety critical software; 10. human
interfaces and ergonomics; and 11. vehicle/highway
automation.

  The structure of the new committee and its program of work
will be discussed further at the first formal meeting of TC
204, which will be in Washington, D.C. Stehney says the event
is scheduled to take place April 19-21 at the Georgetown
University Conference Center. The meeting is open to
interested parties. For more information, call Stehney at
+412-776-4841.

GENERAL LOGISTICS EXPANDS
TRAFFICMASTER IN U.S. AND U.K

  General Logistics' Trafficmaster network is expanding
within the United Kingdom and, most recently, abroad as well.
The Luton, U.K. firm has secured its first licensee in the
U.S.

  Westinghouse Electric Corp. in Baltimore, Md. has licensed
the technology for the traffic information service from
General Logistics. For an undisclosed sum, Westinghouse has
acquired the exclusive rights to market and operate
Trafficmaster in four regions of the U.S. The system, which
notifies motorists about traffic congestion on local
highways, is currently operating on the M25 motorway in
London.

            Westinghouse Becomes U.S. Licensee

  "It's the only commercialized system successfully operating
in the world. There's no reason we shouldn't have it here,"
says Dan B. Zeitlin, manager of IVHS systems at Westinghouse
and the person in charge of its Trafficmaster project.

  As part of the agreement, General Logistics will supply
Westinghouse with the in-vehicle hardware and roadside
equipment as well as training and engineering support.
Depending on which firm you ask, the agreement extends for 12
or 15 years. Both parties describe the pact as a "long term
agreement."

   Westinghouse is planning to launch two Trafficmaster pilot
projects this year and to introduce commercial service at
those same sites next year. Don't expect to see
advertisements for Trafficmaster, however. The system will be
marketed under a different name, which Westinghouse hasn't
yet selected. The firm is open to suggestions, according to
Zeitlin, who says Westinghouse's legal department and
marketing gurus are mulling over a list of proposed names.
"It's a huge list," he says.

  While the two firms signed the agreement in late December,
neither has formally announced it. What's more, neither party
will say what the contract is worth nor what regions of the
U.S. are covered in the agreement. "I'm not at liberty to
disclose the value of the deal. But we're very happy with
it," says David K. Martell, chairman and managing director at
General Logistics.

  Westinghouse plans to release more details about the
agreement after it has secured approval from a local
transportation authority to proceed with a pilot project.
"Clearly, we need the public authorities' approval," says
Zeitlin. "We're having discussions with transportation
officials."

           Trafficmaster on Capital Beltway?

  Sources close to the project say Westinghouse is initially
targeting the Capital Beltway in Washington, D.C. and the
Baltimore Beltway as sites for the first pilot projects.
While Zeitlin declines to confirm this, he doesn't deny it
either. "Certainly, Maryland is of great interest because
we're based here. And the D.C. area is a good market," says
Zeitlin in response to questions about the two sites.

  Martell says the agreement permits Westinghouse to operate
Trafficmaster services in four states. Zeitlin says the
licensing agreement covers four territories, and that more
than four states are included in those territories. In any
event, Zeitlin says Westinghouse wants to establish
Trafficmaster services on the east coast, west coast and in
the midwest.

  At present, Westinghouse is the only Trafficmaster licensee
in the U.S. General Logistics, however, is currently engaged
in negotiations with other firms interested in marketing
Trafficmaster elsewhere in the U.S. Martell doesn't expect
any other agreements will be signed in the next "couple
months." He says the Westinghouse deal is "by far the most
advanced" of the initiatives underway in North America.
General Logistics has already signed licensing agreements
with firms in Italy and Austria.

           U.K. Expansion Set for April 27

  Back in the U.K., General Logistics has set April 27 as the
launch date for the expanded Trafficmaster network, which
will extend to Birmingham, Bristol and the Channel ports. The
existing network includes 120 infrared (IR) traffic detector
sites; the expanded network will add 300 more sites. Martell
says detectors at 230 of the 300 new sites have already been
installed.

  To date, Martell says there are more than 3,000
Trafficmaster subscribers using the London area network. Over
the past six months, he says 200 new subscribers have been
recruited per month. "With the geographic expansion, that
figure should increase dramatically," he says.

  Unlike most other IVHS projects in the U.S., Westinghouse's
Trafficmaster plan doesn't call for federal funding.
Trafficmaster is a commercial service: in the U.K., the
portable unit is priced at 199 pounds sterling and the
monthly subscription charge is 20 pounds sterling.
Installation is 50 pounds sterling. A rental option permits
subscribers to pay 30 pounds sterling per month in user fees
in addition to the 50 pound sterling installation charge.

  While pricing has not been established for the U.S.
introduction of Trafficmaster, the basic system design will
not be modified by Westinghouse, at least not initially. The
portable receiver is designed to work in a vehicle. The
unit's backlit LCD displays areas of congestion on the
motorway network by means of flashing blocks, which show the
location, speed and direction of snarled traffic.

  The system relies on a dedicated network of IR traffic
detectors that log the speed of passing vehicles. If the IR
devices determine that traffic is traveling below a pre-set
threshold of 30 mph, a message is relayed via a data radio
link supplied by Paknet, Ltd. to the Trafficmaster control
center in Luton. Updated traffic information is then
transmitted every three minutes from the control center to
the in-car receivers. The information is broadcast to the
portable units over the Air Call Paging network. Westinghouse
is planning to use IR traffic detectors and a paging network
for its Trafficmaster system in the U.S. "We're in
negotiations with a paging company," says Zeitlin.
Westinghouse may not, however, use a data radio link to
transmit information from the remote traffic detectors to the
control center. Zeitlin says project officials are
considering other means of transmitting the raw traffic data,
such as land lines.

         Westinghouse Initiates Negotiations

  The Westinghouse/General Logistics deal stemmed from
negotiations initiated by Westinghouse. "They approached us
about a year ago," says General Logistics' Martell.
Westinghouse, which is making a considerable investment in
several IVHS applications areas, sees Trafficmaster as one of
its traveler information system offerings. "This is only part
of it," says Zeitlin. In the future, Westinghouse may
integrate the Trafficmaster data with other traffic
management systems, he says.

U.K. RTI GROUP LINES UP
STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS

  The newly formed RTI/IVHS information group in the United
Kingdom has established a steering committee that includes
several key players in the industry. RTI Focus (UK) Ltd., a
new group with non-profit status based at the government's
Transport Research Laboratory in Berkshire, has the support
of the Department of Transport and major electronics firms,
transport consultancies and academia.

      Department of Transport Supports New Group

  Susan Harvey, the company's founding chief executive, says
the steering committee consists of representatives from the
Department of Transport, the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), Peek
Traffic, GEC Traffic Controls, Jaguar, Dowty Electronics, the
Royal Automobile Club (RAC), the Met Office, University of
London Transport Studies Unit, Croyden Borough Council
(London), Strathclyde Borough Council (Glasgow), London
Transport, the Metropolitan Police, Travers Morgan and
Halcrow Fox.

  Harvey says that the steering committee members have had to
pay a hefty 4,000 pound sterling annual subscription fee,
which will help defray the 150,000 pound sterling start-up
and operating costs. However, she says the annual fee for the
steering committee members is expected to decline to 3,000
pounds sterling in the second year and to 2,000 pounds
sterling in the third year.

  Harvey says the next step for RTI Focus is to recruit
additional members. She expects the group to be fully
operational by June and, in time, to include up to 200 firms.
The cost of becoming a member without representation on the
steering committee has been set at 500 pounds sterling.

  The group's primary role, according to Harvey, is to
promote the interests of its members as well as advancing RTI
developments. One of the main benefits of membership, she
says, will be access to the large RTI database which is to be
established at the TRL and will contain details of industry
firms in the U.K. as well as RTI developments abroad.

  In addition, she says the group will publish a quarterly
newsletter, arrange four meetings a year for the steering
committee and organize two seminars per year which all
members would be eligible to attend.

         Liaison Sought With Other Associations

  RTI Focus has received support from officials in Brussels
and from the Department of Transport in London about
presenting papers at upcoming seminars, Harvey says. In the
future, she hopes the group will have enough funding to be
able to commission its own RTI research. The group has also
established contacts with officials at the ERTICO and DRIVE
offices in Brussels and at the IVHS America office in
Washington, D.C.

  Prior to starting up the RTI association, Harvey was an
industrial advisor and transport specialist at the National
Economic Development Office (NEDO) in London. In addition to
Harvey's role at RTI Focus, she has recently established a
new transport consultancy in London, named Traffic Solutions
Ltd. Harvey, along with partner Peter O'Neil, who formerly
worked at the DRIVE office in Brussels, is planning to do RTI
consulting work.

                 How Big Is The Market?

  A recent NEDO report estimates the size of the UK RTI
industry at about 60 million pounds sterling. By the year
2010, NEDO estimates the RTI market will be worth 3 billion
pounds sterling. "The same phenomenal growth is also being
predicted worldwide," says Harvey. The biggest potential
growth areas in RTI are dynamic route guidance systems and
electronic tolls, she says.

  Eamonn McArdle, managing director of Peek Traffic, believes
the new group will play a significant role in promoting RTI.
"We hope the group will campaign on behalf of major RTI
issues as well as helping to push sales of new U.K. RTI
products for all the members."

NEWS IN BRIEF

  *It looks as if the new presidential administration in
Washington, D.C. will continue to support, and fund, IVHS. As
part of his recently unveiled economic plan, President Bill
Clinton is calling for $345 million in IVHS funding for
fiscal years 1994-1997. The plan also calls for $100 million
in IVHS funding for FY98, which is beyond Clinton's current
term.

  While these numbers appear to be reduced from the IVHS
funding levels outlined in the six-year Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) passed in 1991, the
budget numbers cited above reportedly are intended to be
additions to the ISTEA provisions, according to the Federal
Highway Administration, which sought an explanation of the
figures from the Office of Management and Budget. ISTEA
authorizes $113 million per year in IVHS funding. If Congress
approves Clinton's plan, federal funding for IVHS over the
next four years could top $200 million per year. By
comparison, the federal government -- under the Bush
Administration -- has budgeted $143 million in IVHS funding
for the current fiscal year.

  *Copies of the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT)
IVHS strategic plan are available from the FHWA's office of
traffic management and IVHS. The DOT submitted the five year
plan to Congress in December as required by ISTEA. Requests
for copies can be faxed to the FHWA at 202-366-2249 or mailed
to the agency at 400 7th Street S.W., Washington, D.C.,
20590.

  The 67 page document outlines the goals and milestones of
the DOT's IVHS program for the next five years. "What is
needed is a 'smarter' surface transportation system, one that
actually functions as an integrated intermodal system,
offering improved safety, more efficient use of
infrastructure, and enhanced user choices through the
application of IVHS technologies and services," writes the
DOT in the executive summary of its report.

  While the report acknowledges IVHS America's contribution
to DOT's plan, the federal agency's report does not derive
directly from the five year strategic plan developed by the
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, says George Beronio, a
systems engineer at FHWA.

  DOT's plan establishes 18 milestones to be accomplished
during the next five years. "Beyond 1997, deployment of a
nationally compatible IVHS system will become the
Department's primary concern. Work will shift towards
supporting deployment of IVHS user services, and continuing
progress on long-term IVHS goals, especially the Automated
Highway System," writes the DOT.

  *Following expansion of its Trafficmaster network up to the
Birmingham area, General Logistics is hoping to establish its
traffic information system in Scotland. David K. Martell,
chairman and managing director at General Logistics in Luton
near London, says negotiations are underway with the Scottish
Office about installing Trafficmaster on the motorways in the
Glasgow and Edinburgh area. While compatible with the system
in England, Martell says the Scottish system would be
operated separately.

  *For electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) system
vendors, the order of the day seems to be to sue one another.
In the latest move, AT/Comm in Marblehead, Mass. has filed
two patent infringement suits against its chief competitors,
Amtech and Mark IV/Vapor. In the suits, filed in U.S.
District Court in Boston, AT/Comm claims "that the newest
generation of electronic toll collection systems known as
read-write, in the forms produced by Amtech and Mark
IV/Vapor, are in direct conflict with claims under AT/Comm
patents," according to a statement issued by AT/Comm. The
Massachusetts ETTM vendor says the suits could directly
affect procurements in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and
Orlando.

Japan's tire demand to hit 2nd highest in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's domestic demand for motor vehicle tires for this year
is expected to rise 8.5% from last year to 1,027,000 tons, the
second highest level on record following the 1.03 million tons
posted in 1990, an industry association said Monday.
     The Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association said demand
for new tires will reach 210,000 tons, up 0.7%, while that for
replacement tires will increase 8.2% to 403,000 tons.
     Demand for tires for export will rise 13.3% to 414,000 tons,
the association said.
     Akira Suzuki, managing director of the association, said,
''Total tire output for this year is certain to hit a record high
given production plans of domestic tire makers for November and
December.''
     The steady growth stems largely from brisk exports to Southeast
Asia and Europe, and strong demand for replacement tires,
particularly those for trucks, association officials said.
     Domestic demand for tires next year will fall 1.7% from this
year to 1.01 million tons, the association said.

Japan's Nov. vehicle output falls 9.1%++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's motor vehicle output in November fell 9.1% to 863,460
for the sixth straight month of declines from year-earlier levels,
an industry association reported Monday.
     The figure brought the number of vehicles produced in the 11
months to November to 9,423,306, down 2.8% from a year earlier, the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
     Domestic sales of motor vehicles in November rose 4.6% to
593,073, while exports are estimated to have fallen 21%, it said.
     Passenger car output in November came to 655,067 vehicles, down
5.7% from a year earlier for the sixth straight month of decrease.
     Output of trucks fell 18.9% to 204,047, also marking the
sixth consecutive decline.
     Production of buses, however, rose 8.1% to 4,346 for the first
rise in seven months, the association said.
     Of passenger car production, automobiles with engine capacity
of over 2 liters accounted for 218,532, down 7.8%, and smaller cars
fell by the same margin to 354,714, it said.
     In contrast, output of minicars with engine capacity of less
than 660 cc jumped 12.3% to 81,821, it said.
     Sales of passenger cars in the domestic market in November rose
7.0% to 380,405, with sales of trucks up 0.8% to 211,784.
     Motorcycle production in November fell 9.0% from the same month
last year to 210,451, after rising 1.5% in October.
     The association said cumulative production of motorcycles in the
first 11 months of this year grew 2.0% over the same period
last year to 2,540,235.
     The association said sales for the whole of 1995 are estimated
to reach 2.74 million units, up about 0.5% over the previous year
and the first rise in three years.
     It said brisk sales of bikes with 50 cc engines were a major
factor for the gain.
     The association said production of 50-cc bikes for the
January-November period soared 10.3% over a year earlier to 886,077
units.

Toyota Motor to promote younger managers on merit basis+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. will start promoting
younger workers to managerial posts, in a personnel shakeup from
Jan. 1, on the basis of merit rather than seniority, company
officials said Monday.
     The officials, however, said only a few younger personnel were
appointed as department chiefs or deputy department chiefs this time,
since it was the first round of promotion reform.
     The company also unveiled a sweeping reorganization program
involving both domestic and overseas operations.
     Emphasis will be put on consolidation and realignment of
administrative and production departments in North America, where
local vehicle production is expected to increase, the officials said.

Kantor welcomes progress in Japan's auto market opening+

WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Thursday he
welcomes progress in Japan's market-opening and expansion of
Japanese automobile transplants in the six months since an
automotive trade accord with Japan was concluded.
     ''I am pleased with the progress made to date, particularly in
the areas of deregulation of the Japanese after-market and the
increased investment in Japanese auto transplant operations,'' he
said in a statement.
     The accord reached in Geneva between Kantor and Japanese trade
minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in June averted the imposition of 5.6
billion dollars in sanctions on Japanese luxury car imports.
     ''The progress in these areas translates into real benefits for
American workers and American companies,'' the statement said.
     ''We will continue to vigorously monitor implementation of the
agreement to ensure strict compliance,'' Kantor said, noting that
U.S. exports of autos and auto parts for the third quarter of 1995
have increased by 31% over the same period of last year.

Toyota tops TSE list of aggregated stock value+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Toyota Motor Corp. topped the 1995 rankings for high stock
value released by the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Friday.
     The list showed the closing price of Toyota stock at the end of
1995 trading Friday standing at 2,190 yen per share for an aggregated
value of 8,191.7 billion yen.
     Japan's leading automaker was followed by three financial
institutions, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Bank and
Sumitomo Bank for second, third and fourth places.
     Domestic telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. ranked eighth and Nomura Securities Co. placed 10th.
     The exchange also said an average 357.02 million shares were
traded daily in 1995, up 8.6% over the previous year's 328.47
million shares.
     The value of daily trading, however, was down 5.5% at 315.7
billion yen, it said.
     The exchange said the trading value fell below 300 billion yen
from March to June but then turned upward in July on active buying by
foreign investors.
     In December, it said, the value of daily trading hit the year's
high of 471 billion yen.

5-year airport buildup program to begin in FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government on Monday endorsed the Transport Ministry's
five-year airport consolidation program which will entail total
investment of 3.6 trillion yen, starting in fiscal 1996, ministry
officials said.
     They said the budgetary appropriations were incorporated in a
draft budget for fiscal 1996.
     A total of 141.4 billion yen will be disbursed as public works
expenditures related to airport consolidation in the initial year, up
7.3% over the current year, they said.
     In addition, they said 563 billion yen will be earmarked for the
program from a special account for the airport consolidation program,
up 2.7% over the current year.
     The initial-year outlays will include 76.3 billion yen for the
expansion of New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, east of
Tokyo.
     An appropriation of 191.6 billion yen will be earmarked for the
construction of new runways at Haneda International Airport in
Tokyo, the officials said.
     The new fiscal budget also will include 30.5 billion yen for the
consolidation of two existing superexpress railways in northern Japan
and construction of a new superexpress line in the southern main
island of Kyushu, they said.
     The government will provide 4.8 billion yen for the
technological development of a linear motor railway and 14.7 billion
yen for construction of local railways, the officials said.

Snow, strong winds grip Hokkaido, air traffic disrupted+

SAPPORO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Snow and strong winds hit the main northern island of Hokkaido
on Monday, wreaking havoc with transportation systems as flights
into and out of New Chitose Airport and train runs were canceled.
     Ninety-nine schools in Hokkaido were also forced to close as a
Siberian cold wave gripped northern Japan and buffeted much of the
Japanese archipelago.
     A typhoon-strength low-pressure system centered in the Pacific
Ocean off Hokkaido disrupted transportation systems, causing 47
flights into and out of New Chitose Airport to be canceled along with
train runs.
     Chitose airport, the gateway to Hokkaido, had been
intermittently closed since Sunday evening.
     An estimated 43,000 passengers on the Japan Railways and other
railway systems in northern Japan were also stranded by the weather
when 117 train runs, including eight JR express train runs, were
canceled, railway officials said.
     One person was missing after a fishing boat was overturned in a
weather-related accident in the mouth of a river near Oga, Akita
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast, police said.
     According to the Sapporo meteorological observatory, the low
pressure system east of Hokkaido is expected to bring heavy snow to
the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk region through Tuesday.
     During 24 hours by 3 p.m. Monday, 32 centimeters of snow had
fallen in Kushiro, while 23 cm were recorded in Tomakomai.  The 10
cm falling in Sapporo added to the 74-cm accumulation there, 53
cm more than the average.
     In western Japan, accidents caused by the rough weather were
also reported.  In Kyoto Prefecture, a 57-year-old man died when his
tractor hit a support post in his storehouse, causing the
snow-covered tin roof to collapse on him, police said.
     In neighboring Shiga Prefecture, a 52-year-old woman was found
dead in a stream near her home.  She is believed to have slipped on
the snow-covered road and fallen into the stream, police said.
     Road, train and air traffic systems were also affected by the
weather.
     The Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for heavy snow,
strong winds and high waves across wide areas ranging from northern
to western Japan.
     In some mountainous areas, snow of up to 80 cm is expected to
fall by Tuesday morning.

Air India plane makes emergency landing at Karachi+

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     A Dubai-bound Air India jetliner with 179 people aboard made an
emergency landing at Karachi airport Thursday after a hoax telephone
call that a bomb had been planted on the plane, Pakistani Television
Corp. (PTV) reported.
     PTV said the flight had originated in New Delhi and was in
midair when it was diverted to Karachi, following a call received by
Indian aviation authorities that a bomb was aboard.
     No bomb was found but the plane could not leave due to several
technical problems, PTV said.
     The passengers were accommodated in Karachi and being sent to
Dubai on different flights, it said.

More ship export contracts being made in yen+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     More yen-denominated export contracts for Japanese ships are
being made reflecting views in the industry that the yen is unlikely
to rise in the near future, a spokesman at the Japan Ship Exporters
Association said Monday.
     ''A lot of people apparently expect the yen to stay around
current levels against the dollar for the time being,'' the spokesman
said.
     He said the ratio of yen-based export contracts to all
contracts on a ton basis dropped to 20.8% in April and 14.5% in May,
but has increased over the months, standing at 52.4% in October and
53.3% in November.
     ''The share is likely to stay above 50% in December,'' he said,
noting that shipping companies are now willing to pay in yen because
record low interest rates in Japan make it attractive to procure
funds in the Japanese currency.
     During the dollar's drop which continued until last summer,
shipowners had asked to pay export contracts for ships in dollars,
fearing that payment in yen would prove costly should the yen rise
further against the dollar.

Kobe Port wins British award for postquake recovery+

KOBE, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The specialist British trade magazine Containerization
International says in its December edition it has chosen the
quake-ravaged port of Kobe in western Japan for its ''Company of the
Year'' award for 1995, port officials said Thursday.
     The magazine, which is distributed in some 120 countries, chose
the port over more than a dozen other companies and organizations
around the world for the rapid manner in which it is recovering from
the destructive impact of the Jan. 17 Great Hanshin Earthquake.
     The quake rendered much of the port of Kobe inoperable, and left
some 6,300 dead in the city and its environs.
     An official at Kobe's Port authority said he considers the award
the result of a concerted effort by the city's administration and the
private sector.
     ''We'd like to see the prize as an incentive toward recovery,''
he said.

Seibu Railway suffers 5.1 bil. yen forex loss+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Seibu Railway Co. has suffered a 5.1 billion yen foreign
exchange loss through helping a U.S. subsidiary but the loss will
not affect its fiscal 1995 earnings, a company official said
Thursday.
     The loss emerged after the railway operator bought preferred
shares issued by its Hawaiian subsidiary as part of its capital
increase, using 84 million dollars Seibu lent to it producing a
foreign exchange loss of 2.85 billion yen, Masao Horiguchi, managing
director of Seibu, told a news conference.
     Horiguchi said the replacement of the loans with preferred
shares is to reduce the burden of interest payments by Aina Kamalii
Corp. and thus to improve its earnings standing.
     Aina Kamalii runs hotels and golf courses in Hawaii.
     Seibu Railway has no plans to revise its earnings projection for
the current fiscal year ending March 31, announced Nov. 24, because
the loss had already been factored in, he said.
     According to the projection, Seibu Railway's unconsolidated
pretax profit will reach 500 million yen on operating revenues of 229
billion yen.  Net profits are expected to hit 2.3 billion yen.
     By the end of next March, the company will replace another 76
million dollars worth of the loan with preferred shares to be issued
by Aina Kamalii, producing a foreign exchange loss of some 2.3
billion yen, but this loss, too, has been discounted, Horiguchi said.
     The rest of Seibu Railway's loans to Aina Kamalii, totaling 560
million dollars, will be replaced with preferred shares in the next
fiscal year, he said.
     This is likely to incur a foreign exchange loss of some 4
billion yen, which the company is considering offsetting by selling
land, he said.

ADTRANZ AND POLISH RAIL TO SIGN USD200 MILLION DEAL

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

ADTRANZ, the joint venture between ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swedish-Swiss
engineering group, and Germany's motor vehicle and transport giant DAIMLER
BENZ may sign a USD200 million deal for the delivery of modern electrical
locomotives with Polish State Railways (PKP) for the delivery of
electrical locomotives. In September, the Polish Privatisation Ministry
signed an initial agreement with Adtranz on selling 75% of rolling-stock
maker PAFAWAG on the condition that the Polish firm and PKP agree on a
locomotive delivery programme. Under the agreement, Adtranz would pay
USD3.7 million for a stake in ailing Pafawag, bringing modern technology
to Poland's only rolling-stock maker, and invest USD28.1 million over the
next six years. PKP plans to invest 8 billion Zlotys for modernising its
rolling-stock over the next five years.

BRITISH AIRWAYS AND BANQUE RIVAUD TO SAVE AIR LIBERTE

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

BRITISH AIRWAYS, in association with the French RIVAUD group, was
authorised on November 5 to salvage AIR LIBERTE, a French private airline
placed under a legal recovery procedure in September after chalking up
losses of nearly one billion Francs since 1993. Final approval for the
takeover is expected on December 15, following an observation period of 40
days. The two partners plan to inject 630 million Francs into the company,
including 150 to be committed by British Airways. With TAT and Air Liberte
under its belt, BA will control 20% of air traffic flying out of Orly
Airport, and will further increase its influence with the introduction of
new flights and more links to Nice-Toulouse and Bordeaux. BA hopes to have
Air Liberte solvent again within three years. The British plan has gone
down well with Air Liberte's employees, but not with the civilian aircraft
pilots' union, which fears job losses.

The United States Department of Transportation approved, on November 5, a
cooperation alliance between SAS, the Scandinavian airline, and UNITED
AIRLINES of the US. The Department also granted anti-trust immunity to the
three-way SAS-United-LUFTHANSA alliance as part of the open sky Agreement
signed by the US and Germany last Spring. SAS and United Airlines, which
signed a cooperation accord in September 1995, have been jointly offering
66 "code-sharing" transatlantic flights since April.

AIRBUS: HISTORIC DEAL WITH USAIR

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The European consortium Airbus Industrie has made a significant
breakthrough into the world market by winning a contract with USAir, the
United States' fifth largest airline, for a confirmed order of 120
aircraft from the single-corridor family (A319/320/321), a to-be-confirmed
order for 120 others and an option on another 160 aircraft. This
agreement, for which a final contract must still be prepared, is worth
some USD18 billion and constitutes a victory over Boeing, Airbus's main
competitor.

For the past several months, Airbus has been running nearly neck and neck
with Boeing. Last Spring, the European consortium sold 30 A320s to China,
a market until recently dominated by Boeing and its B737. In July, Airbus
won a contract worth USD two billion to sell 45 aircraft to General
Electric's leasing company. Since their introduction in the early 1980s,
1,110 planes from the A319/320/321 family have been sold to 64 airlines
(450 of them to North American customers), of the 2,204 machines that
Airbus has sold worldwide. The diversification of a single type of
aircraft into several versions is a concept that appeals to airlines, as
it allows them to achieve operational economies. The same pilot is
qualified to fly all three aircraft, which have identical cockpits, and
maintenance, a source of considerable costs, is also similar. During the
first ten months of the year, Airbus captured 42% of the market with 125-
and 350-seat planes, the same range covered by the A319/320/321/330
twin-engine models and the four-engine A340.

AIRPORTS: PANOPLY OF INITIATIVES TO REDUCE NOISE

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

As the European Commission launches an offensive against noise within the
framework of its November 5 Green Paper on this issue (see separate
article in Section III), European airports are up in arms. After British
authorities enacted drastic regulations on London's airports, sparking
protests from airlines, the Italian Environment Ministry introduced a
series of measures aimed at quelling noise around the country's airports
on October 21.

The Italian measures would close airports between midnight and six in the
morning and apply only to civil aviation. The international airports of
Fiumicino in Rome and Malpensa in Milan would remain open, but only for
international flights. This proposed noise reduction Decree would also
change certain flight paths, institute a noise inspection for each
aircraft every two years and require airport management companies to
present a noise reduction plan to municipalities affected by their
activities. Companies that break the rules will be fined two million Lire
for violations during the day, five million for excessive night noise and
seven million for nocturnal landings at international airports. A second
Decree concerns urban development in the areas surrounding airports and
would prohibit the construction of housing where noise exceeds 65 decibels.

IATA protests against British measures.

The anti-noise regulations published by the British Government last Summer
sets maximum noise levels for aircraft taking off from Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted at three decibels below international standards, effective
January 1, 1997. More frequent inspections and heavy fines for violators
are also provided for. The International Air Transport Association (IATA)
is opposed to the regulations, "the main impact of which will be to
penalise all airlines, including those with the most modern aircraft".
Parallel to its General Assembly in Geneva, the Association decided to
initiate legal proceedings against the British Government's Decree. The
new standards, which would be the strictest in the world, according to the
IATA, would prevent companies from using their planes at full capacity and
penalise even those most concerned about the environment.

OPEN SKIES STILL OVER THE HORIZON

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

Meeting in Geneva on November 4 and 5, the member companies of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) observed that their numbers
include both supporters and opponents of worldwide deregulation. The major
American, European and Asian companies take an ultra-liberal view, while
the smaller companies of the developing world, unsure as to whether they
can survive in an overly competitive environment and desirous of remaining
independent on issues of national sovereignty, have reservations or simply
reject the idea of global liberalisation. While not categorically opposed
to deregulation, some smaller airlines in the European Union wonder how
the process of deregulation, already largely under way within the
Community, can be enlarged to encompass non-European, i.e. American
carriers.

However, the prospect of an open sky between Europe and the United States,
which have similar attitudes to liberalisation, is still apparently some
time off, given the harsh competition on this market of 600 million
travellers, which accounted for more than half of worldwide passenger
traffic in 1995, according to the IATA. The Americans criticised the
subsidies that European carriers receive and the Community regulations
that protect them, while the European Commission's representative accused
American authorities of not considering the liberalisation of its market a
priority.

The 254 member countries of the IATA are expected to achieve record net
profits of USD5.5 billion in 1996, a return rate considered encouraging.
The main reasons are restructuring and reductions in operating costs,
although the rising price of fuel is still a concern. The next General
Assemblies of the IATA will be held in November 1997 in Amman, Jordan, and
in June 1998 in Montreal.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL: WILL THE EUROPEAN UNION JOIN A REVAMPED EUROCONTROL?

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

In the wake of its March White Paper on air traffic control, the European
Commission unveiled a draft brief for the negotiation of Community
membership in Eurocontrol, which is responsible for management of air
traffic in Europe, on November 13, "so that the European sky can be
managed as a common resource, unrestricted by national boundaries".
However, the Community cannot join Eurocontrol unless its current areas of
competence and powers are reformed and enhanced. The Commission is hoping
that the Council of Transport Ministers will reach a common position on
the proposed mandate at its December 12 and 13 meeting. The European Civil
Aviation Conference (ECAC) will issue an opinion on the revision of the
Eurocontrol Convention in February 1997, within the framework of its
INSTAR strategic study.

In a White Paper published on March 6, the Commission discussed the need
to improve European air traffic control and combat growing congestion,
which causes delays and creates additional costs for carriers. The third
option set out in the White Paper, and the Commission's favourite,
provides explicitly for the EU's accession as a full member to a
"reinvented Eurocontrol", to ensure Community competence over air traffic
management and avoid any clash of competence between the two organisations
by allowing the Member States to speak with a single voice. This approach
would separate regulatory tasks (which would be the province of the new
Eurocontrol) and operational activities (the responsibility of the Member
States).

In the draft mandate it tabled on November 13, the Commission defines the
steps it considers necessary to take to implement the recommendations of
the White Paper. But two main elements must still be clarified, i.e. what
additional responsibilities and powers will be conferred upon Eurocontrol
to make the organisation capable of fulfilling its new role, and under
what procedure will the Community become a member of the reformed
organisation? Thinking strategically, the Commission plans to submit its
proposals for the Council's opinion before the end of the year (with a
view to a common position at the Transport Council of December 12 and 13),
to pre-empt any attempt by the 33 member countries of the European Civil
Aviation Conference (ECAC) to reform Eurocontrol without taking account of
the Community position at their Ministerial meeting in February.

Eurocontrol Convention review.

The EU's Transport Ministers must take a position as to whether to grant
the Commission a brief to negotiate with the non-EU members of Eurocontrol
on a revision of the Eurocontrol Convention which would expand the
organisation's role and allow the European Union per se to join. The
mandate is also expected to give the EU the right to vote and thus to
oppose any decision it considers contrary to Community interests.

Two models for Eurocontrol reform.

Meanwhile, the ECAC is working to finalise INSTAR, a strategic study on
the reform of European air traffic control. Although the Commission would
prefer the particular approach mentioned above, the White Paper left the
way open to new discussions with all concerned organisations, including
ECAC. In the intervening months, the two models have converged
significantly, although certain important points, including some related
to the competence of the future Eurocontrol, must still be settled,
including:

* the principle of a separation between regulatory functions and provision
of services;

* proposals concerning management of airspace (the Commission sees the
future Eurocontrol as having responsibility for structuring the European
airspace, defining military zones and flight paths and improving control
in border areas);

* the definition of common objectives for safety services and access to
airspace (which would devolve upon the revamped Eurocontrol under option 3
of the White Paper);

* coordination of technological research and development activities (the
ECAC would like this to be the task of Eurocontrol, while the Commission
would prefer this coordination to take place within the EU's Framework
Programmes for research);

* the creation of financial mechanisms to support common policy on air
traffic control (the Commission considers it important to allow the new
Eurocontrol to fund common initiatives).

Eurocontrol presents annual report for 1995.

In 1995, Eurocontrol had two good reasons to be satisfied with its
performance: on the one hand because it practically completed the third
and final phase of its EATCHIP programme on the harmonisation and
integration of air traffic control, and on the other as the new Central
Flow Management Unit (CFMU) took up its mission to reduce the congestion
of European airspace (becoming fully operational in March 1996).
Eurocontrol currently has 22 member countries: the EU Member States minus
Finland and Spain (accession pending), plus Turkey, Malta, Cyprus,
Hungary, Switzerland, Norway, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Romania
(the accession of Croatia and the Slovak Republic is being formalised).
Eurocontrol also has an important role to play in the management of
European air traffic since, having been recognised as the responsible
authority by a European Parliament Resolution of November 1995, it is now
regarded by the European Commission as having an essential contribution to
make to reforming the management of Europe's skies.

BRITISH AIRWAYS/AMERICAN AIRLINES ALLIANCE ON HOLD

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

A proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, aimed
at establishing the world's largest air transport entity, is conditional
upon a number of decisions. It must be approved by London, Washington and
the European Commission, and its fate is also hinges on the outcome of
open sky pact negotiations between the United States and the UK. The
United States' approval is contingent upon the conclusion of an open sky
Agreement. The approval of the British Government is considered the most
easily overcome regulatory obstacle for BA and American, which are hoping
to get the go-ahead by the end of November. Based on a report by the
Office of Fair Trading, one of the UK's competition authorities, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry could accept the project, subject its
approval to conditions or instigate another phase in the competition
inquiry, by submitting the proposal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.

The resumption of negotiations between the UK and US in Washington on
November 7 and 8 is considered a good omen for the future of British
Airways. Discussions so far have always foundered (on August 27, the
American delegation suspended talks on the ground that British proposals
were inadequate) and experts doubt that the companies will be able to
implement their agreement before the planned date of their alliance in
April 1997. Talks between the two countries could resume at Ministerial
level in early December. The main point of discussion is access for
American carriers to London's airports, including Heathrow. The proposed
BA/AA alliance sparked a strong reaction from USAir, the fifth largest
American company, which criticised a code-sharing agreement with British
Airways in protest.

NEW COMMISSION LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES FOR 1997

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

On October 16, the Commission adopted its work programme for 1997 which it
unveiled to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on October 22. Of the 16
legislative initiatives planned for next year, five directly concern
transport policy. These proposals cover:

* training of safety advisors for road, rail or inland waterway transport
of hazardous goods;

* the composition of boat crews, rest and navigation time;

* the measurement and control of noise in airport zones;

* the granting of certificates to air carriers;

* harmonisation measures necessary for the deployment of telematics in the
area of road transport.

The European Parliament gave the work programme a frosty welcome on
October 22, criticising the Commission for its lack of initiative in
proposing new legislation to an increasingly hostile Council of Ministers.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FAVOURS BUDGET INCREASE FOR TRANSPORT

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The European Parliament proposed, on October 24, an increase of some ECU
800 million to the EU's draft Budget for 1997, over the amount agreed on
by the Council of Ministers in July. The additional funds would be used
for trans-European transport networks and the budget line on transport
policy, in which the Council planned to make severe cuts.

As is its right within the limits of the financial perspective, the
Parliament restored credits that the Council had dropped in July. In the
area of internal policy, the Parliament decided to create a reserve of ECU
300 million, including putting ECU 73 million in a negative reserve to
finance the 14 priority trans-European transport projects. This accounting
trick would allow it to dip into funds from heading 3 during execution of
the Budget. The Parliament also allocated more money to budget lines the
Council had cut, such as the environment, consumer protection, equal
opportunities for men and women, information and communication, the fight
against fraud and transport. Payment appropriations for transport now
total ECU 28.495 million (compared to 27.7 in the Council's proposal), but
remain well below those in the 1996 Budget (30.582 million).

EUROPEAN DIARY

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

* Inauguration of Adtranz Europe: the ABB Daimler-Benz transport group
will officially open its Brussels business centre on November 29 with the
presentation of a study on the development of goods transport in Europe
between 1997 and 2010. The study also include detailed recommendations
concerning the establishment of a pan-European rail system for freight.

Information on intermodal transport will be the theme of a meeting of the
EIA (European Intermodal Association) to be held in Eupen, Belgium, on
November 29. This is the first of a planned series of decentralised
information meetings intended to producers in the intermodal chain into
contact with current and potential users.

EIA, Rue Ravenstein 60, bte 21, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium. Tel: (+32) 2/514

* Increasing Survivability in Aircraft Accidents: the number of aircraft
accidents has dropped over the past 20 years, but this decline has not
been accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the passenger mortality
rate. Out of 1,000 people killed in air crashes, 400 died in accidents
that were "technically survivable". The ETSC (European Transport Safety
Council) is holding a European symposium to discuss improving the survival
rate with impact protection, fire suppression and evacuation procedures at
the Hotel Dorint in Brussels on December 16, with the support of the
European Commission and firms including BP, Ford Europe, 3M Europe, Keymed
and KLM.

INDONESIAN SKIES OPEN

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

JAKARTA - Indonesia has extended a full open skies policy to
Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries in a move
to encourage development in two east Indonesian provinces
Kalimantan and Sulawesi, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Minister of transportation, Mr Haryanto Dhanutirto, told parliament
the facility will cover only point-to-point services and not
stopovers to overseas destinations. Airlines from Brunei, Malaysia
and the Philippines, partners of the East Asia Growth Areas (EAGA),
can now link the major cities in Kalimantan and North Sulawesi.

TOURISM CO-OPERATIVE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong

HONG KONG - Tourism authorities in Hong Kong are strengthening co-
operative marketing promotions with the territory's counterparts in
China.

Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) chairman Mr Lo Yuk Sui said
Pearl River Delta Tourism Marketing Organisation initiatives are
being expanded.

Mr Lo reminded HKTA's annual general meeting of the tourism
industry's role as the second largest foreign exchange earner for
the territory's economy.

He said: "(Hong Kong) is assured of a positive future as China's
most open window on the world. We are now planning to expand our
Pearl River Delta Tourism Marketing Organisation initiative and
will also be co-operating as fully as possible with next year's
'Visit China Year 1997'."

He said joint efforts would be undertaken with the China National
Tourism Administration (CNTA) for exhibition booths, travel trade
shows and promotions of cruise hubs.

Ms Amy Chan, HKTA executive director, expressed confidence that
with verbal reassurances from Chinese officials that visa and
travel policies "should more or less remain the same", the industry
would continue to flourish after the handover next year.

ASIA HAILS NEW LEISURE ALLIANCE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Jeff Zuckerberg

HONG KONG - Executives of Thomas Cook in Asia have welcomed their
company's plans to form what they claim is the world's largest
leisure travel alliance with the giant American Automobile
Association (AAA).

Ms Keller Mak, general manager of Thomas Cook Hong Kong, said:
"This alliance will be a big incentive for people in Hong Kong or
elsewhere in Asia to travel with Thomas Cook when travelling to the
US. And this is a large sector of our business.

"We are leisure travel specialists, with over 30 per cent of our
business being travel to the US."

The alliance - which becomes fully operational on January 1 next
year - provides all leisure travellers who make international
arrangements through AAA access to the Thomas Cook "Worldwide
Customer Promise".

The Worldwide Customer Promise includes the following no-fee
services for holidaymakers: airline reservation changes, ticket
revalidation or rerouting, hotel and car rental reservations,
changes to travel arrangements and travel planning; and emergency
local telephone calls.

AAA will provide reciprocal services to Thomas Cook customers in
the US.

In addition to enhanced customer service, the AAA-Thomas Cook
alliance will focus on new technology applications and electronic
distribution.

The first joint project begins in January when AAA joins the
Catalist Trading Exchange.

Catalist is an electronic leisure travel booking system developed
by Thomas Cook, which integrates into AAA's new AVATAR system.

The system allows travel counsellors to create electronically-
customised vacations for independent or group travel.

"AAA's alliance with Thomas Cook allows the association to deliver
unparalleled customer service far beyond its borders," said Mr
Graeme Clarke, senior vice- president, AAA products and services.

"Today's announcement provides AAA members the same level of
security and peace of mind whether they are visiting Boston,
Britain or Beijing."

Future initiatives for the partners will include negotiations with
multinational suppliers and co-operative ventures in foreign
exchange and publishing.

IHA'S SPEARMAN RETIRES TO SPAIN

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE International Hotel Association (IHA) will bid farewell to Mr
Robin Spearman on September 21 when he retires to the Costa Del Sol
in Spain.

Mr Spearman has headed the Hong Kong office of the IHA since it
opened in May 1995.

Mr Andrew Jones, vice-president of human resources at the Marco
Polo Hotel, will take over Mr Spearman's position commencing
October 1.

After 21 years with Hilton International, Mr Spearman came to Hong
Kong in 1989 to head human resources at Holiday Inn Asia Pacific.

It was a very demanding position because with seven hotels in
China, Holiday Inn was hit hard in the aftermath of the Tiananmen
Square incident.

Mr Spearman was responsible for overseeing the evacuation of its
expatriate personnel from China and then subsequently rebuilding
that infrastructure.

While in Hong Kong, he was also chairman of the human resources
committee of the IHA, chairman of the advisory board for Hong Kong
Technical College and a member of the advisory boards for the hotel
programme at the Hong Kong Polytechnic and for PATA.

"I am very sad to be leaving Hong Kong," he said. "There's a family
feeling here in the hotel industry. But I'll be back next year -
either for the Cricket Sixes or for the handover."

Mr Spearman plans to take it easy for the next few months before
possibly teaching at a new hotel school in Spain.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT GROWING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

LICENCE has been awarded to Cantho Tourism and France's Electricite
et Eau de Madagasca for a US$4.2 million joint venture hotel
project in the Mekong Delta town of Cantho.

This will be the second hotel project for the French company, which
recently secured the first licence issued since early 1994 for a
100 per cent foreign-invested hotel project in Sapa.

Also considering investment outside Vietnam's mainstream
destinations is the Malaysian company of Goh Hock Guan, which has
signed an agreement for a US$12 million hotel development in Hoa
Binh.

Goh Hock Guan has, in the past, expressed interest in projects in
both Ha Long Bay and Hue, neither of which has seen any progress,
but Hoa Binh authorities express confidence in the company's
commitment to the Hoa Binh project. The second stage involves
constructing a golf course.

Saigontourist, meanwhile, is seeking foreign investment for a
health and spa resort in the province of Binh Chau.

LAOS CONTINUES TO DEVELOP

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HOTELS are springing up all over Vietnam. Hanoi has 26 hotels under
development, while Ho Chi Minh City has 23. Danang and China Beach
are also sites for new hotel projects.

One of these new hotels has already started accepting bookings for
16 of its eventual 40 rooms.

It is the first foreign joint venture property to be built in the
former French retreat area of Tam Dao, 80km outside Hanoi. Other
hotels that have soft opened are the five-star Hanoi Daewoo and Na
Trang Lodge, the first international standard hotel in Na Trang.

Vietnam already has 26,000 international standard hotel rooms.

About 11,000 of these rooms were supplied by 160 joint ventures.
One of the first joint ventures is the three-star Century Riverside
Hotel Hue, managed by Century International Hotels since 1992.

  Meanwhile, the go-ahead has been given for a US$209 million joint
venture development project on a site overlooking the former US
embassy in central Ho Chi Minh City.

  The Asian Plaza Complex is expected to be completed by the turn
of the century.

CAMBODIANS HOLD TREK TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

OPERATORS hoping to open new destinations in Cambodia's north-
eastern corridor, marketing the allure of untouched hill tribes,
will have to wait say members of Cambodia's travel trade.

Trekking tours to Modulkiri and Ratanakiri might inspire a
pioneering spirit in the hardest of backpackers, but mainstream
travel companies are cautious about the area's immediate potential.

This is in spite of an aggressive stance from Cambodia's Ministry
of Tourism which would like to promote new destinations. Both
provinces were spared during years of conflict, are reportedly free
of mines and offer cross border opportunities for selling packages
into northern Vietnam.

"We've seen the success of eco-tourism in neighbouring countries
and now we want to promote the natural, cultural and environmental
advantages in these areas," said under-secretary of state for
tourism, Mr Sok Chenda Sopea.

Local tour operators remain indifferent about sending clients to
destinations off Cambodia's beaten track.

"It is often mentioned but it is not ready for groups,' said Ms
Nongnuj Dobbs, Phnom Penh office manager for East-West Cambodia.

Lack of infrastructure, and only four weekly flights by Royal Air
Cambodge limit short-term development potential.

VIETNAM: AIRPORT INVESTMENT GROWING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

A RENOVATED domestic arrivals hall has opened at Hanoi's Noi Bai
International Airport and work is underway on a new US$60 million
terminal building, scheduled for completion by end 1997.

Doubts have been raised over expected Japanese involvement in the
project, and a Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV)
official said the government will finance the initial stages.

An agreement has been signed with the German firm, Thyssen, for the
supply and installation of terminal equipment. Under the deal, a
loan of about US$17 million will be provided.

Meanwhile, in Ho Chi Minh City, five foreign firms are competing
for investment in a new terminal building for Tan Son Nhat
International Airport. The building will allow Vietnam's main
gateway to be upgraded to an eight million-pax capacity.

Sources have suggested that departure taxes are likely to be raised
at both airports to cover costs.

And Royal Brunei Airlines has begun its twice-weekly Boeing 747
service between Myanmar and London.

The flights leave Brunei on Mondays and Thursdays and stop over in
Yangon and Abu Dhabi before proceeding to London's Heathrow
airport.

COMFORTABLE CHAOS IN HANOI

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AN oasis of green-shuttered calm, a city of enchanting lakes and
crumbling French architecture, the refined older sister to an
explosive young Ho Chi Minh City - these are some of the images of
Hanoi trotted out by Vietnam guidebooks.

You should not believe it. From the vantage point of a cyclo
(rickshaw) tour through Hanoi's ancient quarters, it was clear to
me that Vietnam's capital is anything but peaceful. Life is lived
out at full throttle as motorcycles seem to hoot their way not just
around you, but over and under you, in their impatience to get on
with life.

I had insisted we travel only by the ubiquitous cyclo - still a
leading form of transport outside Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. But I
hadn't bargained for the aftermath of typhoons Frankie and Nicki,
which left me knee-deep in water before I had even reached the
rendezvous.

When I finally arrived, my guide, Mr Hieu, was all smiles - and so
was I when I found he had lined up a car as well as a couple of
cyclos for us.

First stop for visitors to Hanoi is usually the Ho Chi Minh
Mausoleum, a fascinating if somewhat eerie monument housing the
embalmed body of the former leader affectionately known as Uncle
Ho.

It was Thursday and the mausoleum was closed. We headed instead to
the modernist, Russian-built Ho Chi Minh Museum for a quick tour of
the former leader's life. The exhibits are interesting but the
English language is scarce so a guide is much needed.

Next stop was the One Pillar Pagoda where we interrupted
preparations for a ceremony honouring a leading monk who had
recently died. Later we saw the charming Tran Quoc Pagoda
overlooking West Lake and the White Horse Pagoda where a white-
bearded monk talked about travel writer Barbara Cohen.

Hanoi's French quarter - walled colonial villas in wide tree-lined
boulevards - was seen from the comfort of the car en route to the
Temple of Literature, an 11th century centre of learning where Mr
Hieu pointed out the faint etchings on stone tablets that list each
year's three most outstanding scholars.

We were plunged from this scene of erudition into living Hanoi a
few minutes later, as we eased ourselves in cyclos and bumped and
swerved our way around the Water Tower, past half-hidden pagodas
and through the 36 narrow streets that make up the old quarter -
Silk Street, Herb Street, Steel Street and Flower Street.

Silk Street is the heart of Hanoi's tourist district and, according
to Mr Hieu, the owners of the yellow and green shophouses are
prosperous enough to own a second family home in other areas of
Hanoi where space and water are in better supply.

Beyond Silk Street, however, and we were passing family rattan
factories and wizened old women with blackened teeth selling
obscure cigarettes for a few cents each.

Proprietors here have not fared as well. Life is traditional,
fascinating and raw. This part of Hanoi will not live out economic
reforms.

This tour was arranged by Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh City, tel:
(844) 826-4154. Similar tours are available on request from most
tourism companies. Scheduled tours can be picked up at the city's
backpacker cafes.

A DESTINATION WITH AUTHENTICITY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AGAINST a spectacular backdrop of silver-scarred mountains and
descending fog, a group of foreign tourists sit in a wooden hut.
They are offered bitter tea by a barefoot hostess clad in
embroidered scarlet, huge silver earrings hanging from her ear
lobes.

She belongs to one of the 60-odd ethnic minority groups based in
Vietnam's central highlands and mountainous north. Closely linked
to the Thai hilltribes, some of these groups have lived in Vietnam
for hundreds of years, others for thousands.

Virtually all retain a traditional lifestyle yet to be eased by
such conveniences as electricity and potable tap water.

The foreign tourists, meanwhile, form part of a growing group of
not-so-young visitors to Vietnam, willing to trek considerable
distances from base camps at places such as Sapa, Hoa Binh or Mai
Chau and to temporarily forego modern comforts for the chance to
get firsthand experience of the ethnic minority lifestyle before
the area becomes over-trekked.

Saigontourist, Ben Thanh Tourist, Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh City
and other leading tour operators offer trips around central or
northern Vietnam which include between two and five days of walking
and one or two overnight stays in ethnic villages.

While such tours are not a priority on the Vietnam National
Administration of Tourism's (VNAT) agenda, they nonetheless fit in
nicely with the image the NTO is trying to promote - as a rich
cultural destination.

"Cultural tourism" is the buzzword in industry circles and although
definitions are understandably soft, it is perceived as
educational, relatively environmentally friendly, and non-intrusive
for the host country.

More importantly, it addresses growing concerns shared by other
emerging destinations about the possible loss of Vietnam's cultural
identity in the face of increasing numbers of foreign visitors
touring more diverse destinations.

Explained Mr Do Quang Trung, chairman of the VNAT: "We are trying
to preserve our cultural and ecological environment and at the same
time promote tourism, which is a difficult task.

"I think we need to focus more on introducing our culture to
foreign visitors for this."

The idea of cultural tourism is not new and Vietnamese tour
operators are fired up by the idea of boosting cultural interest.

Said Mr Nguyen Van Nhi, general director of Vietnamtourism Ho Chi
Minh City: "We need to learn from other countries on how to
preserve the unique features of our country.

"We also need to create a more interesting product for tourists,
take them into the rural countryside, fruit gardens and pottery
villages.

"Or maybe take them into small family homes so they can see what a
family altar is like, rather than just be told.

"Basically we need to increase the cultural interest of tours in
Vietnam, not just in obvious ways.

"Culture influences so much, down to the way we arrange our
belongings in our houses. We need to create a specifically
Vietnamese product that is to do with history and culture.

"I believe that this is what people really want.

"Vietnamese, for example, are very interested in American culture,
and I am sure it works the other way too."

The new emphasis on culture - both popular and refined - is making
its way into tour programmes with Saigontourist now incorporating
farm visits in its Mekong Delta tours.

Conservationists in the former imperial capital of Hue are planning
authentic arts performances in the former Royal Theatre when
restoration work is finished next year.

It is also matched by a national enthusiasm for architectural
conservation that is applauded by most but has caused havoc for
developers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Sadly, few believe such enthusiasm is enough.

HONG KONG: CRUISE POTENTIAL HAMPERED BY FACILITIES

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AMAGINE a Hong Kong-based tour operator offering two- to three-
night cruises into southern China, passing through old villages,
visiting ethnic communities and historic sights, and seeing the new
houses of rich Chinese who have returned after making money in
Hawaii.

After the cruise, passengers would have the option of a train
connection across the Thai border and down all the way into
Malaysia.

Or, with the generating interest in eco-tourism, take a cruise to a
stalagmite colony in coral under the waters near Sai Kung and west
of Tun Mun.

These are potential new cruise opportunities which 26-year tourism
industry veteran, Mr Edmund Tsang, sees as future possibilities for
Hong Kong's cruise tour industry.

Mr Tsang, who joined Watertours of Hong Kong in January this year
as general manager, is deputy chairman of the Travel Industry
Council of Hong Kong. While he has an interest in promoting the
products of his own company, he has a broad perspective on the
cruise industry, having served on the boards of a string of travel
trade associations.

Watertours of Hong Kong, the largest of the local cruise tour
operators, handled about 130,000 passengers last year. Mr Tsang
predicts a modest 15 to 20 per cent increase in the business in the
next few years, but growth, he believes, will be contingent on the
government's willingness to improve and increase the number of
berthing facilities.

"Right now, part of the harbour is a bit discouraging because of
the choppy waters caused by high-speed water traffic," he said.

"There is no real concern by the government for those who love
boating.

"With many people trying to board private and corporate vessels at
the same time, the tour operators are loading at Queen's pier and
the Kowloon public pier.

"The situation is jammed."

The Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) among others, is
advocating that a new international passenger terminal be built,
perhaps at the present Kai Tak site.

Mr Tsang would like to see this also used as a boarding place for
local boating.

He has recommended to the government that other new boarding areas
for pleasure junks and tour operators be located in different parts
of Hong Kong, closer to where people live, such as at Tun Mun or
Kwun Tong.

His interest is not just in the overseas market, but also local
residents, partly because the expanding market of visitors from
China rely on Hong Kong relatives to guide and accompany them on
local sight-seeing tours.

Boarding points have to be conveniently located, and tours suitably
priced and promoted, for local people to think of taking their
China relatives on a trip.

Mr Tsang wants to see tours such as those to Lei Yue Mun and Lamma
Island marketed to Asian visitors not only as a seafood-eating
opportunity, but also as a chance to worship at the old temples in
the area.

On Lamma, he sees there are opportunities for Chinese and other
visitors to have a drink in the bars with the established
expatriate community, to talk to them and find out why they enjoy
the simpler style of life they have chosen in Hong Kong.

Mr Tsang notes that the water cruise business has adapted over the
years to accommodate the different interests of tourists as the
market changes and grows more sophisticated.

"In recent years, Asians have dominated the market. Many,
especially young Asians, are western-educated and are interested in
the cultural and historical side of Hong Kong.

"They are interested in seeing Po Lin Monastery on Lantau.

"The elderly don't tend to have this interest. They want to
concentrate on shopping.

"But younger Japanese, Malaysians and Singaporeans in particular
want to do what the European tourists do.

"They are likely to have afternoon tea at the Peninsula and travel
on the same boat as Europeans."

HONG KONG: THEME PARK IDEA TAKING OFF

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) has given a working title
to its plans to host a massive fair at the end of the century on
the runway at Kai Tak airport.

  Mr Mason Hung, the senior manager for product development at the
HKTA, said there would be so many millennium fairs around the world
that it had been provisionally decided to call Hong Kong's event an
exposition to set it apart from the rest.

  Plans for the Hong Kong Exposition are now being put to a
feasibility test, but could include a major business and trade
event.

  There could also be a permanent theme park on the huge site,
which will become available once the airport is relocated to Chek
Lap Kok in 1998.

HONG KONG: GOING TO WATER FOR HANDOVER

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AFTER 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong returns to China on June
30 next year. Inbound tourist operators are advising clients not to
visit during the week of the handover - unless they have a special
interest in politics and already have accommodation confirmed.

Plans for the official change of sovereignty ceremony on June 30
and the celebrations on July 1 are expected to be announced at the
end of September. But a mascot for the celebrations has already
been chosen. The Preparatory Committee - the body appointed by
China to prepare for the new Special Administrative Region - has
selected the dolphin as the celebration mascot.

The dolphin may seem a strange choice, considering Hong Kong is not
usually associated with these animals.

However, a rare white (or pink) dolphin (sousa chinensis) is native
to Hong Kong, it can still be seen in the waters north of Lantau
Island, in the same area where the new Chek Lap Kok airport is
being built.

If there is irony in choosing an endangered animal as the handover
mascot, the Preparatory Committee seems to have missed it.

Seeing Hong Kong's dolphins in the wild is the latest tourist
attraction being marketed to international visitors by the Hong
Kong Tourist Association (HKTA). Two cruises are available,
organised by Hong Kong Dolphinwatch, a small, independent eco-
tourism operation.

Another new special interest cruise, the New Airport Tour, has been
developed by the HKTA for aviation enthusiasts and those interested
in the massive new airport construction.

The tour takes passengers into roughly the same waters as Hong Kong
Dolphinwatch, passing under the nearly completed Tsing Ma Bridge
and around to the north side of Lantau.

A land section of the tour visits the old Kowloon Walled City site,
now a park, where jets can be seen flying low over the tops of
buildings, then to Lung Cheung Lookout where aircraft are viewed
landing and taking off from the Kai Tak runway.

Before boarding the boat, tourists are taken to the Chek Lap Kok
Airport Core Programme Exhibition Centre.

Watertours of Hong Kong is among those operators which will
organise the New Airport Tour on request for special groups.

Other new or improved water tours have added to Hong Kong's cruise
options.

While visitors can still enjoy Pearl of the Orient harbour cruises
by day or night, they can now spend more time exploring the 235
islands which surround Hong Kong.

Lantau Island is particularly favoured by the tour operators,
partly because it is a tranquil green contrast to Hong Kong, but
mainly because of the popularity of the Giant Buddha at Po Lin
Monastery and Tai O fishing village.

Both Watertours and HYFCO Travel Agency offer cruises to Lantau,
but Watertours has recently extended its Lantau trip to give people
the option of an overnight stay on the island.

Mr Edmund Tsang, general manager of Watertours, says that in the
past people visiting Lantau and Cheung Chau have asked to spend
more time looking around the island.

To meet the demand, he has modified two cruises. The Cheung Chau
Island Hopping Tour now enables passengers to spend 90 minutes
visiting the beach and historic sites on Cheung Chau, as compared
with just 40 minutes in the past, and gives people the option to
hop across to Lantau Island

On the "Romantic Lantau" trip, tourists can elect to stay a night
at Lantau's Silvermine Bay Hotel or hop across to Cheung Chau
Island.

Watertours also offers tailor-made cruises for groups. These
include trips to Lamma Island for hiking and a seafood dinner,
treasure hunt expeditions to the old pirate haunt on Cheung Chau,
and tours which couple inspections of the new airport
infrastructure with archaeological sites.

The cost of the New Airport Tour depends on group size and
itinerary. Watertours' Cheung Chau Island trip (without the Lantau
add on) is HK$310 (US$40).

The Lantau tour, without an overnight stay is HK$465 for adults,
including lunch. With an overnight stay, prices start at HK$850.

Visitors who prefer a little adventure and independence can
formulate their own itinerary and visit the islands for a fraction
of the organised tour prices.

HONG KONG: NEW PARK PLANS CONSIDERED

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AN exhibition and observation centre is being planned as a possible
addition to a new theme park in Hong Kong.

Ma Wan island is the site proposed for a theme park presenting the
history of Hong Kong and a south China fishing village. The island
is likely to be selected as the locale for a "film city" project
intended to be an Asian Universal Studios.

Ma Wan island is the location of one end of the Tsing Ma Bridge,
the world's longest suspension bridge built as part of the traffic
infrastructure for the new airport.

The Hong Kong Tourist Association is embarking on feasibility
studies and is in discussion with the Hong Kong government about
the various plans.

An option is to incorporate a site at Wok Tai Wan, providing an
observation point for one of Hong Kong's newest landmarks.

Meanwhile, Pearl of the Orient has two new destinations combining
Lantau Island and Tsing Ma Bridge. From Victoria Harbour, visitors
can visit the Po Lin Monastery and the Buddha on Lantau Island.

The Tsing Ma Bridge is the major sightseeing point during the trip.

HONG KONG: A BACK-FLIP ON ECO-TOURISM

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

IT is an extraordinary sight. On the edge of the dusty, flattened
tract of reclaimed land soon to become Hong Kong's new airport
runway, eight or nine curious dolphins surfaced by our boat.

Children and adults alike, poised with binoculars and cameras said
in chorus: "Wah! There they are again!"

I saw a six-year-old boy look at his father and exclaim: "It's even
better than the fireworks at Chinese New Year".

Environmentalist Mr Bill Leverett has been taking Hong Kong
residents on cruises around the north of Lantau island to see the
dolphins since March 1995. Only recently, with the help of the Hong
Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), has he begun marketing his tours
to international visitors.

"I wanted to raise awareness of the plight of the pink dolphins,
give them an economic value by helping them contribute to the
tourist economy, and generate revenue for research and campaigns,"
he said.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch is one of the territory's few attempts at
eco-tourism. Passengers learn about the dolphin, how they are
endangered, and what can be done to help protect the marine
environment.

I was astonished that, while the dolphins are threatened by loss of
food, overfishing, pollution and boat traffic, Hong Kong
Dolphinwatch has about a 98 per cent success rate in sighting some
of the 80 to 200 dolphins which live in the area,

In less than 18 months, Hong Kong Dolphinwatch has taken about
3,500 people on dolphin-spotting trips.

There are two versions of the tour.

The one I took runs on Wednesdays, beginning with a 10.00 pick-up
at Queen's Pier, Central, and by the Star Ferry Pier in Tsim Sha
Tsui.

The comfortable pleasure cruise motored across the harbour under
the new Tsing Ma suspension bridge, then meandered slowly through
the waters near Chek Lap Kok on the lookout for the dolphins.

We sighted our first dolphin within a couple of hours of leaving
Central. We saw them in twos and threes at regular intervals, some
bone porcelain white, others a pinky colour.

After a large hot buffet lunch served on board, the boat was
surrounded by eight or nine dolphins.

On Sundays, the trip gives passengers more time near the dolphins,
with less time on the boat.

The weekend takes passengers from Tsim Sha Tsui by coach to Tuen
Mun, where a larger boat waits. Lunch is served at Tai O, the old
fishing village and tourist attraction on the north shore of
Lantau.

The tour costs HK$400 (US$52) per adult and HK$200 for children.

Mr Leverett contributes 10 per cent of proceeds from his cruises to
Hong Kong's Friends of the Earth Water Action Group.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch also sells dolphin-related merchandise such
as tee-shirts, postcards and books.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch can be contacted at tel: (852) 2984-1414,
fax: 2984-7799 and it can also be E-Mail: at dolphins@hk.super.net.

DEVELOPMENT PUSH FOR LANTAU

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE first thing most visitors to Hong Kong see as their aircraft
swings over the new Chek Lap Kok airport development is the Giant
Buddha on Lantau Island.

Most see no more of the Buddha or Lantau, but those who take the
time to explore this island and stay longer than the standard
organised day tour are generally rewarded with an experience of
Hong Kong beyond the cliches of tourist brochures.

Lantau is twice the size of Hong Kong Island. At present, only
eight per cent of all visitors to Hong Kong - and 18 per cent of
visitors from mainland China (now Hong Kong's largest and fastest
growing visitor market) - take a trip to Lantau. Most of these
visitors see little more than the Giant Buddha at Po Lin Monastery
and Tai O fishing village.

The Hong Kong Tourist Association's (HKTA) major Visitor and
Tourism Study (Vistour), which outlines the NTO's strategies for
the future of tourism in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, recommends the south-west part of Lantau be officially
classified as "Leisure Island".

The study recognises the appeal of the island's mountain scenery,
attractive coastal areas and its open environment. It also notes
that accessibility to Lantau is about to be radically altered by
the creation of new infrastructure serving the airport on its north
side which will link the island by rail and road to Kowloon and
Hong Kong.

Fortunately for Lantau, and the quality of life of Hong Kong
residents who enjoy the island on weekends, the HKTA does not
recommend all out tourist development. It recognises that there is
a fine line between giving the greatest number of people access to
the island and retaining the tranquil, green environment which is
central to the island's appeal.

Plans for the island include a cable car link between the township
of Tung Chung - formerly a small, remote fishing village on the
north side of the island which has grown in the past couple of
years into a thriving settlement servicing the airport construction
teams - to Ngong Ping (Lantau Peak).

 The project, which would be relatively inoffensive to the natural
environment, would enable easier access to the Giant Buddha and the
surrounding country park trails.

The government says it will not develop the present one-lane road
connecting Tung Chung with the southern part of the island.

The HKTA notes the increased number of people likely to use
Lantau's country parks and landscape protection areas would need to
be monitored.

"Any new development would need to be very carefully considered and
sited," the Vistour study said.

Nonetheless, the HKTA does propose a resort-style hotel near Po Lin
Monastery, possibly in conjunction with a golf course at Tung
Chung.

It is worth discovering Lantau Island, with its ancient forts, old
fishing villages and serene hillsides before the new airport is
completed (due in the first half of 1998) and whatever changes are
due to take place - well thought out or accidental, good or bad -
alter the character of the island and bring it into the 21st
century.

HIGH AIRPORT INVESTMENT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HONG KONG - Asia/Pacific hubs face radical change as extended-range
twinjets allow point-to-point flights to overfly traditional
transfer points, according to a leading regional aviation boss.

Mr John Mok, head of strategic planning for the Airport Authority
of Hong Kong, has predicted "the Asia/Pacific region alone will
need up to US$200 billion in airport infrastructure investment by
2010 to keep pace with traffic growth".

He said high capital costs in Asia/Pacific are a function of high
demand forecasts - 400 million passengers over the next 15 years,
more than half the world's total.

"Asia/Pacific is investing more in the development of its aviation
infrastructure than any other region in the world today," he said.

"However, it is in Asia/ Pacific where the competition for funds to
build a broad spectrum of infrastructure...is also the greatest.

"The potential risk of inadequate funding for airport development
will only grow in the future."

DE LIMA TO CLOSE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

LANGKAWI - De Lima Resort, the island's largest resort, will cease
operations on September 15.

A short statement by its owner, Accruvest Hotel Management, said
that the resort would be closed for "major renovation" and that
future plans were being drawn up.

De Lima Resort, envisioned to be Langkawi's "most affordable
holiday hideaway" comprising 1,500 rooms, is operating only 100
rooms.

Standard and superior rooms have been priced between RM60.50
(US$24) and RM110.

TTG Asia understands that the resort will be closed for more than a
year in view of the extensive renovation works.

In its place will be a four-star hotel based on a Japanese concept.

There are plans to either rebuild or upgrade the chalets and
bungalows, which were built in a record 53 days during phase one of
development in 1992.

Mr Peter Mueller, chief executive officer of Kuala Lumpur-based
Granite Hotels & Resorts (GHR) which manages De Lima Resort, said
the 430 staff would be "terminated" and not retrenched as reported
by some media.

They include Mr Mohanadas Kumaran and Mr Ibrahim Nordin, who were
recently appointed general manager and resident manager
respectively.

Mr Mueller does not foresee any problems relocating the staff to
other hotels, particularly in Langkawi, in view of tight labour
problem that is affecting the whole country.

As for tour agencies such as Sala Tours & Travel Agency who have
made bookings earlier with De Lima Resort and prepaid them, these
bookings will be upgraded to the five-star sister property
Langasuka Resort's (LR) deluxe rooms and above.

A deluxe room at LR costs RM165.

HOTELS FEAR PHONE SURCHARGE CUT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Virginia Saunders

JAKARTA - Hoteliers fear telephone surcharges are to be cut to keep
pace with Singapore's move to lower telecommunications charges.

Surcharges in Singapore hotels will be cut to S$0.30 (US$0.21) for
each direct call or fax to Malaysia from January. Current
surcharges in Indonesia range from 25 to 50 per cent

Concern has been heightened after a ministerial decree increased
rates on international long distance telephone calls from Batam to
Singapore.

The new Indonesian rate from September 1 increased Batam to
Singapore calls to Rp1,300 a minute (US$0.52) from Rp1,000. Outside
Batam, the calling rate to Singapore from any point in Indonesia is
Rp2,600 per minute. Calls from Singapore to Batam are S$0.50 per
minute, and S$1.80 per minute to other points in Indonesia.

The new rate and the current surcharges make calls from Indonesian
hotels one of the most expensive within the ASEAN region. Although
there are discounted hours, the state-owned domestic
telecommunications provider, PT Telkom, has changed the period when
50 and 75 per cent discounts apply on long distance calls.

Telkom offers 50 per cent discount on long distance calls between
18.00 and 21.00.

Discounted calls of 75 per cent have been moved from 21.00-06.00 to
23.00-08.00. Hotel surcharges are 25 per cent to 50 per cent more
than the normal rate for long distance calls.

PT Telkom said the decision to change was caused by a strong demand
for long distance calls after 21.00, which has "surpassed the
capacity of Telkom network facilities".

Long distance calls from 06.00-09.00 and from 15.00-18.00 are
subject to normal tariffs.

In 1994, Casa Grande, a group of Jakarta hoteliers, was able to
defer a plan by the ministry of telecommunications to regulate
surcharges on phone calls at a lower rate than that imposed by
hotels.

Most Jakarta hotels levy a surcharge of 45 to 50 per cent while
other provinces, including Bali, add 25 per to all hotel calls.

Jakarta hoteliers said they have not received any complaints from
guests over the surcharges. However, with the increase in telephone
rates and with surcharges being arbitrary, hoteliers are concerned
that they may be asked to reduce their surcharges to make doing
business in Indonesia more competitive.

One hotelier told TTG Asia calls from Singapore have been reduced
to a bare minimum "because they feel it will attract the MICE
market, now that there is a decline in tourist arrivals to
Singapore".

IBM TRAVEL SOFTWARE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

IBM has announced plans to develop software for SABRE Business
Travel Solutions (BTS). SABRE BTS is a new corporate software suite
that provides travel booking, travel policy, expense reporting and
decision management tools.

IBM is developing a Lotus Notes version which, the IT giant says,
will work seamlessly with other components of the SABRE BTS system.

"Our work with IBM will help establish SABRE BTS as one of the most
versatile platforms for corporate travel management today,
supporting Windows, Intranet and soon, Lotus Notes," said Mr Sam
Gilliland, vice-president and general manager of SABRE BTS in the
US.

IBM is also planning to incorporate its NEDS Electronic Expense
Report solution with SABRE BTS. IBM expects to capitalise on the
travel and credit card data contained within the SABRE BTS system
to further simplify the expense reporting process for corporate
travellers.

INTER-CONTINENTAL GOES ON-LINE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

ON-LINE bookings for Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts worldwide
can now be made via the chain's site on Travel Web.

But, Inter-Continental says, this will not replace travel agents.

"Introducing on-line reservations via Travel Web shows we see the
Internet as significant technology for the 21st century, but it
does not mean we will see our travel agents as any less important,"
said Mr Michael Stajdel, senior vice-president of marketing and
strategic planning, Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts.

"Travel agents will now be able to have a one-stop shop from (our)
site. (They can) book a hotel, check airline schedules, offer ideas
of what to do in the destination, check the latest weather, and
print their clients a copy to take away."

NEW CYBERNOMICS THREAT TO TRAVEL AGENTS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

CYBERNOMICS - the convergence of technical and economic
undercurrents - is changing the way the travel industry does
business and, in the process, threatening the livelihood of travel
agents," cautions Mr Chris Lyle, chief of the economics and
statistics branch of the International Civil Aviation Organisation
(ICAO).

The costs to air carriers of using a CRS as a distribution channel
have come into the limelight recently. Cost levels are increasing,
and new forms of charges such as cancellation fees have arisen.

"Due to the economic undercurrents, airlines, hotels and other
travel service companies will choose to have fewer travel agents,
pay less commissions and move towards greater direct sales through
various automation options.

"Technology is increasing the capability for leaving the travel
agent - and even the CRS - out of the distribution chain entirely,"
Mr Lyle said.

For example, the method of selling airline tickets - through a CRS
or on-line service - is changing.

Airlines such as Lufthansa - which is using CD-ROMs - and Alitalia,
British Airways/ USAir, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Swissair and
United - which use diskettes - are either giving access to a CRS
via an airline server or direct access to the airline's individual
reservation system.

On the hotel side, Hilton is now distributing CD-ROMs to facilitate
Internet booking.

"Next, you have the recent substantive entrances into marketing
through World Wide Web sites on the Internet, as well as by many
other travel services.

"Currently, more than 100 major airlines from 62 countries have Web
sites. Further, US-based airlines have responded to the economic
undercurrents by placing a commission cap on domestic fares," said
Mr Lyle.

"After considerable initial fuss, the concept now seems to have
taken a firm foothold in the US. The first year of the cap is
reported to have produced an improvement in the bottom line of US
airlines to the tune of about US$400 million, no significant change
in market share between airlines imposing the cap and other
airlines, and a significant but not earth-shattering increase in
the number of closings of travel agents."

Not surprisingly, therefore, airlines outside the US are
considering similar action. More than one European airline is
reducing overrides and incentive payments.

Lufthansa has already announced it will be reducing basic levels of
commission where electronic ticketing is concerned. SAS has
effectively reduced commission via the SAS Travel Plan, a form of
electronic season pass, and start-up carrier EasyJet in Europe
appears to be taking the ValuJet approach to commissions, that is,
avoiding them if possible.

Another quirk in the commission structure is that at least one
airline in the US is now offering a bigger commission for booking
outside a CRS than when using a CRS.

While the CRS will stay in a focal role for some time, Mr Lyle
believes there will be a greater use of other travel distribution
channels that are now becoming available along with greater
interaction amongst these channels.

"One particular benefit of the evolution of new distribution
channels, notably the Internet, has been to sharpen the competitive
edge of the incumbents and the CRS."

Are we seeing the beginning of the end of the travel agent? Mr Lyle
thinks this seems unlikely.

"First, travel agents provide a much broader and often much more
personalised service to passengers than the airlines do directly.

"They are not tied to an individual supplier and offer expert (and
hopefully impartial) advice on different carriers, fares and
routings, different hotels and different car hire companies, just
to name a few products, and agents can themselves offer benefits.
For example, a franchising chain already has a frequent traveller
award programme.

"Second, sonic travel agency chains have major purchasing power and
are able to negotiate private fares with the airlines, passing on
at least some of the savings to their clients.

"They are acting as consolidators as well as agents. Thus, there is
no reason why a travel agent cannot make greater use of the
Internet to serve these clients."

Consequently, while there is likely to be some sort of shake-out,
coupled with more intensive consolidation into consortia or
franchising networks, travel agents appear to be here to stay
because of the value-added services they provide.

"However, the surviving agent will be aggressively automated, in a
niche market or part of a chain, and, most importantly, client
driven," said Mr Lyle.

NEW LIFE TO EVENT WHICH MAINTAINS ITS INTEGRITY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

PATA's recent acquisition of VUSAMART, a three-day fair for North
American inbound traffic from September 9-12, gave new life to the
event's educational dimension but kept its original integrity of a
"business marketplace" intact, said show founder and PATA director
for the Americas, Mr Richard Valerio.

"When you have an organisation with one mind running it, mine,
there's always a limit," Mr Valerio told TTG Asia.

PATA broadens the event's educational scope and educates the
American market on Asia/Pacific trends before it is too late, he
said, citing a speech during the PATA marketing conference on the
growing economies and travel patterns of the Asia/Pacific.

"Now we have people who can deliver a real message, something
people can chew on," he said.

Mr Bill Hastings, PATA director-communications, added: "PATA brings
a global creditability, certainly a high level with Asians and
provides us with more opportunities (with companies) who have been
traditionally outbound operators in the Pacific Asia."

The reality is Asians like big cities, but new niche markets of
younger travellers are emerging, said Mr Valerio.

In October, he and PATA president and CEO, Mr Lakshman Ratnapala,
are meeting the Mexican minister of tourism to discuss ways to
develop infrastructure and marketing capabilities suited to the
Asia/Pacific region.

Travel to South America remains limited due in part to a lack of
air lift.

Mr Valerio has met industry leaders in Brazil, Argentina and Chile
to discuss ways forward.

MYSTERY OF ABSENT FRIENDS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

Travel planners from Australia, New Zealand and India were not to
be found in the halls of the Walt Disney World Resort convention
hall at this year's 11th annual VUSAMART.

Australia and New Zealand, invited for the first time this year,
were not in participation possibly due to short notice.

Mr Richard Valerio, PATA director for the Americas, began talking
with their national carriers in January to assist him in
identifying qualified companies.

India's absence, on the other hand, remains a mystery.

In 1994, one Indian company attended, followed by an additional
three last year. This year, not one graced the theme park city of
Orlando.

"Why not here? I wish I had the answer. Hopefully the Indian press
will take 'em and shake 'em," said Mr Valerio.

He remained optimistic of the nation's potential as an inbound
market to North America. "The India market is certain to explode
and when they're ready, we'll be ready."

SPOTLIGHT ON USTTA OPTIONS

THE American government and private sector are looking at a number
of options following the demise of the United States Travel and
Tourism Association (USTTA), the country's national tourism
organisation, earlier this year.

One proposal is for a council along the lines of a privately-funded
NTO, said PATA director for the Americas, Mr Richard Valerio.

If approved, its establishment is still not expected for a further
two years.

PRAISE FOR TWO-WAY TOURISM

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

PATA officials defended the association's so-called "two-way
tourism" policy against criticism this year from those who
questioned whether it was an appropriate activity.

"Two-way tourism is an evolutionary process which some people have
been ignoring," said Mr Richard Valerio, PATA director for the
Americas.

"If we are suggesting to be a global society, you can't expect an
association to be isolated. The voice of the Pacific is not only
one-way."

Reaction to PATA's promotion of two-way tourism has been positive,
but some who have disagreed have spoken loudly and attracted
attention, said PATA director of communications, Mr Bill Hastings.

PATA's charter is to promote travel to and within Pacific Asia and
certainly the North America continent is within the PATA region, Mr
Hastings told TTG Asia, pulling out a PATA brochure with the North
American continent, including Canada, the US and Mexico clearly in
view.

"Unless we adjust to the change in the marketplace, we are not
providing the services we are here for."

ASIAN MARKETS POSE A CHALLENGE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

North Americans at the PATA marketing conference on September 10
were told Asian markets are complex and the US faces competition
with attractive Asian destinations.

In his "Marketing Segmentation in Asia" presentation, Mr Brian
Deeson, president and CEO of Century International Hotels in Hong
Kong, selected five "lesser-known" Asian countries, including
India, Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, to highlight as
examples of complexity.

He said: "Travel patterns are like ripples on a pond. People tend
to travel firstly within a very small radius from their own home
and then to increasingly remoter destinations as their
sophistication and spending capability increases.

"This means that by the time an Asian traveller hits North America,
he or she has probably already had several trips within Asia and
therefore, in relative terms, is quite a sophisticated traveller."

On India, a vast country frequently overlooked by its Asian
neighbours, Mr Deeson noted: "There are an estimated 300 million
Indians who could be classified as middleclass and thus have the
ability to travel outside the country as their lifestyles improve.
The market potential is therefore enormous."

Indian expenditure first goes to appliances, then cars and thirdly
travel, he said, adding that the greatest hindrance to increased
overseas travel has been a lack of international connections.

Mr Deeson was upbeat on "the recommencement of around-the-world
flights by United Airlines, taking in Delhi on a daily basis and
thus linking it to Europe and North America via Hong Kong".

On the Korean market, one of North America's most important in
Asia, Mr Deeson said overseas travel is fashionable and the desire
and means for such a leisure activity is spread throughout the
country.

Prospects for growth are good. The 1996 forecast for departures
varied from 4.2 to 4.5 million and double-digit growth per year
will be sustained until the year 2000.

Travel remains dominated by group tours.

"Korea is only what one operator termed 'flirting' with FIT
travel," he said.

Growth from Singapore, which on a per capita basis has the highest
number of travellers in the world, is expected to reach a plateau
by the turn of the century due to its small population. From 1991
to 1995, the number of visitors to the US grew marginally from
57,000 to 88,000.

"While the overall market will not grow, there are tremendous
opportunities for growing target niche-market segments," noted Mr
Deeson.

Thailand was also highlighted as "one of the more advanced
developing countries in Asia" with a population exceeding 60
million.

Thai traffic to the US doubled from 1991 at 47,000 to 94,000 last
year.

As for Taiwan, similar in some travel habits to Koreans and
Japanese, the over-50 crowd took a million trips abroad in 1994 and
are greatly influenced by what tour operators are featuring.

MIXED VIEWS OVER PULL-OUT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

REACTIONS to the announced pull-out of the Canadian Tourism
Commission from PATA were mixed at the annual VUSAMART.

Mr Randy Ng, manager of Classic Holidays Tour & Travel of
Vancouver, said the decision will have a "spiritual effect" on the
Asian market.

"Before (Tourism Canada was a PATA member), people didn't think
Canada belonged to the Pacific Rim, but with PATA there's a sense
of belonging," Mr Ng told TTG Asia.

"Asians think Canada is cold, in the North Pole. But when with
PATA, they think it's part of the Pacific. It's easier to sell."

Representatives of two other Canadian-based travel companies
believed Tourism Canada paid so little attention to Asian markets
that the move will have virtually no impact.

"The influence will not be that crucial as far as the Asia/ Pacific
market is concerned because most Canadian operators have their own
connections and do their own sales trips," said Ms Cynthia Lau,
deputy general manager of TourLink Holidays, which focuses on the
Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean markets.

She said the national tourist office does not see Thailand and
Malaysia as potential markets, only as a surplus, "something like a
dessert".

Mr Raymond Chu, sales manager of Royal Canadian Travel of Ontario,
whose major market is Thailand, agreed: "Even though they pulled
out of PATA, we still sell to the Orient. We have our own
clientele.

"Those agents don't care if it's PATA or not PATA. As long as you
offer good service and good price, they give you business."

Last month, Tourism Canada announced the NTO was not renewing its
membership of PATA, citing a lack of sufficient benefits.

The organisation has a grace period until July 1, 1997, when
membership fees are due again.

THUMBS UP FOR PATA'S FIRST US FAIR

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

ASIA/Pacific travel buyers expressed general approval for PATA's
first attempt at running VUSAMART.

Mr Warren Ho, director of Ambience Holidays of Singapore, a GSA
operator and wholesaler, said the show was well-organised and
precise.

He said: "Not much time is wasted. We made a few good contacts and
renewed old contacts."

Of the new contacts, Mr Ho met mostly hotel chains and convention
bureaus which are not represented in Singapore.

"It is good to get feedback on how they are operating and it's good
for information gathering."

Ambience Holidays' primary focus is on the main gateways to the US.

Ms Rolland Cheng, a manager at Shangri-La Holidays Travel Lines of
San Francisco, said she had found new products.

As a ground handler of 50,000 to 60,000 people a year mainly from
Taiwan and a few South-east Asian countries, Ms Cheng said her
clients would be interested in Cancun in Mexico, and New Orleans.

"Normally, people stay on the west or east coast, so it's good to
know about these places," she said.

With little first-hand experience in New Orleans, she was
enthusiastic to learn about the casinos there.

Ms Cynthia Lim, senior outbound manager of Ho Wah Genting Travels
of Kuala Lumpur, said most of her previous groups have visited Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas.

But after her first attendance at VUSAMART, she planned to also
promote Orlando and New York. While her clients to California have
seen Disney World and Universal Studios in action, Orlando also
offers Pleasure Island, an attraction she considered to be a hit
with her younger guests.

Although she had spoken with several hotels and ground agents, Ms
Lim was not looking for direct hotel contacts as she brought in
only two to three groups to the US per month and had a ground
handler to make all hotel arrangements.

She will be back next year to follow the trends.

Mr Kim Young-sun, president of The Korea Times Travel of Seoul,
said: "First I'm here to meet old friends, to exchange opinions and
to promote common interests."

Mr Kim was disappointed at not seeing everyone he had hoped would
attend the Orlando event.

CRUISE CALL TO THAILAND

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

BANGKOK - Thailand should develop its cruise industry and create
all-inclusive resort deals if it wants more of the US outbound
market, according to the US travel agents' top official.

American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) president and CEO, Ms
Jeanne Epping, made these observations as ASTA prepared for its
World Congress in Bangkok from October 6-12.

She also noted that the biggest obstacle to overcome for Americans
travelling to Thailand is flight time and cost, although the
country offers some of the region's best prices.

Ms Epping told TTG Asia the Thai government needed "to develop its
cruise industry and encourage more ships to cruise its island and
look to all-inclusive resort pricing in special packages like those
offered by Hawaiian and Caribbean suppliers".

She added: "It should also offer more off-season pricing packages".

If all goes well during the World Congress, she predicted Thailand
could become Asia's top destination for Americans.

ASTA research claims previous host countries have experienced an
increase in arrivals between 10 and 40 per cent after hosting the
congress.

Last year, 328,000 Americans visited Thailand.

SINGAPOREANS GOING FOR ECO-TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Natalie Chen

SINGAPORE - More Singaporeans are opting for eco-adventure tours
with the market for such holidays ready to jump by 50-60 per cent
this year, said Mr Chang Theng Hwee, managing director of Country
Holidays Travel.

He estimated the niche market was still relatively small, making up
less than five per cent of the Singaporean outbound market.

But the Singaporean market for eco-adventure tours is the largest
in South-east Asia due to the population's environmental awareness.

"There are even less operators in this line which allows for our
growth in the local market," said Mr Chang.

Mr Benny Ng, assistant tour manager of Country Holidays Travel,
said the "hip to be green trend" has contributed to the popularity
of tours.

"Most of our clients like to know that their dollars are helping to
save the environment and the local indigenous population," he said.

Mr Chang said eco-adventure tours are a few hundred dollars more
expensive than standard packages.

Popular extras include visiting a private game park and having
meals prepared by their own cooks. The idea of exclusiveness and
hygiene appeal to consumers' tastes and they are prepared to pay
for quality.

Mr Ng said: "For eco-adventure tours, you can't be cheap because it
affects the quality and aim of such travel."

Mr Chang said a key reason for growth was that clients belonged to
the upmarket category.

"Even with the economic slowdown we are not affected because our
clients can afford the tours."

But he said the danger of eco-adventure tours lay in the abuse of
the term. He said: "Anyone can organise an 'eco-adventure' tour but
they may not carry out environmentally friendly practices."

He cited trekkers to the Himalayas, who used firewood instead of
kerosene, hence contributing to deforestation.

AUSTRALIA: SINGLE AIR MARKET GOAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AUCKLAND - Air New Zealand's NZ$544 million (US$370 million) buy
into Ansett Australia will bring the proposed Australasian single
aviation market a step closer to reality, opening up new
opportunities for Asia's travel trade.

Air New Zealand chief executive, Mr Jim McCrea, assuming approval
from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and endorsement
by shareholders at a special meeting on September 27, said: "Once
this investment is made, the governments would then consider their
next step to harmonisation and rationalisation of the current
rules."

Over the past two years, the trans-Tasman aviation market has been
progressively deregulated, although wholly Australian-owned Ansett
New Zealand has been flying domestically in New Zealand since 1987.

Mr McCrea believes the next step is to allow any New Zealand or
Australian carrier to operate freely across the Tasman Sea and
within each other's countries.

"But it's up to the governments to negotiate that arrangement."

Mr McCrea said that as well as sharing in Ansett Australia's
domestic business, Air New Zealand could become involved in
international expansion through Ansett International, which already
flies to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.

He said: "I am delighted. It hasn't sunk in yet. Some of us have
spent...in excess of two years on this thing, every day of the
week.

"It's going to be very, very good for New Zealand and Australia.
It's going to be very, very good for Air New Zealand. And it's
going to be very, very good for Ansett."

It is looking at how it can integrate its fleet with Australian
domestic services and market them together.

ASIANS WOOED WITH OUTBACK DEAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Margie T Logarta

ADELAIDE - South Australia is hoping a unique cultural event will
put it on the tourism map in key Asian markets.

"Opera in the Outback" in the Flinders Ranges from September 18-21
next year may just lure Asians to venture into unknown territory.

The first concert, staged in 1988 to mark Australia's bicentennial,
attracted an audience of 9,300. The latest venture, featuring Dame
Kiri Te Kanawa, is expected to lure 12,500.

Some 2,000 seats have been reserved for international visitors.

The spectacle will be staged in Yalkarinha Gorge, whose magnificent
hills and towering gum trees provide a stunning backdrop.

Next year's presentation has been expanded to include a colourful
range of activities by surrounding communities, including train
rides on the historic Pichi Richi Railway in restored steam
locomotives, rodeos, country music concerts, sheep shearing, native
story-telling, bush tucker meals and open-air vintage theme parties
with live classical quartet.

The only Asians to have travelled through the South Australian
outback have been Japanese in rented cars or motorbikes on their
way to other states.

"They haven't been aware of what they can actually do," said Mr
David Tarr, chairperson, Flinders Ranges and Outback Tourism South
Australia.

He said Opera in the Outback gave Asians the ideal introduction to
an area millions of years old and teeming with incredible wildlife.
"They can see kangaroos, emus, eagles and reptiles while getting a
package which doesn't force them to go out of their safety zone."

Mr Scott Ireland, In Front Management director and ex-Singapore
resident, said although Singaporeans remained fascinated by Sydney
and the Gold Coast, a small but increasing number were realising
there was more to Australia than cities and beaches.

"If you were to combine an interesting cultural product, a bit of
wilderness, a bit of cold weather and lots of hands-on options,
then South Australia offers great potential," he said.

The Opera in the Outback packages start from A$360 (US$290) to
A$690.

LAOS' TRAGIC LOSS A LESSON FOR INDUSTRY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE death of Claude Vincent serves as a grim reminder of the
potential pitfalls of travelling in the emerging tourism markets of
former Indochina.

A dangerous cocktail of war, weaponry and poverty in Laos
contributed to this senseless act of violence that cost Mr Vincent
his life. This is a scenario that has played itself all to often in
Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar and at times even Thailand.

We are often reminded that this can easily happen in New York or in
Europe, and cases of Asian visitors slain on trips to North America
are not unknown.

But that knowledge does little to soften the loss.

Few foreigners, in Laos, or in other countries in the region have
done more for their adopted country than Mr Vincent.

He was fond of saying that Laos was his country, his people, and he
worked with a passion that showed his commitment to his adopted
land.

After moving to Laos, he was one of only five or six expatriates
who stayed on after the liberation of Vientiane in 1975.

Having started a tour company in the early 1970s, he continued to
operate tours for visiting dignitaries heading to Vietnam until a
Vietnamese Embassy opened in 1977.

From 1977 untill 1989 he worked in trading coffee and in the
transportation industry, which opened his eyes to the beauty of
southern Laos, where several of Sodetour's lodges are located.

After returning to tourism with the Lao National Tourism Company in
1989, Mr Vincent started Sodetour in 1992, and the network of
lodges soon followed.

He was active in forming the Tourism Development Coalition in 1993
and was well know in the foreign community as a liaison between
Laotians and westerners.

This sad event should make the industry as a whole pause for
thought as operators rush into expanding markets. Concerns over
people's safety and security should never exceed the need to buy
and sell travel.

His passing also serves as a reminder of the dangers of tourism
expanding faster than the infrastructure and national development
in countries around the region.

LAO AVIATION STRUGGLES

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

VIENTIANE - Lao Aviation's new management team from joint-venture
partner China Yunnan Airlines is struggling to improve service and
bring the national carrier into the black one year after taking
over the reins.

Low load factors and local agents' expressed reluctance to sell the
airline leave several unanswered questions.

The Vientiane-Chiang Mai route is only running in the 30 per cent
range.

Nevertheless, Lao Aviation will still lease a second B737-200
(delivered on November 1) from the US and apply to fly to Hong
Kong, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Flights from Vietiane to
Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh and Phnom Penh will be added.

FEE BATTLE LOOMING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong

HONG KONG - Travel agents are hoping airlines will not resort to
raising air fares too high to buffer major increases in charges at
Chek Lap Kok airport.

Airlines and travel agents are waiting on the airport authority to
announce the cost structure for landing and other fees at Chek Lap
Kok.

P & O manager, Ms Irene Law, said she understood there should be a
premium for using a new airport such as Chek Lap Kok.

Ms Law said: "Although we have heard about the expected increased
rates for the new airport, it is still too early to say how much
airfares would be hiked. The question we ask is, to what extent?"

Mr Terence Wong, manager of Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services,
said travel agents would not worry about hiked rates.

He said air fares would not be able to climb too high as there
would be heightened competition as more airlines used the new
airport.

Another industry source believed that airlines had inherent
structures to provide leeway for such increases.

"Airlines will have to do cost-altering in other aspects of their
operations to balance off the increase so that it will not cause
air fare hikes which are too high," he said.

He believed that Hong Kong's airport would continue to be strategic
for airlines compared to neighbouring airports in China and Macau.

Various Asian airlines want to see at least some of the airport
authority's books before agreeing to pay higher charges for Chek
Lap Kok.

Orient Airlines Association, the major regional representative
airline body, warned of the detrimental effects the hiked rates
would have on airlines and travellers.

Mr Richard Stirland, director-general of the association, said the
news was "extremely disturbing for airlines and bad news for
travellers".

Mr Stirland expected a negative impact on tourism and trade to be
the result.

He said it was idle to assume airlines could simply absorb such an
increase without either passing it on to passengers through higher
fares or re-examining the economics of all services to Hong Kong.

AGENTS CAN WIN GAMES EXCLUSIVE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Laura Lee

KUALA LUMPUR - Travel agents are being promised a share of the
action by the company which has been appointed to handle hotel
reservations for the Commonwealth Games in 1998.

Sukom Accommodation Bureau (SAB) '98, a specialised department set
up between organisers Sukom Ninety Eight and the UK-based Byrom
Consultants to organise lodging for visitors to the games, is not
designed to take away business from travel agencies.

Sukom Ninety Eight executive chairman, Gen (R) Tan Sri Hashim Mohd
Ali, told TTG Asia that SAB '98's role was a complementary one.

It would not have a monopoly over room bookings for the
Commonwealth Games as organisers want to avoid sky-high prices.

An estimated 6,000 rooms, ranging from dormitory-style to five-star
suites, have been selected from 44 hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor
and Langkawi. Properties include: Hotel Istana; The Legend Hotel &
Apartments; Hotel Nikko; New World Hotel; Swiss Garden Hotel;
Renaissance Palm Garden; Sheraton Subang Hotel; Sunway Lagoon
Resort Hotel; Burau Bay Resort; and Radisson Tanjung Rhu.

Byrom Consultants event manager, Mr Jaime Byrom, praised Sukom
Ninety Eight for its early preparations.

He said: "We find Sukom Ninety Eight the most dynamic organising
committee that we have come across so far.

"We never had a brochure done two years before the event."

OPERATORS HAIL BEIJING'S DRIVE TO RAISE STANDARDS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HONG KONG - A nation-wide drive to monitor and remedy tourism
problems has got the thumbs up from China inbound travel agents
raring to see better business in the mainland.

Travel agents are lauding the National Tourism Administration's
service quality supervision system to promote standard service
within the country's tourism sector, which they say is gaining good
ground since its implementation this June.

"Efforts like these are going to bring in good business for us in
the long run," said Ms Eva Lai of Swire Travel.

Apart from getting less complaints from clients, she has noticed
that travellers are feeling more confident about going on a holiday
to the mainland.

But she said Chinese authorities should pay attention to details
when implementing measures.

Patterson Travel Service director, Mr Ling Kam Man, said that in
the past two years, service from travel agents and hotels has been
a lot better than before, especially with new five-star hotels
opening.

HAWAII EYES VISA WAIVER

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

SEOUL - The state of Hawaii is pushing hard for a visa waiver for
Korean tourists visiting the US.

"Hawaii is now working very hard on the issue of waiving visas for
Koreans," said Mr Kazumasa Tamura, vice-president of the Asia &
Pacific division of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau.
"There is strong official support in Hawaii among the governor and
senators."

Mr Tamura, who was in town for the Korean World Travel Fair
recently, said he expected the number of Koreans visiting Hawaii to
triple if visas were waived.

In 1995, 100,000 Koreans visited Hawaii.

However, Mr Paul Linneman, information officer at the US Embassy in
Seoul, said the law states clearly that a waiver can only be
considered if the rate of visa refusals for a country is less than
two per cent.

"Currently, between five and seven per cent of Korean applicants
are refused visas and this clearly falls outside the current
guidelines."

The US began the visa-waiver system in 1989 and among the first
beneficiaries were the UK and Japan.

HONG KONG: TRADE DOES NOT FEAR NET

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong and Susie Zanardi

HONG KONG - Travel agents here are confident that direct airline
booking via the Internet will not threaten their livelihood.

"Although customers may book their tickets for simple travel plans
through the Internet, travel agents need not view this development
through wary eyes," said Mr Wyn Li, KLM sales and marketing manager
for China, Hong Kong and Macau.

"There will always be an important role for travel agents in the
scheme of things. The more complicated holiday plans will entail
different itineraries and flight schedules from various airports,
which customers don't have the patience for, even if the
information may be available to them," he said.

For such service, the customer will still turn to the travel agent.

Mr Li was commenting on a recent announcement by Dutch airline KLM
that limited ticket booking service for its flights would be
available via the Internet. Cathay Pacific Airways also said it was
keen to sell tickets on the Net within the next two years.

Mr Richard Willis, regional director and general manager of P&O
Travel, encouraged travel agents to embrace these technological
advancements as they would come fast and slick. "Most travellers
cannot handle the complex fare structures and won't really have
access to all the comparative airline fares and schedules," he
said.

Going on the Net, he said, would only serve to highlight the travel
agent's role as consultant and "custodian of the client".

"It would only be a threat if travel agents become complacent and
fail to face up to technology," said Mr Willis.

Ms Ridy Suen, leisure travel manager for Thomas Cook, said that the
Internet could be turned into an advantage for the agent. "On our
part, we have begun packaging holiday destinations - which include
air fare, accommodations and other services - and made them
available on our Web site and the response has been very good."

But Mr David Ho, managing director of Sime Travel in Singapore,
said: "Whether it is KLM or any other airline, the moment it
infiltrates into customer fares, it will affect agents. But those
who need other services will still go to agents."

Mr James Reinnoldt, Northwest regional managing director for South-
east Asia and Greater China, said: "In Internet sales, airlines
find the customers. The agent only issues the tickets. But for the
full range of service provided by agents, we will still pay the
full nine per cent."

JAKARTA RATES STILL FALLING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

JAKARTA - Five-star Gran Melia's opening salvo of US$145 per night
could change the way the market looks at Jakarta hotels.

Now suffering from a high inventory of hotel rooms, with more to
open in 1997, Jakarta's hotel rates have been on a downward spin
for a few months, though some continue to maintain US$200 a night.

Hoteliers have been closely monitoring Gran Melia, which soft-
opened in July. Its opening rates have had an impact on hotels
within the "golden triangle" - the confluence of three major
avenues in Jakarta.

Some four-star hotels feared it could be disastrous for them if
Gran Melia opened with US$139 a night, while some five-star
properties said they would hurt if the opening rate was less than
US$169.

Gran Melia general manager, Mr Eberhard Linke, told TTG Asia: "We
must be realistic. We do not live in Utopia. We know the market and
what it can do".

Mr. Patrick Fiat, general manager of Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, said
he is monitoring Gran Melia's pricing strategy.

"If they go down that will pull down everybody - Holiday Inn,
Mandarin, Hilton, and Regent," he said.

SINGAPORE: ATTRACTIONS DISTRACTIONS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Margie T Logarta

SINGAPORE - Dwindling visitor numbers have prompted the Association
of Singapore Attractions (ASA) to organise a series of workshops to
educate members about the needs of inbound markets.

A survey by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB), showed an
11.2 per cent decrease in entries to tourism attractions in 1994,
attributed to keen regional competition and shorter stays. In 1995,
the figure improved to only a 1.5 per cent drop due to rock-bottom
prices.

ASA chairman, Mr Francis Phun, said the seminars will prepare the
organisation for aggressive promotions.

He said: "We had some sales missions in the past but the results
were not fantastic. We are now in the process of taking stock of
ourselves so we will know how to reposition ourselves better."

Speakers will include chief executives of some of ASA's member
organisations and travel specialists who will share insights on
individual markets such as the Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese.

Mr Phun said tourism entrepreneurs cannot depend on the STPB for
survival.

"We have to stop being passive and bring in the business ourselves.
If we can bring the cake back to Singapore, then that is the time
we can share it."

The island's humid environment, he added, had also been identified
as a factor linked to the decrease in visitor patronage.

LUFTHANSA QUITTING NEPAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Neelam Mathews

KATHMANDU - Nepalese tour operators are blaming the government for
a slowdown in tourism growth following Lufthansa German Airlines'
decision to give notice to quit the kingdom.

Operators said despite Nepal proclaiming its Visit Nepal Year,
landing and parking charges in the first six months have been
increased by 50 per cent and fuel charges by 30 per cent.

With calls being made for a new airport, sources contend there is
nothing on the horizon. They do not expect swift action as the
present airport was built with 70-80 per cent foreign aid.

The travel trade says pollution and lack of planning is leading to
the decline of Nepal's tourism.

Lufthansa, the only European carrier flying directly to Kathmandu,
has explained why it is almost certain to withdraw from Nepal.

Low yields, the end of double digit tourism growth and difficulties
with the location of its international airport, are being cited as
main reasons.

Lufthansa flew more than 25,000 passengers last year into Nepal but
the airline's board is expected to decide for a stop in operations.

Following Lufthansa's directive to German tour operators that the
carrier will not accept bookings to Nepal after April next year, Mr
Kavin Sethi, corporate communications director Asia/Pacific, flew
to the country to inform the trade.

Mr Sethi said: "The board is reviewing the viability of the route
as part of an overall exercise to ensure permanent competitiveness
for the Lufthansa product."

The unique location of Kathmandu airport in a valley, with a 3,000m
runway instead of the conventional 4,000m, is being cited by
Lufthansa as a reason for a cut in profits.

Most aircraft flying into Kathmandu are twin-engined. To ensure
safety in case of engine failure during take-off, either passenger
or fuel load has to be reduced. Except for nearby-based Thai
Airways International, all carriers stop en-route to refuel.

Mr Sethi said: "This has led to additional costs as we require
three sets of crew as against two on a direct haul for the same
distance.

Lufthansa started operations in Nepal nine years ago. Since then,
its presence in the Himalayan kingdom has grown continuously.

To meet the growing travel and export demand in the Nepalese
market, Lufthansa has three weekly flights via Karachi to
Frankfurt.

"We have been the only western carrier to offer direct services to
Kathmandu.

"The others are all east-bound carriers."

NO MORE FLIGHTS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

KATHMANDU - The Royal Nepal Airlines has cancelled its India and
Paris flights for an indefinite period because of a shortage of
aircraft.

For several days, the airline has run press advertisements telling
clients to contact travel agents without spelling out its impending
intentions.

The India sector is the most lucrative route for the carrier. RNA
flies twice daily to New Delhi and once weekly to Mumbai and
Calcutta.

The cancellation follows the expiration of a leased B-727 from
Aviogenex of Serbia. The contract had expired four months ago.

REBELS HURTING IRIAN TREKKING TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Virginia Saunders

JAKARTA - Tour operators offering mountain climbing packages in
Irian Jaya have seen business fall by at least 40 per cent this
year because of military operations against Irian Jaya rebels.

"We are all hurting," said Mr Chaksana Said, marketing manager of
Trekmate Outdoor Adventures.

"The hostage situation in Irian has been going on since January,
and a second abduction came in August right after the first one was
resolved. We have had to cancel all our tour packages and readjust
our plans for the whole year."

Members of the Free Papua Movement in January kidnapped 26 people,
including seven foreigners. In May, a military rescue operation saw
two Indonesian hostages killed before the others were rescued.

On August 14, an armed group seized 16 logging workers near the
south-eastern base of Cartensz peak.

Authorities have closed the glacier-covered Cartensz Pyramid, the
fifth highest peak in the world at 4,884m.

Trekmate, which was selling Irian Jaya to an international
adventure market, was enjoying brisk business before the crisis.

Mr Eka Agus Rachman, managing director, said: "The Cartensz Pyramid
is the main objective of these seasoned professional climbers. We
have tried offering other alternatives, but they won't climb any
other mountain in Indonesia. It is either Cartensz or nothing".

Expeditions to Cartensz start from US$1,900 per person. Trekmate is
looking at running more outward bound programmes and shifting to
soft adventure tours in Baliem Valley at the base of the peak.

Mr Said added that hard adventure programmes in Indonesia had
difficulties with travel insurance.

Trekmate does not know when Cartensz will reopen for trekking tours
and expeditions. Mr Said said it was up to the government.

INDIA: AGENTS SLAM IA FARE HIKE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Neelam Mathews

NEW DELHI - Tour operators have condemned a 16.3 per cent fare rise
on domestic carrier Indian Airlines (IA) from September 22.

The rise will be in effect on all routes except in the north-
eastern sector, where the hike will be 10 per cent. According to
Indian Airlines, the US dollar fare will be revised with effect
from March 1.

Indian domestic traffic, of which 70 per cent is corporate, is not
likely to decline significantly but tour operators fear the leisure
market  will suffer a 15 per cent fall.

A Delhi-Mumbai one-way business class ticket will now cost US$176
instead of the previous US$151.  Economy goes up to US$118 against
US$101. Delhi to Madras by economy will be US$179 (formerly
US$154), and business class US$267 (US$230). Some fares can go up
by 15 to 30 per cent, depending on the sector.

"Indian tourism seems to be bent on stomping on its own feet," said
Ms Mili Sham, tour manager for Travel Inn.

"We're sending a crystal clear message to the world that we are
unreliable. What happens to my tours that have already been paid
and booked for the months between April to June 1997 based on IA's
present tariff?"

She said that her company now either faced law suits or absorbed
the cost which she claimed.

Mr Rajiv Wahie, Vacations Travels and Tours sales director, said
India was pricing itself out of the market. "IA had a 15 per cent
price hike in January this year...now comes another bombshell."

TOUR AGENTS KILLED IN LAOS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Tom Racette

BANGKOK - Mr Claude Vincent, director of Vientiane-based Sodetour,
and three staff have been killed in an ambush on a newly-built
portion of highway 13 to Luang Prabang.

Sources in Vientiane said Mr Vincent was transporting a recently-
purchased minivan with six other staff members on September 12 to
the company's new provincial office in the northern city of Luang
Prabang.

In an apparent robbery, unknown assailants riddled the van with
bullets and made off with currency and valuables worth more than
US$9,000, said marketing manager of That Luang Tour, Mr Surith
Sengsavang.

A French resident of Laos for more than 30 years, Mr Vincent was a
tireless promoter of Lao tourism and had travelled extensively
around the country without incident.

Travelling by road from Vientiane to Luang Prabang is not
considered safe. Another assault outside the town of Kasi took
place eight months ago in the same spot where Mr Vincent was
killed, said Novotel Vientiane general manager, Mr Arnauld Kindt.

He expressed surprise that Mr Vincent had taken highway 13 to Luang
Prabang.

He said: "He always told me it's safe to travel anywhere in Laos,
but not there. Not by road."

Mr Kindt was among a number of South-east Asian trade professionals
ready to pay tribute to Mr Vincent, saying he was the first to
promote the country in foreign markets.

He continued: "He was the one to explain and promote the country to
European travel agents after Laos opened to tourism. His door was
always open to people who wanted advice on where to go and what to
see."

Tour operators told TTG Asia that only foreign backpackers on local
transport make the journey.

"Our company never sells programmes with land transfers to the
north. We receive requests from abroad but we always refuse.
Officially, it isn't allowed," said Diethelm Travel Laos managing
director, Ms Vayakone Bodhisane.

According to Mr Surith, the incident highlighted the risk of
overland transfers in a country which is just opening up to
tourism.

"The new road to Luang Prabang is still very dangerous. We can't
guarantee our clients' safety and something like this can still
happen anytime."

Mr Bounty Sayarath, product manager for Sodetour, said operations
would "continue as usual" for the immediate future.

Mr Vincent, 56, is survived by his wife and four children.

The other staff killed in the attack were Lao nationals: Mr Sythong
Bounsavath, guide; Mr Phomma Lamlong, administrator; and Mr
Thongphanh Thippakdee, driver.

Three other staff were understood to have been in the bus at the
time of the attack. One is reported to be seriously wounded while
the other two escaped injury.

Finding quality information covering the events that shape the culture in third world countries can be a difficult task, especially if you rely solely on the American news media.  Dr.  William Close discovered the value, timeliness and breadth of NewsNet's international newswires in finding exactly this type of information.  For many years, Dr.  Close has relied on NewsNet to help keep him informed on the current happenings in Zaire, where he lived and worked for 16 years, as well as several other Central African Countries.<P>

Dr.  Close, who first went to live in Zaire in 1960, has extensive experience with third world countries.  He served as the personal physician to the President of Zaire, the chief doctor for the Congolese army, and as manager of a 2,000-bed hospital.  When the first Ebola epidemic struck in Zaire in 1976, he ran logistics for the team of international scientists who dealt with the epidemic.<P>

Since his return to the U.S.  in 1976, Dr.  Close has maintained regular contact with his associates in Zaire and helps to facilitate medical relief by acting as an unofficial liaison between the Center for Disease Control and the Zairian government.  Dr.  Close, has become a regular NewsNet user in order to stay current with news and events taking place in Zaire and other countries, and finds that the international newswire services provide the best coverage for his needs.<P>

One topic he monitors regularly on NewsNet is the Ebola virus.  Drawing on his experiences living in Africa, Dr.  Close wrote a documentary novel this year titled "Ebola," published by Ballantine/Ivy.  The book deals with events in the tropical rain forests before the arrival of the scientists.  It is the story of people involved in a terrifying intrusion seen through the eyes of a Flemish nun.<P>

Dr.  Close is an avid NewsFlash user, he finds it to be particularly useful while he's traveling.  "With NewsFlash," he said, "I can keep up to date with what's going on all over the world."  Too many people today are misinformed about third world countries, according to Dr.  Close, and keeping up to date with the help of NewsNet and NewsFlash is one way individuals can combat this problem for themselves.  "If you have NewsNet," he related, "you can download tailored information in order to be well informed in the areas relating to your particular interests."<P>

Riley must wear the metal bar (called a K.E. apparatus, which is held in place by two bolts running through his bone) for another two weeks. The bar is wrapped in red protective gauze to avoid further injury.</FONT></P><H1>Cashing in on an expensive life</H1><P><STRONG>Riley trades in first of nine lives for a pricey trip to the veterinarian</STRONG></P><P><B>by Ric Hallock</B><I>of the Tribune staff</I></P><P>Everson resident Karen Harris is getting a big lesson in economics from her cat, Riley.</P><P>Three weeks ago, Karen's brother, Brian, found Riley injured, lying  in a flower bed. What was first thought to be a broken right rear leg, turned into a severely broken leg -- the tibia was in nearly 30 pieces -- and a hip dislocation of the left rear leg.</P><P>Prognosis: costly. Riley's current tab is around $700, but is expected to go up more due to return check-ups on the legs, medications, etc. </P><P>"He had a really horrid wound," said Dr. John Berry, who performed the surgery on Riley. "He's kind of a miracle cat, he's recovering so well." Berry said many people would choose to put the animal to sleep with these types of wounds.</P><P>Was there any doubt about paying Riley's hospital expenses vs. euthanasia?</P><P>"We didn't dwell on it long," said Marca Harris, Karen's mother. "I had just gone through putting my older cat to sleep last year and I wasn't going to go through that again." She noted that outside of his wounds, Riley still had a good chance of survival.</P><P>When asked what they could do about the cost, Karen started immediately thinking of ways to raise money to offset her cat's vet expenses.</P><P>She has baked and sold cookies, sewn some dolls with her grandmother, stayed after school to help clean classrooms, done housework and this Saturday at the Union 76 station on the corner of Hannegan and Pole roads, she will be having a car wash from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</P><P>At last count she had raised, "$136 and 25 cents," Karen said. "He's my cat and I love him."</P><P>Having to spend time apart while Riley convalecsed was difficult for Karen. But  Berry and the staff at Lynden Veterinary Hospital allowed her to visit Riley nearly every day.</P><P>"Wednesday she has piano lessons so we couldn't go," Harris said.</P><P>On her visits, Karen would sit with Riley for 20-30 minutes petting, kissing and rubbing him.</P><P>"He understands what happened and knows I love him," Karen said.</P><P>After his release Monday, Karen said he's walking on the leg and seems "really happy to be home again."  The main concern now is to turn him into a house cat. But Riley may give in on that one.</P><P>"His personality has changed. He's more ... mellow. Before he was much more energetic," said Harris. "And now he purrs a lot. He didn't used to very much at all."</P><P>Once the family got Riley home Karen began "doting him like a nurse," Harris said. "She carried him to the litterbox and she won't let anyone touch the leg," including her younger sister, Susan.</P><P>At Karen's school, Evergreen Christian in Bellingham, many of the students have been following the progress of Riley ever since Karen brought his X-rays to show and tell.</P><P>From the experience Karen said she had learned, "It's always good to take care of your cat for they might do something nice for you."</P><P> "For more news and complete community information, <A HREF="subscribe.html">subscribe </A>to the Lynden Tribune today."</P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif" ALT="[--------------------------------------------------------------------------]" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=1></P><A HREF="top.html"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A><P><HR>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  TOP STORY | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |<HR>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA<BR></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

The specific school would depend on where students live and the revised attendance-area boundaries.</P><P>"This meeting is for sharing of information and for discussion. The board will not make any decision about Deming's future status," Hunter said.</P><P>Enrollment in kindergarten through sixth grade has increased 45 percent in the past nine years in the Mount Baker School District.</P><P>Yet the district has had problems getting voter approval on recent bond issues to build a new elementary school.</P><P>A $7 million bond issue was soundly defeated in 1987.  Voters also defeated a $14 million bond issue in 1994. A new elementary school was the key issue in both.</P><P>In 1989 voters did pass overwhelmingly an $8.2 million bond issue for construction of a new junior-senior high school.  However, this bond issue also was intended to provide money for additions at Harmony and Acme elementary schools, but those didn't occur.</P><P>"It fell way short of what had been envisioned," Hunter said.</P><P>School district officials have been working to rebuild their credibility.</P><P>When the 1994 bond issue failed, a separate committee formed  to find reasons. Money topped the list. Credibility issues were also a factor. Sixteen percent said in a survey they voted against the bond issue because they believed the 1989 bond didn't cover as much as was proposed. </P><P>In July, a facilities committee for the Mount Baker School District presented the school board two options for how to handle growth and overcrowding.</P><P>The first option, estimated at $9.94 million, includes construction of a new elementary school in Kendall for 525 students and construction of four permanent classrooms each at Acme and Harmony elementary schools. Also, the mechanical and electrical systems at Deming Elementary would be upgraded.</P><P>The second option, estimated at $10.34 million, is identical to the first but also includes buying land for future schools or athletic fields and making improvements to the high school fieldhouse and to the districtwide telecommunications system.</P><P>"We've scaled back," Hunter said, comparing these options to the 1994 bond issue.</P><P>If Mount Baker voters have a bond issue before them in May, Hunter estimated the cost will probably be at the rate of 50 cents per $1,000 of assessed valuation. This would cost $50 per year for the owner of a $100,000 home.</P><P>The rate is much less than the rate of $1.67 per $1,000 property owners would have had to have paid if the 1994 bond issue had passed.</P><P>Besides the lower bond amount, Hunter stated two other reasons for the lower rate. Assessed valuation of property in the district has increased. Also, "This district gets a substantial amount of state forest money."</P><P>State forest money has been coming into the district coffers at a record rate. Hunter said the money has been built up and will be pledged to buy back the bond.</P><P>"If there's a silver lining in having to take this long it's that we do have all the details."</P><P>Hunter added the school board will probably vote in six weeks on whether to close Maple Falls Elementary or keep it open as a smaller satellite school to Kendall.  </P><P> "For more news and complete community information, <A HREF="subscribe.html">subscribe </A>to the Lynden Tribune today."</P><BR><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif" ALT="[--------------------------------------------------------------------------]" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=1></P><!--SECONDARY STORY--><H2>Lummis' gamble new casino site fares better</H2><P><STRONG>New location four miles closer to I-5</STRONG></P><P><B>by Josh Barnhill</B><I>For the Tribune</I></P><P>A new casino that Lummi Nation plans to open early next year at Haxton Way and Slater Road will help the tribe in its quest for economic independence, tribal officials said Monday.</P><P>The tribe announced a deal in which Showboat, Inc. of Atlantic City, N.J. will finance and operate a tribal-owned 65,000-square-foot casino. It will feature table games, live entertainment, keno games and several restaurants.</P><P>The tribe's best guess is that the facility will cost $15 million, said Clayton Finkbonner, Lummi Nation's economic development director. The agreement with Showboat says the total cost can't exceed $5 million.</P><P>The partners will pursue design work, but will wait for approval from federal and state gambling commissions before they break ground.</P><P>The new site is two miles south of Ferndale and two miles west of Interstate 5. The tribe's current casino at Gooseberry Point, six miles farther from I-5, will be closed when the new one opens, Finkbonner said.</P><P>"A development plan for Gooseberry Point -- the tribe owns 12 acres there -- that'll be the next project," Finkbonner said. "We want to hit the ground running on that."</P><P>The Lummi Indian Business Council chose the site on tribal land at the intersection of Slater and Haxton roads because it features convenient access to Interstate 5.</P><P>"Thebest (site) would have been right on I-5, but that's not really possible," Finkbonner said. He noted that state regulators only allow casinos on reservation land or on land a tribe has owned since 1988.</P><P>The casino will be the most accessible large casino for gamblers from the Vancouver, B.C. metropolitan area. Buses regularly bring gamblers from there to casinos in Deming and on Bow Hill. It will be the region's only 24-hour casino, Tribal Chairman Henry Cagey said in a statement.</P><P>The tribe always intended the current casino, which was the county's first when it opened in 1991, to be a temporary site, Finkbonner said.</P><P>The Lummi Casino employs 250 workers now, down from a high of 450. It has faced increasing competition from other tribal casinos in northwest Washington.</P><P>The Nooksack Tribe opened the Nooksack River Casino in Deming on April 16, 1993. Since then, the Upper Skagit tribe has collaborated with casino giant Harrah's on a casino along I-5 at Bow Hill, 16 miles south of Bellingham. Other tribal casinos operate in Marysville and several miles east of Anacortes.</P><P> "For more news and complete community information, <A HREF="subscribe.html">subscribe </A>to the Lynden Tribune today."</P><BR><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif" ALT="[--------------------------------------------------------------------------]" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=1></P><!--SECONDARY STORY STAND-ALONE PIC OF PEOPLE BEING FILMED, CUTLINE--><IMG SRC="newsimg/2-5KIRO.jpg" ALT=" " ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="116" BORDER="1" HSPACE="5"><P>The Lynden Tribune/MARY BETH NEAL</P><H2>Smile, you're on KIRO camera</H2><P><FONT SIZE="4">A KIRO-TV news team was in Lynden Jan. 29 working on a feature story for its morning show "7 Live."

Before the town wasincorporated in 1891, the town had a newspaper called TheLynden Pioneer Press. The masthead of the first issue carried the legend: "Vol. I Lynden, Washington Territory, Tuesday October, 16, 1888."</P><P>W.H. Dobbs owned the paper and L.D. Pangborn was the editor. Early pictures of the town show a small frame building on the south side of Front Street. In later years, this building would become the town hall and, in 1928, a new city hall would be built on the same location. </P><P>The Pioneer Press was published from 1888 to 1900, followed by what appeared to be a two-year interlude when the town had no established newspaper. The small frame building that had housed The Pioneer Press was taken in bankruptcy and Lynden later acquired it for a city hall.        </P><P>In 1902, W.H. Towner came to Lynden and started The Pacific-Pilot, a sprightly weekly that had one of the finest set ups for paper of its type anywhere in the country; especially for a town like Lynden, which had been carved out of the wilderness for only a few decades.</P><P>The population of Lynden varied from a few hundred to a thousand or more. Economic conditions caused the population to fluctuate. Much history of the town can be gleaned from perusing editions of The Pacific-Pilot. The newspaper did an excellent job of reporting the rift in the town when there were two mayors and two city councils vying for the job of administering the town's affairs. The early editors and publishers generally wrote the news as they saw it, making interesting reading for those wanting to pursue the historical information about the town that can only be found in these early newspaper accounts.</P><P>The Pacific-Pilot eventually ceased publication and was succeeded by The Lynden Sun-Pilot. That name was subsequently changed to <I>The Lynden Tribune</I>, and in 1914 Sol Lewis came to Lynden and purchased the newspaper.  The Tribune has been operated by the Lewis family since that time. Sol was the guiding hand in the early days. He gave it a stability that many small town papers did not have. He must have been a good financial manager as well as an editor and publisher. Sol ran the paper from 1914 until his death on June 12, 1953.       </P><P>His two sons had been a part of the paper during Sol's later years. William R. Lewis was the oldest and came to the paper in 1945. He retired in 1984. Bill's younger brother, Julian, joined the paper in 1948 and retired in 1992 when the third generation took over. Mike Lewis, son of Julian Lewis, came into control of the family enterprises in 1992 and became publisher when his father retired.       </P><P>The paper has grown. <I>The Lynden Tribune</I> is currently published every Wednesday but the business is not limited only to the paper. The printing and publishing end of the business has expanded to include many other publications, brochures and books as well.       </P><P>The Tribune currently employs 35 full time people and 11 part time employees.</P><P>Major accomplishments in the past several years include an upgrade to our Goss Community Web newspaper press. The company added a sixth press unit and a new folder in early 1994. This allowed the Tribune to increase its color capacity and press speed to meet its growing customer base which reaches into Skagit County and north into British Columbia.</P><P>In the spring of 1995 we completed a major computer upgrade in the graphics department, production department and the newsroom. This has allowed for enhanced graphics in the newspaper, more four-color photos as we now do all scanning and the separations in-house, and computer pagination of the newspaper. In April of 1996 we added an imagesetter in the production department.</P><P>The story of <I>The Lynden Tribune</I> has been chronicled in detail in the publication Sage of the Crossroads-Sol Lewis, by William Lewis.       </P><P>It is not often that a family is able to pass down a business from generation to generation. Quite often, a person of great energy will start a business and then turn it over to a son, who for some reason or another may be unable to keep the business going or adapt to changing circumstances. Often, by the time it gets to the third generation, the business has vanished from the scene.        </P><P>Each succeeding generation at the Tribune, however has managed to build on what the previous generations had accomplished.        </P><P>There is no reason not to expect that by the year of 2014, the Lewis family will still be in charge of the Tribune and its varied enterprises. The fourth generation is on hand and it may be likely that by the time of the 100th anniversary of the Lewis family at the Tribune, we may see them working at the paper that their great grandfather started long ago. </P><P><P><A NAME="Fast"><IMG SRC="image/line.gif" ALT="[--------------------------------------------------------------------------]" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=1></A></P><P><A HREF="about.html"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif" ALT="[--------------------------------------------------------------------------]" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=1></P><H2>Lynden Tribune Fast Facts</H2><P><B>Circulation:</B> 6,200; with Whatcom County Shopping Exchange, 14,000</P><P><B>Number of employees:</B> 45 -- 35 part-time and 20 full-time (not including paper carriers).</P><P><B>Weight of paper rolls used to print Tribune:</B> 900 pounds</P><P><B>Amount of paper used to print one edition of Tribune:</B> Approximately two tons</P><P><B>Amount of newsprint used by Lewis Publishing in one year:</B> 936 metric tons, or 2,059,200 Ibs.</P><P><B>Cost of full-page, one-color ad in Tribune:</B> $1,612.50</P><B><B>Cost of full-page, one-color ad in USA Today:</B> $78,000.00</B><P><B>Number of rolls of film developed by Tribune in one year:</B> Just a shot in the dark but we guess 850.</P><P><B>Other publications printed at the Tribune:</B> Record-Journal (Ferndale), Sudden Valley News, Western Front, AS Review (Western Washington University), Northwest Holstein, Western Jersey News, Blaine, Ferndale Lynden and Mount Baker high school newspapers, Our Town, Northwest Events, Business Journal, Whatcom Business Pulse, Skagit Business Pulse, Whatcom Watch, Skagit Farmer and more!</P><P><B>Types of presses in Tribune's commercial printing operation:</B> one Heidelberg SORMZ 20X29 and one Heidelberg Kord for color work; Chief, for envelopes and business cards; 6-unit Goss Community offset press for newspaper for newspaper printing.</P><P><B>All in the family:</B> Sol Lewis bought the Tribune in 1914 and was its publisher until 1953.

Judson and daughter Annie. They followed the same trail as her parents who traveled west to the Oregon Territory three years earlier. </P><P>    A son, Charles La Bonta Judson, was born on the trip. In her memoirs, based on her diaries while crossing the plains, she records the birth of her son in this way:     </P><P>'We reached La Bonta Creek on Saturday where we found god water, grass and wood. The Sabbath dawned most serenely upon us, a bright and lovely morning, the 26th of June. I am certain of the date for the day was made memorable to me by the birth of a son."</P><P>The Judsons first traveled to the Oregon Territory and visited the home of Phoebe's twin sister, Mary Meloy near Portland.</P><P>"I could not endure the thought of settling down with out first visiting this dear sister whom I loved as my own soul, and for whom I had often cried myself to sleep, when she had, three years before, with my father's family, emigrated to Oregon," she wrote. </P><P>After a brief visit, the Judsons traveled north of Grand Mound (now in Thurston County) to live near her parents. </P><P>It was not until 1871 that the Judsons left Grand Mound permanently in "search of an ideal home."</P><P>Judson was the first white woman north of the Nooksack River, her first trip made up stream in a canoe.</P><P>"The scenery was wild and picturesque. Bowers of willow, maple, cottonwood, alder and crabapple beautifully fringed the edge of this winding river," Judson wrote. </P><P>On a 160-acre parcel in what is now downtown Lynden that the Judsons settled. They paid $200 for the claim and began their lives as Lynden's first family. </P><P>Many older Lynden residents recall Judson sitting on the front porch of her home, which was located at the present site of the Lynden Bicycle Shop and Fabric Cottage in the 500 block of Front Street.</P><P>The Heritage Tree, a tall black walnut planted by Judson in 1882, still stands at the corner of 6th and Front streets.</P><P>Judson filled many roles in her life as a pioneer, including a midwife. One delivery she assisted was for Mrs. J.J. Booman, a friend of hers, at the birth of Booman's daughter, Ellen in 1892. </P><P>Ellen Booman Nelson, formerly of Lynden, recalled in an earlier interview that Judson was to attend the birth of her brother Albert five years later, but Judson fell, broke her hip and was unable to attend. Nel son's older sister, Almeda Booman Foster, who recalled in an earlier interview that Judson was always so kind to the little girls, recently passed away. </P><P>Education was a priority to Judson, and the first school was held in the Judson home as early as 1876.    </P><P>Judson is also remembered for her staunch Republicanism. Many older residents remember Judson voting at City Hall, where she was always allowed to vote first, even to the last.</P><P>She is buried alongside her husband in the Lynden Cemetery. Her headstone is plain -- it reads Judson, Phoebe 1831-1925 -- yet that is how Judson described herself in the introduction of her book: "a plain woman ... who has roughed it ... on the extreme northwestern frontier." </P><P>Phoebe Judson wrote a book, "A Ploneer's Search for an Ideal Home," on how she and her husband Holden came to the site of Lynden in 1871.</P><P>The first house of Holden and Phoebe Judson was located at what Is now the 500 block of Front Street.</P><A HREF="hist3.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1891 - 1900 ]</A><P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

Click on the image above to view a <A HREF="image/school1.jpeg">larger photograph</A> in JPEG format.</P><BR CLEAR=ALL><P>Lynden experienced a burst of rapid growth around the time of incorporation in 1891. According to the Pioneer Press of March 20, 1890, the population of the town had nearly doubled in the preceding year to between 700 and 800. </P><P>The Press promoted the Lynden area in glowing terms. Most needed in the Lynden area, it asserted, was "a thrifty class of farmers."</P> <P>   During the 1890s, indeed, a steady stream of hardy families did come to Lynden. They continued to clear the land of timber, drain it by means of ditching and prepare it for its rich agricultural production. </P><P>   The newcomer to town would find "a sentiment pronounced, aggressive, crystallized and dominant in favor of social purity, of education and religion," wrote editor L. D. Pangborn. </P><P>The Northwest Normal School, a teacher's college begun in 1886 in Lynden by Professor J.R. Bradley, had 120 students enrolled for its summer term in 1891. However, some state legislators wanted to have the school in Bellingham and in 1892 the valiant Lynden venture in higher education came to an end. </P><P>In 1892 the Stickney Island Home, a boarding school for Indian children, was established below Lynden on what is now the Hampton Road. The school operated into the 1920s. </P><P>Busy lumber mills in the Lynden area provided employment for many men in the 1890s. </P><P>Small, flatbottomed steam boats plied the Nooksack River up to Lynden, providing the best form of transportation for large cargoes from Bellingham Bay. The steamboat Triumph was built at Lynden in 1888. </P><P>In 1894 the Guide Meridian Road was planked. People came with their tents and camped for three days at Wiser Lake to celebrate. </P><P>The Judsons built their new landmark home in the 500 block of Front Street, with the Judson's Store building at the 5th Street corner. Mrs. Judson also had a black walnut tree planted at 6th and Front streets; the Heritage Tree still stands and is marked with a plaque at its base. </P>            <P><A HREF="hist4.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1901 - 1910 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

Click on the image above to view a <A HREF="image/phone.jpeg">larger photograph</A> in JPEG format.</P><BR CLEAR=ALL><P>    The first decade of the new century saw both steady growth and a steady migration of Hollanders to the area, whose presence is still dominant today. Population in Lynden was 1,000 in 1900.</P><P>A new church -- New Reform Christian Church (First Christian Reformed Church) --  was erected in 1903 with Rev. Bos as the pastor. The Methodist Episcopal Church was built earlier and the Baptist Church was built in 1909. First Reformed Church was organized in 1910 with 33 members. </P><P>W.H. Towner, editor of The Pacific Pilot, one of the first newspapers in Lynden, described the area as "the gem city." Subscription for the paper was $1 per year, in advance.</P><P>Mining, logging, farming, fishing and retailing led the list of industries in the early part of the century. </P><P>In 1905, Whatcom County boasted 129 shingle and saw mills with over 3,000 men employed in the industry. The legendary Lynden Department Store was founded by the enterprising William H. Waples in 1900. Advertisements in early newspapers quote prices for lace as 1 cent per yard. "We lead...Others follow" was the store's motto. Waples also offered the first cars in Lynden in 1909, with the price of a new Studebaker Runabout at $850.  </P><P>The Bank of Lynden was established in 1902 as the city's first bank by Simon Kildall. The Citizens' Bank opened in 1905 by C.S. Aldrich. Later in the decade, the banks merged. </P><P>At the first annual meeting of the Lynden Farmers Cooperative in Jan., 1903 it was announced that 177,896 pounds of cream were received the previous year at an average price of .2666 cents paid per pound. Lynden also boasted a cheese factory, opened in 1905 by F.J. Clark. </P><P>   The Lynden Commercial Club was founded in 1903 with Simon Kildall, proprietor of the O.K Department Store (forerunner of Farmer's Mercantile), as president. Sixteen secret societies also met weekly in Lynden by the end of the decade. </P><P>A railway was constructed from Bellingham to Lynden in 1903. In the same year, mail routes were established, telephone lines were connected, electric lights were introduced and a fire district was formed.</P><P>On Jan. 1, 1904, Lynden welcomed its first passenger train into the city with great celebration. Until then, the nearest rail line was the Sumas-Whatcom link through Hampton and Clearbrook. </P><P>   A new post office was dedicated in December, 1904 with Robert O'Neil as postmaster. </P><P>The first saloon in Lynden's history opened in 1903 despite much opposition. Many social events were held at Kildall Opera House, including meetings, dances and forums. A county fair began in 1901. </P>                      <P><A HREF="hist5.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1911 - 1920 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

In 1912 a berry experimental station was formed just outside the city limits on the Double Ditch Road, with the intent of testing 125 varieties of strawberries. </P><P>The boosters proved to be right about berries and fruit in general. In 1919 the Lynden Cannery processed 1.2 million pounds of fruit. The total included 315 tons of cherries, 75 tons of raspberries, 50 tons apiece of blackberries and apples, 25 tons apiece of loganberries, pears and prunes, and 10 tons of plums. </P><P>The Northwest Washington Fair, which had just started in 1910, quickly became popular. It was held in October and drew 20,000 spectators by 1919. </P><P>Chautauqua, a cultural and educational troupe which performed for a week at a time in towns, first came to Lynden in 1916. The 1917 festival featured a famous baritone from the Chicago Grand Opera Co., plays, music and lectures. A season ticket for the 26 events cost $2.50. </P><P>But World War I dominated the thoughts of residents in the second half of the decade. </P><P>A platoon of 25 Lynden men -- led by Rev. Percy H. Davies, a lieutenant -- was formed in the Washington State Guard. </P><P>In 1918 Bernie Fale was severely wounded in France. Fale, who enlisted as a 16-year old just a year earlier, was the first Lynden boy to fall on a foreign battlefield in this war. </P><P>Residents were urged to buy government Liberty Bonds, which paid 4 percent interest. </P><P>Lynden women were "Hooverizing" -- making mock mince meat with apples and green tomatoes since meat was expensive. But economic measures here paled in comparison to struggles in Holland, as reported in letters to local residents. </P><P>In the 1920 Polk Directory of Whatcom County, it was reported that Lynden had a population of 1,800; Ferndale, 1,500; Sumas, 1,400; Everson, 680; Nooksack, 500; Custer 400. </P>           <P><A HREF="hist6.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1921 - 1930 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

In the middle of the decade, the dairy and poultry industry was estimated to bring in $125,000 a week.</P><P>Peoples State Bank opened on Jan. 8, 1921, with $40,000 in stock distributed among 60 residents. The Dyk building was built this year. </P><P>Lynden was selected for a poultry station for fattening and dressing in March 1921, and it opened in May that year at a cost of $8,000. It could process 1,000 birds a day. </P><P>A powdered milk plant was opened in 1921. Three million pounds of milk was processed by the Whatcom County Dairymen's Association in October, 1921. </P><P>One factor leading to in creased milk production was the automatic milker. Ads for the DeLaval milker showed up in 1921 Tribunes. </P><P>The Peace Arch was dedicated in September of that year. </P><P>The city voted in many improvements during the decade. Bonds to build the first water system was approved in 1924 by a 3-1 margin. The old Lynden Grade School building, now demolished, was built in 1926. Lynden's current city hall was built in 1928. </P><P>The automobile began to play a big part in life. Lynden merchants were reported to have sold a car a day in 1923. Prices for a car in that year were $750 for a Ford Tudor Sedan. </P><P>Building paved roads be came a big issue, especially the development of an east-west paved highway across the state. Automobile registration, traffic signs, drivers' licenses, headlight requirements were introduced and printed fulminations against speeding and drunken driving became common.    </P><P>Some of the drunk drivers came from British Columbia, which was "wet" compared to the "dry" United States. Customs agents continually had to be on the lookout for booze runners, who went even 80 far as to drop off their wares in black sacks that resembled charred stumps in a field. </P><P>Lynden High School also started to develop its reputation for winning basketball. Lynden went to the state basketball tournament in Seattle and placed second, losing only to Walla Walla in the championship game. </P><P>Lynden Christian School, meanwhile, continued to grow, adding a fifth classroom to the Grover Street school building. Enrollment topped the 200 mark in 1924 and a second story and a basement was added to the school, making eight classrooms. </P><P>That same year, the state's voters soundly rejected an effort to outlaw private and parochial schools; LCS supporters and the Tribune both campaigned against the measure.</P><P>Lynden firefighters held a pavement dance in 1921, but upon objection from certain segments of the community, vowed to hold no more. </P><P>Phoebe Judson, the "mother" of Lynden, died in 1925. </P>           <P><A HREF="hist7.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1931 - 1940 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

There were 2,475 persons living in Lynden Township, and county farms numbered 4,276.</P><P>Although the country as a whole was slipping into the Great Depression, Lynden in early 1930 seemed to be escaping the economic doldrums. Only 14 persons in the city and 19 in the Lynden Township reported being out of work. </P><P>The one-mile stretch of road between city limits and the Guide Meridian was given its first cement surface in 1930.</P><P>Chick hatching was be coming a big agricultural enterprise in the Lynden area. It was estimated that well over 1 million chicks were hatched annually in commercial and farm operations, and a record 178 people were employed at the Lynden station of the Washington Co-operative Egg and Poultry Association.</P><P>By a vote of 60-23 in June 1930, residents in the North Prairie school district rejected the idea of consolidating into the Lynden School District. By later in the decade, however, North Prairie, along with many other rural school systems, had merged into the Lynden district.</P><P>The Lynden plant of the Whatcom County Dairymen's Association was producing a ton of cheese, eight tons of powdered milk and five tons of butter daily, according to manager Oscar Mock. </P><P>Tribune editor Sol Lewis chastised the state Democratic and Republican parties (the latter holding its convention in Bellingham) for bowing to liquor interests and approving "wet" planks in their policy platforms. He predicted that voters statewide would uphold Prohibition in the 1930 fall election.</P><P>LeCocq-Nicholson Motors, 4th and Front streets, was selling new Ford Deluxe Sedans for $640, f.o.b. Detroit.</P><P>The Liberty Theatre in Lynden featured at least one of the era's "all-talking pictures" in shows each week. Admission in 1930 was 40 cents for adults, 15 cents for children.</P><P>In 1933 Lynden businesses cooperated with President Roosevelt in adopting the requirements of the National Recovery Act. That was expected to put more men to work locally and reduce the number of families needing relief.</P><P>Due to the Depression, the Lynden public school budget for 1933-34 was one-third less than two years earlier.</P><P>At the 1935 Armistice Day observance at the Lynden border crossing, Canadians and Americans also celebrated the completion of paving of the 16 miles of the Guide Meridian from Bellingham to the border.  Lynden businesses were closed for the holiday.</P><P>Construction of sidewalks on West Front Street from B.C. Avenue west to city limits was one Lynden WPA project. An allocation of $1,860 paid for the labor.  </P><P>A fire destroyed the downtown Crescent Mercantile Co. building on Nov. 17, 1937. The loss, including much Christmas merchandise, was estimated at $50,000. From the demise came The New Crescent store of to day.</P><P><A HREF="hist8.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1941 - 1950 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

An article in the Lynden Tribune on March 11, 1943 predicted that Lynden would experience a 25 percent increase in population in the post-war period. </P><P>On Dec. 8, 1941, publisher Sol Lewis wrote that "Lynden 'blacks out' as the grim reality of war is brought home to farm and shop."</P><P>Many Whatcom County boys enlisted in the war effort, and editorials and advertisements in the Lynden Tribune made reference to their service.</P><P>Information on civil defense and enforcement of 35 mph speed limits were published, as well as cartoons putting down Japanese and Germans.</P><P>Many local schoolchildren, women's organizations and service clubs joined in the war effort by buying war bonds and sending care packages to servicemen abroad through the Red Cross.</P><P>A new post office was dedicated in Lynden in November 1940 with Congressman-elect Henry M. Jackson in attendance. The mural depicting "Mother of Lynden" Phoebe Judson was unveiled in December 1942. A new highschool gym and many local churches and businesses also expanded during the decade. A $51,000 power sub-station was also built. </P><P>On Oct. 6, 1941, Lynden welcomed its first kindergarten class. In 1949, over 500 Lynden High School alumni attended the first all-school alumni reunion celebrating 40 years of public education in the area.    </P><P>Plans for a Lynden Memorial Hospital were introduced, although the idea was later scrapped.</P><P>The dairy industry released 1945 figures for output as 122 million pounds of milk and 5 million pounds of butterfat during the war years. Dairy products were shipped overseas and Lynden saw rationing of consumer goods akin to other parts of the country.</P><P>Figures in 1945 for the poultry industry showed 16 county hatcheries producing 1 million chicks per year.</P><P>A new "mile" bridge was constructed on the Guide Meridian over the Nooksack River in 1949, at a cost of $570,000. A comprehensive plan for developing Berthusen Park was introduced in 1945, complete with a swimming pool, museum, golf range and softball fields. </P><P>Two earthquakes rocked the area during the 1940s and the "worst northeaster on record" blasted the county in early 1950. </P><P><A HREF="hist9.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1951 - 1960 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

Just a month later, an unusual nine-day March snow storm kept some farmers from receiving mail for 10 days. Then a summer heat wave left Lynden without rain for 49 straight days.</P><P>The military draft took many young men for the Korean War. Elbert Isom, principal of Lynden High School, said in 1951 more teachers were needed and Dr. George Anderson, president of the new Whatcom County Agricultural Labor Committee, said the draft also was causing a shortage of workers for farm labor.</P><P>Pvt. Albert S. Andrews, a 19-year-old Lynden Christian High School graduate, was Lynden's first fatality in the war. He died April 4, 1951.     Charles Philo, who fought fires in Lynden for 44 years and was its fire chief for 27, was succeeded by Chauncey Weidkamp in 1951.</P><P>A new $1 million Guide Meridian bridge over the Nooksack River opened at the start of the Northwest Washington Fair in August 1951. The bridge helped the 40th annual fair in 1956 set an attendance record of 22,435. </P><P>Some businesses reached milestones. Oordt Brothers Hatchery, founded by Herman Oordt and then operated by son Arthur Oordt, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1951. It had 4,900 chickens at the start of the year. Knapp and Knapp, a furniture store, marked its 50th anniversary in 1958. </P><P>The National Bank of Commerce of Seattle bought the First National Bank of Lynden, which had been established as Citizens State Bank in 1905. On Jan. 1, 1955, National Bank of Commerce and Peoples State Bank doubled the rate of interest on savings accounts -- from 1 per cent to 2 percent. The 1 percent interest rate had stood for nearly 20 years.</P><P>According to federal census figures, Lynden's population grew from 2,159 in 1950 to 2,533 in 1960. Irwin LeCocq, who oversaw that growth as Lynden's mayor for 12 years, relinquished that position in 1960. He was replaced by Jim Van Andel, who edged Lyman Judson by four votes.</P><P>Enrollment in Lynden public schools was 1,001 in September 1958, while Lynden Christian School had 887 students then. Although Lynden voters overwhelmingly rejected a public kindergarten in 1953, one began in 1957 with 52 children and 12 on a waiting list. </P><P>A Lynden High School athlete gained fame in 1953, but not in basketball. Charles "Chuck" Taubenheim, a hard throwing pitcher, became the first all-state baseball player in Lynden's history. He won all five of his games on one-hit shutouts, striking out 79 in 36 innings.</P><P>Sol Lewis, publisher of The Lynden Tribune for nearly 40 years and nationally known for his witty, grassroots sense of humor, died June 15, 1953 at the age of 64.</P> <P><A HREF="hist10.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1961 - 1970 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

Farmers Mutual Telephone Co. was bought out in 1962 and changed its name to the Washington Telephone Co. in 1963. Valley Motor Co. closed in 1965 after 30 years of business.</P> <P>William Waples, founder of the Lynden Department Store, died in 1962.</P><P>On the addition list, Fisher Elementary School opened in March 1963. Lynden Christian kept pace by building its new high school, which was dedicated in August 1964. It was reported that 1964 building permits set an all time record with $793,162 worth of building approved. </P><P>A public library and fire station were opened in 1970, and Peoples State Bank opened its current building that year. </P><P>Sears also opened in Lynden in 1966 and cable television also came to Lynden that year. Radar as a tool for catching speeders was approved by the Lynden City Council in 1967. Lynden Transport Inc. started daily runs to Alaska in 1965.</P><P>A North Washington Implement ad for an agricultural fair at the start of 1968 talked of the coming use of computers in farming. The Lynden Chamber of Commerce studied the possibility of a Dutch theme in 1970.</P><P>One current heavyweight in the Whatcom County business ranks got his start in Lynden. David Syre, now better-known as head of the Trillium Corp., was elected Chamber of Commerce president for 1968. He also won a beard-growing contest that was part of Lynden's Diamond Jubilee celebration in 1966. </P><P>The social upheavals of the1960s made their mark in Lynden. Petitions containing 1,200 signatures objecting to LSD guru Timothy Leary's appearance at Western Washington State College were collected in one weekend in Whatcom County in 1967. </P><P>The Women's Christian Temperance Union was still active. Lynden's Dick Judson served on a committee opposing Sunday store openings in 1962 behind the theme "Save Sunday for the family." He had some influential company: David Weyerhaeuser and William E. Boeing Jr. were on the committee as well.</P><P>The Lynden Lions won three state boys' basketball championships - during the decade in 1961, 1962 and 1968, but failed to make the tournament at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma in the other years. Lynden Christian started to compete in Whatcom County League sports and placed second at the state tournament in 1965. </P><P><A HREF="hist11.html">[ Take "A Look Back" at Lynden in 1971 - 1980 ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

Several hundred acres were annexed to the city, and the Fairway Center more than doubled in size.</P><P>In 1971 Theresa Tromp Lonquist established the chess tournament bearing her name for students living in the Lynden School District.</P><P>Drug abuse among the community's youth was a rising concern, addressed in several meetings for parents and the public. </P><P>The Northwest Washington Fair grew much in attendance and in the caliber of the musical entertainers. </P><P>A customer of the Recreation Tavern, Gregorio Ortiz, 48, was shot dead in November 1972, marking the first fatal shooting in Lynden that any oldtimers could recall.</P><P>The historic Berthusen Park Barn was restored through a broad citizen campaign.</P><P>Einar Simonarson, Lynden city attorney for 37 years under five mayors, retired at the end of 1975.</P><P>A federal rule banning kids under 12 from picking strawberries provoked much opposition, but the rule stayed in effect, contributing to a decline in the local strawberry industry.</P><P>A series of levy failures in the mid-1970s forced tough budget cutting and layoff decisions on the Lynden School Board.</P><P>Alumnus and basketball star Howard Heppner was chosen the new superintendent of the Lynden School District, replacing Claude Case. </P><P>The "Six Iron Lyncs" won the state basketball title in 1976, and three weeks later coach Bill De Hoog died of a heart attack. </P><P>U.S. Customs officer Kenneth G. Ward was fatally shot as he processed traffic at the Lynden border station on May 24, 1979. Artie Ray Baker an  escapee from a California prison, was later convicted of the crime.</P><P>The Lynden Department Store closed down permanently in 1979 after 82 years of operation.</P><P>A new council-executive form of county government was implemented in 1979 and Lyndenites had prominent roles in its formation.

Over 20,000 tourists gathered in Lynden for the 1990 Holland Days festival commemorating the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945.</P><P>Travel and tourism was a major card in the county's hand, especially during Expo '86 in Vancouver, B.C. Two new border stations were built, one at Lynden and one at Sumas. </P><P>Bellis Fair, a major mall in north Bellingham, opened in 1988.</P><P>Population in the county soared over the decade, with census totals for Lynden at 5,700, a 42 percent rise over 1980 figures.</P><P>Growth in the county forced four school districts to send bond issues to voters, all of which passed. Two new schools were built in the Lynden School District and others were planned in the Mount Baker, Meridian, Nooksack Valley and Lynden Christian school systems.</P><P>Lynden again grappled with annexation issues and authorized a comprehensive plan for growth.</P><P>The Northwest Washington Fair, under the direction of Richard Waldemar, saw great changes during the 1980s. From 1983 to 1990, attendance at the fair rose from 150,000 to over 200,000. Waldermar resigned in 1990 and passed away in early 1991.</P><P>The decade also saw the loss of veteran plowman Cornie Verduin and two murders, Fannie Slotemaker in 1980 and Marty Anker in 1989.</P><P>There were also major floods in 1989 and 1990 and a major snowstorm in 1981. </P><P><A HREF="hist13.html">[ View More Historic Photographs ]</A></P><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif"></P><P><A HREF="#top"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A></P><HR><P>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |</P><HR><!--%counter(lyndentrib )--><BR><P>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

Baker is the loftiest and most visible show piece of Whatcom County. At 10,775 feet, it's one of the highest mountains in the Cascade range and on a clear day can be seen from as far away as Victoria, B.C. and even Seattle. </P><P>Thankfully, the small local population keeps the mountain and the surrounding area relatively pristine. The north west section of North Cascades National Park, which punches into the eastern half of Whatcom County, contains some of the most rugged wilderness in the state. </P><P>The mountain offers plenty of recreational activities, including excellent day hike, backpacking and climbing opportunities. For the seasoned climber looking for a greater challenge, Mt. Shuksan's 9,127-foot craggy peak stands nearby and also is a favorite for photographers. </P><P>The area provides hundreds of excellent hikes. Hiking maps and friendly advice can be picked up at any of the outdoor stores in Bellingham or by calling the U.S. Forest Service Glacier Public Service Center at (360) 599-2714. The center, located on State Route 542 (Mount Baker Highway) just a mile east of Glacier, is open from 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Thursday through Monday during the summer. </P><P>Also, the Mt. Baker Ski Area attracts downhill skiers and snowboarders from Thanksgiving Day through March. For general information, call (360) 734-6711; for a ski report call (360) 671 -0211. </P><P>Several of the most beautiful sites along the highway, which takes motorists from Bellingham along the length of the Nooksack River valley to the foot of Mt. Baker, include: <DL>    	<DT>*Nooksack Falls, which drops 170 vertical feet, is located just seven miles east of Glacier.     	<DT>*Towering Douglas firs at least 600 years old. Known as the "Grove of the Druids," this stand of trees is found just after the 37-mile marker.     	<DT>*Picture Lake and Artist Point are easily the most impressive viewpoints that can be reached by car. The lake, famed for its mountain reflection, is just below the ski lodge. Follow SR 542 to its terminus, about 3.5 miles past the ski area, to reach Artist Point. This stretch of road is usually cleared of snow from July through October, however a dense snowpack may keep the road closed until late July.</DL><P>Another of the area's popular attractions is Silver Lake Park, which has good hiking, camping and fishing opportunities. Call (360) 599-2776.</P><A HREF="commun.html">[ Return to Community Info Menu ]</A><P><IMG SRC="image/line.gif" ALT="[--------------------------------------------------------------------------]" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=1></P><A HREF="civic.html"><IMG ALT="TOP" BORDER="0" SRC="image/top.gif"></A><P><HR>| <A HREF="index.html">HOME</A> |  <A HREF="top.html">TOP STORY</A> | <A HREF="spot.html">NEWS SPOTLIGHT</A> |<BR><HR>| <A HREF="hist.html">LOCAL HISTORY</A> | <A HREF="commun.html">COMMUNITY INFO</A> | <BR><HR>| <A HREF="cont.html">CONTACT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="about.html">ABOUT THE TRIBUNE</A> | <A HREF="subscribe.html">SUBSCRIBE</A> |<HR>Copyright &copy;1996 <A HREF="mailto:lyndentrib@nas.com">Lynden Tribune</A>, lyndentrib@nas.com<BR>Lynden, Washington, USA<BR></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

<P><B>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</B>
<P>
That LQG and Kalman theory are history, what the new theory is all about, where it's likely to go, and how to use it to design your own regulators and observers.


<P><B>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>Estimation and controls practitioners who wish to get much better performance from their systems, by merely using better feedback gain matrices.
<li>Those interested in continuing the research.  
</ul>
<font size=-1>While the material is heavily mathematical, the essential ideas in statistics, power spectra, and matrix algebra and calculus will all be covered.</font>


<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<p>
LQG theory for regulators and Kalman theory for observers both require you to believe that all process and measurement noise is white and Gaussian, when no physical noise has either property.  Further, LQG theory forces you to accept that minimizing the trace of a weighted covariance of the state variables is what's good for you, while Kalman theory relies on minimizing the trace of the measurement error weighted residuals, whose relation to engineering desires is tenuous at best.  This course is designed to show you how to design optimal regulators and observers for stationary systems, based on knowledge of the all the noise power spectra, and using performance measures that are much more sensitive to your actual engineering needs.  You will also see that, by your own measure, performance is likely to be greatly improved, relative to LQG or Kalman-derived feedback gains.  While several papers and seminars have been given on this subject, this is the first course offered on how to do it, along with the current status of the theory.  Throughout, obscure matrix relations are introduced as needed.  Caveat: This theory is all analog.  It's the oversampling limit of a system with infinite computational resources.  A discussion will be given on directions for future research.

<P><B>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>Engineering design can be viewed and analyzed as a decision-making process.
<li>How to approach engineering design as an opportunity for expression of creativity rather than as a process bound to the satisfaction of constraints.
<li>Engineering designs include both physical and nonphysical design choices, and nonphysical choices can be very important to the system performance and cost.
<li>Methods for finding nonphysical system alternatives.
<li>The objectives of engineering design and methods for determining the worth of a system design.
<li>Methods for the estimation and treatment of uncertainty and risk in engineering analysis and design.
<li>The theory of system worth functions and methods for the evaluation of system worth and comparison of alternatives under conditions of uncertainty and risk.
<li>Decision theory applied to design choices and the need for sequential decision making in complex programs.
<li>The phases in the life cycle of an engineering system and how each can be modeled.
<li>How competition affects engineering design.
</ul>

<P><B>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>This course is valuable for anyone who does engineering design, but particularly for people who want to manage engineering design, perform systems engineering, evaluate system alternatives, or perform engineering systems studies.  
<li>For the senior manager, the course will provide new insights and methods of squeezing additional value from engineering designs.  
<li>For engineers beginning their careers, the course will broaden their knowledge base and expand their horizons.  
<li>The deep theoretical understanding of engineering design that the course provides is also useful to engineering managers and in the management of technology.
</ul>

<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<p>
This unique course focuses on the theory of engineering design.  Reduced to its simplest form, engineering design consists of generating design options and selecting the preferred option.  But, simple as these steps may sound, they are very complex.  Few engineers learn how to think in a systems context that is conducive to option generation, and fewer still are taught formal approaches for comparison of options.  Further, while uncertainty and risk pervade all of engineering design, virtually no formal treatment is given to methods from related disciplines to the valuation and comparison of design options.  Topics of study include engineering microeconomics, forecasting, utility theory, reliability analysis, decision analysis, probability theory, system modeling and Monte Carlo simulation.  Implications will be drawn to program management.  

<P><B>COURSE MATERIALS:</B>
<p>Each attendee will receive a copy of the instructor's book, 'Systems Engineering: An Approach to Information-Based Design,' along with extensive notes and reference materials. 

<P>Tuition:  $995.  (Early-registration and group discounts apply)

<tr><td colspan=2>
<P><B>COURSE OUTLINE:</B>
This Course will examine engineering design as a decision-making process guided by information.  Good design requires the enumeration of a broad set of design alternatives and the selection of a preferred alternative from among this set.  Selection of the preferred alternative requires the development of expectations for each alternative and their comparison against a valid value measure.  The course topics will provide an information-based approach to doing this.  Topics include:
<ul>
<li>The creation of design alternative taxonomies
<li>The enumeration of nonphysical design alternatives
<li>Life-cycle design considerations
<li>Concepts of uncertainty in engineering models
<li>Principles of probability theory for systems engineering
<li>Monte Carlo modeling for engineering systems
<li>The role and principles of optimization in engineering design
<li>The mathematics of value and utility
<li>Von Newmann-Morgenstem utility functions
<li>Decision theory, the method of backward induction
<li>Arrow's impossibility theorem and its implications to optimal engineering design
<li>Forecasting for engineering design
<li>Engineering systems modeling
<li>Modeling system operation
<li>Modeling for information
<li>Defining and measuring the state of information
<li>The systems engineering process
</ul>
Through this course, you will learn how to enumerate system alternatives and how to model them.  You will learn how to incorporate uncertainty explicitly in system models.  You will learn how to create valid measures of system worth, including measures of system worth that are valid under conditions of uncertainty and risk.  And you will learn how to make wise system choices based on comparison of alternatives in terms of measures of worth.  You will learn to recognize and quantify risk in various design alternatives, and how to control risk.

<P><B>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>This course will provide an overall view of the means to design and analyze the thermal control of various types of satellites from communication satellites in geosynchronous orbits to mini-satellites in low Earth orbits.

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>System Analysts
<LI>Program Managers
<LI>Project Managers

<LI>all mechanical and aerospace structural engineers that do not have an adequate background in aerospace thermal analysis.</ul>


<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<p>As satellite design-lives are extended, and the power of communication equipment is increased, the problem of satellite thermal design becomes increasingly significant.  Cost is now an overriding consideration, and system designs must be right the first time with little or no margin.  It is imperative to define and understand the "worst case" parameters during the initial design phases of a program, to avoid unpleasant and costly changes later.  This course has been designed for managers and engineers requireing a working knowledge of analysis of thermal factors in the design of satellites, and the design and implementation of thermal control hardware and systems.  The course presents the basic laws of conduction and radiation heat transfer and illustrates how those laws apply to spacecraft.  Boundary conditions, in terms of external fluxes and internal power dissipation, are introduced and the means for obtaining temperature fields are discussed.  Comparisons are made between finite differences and finite element methods of solution.  Short cut, "back of the envelope", and worse case approximations are emphasized so that approximate or limited results may be obtained early in a program.  Active and passive hardware and/or design solutions are presented; and the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches are discussed.  Actual satelllite thermal design case studies are reviewed and practical applications are emphasized.

<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<p>
This new three-day course takes a detailed look at the propulsion requirements for launch vehicles, the trades necessary  to establish propulsion system characteristics, and the current status of potential engines and motors.  This is not an engine/propulsion design course, per se, but rather seeks to define the relationship between propulsion systems and both the vehicles into which they are integrated and the system requirements that determine their characteristics.  Course emphasis is on those propulsion systems that are options for new or upgraded vehicles and includes liquids, solids and air breathers.  The current interest in new launch vehicles is largely driven by the perceived need to reduce the cost of putting payloads into orbits for a broad range of payload sizes and orbital parameters.  This course will examine all aspects of the propulsion contribution to these costs, and will consider all aspects of operability as a key driving parameter in propulsion system selection and trade study outcomes.  The larger reusable vehicles currently being studied require far tighter integration among the main engines, the vehicle propulsion systems, and auxiliary propulsion than previously needed.  Hardware integration topics will be examined at length.

<B>Summary:</B>
<P>This course stresses the detailed end-to-end systems methodology and 
processes to design, build and operate satellites, and interface with ground
 stations and users.  The many parts of a command and control (C2) system define the systems 
engineering problem.  Genesis of the system from the highest level customer 
requirements all the way to training the operational crews and performing 
mission operations is addressed.  An example model design is presented, a hybrid 
system based on 30 years of incrementally proven pioneering techniques.  
The associated design elements are immediately applicable to a variety of C2 
problems.  Of primary interests are the modular, data base driven, common and shared 
functions, i.e., "do it once, use it over and over"  and state determination and automation.  
Significant mission operations (normal and contingency) can be accomplished through the application of the rules presented.  Characteristics are discussed which allow for growth and change at minimum cost.  Savings have been proven many times, major changes were rapidly absorbed by little more than adding a few rules to the data base, and algorithms to the unique library.  Thus, many coding problems have been subsumed by engineers building data bases.  
Special attention is given to the human/machine interface (HMI), for both operators at their mission consoles and developers generating the data base.

<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<p>
This is the only professional symposium which provides you with the latest technical information on international launch site capabilities for accommodating orbital space vehicles.  In most cases, senior technical representatives from each of the launch sites will present the detailed descriptions of the facilities under discussion.  Detailed knowledge of these launch facility capabilities, and pre-launch processing techniques will provide the information and insight needed for determining the technical suitability of specific launch sites for specific missions.  In addition to the various continental U.S. spaceports, those launch facilities operated by foreign space interests will be included.  Recognizing that Space Station logistical support will also be conducted from launch sites in Russia (Ukraine), Japan, and French Guiana, it is quite appropriate that these non-U.S. facilities, commercially competitive (albeit subsidized) as they are, be included in this symposium.  Invited technical speakers, in addition to those representing U.S. space centers and spaceports, include those from Japan (NASDA), Europe (Arianespace), China (Great Wall Industries), Russia (RSA), and the Ukraine.  

<P><B>COURSE MATERIALS:</B>
<p>All attendees will receive a bound copy of the material furnished by the speakers, as well as the latest edition of the International Reference Guide to Space Launch Systems, published and distributed by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

<P><B>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>The constituents of the solar system and their ephemerides
<LI>Basic and advanced concepts of 2-body orbital mechanics, including solutions to Lambert's and Kepler's problems, posigrade and retrograde trajectories, and multi-rev and n-pi transfers.
<LI>Properties and constraints of various types of target encounters, such as swingbys and orbiters of massive bodies and flybys of and rendezvous with comets and asteroids.

<LI>Methods for composing complex, multi-leg missions using traditional and non-traditional orbit transfer concepts.
<LI>The construction and effective use of porkchop plots.
<LI>Basic concepts of low-thrust trajectory analysis and optimization for heliocentric missions.
</UL>

<P><B>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>Mission design and optimization define the environment within which spacecraft systems and
subsystems must work and also dictate the propulsion requirements. This course will help
spacecraft engineers and managers understand the available mission design options that can
influence spacecraft design and possibly improve the probability of mission success. The course is a must for mission designers and trajectory analysts who are developing Discovery mission proposals or working on the Clementine II, New Millennium or other solar system exploration programs.
</ul>

<td valign=top>
<P><B>SUMMARY:</B>
<P>This new course focuses on concepts and methods used to design, optimize and analyze
heliocentric trajectories that are typical for the exploration of our solar system.  Particular
attention is given to missions of current interest, which are strongly influenced by the "faster, cheaper, better" thrust of prevailing space policy.  The funding ceiling that currently applies to all solar system exploration missions imposes severe restrictions on spacecraft size and the amount of propulsion that can be carried.  In response, analysts have become more creative and innovative in designing missions.  The objective is to take maximum advantage of natural forces and phenomena to minimize propulsion requirements.  This leads to more complex trajectories whose computations require specialized techniques.  You will learn many of these techniques and the underlying principles on which they are based.  A modern, graphically oriented mission analysis and optimization software system known as MAnE(TM) will be used to demonstrate concepts and explore several missions of current interest that employ conventional propulsion.  An introduction to methods used for low-thrust trajectory analysis and optimization, typical of those which might be used for the recently announced New Millennium project, will also be included.  Each attendee will receive a diskette containing a copy of a recent release of JPL's DASTCOM3 file of asteroids and comets, which contains over 12,000 entries, and software that allows one to interrogate and explore the contents of the file.


<P><B>COURSE MATERIALS:</B>
<P>Course notes, reference materials and a software program, developed by the instructor to explore the JPL ephemeris file of nearly 12,000 asteroids and comets, will be supplied to attendees, along with extensive notes and reference materials.

<p>Tuition: $995 (Early registration and group discounts apply).

<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<P>This is the only professional development course which brings you up to date on all the subtleties of a commercial space constellation design, and the impacts of constellation configuration on the spacecraft design.  Mission requirements drive the constellation selection process, and they include payload needs and program financial constraints.  Specifically, cost considerations associated with launch vehicle performance must be considered.  Similarly, payload requirements typically drive both the spacecraft pointing and power requirements, directly affecting attitude control.  These then impact the vehicle propulsion, thermal and TT&C performance. Implementation of the design choices to resolve these issues is directly effected by the unique considerations associated with the LEO orbit configuration selected.  Methods for resolving these systems considerations are presented, based on current and projected commercial space technologies.  

<P><B>COURSE MATERIALS:</B>

<P><B>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</B>
<p>
All aspects of pyrotechnic applications will be addressed--functional principles, safety, testing, demonstration of functional margins, integration, and lessons learned.  
An approach will be presented that allows reliability predictions in excess of 99% with no more than 10 functional tests. 


<P><B>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:</B>
<P>
All personnel participating in aerospace pyrotechnic applications, including administration, safety, engineering design, production, quality and reliability. 


<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<p>
This is the first course oriented toward removing the 'art' from the application of pyrotechnic devices.  In the past, pyrotechnic devices were considered off-the-shelf hardware that must be treated as 'black boxes.'  These devices defied the ability of performance measuring methods (due to extreme dynamics) and consequently were exempt from requirements to determine the effects of system variables and to quantify functional margins.  In addition, the apparent inability of designers to apply personal training in other energy sources such as hydraulics, pneumatics and electrical, increased the reluctance to use them.  When failures occurred, this lack of functional understanding left designers with little choice for resolution, but to add more explosive energy and continue go/no-go testing (it did or did not function as required).  This course addresses these concerns by offering engineering logic, with examples, for all aspects of pyrotechnic design, development, and qualification.  Included are approaches to demonstrate functional reliability with less than 10 units, how to manage pyrotechnic-unique requirements, and methods to assure that the system is properly assembled and will perform the required task.

segment of space activity.   The course begins with mission design stressing the interplay of
requirements and spacecraft capabilities which allow maintenance of a very low cost program.  
We examine the managerial and technical approaches which do not scale to small programs, and
present the alternative techniques which have proven successful.  Every aspect of a mission is
affected by its size and budget, and the course treats each technological area, first reviewing the fundamental principles, and then their application to microspace products.   Technical topics include: rocket propulsion and space transportation both earth-to-orbit and for on-orbit maneuvering and control; orbit mechanics; magnetics; radios and communications; thermal and structural analysis and design; attitude control; digital systems including CPUs and memory, software development and software/hardware tradeoffs; deployable and other mechanisms and electric power systems.  Spacecraft development techniques, parts selection rationale including handling radiation effects and parts qualification requirements and typical mission development timelines are presented.  The course concludes with a look forward at likely new missions and enabling technologies most important to microsatellites. 

<P><B>COURSE MATERIALS:</B>
<P>Included are: a complete set of lecture notes, the new textbook by the instructor, "Micro Space Craft," plus extensive reference materials by the instructor and others.

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>The general characteristics of nuclear (ionizing) radiation and how it interacts with 
living matter, as well as important spacecraft components. 
<li> The types and levels of ionizing radiation that may be encountered during future long-duration space missions - 
with special emphasis on lunar surface operations and expeditions to Mars.  
<li>Radiation countermeasures. 
<li> Recommended exposure limits for future space activities.

<P><B>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:</B>
This seminar will serve space mission planners, aerospace engineers, and astronaut candidates who need to have 
a general technical understanding of the radiation environment of outer space and how it might impact 
future extended missions on the lunar surface, to Mars, and beyond. Ionizing radiation 
cannot be sensed by the human body, yet it clearly poses a major limit to the establishment 
of a permanent human presence in space in the next millennium. 

<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<P>This is a unique course that provides a broad technical treatment of the principles 
and techniques of nuclear (ionizing) radiation protection within the context of 
future space missions (both human and robotic) that will be undertaken in the next 
millennium.  Special attention is drawn to the fact that ionizing radiation and its 
biological effects pose a major challenge to the future of human space flight.  
For crewed spacecraft outside the Earth's magnetic field, the main element of this  
risk, other than the sporadic and unpredictable large energetic solar particle 
events (SPEs), is constituted by the highly charged, energetic (HZE)-particles in 
galactic cosmic rays.  Astronauts exposed to ionizing radiation in space have an 
increased risk of genetic mutations or contracting cancer later in life.  This risk of 
experiencing deleterious biological effects increases with the radiation dose and with 
the length of exposure.  Crew exposure guidelines for extended missions to Mars and at 
a lunar surface base will be discussed within the framework of NCRP Report No. 98, 
Guidance On Radiation Received In Space Activities.  The effect of the space radiation
environment on sensitive equipment and spacecraft components is also treated. 
As a special feature, this course also introduces the major aspects of aerospace nuclear 
safety - the critical discipline dealing with the safe use of either radioisotope or 
nuclear reactor sources on future space missions to the Moon, Mars or beyond.

<P><B>COURSE MATERIALS:</B>

<P><B>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>A clear grasp of the intimate effect of political decisions on program viability and survival, construction schedules, technological choices, management structures, and of the resultant imperative to 'design the politics in.'
<li>An understanding of the pivotal importance of a strong constituency.  A clearer understanding of the components of an effective constituency.  An enhanced ability to seek and identify potential constituents in support of the program.
<li>Basic 'coping skills' for understanding, communicating, and dealing with the political system more effectively.  A grasp of its information needs, its motivations, objectives and procedures, all of which differ widely from those of engineering and science.
</ul>

<P><B>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>Professional engineers and scientists involved with publicly-funded high-technology programs.  
<li>Middle and upper managers looking to expand their skills in dealing with the complexities of program design and viability in an increasingly politicized and budgetarily constrained environment.  
<li>Policy makers concerned with the continued technological health and standing of the United States in the coming century.
</ul>

<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<p>
High-tech, high cost, high-profile programs are more than major engineering challenges; they are equally demanding political challenges.  Anyone involved in high-tech design and engineering today must know how to cope effectively with the political process. The alternative is to be continually blindsided by political events and worse still, never to understand why.
<p>
This course focuses on the 'fire zone' between the political process and the engineering design process.  Its basic thrust is that the political system is a determining design factor in any high-tech, high-cost, high-profile program because the political process defines what is affordable, and therefore possible.  It illustrates how profoundly the political decision-making process differs from the engineering-design process, and how intimately that political context will shape program viability and hardware design.  Consequently, the program's success depends importantly on its manager's ability to 'design the politics in.'  The presentation begins with an overview of the political process, leading you through the labyrinthine politics of the budgetary process which determines program funding each year.  Specific emphasis is placed on the Congressional appropriations process, because that is what determines the yearly funding without which the program cannot survive.  The objective here is to help the student understand how to communicate with the political process more effectively in support of their programs.  A group of in-depth case studies (e.g., Space Station Freedom, the Superconducting Supercollider and the National Aero-Space Plane), show how political decisions repeatedly influence engineering and technological decisions, making choices in terms of a radically different logic system than that of science and engineering.  It is imperative that the successful design engineer comprehend this process thoroughly.

<P><B>COURSE OUTLINE:</B>
<ol>
<li><b>Introduction to the 'Facts of Life,'</b> the organizing concepts of this course.  These provide a roadmap for understanding and navigating the political shoals that imperil and repeatedly defeat high-technology undertakings.
<li><b>The Political Process.</b>  How Washington works (or doesn't).  The dynamics of the political system ('It Ain't Nuthin' Like You Learned In School!') with emphasis on the Congressional appropriations process, which giveth and taketh away funds.  Preliminary coping skills for the modern design engineer.
<li><b>Space Station Freedom.</b>  The political and design history to date of the International Space Station: a classic study of The Facts of Life in action.  An exceedingly ambitious project whose turbulent history demonstrates the perils of forgetting to 'design the politics in' from the beginning.  The manner in which political pressures have repeatedly and fundamentally altered the station's physical design, and the sometimes paradoxical political cross-currents that eventually won relative program stability for a design radically different from the original one.
<li><b>Superconducting Supercollider.</b>  Big Science in action: the pros at work at least at first.  A classic study in the political techniques of mustering what was initially a powerful, durable and effective constituency for a multi-billion-dollar project in tight budget times.  The political shifts, largely unrelated to the project's intrinsic scientific and engineering merit, that led to the project's abrupt termination.
<li><b>National Aerospace Plane.</b>  NASP:  A superbly ambitious undertaking in basic research, disguised as an airplane.  The political dynamics that forced this essentially ill-fitting 'disguise' as the price of granting funding, and the resultant costs to the essential research goal. The collapse of the NASP constituency as budgets tightened in the mid-1980s, leading to the program's termination.
<li><b>The V-22 Tiltrotor 'Osprey.'</B>  The program that wouldn't die.  The fascinating story of a constituency so skillfully and meticulously built and broadened that the program managed the seemingly impossible, i.e., successfully weathering four straight years of intense opposition from both its putative customer, the Defense Department, and the Bush White House.  The essential lessons to be learned from this remarkable political success story.

<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<P>The purpose of flying satellites is to carry instruments for various purposes--to do 
scientific and reconnaissance work, to provide communication links, to perform weather 
observation--and all of these require that the attitude of the satellite be controlled 
to point antennas and sensors.  The choice of a stabilization scheme for a satellite 
depends upon many factors, including pointing stability and absolute accuracy required, 
the disturbance environment, and the cost in $ vs. the budget (whether one is building an 
arc-second space telescope, or is interested in an expensive package whose pointing 
requirements may be quite modest).  We will discuss many aspects of attitude control systems, 
including the criteria for selecting stabilization schemes, tradeoffs in sensor and actuator 
hardware, and how these choices may be made in light of the satellite mission requirements.  
We will also discuss current satellites, the future of attitude determination and control
systems, and historically interesting cases dating back to the first artificial Earth 
satellites.  In covering these examples, we will use the ATTDES software for trade studies and performance prediction.

related to the design analysis for light-sats, including space astronomy and 
surface mapping missions.  Dr. Mackison develops and teaches courses in Control Systems, CACSD, and Aircraft Design 
in the Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  He has 
worked at the Ball Aerospace Corporation, the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins 
University, and NOAA.  Dr. Mackison's course in Computer Aided Control System Design at 
the University of Colorado has been very successful in creating a working knowledge 
for students who are interested in the application of multivariable control theory to 
aerospace controls problems.  He makes extensive use of MATLAB and a broad subset of MATLAB 
toolboxes. His consulting experience spans government agencies and aerospace firms in support 
of design and analysis of satellite systems.  Dr. Mackison is the author of many papers, 
as well as the text, 'Computer Aided Control Systems Design Using MATLAB.'

<P><B>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>An overview of the equations of rigid and flexible body dynamics
<li>How finite element (FE) codes work.
<li>An overview of structural dynamics analysis techniques.
<li>The basics of the numerical analysis techniques imbedded in most existing structural and structural dynamic software currently in use on large complex systems (decomposition, extracting eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forward time integration methods).
<li>Derivation of model modification techniques based on available test data or design goals.
<li>How to compute the sensitivity of eigenvalues and eigenvectors efficiently for changes in model mass and structural stiffness parameters.
<li>The how and whys of Lanczos Vector based algorithms.
<li>How to extract accurate solutions in spite of problems associated with ill-conditioned equations.
</ul>

<P><B>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<li>Analysts responsible for finite element model development and supervisors responsible for the integrity and performance of the space hardware which their personnel are designing and analyzing.  
<li>In addition, program managers who require a technical overview of what analytical tools and techniques are available to help solve complex and realistic structural dynamic problems efficiently.
</ul>

<td valign=top>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<P>This course offers an in-depth overview of analytical and numerical methods used on aerospace structures subjected to dynamic loads.  These methods form the basis of most existing large computer programs in general use for setting up and solving complex structural dynamic problems.  After laying the theoretical groundwork, the course shows how to go from model idealization to a numerical solution, including the mathematical and numerical concepts involved, as well as their efficiency and potential for accuracy.  Assumptions built into the various methods, why and how they work, and their limitations are discussed.  Extensions into design optimization, correlation of analyses with structural dynamic test results, and math model improvement methods are treated.  The goal of this course is to help engineers to intelligently model structures and to help them and their managers to interpret the numerical results obtained by existing software, as well as to extend that software into important areas of design improvement, parameter sensitivity, and math model confidence.


<P><B>COURSE MATERIALS:</B>
<p>Include extensive notes, reference materials, and a 200-node NASTRAN CD for the first 20 registrants.

<P>Tuition: $995.  (Early-registration and group discounts apply)

<P><B>INSTRUCTOR:</B>
<b>Irving U. Ojalvo, Sc.D.,</b> is an engineering consultant (Sikorsky, United Technology, Grumman, Westinghouse, etc.) and retired professor (University of Bridgeport and Columbia University) with 35 years of combined experience equally divided between aerospace and teaching.  He served as lead analyst on numerous NASA and Air Force study programs while with Grumman Aerospace and Perkin Elmer Corporations, and worked on the Lunar Module (LM), Space Shuttle, Princeton Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) and the Hubble Space Telescope (ST).  Dr. Ojalvo pioneered numerical computation procedures for the practical use of Lanczos Vectors for calculating eigenvectors and their derivatives in large dynamic systems, as well as Epsilon Decomposition for ill-conditioned equations.  He also created software for establishing structural integrity during launch and reentry of spacecraft.  Additionally, he developed math model updating algorithms based on actual test data which have also been used to optimize current aerospace hardware.

The compact, but powerful, SA Series has a streamlined profile, reduced <BR>interference zones, and a 36% smaller footprint than earlier models. The SA Series <BR>also eliminates parallel linkage, resulting in space-saving robots and increased <BR>flexibility. Despite their reduced size, the SA robots deliver more power and a larger <BR>work envelope than many conventional robots. Additionally, the SA Series lowers <BR>maintenance needs through fewer grease points and longer-life components. The SA <BR>robots reduce cable and hose wear by incorporating a built-in air hose, with built-in <BR>I/O connections, a water hose, and a primary welding cable optionally available. <BR>Finally, to ensure accuracy, the SA Series has improved repeatability, from 0.5 to <BR>0.3 millimeters. </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>The Series includes the SA100, SA130, SA160 and SA200 models (shelf mounts <BR>available). </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Innovative SA Series Features: <BR><BR>     Space-saving design <BR>     Large working envelope <BR>     Improved accuracy and speed <BR>     Fewer grease points <BR>     Reduced cable and hose wear <BR>     Lightweight design </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Robot Applications: </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>     Spot welding <BR>     Material handling <BR>     Machine loading and unloading <BR>     Sealing <BR>     Deburring <BR>     Palletizing </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>

There's absolutely no obligation and the only costs to you is the shipping of your parts to and from our facility. </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Allowing us to weld your part will give you a good idea of our capabilities, the robots capabilities and it also provides both of us with valuable information concerning: Return On Investment, tooling design, cycle time, process requirements, workcell configuration, accessibility issues, etc. </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>There's nothing to lose and much valuable information to gain, so put us to the test.

Repeatability
</FONT></B></P>


<A NAME="370">
<P ALIGN=LEFT>

One of the most frequent "challenges" with a robotic setup is repeatability. When start points are off, programers blame the parts, the foreman blames the robot, and so on. One way to solve this problem is to incorporate an automated repeatability checker.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>This is a very simple setup. On the end of the robot's wrist, drill a hole for a 3/16' dowel which needs to extend about 1/2' from the wrist. On a stand within the working envelope of the robot, install a limit switch with a matching dowel. Program the robot to have the dowel on the wrist align to the dowel on the switch. If proper contact is made, an IO allows the robot goes on to weld the part. If alignment is not made the robot stops and the operator knows that there's a problem with the robot's repeatability. If the switch is made and points are still off, then the problem could be torch alignment, tooling, parts, etc. </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>This is one way to verify repeatability automatically, in a "pro-active" manner. Next week we'll discuss other method's.

Like they say, "the proof's in the pudding".</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>If you are considering welding automation at your facility, send us your un-welded part or a mock-up of your part and we will program and weld it on a robotic workcell that is best suited for your needs. We'll video tape the robotic welding demo and send to you the tape along with a detail report of the demo. There's absolutely no obligation and the only costs to you is the shipping of your parts to and from our facility. </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Allowing us to weld your part will give you a good idea of our capabilities, the robots capabilities and it also provides both of us with valuable information concerning: Return On Investment, tooling design, cycle time, process requirements, workcell configuration, accessibility issues, etc. </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>There's nothing to lose and much valuable information to gain, so put us to the test.

Repeatability
</FONT></B></P>


<A NAME="547">
<P ALIGN=LEFT>

One of the most frequent "challenges" with a robotic setup is repeatability. When start points are off, programers blame the parts, the foreman blames the robot, and so on. One way to solve this problem is to incorporate an automated repeatability checker.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>This is a very simple setup. On the end of the robot's wrist, drill a hole for a 3/16' dowel which needs to extend about 1/2' from the wrist. On a stand within the working envelope of the robot, install a limit switch with a matching dowel. Program the robot to have the dowel on the wrist align to the dowel on the switch. If proper contact is made, an IO allows the robot goes on to weld the part. If alignment is not made the robot stops and the operator knows that there's a problem with the robot's repeatability. If the switch is made and points are still off, then the problem could be torch alignment, tooling, parts, etc. </P><P ALIGN=LEFT>This is one way to verify repeatability automatically, in a "pro-active" manner. Next week we'll discuss other method's.

</FONT></FONT>-Welding power source is integrated in the robot controller-
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Reduced installation space-Provides a compact efficient floor space
design. </LI>

<LI>Simple and easy system configuration eliminates complicated and cumbersome
cabling - Reduces Maintenance problems. Conventional interface box is completely
eliminated - Provides a high level of direct communication between the
power supply and robot controller. </LI>

<LI>Robot controller can completely control the welding power source. A
separate on-off operation or the need to properly set the power supply
<BR>
for robotic operation is not required eliminating nuisance errors. High
speed wire stick release function can reduce the welding arc ending sequence
time up to 20%. With the AW-005C/CLs', robots ability to control the power
supplies response exactly there is a new level of control available on
each step not previously available in conventional systems such as; <BR>
a) Wire Slow Down (used to control wire striking characteristics) <BR>
b) Fresh Tip Treatment Level (used to virtually eliminate the &quot;ball&quot;
at <BR>
the end of the wire.) <BR>
c) Hot Start Voltage (Maintains higher voltage during the arc strike to
<BR>
insure successful arc initiation) <BR>
d) Burn Back Time Limit (Precisely co-ordinates with wire deceleration
<BR>
characteristics to prevent wire sticking in the crater.) </LI>
</UL>

<P>In initial system set up, the AW-005C/CL can also provide the additional
capability of adjusting the dynamic response artificial intelligence variables
of the power supply so as to minimize spatter and lower after welding clean
up time and costs. The power supplies response can be <BR>
changed for optimum performance with O.9mm (0.035&quot;) 1.2mm (0.045&quot;)
wire and for argon based shielding gases or 100% CO2. <BR>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Highly efficient and quality welding
control functions are added. </FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI>Weld Monitor Function-Can provide improve quality by providing S.P.C.
data to internally or externally. Upper and Lower limits of amperage and
voltage can be set and the function can activated on individual program
steps. If the limits are exceeded, a notification signal is generated.
</LI>

<LI>Real welding amperage and voltage can be displayed on the teach pendant,
so it is easy to confirm the welding amperage and voltage at hand. In case
of Relative method, preset amperage and voltage are at the center of the
display bar, so it is easy to recognize the divergence from the preset
amperage and voltage. If Absolute method is chosen, the left end of the
display bar becomes &quot;O&quot; and measured values are displayed as
absolute values. </LI>

<LI>Tip Monitoring capability is provided in Advanced functions. It can
minimize quality rejects by alerting the operator to change tips at the
appropriate time. The function timing can be set to activate by total welding
time, the number of arc starts, or specific job count. </LI>

<LI>In order to achieve the best arc stability, the torch degree has been
set at 45 degree. </LI>

<LI>Newly added functions make system integration easy. &quot;Welding Off
Input&quot; permitting &quot;dry run&quot; operation -By using outside
signal, welding Off operation is possible. &quot;Program reset&quot; -When
necessary, hold the operation of the robot and finish the execution forcibly.
</LI>

<LI>New commands controlling the robot minutely are added. &quot;Smooth&quot;,
&quot;Acceleration &amp; Deceleration&quot; &quot;Reserve Job&quot;. </LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Flexible and Easy Programming for
New or Experienced Users </FONT></FONT></P>

<P>For a first time user the AW-005C/CL is simple and easy to use with
clear and easy to understand English commands. For the experienced user
and demanding applications the control is provided with a host of advanced
features. (a) Numerical selection of the operation mode is possible. (b)
&quot;Add/Change/Delete' &quot;Welding Condition&quot; &quot;PTP&quot;
and &quot;Coordinate&quot;, keys have become independent, which minimize
the key strokes. (c) &quot;Gas check&quot; and &quot;Servo on&quot; keys
are available on the teach pendant, allowing complete control at hand by
the teach pendant operation. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Welding Condition Programming Options
</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI>Welding conditions can be automatically stored in a program with only
one keystroke from a main teaching menu and freely changed or edited as
necessary. </LI>

<LI>By choosing the thickness of the plate and the configuration of joint,
standard welding conditions could be automatically selected. (a) By specifying
the thickness of the plate, configuration of the joint and foot length,
our recommended welding conditions could be selected. (b) The correct welding
conditions can be inserted into the data bank by more experienced operators
and can be accumulated and then recalled by less experienced operators
speeding program development and optimization time and improving quality.
</LI>

<LI>If the initial set up of the Unified amperage/voltage command is specified,
the controller can automatically select the proper voltage when the operator
selects welding amperage. This can greatly simplify teaching for less experienced
operators. </LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Safety and Protection </FONT></FONT></P>

<P>Electronic circuits in the controller respond quickly to a crash with
tooling to protect the robot. Rearming the torch safety circuits is done
automatically through software and does not require an operator to remember
to manually reset the safety circuits. This electronic rearming eliminates
the possibility of operator induced error from this source and subsequent
damage on the next crash. <BR>

<P>Spin Arc employs the rapid rotation mechanism to rotate the welding
tip itself. As the result, it </P>

<P>(a) shortens the arc sensing cycle, </P>

<P>(b) leads to improved penetration, patterns, </P>

<P>(c) disperses arc pressure or arc heat evenly. </P>

<P>The outstanding features of this Spin Arc welding system makes high
quality and efficient automatic welding possible. </P>

<P>Arc sensor detects changes of the welding current/voltage produced by
arc weaving inside the tip. That is, it detects current differentials between
SL and SR (hatched areas shown in the figure) as a sensor signal, and then
compensates the welding path to trace the teaching path. This Spin Arc
employs the arc rotation instead of the arc weaving to detect the changes,
which increases the sensing frequency up to 10 times more compared with
the current arc sensor That makes high-speed welding with accurate tracing
possible. </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Why can Super Small Spin Arc Sensor solve the problems</B> </LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Teaching is not required. The extreme attention to accuracy of wire
placement during system will compensate for variations. </LI>

<LI>Programming time is minimized. For curved welding, only two teaching
points are required with sensing function. (Starting and ending points.)
</LI>

<LI>Higher sensitivity. High speed welding and higher tracking ability
of the joint is achieved due to higher sensitivity. The sensitivity is
up to 5 times higher than conventional ARC SENSOR. </LI>

<LI>Excellent welding result. Spin Arc Sensor rotates the wire in the molten
pool so that smooth flat bead and good penetration shape are obtained.
</LI>

<LI>Touch sensing accuracy is improved via wire clamping mechanism to limit
wire movement during touch sensing. </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>With the flattened bead, the welding speed is improved.</B> </P>

<P>The rotation at the molten pool produced by the Spin Arc </P>

<P>(a) stops cold lap. </P>

<P>(b) flattens welding bead. </P>

<P>(c) improve the bottom shape of weld. </P>

<P>The effects of the improved bead make high speed and high current welding
possible. </P>

<HR></P>

<P><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Weaving function (6 Patterns)</FONT></B> </P>

<P>Reduce teaching time by merely indicating the starting, turning, and
ending points and weaving width. Weaving amplitude can be set either by
user defining the 2 amplitude points in teaching or by specifying a numerical
value. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Parallel shift + RT axis rotating shift function</FONT></B>
</P>

<P>With Parallel shift and RT axis rotating shift function, teaching time
can be drastically reduced when welding identical or similar parts. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Arc start re-try function <BR>
</FONT></B>Will automatically advance in the programmed direction and reinitiate
arc start sequence. When the arc is reinitiated, the robot will go back
to the original programmed start location to minimize downtime and quality
problems. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Automatic wire stick release function</FONT></B> </P>

<P>If the wire stick check function indicates that the wire is stuck in
the crater, the robot will automatically initiate a small arc to release
the wire from the crater. This can minimize nuisance downtime and keep
the systems in production. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Overlap function</FONT></B> </P>

<P>When resume welding after temporary stop of welding, the robot torch
will automatically move slightly backwards at the re-start welding. By
doing so. smooth overlap welding bead can be attained. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>External Operation Start <BR>
</FONT></B>There are 3 kinds of external job selection operation start
signals. In case of Standard method, 10 kinds of jobs can be started by
using external signal. 999 kinds of jobs can be started by using Binary
method and 399 kinds of jobs by using Binary-coded decimal code. <BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Resume function <BR>
</FONT></B>The exact state of the robot is memorized when incoming main
power is removed from the welder/robot system. When power supply recovers,
the option is given to resume the operation exactly where power was removed
or restart with a new program. This function is valuable on large multi-station
robot systems or in areas where incoming power may be unstable and power
blackouts may be common. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Tool center point calibration function <BR>
</FONT></B>Tool center point is calibrated after setting a datum point.
A simple reteaching operation will reset the tool center point saving valuable
production time in the event of a torch crash or torch replacement. There
may be no need to struggle with confirming every programs + correct operation.

Leasing is flexible<BR>Companies have different needs and different cash flows. Start-up companies typically are characterized by little cash and limited debt lines. Mature companies might have other needs: to keep debt lines free and to avoid committing to equipment that may quickly become obsolete. Leasing provides the use of the robotic system for specific periods of time at fixed rental payments. Therefore, leasing allows you to be more flexible in the management of your equipment.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Leasing is practical<BR>By leasing, you transfer the uncertainties and risks of equipment ownership to the lessor, which allows you to concentrate on using that robotic system as a part of your business.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Leasing is cost effective<BR>Robotic systems are costly and some costs are unexpected. When you lease, your risk of getting caught with obsolete equipment is lower because you can upgrade or add equipment to best meet your needs.  Leasing allows you to stay on the cutting edge of robotic technology. Sophisticated business managers have learned that the primary benefits of higher productivity and profit come from the use of equipment, not owning it.<BR><BR>Leasing has tax advantages<BR>Rather than deal with depreciation schedules, you the lessee, simply make the lease payment and deduct it as a business expense.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Leasing helps conserve operating capital<BR>Leasing keeps your lines of credit open.

Today, eight out of ten American companies lease some or all of their needed equipment.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>How can leasing help my Financial picture? <BR>You may ask why should I lease rather than take a bank loan? For one thing, leasing allows you to keep your bank lines of credit open. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) considers lease rental payments as an expense, not a debt, under many lease agreements. Another key advantage of leasing is that it permits 100 percent financing, and the term of the lease can be matched with the useful life of the robotic system from the AAA Industrial Robot Store.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>* Source of information on leasing: NBD Leasing Inc.

Let's say that the appropriate robot system for your application complete with application equipment, delivered and installed on your floor along with two weeks of programing and training, would sell for approximately $59,999.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>If you're running a two-eight hour shift operation, this complete robotic package could be leased for less than $5 per hour. Only a one month advanced deposit is normally all that is necessary to begin the lease.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Another example of a more costly workcell:</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Workcell Price: $177,000<BR>Lease: 36 months with one month rental in advance.<BR>Monthly rental: $5,124 per month or $9.85 per hour (with three shifts, 5 days a week)<BR>End of lease option: Equipment can be purchased for 10% of original cost.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>These two examples demonstrate the advantages of leasing:<BR>-  no costly down payments are required,<BR>- operating capital is conserved,<BR>- payments can be deducted as a business expense <BR>- payments are less than wages required for a manual setup</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>So you can see that leasing can be a very flexible, simple, cost effective method to acquire a robotic system. A new robotic system delivered complete on your floor for only $5 per hour! There's no better way to automate your welding.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Where do I begin?<BR>First step: At no cost or obligation to you; complete the email form and we will contact you to evaluate your application and determine the appropriate workcell configuration and requirements.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Second step: Once we have determined the appropriate workcell and requirements, we will provide to you a proposal, detailing: equipment and prices, delivery schedules, specifications, warranties and lease terms. <BR><BR>Third step: At this point you should have in your hands enough information to determine if you can justify this expenditure. If more information is required, we will gladly provide. We welcome you and your associates to come and see a demonstration of the robots for yourself and meet our personnel.

Let's say that the appropriate robot system for your application complete with application equipment, delivered and installed on your floor along with two weeks of programing and training, would sell for approximately $59,999.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>If you're running a two-eight hour shift operation, this complete robotic package could be leased for less than $5 per hour. Only a one month advanced deposit is normally all that is necessary to begin the lease.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Another example of a more costly workcell:</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Workcell Price: $177,000<BR>Lease: 36 months with one month rental in advance.<BR>Monthly rental: $5,124 per month or $9.85 per hour (with three shifts, 5 days a week)<BR>End of lease option: Equipment can be purchased for 10% of original cost.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>These two examples demonstrate the advantages of leasing:<BR>-  no costly down payments are required,<BR>- operating capital is conserved,<BR>- payments can be deducted as a business expense <BR>- payments are less than wages required for a manual setup</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>So you can see that leasing can be a very flexible, simple, cost effective method to acquire a robotic system. A new robotic system delivered complete on your floor for only $5 per hour! There's no better way to automate your welding.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Where do I begin?<BR>First step: At no cost or obligation to you; complete the email form and we will contact you to evaluate your application and determine the appropriate workcell configuration and requirements.</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Second step: Once we have determined the appropriate workcell and requirements, we will provide to you a proposal, detailing: equipment and prices, delivery schedules, specifications, warranties and lease terms. <BR><BR>Third step: At this point you should have in your hands enough information to determine if you can justify this expenditure. If more information is required, we will gladly provide. We welcome you and your associates to come and see a demonstration of the robots for yourself and meet our personnel.

<BR>

<P ALIGN=left>Many people don't think twice about the garbage they generate after throwing it away or placing it at the curb for collection. Those who do wonder what happens to their trash assume that the waste goes directly to a landfill where it  is buried and forgotten. 

<P ALIGN=left>In Lancaster County however, solid waste management officials have implemented a complex  integrated waste management system designed to employ the most environmentally reliable technology.

<P ALIGN=center><IMG WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=160 BORDER=2 SRC="trnstn.jpg"><IMG WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=160 BORDER=2 SRC="fflf.jpg"><IMG WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=160 BORDER=2 SRC="rrf.jpg">
<BR CLEAR=left><STRONG>Transfer Station, Frey Farm Landfill, Resource Recovery Facility</STRONG>
<P ALIGN=left>In 1954, the city of Lancaster and several surrounding municipalities formed the Lancaster Area Incinerator Authority to research the feasibility of a trash-burning incinerator.  After extensive study, the group decided instead to build a sanitary landfill for the disposal of refuse generated in the urban Lancaster area. Because of this   decision to landfill rather than to incinerate, the organization was renamed the Lancaster Area Refuse Authority, better known as LARA.

<P ALIGN=left>During these years, LARA operated several landfills, one on the former Lancaster Brick Company site on Harrisburg Pike, and another which was closed and capped in the late 1960's and now forms part of the Lancaster County Central Park.

<P ALIGN=left>In 1968, the Authority constructed and began using Creswell Landfill, located south of Columbia in Manor Township. The Creswell Landfill served the county's needs for 21 years before being closed and capped in 1989.  The Authority also sent waste to the Lanchester Landfill, which straddles Lancaster and Chester Counties on their northern borders In the 1980's, with waste handling becoming more sophisticated and the amount of trash rapidly increasing, LARA recognized the need for an up-to-date, comprehensive municipal solid waste management plan to address the disposal needs of the entire county. Following several years of research by a solid waste advisory committee, Lancaster County, in 1986, adopted a plan mandating a new landfill, a resource recovery facility and recycling and waste reduction programs. In addition, the Authority was renamed the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority to better reflect its mission to employ the most reliable and safe waste management technology for the   entire county. The goal was to preserve farmland that may otherwise be used up by landfilling.  

<P ALIGN=left>In 1988, when a state law regulating many aspects of solid waste management took effect, the  Authority revised the plan to include the handling of materials such as household hazardous wastes, sludge and septage, the by-products of wastewater treatment and septic systems.  To implement this plan, the Authority owns and supervises the  operation of several solid waste facilities including the Jack D. Lausch, Sr. <A HREF="trnstn.htm"> Transfer Station</A>, the <A HREF="hhw.htm"> Household Hazardous Waste Facility</A>, the Lancaster County <A HREF="resource.htm"> Resource  Recovery Facility</A> and the <A HREF="freyfarm.htm"> Frey Farm Landfill</A>. Each year, the Authority processes more than 400,000 tons of waste through these facilities. In addition, the Authority coordinates recycling programs for municipalities and local businesses.Appointed by the Lancaster County Commissioners, a Board of Directors serves as the governing body for the Authority by establishing policies and procedures and   employing staff to administer those policies. The Executive Director serves as the chief executive officer for the Authority and is assisted by a general manager. Staff members work in one of four operating divisions: administrative services, finance, operations or technical services.  The Authority employs more than 70 people, a significant change from the organization's founding with only one employee and a bulldozer.

<P ALIGN=left>In addition, the Authority directs the efforts of the Citizens Advisory Committee, also appointed by the Lancaster County Commissioners. In the past, this group has researched household hazardous waste disposal culminating in the construction of the Authority's Household Hazardous Waste Facility, and has devised a plan for the disposal of infectious waste.

<P ALIGN=left>A "user fee" system finances all Authority activities. Users pay tipping fees which cover the full cost of developing, operating and maintaining the system.  An annual financial report can be obtained by contacting the Authority office.

<P ALIGN=left>For more information or if you have questions, please contact the Authority office in Lancaster County at 717-397-9968.

<P ALIGN=left>Every year, Lancaster County residents generate in excess of 400,000 tons of garbage. In the landfill, that amount of trash would take up approximately 25 acres of space, 25 feet deep. But thanks to the resource recovery facility and county-wide recycling, less than 20 percent of that volume of waste enters the Frey Farm Landfill, whose operational life is expected to last well into the 21st century.<P>



<P ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="fflf.jpg" WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=2 ALIGN=right><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG><EM>In all, seven cells with 96 acres available for waste disposal make up the Authority's Frey Farm Landfill, located adjacent to the Creswell Landfill site in Manor Township.</EM></STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR CLEAR=left>
<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>CONSTRUCTION</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>With the closure of the Creswell Landfill in the late 1980's and the need for a new facility, the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority studied the best available technology when   designing and constructing Lancaster County's Frey Farm Landfill. Construction of the first cell of the landfill and its accompanying leachate treatment plant began in June 1988 and was completed in July 1989. The Authority filled the first 18-acre cell to capacity within 16 months. Construction on the 12-acre second cell took place in 1990. The third cell, built in 1992, has been used exclusively for wastes that cannot be processed in the Authority's resource recovery facility. In all, seven cells, with 96 acres for waste disposal, make up the Frey Farm Landfill.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>One of the Authority's primary concerns is protecting the environment surrounding the landfill.  The Frey Farm Landfill is a double-lined facility with two sets of liners designed to collect leachate before it reaches the groundwater table.  Leachate is water that seeps through the landfill picking up impurities as it travels through the bed of waste.  The bottom, or secondary, liner is made of a composite system of clay and a 60-mil high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liner.  The top, or primary, liner also is a composite section with 60-mil HDPE and bentonite subliner.  Above the primary liner and between the primary and secondary liners are highly permeable leachate collection zones designed to transport all leachate to the collection pipes.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>LEACHATE COLLECTION</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>The network of pipes in both the secondary and primary systems provides gravity flow to a perimeter pipe which transmits all flow to the lowest portion of the landfill. The primary system empties into a pump station delivering all leachate to the on-site treatment facility, while the secondary system empties into a manhole used to detect and monitor any flows within the system.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>LEACHATE TREATMENT</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>At the on-site treatment plant, the leachate enters two equalization tanks with a combined capacity of more than 500,000 gallons. The treatment plant itself is designed with two independent 25,000  gallon-per-day trains to provide a 50,000 gallon-per-day treatment capacity and to allow for continued treatment if equipment in one train requires maintenance or repairs. From the storage tanks, leachate reaches the treatment plant by gravity flow which is regulated by operations personnel to limit fluctuations in both flow and chemistry.

<P ALIGN=left>Treatment begins through a physical/chemical process in which lime and polymers (if required) are added to precipitate and remove metals.  Sludge is removed directly to a processing tank before pressure filtration.  Ammonia strippers are used if high levels of influent ammonia nitrogen are present. A neutralization system then reduces the pH of the leachate to levels complementary to biological activity.

<P ALIGN=left>Next, a two-stage aeration system is used for biological reduction of organic materials.  Clarifiers separate suspended solids and supernate. The supernate is taken through an anthracite/sand backwashing-style filter, disinfected and then discharged to Manns Run (a small tributary of the Susquehanna River) about a half-mile before it enters the Susquehanna River.  If, when tested, leachate does not meet the plant's stringent effluent standards, it can be recirculated for additional treatment.  All treatment processes are monitored both manually by employees and by automated mechanical and electrical control systems.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>MONITORING</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Surface water drainage facilities and sedimentation ponds serve the entire site.  The Authority monitors groundwater each quarter in 35 strategically placed wells (20 are located in the Frey Farm Landfill and 15 are located in the Creswell Landfill).  Landfill gases are also monitored quarterly at points around the site.  If necessary, a gas collection system could be installed as the landfill reaches capacity.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>LANDFILL FACILITIES</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Facilities at the Frey Farm Landfill include:  a scalehouse with a computerized weighing system compatible with that used at the Authority's transfer station and resource recovery facility, a maintenance facility, offices, lunchroom and locker rooms, a wood shredder installed in 1991 to process wood waste for mulch or incineration, a truck wash, a drop-off area for the delivery of several types of recyclable material, and a material screen used to separate rock and other materials from soil used as daily, intermediate and final cover material.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>LANDFILL OPERATION</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority's commitment to state-of-the-art facilities includes both their design and operation. Therefore, the equipment used at the landfill is of the highest quality and training of the landfill staff is ongoing. The Frey Farm Landfill  operates five and a half days each week with either its manager or assistant manager on site at all times. In addition, the Authority follows an in-depth  Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan for operational safety. The Employee Committee on Operating Procedures and Safety reviews operations at all Authority facilities and suggests changes and  improvements.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>THE LANDFILL'S FUTURE</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>The landfill's final use plan, which calls for the development of a natural and wildlife reserve area, should restore the area's appearance and make it compatible with the surrounding farmland and woodland.  The Authority already has taken a step toward that final use plan by establishing, with the Lancaster County Conservancy, a hiking trail around both the active and closed sections of the landfill.

<P ALIGN=left>For every ten truckloads of waste entering the resource recovery facility, only one truck filled with ash leaves for the Frey Farm Landfill.  Located in Conoy Township, south of the village of Bainbridge, the Lancaster County Resource Recovery Facility plays one of the most significant roles in the county's integrated solid waste management system.

<P ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="rrf.jpg" WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=2 ALIGN=right><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN=left><STRONG><EM>Ogden Martin Systems of Lancaster, Inc. operates the Lancaster County Resource Recovery Facility for the Authority under a 20-year service agreement.  Commercial operation of the plant began in 1991.</EM></STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR CLEAR=left>
<P ALIGN=left>After groundbreaking in March 1989 and almost two years of construction, the facility now burns solid waste, generates electricity and, most importantly, reduces the volume of the trash by 90 percent, significantly increasing the amount of valuable landfill space. Without the resource recovery facility, for example, the Frey Farm Landfill would be filled to capacity by 1998. Owned by the Authority and operated by the plant's designer, Ogden Martin Systems of Lancaster, Inc., the $105-million facility has the capacity to process up to 1,200 tons of refuse every day.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>WASTE DELIVERY</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Upon arrival, solid waste haulers cross over the Authority's computerized scales which record the weight of the refuse.  Small vehicles and those containing recyclable materials utilize a special drop-off area located outside the plant.  Larger delivery trucks enter the facility's enclosed tipping area, which is maintained under negative air pressure to prevent litter, dust and odors form escaping.  

<P ALIGN=left>After unloading their contents into either the storage pit, which holds 4,800 tons of waste, or onto the tipping floor, where a front-end loader spreads out the trash for inspection before pushing it into the pit, the trucks are weighed again as they leave the facility.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>COMBUSTION</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>An overhead crane mixes the waste in the pit before picking up three to four tons of waste and feeding one of the three independent boilers, each with a daily processing capacity of 400 tons. All three furnaces operate continuously, 24 hours a day.

<P ALIGN=left>In the furnace, a grate system,  consisting  of a  series  of  metal plates arranged in steps, mix and move the waste to ensure even and complete combustion. The waste passes through drying, burning and cooling stages before being discharged into the ash quench and conveyance system.

<P ALIGN=left>Combustion air blows under and over the waste as it moves downward on the inclined grates to support burning at a temperature exceeding 1800  degrees Fahrenheit and to mix and burn the combustion gases which significantly reduces concentrations of offensive gases from stack emissions.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Boiler water is converted into steam by the heat given off from the burning waste that warms the water in tubes surrounding the furnace. Steam, in excess of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, is piped to a turbine-generator where steam pressure spins the turbine which, in turn, is connected to a generator producing approximately 36 megawatts of electricity.

<P ALIGN=left>Four to five megawatts are used to power the plant and the rest is sold to Metropolitan Edison for  distribution to local homes and   businesses. The turbine discharges the steam, which is cooled in a condenser and returned to the boilers for additional steam production.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>WATER SOURCE</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Through the incineration process, the facility consumes  500,000 gallons of water every day for steam production, cooling, ash quenching and other uses. The source for this water is effluent, from the Elizabethtown Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was  previously discharged directly into the Susquehanna River.

<P ALIGN=left>Two ponds at the resource recovery facility each store 1.25 million gallons of treated water for use during peak demand periods  and for fire protection. The plant itself is a zero-discharge facility, which means that no wastewater leaves the property. Instead, the wastewater is treated on site and recycled within the system.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>EMISSIONS CONTROL</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Gases produced by combustion pass through the boiler where their temperatures decrease to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. After leaving the boiler, these gases pass into a dry scrubber, where they are injected with a lime slurry to neutralize the acid gases. Next, the gas enters a fabric filter baghouse for removal of particulate matter. The cleansed air then exits the stack, 305 feet above ground level.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>ASH HANDLING</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Reacted salts from the dry scrubber and the particulate matter (called flyash) combine with the bottom ash from the furnace.    An ash stabilization system treats the flyash to prevent leaching of heavy metals. Conveyors transport the ash to the residue storage building, where it passes through a ferrous metal recovery system. The  Authority sells the ferrous material to a recycling facility and hauls the  remaining ash to the landfill.

<P ALIGN=left>One of the Authority's oldest facilities is the Jack D. Lausch, Sr. Transfer Station, located  just  beyond the city limits of Lancaster at 1291 Harrisburg Pike.

<P ALIGN=left>Built in 1968, expanded in 1978 and 1984, and completely renovated in 1990, the transfer station serves as a central drop-off point for trash haulers who collect refuse within the 946 square miles which make up Lancaster County.

<P ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="trnstn.jpg" WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=2 ALIGN=right><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG><EM>At the transfer station, waste is compacted into Authority transfer trailers and trucked to either the Frey Farm Landfill or the Resource Recovery Facility.</EM></STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR CLEAR=left>

<P ALIGN=left>Every day, more than 200 commercial haulers and residents pass over the transfer station's  electronic scales which record, via computer, the amount of waste contained in each vehicle. Trash is deposited in one of four bays, where the waste is compacted into Authority transfer trailers. Each day, these transfer trailers haul approximately 800 tons of waste to either the resource recovery facility, the Frey Farm Landfill or a recycling center.

<P ALIGN=left>In addition to being centrally located within the county, the    transfer station also provides  Authority compliance officers the opportunity to inspect each load of waste to make sure the materials are acceptable and to dispatch that waste to the  appropriate disposal site. Combustible materials go to the resource recovery facility while noncombustible items are directed to the Frey Farm Landfill.

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority sends recyclables to various recycling markets, while the on-site Household Hazardous Waste Facility collects hazardous wastes generated in area homes.

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority also requires separate delivery of materials which may be better disposed through methods other than resource recovery or landfilling.  For example, all tires and white goods (household appliances) must be delivered separately from other refuse. Tires are sent to a recycling facility and white goods, after chlorofluoro- carbon gas removal, are taken to recycling centers.  

<P ALIGN=left>The transfer station includes a maintenance facility, where mechanics perform most repair  work and state inspections on Authority vehicles and equipment.  The maintenance facility also houses a tire changing room, welding shop, wash bay, paint bay and offices.

<P ALIGN=left>For the convenience of the employees who work at the transfer station, the complex includes a lunchroom and locker rooms.

Instead,  residents should take their household hazardous waste (HHW) to a collection center  specifically designed to provide a safe disposal option for hazardous waste items.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Authority began construction on Pennsylvania's first permanent HHW Facility in the Fall of 1990.  Completion of the $200,000 HHW collection center, in January 1991, represented a two-year effort by the Authority's staff, Board of Directors and the Citizens Advisory Committee. 

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Many communities hold one-day collection events throughout the year, during which time residents may bring household hazardous waste to designated  locations.  The Authority decided, however, that a permanent center with convenient hours would encourage responsible disposal of household hazardous wastes.
<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>To date,  the Household Hazardous Waste Facility has served more than 16,000 residents and collected in excess of 350 tons of material (excluding battery weights). The center  accepts wastes including, but not limited to: auto products (transmission and brake fluids, antifreeze, used oil and batteries); household cleansers; floor and furniture polish; adhesives; gasoline; kerosene; household batteries; old chemistry sets; paints and paint-related products (stains, turpentine, thinner, rust protect- ant); pesticides, herbicides, insecticides; photographic and pool chemicals. These items are accepted free of charge.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Materials accepted at the facility must be generated in the home.  Materials from schools,  businesses and farms are not accepted. Other items not accepted at the HHW Facility include:     propane tanks, radioactive waste, medical waste, explosives, and   ammunition.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Trained HHW Facility staff members sort and classify the materials before storing the waste in specially designed containment units located in the facility.  A contracted hazardous waste hauler packs the items in drums, manifests the material and sends it to a hazardous waste incinerator, landfill or other treatment facility for proper waste management. Some materials, such as used motor oil, lead-acid batteries and antifreeze
are recycled.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Authority's HHW also includes the collection of small household batteries like those from toys, cameras, flashlights, watches, and hearing aids.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>In 1991, the Authority initiated a curbside battery collection program for Lancaster County households.  The Authority provides residents with small orange plastic battery bags. When filled, the bags are placed at the curb on the same day as garbage collection.
The Authority requires waste haulers  to keep the battery bags separate from other waste collected. The bags are taken to the HHW Facility, where nonrecyclable batteries are placed in containers, sealed and sent to the Frey Farm Landfill for safe disposal. Rechargeable and buttoncell batteries are sent to a recycling facility.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Safety is of major importance in the HHW Facility. Three-hour fire-rated walls, a blast-relief shaft, a carbon dioxide fire suppression system, explosion- and vapor-proof wiring and lighting, and epoxy- coated floors for spill containment are some of the safety features included within the 960-square-foot facility.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Lancaster County's HHW Facility, located adjacent to the transfer station on Harrisburg Pike, has daytime, evening and weekend hours.  For more information or to bring materials to the center, please call the Authority office at (717) 397-9968.

<H2><P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>Landfill Reclamation</STRONG></FONT></H2>

<P ALIGN=left>One of Lancaster County's major resources is farmland. Therefore, it makes sense that one of the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority's goals is to protect land and preserve space needed for landfilling purposes.


<P ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="trommel.jpg" WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=200  BORDER=2 ALIGN=right>

<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Using a tracked dozer, a landfill equipment operator removes waste from the landfill cell and stockpiles the waste within reach of a hydraulic excavator, which feeds the trommel.  The trommell's rotating drum separates soil from the reclaimed waste, which then is burned at the  <A HREF="rrf.htm">Resource Recovery Facility</A>  .</EM></STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR CLEAR=left>
<P ALIGN=left>The Authority constructed a resource recovery facility to significantly reduce the volume of waste entering the Frey Farm Landfill, thereby prolonging the landfill's operational life.

<P ALIGN=left>In February 1991, the Authority took another step in preserving landfill space by excavating and incinerating waste buried in the first cell, whose 18 acres were filled during the time it took to construct the resource recovery facility.

<P ALIGN=left>Landfill reclamation began on a small scale with only a few hundred tons of waste reclaimed each week.  The project later evolved into an operation which used all Authority ash trucks and two open-top transfer trailers to haul some 1,300 tons of reclaimed garbage to the resource recovery facility on a weekly basis.  After three years of operation, the Authority processed nearly 189,000 tons of reclaimed waste thereby making 370,000 cubic yards of space available for reuse.

<P ALIGN=left>During its operation, reclamation allowed the Authority to achieve several goals: extend the life span of the landfill; increase energy production and efficiency at the resource recovery facility; and recover ferrous metals and cover soil.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>PROJECT DEVELOPMENT</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Since the project's conception, the Authority and Ogden Martin Systems of Lancaster, Inc., the resource recovery facility's operator, jointly determined the most efficient and cost-effective manner in which to excavate and process waste from the Frey Farm Landfill.

<P ALIGN=left>In Phase 1 of the project, the Authority excavated waste from the landfill and delivered it to the resource recovery facility, where it was mixed with municipal solid waste (MSW) at various ratios and burned.

<P ALIGN=left>Because of the large amount of cover soil material remaining in the reclaimed waste and its moisture content, Ogden Martin, in Phase 2, began supplementing the mixture of reclaimed waste and the waste received daily with other fuels (primarily propane gas, wood chips and shredded tires) to increase its energy value.

<P ALIGN=left>In Phase 3, the Authority purchased a trommel and used it to screen the majority of the cover material from the reclaimed waste.

<P ALIGN=left>After five months, the Authority bought a larger trommel with additional screening  capability to improve the screening process.

<P ALIGN=left>As a result of the work at the Frey Farm Landfill and the resource recovery facility, the Authority learned that landfill reclamation is feasible under any of the three phases described above, but that trommeling the waste makes the most economic and operational sense.

<P ALIGN=left>Because of the amount of dirt in untrommeled waste and its negative effect on combustion characteristics, the amount of such waste processable at the resource recovery facility was limited. Removing cover material from the waste produces a cleaner, more efficient fuel. It allowed the Authority to send a larger amount of reclaimed waste to the facility, producing more landfill space in the time available to operate the project. In addition,  trommeling material and maximized the efficiency of vehicles that hauled reclaimed waste to the resource recovery facility.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>PROJECT OPERATION</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Using a tracked dozer, a landfill operator removed refuse from the first cell of the landfill and stockpiled the waste within reach of a hydraulic excavator.  The excavator operator sorted noncombustible material (about five percent of the total reclaimed) and dropped the remaining waste onto the trommel's feedbelt.  The rotating drum of the trommel separated the cover material from the reclaimed waste by depositing cover soil on a stockpile by one conveyor, while a second conveyor stockpiled the screened waste.

<P ALIGN=left>Dump trucks, used for hauling ash from the resource recovery facility to the Frey Farm Landfill, backhauled trommeled waste.  Additionally, transfer trailers, which were modified for the reclamation project by replacing their hard tops with a tarping system, transported the trommeled waste to the resource recovery facility and dumped it into the plant's holding pit.

<P ALIGN=left>At the resource recovery  facility, crane operators used the grapple to mix the reclaimed waste with municipal solid waste (MSW) at a 4:1 ratio of MSW to reclaimed waste. The operators then fed the mixture into the furnaces for processing.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>PROJECT BENEFITS</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Throughout the project, both air quality and ash composition from the resource recovery facility were continuously monitored.  No negative impacts on either were recorded except for the creation of extra ash from the burning of additional waste.  However, odor and air emissions at the reclamation site, increased traffic on roads between the landfill and resource recovery facility, additional wear on the equipment and extra mixing and handling of waste at the resource recovery facility all could be  considered negative aspects of the project.

<P ALIGN=left>The benefits, however, which include reclaimed landfill space, additional energy production and recovery of ferrous metals and cover material, appear to far outweigh any negative results associated with the project.

<P ALIGN=left>In addition, the reclamation project has served as a model for other communities, both for those that simply want to add to the life of a landfill and also for those that need to eliminate or reduce the size of problem landfill sites.

<P ALIGN=left>Each home generates approximately one ton of garbage every year. In Lancaster County, that accounts for more than 400,000 tons of trash entering the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority's system.

<P ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="recycle.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=2 ALIGN=right>

<STRONG><EM>More than 35 municipalities participate in curbside recycling programs, which require the separation of newsprint and glass and metal food and beverage containers.</EM></STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR CLEAR=left>

<P ALIGN=left>One way to reduce the amount of trash requiring proper disposal is to participate in recycling.

<P ALIGN=left>More than 35 municipalities making up over 75 percent of the county's population, are served by curbside recycling   programs, which call for the weekly curbside collection of recyclables on the same day as garbage collection. Although materials collected in programs vary by community, all programs include the separation of  newsprint, and all glass and metal food and beverage cans.

<P ALIGN=left>For residents in rural communities not required to provide curbside recycling, drop-off recycling centers are available to them throughout the county. The Authority provides recycling drop-off sheds at the Frey Farm Landfill, the transfer station and at the resource recovery facility, while additional centers are sponsored by municipalities or other organizations.

<P ALIGN=left>During the past few years, recycling also has taken hold in the Lancaster County business community.  Managers have discovered that recycling makes economic sense. By reducing the amount of waste generated, waste disposal costs remain manageable. Many businesses are  interested in protecting the environment, and, in most cases, recycling is the law.  The same state legislation (Act 101), that mandates residential recycling in communities with 5,000 residents or more, also requires recycling in commercial, industrial and institutional establishments within these communities. Materials collected in offices, factories and schools vary greatly, but most include office paper, corrugated cardboard, metal cans and glass  containers.

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority has been committed to assisting municipalities and businesses in starting their recycling efforts and coordinating the development of their recycling programs. Staff members have: informed communities of their responsibility to recycle and options for implementing programs through  workshops attended by municipal officials; helped those communities plan their programs; provided model contracts, ordinances and other documents that are the foundation of a recycling program; supplied individual recycling containers for homeowners and apartment tenants; and prepared educational materials tailored to each community.

<P ALIGN=left>Apart from assistance for curbside recycling, the Authority recycling staff also assists business, industry and institutions develop and maintain recycling programs. The staff consults with businesses, both from the Authority office and on-site, and will assist such operations in evaluating what can be recycled, how it can be collected and where it can be marketed.

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority provides recycling containers to businesses and has produced several publications explaining office paper recycling and waste reduction options.

<P ALIGN=left>Recycling in Lancaster County expanded in 1991,when the Authority stopped landfilling grass clippings and leaves, waste that accounted for as much as 10 percent of the tonnage being deposited in the Authority's landfill each year.

<P ALIGN=left>Instead, yard waste is applied to agricultural land and tilled into the soil where it provides nutrients and acts as a partial replacement to fertilizer. The Authority acts as a liaison between waste haulers and farmers to  obtain sites where haulers may directly deposit yard waste for spreading on fields. For a fee, the Authority also will accept such materials and will haul them to land application sites.

<P ALIGN=left>Also in 1991, the Authority installed a wood shredder at the Frey Farm Landfill to process wood wastes for recycling or energy recovery.

<P ALIGN=left>And, recycling also occurs at the resource recovery facility where a ferrous metal recovery system at the end stage of the incineration  process screens ferrous material from the ash.   Each year, as much as 6,000 tons of ferrous metal are reclaimed and recycled.

<P ALIGN=left>For the convenience of waste haulers who may have difficulty marketing recyclable materials, the Authority accepts commingled glass and metal containers at all Authority facilities and maintains a contract with a materials recovery facility for the processing and marketing of those materials.

<P ALIGN=left>In addition, the Authority recycles and reuses other materials received at the transfer station. For example, tires are sent to a recycling processor, shredded and sold for reuse.

<P ALIGN=left>White goods (large appliances) can also be recycled. In 1992, the Authority began a program to  recover and recycle chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) found in refrigeration units. After CFC removal, white goods are sent to a recycling market where they are shredded and further processed.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>Composting</STRONG>

<P>Organic materials such as leaves, grass, and vegetable scraps are broken down by microorganisms, forming a rich soil-like substance called compost or humus.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>Keys to Successful Home Composting</STRONG>

<P><EM>Organic materials:</EM>  A good mix consists of three parts "browns" (materials such as dead leaves that are high in carbon) and one part "greens" (such as fresh grass clippings and garden prunings that are high in nitrogen).

<P><EM>Moisture</EM>:  Composting materials should feel moist, but not overly soggy.

<P><EM>Temperature</EM>:  Composting materials should feel warm to the touch except in the cold winter months.

<P><EM>Air</EM>:  To prevent unpleasant odors that can occur when materials decompose without oxygen, compost should be turned regularly to ensure that air is reaching the center of the pile.



<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>What Do You Need to Home Compost?</STRONG>

<P>All you need to compost is enthusiasm, yard or food waste (except meat or dairy products), and some space.  Compost piles don't need to be enclosed, although many people use a bin or similar enclosure.  Compost bins can be purchased or you can easily construct one with common materials such as chicken wire, snow fencing, lumber or used pallets.  Other tools that come in handy for composting are a garden hose, wheelbarrow and common garden tools.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>Getting Started</STRONG>

<P>A 4 x 4 x 4 foot area out of direct sunlight is ideal for your  compost pile.  Choose an easily accessible spot on a grass or soil base.  Composting can begin any time of the year, but many people start in the fall when leaves are abundant.

<P>Organic materials should be mixed, adding water as needed so that the materials feel like a moist sponge.  The compost pile should be turned after a few weeks so that the outside layers are exchanged with the center of the pile.  Turn compost piles about once a month, except in cold winter conditions.  Water can be added during turning, if necessary.



<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>What to Avoid</STRONG>

<P>While many yard wastes and kitchen scraps can be successfully composted, some materials should be kept out of the compost pile.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>Don't Compost</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Diseased plants or leaves
<LI>Persistent weeds (poison ivy, multiflora rose, bindweed, quack grass, etc.)
<LI>Human or pet feces

<P  ALIGN=center><STRONG>Using Compost</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Compost is ready to be used when it looks dark and crumbly and none of the starting ingredients are recognizable.  One way to test if your compost is finished is to seal a small sample in a plastic bag for 24 to 48 hours.  If no strong odors are released when you open the bag, the compost is done.

<P ALIGN=left>Compost can be applied directly around the base of trees and shrubs to serve as a mulch.  It also can be worked into the top six to eight inches of the soil to provide increased water retention and valuable nutrients.


<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>Brush and Wood Waste</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Trimmings from bushes and shrubs are usually not suitable for composting because of size.  Home chippers can be used to grind small branches and prunings for mulch, ornamental landscaping or garden pathways.  Old Christmas trees and similar brush may also be left in a secluded part of your yard to attract birds and serve as natural wildlife habitat

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>Grasscycling -- Easy Steps to a Low-Maintenance Lawn</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>Grass clippings make up a large percentage of the household waste produced each year.  About 1,000 square feet of lawn in Pennsylvania  can produce 200 to 500 pounds of clippings during the growing season.

<P ALIGN=left>A simple alternative to bagging grass clippings is "grasscycling".  Simply leave clippings on your lawn where they break down in 7 to 14 days.  The clippings act as a top-dressing fertilizer and help keep your lawn green and healthy.



<P ALIGN=left>Grass clippings also can be used as a surface mulch around vegetables or flowers to inhibit weed growth and retain soil moisture.  Remember to keep clippings at least 2 inches away from young plants to avoid "burning"  the new growth.  Put grass clippings in your compost pile to add extra nutrients.  To  avoid odors, no more than one-third of a compost pile should be made up of grass clippings.



<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>Lawn Mowing, Hedge Trimming,  Weeding  and Raking
</STRONG>


<P ALIGN =left>These simple chores produce nearly two million tons of yard waste each year in Pennsylvania.  But yard debris does not need to be dumped in landfills or processed at resource recovery facilities.  Instead, practice the 3 R's of waste management ---

<P ALIGN= left> <STRONG>REDUCE</STRONG> the amount of yard waste you create through "grasscycling"--leave grass clippings on your yard.


<P ALIGN= left> <STRONG>REUSE</STRONG> yard waste by mulching with leaves.  Chip woody materials to use as ornamental mulch or to control weeds.


<P ALIGN= left> <STRONG>RECYCLE</STRONG> yard waste and vegetable scraps by composting to produce a valuable soil conditioner.

<BR>

<P ALIGN=left>Disposing of residual waste materials can sometimes place a burden on business and industry.  Because of liability issues, industries are seeking the most environmentally safe method to dispose of their waste streams.  Many businesses have chosen incineration as a means of eliminating liability concerns. Some residual wastes, however, can only be landfilled.  Therefore, industries must locate the most responsible disposal facility to manage such waste.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR CLEAR=left>


<P ALIGN=left>With its integrated waste management system, the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority can effectively provide business and industry full accountability for the disposal of their  residual wastes.  The Authority's special waste program is unique in that it can provide: assistance in the permitting process; specialized transportation with a high degree of security by an Authority-owned fleet; and direct delivery to the Authority-owned resource recovery facility, where the waste is combusted.  In addition, the Authority owns and operates a state-of-the-art landfill, for the disposal of residue from the resource recovery facility and other noncombustible residual wastes.  

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority's Board of Directors agreed to utilize the system's assets to satisfy industrial waste disposal needs and to process special wastes.  The program supplements revenues which support Lancaster County's waste management system and, at the same time, solves a waste disposal problem for business and industry.  Participants in this program are impressed with the Authority's capability of handling wastes  in a most cost-effective and efficient manner.  Processing nonhazardous industrial waste in the Authority's resource recovery facility lowers disposal costs incurred by industries who want to utilize incineration but who previously only had the option of using hazardous waste facilities

<P ALIGN=left>Prior to acceptance into the program, industrial wastes are subjected to a high level of scrutiny by the Authority and undergo an environmental review by Ogden Martin Systems of Lancaster, Inc., the resource recovery facility's operator.  In addition, processing of each special waste must also be approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.  

<P ALIGN=left>Because the resource recovery facility operates under some of the strictest air quality permit standards, it is imperative that the waste not interfere with the plant's ability to comply with these regulations.  

<P ALIGN=left>Some of the materials currently being processed as part of the industrial special waste program include: outdated or returned manufactured goods,  pharmaceutical waste, treated wood, oil absorbent material, paint filters, ink sludges, textile wastes, paint solids, and other nonhazardous combustible industrial process residues.

<P ALIGN=left>For more information, please contact the Authority office at (717) 397-9968, Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM.

<BR>

<P ALIGN=left>Building well-designed solid waste facilities is one challenge, and operating those facilities is  another. The Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority has developed a comprehensive licensing, enforcement and reporting program to ensure the safe and efficient operation of its facilities and to protect the environment.

<P ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="l&c.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=2 ALIGN=right><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG><EM>At all Authority facilities, compliance officers check manifests and loads of waste to make certain that unacceptable materials do not enter Lancaster County's solid waste management system.</EM></STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR CLEAR=left>
<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>LICENSING</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority has established a set of rules and regulations that govern the collection and transportation of solid waste and recyclable materials. Each year, the Authority updates these regulations to reflect changes in facility operation, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection regulations, waste categorization and fee structures.

<P ALIGN=left>According to these rules and regulations, all commercial waste haulers must obtain a license for each one of their vehicles, roll-off containers and trailers. In Lancaster County, approximately 70 companies haul waste from homes, offices, factories and schools. An additional 450 customers are licensed to haul their own waste to Authority facilities. Some 30 companies haul sludge, the  by-product of wastewater treatment, and septage, the waste from septic tanks. Most of the trash haulers also collect recyclable materials and deliver them to separate facilities for processing and sale.

<P ALIGN=left>Those wishing to obtain licenses must show proof of general liability insurance, vehicle insurance and work compensation. They must also agree to abide by the Authority's rules and regulations. Licenses must be displayed on vehicles and containers.

<P ALIGN=left>By licensing waste haulers, the Authority can monitor service and operating standards. For example, if a hauler violates Authority regulations or operates unsafely, the Authority has the right to impose fines or revoke licenses.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>COMPLIANCE</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority's rules and regulations also describe what types of waste the Authority will accept at its facilities. Generally speaking, the Authority will dispose of municipal solid waste (the refuse created at homes and businesses, including  construction/demolition debris) and residual waste (created through a  manufacturing process). Most waste generated in Lancaster County falls into these categories. The Authority will not accept hazardous waste, explosives, liquid waste and radioactive materials. County facilities are not suited for these materials which can be problematic or dangerous to landfill or incinerate.

<P ALIGN=left>To ensure that waste haulers do not deliver unacceptable wastes, the Authority stations trained compliance officers at all delivery points to inspect delivery  vehicles and incoming loads.  The compliance officers watch loads of waste as they 
are dumped at the transfer station, resource recovery facility and the Frey Farm Landfill, removing  unacceptable items by hand or, if necessary, with equipment.

<P ALIGN=left>When a violation does occur, unacceptable materials are returned to the waste hauler or are disposed by the Authority at an appropriate facility, and the hauler is given a written warning or a fine. In cases of repeated violations, a waste hauler may lose disposal privileges and licenses. Charges also may be filed in Lancaster County Court.

<P ALIGN=left>In addition to inspecting wastes, compliance officers observe the operation of waste haulers throughout the county to see that all  operating vehicles and containers have permits and that all municipal solid waste generated in the county is delivered to appropriate facilities.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>REPORTING</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>All waste entering the Authority's transfer  station, resource recovery facility and Frey Farm Landfill is tracked on a special computer program.  Part of this recording system requires that waste haulers complete manifest forms for every load 
of wastes delivered to the Authority.  The manifests ask for information such as:  origin of waste (by municipality); generator of waste (residential, industrial or commercial/institutional); type of material; and waste hauler license number.  The Authority enters this information in the computer system.

<P ALIGN=left>Vehicles are weighed on scales which record, via computer, the weight.  The Authority uses the tonnage and manifest records for computerized customer billing as well as tracking and accumulating data on weights, types and sources of all wastes delivered to Authority facilities. Keeping accurate records enables the Authority to plan and build appropriately sized and efficient solid waste facilities and to develop new waste reduction and recycling programs.

<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>

<P>1.	All users of LCSWMA Facilities shall pay the applicable fees at the time of, or prior to, use of the LCSWMA Facilities, unless LCSWMA has approved a charge account.  LCSWMA will approve a charge account only for (a) a governmental entity or (b) a Person who has demonstrated, to LCSWMA's satisfaction, acceptable credit.  Security for payment of the charge account (the "account security") may be required for any Person or governmental entity who has had a delinquent charge account within the preceding twelve months, who has violated LCSWMA's Rules and Regulations during the preceding twelve months, or who LCSWMA may consider to be a credit risk.

<P>2.	The account security shall be twice the highest monthly fee based upon LCSWMA's estimate of expected usage.

<P>3.	The account security shall be either a cash deposit or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank which maintains a place of business in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  The letter of credit shall be in form and substance acceptable to LCSWMA.  Cash deposits will be deposited by LCSWMA in a demand account in a banking institution of LCSWMA's choice.  Any interest earned on such account shall be retained by LCSWMA as an administrative charge.  LCSWMA will, within sixty days after payment of the account balance and termination of the charge account, refund the balance of the account security.

<P>4.	All charges will be billed monthly or more frequently by LCSWMA.  Payment in full of the current charges shall be due on the thirtieth day after the statement date unless other terms have been agreed upon in advance by LCSWMA.

<P>5.	If statement charges (including penalty fees) are not paid on the thirtieth day after the statement date, finance charges will be assessed at the rate of 1.5% per month (annual rate of 18%) on all past due amounts, and LCSWMA may at its option do any or all of the following: (a) revoke charge account privileges; (b) revoke all licenses issued to the account holder; and (c) apply the account security on account of the unpaid account balance.  If charge account privileges are revoked, an account security will be required for reinstatement of charge account privileges.

<P>6.	LCSWMA may for any reason which LCSWMA deems appropriate revoke charge account privileges or adjust the amount of the required account security.

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->In the Calibrated Imaging Laboratory, researchers are studying basic problems in all aspects of computer vision, and developing methodology and tools for camera calibration. The Calibrated Imaging Lab (CIL) provides flexibility in the configuration of lights and cameras so that data can be provided for many different studies, precision imaging equipment to limit noise and distortion levels, and scene measurement by independent instruments so that the image data and interpretations can be compared with the actual geometric and radiometric configuration of the scene.<p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR0">Facilities of the CIL</A></H2>
Lighting: Special color-controlled diffuse light fixtures and a theater lighting system provide flexible arrangement of lighting, and black curtains and ceiling limit the effects of background reflection. The CIL also has small-filament lamps to acts as &quot;point&quot; light sources, and a radiometrically controlled illuminator to provide light of a known spectral distribution.<p>
Imaging: Several monochrome and color CCD cameras are available in the CIL. Among these is a Photometrics &quot;scientific&quot; cooled CCD camera, with a sensor providing nearly distortion-free, noise-free 10-bit pixel values. For video cameras, the CIL has a computer-controlled filter wheel and a high-precision TV-grade lens with several thousand steps of resolution for focus, aperture, and zoom.<p>
Computing: The CIL has two SUN workstations, one for device control and the other with a 24-bit color display and digitizer. The CIL also has access to the VASC facilities, including many 24-bit displays, VAX mainframes, and iWARP and MASPAR supercomputers. Additional peripherals include a color scanner, and color and high-resolution black-and-white printers.<p>
Positioning: The CIL equipment is built around two optical tables. One is used for camera positioning, and has a high-precision six-DOF moving platform with cameras and other instruments mounted on it. The other optical table is used for positioning objects being viewed, and has a two-DOF moving platform. Both platforms are computer-controlled.<p>
Scene Measurement: Much research in image understanding does not include any attempt to corroborate the resulting interpretations with measurements of the scene. In the CIL, surveyors' theodolites are used to measure points in the scene to nearest-pixel accuracy, and a spectroradiometer is used for spectral measurements of light, cameras, and objects. A laser is used to measure the optical axis of cameras.<p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR1">Current research projects in the CIL</A></H2>
Image Segmentation Using Optical Properties: The CIL has been a world leader in the study of color, gloss, texture, and illumination, and how these factors can be used for computer vision. Current efforts are aimed at improving the measurement of surface orientation and surface roughness, and at building an integrated image segmentation system based on physical models of appearance.<p>
Image Sequences: Working in conjunction with the many mobile robot projects at the Robotics Institute, researchers in the CIL have developed improved algorithms for estimating vehicle motion and for producing shape descriptions from stereo and motion analysis. Currently, researchers are attempting to improve depth perception through stereo, motion, and defocus. Accomplishments include the new paraperspective model for factorization of image sequences, and the integration of stereo and focus using local spatial frequency.<p>
Camera Properties: The CIL is also developing new technology for describing and computing camera calibration properties for zoom lenses. Our new method of empirical measurement of zoom lens characteristics provides a practical way for vision researchers to harness the previously untapped power of computer-controlled zoom lenses.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->The Distributed Architecture for Mobile Navigation (DAMN) is a behavior-based architecture similar in spirit to the Subsumption Architecture. In contrast to more traditional centralized AI planners that build a world model and plan an optimal path through it, a behavior-based architecture consists of specialized task-achieving modules that operate independently and are responsible for only a very narrow portion of vehicle control, thus avoiding the need for sensor fusion. A distributed architecture has several advantages over a centralized one, including greater reactivity, flexibility, and robustness. The figure below shows the organization of the DAMN system, in which individual behaviors such as road following and obstacle avoidance send steering or speed commands the command arbitration module which combines these inputs into a single steering direction and speed command. Within the framework of DAMN, behaviors provide the task-specific knowledge for controlling the vehicle. Each behavior runs completely independently and asynchronously, providing votes to its appropriate arbiter, each at its own rate and according to its own time constraints. The arbiter periodically combines all the latest commands from each behavior and issues a command to the vehicle controller.<p>
In order to allow multiple considerations to affect vehicle actions concurrently, DAMN uses a scheme where each behavior votes for or against each of a set of possible vehicle actions. An arbiter then performs command fusion to select the most appropriate action. For example, vehicle commands such as steering turn radius are discretized into a fixed set of possible alternatives, and each behavior then votes for or against each command option, with varying weights reflecting the relative priority of the behaviors. The arbiter then computes a weighted sum of the votes it has received from each behavior, and the command choice with the highest value is selected and issued to the vehicle controller. <p>
DAMN is designed so that various behaviors can be easily added or removed from the system, depending on the current task at hand. Behaviors that have been used include one that interfaces to the ALVINN road following system, to the GANESHA obstacle mapping system, to the STRIPE teleoperation system, and to various other navigation modules; details on each of the subsystems are available on other samplers, or in reprints available from the Robotics Institute.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Medical robotics spans the broad areas of science and engineering to realize intelligent machineries that can be applied to clinical practice. Robotic technologies can improve existing clinical procedures as well as provide innovative new approaches to current clinical problems. A new breed of computer-based devices presents medicine with robust, clinically practical tools that can do much to augment the physician's skill while reducing the expense of <p>
Several clinical areas stand to benefit from the application of robotics and computer technology. One example is the execution of surgical procedures. Surgical precision is of vital importance in many fields such as neurosurgery and orthopaedics. Robotic surgical systems can greatly increase the accuracy of these operations and have already been applied successfully in a few surgical systems<p>
There is also a clinical need to develop engineering models which permit pre-operative planning and simulation of surgical procedures prior to the operation actually being performed. The development of this predictive capacity will bring the promise of computer and robotic assisted surgery to fruition. Computer simulations might also be used to more effectively train the surgeon of the future. <p>
Real time and interactive imaging of complex biomedical systems has become another priority within medicine. One major challenge is to integrate the precise information currently found within CT and MRI into surgical practice. The display of registered medical images on a patient would provide important new surgical guidance.<p>
Furthermore, there is currently no cost effective method for delivering high quality care to areas which are geographically or socioeconomically isolated. Telemedicine could provide a practical system for the delivery of expert care to these remote areas, but the appropriate technology must be developed.<p>
Engineering and clinical outcome analyses will become crucial in evaluating the cost and benefits of new techniques. Health care currently consumes approximately 14% of the GNP. There has been an increased awareness that the nation needs to contain these costs, but also improve the quality and access within the health care system. <p>
The rapidly evolving discipline of medical robotics addresses all of the aforementioned issues, as well as a host of other topics. To insure the clinical success of efforts in these areas, it is crucial that developments are driven by technical expertise as well as by physician-defined clinical needs. The realization of these improvements in medicine will require uprecedented collaboration between physicians and the robotics research community. <p>
MRCAS Background and Goals<p>
The Center for Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (MRCAS) was formed to foster the application of robotic technologies within medicine. In addition to the ongoing work within the Robotics Institute, MRCAS draws upon additional personnel and resources from departments such as Civil Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Computer Science. MRCAS has three primary goals:<p>
   Raise the awareness and support for robotics and computer assisted techniques within medicine.<p>
 Promote collaboration between physicians and researchers within the Robotics Institute.<p>
 Perform application-oriented research aimed at current clinical needs within the medical system.<p>
Some of the technology already exists to address these clinical needs; however, the integration of the constitutive parts is lacking. MRCAS brings together the diverse areas of engineering, science, robotics and medicine that are necessary to address these problems.<p>
Direction for this new effort has been provided by Takeo Kanade, Ph.D., and Anthony M. DiGioia III, M.D. Dr. Kanade is currently the director of the Robotics Institute and the U.A. &amp; Helen Whitaker Professor of Computer Science and Robotics. Dr. DiGioia is a practicing orthopaedic surgeon and an adjunct faculty member in the Dept. of Civil Engineering and the Robotics Institute. He also serves as the director of Shadyside Hospital's Center for Orthopaedic Research (COR).<p>
To help raise the awareness of medical robotics, MRCAS and Shadyside Hospital are hosting the &quot;First International Symposium on Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery&quot; in the fall of 1994. This conference will promote the dissemination of information between top clinicians and scientists within this new field. The symposium demonstrates the Robotics Institute's commitment to this unique merger of medicine and technology, and positions Carnegie Mellon on the cutting edge of an important new discipline.<p>
The ultimate aim of all efforts within MRCAS is the improvement of patient health and current healthcare practice. This goal can be accomplished by identifying specific and appropriate clinical needs and addressing these problems in a cost effective manner through the use of appropriate technologies.<p>
MRCAS Research Activities<p>
Much of the current work has been completed through joint endeavors between the Robotics Institute and healthcare related facilities such as COR at Shadyside Hospital. Current research entails both the development of new technologies, as well as the integration of existing techniques into clinically relevant systems. There are several specific areas of general research interest within the medical robotics program:<p>

<DL>
<DD>Robotic Surgical Systems<BR>

<DD>Medical Imaging<BR>

<DD>Teleoperative Surgical Systems <BR>

<DD><I>Minimally</I> <I>Invasive Surger</I>y <BR>

<DD>Orthopaedic Biomechanics<BR>

<DD>Preoperative Surgical Optimization and Planning<BR>
</DL>


The broad scope of this work demands expertise in such diverse topics as current clinical practice, controls, medical imaging, and structural mechanics. Projects are already underway in each of the areas of MRCAS research focus and it is anticipated that the research endeavors within the medical robotics program will yield unprecedented progress in these areas. <p>

<ADDRESS>Eric Krotkov</ADDRESS>
<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Perception research in the <B>Planetary Rov</B>er project (Ambler walking robot) focuses on techniques to robustly perceive rugged terrain. The approach is to use a laser rangefinder sensor to construct terrain representations for tasks such as locomotion and navigation. A key contribution of this research is a perception system that does not depend on the controlled conditions of industrial settings, but functions in unstructured, outdoor environments.<p>
<I>Sensing:</I> The primary sensor is a scanning laser rangefinder that directly measures range. A calibration procedure identifies the sensor position and orientation by observing the legs of the Ambler. Image preprocessing compensates for undesirable effects on the range measurements caused by temperature variations, ambient light, and material properties.<p>
<I>Map Construction:</I> Planetary rovers use terrain maps for many tasks. For locomotion, the Ambler accesses elevation maps to select footfall locations and ensure collision-free leg and body trajectories. <p>
We have developed an algorithm to build elevation maps from range images, accounting for the desired resolution and the current sensor orientation. It also identifies map regions that cannot be computed, and regions that are occluded by intervening terrain. The figure illustrates a terrain map of a sandy surface with a meter-tall boulder, and a ramp.<p>

<B>Elevation map (4mx5m)</B><p>
<I>Map Mosaics:</I> Merging elevation maps from successive viewpoints allows the construction of a composite map. A two-stage algorithm has been developed to determine the correspondence between elevation maps constructed locally or from an overhead orbiter. The figure illustrates a map mosaic created by merging 125 range images acquired at an outdoor site (the grid is 40x20x0.1 m).<p>
<A HREF="PR.TerrainMapping.figure.id.2.gif"><img src="PR.TerrainMapping.figure.id.2.gif"></A><p>
<B>Map mosaic form 125 rangs image</B><p>
<I>Long-Duration Operation:</I> Typical scenarios for planetary missions involve traversing and partially mapping hundreds of kilometers. This requires the perception system to process massive amounts of data, and places a premium on efficient management of computing resources. The design of the mapping system minimizes the amount of data stored while maximizing the speed of map computation. Further, the mapping system monitors performance and resource usage statistics in order to quantify the computing requirements for a planetary mission.<p>
<I>Current Work: </I>Research in progress seeks to develop two new capabilities: automatic map correction, and mapping terrain compliance. The approach for updating and correcting maps is to use position feedback from the Ambler legs to periodically refine the calibration parameters of the rangefinder. The method for mapping terrain compliance is to analyze the force/displacement profiles of each step, recording the results in a &quot;material&quot; map.<p>

<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Robots on the international Space Station Freedom have the potential to assis astronauts during extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and to replace astronauts in performing simple, dangerous or routine tasks. Particular tasks include transport of small parts, holding tools or light sources, and carrying cameras or other sensors for inspection. To demonstrate the pertinent technologies, we are developing a robot--the Self Mobile Space Manipulator or SM<em sup>2</em>--for locomotion and basic manipulation on the proposed station. SM<em sup>2</em> comprises two slender links connected by a rotary joint, with three-DOF wrist joints and grippers at each end. The current embodiment of SM<em sup>2</em> is designed to walk on the recent I-beam-truss design of the space station: grippers at each end grasp the flanges of the truss beams, enabling SM<em sup>2</em> to walk by alternate shifting of its base of support from one foot to another. <p>
Robot Design: The robot is designed for mobility in a zero-gravity environment, with simplicity and low mass as primary design goals. The robot is assembled from seven, identical, compact, self-contained, modular joints. The connecting links are lightweight, aluminum tubes, and give SM<em sup>2</em> a reach of about 80 inches. Each truss gripper has two fixed fingers and a sliding finger that closes to grasp the beam flanges, which vary from 4 inches to 6 inches wide. Each gripper incorporates a position sensor; contact switches on the fingers to verify grasp; and three proximity sensors, mounted at the bases of the fingers, to indicate proximity and proper alignment with the beams. SM<em sup>2</em> carries three video cameras at the elbow and each gripper, each with controllable focus, zoom and aperture. <p>
Gravity Compensation Systems: To simulate the zero-gravity environment at an orbiting space station, we have developed two gravity-compensation systems. Passive counterweights provide vertical balance forces for the robot through a system of cables and pulleys, and employ 10:1 weight ratios to minimize the effective inertia of the weights. For each system, an overhead mechanism actively controls horizontal motion to keep the support cable directly above the moving robot, based on a sensor designed to measure the deviations from vertical of the support cable. Cable routing is such as to decouple the horizontal and vertical motions. The first system is based on a gantry design, and provides X-Y motion over a 100-inch by 180-inch range, for global locomotion experiments. The second system is based on a swinging boom, and provides R-theta motion of two support points over an 80-inch by 180-degree area, allowing support of payloads as well as the robot.<p>
Robot Control: A long reach, flexible structure, and compliance in joints make accurate positioning difficult. We developed a multi-phase control scheme to employ different controllers for different operational conditions. We developed an adaptive control scheme for identification of the dynamic model in real-time based on neural-networks. Fuzzy control schemes model the friction and damping effects in the system and deal with redundancy in kinematics. We modeled teleoepreation skill and human performance using Hidden Markov Model. At the high level, a modular, hierarchical shared-control architecture coordinates teleoperation and autonomous motion in a systematic manner. The robot is able to walk on the truss and perform certain transporting/inspection tasks, using automatic control based on the truss model, or teleoepration control.<p>
Sensing and Teleoperation: A neural-network learning scheme, based on video images from the tip and elbow cameras, allows the robot to accurately approach the truss beams. Proximity sensors on each gripper are used for correcting misalignment of the gripper to the truss for a reliable grasping. We developed a real-time graphic interface for display and control of robot motion at the control station, which includes a 6-DOF free-floating hand controller. An operator provides control commands through the graphic interface or/and hand controller, based on camera views from tip and elbow cameras. Camera views may also be used for automatic control of robot motions. We have also been working on voice control interface and auditory display of force sensing to enhance telerobotic capability of the system. <p>

It can also confound certain algorithms, like stereo, if it is not recognized and explicitly accounted for. Until now, there has been no reliable means of detecting and exploiting regions of texture in images of realistic scenes.<p>
<H4><A NAME="HDR0">Our Approach</A></H4>
We are addressing this problem using the space/frequency representation. This representation shows the local spatial frequency content of every point in the image. We compute it by computing the 2D Fourier power spectrum in a neighborhood around each pixel we choose to analyze. This is called the image spectrogram. It preserves the spatial coherence of the image that would otherwise be lost in a full power spectrum of the whole image. The spectrogram is similar to other space/frequency representations like the Wigner distribution, Gabor filters, and wavelets.<p>
We have shown how the spectrogram of an image lets us easily analyze many disparate phenomena with the same representation. It is best-suited for phenomena that need to be described in terms of both spatial and frequency coordinates. Our early work demonstrated its usefulness for texture segmentation, shape-from-texture, and the analysis of aliasing, zoom, and blur. We have developed some of these initial ideas into an algorithm for segmenting and computing surface normals from multiple regions of image texture.<p>
<H4><A NAME="HDR1">Segmentation and Shape from Texture</A></H4>
Most current texture research is aimed at either segmenting regions of similar texture or computing surface normals from texture gradients (shape-from-texture). The segmentation research is based on the assumption that textures in an image are flat and viewed from the front. Shape-from-texture research is based on the assumption that there is only one texture in the scene, or that the similarly textured regions have been segmented. Based on these mutually exclusive assumptions, it is impossible to segment and compute surface normals from realistic images, because they violate both assumptions. Our goal is to outline the regions of similar texture in spite of the deformations caused by 3D perspective effects.<p>
We solved this problem using the image spectrogram. We begin by computing local surface normals based on shape-induced frequency shifts. As a textured surface recedes from the viewer, its frequencies appear higher. We have developed a mathematical relationship between the frequency shifts and the surface normal. For presegmented images, we can compute surface normals to within about four degrees. When we don't know the texture boundaries, we can still get a rough estimate of the local surface normal by comparing frequency shifts between nearby points in the image.<p>
In order to segment the textures, we merge image regions with similar texture. However, shape-induced frequency shifts can cause similar textures to appear quite different, and this often leads to a poor segmentation. We solve this problem by using the local surface normal estimates to undo the 3D perspective effects, giving &quot;frontalized&quot; versions of the textures' power spectra. For each pair of neighboring regions, we make a tentative assumption that they are both from the same planar surface with the same texture. If their frontalized power spectra are similar, they are merged into one region. This merging continues until the textures are segmented. We use a novel &quot;minimum description length&quot; criterion for evaluating potential merges. The result is a segmented image along with the surface normals of the textured regions. We know of no other algorithm than can segment 3D textured surfaces by explicitly accounting for 3D shape effects.<p>
<A HREF="Space_Frequency.frame.figure.id.1.gif"><img src="Space_Frequency.frame.figure.id.1.gif"></A><p>
<H4><A NAME="HDR2">Implications</A></H4>
The space/frequency representation has proven useful for solving the combined problem of segmentation and shape from texture. Other researchers here are using the same representation for stereo and depth-from-focus. We envision a gradual merging of image understanding algorithms based on the space/frequency representation - &quot;The Unified Theory of Spatial Vision.&quot;<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Obtaining depth information by actively controlling camera parameters is becoming more and more important in machine vision, because it is passive and monocular. Focus interpretation is a valuable alternative to stereo vision because it doesn't require solving correspondence for depth recovery.<p>
There are two distinct scenarios for using focus information for depth recovery: using focus and defocus information.<p>
<H4><A NAME="HDR0">Depth From Focus</A></H4>
We try to determine distance to one point by taking many images in better and better focus. This is also called ``autofocus'' or ``software focus&quot;.<p>
The key problems in depth from focus have been the choice of the focus criterion and efficient peak detection from the focus criterion profile. We used the Tenengrad operator to measure focus quality because of its monotonicity and relatively sharp peak. But due to noise and other imperfections, the focus criterion profile usually displays a number of small ripples which may cause the traditional Fibonacci search to be trapped in local extrema. Based upon the observation that the ripples are small in scale, we developed a two-step peak detection method with a coarse Fibonacci search and fine-tuning by fitting a curve to the <I>local</I> focus criterion profile to find the real peak. Surprisingly, such a simple technique yields a great improvement of the performance, i.e. the precision of depth estimation from focus can be as high as 1/1000 when the target is 1.2m from the camera. Before our work, the best previously reported result was 1/200 at about 1m distance.<p>
<H4><A NAME="HDR1">Depth From Defocus</A></H4>
By taking a small number of images under different lens parameters, we can determine depth at all points in the scene. This is a possible range image sensor, competing with laser range scanner or stereo vision. Best reported result is 1.3% RMS error in terms of distance from the camera when the target is about 0.9 m away.<p>
The depth from defocus method uses the direct relationships among the depth, camera parameters and the amount of blurring in images to derive the depth from parameters which can be directly measured. The key problems are the measurement of difference of blurring amount and the calibration of the mapping between depth and the difference of blurring. <p>
To preserve locality, we have to employ the windowed Fourier transform. But due to the spectral blurring introduced by the window, direct utilization of the Fourier magnitude information tends to have large errors. The maximal resemblance estimation eliminates the window effect by iteratively convolving the less blurred image with an artificial point spread function, whose spatial constant is the difference of blurring computed previously. Combined with proper thresholding of magnitude information to suppress the noise effect, the maximal resemblance estimation can quickly converge to very accurate estimations of blurring difference.<p>
Combining this new method with an blurring model based on lens motor coordinates, we have demonstrated depth estimation precision from defocus at 1/200 precision when the target is 2.5m from the camera. The best previously reported result was about 1/77 at a distance of 0.9m.<p>
<H4><A NAME="HDR2">Further Work</A></H4>
We are now working to blend information from defocus and stereo vision in a single system, to take maximum advantage of the complementary information provided by each. The key observation is that defocus computation is based on a difference of Fourier magnitude, while stereo disparity is based on Fourier phase, so that the two can be combined in a single framework. We are developing a new method for 3D model acquisition using this technique, so that the camera position (i.e. stereo) and lens parameters (i.e. focus) can be jointly optimized to get the most information from each new image.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->The ALVINN-on-a-chip project is developing an intelligent VLSI imaging sensor for road following. This sensor generates heading information required to steer a robotic vehicle by &quot;watching&quot; the road. The processing performed on chip is ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network), a neural network trained to drive without human intervention on public highways. Circuitry for neural computations is integrated with a photosensor array using VLSI in order to directly sense road-image information.<p>
Image-based control of a vehicle at high speeds is a demanding real-time task. While an image sensor generates vast amounts of data, only a small fraction of the information is relevant. Human drivers use their experience to extract needed information from what they see. The ALVINN neural network provides a similar capability, extracting information required to stay on the road from converted intensity images. Through a training process, the network learns to filter out image details not relevant to driving. However, current implementations of ALVINN rely on conventional <I>sense-then-process</I> vision methods that must needlessly digitize, transfer and process full video frames.<p>
VLSI technology provides the opportunity to integrate the imaging and computation required by the ALVINN task. The resulting <I>computational sensor</I> intelligently extracts relevant information from raw image input at the point of sensing. The bottleneck between image input and computer, present in traditional system implementations, is eliminated. Local processing of image information reduces system latency while increasing data throughput --- meeting the fundamental requirements of real-time robotic-vision tasks. In addition, computational sensors are compact, rugged and cost-effective because they are implemented on a monolithic silicon substrate.<p>
Prior to ALVINN-on-a-chip, significant bandwidth and computation were wasted transferring and processing image data from video cameras. As a result, system throughput was limited to only 10 frames/second. Much higher frame rates are required to obtain further gains in the speed and performance of the driving task. Latency is another serious problem alleviated by a VLSI implementation. Applications, like ALVINN, are sensitive to the real-time nature of the images, and excessive latency limits system stability. When video cameras and frame stores are used, the image data available to update vehicle heading is that taken by the camera several frames back. While pipelining can improve system throughput, the latency in an imaging system built around a frame store cannot be eliminated. <p>
VLSI integration of the ALVINN system provides a practical, yet challenging, application which combines and builds on our expertise in computational sensors, real-time connectionist image processing and autonomous mobile systems. An intelligent, rapidly programmable sensor for neural-network based imaging that is fast, cost-effective, and compact will be the result. Our strategy is to simultaneously advance the technology of neural-network based imaging as we further investigate the potential of VLSI-based computational sensors.<p>

<TITLE>Chimera Real-Time Operating System</TITLE>
<H1>Chimera Real-Time Operating System</H1>
<ADDRESS>Investigators: David B. Stewart and Pradeep K. Khosla</ADDRESS>
<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->The <B>Advanced Manipulators Laboratory</B>, at Carnegie Mellon University, has developed the Chimera Real-Time Operating System, a next generation multiprocessor real-time operating system (RTOS) designed especially to support the development of dynamically reconfigurable software for robotic and automation systems. Chimera is already being used by several institutions outside of Carnegie Mellon, including university, government, and industrial research labs.<p>
Chimera is a local operating system, designed to work with SunOS as the global operating system. Chimera not only provides all the standard RTOS features, as found in commercial RTOS such as VxWorks, OS-9, VRTX, and LynxOS, but also has many features and tools which are useful for quickly developing reconfigurable and reusable code.<p>
<I>Hardware</I>: Chimera is a VMEbus-based operating system which supports multiple general and special purpose processors. General purpose processors come in the form of single-board-computers (currently MC680x0 family of processors is supported) which we call Real-Time Processing Units (RTPUs). The kernel automatically configures itself to use the built-in devices of the RTPU for providing these services, allowing the same binary executable to run on several different models of MC680x0-based RTPUs.<p>
<I>Real-time kernel</I>: Chimera has a full-featured high performance multitasking real-time kernel which provides task and memory management, flexible scheduling supporting static, dynamic, mixed, and user-definable algorithms, user-space system calls to reduce operating system overhead, virtual timers, and a variety of communication and synchronization mechanisms. For quick development of interrupt-driven applications, a C-language interface to local, VMEbus, and mailbox interrupts is also provided.<p>
<I>Multiprocessors</I>: Chimera is a true multiprocessor RTOS, with the support built into the kernel. This is unlike most commercial RTOS which are single processor operating systems that are replicated on multiple CPUs and communicate with each other using some form of network protocol or operating system extensions. The kernels communicate with each other with a real-time, low-overhead, non-blocking message passing mechanism which we call <I>express mail</I>. This underlying system communication provides the basis for many different user-level multiprocessor communication and synchronization mechanisms, including dynamically allocatable global shared memory, remote semaphores, prioritized message passing, global state variable tables, multiprocessor subsystem task control, remote procedure calls, host workstation integration, remote symbolic debugging, triple-buffer external subsystem communication, and the extended file system.<p>
<I>Error detection and handling: </I>Chimera has elaborate error detection and handling facilities. Its most prominent features are the global error handling and deadline failure handling mechanisms. With the global error handling, errors in system or user modules generate an error signal, which in turn invoke an error handler. It completely removes the need to check error return values, such as <I>&quot;if (read(...) == --1) then perror(...)&quot;</I>. A default error handler is provided to print out an error message and abort the task. The default handler can be overridden by any number of user-defined handlers. Processor exceptions also generate error signals, allowing both processor exceptions and software errors to be handled with a single mechanism. The deadline failure handling operates in a similar manner, except that it detects timing errors, such as missed deadlines.<p>
<I>Libraries: </I>Chimera has an extensive set of utility libraries, including the standard UNIX libraries, such as strings, math, random, and time; a concurrent standard I/O with built-in multitasking synchronization; a matrix math package; and a command interpreter library for quickly developing custom command-line interfaces.<p>
<I>Reconfigurable Software</I>: Chimera provides many tools for quickly developing dynamically reconfigurable sensor-based control systems, such as the multiprocessor subsystem task control mechanism, the global state variable table, reconfigurable device drivers, generic sensor/actuator and special purpose processor interfaces, and a configuration file reading utility. The operating system automatically integrates the reconfigurable modules by creating and initializing tasks on the appropriate RTPUs, setting up inter-module communication paths, handling their timing and synchronization, catching and directing signals which control flow of an application, and providing on-line information such as state, criticality, measured versus desired frequency, errors detected, execution time, and CPU utilization for each task in a subsystem.<p>
<I>User Interfaces: </I>In addition to its default command-line interface and support for C and C++ programming languages, Chimera provides a network interface allowing it to communicate with Onika, which allows programmers to develop, debug, and execute reconfigurable real-time applications graphically.<p>

<H1>Shape and Motion from Image Streams</H1>
<ADDRESS>Takeo Kanade and Conrad Poelman</ADDRESS>
<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Sensing the shapes of objects and their motion relative to a camera is of great importance in a wide range of applications, such as autonomous navigation, robotic manipulation, and cartography. When an observer moves about an object, shape information is revealed through changes in the appearance of the object. We are developing a method for automatically recovering both the shape of an object and the camera motion from a sequence of images.<p>
In principle, the stream of images produced by moving a camera about a rigid object provides enough information to fully recover both shape and motion. However, existing techniques based on stereo triangulation are ill-conditioned when the scene is relatively distant from the camera.<p>
We have developed a factorization method to robustly decompose an image stream into object shape and camera motion. The method begins by identifying prominent feature points and tracking them from each image to the next. The positions of those points in each image are then entered into a large measurement matrix, which is factorized into shape and motion using singular value decomposition (SVD). The factorization method is able to reduce the effects of noise because it applies a well-conditioned numerical computation to data that is in fact highly redundant. It makes no assumptions about smoothness or regularity of motion. The process is diagrammed in Figure 1.<p>
The first factorization method was based on an orthographic model of image projection. This model did not account for the scaling effect in an image of an object as it moves towards or away from the camera, nor for the apparent rotation of an object which is not centered in the image. Because of the limitations of the model, the method was also unable to determine the distance to the object.<p>
We have recently developed a paraperspective factorization method based on a more realistic projection model. The paraperspective projection model accounts for both the scaling effect and the apparent rotation effect. In addition, this new method is able to recover the distance to the object in each image frame. We subsequently extended the method to accommodate longer image sequences in which, due to larger motion of the camera, many of the features are not visible throughout the entire sequence.<p>
Figure 2 shows the first and last images of a long video sequence, taken from a small airplane using a hand-held video camera, of a suburban Pittsburgh residential area adjacent to a steep, snowy valley. Despite the rough, non-uniform nature of the flight and significant noise in the images, the paraperspective factorization method successfully recovered the topography of the terrain, as demonstrated by Figure 3. These and other experiments have shown that the method is a practical technique for sensing the shapes of objects and the motion of the observer in a variety of applications. It could be used to automatically create three-dimensional models of objects for use in virtual reality systems, to use a single camera to determine the motion of an autonomous vehicle and map its environment, or to build site models of areas to undergo construction or structures to be remodelled from a videotape of the site.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->The perception of material properties is a field in its early infancy. Although young, the field is important, because the new capability to perceive material properties will expand robotic horizons by enabling robots to perform tasks that are currently infeasible. Such tasks include robotic grasping of slippery objects, handling hazardous waste, recycling garbage, robotic excavation, non-destructive evaluation, and mobility in natural terrain.<p>
In preliminary work, we have begun to define the field by developing the robotic capability to distinguish a wide variety of materials. We disambiguate different materials by actively contacting and probing them, and by sensing the resulting forces, displacements, and sounds. Here, we report on three of our preliminary investigations: step and feel, hit and listen, whack and watch.<p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR0">Step and Feel</A></H2>
The objective was to identify the compliance of natural terrain. In this work, a robot leg (instrumented with a six-axis force-torque sensor) stepped on different terrains: sand, sawdust, and soil. We measured the applied normal force <I>f</I> and the vertical displacement <I>z</I> while stepping on the materials <p>
The observed vertical force-displacement response differed dramatically for the three materials tested, demonstrating that the samples can be discriminated without great difficulty.<p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR1">Hit and Listen</A></H2>
The objective was to classify objects from the sounds they made when struck. In this work, we hit a variety of objects by dropping a blind person's cane from fixed heights, and listened to the sounds of impact with a microphone. The objects included a wooden block, a concrete brick, a clay brick, a zinc ingot, and a ceramic tile.<p>
We digitized the microphone signal and extracted spike features from its power spectrum. Based on these features, we classified the test object as one of the five objects with a hybrid minimum-distance and decision-tree classifier. The classifier achieved 97 percent accuracy on 580 training samples, and 94 percent accuracy on 240 test samples.<p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR2">Whack and Watch</A></H2>
The objective was to estimate the mass and friction properties of an unknown object. In this work, we struck a variety of objects with a home-made wooden pendulum, and observed their trajectories with a camera. We used the pendulum because its dynamics were simple enough to permit advance calculation of the instantaneous force, eliminating the need for force sensing. <p>
We acquired a sequence of images (see figure) of the pendulum making contact and of the object sliding. For each image, we employed basic blob-finding techniques to determine the position of the struck object. From the sequence of positions we derived the velocity and acceleration of the object. <p>
<A HREF="epkMatl.figure.id.1.gif"><img src="epkMatl.figure.id.1.gif"></A><p>
From the expected forces and the estimated accelerations, we computed the mass of the object using Newton's second law, and computed the coefficient of sliding friction using the equation of motion under constant acceleration. The computed masses were within a factor of two of the true masses, and the coefficients of friction were within 25 percent of the true values.<p>

<H1>STRIPE: Remote Driving with Image Transmission Delays</H1>
<ADDRESS>Jennifer Kay, Charles Thorpe</ADDRESS>
<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Supervised TeleRobotics using Incremental Polyhedral-Earth geometry (STRIPE) is a system for vehicle teleoperation across low bandwidth links and links with transmission delays. <p>
Driving a vehicle, either directly or remotely, is an inherently visual task. When heavy fog limits visibility, safe drivers reduce their car's speed to a slow crawl, even along very familiar roads. In teleoperation systems, an operator's view is limited to data provided by one or more cameras mounted on the remote vehicle. Traditional vehicle teleoperation systems require real-time transmission of a continuous stream of images from the vehicle to the operator workstation. The operator views the scene on one or more monitors, and controls the vehicle from a car-like console. The bandwidth necessary to transmit the images to the operator workstation is very large, about 5MB of data per second for high resolution monochrome images.<p>
Image transmission can be delayed for a variety of reasons such as large distances between the base station and the vehicle (e.g. the vehicle is on Mars) and low bandwidth transmission links (e.g. non-line-of-sight radio links). As the delay between images increases, an operator's ability to accurately teleoperate a vehicle in the traditional manner rapidly decreases. If there are several seconds between images, the visual feedback that the operator needs to steer accurately is simply not available. <p>
In STRIPE the low-level steering details are left to the vehicle. The operator indicates the high level directions (e.g. &quot;go up the road and turn right&quot;) by using a mouse to pick a series of points in the image (known as &quot;waypoints&quot;), which indicate the desired path. The vehicle moves along the designated path while the operator waits for the next image to arrive. <p>
In order to compute the appropriate steering direction, the STRIPE module on the vehicle must convert the 2D path in the image into a 3D path in the real world. Simple flat-earth techniques, in which all of the world points are constrained to lie on a single plane, are not sufficient to enable the vehicle to steer itself correctly when the path to be traversed is non-planar. In STRIPE, the 2D waypoints are transmitted to the vehicle, and are initially projected onto the vehicle's current groundplane. The resulting 3D waypoints are used to initiate steering of the vehicle, and  it begins to move. Several times a second, the vehicle re-estimates the location of its current groundplane by measuring vehicle position and orientation. The original image waypoints are then projected onto the new groundplane to produce new 3D waypoints, and the steering direction is adjusted appropriately. This reproject-and-drive procedure is repeated until the last waypoint is reached, or new waypoints are received.<p>
STRIPE has no advance knowledge of the 3D locations of all of the waypoints. However, as the vehicle approaches a particular waypoint, the vehicle's groundplane becomes an increasingly accurate approximation for the plane that the waypoint lies on. By the time the vehicle needs to steer based on that particular waypoint, it has a precise knowledge of where that point lies in the 3D world.<p>

<H1><A NAME="HDT0">Task-Oriented Vision Laboratory</A></H1>
The <B>Task-Oriented Vision Laboratory</B> is investigating the theory of how the requirements for accomplishing a visual task determine the optimal architecture of a vision system: representations, selection of modules and control schemata. Traditionally, computer vision research has emphasized investigating each vision module in a general and isolated condition. Such research efforts often generate unrealistic solutions from ill-defined assumptions. In contrast, we consider a vision system as a whole and emphasize the research on interactions<I> among</I> modules as well as the research on each vision module.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Framework for Task-Oriented Vision<BR>
</B>We are developing the framework for the task-oriented vision. The new framework introduces the notion of a &quot;task&quot; within which a vision module works. We investigate how a task constrains: 1) the choice of representation, 2) the vision modules to be used to extract such representations, and 3) the image acquisition methods for such modules<BR>
<B><BR>
Vision Algorithm Compiler (VAC)<BR>
</B>Currently, the majority of vision programs are generated by hand-coding methods. Programmers first carefully consider vision tasks, and then convert their knowledge into vision programs that will accomplish these tasks. Although the completed programs are efficient and effective, such methods are extremely time consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, we are developing techniques for the VACs which convert object and sensor models into vision programs automatically. In place of human programmers, a VAC examines both available object features (using object and sensor models) and available vision modules for low-level processing, then chooses the optimal set of features and vision modules to generate the optimal vision program for a given task. Current research topics include VACs for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and a Parallel Vision Algorithm Compiler (PVAC) for iWarp parallel computers.<BR>
<B><BR>
Assembly Plan from Observation <BR>
</B>Currently, the robot programming is done either by manual programming or by the &quot;teach-by-showing&quot; method using a teach pendant. Both methods have been found to have several drawbacks. We have been developing a novel method to program a robot, the assembly-plan-from-observation (APO) method. The APO system observes a human performing an assembly task, understands it, and generates a robot program to achieve that same assembly task. Current research topics include how to: choose meaningful snapshots from an image sequence; infer what kind of operation is performed from given snapshots; determine where and from which direction a gripper should grasp an object to achieve a task; and determine a path to transfer an object while avoiding collision with other objects from observation.<BR>
<B><BR>
Physics-Based Inspection<BR>
</B>Surface inspection is a vision application area that has great industrial significance. Inspection of machined parts, solder joint surfaces, and plastic sheets are just a few examples of industrial tasks too laborious and time consuming for humans. We are developing basic theories for surface inspection as well as complete end-to-end inspection systems. Our theories are ready to be applied to real inspection systems based on rigorous physics and mathematical theories. Current research topic includes: basic surface reflectance mechanisms, temporal-color space representations that relate how illumination variances effect apparent surface colors, and sensing theories for determining the optimal illumination and camera configurations under a given inspection specification. We are also developing complete inspection systems based on the developed theories: photometric sampler for silicone wafer inspection; range-brightness fusion system for solder join inspection; and 4-photometric system for plastic sheet inspection.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Solid Models from Observation<BR>
</B>Solid modeling is a useful tool for: representing virtual environments for virtual reality systems; representing real environments for robot programming; and modeling real objects for object recognition. Currently, these solid models are constructed by human operators. Often applications provide real objects to be modeled. If we can generate solid models from given real objects, we can reduce the effort and cost of constructing solid models. We are developing techniques to construct solid models from observation of real objects. Research projects include: building a virtual Carnegie Mellon Wean Hall corridor using a movable range finder cart; building human busts from a sequence of images; and building appearance models for vision algorithm compiler.<p>

<H1>Fast VLSI Range-Image Sensor</H1>
<ADDRESS>Andrew Gruss, L. Richard Carley and Takeo Kanade</ADDRESS>
<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Range image information conveys a rich description of the physical world that makes it the leading sensing technology for robotic inspection, manipulation and control tasks. In a range image, each pixel represents the 3-D distance to a point in the imaged scene. Many techniques for the direct acquisition of range images have been developed and, of these, light-stripe triangulation methods have proven to be among the most robust and practical. However, conventional light-stripe sensors are very slow, typically producing one or two frames of range data per second. This makes them unsuitable for fast recognition, dynamic scene analysis, or real-time control applications.<p>
We have built a high-performance VLSI sensor which uses a &quot;cell-parallel&quot; light-stripe algorithm to increase range-image frame rates by two orders of magnitude. The chip consists of an array of photosensitive cells which independently determine when they see light from the stripe reflected back by objects in the scene. Working in parallel, the <A HREF = "lstripe_sampler.figure.id.2.gif"><img src="lstripe_sampler.figure.id.2.gif"></A> array of cells acquires a 1,024 pixel range image in a millisecond. The accuracy and repeatability of each pixel has been measured to be within 1.0 mm at 500 mm distances (0.2%). The range-image frame rate is limited solely by sensor photo-detector bandwidth and is, in sharp contrast to conventional light-stripe techniques, independent of range image spatial resolution.<p>
The integration of sensing and processing using VLSI technology is the key to the sensor's performance. The 3-D measurements are made in parallel at each pixel site by continuously analyzing the observed intensity. A small amount of local computation in each cell results in a tremendous reduction in data bandwidth.<p>
A second-generation range-sensor chip is now operational. The cells of this new design are 40% smaller and employ a &quot;true-peak&quot; detector to measure stripe timing, replacing the thresholding circuitry used in the first-generation design. True-peak detection is a more robust means of stripe detection. The second-generation sensor operates on a wide variety of objects, unaffected by indoor ambient lighting. In addition, scene reflectance data is acquired with range data as an artifact of the peak-detection process. The pixels of the reflectance image are perfectly aligned with corresponding range-image pixels. The reflectance images assist in device calibration and provide additional sensing capability to applications.<p>
Now that the basic range-imaging technology has been successfully demonstrated, we are exploring use of the VLSI range sensor in robotic applications. Potential applications include whole shape measurement of a vehicle or aircraft, the design and inspection of manufactured parts, robotic manipulator control, 3-D imaging of the human body for use in reconstructive surgery, control of surgical instruments during an operation, design of protective equipment and tailoring in the fashion industry.<p>
In the first application that used the prototype sensor, we demonstrated full 3-D pose estimation of arbitrarily shaped rigid objects at speeds up to 10 Hz. We will continue to work on moving this technology from the laboratory and ultimately deploy compact range systems for use in university, industrial and medical robotics research.<p>

<H1>3-D Vision for Autonomous Navigation</H1>
<ADDRESS>Investigator: Martial Hebert</ADDRESS>
<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->An outdoor mobile robot, such as the Navlab, needs not only information derived from appearance (e.g., road location in a color image, or terrain type), but also shape information. In some tasks, such as cross-country navigation, the three-dimensional geometry of the environment is the most important source of information. In order to build three-dimensional representations of the environment we use an imaging laser range finder. 3-D vision for mobile robots has two objectives: object detection, and terrain analysis. Obstacle detection allows the system to locally steer the vehicle on a safe path. Terrain analysis provides a more detailed description of the environment which can be used for cross-country navigation or for object recognition.<p>
 Objects are detected from a range image by extracting the surface patches that are facing the vehicle. Neighboring patches are grouped into three-dimensional objects. The objects detected over many frames as the vehicle navigates can be combined into an object map. The resulting map can be used for navigating through the same region. Matching objects between observations is not very expensive in our case because we have only a few objects to match in each frame and because we can assume that we have a reasonable estimate of the displacement between frames from INS or dead-reckoning so that the locations of the objects detected in one image can be easily predicted in the next image. The algorithm for building object maps includes provisions for removing spurious objects and for the optimal estimation of object locations.<p>
Object maps are not sufficient for detailed analysis. For greater accuracy we need to do more careful terrain analysis and to combine sequences of images corresponding to overlapping parts of the environment into an extended terrain map. The terrain analysis algorithm first attempts to find groups of points that belong to the same surface and then uses these groups as seeds for the region growing phase. Each group is expanded into a smooth connected surface patch. In addition, surface discontinuities are used to limit the region growing phase. This terrain representation is used in a cross-country navigation system for the Navlab.<p>
   As in the case of object descriptions, composite maps can be built from terrain descriptions. The basic problem is to match terrain features between successive images and to compute the transformation between features. In this case the features are the polygons that describe the terrain parameterized by their areas, the equation of the underlying surface, the center of the region, and the main directions of the region. If objects are detected they are also used in the matching. Finally, if the vehicle is traveling on a road, the edges of the road can also be used for the matching. As in the case of object matching, an initial estimate of the displacement between successive frames is used to predict the matching features. A search procedure is used to find the most consistent set of matches. Once a set of consistent matches is found, the transformation between frames is recomputed and the common features are merged. <p>
  Three-dimensional terrain maps provide the support for autonomous navigation. We are investigating more detailed descriptions of the environment built from range data. In particular, we are developing object representations built from range images that can be used in landmark recognition and object matching. <p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->The development of software for dynamically reconfigurable sensor-based control systems is a complicated and tedious process, requiring highly specialized skills in real-time systems programming. The total development time can be reduced by automatically integrating reusable software modules to create applications. The integration of these modules can be further simplified by the use of a high-level programming interface which can integrate modules developed at different sites. <p>
The <B>Advanced Manipulators Laboratory </B>has developed Onika, an iconically programmed human-machine interface, to interact with a real-time operating system in the context of a reconfigurable software framework to create reusable code. Onika presents appropriate work environments for both application engineers and end-users. <p>
For engineers, icons representing real-time software modules can be combined to form real-time jobs. These combinations resemble control-block diagrams, making programming intuitive to the engineer. Connections between modules are done automatically. Modules and jobs can be executed and completely controlled from within Onika with just a few mouse-clicks. A status window keeps the user informed of the state of the underlying real-time operating system, while another window displays the values of system variables. Jobs can be saved for later recall and modification, and can be iconified for use by higher-level end-users. Onika verifies that all jobs are complete and syntactically correct.<p>
For the end-user, icons representing jobs and objects are assembled into full-length event-driven applications. The syntax of these icons is made apparent by the colors and shapes of their edges, which allow icons to interlock like jigsaw puzzle pieces. Onika verifies that each application is syntactically correct, non-ambiguous, and complete. It can then be executed from within Onika, or iconified and used in yet a higher-level application.<p>
In the event of any type of error, the real-time operating system signals Onika. Onika then informs the user as to the nature of the error, and allows the user to correct the error before continuing execution.<p>
Onika can retrieve and use software modules created at other sites, integrating them with other modules created locally. Aliases can be assigned to state variables, ensuring that modules which are created at one site will be executable at another site without modifications.<p>
Onika has been fully integrated with the Chimera real-time operating system in order to control several different robotic systems in the Advanced Manipulators Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University. Connection between Onika and Chimera is achieved via the Internet. Currently, Onika runs on the Sun4 and Sparc 10 platforms, and requires a color monitor for all functions to be enabled (monochrome monitors are sufficient for lower-level programming, however). Figure 1 displays a typical Onika session, showing both the upper-level and lower-level interface.<p>
<A HREF="onika_sampler.figure.id.1.gif"><img src="onika_sampler.figure.id.1.gif"></A><p>
Research issues associated with Onika include investigation of a grammar to describe iconic programs, creation of reusable and modular real-time software, support for non-native software packages, and reduction of costs associated with the creation of real-time software.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->The current development of applications for sensor-based robotic and automation (R&amp;A) systems is typically a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; process, where most software is developed from scratch, even though much of the code is similar to code written for other prior applications. The cost of these systems can be drastically reduced and the capability of these systems improved by providing a suitable framework that supports the development of reusable and rapidly reconfigurable real-time software for all R&amp;A systems. <p>
The <B>Advanced Manipulators Laboratory</B>, at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), has developed a novel software framework, based on the notion of dynamically reconfigurable real-time software. The framework provides for the systematic development and predictable execution of R&amp;A applications while maintaining the ability to reuse code from previous applications. The primary motivations for our approach include the following:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Reconfigurable hardware, such as open architecture computing environments (e.g. VMEbus) and reconfigurable machinery (e.g. Carnegie Mellon's Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator System) require reconfigurable software in order to take full advantage of the hardware capabilities.<BR>

<LI>Reconfigurable software is useful for supporting multiple applications on a fixed hardware setup.<BR>

<LI>Generic graphical user interfaces and programming environments for R&amp;A applications (such as Onika) require that the underlying system be reconfigurable.<BR>
</UL>


Other major advantages of designing applications to use reconfigurable software, even for systems which do not have to be reconfigurable, include the following:<p>

<UL>
<LI><I>Reusable Software: </I>Any software that is developed for a reconfigurable system is inherently reusable. <BR>

<LI><I>Expandability:</I> Existing hardware can be upgraded or new hardware or software added to the system without reprogramming the application.<BR>

<LI><I>Technology Transfer: </I>A module (and hence the technology implemented within that module) can easily be transferred to other institutions which are also using the framework.<BR>
</UL>


Modules are reconfigurable only<I> </I>if their design and implementation is <I>both</I> <I>independent of the target application</I> <I>and</I> <I>independent of the target hardware configuration</I>.<p>
The framework, shown in Figure 1, combines object-oriented design of real-time software with port-automaton design of digital control systems. A control module is an instance of a class of port-based objects. A task set is formed by integrating objects from a module library to form a configuration, which maps into a <I>job</I> at higher levels. State variables are used for the automatic integration of these objects. A subsystem is a collection of jobs which are executed sequentially, and can be programmed by a user. Multiple subsystems can execute in parallel, and operate either independently or cooperatively. <p>
Our framework defines classes of reconfigurable device driver objects for proving hardware independence of I/O devices, sensors, actuators, and special purpose processors. Hardware independent real-time communication mechanisms for inter-subsystem communication are also defined. <p>
Tools to support the implementation of this framework have been built into the Chimera Real-Time Operating System, which was also developed at CMU. Software for the control module, device driver, and subroutine libraries have already been implemented. As the libraries continue to grow, they form the basis of code that can be used by future R&amp;A applications. There will no longer be a need to develop new applications from scratch, since many required modules will already be available in these libraries.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->Autonomous manipulation in natural environments, in which few constraints exist on the geometry of the objects to be manipulated, is becoming increasingly important. Its potential applications include sample collection for planetary exploration and automated excavation.<p>
The challenge is to be able to deal with many completely different situations (terrain configuration, object shape, etc.) that are encountered in the course of the mission of a single robot. Furthermore, the robot should be as autonomous as possible to avoid some of the drawbacks of teleoperation. In particular, it should be able to build models of its environment that are relevant to the task without requiring extensive expert knowledge from an operator.<p>
We are studying the problem of perception and manipulation in natural environments in the context of the CMU Ambler, a six-legged machine for planetary exploration. In this case, the task is to collect samples such as small rocks on the surface of the terrain. The task involves extracting the potential samples from visual data, building models of their shapes, and using the models to pick up and store the sample.<p>
We are developing a set of perception modules for this task. All the perception modules currently use range images. The perception modules include: feature detection range shadow analysis based on sensor geometry segmentation by deformable contours (or &quot;snakes&quot;) representation by superquadric surfaces segmentation and representation by deformable surfaces (&quot;3-D snakes&quot;) matching and merging of data acquired from different viewpoints. Using those modules, we have built a system that manipulates natural objects (rocks) that are partially buried in soft material (sand) using a clam-shell gripper. Using the same approach, we are developing a system that manipulates natural objects of unknown shapes in a cluttered stack of objects. To test the system we use a testbed that includes a range finder, a robot arm, a gripper, and a terrain mockup.<p>
We are integrating the perception modules into a system in which perception and manipulation strtegies are selected from the analysis of a task defined by an operator. The task description includes the type of manipulation operation to be performed, the type of environment, and a region in the world in which the system should operate as defined by an operator. Once the selected sequence of perception operations is executed, the object can be manipulated using the representation built by the perception system. The techniques developed on this sampling testbed will be used in other robotic systems that operate in natural environments. <p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->We are investigating a new approach for representing 3-D curved objects for recognition and modeling. Our approach starts by fitting a discrete mesh of points to the raw data. The fitting is based on the concept of deformable surfaces: Starting with a spherical shape, a mesh is iteratively deformed, subject to attractive forces from the data points, until it reaches the stable shape which is the best fit to the input set of points.<p>
Once a discrete set of points is fit to the surface, values such as discrete surface curvature can be computed at each of its nodes. Moreover, each node of the mesh can be mapped to a corresponding node of a reference spherical mesh with the same number of points and the same topology as the object mesh. By storing on the spherical mesh the values computed on the surface of the object, we have, in effect, created a spherical image of the object. We call this spherical image the Spherical Attribute Image (SAI).<p>
The SAI representation has an important invariance property that makes it suitable for a number of applications in the area of 3-D object recognition and modeling: Assuming that the mesh fit to the object satisfies certain regularity constraints, the SAIs of two instances of an object which differ by a rigid transformation are identical up to a rotation of the sphere. Consequently, the problem of bringing two 3-D objects into registration is replaced by the much simpler problem of bringing spherical images into correspondence. Moreover, because of the way the mapping between object mesh and SAI is established, SAIs can be used to represent arbitrary non-convex objects and partial views of objects. We are taking advantage of these properties in three main areas which we describe below.<p>
<B>Object Recognition:</B> Given a complete object model represented by its SAI and a partial SAI extracted from a view of a scene, we can compute the best transformation between model and observed object by registering the two spherical images. The registration of the SAIs yields a set of correspondences between nodes of the model mesh and nodes of the observed mesh and a measure of similarity measure between the two SAIs. The correspondences are used for computing the transformation between model and scene; the similarity measure is used for deciding whether the model corresponds to the observed scene. This object recognition algorithm can be applied to general curved objects.<p>
<B>Object Modeling:</B> The general problem of 3-D object modeling is to build a complete object surface model given a number of partial views of the object. This problem is usually solved under the constraint that the transformations between viewing positions are at least approximately known. Using the SAI representation eliminates this constraint. Specifically, after a different SAI is created for every view, the transformation between views is computed using the matching algorithm described above. The data from all the views can then be transformed into a single reference frame and aggregated into a single surface model of the object. This approach has the advantage that no prior knowledge of the transformations is required.<p>
<B>Data Fusion:</B> Although the previous discussion of the SAI representation was based on the idea of attaching curvature at every mesh node, any value computed at a node of the mesh could be stored at that node, for example, the color. In this case, matching two SAIs involves finding the rotation that yields the smallest distance between the spherical images of both color and curvature. This gives an opportunity to use geometric information and appearance information in the same framework. <p>

This project at the <B>Vision and Autonomous Systems Center</B> addresses the task of building elevation maps of the seafloor for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using sonar data. Sonar is the preferred sensing modality for AUVs because it is less susceptible to attenuation and refraction by the water column than common terrestrial perception sensors like cameras and laser range finders. Sonar systems designed to directly generate 3D maps of their environment are generally complex or have low resolution, while systems that generate backscatter images of their environment are less complicated and more common. Hence, techniques that generate 3D elevation maps from 2D sonar backscatter images are necessary for terrain modeling and navigation underwater.<p>
We use backscatter data collected by a side-scan sonar system at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This type of sonar returns the backscatter from the observed surface as a function of range from the sensor for each ping of the sonar. If the sensor is towed in straight line then consecutive pings can be placed adjacent to each other to create a backscatter image of the seafloor. We have developed two techniques for the generation of elevation maps of the seafloor from side-scan sonar backscatter images. These techniques employ a scattering model of the seafloor to establish a correspondence between the backscatter at a point and the surface normal at that point. The first technique uses a constraint between the surface normal and the position of the sensor to generate a partial differential equation which, when solved, generates the elevation map of the surface. The second technique uses an iterative relaxation method to generate the surface by minimizing the difference between the intensity data and the calculated surface intensity. This technique is similar to shape from shading methods used in computer vision. In both techniques sparse bathymetric data is used to generate an initial guess for the shape of the seafloor and an initial guess for the scattering model parameters. <p>
These techniques are designed to support different scattering models, so they can be applied to different underwater environments. This is in contrast with other approaches that are generally less flexible with respect to the scattering model used. In addition to the elevation map of the seafloor, the parameters of the scattering model (like albedo and surface roughness) at every point in the image are generated. These parameters describe material properties of the seafloor, so maps of scattering model parameters can be used to segment the seafloor according to material type.<p>
If the sensor is not towed in a straight line, distortions will occur in the backscatter image that degrade the reconstruction of the elevation map. To remove the effects of these distortions we are developing techniques for incorporating knowledge about the movement of the sensor platform into the surface reconstruction process. First the surface is reconstructed locally using the assumption that locally the sensor moves in a straight line. Then these local reconstructions are transformed to a global coordinate system using the known position of the sensor and the reconstruction is done globally on all of the data. To carry out this task, we employ a method for merging sonar data taken from different sensor positions which can also be used in map merging.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->In the Navlab project we are building competent robot vehicles. Since 1984 we have been building systems for autonomously driving in the unstructured outdoor environment. The Navlab I and Navlab II vehicles combine sensing, sensor interpretation, planning, control, and testbed vehicles to create integrated navigation systems. They drive autonomously as far as 21 miles at speeds up to 55 mph; travel over cross-country terrain for hour-long runs; perform suburban delivery missions; and even park themselves. Our work is a central part of the ARPA Unmanned Ground Vehicle program. Our research includes both individual modules, and a system architecture.<p>
ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Net) uses neural networks to learn visual servoing. It watches a person drive for five minutes, and can then take over driving. ALVINN has been trained to drive on dirt paths, single-lane country roads, city streets, and multi-lane highways. Extensions to ALVINN include MANIAC (Multiple Alvinn Networks In Autonomous Control), which allows the vehicle to move smoothly from one type of road to another.<p>
YARF (Yet Another Road Follower) tracks lane markings and other features in images for road following. YARF has specialized trackers for following white lines yellow lines, and other features. It uses a geometric model to position tracking windows and to detect intersections and lane changes.<p>
Our cross-country navigation systems start with 3-D perception data from our onboard scanning laser rangefinder, sonars, radar, and trinocular stereo vision system. We produce several levels of representation: rough locations of quickly-detected obstacles, locations and descriptions of landmarks and significant objects, or detailed elevation maps. Using those elevation maps, our planning and driving systems avoid obstacles, recognize landmarks, and cross moderate off-road terrain.<p>
Other perception-based systems have demonstrated autonomously finding a parking space and parallel parking; convoy following; computer-aided teleoperation; and position estimation.<p>
Our vehicles, the Navlab I and Navlab II, provide convenient testbeds for autonomous navigation, and for data collection on a movable outdoor platform. Features of the vehicles include:<p>
Computer-controlled steering and speed control, on a modified van (Navlab I) and HMMWV (Navlab II).<p>
Sensors, including color video, scanning laser rangefinders, FLIR, stereo video, sonars, radar, inertial navigation, and a stabilized sensor platform<p>
State-of-the art workstations, plus rack space and conditioned power for additional processors or electronics.<p>
Room for onboard researchers to ride along and observe the computer displays and vehicle performance.<p>
We combine vehicles, perception, planning, and maps into integrated navigation systems. Our Annotated Maps encode information about both the locations of objects, and the appropriate vehicle actions at critical points such as intersections. DARN (the Decentralized Architecture for Robot Navigation) treats the output of each module as a behavior, voting for directions to steer and speeds to travel. It drives the vehicle along roads, smoothly steers out of the way of obstacles, and can integrate map following or user waypoint navigation.<p>
Details on each of the subsystems are available on other samplers, or in reprints available from the Robotics Institute.<p>

<ADDRESS>Investigator: Dirk Langer, Julio Rosenblatt, Martial Hebert</ADDRESS>
<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->As part of the Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) project, we have developed an integrated obstacle avoidance system. This system can be used for on-road driving for avoiding discrete obstacles, or for off-road driving for avoiding untraversable regions of the terrain. For example, we have demonstrated the system by driving autonomously through unmapped natural terrain at continuous speeds on the order of 3m/s. The figure below shows an example of the route driven by the vehicle in a typical test environment. The path is a one kilometer loop in this particular example.<p>
<A HREF="xc.figure.id.1.gif"><img src="xc.figure.id.1.gif"></A><p>
This navigation system takes range data as input, processes it in order to find regions that cannot be safely driven over, and generates recommendations for steering the vehicle based on the distributions of these untraversable regions. The system is set up as a reactive system in that it outputs steering commands frequently instead of planning long trajectories ahead. We now briefly describe the three components of the system which are illustrated by the figures at the end of this sampler.<p>
<B>Range Data Processing:</B> The purpose of the range data processing component is to extract terrain regions which cannot be traversed by the vehicle. The criterion used for deciding on the traversability of a terrain region combines the elevation of the region and its slope relative to the current vehicle position. The processing starts by converting pixels from a range image to points in space with respect to the current vehicle position. These points are then transformed into a two-dimensional discrete grid. Parameters such as slope, and min and max elevation are updated at a cell of the grid every time a new data point is added to the grid. The traversability of a grid cell is evaluated whenever a large enough number of data points is accumulated in the cell. The output of this procedure is a set of obstacle cells. In this approach, every time a new range pixel is processed, the corresponding grid cell is updated. This allows for greater flexibility in the format of the input range data, for example, it allows for the use of a single-line scanner instead of an imaging scanner. Also, this approach is more efficient because the obstacle cells are reported as soon as they are found in the range data instead of after an entire image has been processed.<p>
<B>Local Map Management:</B> A local map of the obstacle cells is maintained as the vehicle travels. The local map is updated when new obstacle cells are reported by the range data processing component. The positions of the obstacle cells with respect to the vehicle are updated at regular intervals in order to take into account the motion of the vehicle. The update rate is typically 10Hz. The resolution of the local map is typically 40cm. This local map component is based on the Ganesha system also developed as part of the UGV project.<p>
<B>Arc Generation:</B> The locations of the obstacle cells in the local map are used for evaluating the admissibility of a finite set of arcs. Each arc is assigned a vote between -1 (the arc is completely blocked by at least one obstacle cell) and 1 (all clear). In order to generate a single steering command for the vehicle, the distribution of votes is then sent to an arbiter which combines it with input from other modules, for example modules that steer the vehicle toward pre-set goal points, . The arc evaluation is performed at regular intervals, typically every 100 ms. This reactive approach to arc generation was developed as part of the Distributed Architecture for Mobile Navigation (DAMN ) which is the software architecture used in the UGV system.<p>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->To navigate and operate in the real world autonomous systems need to use sensors to learn about the state of the world around them. One of the richest sensing modalities is vision. Conventionally machine vision systems use cameras and lenses to produce 2D images from the 3D scene. To both interpret the images from the camera and plan sensing strategy for the camera we need to have models of the relationship between image and scene geometry.<p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR0">Why Adjustable Lenses?</A></H2>
Automated zoom lenses are useful for two tasks:<p>
<B>Adaptation</B>: Matching the camera's sensing characteristics (e.g. radiometric sensitivity, spatial resolution or focussed distance) to the requirements of a given task.<p>
<B>Measurement</B>: Inferring properties of the scene by noting how the scene's image changes as the camera's parameters are varied (e.g. range from focus).<p>
Whether for adaptation or measurement, to effectively use adjustable lenses we need to have models of the camera's image formation process that are valid across ranges of lens settings. <p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR1">The Modelling and Calibration Problem</A></H2>
For fixed parameter lenses the image formation process is static and thus the terms in the camera model are constants. In variable parameter lenses the image formation process is a dynamic function of the lens control parameters, and thus the terms in the camera model must also be variable. The question is, How do the terms vary with the control parameters? This is a difficult question to answer for two reasons. First, the two traditional models of the image formation process, the pinhole camera and the thin-lens, are idealized high level abstractions of the real image formation process and thus the connection between the lens' physical configuration and the model terms is not direct. Second, the relationship between the lens' physical configuration and the control parameters is complex and typically unknown. Thus, we have no good theoretical basis for the relationships between the terms of our camera models and the lens control parameters. As illustrated in the plot of effective focal length versus focus and zoom motor, every model term is potentially a function of every lens control parameter. The actual relationships must be determined empirically.<p>
Unlike the calibration of fixed parameter lenses, the calibration of variable parameter lenses requires that measurements be made over ranges of hardware configurations for the lens. This raises several challenges. First, the dimensionality of the data is the same as the number of control parameters that are to be concurrently modeled. A second challenge is the potential difficulty in taking measurements across the wide range of imaging conditions (e.g. defocus and magnification changes) that can occur over the range of some control parameters. <p>
<H2><A NAME="HDR2">Dynamic Camera Models </A></H2>
We have developed new algorithms and techniques to build models for cameras with automated zoom lenses. The objective is camera models that &quot;hold calibration&quot; across continuous ranges of lens parameters. Our approach involves first calibrating a conventional static camera model at a number of lens settings spanning the lens' control space. We then model how the terms of the static camera model vary with lens setting by alternately fitting polynomials to individual model terms and reestimating the unfitted terms using the calibration data. The process is repeated until all of the static camera model's terms have been replaced with polynomial functions of the lens control parameters. The result is a predictive camera model that can interpolate between the original sampled lens settings to produce a set of values for the terms in the static camera model for any lens setting. We have used these techniques to produce dynamic camera models based on Tsai's static camera model for two different automated camera systems. The models operate across continuous ranges of focus and zoom with an average error of less than 0.14 pixels between the predicted and the measured positions of features in the image plane.<p>

The rationale for developing highly interactive instructional materials is given by experts in education and pedagogy, who agree that active involvement in the learning process enables students to learn more effectively and more successfully. The rationale for developing multimedia instructional materials is that these media better capture the real images and signals input to a computer vision system than do conventional media such as textbooks, blackboard, and viewgraphs. Further, an assortment of media stimulates the attention and interest of many students more than do the conventional media.<p>
In the current format, the student sees three principal windows (see figure).The instructor's &quot;talking head&quot; giving the lecture appears in the upper left panel; text and graphics appear in the center panel; and the contents of the lesson, with touch-sensitive areas and controls for navigating through the material, appear in the left center panel.<p>

<HR><H2>Table of Contents</H2>

<HR><!-- This file was created with the fm2html filter.The filter is copyright Norwegian Telecom Research and was programmed by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner.  -->The goal of our research in fractal terrain modeling is to build dense terrain maps that accurately represent natural surfaces. The problem is difficult in part because the familiar Euclidean geometry of regular shapes, such as surfaces of revolution, does not capture well the irregular and less structured shapes found in nature, such as a boulder field, or surf washing onto a beach.<p>
Our research addresses two aspects of the problem: (1) estimation of the fractal dimension of a given point set as a measure of its roughness; and (2) realistic reconstruction of a natural surface from sparse, irregularly spaced data.<p>
Estimation of Fractal Dimension<p>
We have developed an algorithm to estimate the fractal dimension of patterns that exhibit fractional Brownian motion. The algorithm fits a line to the data points from the pattern plotted on log-log axes (log scale versus log expected change in pattern), and uses the slope to identify the fractal dimension. <p>
We successfully demonstrated this algorithm on data acquired with a laser rangefinder viewing natural scenes. As an example, the panels below show the reflectance and range images taken of a scene including sand and rocks. The graph shows the data points taken from the region of interest (marked by a rectangle), plotted on log-log axes.<p>

</A><p>
Fractal Surface Reconstruction<p>
We have developed a new surface reconstruction method based on fractal geometry. In contrast to approaches to surface reconstruction that impose smoothness constraints, our approach to natural surface reconstruction imposes roughness constraints.  The method, which follows Szeliski's approach, estimates dense surfaces from sparse data located in any configuration while preserving roughness. <p>
The figure shows the results of reconstructing the sparse data using regularization with the thin-plate smoothness functional as the prior model. The resulting interpolated surface is too smooth, and appears unnatural and unrealistic.<p>

</A><p>
To produce a more realistic surface, instead of using the thin-plate model we employ a fractal prior model. We extend Szeliski's work by using a Gibbs Sampler temperature schedule based on the successive random addition method for synthesizing fractal patterns. The figure shows the results of reconstructing the surface. These results are not too smooth; they appear natural and realistic.<p>

It can also be used with other range sensors, such as microwave radar, laser or stereo. Each sensor measurement is tagged with the position of the vehicle in world coordinates. The position and orientation of each sensor on the vehicle is known and the sensor readings can now be used to build a local grid map of the immediate surrounding of the vehicle. The vehicle position is kept at a fixed point in the map. As the vehicle moves, objects in the map are moved from cell to cell relative to vehicle position. Once an object falls outside the map boundary it is discarded and the information is lost. Using just a local map has the advantage that error accumulation owing to dead reckoning is kept small, since only relative movements are considered. At present the area covered by the local map is 16.4 m x 70.2 m. Each grid cell has a resolution of 0.4 m along the x-axis, and a variable resolution of 0.4 m, 2 m or 4 m along the y-axis , depending upon distance from the vehicle.

<LI><I>Object Type </I>: This parameter is used to indicate if the object in that cell was seen at the current sensor reading, or if it was seen at a previous reading. If it was seen only at a previous reading, then the object type indicates that it must have moved to that particular cell due to vehicle motion only. The parameter is also used to denote objects detected by different types of sensors. <BR>

<LI><I>Position</I>: indicates the x-y position of the object with respect to vehicle position.<BR>

<LI><I>History</I>: This parameter counts the number of times an object was detected in a particular cell. <BR>

<LI><I>Radius Vector</I>: is precomputed for each cell and denotes the range of steering radii that would avoid a collision between the vehicle and an object in that cell.<BR>
</OL>


<UNKNOWN>The resolution of the grid is fairly coarse and hence the position parameter is kept to avoid gross error accumulation when objects are transformed in the map. Only one object is kept per grid cell. Thus measurement uncertainty is part of the grid cell representation and any object detected within an area covered by a particular cell is taken to belong to the same object. New objects detected by the sensors are added to the map after the positions of all previous objects in the map are updated. The map parameter <I>History</I> is used for filtering the data. <I>History</I> is an indication of the confidence that a particular cell is occupied by an object. Objects in the map in a sensor's field of view are deleted if the sensor does not detect them during a certain time period. This eventually eliminates spurious readings or objects that have moved away. </UNKNOWN><BR>
<UNKNOWN>A navigation function using the grid map, is the tracking of features in the environment, such as a wall or parked cars. This type of feature appears in the map as a string of objects. Using additional knowledge about the approximate position of the feature, it can be determined which set of objects in the map belong to the feature. A line is then fitted to these objects, using the method of least squares and applying a median based filter technique to remove outliers. Once the position and orientation of the feature is known in the map, steering commands are generated, using the pure pursuit algorithm, to drive the vehicle on a path parallel to and at a constant distance from the feature.</UNKNOWN><BR>
<UNKNOWN>To avoid obstacles, each occupied cell is examined. The <I>Radius Vectors</I> of all occupied cells are and'ed together to generate the list of safe steering directions. Vehicle speed is changed depending on the distance to the closest object.</UNKNOWN><BR>
<UNKNOWN>Tracking a row of parallel parked cars, Ganesha can detect a parking gap. For parking, the vehicle lines up with the car in front of the gap and then backs into the gap along a precomputed S-curve. At present the curb cannot be sensed and therefore the width of the parking gap is assumed to be the average width of a car.</UNKNOWN><BR>

<A NAME="resp1"><b>Question 1</b></A><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My 1994 Chrysler Concorde makes a ticking noise when the engine is
running. 
It goes away when I accelerate.  Should I be concerned about this?

<A NAME="resp2"><b>Question 2</b></A><br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I've had my 1989 Honda Accord in for repairs to fix a severe
vibration
problem, but it still isn't fixed. It begins to shake when I approach freeway
speeds,
but the vibration goes away when I decelerate.  What's wrong?

<p>
<A NAME="resp3"><b>Question 3</b></A>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Which car should we keep?  We'll be getting a new car soon and
getting rid of
one of our current cars--a 1986 Mustang LX with 83,000 miles, or a 1989 Ford
Escort GT with 106,000 miles.  We mostly drive on expressways around Miami.
The Mustang has been a good car, except for a small transmission leak that was
fixed with sealant.  The Escort has an electrical problem:  the headlights
flicker when the fog lights are on, and the radio display doesn't work
periodically.

<A NAME="inq1"><b>Response 1</b></A><br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ticking noise on this Chrysler Concorde is commonly caused by 
the fuel injector rail. While a noise caused by a fuel injector rail may be a 
nuisance, this fuel injector rail problem will not do damage to your car, 
or interfere with your ability to continue to drive the vehicle. It may be 
repaired at your next appointment for scheduled maintenance. 
<p>
Other causes of this type of noise would be symptomatic of low fluid levels 
such as engine oil, engine coolant or transmission fluid. Be sure to check these 
fluid levels, or have them checked. If all the fluid levels are OK, it's likely 
that your noise problem is the fuel injector rail. The parts associated with the 
fuel injector rail repair include:
<br>
<ul>
<li>4663929 Fuel rail assembly<br>
<li>4765016  Bracket<br>
<li>4473619  Intake plenum gasket<br>
<li>5277723  EGR tube gasket<br>
<li>4418903  Pressure regulator gasket
<br>
</ul>
If this is not the source of your problem, there are a number of other possible
causes.  Check all the fluid levels, or have them checked.  If all the fluid
levels are OK, listen carefully to narrow down the possible sources of the
noise.

<A NAME="inq2"><b>Response 2</b></A><br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For a severe vibration approaching freeway speeds that becomes worse
as you
step on the gas, the most likely cause is a small worn area in a roller groove
of one of the inner CV joints on a drive axle.  Imagine a device that transmits
straightline torque from the transmission through a coupling that sends the
power to the wheels and allows for the up-and-down motion of the suspension.
This joint at the transmission end has a cross that couples to the axle and a
roller for each of the crosses.  The inboard CV joint has three roller grooves,
which allow for the in-and-out motion of the shaft.  When one of these roller
grooves gets a small dimple in it, the dimple catches the roller as it passes
back and forth and momentarily tries to hold the axle straight. The more gas
you give, the more this dimple tries to hold the axle, causing the outer end of
the axle to shake violently and send the vibration through the suspension and
the entire car.
<br>
The solution is to check the CV joints for wear, and to replace one or both if
they are worn.

<A NAME="inq3"><b>Response 3</b></A>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(First, AUTOSHOP Online asked which engine was in the Mustang;  the
customer
responded:  5.0 liter.)
<p>
Keep the Mustang.  The transmission may need work in the future, but a Mustang
with a 5.0 liter, 302 engine and lower mileage will last longer and have a
better resale value when or if you decide to sell it.  The Escort with the 1.9
liter engine has had more problems with the Electronic Engine Control and many
more drivability problems than the 302 Mustang.  Repairs will also be less with
the Mustang for things like the transmission and the electronics.  Yes,  miles
per gallon are lower with the Mustang, but overall it is a longer-lasting and
more reliable car.

<hr width=300>
<p>
<p>
<A NAME="inq4"><b>Response 4</A></b>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The problem with your truck is a fairly common one, occurring most 
often in the spring, when the AC system is on with the heater in the "Defrost" 
position. This happens when the outside temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees
F.
<p>
The blinking "AC" light is governed by the climate control head, which monitors
how often the compressor clutch operates.  When it turns on and off in less
than 1.5 seconds ten times in a row, the climate control head disables the
compressor, to keep it from being damaged, and activates the blinking "AC"
light on the dashboard. It may be that the compressor was once low on Freon;
sometimes, even after Freon has been added, the climate control head will
continue to register a problem.
<p>
There are some things you can do to fix the problem.  First, disconnect the
battery for about a minute.  Then reconnect the battery and start the truck.
Select the AC function on the climate control panel and see if the compressor
starts to operate.  If the compressor cycles on and off very quickly and the
"AC" light comes on again, you'll need to have the system serviced by a
qualified AC technician.  But if the AC starts to work properly, it should run
fine.

<p>
After having my van at several different places and not getting it fixed, 
I finally got the information I needed from the AUTOSHOP team. Next time I 
will start there.
<p>
My van had an intermittent problem with the lights on the dash coming and going. 
They would all come on or go all out. Once in awhile they would work correctly. 
I sent the inquiry to the AUTOSHOP team, and I heard right back. 
<p>
The answer was that a wire under the dash that provided the ground connection 
for a bunch of stuff on the dash was loose. They also provided the exact location

of the connection. I took the answer and my van to my neighborhood shop and they 
were able to repair the problem in no time.

<p>
Problem Starting and Stalling
<p>
The initial diagnosis at a repair shop was that the vehicle needed a new 
engine control computer at a cost of $400.
<p>
The AUTOSHOP team told me that the stalling problem was really caused by the 
injector circuit.  Each time the injector fired it sent a faulty signal to 
the car's computer and the computer's response was to stop firing that 
injector. Replacing the injector solved the problem and the cost was 
less than half that of a computer.  
<p>
Getting a second opinion saved me time and money.

Anti-Lock Brakes</H1>
</center>If you don't already own a
car or truck equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), chances are you
will before long.  Industry analysts estimate half of all new cars and light
trucks will be ABS equipped by 1995.<P>

A potential lifesaver, ABS helps keep your car under control should you jam on
the brakes on a slick road or under emergency conditions.  The safety benefits
will be reduced, however, without proper preventive maintenance and care.
Neglecting ABS can also lead to expensive repairs down the road, according to
the brake experts at AlliedSignal.<P>

"Too many drivers, whether their cars have conventional brakes or ABS, make the
mistake of thinking that replacing brake shoes and pads is all there is to
proper maintenance,"  explains Tony Lux, ASE certified Answerman for
AlliedSignal's Bendix brakes.  "What they need to be more aware of is the
system needs regular -- and proper--  maintenance to prevent expensive damage
down the road."
<h3>
What ABS Does</h3>
According to Lux, in vehicles with ordinary brakes, simply standing on the
pedal under poor traction conditions is likely to cause one or more wheels to
lock up, probably resulting in a skid.  To avoid skids, expert drivers rapidly
"pump" the brake pedal (releasing and re-applying it) when they sense wheel
lockup.<P>

"ABS provides  a similar pumping action,"  Lux explains.  "It automatically
re-applies brake pressure under stopping conditions that make wheel lockup
likely."  But, he adds, ABS adds an advantage.  "Unlike someone letting go of
the brake pedal and stepping back on it, ABS can do it much faster, sensing
impending skids and directing its `modulated braking' to whichever wheel, or
wheels, would have locked otherwise."
<h3>
How ABS Works</h3>
Lux says most of the brake parts in a car equipped with ABS are similar to
those on cars without it.<P>

"Although there are many similarities, cars with ABS have several additional
parts," he explains.  "ABS brake systems have speed sensors that measure wheel
speed and relay this information to an onboard electronic control unit.  This
unit calculates vehicle speed and during a lockup, signals a hydraulic actuator
which in turn applies and releases the brakes as many as 10 times per
second."<P>

Lux says speed signals from the wheels are sent to a central ABS computer.  The
computer compares wheel deceleration rates to the programmed vehicle while the
car is braking.  If any of the wheels are slowing more rapidly than the others,
the computer can tell it's about to lock up.  If the computer determines that a
wheel is approaching lockup, it then sends a signal to the hydraulic valve
block for that wheel.<P>

"The hydraulic unit valve block contains a quantity of brake fluid under very
high pressure," Lux explains.  "it also has valves that can bleed off brake
line pressure to any wheel(s) that may be about to lock up, while the other
brakes keep working.  Once the danger of wheel lock up has passed, pressurized
brake fluid is again allowed to reach that brake, which resumes slowing the
car.  The process takes place very quickly and may be repeated several times
each second."
<h3>
Maintenance/Service Implications</h3>
Lux says most routine brake maintenance on ABS equipped cars and trucks
shouldn't cost much more than servicing ordinary brakes.<P>

"Anyone used to working on conventional disc and drum brakes can handle many
routine brake jobs on a car with ABS," he says.  "They require essentially the
same procedures for replacing brake pads and shoes, and for resurfacing rotors
and drums.<P>

"Too many drivers, whether their cars have conventional brakes or ABS, make the
mistake of thinking that replacing such `friction material' as brake pads and
shoes is all there is to brake maintenance," Lux adds.  "They need to be aware
that it isn't and that all brakes -- with or without ABS -- need regular
maintenance to prevent expensive damage.  Skimping on maintenance with ABS can
lead to even more extensive and expensive problems than with ordinary
brakes."<P>

AlliedSignal's car care expert explains that the hydraulic side of ANY car's
braking system needs preventive maintenance.  For example, regularly flushing
out a car's or truck's brake fluid and replacing it with fresh fluid goes a
long way toward preventing brake problems as the vehicle ages.<P>

"That's even more important for a car with ABS."  Lux adds.  "The ABS modulator
unit isn't just complicated and expensive, it will get damaged if the fluid in
it is either dirty or moisture-contaminated.  Since most brake fluid naturally
absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, the only way to fight this problem is to
regularly flush and replace the fluid every 2 years or 24,000 miles."<P>

Lux emphasizes that anyone planning to work on the brakes of an ABS equipped
vehicle <b>must</b> check service procedures before
starting.  Specifically, he recommends consulting the appropriate shop manual
for the vehicle, and taking whatever precautions it lists.<P>

"There are several types of anti-lock systems being offered on today's vehicles
and it's important to know and understand what type you have," explains Lux.
"The Bendix system, for example, has a modulator that contains brake fluid
under pressure and must be depressurized before any work can be done.  Other
systems such as the Kelsey-Hayes and Teves, operate under little or no pressure
but still require use of a manual specific to that vehicle."<P>

Since ABS systems are relatively new, Lux suggests making sure that your
mechanic is up-to-date on ABS service procedures.  Fortunately, the extra steps
needed to do certain ABS jobs are not complicated and don't cost much more than
other brake work, and the benefits of properly maintaining your ABS brakes are
worth the effort.<P>

Is Your Car...</H1>
</center>Does your car squeal with
pain when you apply the brakes?  This could be the sound of your "chirper", a
signaling device built into the system to warn you of worn brake pads.  A
squealing or grinding noise also is characteristic of the new, semi-metallic
friction material used on brake pads and linings.  This material replaces the
hazardous asbestos previously used.<P>

Brake performance on vehicles of recent years is significantly improved, as is
the service life of braking system parts.  Unfortunately consumer attitude
toward preventive maintenance has not kept pace with technology.  A national
consumer survey showed vehicle neglect is on the rise even though nearly half
of motorists ranked brake failure as their number one fear among driving
emergencies.<P>

Surprisingly, notes the Car Care Council, less than 20% identified brakes as a
system to be checked regularly.<P>

The U.  S. Government Accounting Office reports that states without vehicle
safety inspection programs had accident rates 17% higher than those with
inspection programs.<P>

Whether or not your vehicle's brakes are inspected periodically, as they should
be, be aware of the signs of brake trouble and take corrective measures at
once.<P>

Listen for unusual noises when brakes are applied.  To improve hearing, try
applying brakes at slow speeds with windows down.<P>

Note:  Brake work performed in time saves money as well as lives.  Some owners,
to squeeze extra miles out of their worn brake pads, have been known to disable
the "chirper" (mentioned earlier.)  This is a classic case of false economy,
warns the Council.  In addition to affecting driving safety, metal-to-metal
wear of rotors or drums adds hundreds of dollars to a brake system overhaul.<P>

If brake fluid needs topping off frequently, find and correct the leak.<P>

If brakes pull to one side, if they shudder or if the pedal pulsates, have a
qualified technician check out the trouble.<P>

If the pedal "fades", feels spongy or falls to the floor under steady foot
pressure, take the vehicle in for service.<P>

Invest in the best quality brake work you can obtain.  It's an excellent form
of insurance.<P>

for the Council's free pamphlet, "HOW TO KEEP YOUR BRAKES FROM LETTING YOU
DOWN."  Their address is Car Care Council, Department B, One Grande Lake Drive,
Port Clinton, OH 43452.&nbsp;<P>

<h1>Expert Advice On Finding A Good Mechanic</h1>
</center>
Truck or van is the second costliest purchase you will ever make -- out ranked
only by your home.  And it's also likely that you're discouraged by the thought
of maintaining your vehicle.  Today's vehicles seem too complex for your own
backyard tinkering, and finding a good repair facility with competent mechanics
seems more difficult than it should be.  <P>

Fortunately there's a group that can help take much of the guesswork out of
finding a competent mechanic.  The independent, nonprofit National Institute
for Automotive Service Excellence, better known as ASE, is dedicated to
improving automotive service and repair by testing and certifying the
competence of individual mechanics, or "technicians," to use today's
terminology.<P>

ASE is the only automotive certification group that is both national in scope
and industry-wide.  It is self-supporting, with a forty-member, volunteer board
of directors drawn from all segments of the automotive service industry, as
well as representatives from education, government and consumer groups.
<h3>
ASE means Good News for Consumers</h3>
ASE-certified technicians have &lt;i&gt;<i>proven</i>  &lt;/i&gt;their
competency to you, to their employers, and to themselves by passing national,
standardized exams.<P>

Because ASE's program is voluntary, technicians who have paid in time and money
to earn ASE certification can be counted on to have a strong sense of pride in
their profession.  Moreover, prior to taking ASE exams, many mechanics attend
training classes or study after work to increase their knowledge, another plus
for consumers.<P>

ASE certifies only the individual technician, not the repair shop itself, but
it stands to reason that employers and managers who encourage their technicians
to earn ASE's national credentials will be concerned about all aspects of their
business.
<h3>
The Nuts and Bolts of ASE Certification</h3>
Twice a year some 100,000 technicians sit for ASE certification exams at over
600 locations.  The exams are administered in the field by ACT, the same
organization that offers college entrance and other professional exams. <P>

The exams, which stress real-world diagnostic and repair problems, are designed
by representatives from the automotive service and repair industry, vocational
educators, and ASE's own in-house technical specialists.<P>

There are eight automobile exams:  Engine Repair, Engine Performance,
Electrical/Electronic Systems, Brakes, Heating and Air Conditioning, Suspension
and Steering, Manual Drive Train and Axles, and Automatic Transmissions.  There
are also tests for collision repair/refinish technicians, engine machinists,
parts specialists, and medium/heavy truck technicians.<P>

The exams are no cinch to pass; on average, one out of three test takers fail
any given exam.  But those who pass and fulfill the work experience requirement
earn the title of ASE-certified Automobile Technician, while those who pass all
eight auto exams earn Master Auto Technician status.<P>

Every ASE technician is issued credentials listing his (or her) exact areas of
certification and an appropriate shoulder insignia.<P>

Nor does it end there:  certification is not for life; ASE requires its
technicians to recertify every five years to keep up with technology and to
stay certified.
<h3>
How to Find an ASE Certified Technician</h3>
ASE-certified technicians can be found at every type of repair facility:  new
car dealerships, independent garages, service stations, tire dealers, special
shops, and major franchises.  There are about 375,000 ASE technicians at work
across the nation.<P>

Repair facilities with one or more ASE-certified technicians are entitled to
display the blue and white ASE sign and post their certified technicians'
credentials in the customer service area.
<h3>
Choosing the Right Technician</h3>
As with physicians, auto technicians specialize.  Because ASE offers
certification in all major technical areas of auto repair and service, it's
wise to ask the shop owner or service manager specifically for a technician who
is certified in the appropriate area, say, brakes, engine repair, or air
conditioning.  The technicians are issued pocket-sized credential cards listing
their exact areas of certification.<P>

For free information about ASE technician certification, send a business-sized,
self-addressed, stamped envelope to:  ASE Consumer Brochure, Dept. CCC-F95,
P.O. Box 347, Herndon, VA  22070.<P>

<h2>
A Checklist </h2>
Here are some tips from the non-profit National Institute for Automotive
Service Excellence (ASE) on finding a good repair establishment:
<ul>
<li>Start shopping for a repair facility <i>before</i> you need one.
<li>Ask friends and associates for recommendations; consult local consumer
organizations.
<li>Arrange for alternate transportation in advance so you will not feel forced
to choose a shop based solely on location.
<li>Look for a neat, well organized facility, with some vehicles in the parking
lot equal in value to your own and modern equipment in the service bays.
<li>Look for a courteous staff, with a service writer willing to answer all of
your questions.
<li>Look for policies regarding labor rates, diagnostic fees, guarantees,
acceptable methods of payment, etc.
<li>Ask if the repair facility specializes or if it usually handles your type
of repair work.
<li>Look for signs of professionalism in the customer service area such as
civic, community, or customer service awards.
<li>Look for evidence of qualified technicians: trade school diplomas,
certificates of advanced course work, and certification by ASE.

<h1>
Auto Repair Improves With Good Communication
</h1>
</center>
Ask a car owner why that grinding noise in her brakes has gone unchecked and
she'll probably say it's too big of a hassle or she's short on cash. However,
the real reason may be a problem that's capturing the attention of the media,
the public, and even law enforcement officials nationwide:  SHE'S AFRAID SHE'S
GOING TO GET RIPPED OFF.<P>

If repair fraud is one of your fears, you're not alone. The National Better
Business Bureau reports that auto repair and service is a leading consumer
complaint. But this industry is not burying its head in the sand. Instead, it's
turning the fraud fiasco into an opportunity, and motorists are the
beneficiaries.<P>

"Professional shop owners are going the extra mile to build this trust,
especially when communicating with customers."<P>

The key words are trust and communication. Because it takes communication to
build trust, car owners and their technicians must not only communicate, but
communicate effectively. How is that done? Here are some suggestions.<P>

First, inquire about your technician's  ASE (Automotive Service Excellence)
credentials. This "communicates" that you expect the person who repairs your
car to be judged competent by the standards of a national organization.<P>

Second, take a list with you that "communicates" every aspect of your car's
problem. It's not enough to say you're having brake trouble. Does the car
shimmy when it comes to a stop? What about when you're slowing down but don't
come to a full stop: What does the noise sound like? These are the things
customers often forget to mention, yet they are priceless tools for the
technician, saving him valuable diagnostic time. <P>

The third "communication" suggestion is the most important. Get a written
estimate that includes a  statement saying no additional work will be done
without your authorization. This is also the time to inquire about the warranty
offered on the work and parts. If you're new to this facility, and want to
double-check their diagnosis, get a second opinion. If the estimate sounds too
pricey, call other shops and see what they'd charge for that job.<P>

Fourth, read your bill. If you have any questions, ASK. Make sure the repair
warranty you discussed earlier is included.<P>

Fifth, when you pick up your car, drive it around the block BEFORE you pay the
bill. If the problem still persists, it's easier to "communicate" your concern
at this point.<P>

Finally, there is the advantage that plastic has over real, live, paper money,
and that is recourse. If you have a problem with a service facility, simply
notify your credit card company that you are dissatisfied. Until the dispute is
settled, you won't owe the repair shop a dime.<P>

The extent to which your service center can satisfy you is somewhat dependent
upon the information you provide. Communicating what you expect of them is the
best way to enjoy a long and happy relationship with your automotive
technician.<P>

The Car Care Council offers a free pamphlet called, "HOW TO FIND YOUR WAY UNDER
THE HOOD AND AROUND THE CAR." To receive a copy, send a self-addressed, stamped
envelope to Car Care Council, Department UH, One Grande Lake Drive, Port
Clinton, Ohio 43452.<P>

Cool Runnin'</H1>
</center>Whether your vehicle has
manual air conditioner (A/C) or an automatic temperature control system, it is
generations ahead of the A/C systems found in vehicles a decade ago.  Both
automatic and manual  A/C systems use electronic controls and interact
extensively with other vehicle systems.  As a result, specific equipment is
required to ensure proper diagnosis and service.<P>

In addition, responding to environmental and legislative pressures, leading
automakers have redesigned car, van and truck A/C systems to eliminate the use
of R-12 (freon), which has been shown to cause damage to the earth's ozone
layer.  <P>

Most '94 (and some '93) vehicle A/C systems operate using an "ozone friendly"
new refrigerant called R-134a.  Ask your local auto service professional which
type of refrigerant is used in the vehicle you own or are considering buying.<P>

Don't worry, whether your car's A/C uses R-12 or R-134a, you'll still be able
to stay cool on those hot summer days.  That is, of course, as long as you keep
it properly maintained.  Since the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
outlawed the sale of R-12 in small containers, the days of topping off a car's
A/C with a quick shot of freon are over.  <P>

<b>Caution</b>: Don't be fooled by so-called "drop in" replacements.  The EPA
has not approved anything other than original-type refrigerants for use in
vehicle A/C systems.  Furthermore, service industry experts warn that
unapproved refrigerant blends can cause significant and costly damage to A/C
and other system components.<P>

"Oh great," you say.  "What am I going to do now that I can't simply replace
the R-12 that leaks out?"  According to Bob Lanzendorf, Product Manager for
Everco Industries, a leading supplier of A/C replacement products, the answer
is simple.  "Treat it like any other part of today's high-tech vehicle and have
it serviced by a professional," he said.  "Having your car's A/C maintained by
experts lets you stay cool on the hottest summer days, while helping to
safeguard our earth's fragile environment for future generations."<P>

"So," you say, "how do I find out if an auto service facility can do the job
right?"  Just ask.  Most service shops have invested in equipment and training
to prepare their technicians to work on both R-12 and newer R-134a A/C systems.
They will be glad to show you their credentials and explain system changes. You
may even notice signs at local repair shops announcing "ozone friendly" A/C
service and repairs.<P>

Cars Cooling System Service</H1>
</center>
Since the colder months will
soon be upon us, there are several things considered critical in your vehicle's
maintenance.  And since the engine is the heart of your vehicle and directly
affects its operation, here is what you can do to ensure proper engine life and
performance.  A vehicle's cooling system should be serviced seasonally to
prevent premature engine wear due to extreme climate or engine temperature.  <P>

According to Everco Industries, a leading manufacturer of automotive cooling
system parts, one sure way to prepare the engine's cooling system for these
extreme climate conditions is to have your local service dealer perform a few
basic preventive maintenance checks during your next routine servicing:
<ol>
<li><b>Check for external leaks.</b>  Usual areas of leakage are water
manifolds, radiator seams, water pumps, freeze plugs and all hose connections.
The condition of radiator hoses should be carefully scrutinized for possible
deterioration from age and/or wear from rubbing against accessory brackets,
etc.  Be aware that in many cases radiator hoses wear from the inside out, so
outside appearance can be deceiving.
<li><b>Check for internal leaks.  </b>Pull the oil dipstick and check for
evidence of coolant.  It will show up as minute droplets or sludge and should
be easy to spot.  This could indicate a cracked head, block or blown head
gasket.
<li><b>Check the radiator.</b>  This is the one component in your vehicle's
cooling system which can quickly diminish the efficiency and durability of the
engine.  Check for obstructed air flow and clean any debris from the fins.
Also check the radiator mounting for loose bolts or cracked brackets from
vibration and stress.
<li><b>Check the cooling fan.</b>  If the vehicle is equipped with a
centrifugal thermo-static type fan clutch, it is important to spot problems
before they occur.  Check for wear by moving the fan blade back and forth.
Over 1/4" of play in either direction could point towards excessive bearing
wear.  You should also turn the fan by hand.  If it free-wheels or there is a
rough grating feel as the fan turns, this could mean excessive fluid loss or
bearing wear respectively.  If any of these conditions exist or there is
evidence of fluid leakage, the fan clutch should be replaced.  If the vehicle
is equipped with an electric cooling fan, a quick performance check can be made
by turningon the A/C and checking to make sure it operates without excess
vibration or noise.  Also check all electrical connections for signs of
corrosion, or physical damage.  With the engine hot, check to see if the fan is
coming on at the correct temperature and operating properly. 
<li><b>Check the coolant level and conditions.</b>  As a general rule the
coolant level should be 1" to 2" below the radiator filler neck when cool.  Use
an antifreeze tester to determine the protection range of the coolant.  It
should be at least adequate for the geographic area where you live.  If the
coolant is over two years old or has rust in it, system flushing and refilling
with new antifreeze solution is recommended and will be sufficient for most
climates.  The two year replacement interval is necessary to maintain proper
rust inhibitor and other additive protection in the cooling system.
<li><b>Check the radiator cap.</b>  If your cap is rusted or the rubber seal is
dried out, it should be replaced.  A pressure tester should be used to be sure
the cap is operating at the recommended pressure level.
<li><b>Check the thermostat.</b>  Remove the radiator cap and start the engine.
Insert a suitable thermometer into the radiator neck.  When the coolant level
drops in the radiator, the thermostat has opened and is allowing circulation.
Record the temperature on the thermometer and compare to the thermostat
specifications.  It should be no more than a few degrees either way of the
actual thermostat setting.  If you are not in the correct range, the thermostat
will have to be replaced.  Be sure to install a new gasket and inspect the
thermostat seating area for corrosion and pitting.
<li><b>Check drive belts.</b>  Visually inspect all belts for glazing or
deterioration.  These conditions usually are caused by wear but can be
accelerated by improper adjustment, engine fluid spillage, lubricant leakage or
improper belt sizing.  Check the vehicle manufacturer's specification listing
for proper belt size, tension and/or deflection specifications.
<li><b>Check heater operation.</b>  A quick functional testing of the heater
unit can save a lot of mid-season grief.  Visually inspect all hoses for
deterioration from age and wear.  Also make sure hoses are not taut.  This
situation can cause leaks at the heater core.  Check the floor under the heater
assembly for signs of coolant loss.  This could point towards a leaking heater
core.  Also make sure to check the heater valve.  Check vacuum lines for
leakage or deterioration.  Lubricate all control cables, such as the heater
valve control cable, etc.  Last but not least, check all function switches and
blower motor switches for proper operation.  Having basic cooling system checks
made during routine servicing can prevent costly breakdowns and inefficient
operation of equipment during extreme climate conditions.  Preventive
maintenance is the key to being able to drive your car longer while reducing
long term expenses.</ol>

<h2>
"Tune-up" Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flush dirt, bugs and leaves from front of radiator with a brush and garden
hose.
<li>Inspect the radiator cap.  Replace it if the rubber gasket is broken, dried
out or missing.
<li>Check the condition and level of coolant.  If it is rusty, clean the system
and replace with a 50/50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol anti-freeze.
<li>Inspect radiator and radiator hoses for leaks, cracks or soft, mushy
condition.  Tighten all clamps.  Replace hoses as needed.
<li>Look for the heater hose running from the engine, through the firewall, to
the heater core under the dash.  Replace swollen or cracked hoses.  To check
the hoses, start the engine and turn on the heater.  If after ten minutes the
hoses are cool, they could be clogged.
<li>Inspect all engine belts for wear and cracks.  Replace if worn, cracked or
glazed.  Adjust loose belts.  Note:  Some engines have a V-ribbed belt that
drives some or all of the accessories.  If the belt grooves show excessive
cracks or "chunking", replace the belt.
<li>Check the thermostat operation by running the engine for 10-15 minutes.
Generally, it's OK if you can feel warm coolant surging through the upper hose.
Beware of an engine that runs too hot or too cool.  Tighten loose bolts on the
thermostat housing at the engine.
<li>Clean the engine exterior.  Excessive oil and dirt will hide leaks, or
insulate the engine, causing it to run hot.
</ul>

</center>Does your car have aluminum
cylinder heads?  If you don't know it would be wise to find out, says the Car
Care Council.  Aluminum heads are more vulnerable to damage from overheating
than the traditional cast iron type.  Excessive heat can warp the
temperature-sensitive heads, resulting in a major repair expense.  And it can
happen so fast you may not have been aware your car was in trouble.<P>

The most common causes of overheating, according to the Council, is loss of
coolant due to a leak.  Another culprit is a sticking thermostat, which
prevents coolant from circulating through the engine.<P>

The Council recommends an annual inspection of cooling system components,
including a pressure test to look for leaks.<P>

Avoid the expense and inconvenience of a breakdown on the road, far from home.
Overheating, a leading cause of mechanical breakdowns, is notorious for
interrupting vacation travel.<P>

For a free pamphlet on cooling system maintenance, send a stamped, self
addressed envelope to Car Care Council, Dept. CS, One Grande Lake Drive, Port
Clinton, OH 43452.<P>

<Title>Have You Flushed Your Cooling System?</TITLE>

Have You Flushed Your Cooling System?</H1>
</center>Your car ran fine all summer
with no sign of trouble, so why bother with it this fall?<P>

Here's why.  The cost of overhauling an engine can run into thousands of
dollars; automatic transmission repairs also are expensive.  And cooling system
neglect could be responsible.<P>

This system performs several functions:  (1) it must keep the engine running
within specified temperatures, not too hot and not too cold;  (2) it cools the
automatic transmission and, lest we forget,  (3) it circulates hot water
through the heater.  <P>

Temperatures inside an engine may soar to 4,500 - 5,000 degrees F., enough to
melt an engine block in a matter of minutes if it were not for the cooling
system.<P>

Over the years there have been numerous developments that make it harder for
the cooling system to perform these tasks.  Today's engines run much hotter
than in years gone by.  Added emission control systems, smaller radiators and
crowded engine compartments add to the challenge.<P>

Use this check list  to be sure your car will survive the cold months ahead.<P>

To avoid problems resulting from rust, dirt and mineral deposits in the cooling
system, it's best to give it an internal cleaning every year or two.
<h3>
It's Easy!  Here's How:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Begin with the engine cold and ignition off.  Remove the radiator pressure
cap.
<li>Open the petcock at the bottom of the radiator and drain the coolant into a
bucket.
<li>Close the petcock and fill the radiator with water.
<li>Start the engine and turn the heater control to hot.  Add cooling system
cleaner and idle the engine for 30 minutes (or as per the instructions on
container).
<li>Stop the engine and allow it to cool for five minutes.  Drain the system.
<li>Close the petcock, fill the radiator with water and let the engine idle for
five minutes.
<li>Repeat step No. 5.  Close the petcock.
<li>Install new 50/50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol
antifreeze/coolant.</ol>

Buy Quality Booster Cables</h1></center>
A precautionary message in your car owner's manual or on top of your battery
tells how to connect jumper cables safely to prevent sparks and a possible
explosion.  An additional statement might warn about the dangers of using
substandard quality jumper cables.  These can produce a situation similar to
connecting a thin, poorly insulated extension cord to an electric heater.  The
wire could heat up, eventually melting the insulation and causing a short
circuit.  In household wiring a fuse or circuit breaker probably would prevent
a fire.  In the case of jumper cables, where there is no circuit breaker
protection, inadequate strands of wiring, leading to melted insulation, could
be a real hazard.<P>

Among other shortcomings of inferior booster cables include:
<ul>
<li>High resistance in inferior cables can damage the starter motor when
subjected to long periods of cranking.
<li>Flimsy, poorly insulated clamps with weak springs can provide poor
electrical connections.
<li>Poor quality cable jackets (insulation) become excessively stiff in
freezing weather.</ul>The engineers of Associated Equipment Corporation offer
tips on features to look for:
<ul>
<li>Built in warning lights to signal incorrect connection.
<li>Flexible cable guards at the clamp handle to prevent wear at stress points.
<li>Pure copper wire in the cables for best conductivity.
<li>Adequate length and gauge of cable (12 - 16 ft; 4 gauge).
<li>Tangle-free design with a heavy duty insulated jacket.
<li>Clamps covered with bonded vinyl insulation.
<li>Insulated clamp jaw with no exposed metal parts which could arc when
contacting vehicle frame or other parts.
<li>Clamps should fit both top or side terminal batteries.</ul>

Oh Say, Can You Be Seen?</h1></center>
How often have you had to brake suddenly with another driver right on your
tail?  Your eyes dart to the rearview mirror, hoping he'll see your brake
lights in time.  <P>

But what if your brake lights aren't working properly?  There's better than a
50/50  chance they're NOT, according to figures from a survey by American
Automobile Club of Cleveland, OH.  They found 55% of vehicles checked had brake
lights that needed some kind of repairs.  This was by far the most prevalent
mechanical discrepancy found during a Car Care Clinic.<P>

Bob Knop, manager of the Club's Approved Auto Repair Department, which conducts
the clinics, says most problems were found with the  brake light, generally
because of a burned out bulb.
<h3>
Our Subconscious Response to Lighting</h3>
"We've grown to depend on lighting to signal our intentions," says Janine Sine,
Manager for the  G.E. Automotive Lighting Division.  "We respond almost
subconsciously to fellow motorists' turn signals, brake lights or emergency
flashers.  It's a form of communication as vital to driving as road signs and
center lane marking.  When they're missing we're unaware of the danger
ahead."<P>

Another common lighting problem, according to Sine, is found on vehicles with
four light systems with separate units for high and low beams.  Because the
high beam lamps are replaced less often the lens is subjected to years of abuse
from pebbles and other road debris.  Eventually hair-line cracks develop and
moisture works its way inside, corroding the reflector.  The unit may appear to
be working OK but it is not putting out as much light as it should.
<h3>
Lights on for Safety</h3>
"Some day it may be widespread practice in the U.S., as it is in Canada and
Sweden, that headlights be turned on whenever the car is driven.  It's a proven
safety measure and already is the law in the U.S. on two wheeled vehicles where
lights automatically turn on with the ignition switch.  Obviously, they are
more visible to other drivers," says Sine.<P>

"An Avis traveler safety study showed vehicles with daytime running lights
(DRL) had a better accident record than vehicles not so equipped."<P>

But lights are worthless if they are not working, Sine emphasizes.  All
exterior lights should be checked periodically, not only for burned out bulbs
and flashers but also for poor illumination of headlamps due to damaged
reflectors.<P>

The best way to check your system is to have one person turn on the lights, the
emergency flashers and turn signals and apply the brakes while someone else
walks around the vehicle to see that everything is working.<P>

It's also a good habit during every gas fill-up to check for dirt (and ice) on
all lenses, front and rear.  To help maintain cleanliness you can apply a glass
treatment such as   RAIN X<sup>(TM)</sup> to help repel rain, sleet, and snow. 
<h3>
Proper Headlight Aim is Important</h3>
At one time or another most of us have been blinded by the glare of oncoming
headlights.  You flash your high beams to signal the oncoming driver to dim his
lights.  He responds by turning on his high beams, indicating it was his low
beams that had been blinding you.  They were aimed too high.<P>

Are you sure your headlights are not blinding others?  Here, from G.E., is the
recommended way to check headlight aim.
<ol>
<li>Put your car on a 35-40 foot stretch of flat or evenly sloped pavement such
as a driveway facing a wall or garage door.
<li>Shine your low beams on the door from 2 to 3 feet away and outline the
bright spots on the door with a pencil or tape.
<li>Back the car to about 25 feet from the door.  The top of the low beams
should shine no higher than the top of the marks on the door or lower than the
center of the marked circle.  If your vehicle has four headlights the center of
the high beam (the inner or lower two lights) should align with the top of the
low beam marks.  If you have only two headlights, the high beams are
automatically aimed when you aim the low beams.</ol>For most accurate aiming
take your vehicle to a professional.  If, on the other hand, you're a
"do-it-yourselfer", follow these instructions from G.E.:<P>

Remove the outer trim for access to the adjustment screws.  To raise the beam
turn the top adjustment screw clockwise; counter clockwise to lower the beam.
Turn the side adjustment screw clockwise to move the beam to the right and
counterclockwise to move it to the left.<P>

Bring each beam into its final position by turning the adjusting screws
clockwise so the headlamp will be held against its tension springs when the
operation is completed.<P>

If your lights continue to be out of adjustment, consult a service
technician.<P>

Oxygen Sensors</H1>
</center>Modern, sophisticated cars
don't require as much servicing as older models.  Still, if your car was built
since the mid-1980s, chances are it has an oxygen sensor in its exhaust system.
You may never have encountered an oxygen sensor before, but according to car
care experts at AlliedSignal it's a part which requires periodic replacement as
part of your routine servicing.  Otherwise, you could experience poor vehicle
performance on the highway.<P>

"An oxygen sensor is designed to measure the oxygen content of a car's exhaust
gases," explains Paul Coccari, product manager of AlliedSignal's Autolite
electronics.  "This information helps the engine-control computer regulate the
mixture of air and fuel burned in the engine to provide an optimal balance of
power, economy and clean exhaust."<P>

Coccari adds that oxygen sensors are relatively simple to replace with most
models costing $50 to $100.  Replacement intervals range from 30,000 to 50,000
miles, and are generally listed in the owner's manual.<P>

While on-time oxygen sensor replacement is vital, many motorists don't have the
job done when they should because there isn't a noticeable difference in the
way a car drives when the sensor stops functioning normally.  Some motorists
may even skip oxygen sensor servicing on purpose, figuring there's no need to
do anything until the car starts to "act up".<P>

"Either way, they're making an expensive mistake," Coccari explains.  "An
engine may use  too much fuel when the oxygen sensor isn't working.  This
doesn't just hurt economically, it also  creates dirty exhaust, polluting the
air."<P>

An alert motorist may notice worsening fuel mileage or driveability problems
and have the sensor changed, says Coccari.  But he adds that since most drivers
don't notice anything wrong until driveability suffers, dirty exhaust may
already be coming from the vehicle creating an environmental problem.
<h3>
Seeing The Light</h3>
Because oxygen sensor replacement is important, many car makers include
hard-to-ignore reminders, like a glowing red light on the instrument panel as
the sensor replacement interval approaches.  Coccari says the light keeps
glowing (while the ignition is on) until the car is serviced.
<h3>
Another Indicator</h3>
Some cars' instrument panels include a different dash light meant to indicate
problems with components of the engine control system, including the oxygen
sensor and other items.  Typically, these lights are labeled "service engine
soon," "check engine," "power loss," or something similar.  If your car uses
this system (check your owner's manual), Coccari says you still must replace
your oxygen sensor at the mileage interval specified by the car maker.<P>

Coccari explains that the light won't come on simply to let you know it's time
to replace your oxygen sensor, it's up to you to keep track of when the sensor
needs servicing. <P>

"Since its glowing may indicate one or more of a number of problems, a service
technician will have to `interrogate' your car's computer to find out which
system or systems aren't working correctly.  Further tests may then be needed
to find out what's wrong with the affected system or systems."<P>

If you're a serious do-it-yourselfer (DIYer), Coccari says to consult the
correct shop manual for your car if this light comes on.  In many cases, the
manual will explain step-by-step procedures to make the light signal (using
semaphore-type flashing codes) where the problems lie.
<h3>
Care About Your Car</h3>
Coccari says routine auto servicing is different than it was a few years ago.
Though in most respects it's easier, it still comes down to paying a little now
or a lot later.<P>

"Today's high-tech cars don't need constant attention, but there hasn't been a
car invented yet that can take care of itself.  Make a point of learning your
new car's service requirements.  As with the oxygen sensor, something you've
never heard of before may need occasional attention."<P>

<H1>How To Offset Higher Gas</h1></center>
One way to deal with increased gas prices is to drive less.  Another is to
improve your driving habits; easy on the gas pedal.  But old habits are hard to
break.<P>

Another conservation measure is to be sure your car is using no more fuel than
it was designed to use by keeping track of your gas mileage.<P>

You may not notice a drop in fuel economy month by month but it could add up to
well over $150 a year.  The Car Care Council bases this figure on the typical
car using 500 gallons of gas a year at $1.10 per gallon, it works out like this:
<ol>
<li>If the engine needs a tune-up it could be wasting 15% (or more) of its
fuel, due to misfiring spark plugs, inefficient fuel system and malfunctioning
emission controls.  The cost: about $5.00 per month.
<li>If tires are 8 pounds underinflated, not an uncommon condition, rolling
resistance of the tires increases by 5%.  The monthly cost in wasted gas:
$2.30.
<li>If wheels are just 1/4" out of alignment, another factor that affects
rolling resistance, chalk up another 2% or about $1.00 a month.  Note:  this
condition, as well as underinflation, accelerates tire wear, thereby adding to
the cost of neglect.
<li>A cooling system thermostat stuck in the open position, causing the engine
to run too cool, can reduce engine efficiency by another 7%.  The monthly cost:
$3.20.</ol>That adds up to a monthly loss of $11.50, says the Council.  They
point out that, while this hypothesis is intended to emphasize preventive
maintenance in terms of energy conservation, it also bears on safety and
reduced exhaust emissions.<P>

And, going back to hard-to-break habits, for every five miles per hour you
press beyond 55 mph, you'll lose about one mile per gallon.  A heavy foot when
the light turns green also guzzles gas.<P>

Springtime Ritual</H1>
</center>Springtime.  Time to shake
the winter doldrums.  Whether you have traveled great distances over the winter
or stayed home by the fire, it's important to make sure you perform a thorough
inspection of your vehicle before heading out on a family vacation.  <P>

"Many times people neglect their vehicles over the winter due to the cold or
the belief that the car is fine because they didn't use it that much," explains
Gary Donahue, lead trainer for AlliedSignal Automotive Aftermarket.  "However,
sludge can build-up in the engine and cause expensive problems down the road.
The quickest, and easiest, way to avoid this problem is installing fresh oil
and a quality oil filter."
<h3>
Easy To Do</h3>
Changing the oil and filter isn't very complicated.  Donahue explains that on
many cars, the oil drain plug is easily accessible and can be removed without
having to raise the vehicle.  Likewise, the oil filter is easily accessible and
can be removed either by hand or with an oil filter wrench.<P>

"Any pan or basin with a capacity of a couple of gallons will give you plenty
of room to handle the four to six quarts of oil contained in most engines,"
Donahue explains.  "You get it to come out by simply unscrewing the oil drain
plug from the oil pan at the bottom of the engine counterclockwise.  It's
always best to take the car for a short ride to warm the oil before removing.
This will make it flow easier."<P>

Once you've changed the oil, be sure the drain plug is in place, and add fresh
oil.  Make sure you use a quality oil.  A quick check of your owner's manual
will give you the recommended weight and quantity for your driving
conditions.<P>

Most oil filters on cars today are a spin-on unit.  They can easily be removed
by hand or using a filter wrench according to Donahue.  After removal, make
sure the oil filter base of the engine where you'll be installing the new
filter is wiped clean.  Then, before you screw the filter into place, coat the
gasket with clean oil.  Once the gasket contacts the base, tighten it according
to manufacturer's instructions.<P>

With the new filter in place, check the dipstick to be sure there's enough oil,
start the car and let it idle.  Check for leaks while it's running, then check
the dipstick again.  You may need to add oil to make up for the amount that was
pumped into the new filter.<P>

You're almost done.  With one major exception - what do you do with the old oil
and oil filter.
<h3>
Clean-up/Recycle</h3>
Properly disposing of the used oil and oil filter is not only critical to
protecting the environment, it's being regulated in many states as landfills
are becoming overcrowded.  Recycling only 20% of all filters produced annually
will:
<ul>
<li>save nearly 400,000 cubic yards of landfill space;
<li>remove several million gallons of oil from landfills; and,
<li>recycle more than 34,000 tons of filter scrap which can be used to produce
steel products.</ul><h3>
Proper Steps</h3>
After you drain the oil, put it in a recyclable container that you can easily
transport in your car to the recycling center.  This can be a container made
especially for oil changes, an old plastic liter soda bottle or other container
that can be sealed to avoid spillage.<P>

Once you've removed the old filter, and initially drained it of used oil into
your collection pan:
<ul>
<li>Drain the filter over an oil collection pan for approximately 12 hours to
remove all free flowing oil;
<li>Put the oil from the filter into the plastic jug containing the oil from
your car;
<li>Place the used oil filter in a leak proof bag or container and transfer it,
along with the used oil, to the nearest designated recycling facility.</ul>The
used oil and filter should be taken to your nearest recycling center that
accepts used motor oil.  Designated locations for recycling may be a local
municipal drop off recycling center, a municipal garage or a business providing
oil change services.  Some of these facilities may also accept your used
filter.<P>

For more information on recycling sites in your area, contact the recycling
coordinator for your community or look under recycling in  the Yellow Pages.

</center>Car care and health care:
what's the connection?  Ask anyone whose bald tires lead landed him in the
emergency room.  Ask an asthmatic who becomes ill from thick air pollution in
rush hour traffic.<P>
The latter is a serious issue with environmentalists as well as automotive
designers.  1994 model cars produce a fraction of the harmful emissions that
their 1984 predecessors did.<P>
Still, nearly two thirds of the total carbon monoxide, more than a quarter of
the hydrocarbons and a third of the nitrogen oxides which pollute our
atmosphere come from motor vehicles.  These percentages decrease dramatically
as the vehicle population, with enhanced emission control systems, gets
younger.  And as we improve maintenance of existing vehicles we significantly
reduce harmful exhaust.<P>
Periodic engine checkups, along with necessary maintenance, can make a big
difference in exhaust emissions.  Even the simple replacement of a dirty air
filter, one of the most common offenders, can reduce emissions and save gas.<P>
Car Care Council offers a few more things motorists should know about vehicle
condition:<P>
If smoke is coming out of the exhaust, it may mean:
<ul>
<li>The fuel system is malfunctioning;
<li>The engine control computer system is malfunctioning;
<li>The engine may need major work due to worn piston rings or valves.</ul>If
an exhaust analyzer shows high carbon monoxide content, it may mean:
<ul>
<li>The air filter is dirty;
<li>The PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) system is clogged;
<li>The cold start system is malfunctioning;
<li>The fuel system is operating too rich;
<li>The ignition timing is incorrectly adjusted;
<li>The thermostatic air control is malfunctioning;
<li>The air injection system is  malfunctioning.</ul>If an exhaust analyzer
show high hydrocarbon content it may mean:
<ul>
<li>Fouled spark plugs;
<li>Faulty spark plug wires;
<li>Faulty ignition cap or rotor;
<li>Incorrect ignition timing;
<li>The fuel system is too rich;
<li>There's a vacuum leak.</ul>For most cars, with their numerous sensors,
computers and other electronic circuitry, accurate diagnosis is a "must".  In
the long run this procedure, along with needed service, can save time, fuel
and, of course, our environment.<P>

<h1>
A Reminder to Business Owners and Managers:</h1></center>
<h2>
Is Your Delivery Vehicle Driving Business Away?</h2>
Mrs. Hayes was about to call M &amp; K Carpet Service when one of their vans
rumbled down her street. Because the muffler was gone, the noise was deafening;
the sign on the side was scratched, the vehicle was filthy and, in general, it
looked as if M &amp; K didn't give a hoot.<P>

Mrs. Hayes sat down to rethink her choice, and a potential customer quickly
became a lost opportunity.<P>

Whether a business uses a single delivery vehicle or an entire fleet, it's
important for owners and managers to understand that those vehicles not only
deliver products, they also deliver valuable impressions to the community. You
can portray the right impression by maintaining the exterior of your vehicle
and keeping a close watch under the hood.<P>

Overall body appearance is of the utmost importance. Chipped paint, broken
signal lights and/or damaged body parts affect your vehicle's looks as well as
its value. Regular washing and waxing combined with seasonal cleaning helps not
only add years to the life of a paint job, it says you care about your
business.<P>

Now examine the accessories that can affect the looks as well as the safety of
your vehicle. Broken mirrors, missing or mismatched hubcaps or a bent antenna
are just a few of the difficulties that can plague a delivery vehicle. The good
news is that these items are generally simple and inexpensive to repair.<P>

The last exterior detail is perhaps the most important:  the sign painted on
your vehicle. This "billboard on wheels" not only says what you do, but how you
do it. Consider the negative impression of a dirty, faded, peeling or chipped
sign.<P>

The best looking vehicle in town is useless if it's not functional. Excessive
downtime due to neglect can nibble at profits until there's nothing left.<P>

A businessman should think of  his delivery vehicle as an important business
machine that cannot go unserviced. Someone should be put in charge of regular
maintenance of that machine. Whether it's the owner, the delivery person or a
third party, remember that a job assigned to no one is no one's job.<P>

To assist the responsible party, the Council offers a free pamphlet listing the
main areas to be checked regularly. Send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to
Car Care Council, Dept. UH., One Grande Lake Drive, Port Clinton, OH 43452.<P>

Keep Car Cool</h1></center>
Summer heat is hard on a car's interior.  It can cause the headliner (ceiling
fabric) to droop, the padded dash to crack and upholstery to fade.<P>

Many summer related problems can be addressed with a little common sense.  Try
to park in the shade.  Avoid those wide open spaces that allow relentless full
time exposure to the sun.<P>

Try to park near a building to assure your car of some shade at least part of
the time.<P>

Finally, purchase a sun shade.  These inexpensive cardboard blockers placed in
the windshield and rear windows help lower the interior temperature.<P>

More tips on protecting your car's interior are in a free pamphlet, `HOW TO
KEEP YOUR CAR LOOKING YOUNG', published by the Car Care Council.  Send a
stamped, self addressed envelope to the Car Care Council, Dept. N, One Grande
Lake Drive, Port Clinton, OH  43452.<P>

Fixing Up That Ailing Car or Replace?</h1></center>
<h2>
This May Help You Make A Decision</h2>
<address><i>By Donna Wagner, Director of Operations, Car Care Council, Port
Clinton, OH</i></address><P>
The new models are out, and many of us look longingly at the variety of sleek,
new vehicles in dealers' showrooms.  Meanwhile, "Old Faithful" sits at home in
the driveway.  She's in need of new tires, a brake job and some fresh paint,
but she's paid for.  And so the dilemma begins.<P>

When an aging car needs repairs, too often the solution lies in the quickest
route to the car dealer.  But what if the down payment (plus a little extra)
were spent on your old car instead, making it serviceable for another year or
two?  Statistics show that more owners are fixing up and driving their old
cars.  In fact, the average car age (9 years) is the highest it's been since
the early 1950's.<P>

To renew or replace?  It's a big decision with several pros and cons to
consider.  Here are some points in favor of renewing:
<ul>
<li>No big car payments and, therefore, an opportunity to save for a future new
car purchase;
<li>Less sales tax to pay;
<li>Savings on insurance premiums;
<li>A new car loses an average of 25% of its value when it leaves the lot; 40%
of its value in four years;
<li>You know your old car's problems and quirks;
<li>Your old car will be in better shape for future trade.</ul>Of course in
every financial endeavor there is a point of diminishing return.  Trading cars
is no different.  If the cost of the combined repairs far exceeds the value of
your old car, chances are you should trade up.  Consider the following points
that favor replacing.
<ul>
<li>Has your life-style (family size, business, recreational interests) changed
so that "Old Faithful", even fully restored would no longer fit your needs?
<li>If you have neglected maintenance and repairs too long your car may need
major mechanical work.  For example, overhauling both the engine and
transmission on a typical car may cost $2,000.  If this price exceeds  the
value of your car, it's probably time for a new or newer vehicle.
<li>Even if the mechanical systems can be restored for a reasonable price, will
body and/or interior fix-up work be costly?
<li>How important are state-of-the-art safety and fuel economy features of a
newer vehicle?  How vital is the "image" created by the vehicle parked in your
driveway?</ul>In the end, you are the only one who can put pencil to paper and
make the decision.  More information is available in the pamphlet, "Renew vs.
Replace (Rx for Making a Decision)."  Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope
to Car Care Council, Dept. R, One Grande Lake Drive, Port Clinton, OH  43452.<P>

Auto Log Book Pays
</H1>
</center>
<P>
Logging, defined as the act
of entering information in a log book, is done by pilots, fleet operators, the
military and virtually anyone to whom vehicle performance and dependability are
essential.<P>

Maintaining a log book is a good idea for private owners too, says Car Care
Council, who suggest that setting up and maintaining an auto "diary" is a
simple procedure.  It's a matter of keeping a pencil and note pad handy to
record anything of importance about the maintenance and operation of the car or
truck.<P>

Essentially there are six types of entries, according to the Council:
<ol>
<li>Gasoline fill-ups and mileage;
<li>Addition of various fluids such as engine oil, coolant, power steering
fluid and at what mileage;
<li>Maintenance services performed:  what, when, by whom and how much it cost;
<li>Services performed other than routine maintenance, i.e. body repairs or
paint, accessories installed, etc.;
<li>Insurance and/or registration information;
<li>Basic part numbers and/or specifications which may not be readily found in
the owners manual (belts, hoses, headlamps, spark plugs, filters,
etc.)</ol>Most businessmen, whose vehicle expenses are tax deductible, know the
importance of maintaining good records.  For them and for others there are
these additional considerations, say the Council:<P>

Keeping a running record of gas purchases vs. distance driven will show a
decrease in gas mileage, warning of a malfunction or need for tune-up.<P>

A log book will make you aware of abnormal oil or fluid consumption, which
could be the tip-off to a leak or other potential problem.<P>

It also serves as a reminder that the vehicle is overdue for an oil and filter
change, transmission service or other important maintenance.<P>

When it's time to sell or trade, this kind of documentation can make a
substantial difference in the vehicle's saleability.  A used car buyer likes to
know what maintenance has been done and when.<P>

In case of mechanical trouble, especially with an older vehicle, it may be
useful to report to a mechanic exactly what work has been done.<P>

If yours is an import car, you may want to jot down not only the original
numbers for basic parts but also the conversion numbers from among the readily
available domestic brands.  This can be a big time saver when a crisis occurs
far from a major source of auto parts.<P>

The Dozen Most Wanted</h1></center>
<p>
Remember how annoying that black mark was on the living room wall? Or the
squealing door hinge? Eventually it goes unnoticed. Too often we adjust to car
problems that need attention, too. According toVehicle Maintenance Council 4
out of 5 cars need maintenance, such as the items listed below. Is yours one of
them?
<ol>
<li>WORN BRAKE PARTS. Postponing needed brake service, in  addition to being a
safety hazard, can escalate the cost of a braking system overhaul.
<li>TIRED WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES. Don't wait for a rainy day to replace worn
blades.
<li>BURNED OUT LIGHTS. Can you see and be seen? Check all your lights regularly
to be sure.
<li>CLOGGED FILTERS. Scheduled replacement of air, oil, gas, fuel, transmission
and other filters extend car life and improve performance.
<li>WORN SPARK PLUGS. Worn plugs waste gas and increase exhaust emissions. They
also cause the engine to run poorly.
<li>CORRODED BATTERY CABLES. Corroded cables and a weak battery cause starting
trouble. Have battery and charging system checked if the engine turns over
slowly.
<li>GLAZED BELTS, ROTTEN HOSES. A slipping belt can affect engine cooling,
alternator, power steering, and air conditioner. Replace worn belts before they
let you down . . brittle or rotten cooling system hoses can lead to
overheating. Others, such as vacuum and power steering hoses, hinder
performance and safety.
<li>NEGLECTED COOLING SYSTEM. Periodic servicing of the cooling system helps
prevent deterioration  of  radiator or heater core.
<li>LEAKING SHOCK ABSORBERS. Worn shocks or struts affect ride control and
shorten tire life.
<li>DAMAGED CV JOINT BOOTS. These rubber boots protect the critical CV joints
that deliver power to your wheels. They should be inspected regularly and
replaced as needed.
<li>LEAKING MUFFLER. Have your car put on a lift occasionally to check the
muffler and other parts of the exhaust system.
<li>TIRED TIRES. Worn tires are dangerous. Proper inflation, alignment and
balance will extend tire life.</ol>

Face the Consequences
</H1>
</center><P>
You have probably heard your dentist say, "If you ignore your teeth they will
go away".<P>
Without proper dental hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, it is very
likely that someday you will be soaking your teeth instead of brushing them.
The same thing can be said about your car.  If you deny your car proper
preventive maintenance and avoid regular car trips to a good technician, then,
like your teeth, your car will go away.<P>
Up until the mid 1970s, most car owners practiced preventive maintenance.  This
was largely due to the fact that as the ignition points wore out and lead in
the fuel masked the spark plug, vehicle performance and economy began to
deteriorate very noticeably.  The car would then be brought in for the
proverbial "tune-up".  This tune-up usually took place about once a year or
every 12,000 or 15,000 miles.<P>
This was also a good opportunity for the technician to check for additional
maintenance needs in areas such as the radiator and heater hoses, and coolant
condition, the fan belts, the vacuum hoses, the fuel and air filters, the
canister filter and the condition of the battery, the tires and the emission
control and exhaust systems, just to name a few.<P>
With the advent of electronic ignition and unleaded fuel in the mid 1970's, as
well as the addition of computer controls in the early 1980's, the
deterioration of the cars' performance and mileage is hardly noticeable.  This,
combined with the fact that there are very few full service gas stations left
today (full service meaning that there is a knowledgeable person on hand to
check under your hood as a form of preventive maintenance while filling the
tank), causes most vehicle owners to practice what is called "reactionary
maintenance".<P>
Reactionary maintenance is when you continue to drive your car as long as it
runs well, neglecting to raise the hood to check the oil or anything else.
Then, the first time you notice a change in drive-ability, usually at 50,000 to
60,000 miles, you rush to a repair facility and want the problem fixed in a
couple of hours.<P>
And you often complain about the cost of repairs.  It may sound a little harsh,
but this scenario happens thousands of times each day across the country.<P>
Today's cars need regular, preventive maintenance.  Even though oil and
gasoline have improved, and car manufacturers will try to persuade you that
their product has improved, new cars still wear out.  Actually, new cars are
wearing out faster than old ones due to the lack of preventive maintenance.<P>
If you want your car to last as long as the payments, dig the owner's manual
out of the glove box.  Turn to the "Maintenance Instructions" section and read
it carefully.  Pay particular attention to the page which discusses oil change
intervals.  You will note that the manufacturer differentiates between "normal
driving conditions" and severe driving conditions".<P>
Usually, severe driving conditions are defined as: driving through dusty areas,
towing a trailer or boat, frequent idling or idling for long periods, and
driving for 10 miles or less in freezing weather.  Cars operated under these
conditions should have an oil and filter change every 3,000 miles or three
months, which ever occurs first.<P>
Normal driving conditions occur if your driving does not fall in any one of the
severe driving categories.  However, less than 25 percent of the cars on the
road actually qualify for the normal driving category.  In addition, if your
car is equipped with a turbo-charger, frequent oil changes are a must. <P>
If the turbo becomes coked up, it could cost as much as $1,000 to replace it,
and the factory warranty won't cover the bill if you can't show proof of oil
changes at the factory-recommended intervals.<P>
Engine coolant and transmission fluid are two more items that must be changed
regularly to ensure a long life for your car.  Engine coolant should be changed
every two years and diluted with 50 percent water, as pure engine coolant will
freeze at around 0 degrees Fahrenheit.  This mix gives you the best cold
weather protection and the best heat dissipation ability in hot weather.<P>
The life of the automatic transmission fluid is basically determined by how hot
the fluid has been during operation.  (See the chart.)  Since you have no way
of really knowing how hot the fluid has been, an easy way to check is by
pulling out the transmission dipstick and looking at the fluid.  If the fluid
is brown instead of red and smells like you just ran over a skunk, it needs to
be changed ASAP!  It is a good habit to have the transmission fluid changed
every two years or 24,000 miles.<P>
The high temperatures under the hood of today's cars take their toll on rubber
and neoprene components such as radiator and heater hoses, fuel lines, and
vacuum hoses.  One of the main causes of breakdown is fan belt and/or
radiator/heater hose failure.  The best insurance against this catastrophe is
to have the belts and hoses replaced every two years.<P>
And while on the subject of rubber, I shouldn't forget to mention the tires.
There is no reason why steel belted radial tires shouldn't last at least 70,000
miles or longer.  It takes only three things to make this happen.  1)  Have
wheel alignment and tire balance checked once a year.  2)  Keep tires properly
inflated and check weekly.  3)  Rotate tires every 6,000 miles.<P>
Perhaps the key is to examine the tires once a week.  If you notice any unusual
tire wear patterns, have a good alignment shop check the alignment, the
suspension components, and the tire balance.  Tire wear problems do not fix
themselves.<P>
One final area which I would like to discuss is the battery.  Most batteries
are replaced on the first cold morning that the car won't start.  The average
life of a battery is three and one-half years.  If you are driving around with
a battery that is older than that, then you shouldn't be surprised if you are
stranded at the train station parking lot or the shopping center when it is 10
degrees below zero and the wind is blowing at 20 m.p.h.<P>
Why not just replace the battery before this happens?  That is what preventive
maintenance is all about; looking, checking, and replacing automotive
components before they fail.  <P>
You are probably thinking to yourself that preventive maintenance is too
expensive to follow.  On the contrary, would it be more expensive to replace
the battery in your car before it leaves you stranded, or pay a service call
and a new battery plus the inconvenience of being stranded?  The fact is,
preventive maintenance is cheaper in the long run than reactionary maintenance.
The question that often remains is:  "Where do I get the money for preventive
maintenance?"   Most people budget only for car payments, insurance, and gas.<P>
All that really needs to be done is to keep the close track of the miles you
drive each week.  Set aside ten cents for each mile that you drive and place
this money in an interest bearing account. <P>
At the end of one year, if you have driven 15,000 miles, you will have saved
$1500 to spend on preventive maintenance.  That will buy a lot of maintenance.
Any money left over can either be left in the account to let your balance grow,
or can be put towards the principal of your car loan.  This will reduce both
the interest you are paying as well as the number of payments.<P>
Your car is a major investment, so why not take care of it?  If you borrow
$16,000 to purchase a car at 14 percent interest, and you pay this off over a
period of four years, you will eventually pay almost $5,000 in interest.
That's $21,000 that you pay out of your budget in a four year period.<P>
If you practice preventive maintenance, your car will outlast your payment
book.  Then, if you keep your car for another four years and make those same
car payments to yourself, you will have $21,000 to spend.  I don't know about
you, but I could think of all kinds of neat toys to buy.<P>
Remember, it is cheaper to look at, check, and replace components before
failure than it is to drive your car until it drops.  If you are not fixing
your own car, there are thousands of repair facilities across the country that
are very capable of performing the preventive maintenance which I have
discussed in this article.  Give preventive maintenance a try, and you will
find yourself with money in your pocket.<P>

Preventive Maintenance
</H1>
</center>
Today's cars come equipped
with high-tech computer-controlled systems that have vastly improved driving
performance.  But some vehicle owners are finding this state-of-the-art
technology intimidating, and many drivers put off looking under the  hood until
something goes wrong.<P>

Improvements in electronic ignition and fuel injection systems on  newer cars
have virtually eliminated the "traditional" tune-up practices of adjusting
carburetors, installing points, and setting the timing.  However, with regular
preventive maintenance, vehicle owners can still improve the performance and
fuel efficiency of today's cars.<P>

"Once they've purchased a new car, some people are led to believe that all they
have to do is drive it, fill it with gas, and change the oil-- and then they
expect it to last five or 10 years until they trade it in," said Roger Kwapich,
manager of technical services for Champion Spark Plug Co., a division of Cooper
Automotive.  Kwapich also hosts "Gasoline Alley," a radio talk show about car
care and automobiles.<P>

"Granted, the engines and transmissions being built for today's cars are far
superior to those in older models, but only if you maintain them.  And that's a
big if," Kwapich said.  "There's this perception that a car can be like a
washing machine.  That it will last for years without ever needing maintenance.
But that's not how it works in the real world."<P>

One constant in the realm of evolving engine technologies is the spark plug.  A
critical link in any engine's ignition system, misfiring or worn spark plugs
can affect how efficiently a vehicle burns the fuel/air mixture, ultimately
affecting engine performance.<P>

Cars in need of new spark plugs and a tune-up could experience measurable fuel
economy improvements,   Kwapich said.  Over the years, Champion estimates
millions of motorists have been reducing the miles-per-gallon they are
obtaining by neglecting proper care of their cars.<P>

Although tune-up intervals vary from car to car, and some owner's manuals
indicate newer models can go almost twice as long as older vehicles between
tune-ups, preventive maintenance and checking the car periodically can help
assure it continues to deliver peak performance.<P>

"Preventive maintenance today will help your car last until tomorrow,"  Kwapich
said.  Since spark plugs are often victims of other problems in an engine, they
can reveal valuable "clues" for evaluating engine performance.  By examining
the condition of the spark plugs, a professional mechanic can confirm a vehicle
is running properly, or spot minor problems before they become major
malfunctions. <P>

Many other preventive, under- the- hood checks can be accomplished by the car
owner at home without a mechanic.  No matter how high-tech the engine, just a
visual inspection of belts and hoses can reveal cracks, frays, leaks and
bulges-- sure signs of impending part failure.  And drivers can easily monitor
engine fluid levels by periodically checking to be sure oil, radiator, battery,
power steering, brake and automatic transmission fluids are filled to
recommended levels.<P>

Regularly rotating the tires can also pay off big, not just in better handling
and energy efficiency, but  in safety, too.<P>

"Lots of people overlook the need for maintenance because they still perceive
their car as brand new," Kwapich explained.  "For instance, people often buy
new cars right before they leave on vacation, then forget that those
accumulated miles may warrant an oil change or tire rotation when their vehicle
is only a couple of months old."<P>

Today's high-tech automobiles can accumulate a lot of mileage with very little
evidence of wear and tear, making it easy for motorists to avoid looking under
the hood while their vehicle is running well.  But preventive maintenance can
be a valuable investment, increasing fuel efficiency and saving the expense of
emergency repair service, towing charges and even the inconvenience of a
breakdown.<P>

"If car owners put a few dollars into maintenance, they are almost certain to
get better overall performance and vehicle longevity," Kwapich said.<P>

You're Only As Safe As Your Car's Last Inspection</h1></center>
<h2>
Your Car Is A Comfortable Place to Be... Until... A Breakdown Places You In A
Precarious Situation</h2>
<address><i>By Donna Wagner, Director of Operations, Car Care Council, Port
Clinton, OH</i></address><P>
<i> </i>n days of old the worst thing a stalled motorist had to fear was not
being seen and getting hit.  Occasionally, in severe weather the driver of a
disabled car would become the victim of a fallen tree or overexposure.  But in
today's world, we're warned not to seek help on the road, nor are we to offer
it.  The smart thing to do is wait for the authorities.  Following that advice
still involves an often lengthy waiting period, leaving the stranded driver
terribly vulnerable.  Car Care Council's Donna Wagner says there's a better
way, and it starts with maintenance.<P>

"Most motorists break down due to one of five common causes," she says.  "They
are:  out of gas; the engine has stalled and won't start; a dead battery; a
flat tire or an overheating engine."<P>

"The encouraging aspect is that all of these difficulties are avoidable with
common sense and a little effort."<P>

Wagner suggests these preventive measures:
<ol>
<li>Periodic mechanical checkups, especially when engine stalling, hard
starting or other such symptoms are signaling trouble;
<li>Regular tire inspection to spot damage, unusual wear or underinflation that
can lead to tire failure;
<li>Seasonal checks and preventive maintenance of the cooling system, a
frequent factor in roadside breakdowns; 
<li>Pay close attention to the gas gauge.  Make it a habit to keep the tank
half full at all times.  This also safeguards against condensation in the tank.
If moisture in the gas line freezes, the engine can stall; and
<li>Consider investing in a CB radio or a cellular phone.</ol>If all else
fails, and you find yourself on the roadside, follow these tips:
<ul>
<li>Try to move the car out of traffic to a safe location.
<li>Turn on the emergency flashers.
<li>If at all possible, stay inside the car with the doors locked until help
arrives.
<li>Ask anyone who stops to offer aid to call for roadside assistance.</ul>To
help you prepare for winter, Car Care Council offers an informative pamphlet
entitled, ARE YOU SURE YOU AND YOUR CAR ARE READY FOR WINTER?  Providing
detailed preventive maintenance tips, the illustrated brochure includes a handy
36 point bumper-to-bumper check list plus suggestions for a blizzard emergency
kit.<P>

Council, Department W, One Grande Lake Drive, Port Clinton, OH  43452.<P>

Four Wheel Alignment</H1>
</center>"Alignment" can be a scary
word for motorists.<P>
The term, especially "four wheel alignment" conjures up visions of inscrutable
equipment and highly specialized automotive service.  Even drivers who
understand the term "tuneup" are often mystified by "alignment."  And the new
trend toward four wheel alignment can appear to be an expensive service for
which the unwary motorist seems to be paying extra.<P>
Don't reject out of hand the terms "alignment" or "four wheel alignment" the
next time a service technician recommends it to you, advises Perfect Circle, a
well-known supplier of aftermarket chassis, engine and sealing products.
Alignment is an important service that your car really needs from time to
time.<P>
Mike Jones, Perfect Circle Chassis Marketing Specialist, advises that alignment
is recommended for today's cars and light trucks in at least four situations:<P>
1. When you buy new tires.  "In fact," says Jones, "if your old tires wore
unevenly, bad alignment could be the reason they had to be replaced, and the
same thing could happen quickly to your brand-new tires!"<P>
2. When you have a rack &amp; pinion steering unit or certain other steering
parts in your car replaced, alignment is necessary;<P>
3. When certain warning signs appear on your car, indicating that alignment is
needed;<P>
4. Or about every 30,000 miles, whether warning signs appear or not.<FONT
SIZE=+2></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2></FONT><b>Just What Is An Alignment</b><P>
<b></b>"Basically, alignment is mak-    ing sure the wheels are operating
         parallel with one another, and that the tires meet the road at the
correct angle.  Wheel alignment is much simpler than most people think,"
explains Perfect Circle's Jones.  "It is simply adjusting the relationship
between the suspension and steering components, the wheels, and the frame of
the vehicle."<P>
"Carmakers recommend certain measurement specifications for each of these
angles on every one of their vehicles.  When the angles are all as specified,
the car or truck is properly aligned, and the best possible compromise has been
achieved among minimum rolling friction, maximum tire mileage, stability of the
car on the road, and steering control for the driver."<P>
"Everyday road shock and general wear and tear can knock some of these angles
out of spec.  When that happens, control of the vehicle may be threatened, and
the tires may begin to wear unevenly and rapidly.  The car needs to be
`realigned,' to have all the proper angles restored," Jones concluded.<b></b><P>
<b>Warning Signs Are Easy To Spot</b><P>
<b></b>The warning signs suggesting the need for alignment are easy to spot,
says Jones.  They include:
<ul>
<li><i>Unusual tire wear.</i>   Look closely at all four of your tires.  If one
or more of them demonstrate excessive wear on one side, or wear in a cupped,
scalloped or diagonal stripe pattern at edges or across the tread, or uneven
wear but with "feathered" edges on the treads, an alignment could be needed.
<li><i>Unusual steering feel.</i>  If the steering feels stiffer than it used
to, or if the wheel does not return to the center position when released, or if
the car feels skittish and like it is riding "on tip-toes", your wheels may be
out of alignment.
<li><i>If the steering wheel is cocked to one side</i>   when the front wheels
are pointing straight ahead, an alignment is almost certainly needed.
<li>While driving, if the car wants to <i>pull to one side, tends to</i>
<i>wander or weave,</i> or is subject to <i>front end "shimmy"</i>, you should
have the alignment checked immediately.
<li>Or if your car <i>wants to move "crab-like" </i>on the road, with the rear
end cocked off to one side while moving straight ahead, you're a top candidate
for <i>serious alignment.</i>
<li>There are three basic wheel angles which determine whether a vehicle is
properly aligned and goes where it is pointed.  Not every angle applies to
every wheel, and not all angles are adjustable on all cars, but the three
angles must be set properly for the alignment to be correct:
<li><i>Camber</i>  is simply the inward or outward tilt of a wheel compared to
a vertical line.  
<li><i>Caster</i>  is the degree that the car's steering axis is tilted forward
or backward from the vertical as viewed from the side of the car.  
<li><i>Toe</i> refers to the directions in which two wheels point relative to
each other.  "Toe-in" means the wheels point toward each other in a
"pigeon-toed" stance; toe-out means the wheels point away from each
other.</ul><i>Four-wheel alignment</i>  is the standard service today, and it
is essential on vehicles with front wheel drive (FWD) and independent rear
suspension.  The rear wheels should follow the fronts in a parallel path.  If
the rear wheels are pointed in a slightly different direction, they cause a
condition called "rear axle steer," which can affect tire wear and the
vehicle's stability.<P>
<b>What Happens During An Alignment?</b><P>
<b></b>Before an alignment, the technician will begin with a thorough
inspection of the entire undercar, including steering linkage, suspension
parts, wheels and tires, and the vehicle's frame and ride height.  He's looking
for parts that are loose, bent or near failure.<P>
Once this inspection is complete, your car will be driven onto the alignment
machine.  The technician will check and adjust, in order, camber, caster and
finally toe, beginning with the rear wheels.  (Remember, not all wheels are
adjustable on all vehicles.)  He may use regular wrenches and variety of
specialized tools and devices, manufactured by automotive suppliers such as
Perfect Circle, to make the necessary adjustments.  The tools can include:
<ul>
<li>Alignment shims, half-shims and wedges
<li>Eccentric bolts and cams
<li>Adjustable and non-adjustable bushings
<li>Offset control arm shafts.</ul><b>Some Vehicles Have Special Problems</b><P>
<b></b>Perfect Circle's Jones pinpointed several vehicles whose designs require
special alignment solutions.  Perfect Circle has created replacement parts that
address alignment challenges with these vehicles:<P>
1. <i>Ford Tempo and Taurus, Mercury Topaz and Sable, Lincoln Continental.</i>
These very popular FWD vehicles have a tendency late in life to develop rear
wheel misalignment, resulting in tire wear and handling difficulties.  Perfect
Circle has developed a line of eccentric camber/toe bushings, which service
dealers can insert in the suspension to adjust camber and toe and bring them
back to factory specifications.<P>
2. <i>GM "A" and "X" car, '88-89 GM 2WD and 4WD pickups, and early Chrysler "H"
and "P" cars.</i>  Again, replacement cam bolt kits allow alignment adjustments
to bring worn steering back to factory specs.<P>
<b>Future Alignment?</b><P>
<b></b>"We are entering an age of rapid change in suspension/steering design,
after many years without significant changes," observes Perfect Circle's
Jones.<P>
"The majority of cars sold in this country today are front wheel drive.  Most
of these cars are dependent on proper alignment at all four wheels to operate
safely and achieve acceptable tire wear.  Believe me, the cost of a four wheel
alignment is well worth it in vehicle handling alone.  And it could save you
several times its cost in reduced tire wear," Jones concluded.<P>

Shocks & Struts</H1>
</center>"If shock absorbers were like
air filters or tires, you wouldn't hesitate to inspect them," say automotive
engineers.  But a worn shock or strut, unlike a clogged filter or a flat tire,
won't disable the car.  But it can do worse, warns the Car Care Council.
Because of the loss of ride control, even one bad shock absorber can lead to an
accident.<P>
Shock absorbers and struts, part of the complex steering/suspension system,
usually wear gradually.  The vehicle owner may not realize how the ride or
handling characteristics have deteriorated until an emergency arises.<P>
Many owners, in fact, do not realize these components require periodic checking
and replacement.<P>
To increase car owner awareness, the Council answers five of the most commonly
asked questions about shock absorbers and struts.<P>
Q.  Will new shocks cure the weak springs on my car?<P>
A.  No.  Shock absorbers cannot replace springs.  Special load carrying or
booster shocks, however, can help support limited overload weight.<P>
Q.  Isn't the shock absorber's function to smooth out the ride?<P>
A.  That's only part of its job.  Shock absorbers (and/or struts) do a lot more
than that.  They improve handling by reducing from end drive when braking.
They also add to safety by controlling body sway and roll on turns even on
smooth highways. Good shocks also prevent wheel hop, which can lead to loss of
control.<P>
Q.  Don't the new gas-charged shocks and struts last longer because there is no
fluid to leak out?<P>
A.  Gas-charged shocks and struts do last longer than their predecessors, but
they still have fluid.  One purpose of the gas, usually nitrogen, is to prevent
aeration of the fluid which causes foaming.  Foaming of the fluid hinders shock
absorber performance.<P>
The gas charge also improves internal valving of the shock, improving both
stability and ride.<P>
NOTE:  When either shocks or struts are replaced, they should be replaced in
pairs for proper handling characteristics.<P>
Q.  Do I need to have the wheels re-aligned after having new shock absorbers
installed?<P>
A.  No.  But you'll probably need wheel alignment service if you've had new
struts installed.  That's because struts are an integral part of the suspension
system.<P>
Q.  Can I get my worn shocks repaired?<P>
A.  No.  These are sealed units which must be replaced.  Some struts, however,
can be rebuilt with a replacement cartridges, (essentially the shock absorber
component within the unit) which can be installed when the old on is worn
out.<P>

Undercar Inspection Is Part of Winter Preparation</H1>
</center>Fall is the season to prepare
for the wear and tear of Old Man Winter on your car.  When preparing for a long
season of driving on snow, water, ice and loose gravel, a lubrication and check
of your car's steering and suspension is a good precaution.  <P>
Water can get inside many steering and suspension parts, says Art Frank,
assistant director of training at the Moog Technical Training Center in St.
Louis, MO.  He explains, "That's the main reason for regular inspections and
lubrication; once water gets into a part such as a tie rod, the contamination
can create premature wear.  Keeping the parts lubricated and full of grease
reduces the possibility of contamination."<P>
This is also a good time to check on irregularities in the way a vehicle
handles, says Frank.  He points out, "A vehicle's chassis problems don't happen
overnight.  They take time to develop and surface.  Pay attention to how a
vehicle handles.  Does the steering feel loose?  Does the vehicle pull to
either side?  Does it shimmy or vibrate at certain speeds?  Does the ride seem
harsh when you hit a bump?"<P>
According to Frank, "When the vehicle is on the lubrication rack, a complete
undercar check-up can pin-point problems such as premature tire wear, splits in
the rubber bushings, or worn shocks and springs."<P>
Based on industry research, four out of every seven vehicles need repairs; 57%
of the vehicles in for a check-up need alignment.  Also, 31% of vehicles in for
repairs show ball joint wear and 20% of all vehicles brought in for alignment
need idler arm replacement.<P>
Looseness in the steering, coupled with excessive tire wear, may indicate the
need for steering linkage replacement, says Frank.  "Tight" steering, excessive
movement in any direction, or a popping or rubbing noise can be a sign of worn
upper strut mounts.  Ball joints also should be checked for looseness and
damage to their dust boots.<P>
An undercar inspection should include a check for looseness, off center or worn
bushings.  The combination of age, oil and heat -- particularly after a long,
hot summer -- can cause the rubber bushings to crack, distort and wear.
Bushings in such condition should be replaced.<P>
With cooler morning temperatures coming on, a vehicle may exhibit signs of
`morning sickness' in the form of sluggish steering.  "While this symptom
usually disappears as the engine warms up, it's a good warning sign that your
car's rack and pinion system could use a check up," explains Frank.<P>
Within the rack and pinion system's control valve are Teflon ring seals which
wear grooves in the aluminum housing over the course of driving.  When the seal
contracts in cold weather and pulls away from the grooved housing, a loss of
assist in steering can result.  The deeper the grooves, the longer the warm-up
period.  This problem is easier to detect in colder weather, but drivers should
be aware it can happen in any climate.<P>
Bellows boots used to keep contamination from rack and pinion systems, as well
as CV (constant velocity) joints on front-wheel drive vehicles, need to be
inspected for cracks, wear and deterioration before water, snow and ice become
a factor on the road.  <P>
"The accumulation of snow and ice around a CV boot can easily lead to a tear
and eventually damage the CV joint it should protect," says Frank.  "Replacing
the joint is expensive.  Replacement of a boot is far less expensive."<P>
A suspension inspection should include a check of springs, shock absorbers and
struts.  However, Frank emphasizes, "Contrary to the belief that shock
absorbers carry most of the weight of the vehicle, the springs are the primary
suspension parts that support the weight.  New shocks or struts will not fix a
weak spring problem."<P>
If new springs are needed, you have options: install replacements similar to
the originals, or install variable-rate springs.  Frank explains, "Variable
rate springs have an advantage in that they automatically increase their
resistance as weight or pressure is increased.  This results in a smooth,
comfortable ride when loaded or empty, and improve handling."<P>
Frank recommends inspecting and replacing springs at the same time shock
absorbers or struts are installed, if the need is found.<P>
Mileage, road conditions, weather and driving habits will all affect the
service life of alignment, component parts and tires.  A comprehensive
inspection of your car's steering and suspension systems in the fall might make
the difference in winter driving -- both in your pocketbook and in improve
driveability under hazardous road conditions.<P>

Worn Shocks Can "Sneak Up" On You</h1></center>
<P>

Have you ever noticed how quickly you can become accustomed to an annoying
shake or rattle?  You may forget it's there until the condition becomes
serious.  Worn shock absorbers or struts are a classic example of the kind of
deterioration that warrants early attention.  The first indication of pending
failure of these critical parts is when the vehicle dives when brakes are
applied, sways on turns or "bottoms out" on a bumpy road.<P>

A visual inspection under the car often discloses potential trouble, such as a
leaking or damaged shock or worn parts such as rubber bushings.<P>

The Car Care Council warns that weak shocks and/or struts lead to poor ride
control which affects more than comfort:  it's a safety factor as well.<P>

<center><h1>
Investigate The Causes of Tire Wear Problems</h1></center>
Tire wear patterns, such as scuffing, cupping and outside shoulder wear, often
are an indication of a larger problem with a vehicle's chassis components,
reports Terry Hawkins, alignment specialist and senior instructor with Moog
Automotive.<P>

"The cause of uneven tire wear can be as simple as under inflation or over
inflation," says Hawkins, "but it also can result from loose parts such as
shocks, struts, ball joints, steering linkage or from weak springs."  As a
precaution against tire failure -- the No. 1 cause of highway breakdowns --
Hawkins recommends checking tires regularly for the following conditions:<P>

<b>Shoulder wear,</b> which can be caused by under-inflation or hard cornering.
Many shredded rubber tires seen along highways are the result of either under
inflated tires, running too long and too hot, or from severe misalignment.<P>

<b>Center tread wear,</b> which usually indicates over-inflation.  Over
inflation results when a vehicle owner tries to compensate for a slow leak by
over inflating the tire to make it stay up longer.<P>

<b>Cupping</b> can be caused by an unbalanced tire condition, faulty wheel
bearings, loose parts, fatigued springs or weak shock absorbers.  Check the
condition of the shock by forcefully bouncing the front end of the car several
times and releasing it on the down stroke.  Failure of the vehicle to settle
after two strokes suggests worn shocks or struts.<P>

<b>Camber or toe wear</b> indicates misalignment due to loose, worn or bent
steering linkage components.  Many camber and toe wear problems can be traced
to spring fatigue, which causes the vehicle's frame to ride closer to the road.
Once the vehicle is below the manufacturer's height specifications, it is not
possible to achieve the correct camber change designed into the suspension
without replacing the springs.  The vehicle also experiences excessive toe
change as the suspension travels through jounce and rebound, again causing
abnormal tire wear.<P>

<b>Diagonal scuffing and cupping</b> across the face on rear tires signals
problems with toe.  Diagonal tread wear or cupping on rear tires is caused when
the direction  the vehicle's wheels are heading is not in line with the
geometric center line of the vehicle.  When this condition occurs, front-wheel
steering can be affected and lead to tire slip or loss of traction or control.
(Note:  The wear pattern that develops on rear tires from improper toe will
vary depending on tread design. Wear patterns from rear-wheel misalignment may
resemble cupping on tires with highway tread design and diagonal scuffing on
tires with an all season tread pattern.)
<h3>
Early detection is key</h3>
"Once a particular wear pattern develops," says Hawkins, "it will continue for
the life of the tire."  New tires will not correct a wear pattern problem and
will soon begin to wear unevenly or prematurely if the cause of the problem is
not repaired.<P>

"In the classroom, I ask my students, `When was the last time you replaced a
set of tires that were worn evenly all the way down to the bottom of the
tread?'  You don't see that.  Tires are commonly worn in patches or along their
edges due to misalignment, or loose chassis parts."<P>

In order to achieve optimum tire performance, vehicle owners should follow a
preventive maintenance schedule that includes frequent checks of tire pressure
and rotation of tires every 6,000 to 7,500 miles.<P>

"Every car owner should have a tire gauge to monitor tire pressure once a month
or whenever they check their oil," says Al Lynch, manager of technical services
for Moog.  "Tire pressure should conform with the manufacturer's
recommendations, found inside the passenger door, door jamb, or glove box, to
accommodate the rated vehicle load." <P>

Tire wear patterns often are easier to feel than to see, adds Lynch.  "Before
feeling the tire," he cautions, "make sure there are no pieces of steel belting
or metal embedded in the rubber which could result in a cut or splinter.  Also
make sure the vehicle is turned off and the parking brake is engaged.<P>

"As you check each tire, be sure to feel both side to side and up and down the
tread.  If the tread pattern on the outside of the tires feels worn, either a
camber or toe problem may exist which means it is time to have the wheel
alignment checked by a qualified technician.  <P>

Scrap Tires</H1>
</center>When you buy a tire or
battery you're likely to pay a surcharge that goes to the Solid Waste
Management Fund.  It's part of the solution to the solid waste problems facing
our nation, a condition to which millions of junk tires annually make their
contribution.<P>
The good news is that used tires are a valuable resource; they just need proper
storage and handling.  They can be used in asphalt paving, as a supplementary
fuel in many industries and as a raw material in molded plastic and rubber
products.<P>
The bad news:  tens of thousands of tires land in the junk pile before their
normal life expectancy, says the Car Care Council.  Due to motorists' poor
maintenance habits, they're damaged and/or wear unevenly, requiring replacement
before their normal "retirement" time.<P>
Storage of waste tires is a challenge to tire recyclers.  In addition to
littering our landscapes they present a fire hazard and, because they provide a
breeding place for insects and rodents, a health hazard as well.<P>
With periodic wheel alignment and balancing, along with monthly checks of tire
inflation, tires will last 10% - 20% longer, says the Car Care Council.  That
means fewer scrap tires to dispose of; real savings to vehicle owners.<P>

Space Saving Spare Tire May Harbor Unpleasant Surprise</h1></center>
<address><i>By Donna Wagner, Director of Operations, Car Care Council, Port
Clinton, OH</i></address><P>
KA-BOOM!  THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.  Your car has a flat tire but there's no need to
worry.  Those compact spares are much easier to maneuver than the old fashioned
ones.  In fifteen minutes you, or some good Samaritan, are finished and back on
the highway.  But before reaching the next exit, pieces of your spare tire are
flying over the interstate.<P>

A functional spare is a comforting accessory, but an underinflated or dry
rotted one is worthless.  One that is buried under tons of trunk trash is
useless, too.  By avoiding the following pitfalls, you can be assured that your
baby tire is as capable as his big brothers.<P>

UNDERINFLATION  Underinflation is the culprit in most bad spare scenarios.  If
your spare is low, it may shred on the way home or to the service facility.
The distance you can travel before this happens is directly related to the
tire's inflation level.  Check the pressure of the spare, as well as the other
four tires every month or two.<P>

DRY ROTTING  Tires, like clothing, tend to deteriorate with age.  Although this
problem is not as common as underinflation, it bears consideration.  Tires do
have a shelf life.  After a period of time, they may begin to develop small
cracks in the sidewall, your first clue to this condition.<P>

INACCESSIBILITY  The leading reason spare tires fall victim to underinflation
and dry rotting is inaccessibility. If you do your own vehicle maintenance,
clear out the trunk and check that "Mickey Mouse" tire.  If you take your car
to a shop, most automotive technicians are happy to check your spare if they
can get to it. However, few will move your cargo for the sake of your spare.<P>

FINAL NOTES  1)  Some space saving spares are made to travel up to 3,000 miles
at highway speeds; most are limited to 50 m.p.h.  It is, as car makers state,
for temporary use.  Replace it with a full-size tire as soon as possible.  2)
Keep your compact spare and its wheel together and do not use them on another
car.  3)  Do not use tire chains on the space saving spare.  They won't fit and
will damage the car as well as the chains.  4)  Don't even think about driving
through a car wash that pulls the car along guide rails. The spare can get
caught on the rail and damage the tire, wheel and possibly other parts of your
car as well.  <P>

Remember:  a flat tire in the trunk is about as useful as a flashlight without
batteries.<P>

TLC For Tires</H1>
</center>Each year Americans spend
millions of dollars on the purchase of tires.  Unfortunately, they don't spend
very much time taking care of them.<P>
What most people don't realize is that tires add value to their cars when
properly cared for.  And proper tire maintenance involves very simple, routine
tasks that can save consumers both money and headaches.<P>
"Tires are some of the most important parts of a car, helping a car perform to
its maximum capabilities," said Stan Cooper, Firestone's marketing manager for
consumer products.  "On the other hand, they're also some of the most
overlooked components of a car.  By giving them a little attention every month,
consumers can enhance the performance of their cars and make their tires last a
lot longer.<P>
So what can you do to provide your tires a little TLC?  The first step in
caring for your tires is keeping them properly inflated.  The single greatest
cause of tire damage is improper inflation -- which results in early and
irregular wear and also decreases your car's gas mileage.<P>
Your car owner's manual will have the correct tire pressure for your tires.
Investing in your own air pressure gauge is money well spent.  Gauges are easy
to use; your tire dealer can show you how.  Firestone recommends that you check
the air pressure in your tires at least once a month and perform visual checks
regularly to detect possible leaks.<P>
By having your car's alignment checked, you ensure that your wheels are moving
in a straight line when you steer straight, therefore cutting down on irregular
tread wear.  Misalignment can result in tire damage as well as damage to our
car's suspension system.  And that can be costly.<P>
Have your alignment checked about every 10,000 miles or at least once a year.
You'll probably want to call ahead to make an appointment with your tire dealer
for this job, which usually takes less than an hour.<P>
Balancing your tires is also very important.  When your tires aren't balanced
correctly, your car will behave a lot like the way your washing machine does
when the clothes clump in one spot during the spin cycle.  The washer rocks
wildly from the uneven weight distribution.  When your tire and wheel
assemblies aren't balanced, you'll get an uncomfortable ride, the steering
wheel will vibrate, and you'll do damage to your tires and your suspension
system as your tires bounce against the pavement.<P>
Protect your investment in your tires by checking inflation and tread depth
each month and by visiting your tire dealer for rotation, alignment and
balancing when necessary.  You'll extend the life of your tires, enhance your
car's performance and improve your car's fuel efficiency.<P>

Easy Does It With The Spin</H1>
</center>Some drivers have the idea
that if they can't get off ice or out of the rut by spinning their wheels at
half speed, they just might be able to scare the car out by gunning the engine.
Then it's "SCREECH" as the spinning tire digs and melts its way through to hard
surface.  Then it's "SNAP - CLUNK" as something breaks.  With the torque of the
engine suddenly applied against drive line components, something has to go.<P>
That's more than the universal joints or CV joints, in a front wheel drive car,
were designed to handle.  These flexible joints that transmit power from the
engine to the wheels twist as much as 29 million times in ten thousand miles.
When they become worn a little, extra slack can be just enough to allow a
sudden jerk to cause a break.  And if you've been the heavy-footed "jerk" you
may pay a hefty repair bill, warns the Car Care Council.<P>
The spinning wheel, incidentally, turns at double the speed shown on your
speedometer, enough to cause a tire to fly apart.  To protect your tires, your
driveline components and your automatic transmission, take it easy when you try
to "rock" your car out of a snow bank.<P>

How To Avoid Being Stuck In "Park"</h1></center>
Have you ever wondered why you had so much trouble shifting out of PARK on a
steep grade? An automatic transmission, when in PARK position, locks the
driving wheels. On a steep grade you'll need more than normal pressure to move
the shift lever. This is because the transmission's parking pawl resists the
vehicle's tendency to roll.<P>

To help a stuck shift lever, on a very steep grade, the vehicle will need an
uphill push or pull, thereby releasing pressure on the transmission.<P>

The Car Care Council suggests a simple procedure to prevent being jammed in
PARK on a grade:
<ol>
<li>Do not put it in PARK until, with foot brake applied, you've secured the
parking (emergency) brake.
<li>Before releasing the parking brake, apply the foot brake and move the shift
lever to NEUTRAL or DRIVE.</ol>

Three Senses Help Spot Car Trouble</H1>
</center>One of the most agonizing
noises a car owner may ever hear is the scraping or grinding sound of an
automatic transmission that's low on oil.  Even in a well insulated car, the
metal-to-metal sound is awesome.<P>
According to the Car Care Council, at the first indication of such a noise, the
transmission fluid should be checked.  If the level is low, adding fluid may
correct the trouble.<P>
If the noise persists, the culprit could be a clogged transmission filter which
is preventing fluid from reaching the pump.  The result, the transmission is
starved of fluid, with eventual destruction of the pump and other components.
This can add up to a very large repair bill.<P>
The above mentioned horror story should never happen, says Car Care Council, if
automatic transmission fluid is checked regularly (at least as often as the oil
is changed) and if fluid and filter are replaced periodically.<P>
The Council recommends checking fluid only when the vehicle has been run for a
few miles after the engine has reached normal operating temperature.<P>
Check to see if it is discolored, rather than pink or red, which is normal.
When fluid has turned brown, this is an indication that it has been burned.
Note also if it smells burned.  Burned fluid should be drained and replaced,
along with the filter.<P>
The Council also notes that the tip of the dip stick should be cool enough to
touch; an automatic transmission should operate at 150-200deg.F.  Severe
service driving, which can overheat the transmission, may call for the addition
of a transmission cooler.  Fluid life is greatly extended when it is kept
within normal operating temperature.<P>
Most types of "severe" service driving require most frequent fluid and filter
changes, as well as other periodic services.<P>
This type of service is described as follows:
<ul>
<li>Frequent idling for long periods of time, such as stop-and-go driving in
heavy traffic.
<li>Sustained highway driving in hot weather.
<li>Towing a boat or trailer, or carrying heavy objects on a rooftop rack.
<li>Driving in dusty conditions.
<li>Prolonged operation at sub-zero temperatures.
<li>Driving on steep hills or mountains on a regular basis.</ul>Preventive
maintenance is critical to long, efficient car life, summarized Car Care
Council.  When it is neglected one's senses of sight, sound and smell may
signal trouble.<P>

"Mama Always Said:  Life Is Like..."</h1></center>
<h2>
...Buying a Used Car"</h2>
Forrest Gump's mama's line, "life is like a box of chocolates; you never know
what you're going to get," could apply to used car shoppers. Unless you poke
through the bottom of the candy, you may wind up with a yucky cream instead of
a delicious caramel.<P>

Most teenagers' dream of a used car that's not too pricey, runs well and looks
sharp, with an emphasis on "sharp". Unfortunately, these three characteristics
are not always found in the same vehicle. That means it's your job to "poke
through the candy" and find out what's inside.<P>

If your car knowledge is limited, find a mechanic or friend who is wise in the
ways of vehicles. Ask or pay him/her to accompany you to the car lot. Have
these key items checked before you plunk down your life savings.<P>

<b>FLUIDS</b> - Most cars have over ten fluids. The important ones to check are
the engine coolant, oil, transmission, power-steering, and brake fluids.
Contaminants or low fluids can be your clue that the car has been poorly
maintained.<P>

<b>ACCIDENT ALERT</b> - Problems in the following areas may indicate a previous
accident:  bent or welded frame; doors, hood and trunk that have gaps or do not
close properly; paint color is not uniform; ripples in the metal. You'll have
to get it on a lift for a full inspection, but it's worth the trouble.<P>

<b>STEERING AND SUSPENSION</b> - Too much play in the steering may mean worn
parts; that's bad and usually expensive news. A car's suspension system refers
to its  shocks and/or struts. If this system (aptly named because it literally
"suspends" your car over its four tires) is in bad shape, you could lose the
ability to steer over rough terrain, making your ride dangerous and bumpy. Your
car expert friend will use the "bounce test" to check it out.<P>

<b>EXHAUST</b> - That hot-rod noise may sound cool, but it could mean a leak in
one of several places. If this leak is in the catalytic converter, you could
possibly fail a motor-vehicle inspection.<P>

<b>BELTS AND HOSES</b> - Worn belts and hoses can be good indicators of how the
previous owner(s) maintained the car. If these items are in bad shape,
beware.<P>

<b>ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION</b> - Because the engine powers the car and the
transmission "transmits" this power to the wheels, these two systems are
important players. Check them both visually and with a test drive. The car
should run quietly and smoothly. If it is a manual, the gears should shift
easily.<P>

<b>BRAKES</b> - While your dream car is up on the lift, make sure the brake
system is examined. This involves removing a couple of wheels. Look at the
pads, shoes, rotors, drums and hydraulic parts.<P>

<b>TIRES </b>- Check the tread on all five (the spare makes five) tires. Worn
treads mean you'll soon be investing in new tires. Treads that have worn
unevenly indicate poor alignment.<P>

Resist the urge to follow your heart with your wallet until you know the car
inside and out. As time goes by you'll be glad you "poked your finger through
the chocolate" and found out what was in the center.<P>

Three Tips For Buying A Better Used Car</h1></center>
The Car Care Council has three tips for newcomers to the world of used car
buying.<P>

<b>First, do your homework. </b>Read consumer magazines and price guides. This
will help you decide what features you want, what specific cars fit your needs
and what price range to expect.<P>

<b>Second, use an evaluation sheet to keep track of the cars you check out.</b>
Jot down what your inspection of each auto reveals. It will come in handy when
comparing the pros and cons. <P>

<b>Finally, never, ever buy a used car (or a new one either) on impulse.</b>
There are many places to shop for a used car, don't just stop at the first one.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Body</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
<P>
The body shell is a fairly complex assortment of large steel sections. These sections have been stamped into specific shapes which make up the body of your car. These parts are designed to do many jobs at once; protect the occupants from the elements and in collisions, provide solid mounts for all other systems, and to slice through the air with minimal resistance. The body also has one other job which is usually important to the owner... it has to look good!  
<P>
Although the zillions of parts that make up a car are all very important, it is also important that the car's body be able to make riding in a car bearable for you. Early cars were so uncomfortable to ride in, that the human body could stand it only for short periods of time. Auto bodies have come a long way since then. The body and the suspension system now give us a smooth ride, and cushion us from the jarring of the road. The idea is that the body of the car should go forward with as little up-and-down, and side-to-side movement as possible.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Frame (Chassis)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The frame provides a firm structure for the body, as well a good anchor point for the suspension system. There are two types of frames; integral frames (you've probably heard of them as "unibody") and conventional frames.  
<P>
A conventional frame is basically a "one-piece" frame, or two "one-piece" frames fastened together.  The frame is extremely rigid in order to keep all the other parts of the car in perfect alignment. The manufacturer takes this type of frame and attaches all the other parts of the car to it, like the way a sculptor starts with a wire frame to build his sculpture on and give it shape.  To keep things smooth, rubber insulator blocks, or "pads" are placed between the frame and the other car parts.  Because the conventional frame is so important to the structure of your car, (without it, your car would be a pile of doors, hoses, seats, wires and metal) it is usually constructed of heavy steel and welded or cold riveted together. Cold riveting keeps the rivets from shrinking after they cool off.  
<P>
The integral, or unibody, frame is just the opposite. With this type of frame, the body parts are used to structurally strengthen the entire car, and all of the sections are welded into one piece. Sometimes the parts of the body and the suspension system are attached and reinforced. Also, some unibody frames have partial front and rear frames for attaching the engine and suspension members. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Crash/Safety Features</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
What actually happens in a collision? The first part of that answer is that there are two collisions. The first collision occurs when the vehicle runs into another object. The second collision is when the occupant(s) hit the inside of the car. Neither a seat belt nor an air bag can do anything about the first collision, but they can be a great help to you in the second collision. They can minimize the impact between you and the interior of the car.   
<P>
Safety belt use is more than a personal right. Injuries and fatalities resulting from motor vehicle accidents are reflected in the rising costs of auto and health insurance, and costs to employers in the form of lost days at work. The taxpayer also loses by having to support emergency medical response teams and social programs for the disabled.

<P><B>Excuses, excuses!</B> 

<OL>					
	<LI>"Seat belts are too uncomfortable."<BR>
	Of course, in a car accident -- without your seat belt -- you would smash into the steering column, slam into the dashboard, or crash through the windshield. This too, can be very uncomfortable.
	<LI>"Seat belts wrinkle my clothes."<BR>
	Sometimes. Sitting also wrinkles clothes. Wearing clothes wrinkles clothes. Flying through a windshield REALLY wrinkles clothes.  
	<LI>"Only nerds wear seat belts."<BR>
	Really? It turns out that -- without seat belts -- nerds, jocks, cheerleaders, "A" students and average students would all fly through the windshield at the same rate.  
	<LI>"I'm a good driver."<BR>
	Nice as that is, good drivers can get hit by bad drivers, drunk drivers, or other good drivers with mechanical failures. Very few people intend to have accidents.  
	<LI>"Seat belts restrict my freedom of movement."<BR>
	This is true. Without your seat belt, you have all the freedom in the world--to crash into your windshield, to slam into your car's interior, or to be thrown from your car and slide along the pavement. Freedom is great.
	<LI>"It's too embarrassing to ask friends to use their seat belts."  
</OL> 

<P>
In 1984, 46,000 people died in car accidents. That same year, not one person died of embarrassment.  
<P>
Safety in car design was recognized as being important even in the earliest cars. In recent years, however, it has become a fundamental subject in its own right. Active safety measures have been designed to reduce the likelihood of a car being involved in an accident in the first place, while passive safety measures assume that a collision is inevitable and then aim to reduce the severity of the injuries to the road users involved.
<P>
Until the late 1800's the British had a 2 mph speed limit for cars. There was an excellent reason for this. It was also required, for safety's sake, that each car carry two passengers with a third person walking in front. The job of the third person was to walk in front of the car to warn everyone that it was coming!
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Seat Belts and Air Bags </B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The first federal study of automobile air bags in actual traffic accidents has found that air bags used in conjunction with seat belts are far more effective than seat belts alone. Air bags reduce the risk of death in head-on collisions by 26% and in all serious accidents by 13%.  
<P>
Contrasting earlier findings that did not involve actual road conditions, the study showed that air bags protected occupants in ways that seat belts alone, did not. The air bag spread out the violent impact of a crash and kept occupants from smashing against the steering wheel, dashboard or windshield.  
<P>
Having an air bag and wearing an effective seat belt offers the best protection of all. Not only are you protected from frontal crashes by the air bag -- you are also protected by the seat belt in all other types of crashes.  
<P>
Studies show that 60% of the people killed or injured in automobile accidents would have been saved from serious injury by safety belts. Unfortunately, many people choose not to wear them.  
<P>
With an "effective" safety belt (one that is worn and operating correctly), your body will stop, in a crash, before you have a chance to hit or go through the windshield and parts of your car.
<P>
Seat belts are especially important in small cars, because your chances of being killed or badly hurt in a collision with a big car is eight times greater. Wearing your belt will greatly improve your chances of survival.
<P>
In a Department of Transportation study made public on June 26, 1992, it was announced that air bags are far more effective than seat belts alone. Air bags can reduce the risk of death in a head-on collision by 26% and in all serious accidents by 13%. However, the DOT cautioned that air bags work this well ONLY when occupants were wearing a properly buckled seat belt over lap and shoulder. Other studies have shown that WITHOUT A BELT, AIR BAGS ARE OF SLIGHT BENEFIT.  
<P>
Air bags are only useful in frontal crashes, so it is not a good idea to skip your seat belt because you have an air bag. Air bags provide very effective protection in frontal crashes, inflating instantly to protect the driver or passenger that has a air bag. They spread the impact of the crash over the individual's head and chest and protect fragile body parts from the car's hard surfaces.
<P>
More than 6 million cars (about 4% of cars on the road today) have air bags, but the majority of them have air bags on the driver's side only. Federal officials estimate that air bags have inflated in more than 57,000 accidents since they were introduced, six years prior to 1992, and saved about 300 lives.
<P>
This report came out in the middle of the most sweeping safety overhaul since the introduction of the seat belt almost 30 years ago. For the first time, most new cars sold in the US in 1992 have driver's side airbags. Within 6 years, federal law will require that every new car, light truck and van have air bags on both sides.  
<P>
The main concern of car safety research in the last few years has been the development of passive safety design features, where the aim is to improve the "crash-worthiness" of vehicles. The fundamental aim of good passive safety design is to ensure that only tolerable loads are applied to a car occupant's body during a crash. This is done first by restraining the occupant within the passenger compartment by means of a seat belt or other device, so that chances of making contact with the interior parts of the car are reduced. Secondly, when contacts cannot be avoided, the structures which are likely to be hit by the occupants must be designed to collapse and cushion them. 
<P>
It is important for the designers to have some knowledge of the forces that the human body can withstand, but as yet this branch of biomechanics has not been fully researched. Work is done at low impact energy levels using volunteers, but for high speed crashes it is necessary to use dummies. 
<P>
The relationship between dummy performance and that of a real person in a crash is complex, and it may be that these differences are very considerable. To reduce this problem, some work is currently being done using human cadavers. 
<P>
In spite of the difficulties in this area, many basic improvements have been introduced into cars in recent years. These include anti-burst door latches, safety glass, energy-absorbing steering wheels and columns, head restraints and various seat belt systems.
<P>
The benefits of the three-point seat belts have been firmly established: over 50% of fatal and serious injuries to car occupants would be avoided if all occupants wore their seat belts. Most states now have a law that both passengers and driver must have seat belts buckled while in motion. Those states which do not enforce a seat belt law for all passengers have an effective law for children under five years of age to be strapped in.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Rust Prevention</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Rust is very bad for your car. It will also depreciate the value of your car more than any other problem. It is the most difficult and expensive problem to fix.
<P>
The best way to protect your car against rust is to keep the body clean and check it regularly. If you see a light brown stain, don't ignore it, have it fixed before it gets worse. Although most rust problems can be repaired, if it involves chrome parts, you will need to replace them.
<P>
The major cause of rust is salt on the roads. The salt carries moisture into every nook and cranny of your car. Rising temperatures bring on salt-caused oxidation. This makes the salt already in your car worse in the spring. Heat in your garage will also bring out the worst in the salt. Acid rain is also bad for your car's body; it ruins the paint that protects the metal of the body.  
<P>
Undercoating is not rustproofing. Its job is to deaden sound. If any salt or moisture gets into the undercoating, it aids in the rusting process.  <BR> <BR> 
<P>

<B>To prevent rust:</B>  
<OL>
	<LI>Keep your car clean and well waxed.  
	<LI>Rinse the underside with water when salt is in use or if you live in a salty area.  
	<LI>Keep your wheel wells clean and free from material that holds moisture, such as dirt or leaves.  
	<LI>Make sure that all drain holes in the frame, floor and bottoms of doors are clear.  
	<LI>After you wash your car, open the doors to let the water drain out.
</OL>

<P>
Rust proofing is a treatment of waxy paste sprayed inside the body panels by an "after market" specialist. The specialist drills holes in hidden areas, sprays in the paste, and plugs the holes. Another type of rustproofing is a clear silicon-based spray that is applied to your paint to protect it from chemicals and pollution. Modern cars come with good built-in corrosion protection and warranties against corrosion. You might wind up sealing in the corrosives you are trying to protect against. Also, many car manufacturers void your corrosion warranty if you have your car rustproofed. The best course is to take the rust preventative measures listed above.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Door Locks</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Door locks must keep the door from opening in a crash situation and resist break-ins, but it should also be possible to open them if you lose the key. The door handle acts as a lever that pulls on a rod. The rod rotates the door latch. The various types of lock mechanisms interrupt the action of the door latch. The "striker" is a mechanism attached to the door post, or part of the car body. It holds the door shut or allows it to be opened when the door handle rotates the latch. The striker's job is to keep the door closed under normal conditions, or to hold the door closed if the door post starts to bend away from the door in a crash.  
<P>
Power door lock mechanisms are operated by electric solenoids. Anti-burst door locks are a relatively cheap development, that have proven to be one of the most successful but unrecognized benefits of crash protective design. 
<P>
Studies have shown that it is much better to remain in a car than to be thrown out, because if a person is thrown out, serious injury may result from contact with the road surface, and there is a great risk of being run over by one's own or another vehicle. It is, therefore, important that the doors should stay shut during a collision, and the design of a latch to do this has been perfected and introduced into almost all cars in the world. 
<P>
An anti-burst latch provides resistance to tension forces of up to 3000 lb. (1360 kg) in all directions, by having a lock striker on the door which completely encircles a ring or plate mounted on the door frame. The system is designed so that it resists the forces generated in a collision both by the occupant striking the door on the inside and by the force of the impact on the outside. The result is that ejection, which was established as a leading cause of death to car occupants in 1956, has now been reduced until it has relatively little importance.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Window Winding Mechanisms</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
There are two types of window winding mechanisms; hand cranked and power.
<P>
Hand cranks work two ways. With "window winders," the crank turns a "sector gear" that pivots a pair of arms. The arms raise the "window carrier" and the glass. Some cars have fixed glazing in the rear doors so that the window cannot go up or down. The other type of window crank is a tape mechanism. It winds up a ladder-like tape made of plastic links. The plastic links are wound on to or off a spool to raise or lower the glass. The tape mechanism was introduced in 1980 GM cars. It saves weight and space. Its parts will not corrode when rainwater gets into the door, and it needs no lubrication.
<P>
First introduced in 1946, power windows use a small electric motor inside the door. The motor turns the crank that raises the window.
<P>
Door and vent windows are made of laminated "safety" plate glass, which is a sandwich of glass and clear plastic. The plastic acts as a soft, protective barrier, keeping the glass in place, if it is struck during a collision.  The glass sticks to the plastic even when shattered.

<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Side Beam</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The door's inner panel has crossbars, or heavy metal beams to provide strength to the door, and to protect the passenger from injury in the event of a collision.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Door</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
A door consists of an inner and an outer panel. The inner panel provides strength. The outer panel is just a metal cover, or "skin." The inner panel has a variety of holes and stems for the attachment to the window mechanisms and locks. The upper part of the door is the window glass that rides in grooves on two sides of the door frame.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Door Hinges</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The door hinge is a jointed, flexible device on which the door opens and closes. Its foundation is the center body pillar. The door is attached to the center body pillar by the hinge.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Seats</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
There are basically two types of seats; bench seats or bucket seats.  
<P>
A bucket seat is a low, separate seat for one person. Although we think of them as relatively new, it is interesting to note that in 1905 Henry Ford's first model A had bucket seats.
<P>
Bench seats are a continuous cushion and backrest across the width of the car (although some vans might have them running along the length of the van). Bucket seats are single units with a separation between the left and right seats.
<P>
Usually vinyl leather and fabric are used for upholstery. "Flatsprings" are used for comfort. A flatspring is a piece of wire that is bent into a zigzag pattern. Both ends of the wire are attached to the seat frame, with additional lengths added every six inches. Foam padding is used to cover the flatsprings.
<P>
The front seats ride on rails that are bolted to the floor. This arrangement allows the seats to move backwards and forwards to suit the driver or passenger. The seat adjustment lever is attached to a latch that fits into teeth along the rail. Moving the lever releases the seat, and allows the seat to move. At any point of the seat's movement, releasing the lever engages the latch with one of the teeth. Usually there is also a pull-spring; this draws the seat forward when the latch is released.  
<P>
The rear seat usually doesn't move, because it is secured to the floor of the car. It's backrest is attached to the partition between the passenger compartment and trunk.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Door Handle</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The door handle is used to open the door, and as a way to release the door latch. It mates with a toothed wheel at the side panel of the door, called a rotor. When the door is closed, one of the teeth contacts the striker and causes the rotor to turn one tooth. If the door is completely closed, the rotor engages with the striker. The door can't open because the rotor is locked. When you unlock the door, the rotor can rotate and the door opens.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Windshield</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Up until 1935 many cars had hinged windshields that could be folded on the hood of the car or opened up. Today, most windshields are stationary. They are fixed in place with a weather-strip made of rubber. The strip has a groove on the inside and a groove on the outside. The inside groove holds the glass; the outside groove holds the metal rim of the windshield opening in place. The glass "floats" in a plastic sealant that is spread out between the edge of the glass and the frame of the windshield.
<P>
Windshields are made of laminated safety plate glass, which is a sandwich of glass and clear plastic. The plastic acts as a soft, protective barrier, keeping the glass in place, if it is struck during a collision. The glass sticks to the plastic to eliminate glass from flying around the interior and injuring someone.  
<P>
Safety glass for windscreens was one of the first passive safety devices introduced into cars in the 1930s, but its use remains a controversial question. North America and Scandinavia favor a laminated glass, which consists of two sheets of annealed glass, separated by a layer of transparent plastic. The rest of Europe and Japan favor toughened glass because it is cheaper. This type is a single sheet of glass which is heat strengthened, and which on impact fractures into small cubic fragments without very sharp edges. In recent years, laminated glass has been improved by changes in the properties of the plastic interlayer. Research has demonstrated that this new laminated glass is about 4 times safer than toughened glass, but because it is more expensive, controversy continues as to whether or not toughened glass windscreens should be banned by legislative action and replaced by laminated glass. 
<P>
Recent developments have combined the benefits of both laminated and toughened material in that a laminated construction is used, but the sheet next to the inside of the car is made of toughened glass.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Spoiler</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
A spoiler is a kind of wing that is mounted on the rear of the car in a horizontal position. Its function is to provide high speed stability. For most cars, the spoiler is purely cosmetic; a car has to be going over 100 mph to take advantage of the aerodynamics of the spoiler.
<P>
Some mini-vans also make use of a spoiler, but it's upside down, and angled. The purpose of this type of spoiler is simply to keep the rain off the rear window.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Air Dam</B></FONT></CENTER> 

                               
<P>
An air dam is a projection of the body shell underneath the front of the chassis. Its function is to reduce the amount of air turbulence and drag underneath the car, and to channel air to the radiator.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Floor Pan</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The floor pan is at the bottom of the car assembly. This is the foundation of the body shell. The floor pan is stamped with bulges and curves to accommodate the spatial requirements of the engine, transmission and rear axle, as well as the passenger compartment. A second floor pan is often used for the trunk of the car. If the car has a separate frame, the floor pan is bolted to the side rails buffered by large rubber cushions. With unibody construction, the floor pan is attached to the several metal pieces that make up the chassis center section.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Firewall and "A" Pillars</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The firewall separates the passenger and engine sections of the car. It's a flat piece of steel stamped with curves and punched with holes and openings for wires, tubes, and levers that extend into the passenger compartment. It goes up both sides of the dashboard and stops where it meets the roof panel. These pillars formed by the firewall provide the frame for the windshield and are called "A" pillars.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Rear Quarter Panel</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The rear quarter panel is the body skin, or sheet metal, that runs from the rearmost part of the rear door edge, around the back and to the rear door on the other side of the car. On many cars, the rear quarter panels are integral with the roof. 
<P>
The rear quarter panel is composed of an outer skin and inner panels. The inner panels are reinforcements for the rear of the passenger compartment, the trunk, and the wheel housings. Without the inner panels, there would be severe vibration and weak construction in the back of the car.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Bumpers</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Bumpers are made of heavy sheet metal and are mounted on the front and rear of the car. Bumpers are bent and formed into specific shapes in order to absorb and deliver momentum during a collision. In the event of a collision, the bumper absorbs some of the impact, which decreases damage to the car and its occupants. It also protects the front of the car by diverting all of the car's momentum to the object with which it has collided.
<P>
The bumper is mounted to the car's chassis with special impact absorbers. These shock absorbers are often spring loaded. In slow speed collisions, this allows the bumper to compress, and then extend back to its original position.   
<P>
All bumpers are designed to absorb the energy of the impact. They do this through a series of valves and air chambers. Some car bumpers have hydraulic chambers. In the event of a collision, the absorption unit allows air and/or hydraulic fluid to pass through small openings. Forcing the air/fluid through the valve openings absorbs the energy from the collision.  
<P>
The bumper's job is to minimize damage, primarily to the occupants of the vehicle and to the vehicle itself. US law requires cars to pass special crash tests at various speeds. In order to pass, the car's damage level during the crash must be below a specific dollar level. This protects the consumer and is also very important for keeping the cost of automobile insurance to a minimum.
<P>
Sometimes bumpers are constructed with built-in "crumple zones." Crumple zones are designed to absorb impact; they will flex on impact. As the metal flexes, the action of the bending metal converts the kinetic energy of the car into heat. Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses while it is in motion.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Hood</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The car's hood is another type of door. It also consists of an inner and an outer panel. The inner panel provides strength. The outer panel is just a metal cover, or "skin". The underside of the hood is often covered with a sound-absorbing material. Some high performance cars have openings in the hood to allow the engine to "breathe" easier. "Hood scoops" are used to channel outside air directly to the air filter, which gives improved performance and efficiency.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Trunk Lid</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The trunk lid is another type of door. It consists of an inner and an outer panel. The inner panel provides strength. The outer panel is just a metal cover, or "skin".
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Radiator Grille</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The radiator grille is the part of the body shell on the front of your car that covers the area where the air enters. The radiator grille can also be part of the bumper on some cars.
<P>
The radiator is connected to the shroud for the radiator. The shroud directs the air that comes in through the radiator grille to the radiator only. This prevents the air from escaping around the radiator and failing to cool the engine. 
<P>
On newer cars, the radiator grille has been lowered to take advantage of lower hood lines, brought about by an effort to increase fuel efficiency. Older cars had massive grilles, whereas the cars now produced have smaller more aerodynamic grilles.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Driver's Side Mirror</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The driver's side mirror is connected to the driver's side of the car's body. This mirror is a very important device, not for adjusting your make-up. It enables you, with a slight glance of the eye, to see places that you can't otherwise see without taking your eyes off the road. 
<P>
The mirror is adjusted by the driver to suit the necessary visibility position (position of the head). Sometimes the mirror must be manually adjusted outside the car.  <P>The mirror is also often controlled from the inside of car by a series of cables. The cables are connected to a "joystick" that allows you to tilt the mirror manually, or to an electrical motor that allows you to tilt the mirror by pushing a button. 
<P>
So if your mom, husband, wife, etc., is displeased with you for re-adjusting all the mirrors, remind them that you're just being a safe driver!
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Rear View Mirror</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The rear view mirror is a wide rectangular mirror that you (the driver) use to view anything behind the car. You don't have to take your eyes off the road to turn your head around. 
<P>
On most cars, the rear view mirror has a "day/night" selection switch that tilts the mirror inside its glass housing without tilting the exterior glass housing itself. The switch tilts the mirror upward, about five degrees, to divert the majority of the light striking the mirror up on to the headliner of the car. The light that you see when the mirror is on the "night" setting is actually bouncing off the glass housing (a good reason to keep it clean). The percentage of light reflected into your eyes in the night position, is very small compared to the amount that would normally be reflected into your eyes in its normal position.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Headrests</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Headrests are a safety device and enhancement. If a headrest is properly positioned behind your head, it can protect you from injury during a collision. Some safety conscious car manufacturers have headrests for both front and rear seats.
<P>
Headrests can also be safety hazards if they are positioned improperly. A headrest that is adjusted too high can obscure the driver's rear view. If a headrest is adjusted too low, during the event of a collision, it can "chop" the driver or passengers in the neck, rather than protect the head.

<P>
Rear-impact accidents occur frequently and are increasing with the greater density of today's traffic. In rear end collisions, the car is suddenly accelerated forward, with the result that the head of an occupant is snapped backwards over the seat back. This can cause a serious "whiplash" injury to the neck. To prevent such injuries, some seats are fitted with head restraints. Many of these, however, are not used as designed, because the user has to adjust his own head restraint so that it is in the right position to protect them in a collision. In the United States, for example, where nearly all head restraints are adjustable, field surveys have shown that 80% of the head restraints are in the fully down position all the time. As a result, head restraints are of hardly any benefit in an accident.
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Roll Bar</B></FONT></CENTER> 
<P>
The purpose of the roll bar is to protect driver and passengers from injury if the car rolls over onto its roof. A series of tubes that are welded together into a contoured shape, and then bolted directly to the frame members, or rails. Since frame members are located differently on different types of cars, a roll bar is very unique to an individual car, and must be designed for a specific car.
<P>
Although a roll bar is a very nice feature, it is not always practical, because there isn't a place to mount it. Roll bars are usually put on convertibles as an aftermarket add-on piece. A convertible provides no protection if it overturns.
<P>
Some cars have built-in "targa" roll bars. These are roll bars that are covered up by body work; they appear to be part of the body. Targa roll bars are generally flat and wide, instead of round like normal roll bars. Because they are wider, they are able to hold up the overturned car. They also look nice, because they look like a body panel. They do reduce rear visibility because of their greater width. Some targa roll bars are purely cosmetic, because they have no frame inside. This type of roll bar affords you about as much protection as the windshield, and so is not really a roll bar.  
<P>
Most cars don't come with roll bars, but all race cars have roll bars. Roll bars themselves are relatively inexpensive, but they usually require quite a bit of expensive installation work. Some roll bars provide better protection than others.
<P>
If you have a tendency to exceed the speed limit along winding roads or go off roading, you really ought to have a roll bar.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Rocker Panels</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
A rocker panel is a three or four inch piece of metal that runs along the bottom of the car body underneath the doors. Rocker panels are usually coated with a rock proof protectant which rubberizes the exterior surface before the car is painted. If you have mud flaps behind your wheels, this protects your rocker panels, as well as your fenders and your doors. Rocker panels are often made of chrome plating, and enhance the car.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Wheel Well</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The wheel well is either plastic or metal. Metal wheel wells are usually part of the body shell. Metal wheel wells strengthen the structure of the car because of their shape, and because they are strongly welded to the body shell. Most rear wheel wells are made of metal.  
<P>
Wheel wells are coated with a rock-proof, rubberized coating underneath, in order to prevent the rocks kicked up by the wheels from damaging the metal and making a lot of noise when they hit.  
<P>
Often the front wheel wells are made of plastic. This is because it is harder to mount the engine with the front wheel wells in place. Plastic wheel wells can be removed, and make it easier to mount the engine during the manufacturing of the car.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Front Quarter Panel</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The front quarter panel is composed of the body skin, or sheet metal, that runs from the front corner of the hood to the front of the door. It is usually a separate piece that is welded on in a few places. This makes it easy to replace if you get in a "fender bender." Front quarter panels can usually be replaced relatively inexpensively. 
<P>
Some newer vehicles use a rubber-like plastic for the fenders, which allows small impacts to be absorbed without damage.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Chassis Cross Member</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The chassis cross member is usually a heavy gauge piece of sheet metal that is bent into a convoluted channel shape. It is mounted onto the bottom of the chassis, and keeps the transmission firmly secured at the end where the drive shaft begins. On some cars, the cross member is removable. On other cars, it is part of the body shell.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Drive Shaft Clearance Tube</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The drive shaft clearance tube is a section of the floor pan. It is actually shaped more like a tunnel than a tube. It provides clearance for the drive shaft, the universal joints, and the rear of the transmission. The underside of the drive shaft clearance tube is coated with a rubberized sound absorption coating that reduces road noise.
<P>
Only rear-wheel drive vehicles have drive shaft clearance tubes. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Transmission Tunnel</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The transmission tunnel is a cone-shaped formation in the front of the floor pan. Its shape duplicates the transmission, but it is a little bit bigger and provides about two inches of clearance around the transmission. You won't find the transmission tunnel in front wheel drive cars, because the transmission is on the side of the engine completely under the hood. Only rear-wheel drive cars have transmission tunnels.  
<P>
A manual transmission tunnel has a hole in it to allow the shift linkage to be worked from inside the car. The shifter linkage goes through the transmission tunnel. A rubber boot on the shifter linkage stops dirt, dust and exhaust fumes from entering the passenger compartment. The rubber boot is mounted onto the transmission tunnel and fastened securely around the gearshift linkage. This arrangement is not necessary with an automatic transmission, because the shift linkage does not usually go through the transmission tunnel. The shift linkage in automatic transmission usually goes in front of the firewall from the base of the steering column.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Rear End Tunnel</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The rear end tunnel is a tube with a pumpkin shaped indentation in the center which provides clearance for the drive shaft and the housing of the differential. It allows the rear end to travel up and down with suspension motion; it clears the differential housing by a maximum of three or four inches when the suspension is fully compressed. The rear end tunnel often forms the front of the trunk floor. It is attached to the wheel wells on each side as well as the floor pan and the trunk floor.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Springs</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Springs all have one thing in common; they are made of specially formulated steel which is tempered to prevent it from loosing the shape it is bent into when "sprung." For this reason, a spring will compress or extend and then return almost entirely to it original shape. There are two kinds of springs, leaf springs and coil springs.  
<P>
Springs have life spans that are determined by the number of cycles they can withstand over a certain period of time. Occasionally a spring will break on a car while it is being driven. This doesn't usually lead to a collision, but if a spring breaks while you are driving , the car will suddenly lurch downward-- you've got yourself a low-rider! The bottom of the car might be damaged, or you might lose your muffler!
<P>
Leaf springs are made of individual springs, or plates. If you break one plate of your leaf-spring, it won't be noticeable, but your car might begin to lean to one side or the other.  
<P>
Coil springs, if they break, will suddenly drop the front or rear end of your car and impair driving under the normal conditions of full suspension travel.
<P>
Usually the springs surround the shock absorbers, because space can be saved by putting the shock absorber inside the spring. The spring on a MacPherson strut suspension rotates along with the strut body itself; it pivots on a bearing mounted to the wheel well. 
<P>
Some springs have adjustment dials mounted between them and their mounting points. This allows the mechanic to increase the spring tension and the ride height, you desire. This type of spring is usually used only in high performance cars, because it allows the raising and lowering of suspension system's height. The suspension system is lowered for competitive events and then raised afterwards. This way, the car can be driven normally and deal with road hazards such as speed bumps.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Nuts and Bolts</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
Nuts are hexagon shaped metal objects with a threaded hole through them so that they can be attached to bolts. Bolts are cylindrical objects with "threads" on the outside of them which enable them to be threaded into nuts. The hexagon shaped end classifies a "bolt". A "bolt" without an end is classified as a "lug" or "stud."
<P>
Most bolts have what is termed as a "right-handed" thread. This is a spiraling thread. If you were inserting a right-handed threaded bolt into a threaded hole, you would turn it clockwise. Some bolts have "left-handed" threads. When inserting this type of bolt, you turn it counter clockwise.
<P>
There are many "grades" of nuts and bolts. Grades depend on the quality of the materials and the tolerances observed during the manufacture of the nuts and bolts. The ends of bolts and the faces of nuts are almost always marked with symbols denoting their quality standards. Unfortunately, in recent years it has become apparent through various government investigations, that unscrupulous individuals have been importing nuts and bolts with symbols printed on them that falsely denote a higher quality bolt. In other words, these individuals import and sell lead with gold stamped on it. This doesn't sound particularly dangerous, but in the cases of certain airplane and amusement park incidents, it has been proven that such a business deal, in conjunction with an innocuous object such as a nut or a bolt, can lead to tragedy.
<P>
Nuts and bolts are often separated by washers. Washers have many shapes and sizes, but serve one purpose. This purpose is to give the nut and the bolt a firm hardened surface for bedding against. The parts that you put together with nuts and bolts are usually not as strong as the nuts and bolts themselves. The washers allow the nuts and bolts to be fully tightened down, providing a wider area to spread out the force of the tightening. Washers keep the nuts and bolts from digging into the material when they are tightened. Washers shaped like a broken section of a coil are called "lock washers." They are designed to prevent the nut from rattling loose.
<P>
"Allen" bolts have socket heads, or a recessed hexagon shaped hole in the top. You need Allen keys or wrenches to tighten or loosen the Allen bolts.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Glove Box</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The glove box, or glove compartment, is a small storage cabinet in the dashboard of an automobile. It is used to store small parts which fall off the interior, and usually a few forgotten parking tickets. The smart motorist also keeps the following in the glove box: a flashlight, an air pressure gauge, and a few paper towels.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Hood Release</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The hood release is a small lever which is usually mounted under the dash. It is connected to the hood latch by a cable.  The hood latch has a safety feature which requires a second latch to be released before the hood will open. This is to prevent accidental opening while driving.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Visor</B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P>
The visor is a flat sunshade, usually movable. It is attached to the interior of the car at the top of the windshield. Visors protect the eyes of the driver and passengers from the sun's glare.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>First Aid for Your Car</B></FONT></CENTER>  
  <BR> <BR> 
 <P>  Everyone knows that it is important to have a basic knowledge of  
   first aid in case of an accidental injury. First aid is used to keep  
   the body functioning as comfortably as possible until the victim can  
   be taken to a hospital to see a doctor. If a person were to have an  
   accident at home, first aid is a short-term necessity, but if he is  
   picnicking or camping in the wilderness, first aid would be needed to  
   keep the victim functioning for a much longer length of time.  
  
  <P>  Try to think of the car as a victim of an accident when a breakdown  
   occurs. This, of course, is not a living, breathing body, so it is  
   easy to just shut off the motor and let the car sit until a tow truck  
   arrives to take it off to the hospital (garage) to be taken care of   
   by a doctor (mechanic). Unfortunately, it is not in the nature of a   
   car to break down while idling in the drive-way or backing out into   
   the street (although it sometimes happens). The greatest problems  
   with cars usually occur while in the middle of an intersection,  
   driving through traffic, or on a long trip many miles from home.  
   Since we can't place a sling on the car's wheel or bandage the  
   battery while we tote it off to the nearest garage for emergency  
   care, it is important that we have some basic knowledge of car repair  
   to keep it going until we can get it to a mechanic for professional  
   care. Anyone can repair many of the breakdowns that a car encounters  
   well enough to drive it to a garage. Some repairs will even solve the  
   problem altogether. In either case, a little basic knowledge of car  
   repair can keep the driver from being stranded.  
  
   <P> There are some breakdowns, however, that can't be repaired by the  
   driver. Even so, just knowing the symptoms of the car breakdown can   
   save money, because a mechanic that thinks you know what you're   
   talking about is not so apt to overcharge you.  <BR> <BR> 
 <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                Safety Rules for Automobile Self-help</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P>  When working on a car, be prepared in advance to have grease on your  
   hands and you probably will break a fingernail. In addition to these  
   minor inconveniences, there is always a risk in working on a car. Use  
   common sense when making inspections and repairs. Know how to fix an  
   element before you begin, and then work efficiently. Below are some   
   common sense rules to follow while working on a car:  

  <P> 1. Gasoline fumes and hydrogen gas are both explosive, and both  
   gasoline and oil are flammable. Do not smoke while making repairs or  
   even when raising the hood to diagnose the problem. Keep a small fire  
   extinguisher nearby while working on the car, particularly if the  
   work is being done under the hood.  
  
<P>  2. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide - a poisonous gas. Do not  
   run the engine in a closed area unless there is ample ventilation. If  
   you begin to feel sleepy while working on a car, move away from the  
   vehicle into the fresh air immediately. By the same token, if you can  
   smell the exhaust while driving, open the windows at once.  
  
  <P>  3. The car battery contains sulfuric acid, which can burn, and it  
   also emits hydrogen gas, which may explode. Wear gloves while working  
   around a battery and do not smoke near it.  
  
 <P> 4. Car batteries can give electrical shocks and are a fire hazard.  
   Disconnect the battery while working on the fuel line or electrical  
   system. It is only necessary to remove the ground cable, which is  
   easily identified by a black mark or a minus (-) sign on the battery  
   casing at the terminal.  
  
  <P>  5. It is easy to get a spark or electrical volt, creating a fire  
   hazard when jump starting a car. Be sure to connect the positive (+)  
   terminal of the helping car to the positive terminal of the disabled  
   car, and the negative (-) terminal to the engine frame before turning  
   on either engine. Also, do not touch the positive cable to the end of  
   any other cable or metal part while jump starting the car.  
  
  <P>  6. Radiator hoses, exhaust pipes, manifolds and mufflers can be very  
   hot to the touch. Allow time for these parts to cool off before  
   working on the car. If there is some reason that you can't wait, wear  
   heavy gloves and be very careful. DO NOT remove the radiator cap in  
   one turn. Turn it slowly to half off and allow the steam to escape.  
   Always use gloves or a rag. When the steam has escaped, turn the cap  
   off fully. Always keep your face turned away from the radiator cap.  
  
 <P>  7. Loose clothing can easily be pulled into moving machinery parts.  
   A loose shirt cuff, necktie, dangling jewelry, frilled blouses, or  
   long hair can all be pulled into a moving part while making repairs.  
   Be sure to remove such hazards. Caps without brims are considered  
   safer than those with brims, and it is advisable to wear a sturdy  
   pair of shoes or boots to protect the feet.  
  
<P>  8. The jack may collapse while holding up the car. Do not - under any  
   circumstances - crawl under a car that is jacked up, unless you have  
   a jack stand, which is made for that purpose. Be sure the jack stand  
   is rated to support the weight of the car. Do not use metal drums,  
   buckets, bricks, concrete blocks, or wooden assemblies in the place  
   of the jack stand. All of these may crumble or collapse.  
  
  <P>  9. Slipping on oil, gasoline or other leaking fluids can cause  
   serious injuries. To prevent slipping by the person working on the  
   car, or by anyone else, wipe up all spills immediately. Be  
   particularly careful when wiping up flammable or chemical fluids.  
  
<P> 10. The car must be stabilized before fixing a flat tire, so that it  
   will not jump the jack or roll. Try to stop the car on level ground  
   to change a tire. If the car has an automatic transmission, put the  
   gearshift into "park"; if the transmission is manual, shift into  
   reverse. Before jacking up the car, place a brick, stone, 2 x 4, or  
   whatever is within reach, in front of the front wheel and in back of  
   the rear wheel that will stay on the ground. This will stabilize the  
   car and prevent rolling. Be careful when jacking up a car on roads  
   that allow semi truck traffic. The force of the air current produced  
   by large vehicles speeding past, may be enough to topple a car which  
   is up on a jack.  
  
 <P> 11. When confronted with a serious car problem on a car which is   
   still under warranty, call a tow truck. Any attempts to repair a   
   major part could void the warranty.  
  
<P> 12. A car problem should not be worked on unless you have specific  
   knowledge on what is wrong and how to fix it. Car first aid is for  
   emergency and basic repairs only. Major problems should be taken to a  
   mechanic. Otherwise, you may find that you have created even more  
   problems than you had to start with, besides a higher repair bill for  
   straightening out your mistakes.  
 
<P>  13. Gasoline, brake fluid, and certain cleaning fluids used in  
   repairing an automobile need special precautions to prevent fire.  
   Fuel, thinner, and other combustibles should always be kept in closed  
   containers designed for the purpose; these should also be well marked  
   and stored safely.  
  
 <P>  Smoking and unshielded flames should always be avoided while working  
   on a car. As a further protection against fire, oil and grease rags  
   should also be kept in containers; use care, however, that  
   spontaneous combustion does not occur.  
  
 <P> 14. There are many precautions that should be observed when using  
   tools.   

  
 <P>   Files should never be used without a handle, because there is always  
   the danger of running the point into the palm of the hand.  Files  
   should also not be used as levers or hammers. Files are made with  
   hard temper and are quite brittle, so if hammered, small pieces may  
   fly off and cause severe wounds or loss of eyesight.   
  
  <P>  Hammers or sledges should be checked to see that the head is attached  
   securely so that it doesn't fly off when the tool is used.  
  
   When the head of a chisel is mushroomed, it should be thrown away or  
   reground to prevent bits of steel from flying off and causing damage.  
   A shield or helmet should always be worn when grinding.   
  
  <P>  Pull on the handle of a wrench, rather than pushing on it to prevent  
   the danger of skinning the knuckles. When the jaws of the wrench  
   become worn or sprung, the tool should be disposed of.   
  
  <P>  DO NOT point an air gun in the direction of anyone, because the high  
   pressure can blow dirt particles at such high speed that they will  
   puncture the skin and/or get in the eyes.  <BR> <BR> 
  
                    <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Emergency Stops</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P>  A sudden emergency, such as loss in steering control, does not give  
   the driver time to consult a manual or even to ask questions. The  
   driver will need to know what to do immediately in such situations,  
   and may gain some knowledge by studying the emergency measures listed  
   below: 

<P>   1. A tire suddenly blows out: Steer the car as straight as possible,  
   but do not slam on the brakes. Apply even, gentle pressure to the  
   brake pedal. Then pull off the road slowly onto the shoulder. Try to  
   park the car on level ground.  
  
  <P>  2. The brakes give out: If you have time, quickly pump the brake  
   pedal; this may tighten up the brake and provide some stopping power.  
   If there is not time for this, apply the parking brake slowly but  
   firmly. Another method that can be used if there is time and pumping  
   doesn't help is to shift down on the gears - from Drive to D-1 and  
   then to D-2. You may even have time to shift into reverse. Do not  
   shift into "park," however. You might turn off the ignition with the  
   car in gear. DO NOT turn the key into the lock position, because this  
   will lock the steering wheel. If none of these procedures work, try  
   to sideswipe guardrails, signposts, or other obstructions that will  
   slow the car. Direct hits may cause serious injury, however, so be  
   careful.  
  
<P>   3. Lights go off: If the lights should suddenly go off at night, try  
   the hazard lights immediately. Even directional signals will produce  
   some light. At the same time, brake the car slowly and pull off the  
   road and stop. DO NOT jam on the brakes. You have plenty of time and  
   space in which to brake to a stop safely unless you are on a hair-pin  
   curve on the side of a mountain.  
  
<P>  4. Steering locks or gives out: Apply the brakes gently. Do not slam  
   on the brakes, because it may cause the car to swerve. Turn on the  
   hazard lights and blow the horn to warn other drivers of the danger.  
   Get off the road as soon as possible.   
  
<P>  5. Accelerator sticks: Turn off the engine, shift to neutral, and  
   pull off the road. Power steering and brakes will become manual, so  
   more effort is necessary to turn and stop. You may now try pulling  
   the pedal up with you foot or hand. Stuck pedals are usually due to  
   broken springs or a blockage in the throttle linkage.  Sometimes, an  
   item such as a floor mat may be pressing on the pedal.  If you cannot  
   find the solution to the problem, call a tow truck. DO NOT drive the  
   car if you can't solve the problem.  
  
 <P>  6. Hood flies up: Look under the space below the hood or stick your  
   head out of the window to see. Gently apply the brakes; do not slam  
   them on. Use signals to turn off the road. The hood latch is probably  
   broken. If you can't tie the hood down with wire, rope, or a necktie,  
   call a tow truck for help. If the hood latch was not completely  
   latched, you may be able to close it down and drive on. If you can't  
   see, don't drive.  
  
<P> 7. Car drops into deep water: If the windows are electric, open them  
   immediately and hang on tightly to the steering wheel, dash, car  
   seat, door handles or whatever is stable for a handhold. Wait until  
   the car fills up with water and then swim through the windows. If the  
   windows are crank operated, wait until the car is almost filled with  
   water; then crank the windows down to escape. There will be enough  
   air between the water and the bottom of the car roof to supply your  
   breathing needs. The windows are always the best means of escape,  
   because the doors have too much water pressure against them to be  
   opened.  
  
  <P> 8. Fire in car: Pull off to the side of the road immediately and get  
   out of the car! If it is just a small fire, you may be able to  
   smother it with a blanket, dirt or a coat. DO NOT use water! If the  
   fire is within the fuel system, move at least 500 feet away from the  
   car, because it will likely explode.  
  
<P>   9. Head-on crash: If the seat belts are not fastened, throw your body  
   across the front seat or the floor. Try to get as low in the car as  
   possible - below the windows and the windshield.  
  
 <P>   10. Electric power cable: If you're in the car and a power cable, is  
   on your car, stay in the car until help arrives.  
  
 <P>  11. Bee in the car: Gently brake the car to a stop on the shoulder of  
   the road. Don't slam on the brakes; the car behind you might run into  
   you and cause worse problems than a bee sting. After stopping, roll  
   down the windows and coax the bee out of the car.  
  
 <P> 12. Sudden window fogging: If the fogging problem is outside the car,  
   turn on the windshield wipers. If it's inside the car, wipe the glass  
   with your hand and brake gently to pull the car off the road.  Turn  
   on the defroster and wait until you have clear vision before  
   continuing to drive.  
  
  <P>  13. Car skids: DO NOT slam on the brakes! In fact, stay off the  
   brakes completely. Ease off the gas and steer the car in the  
   direction that you want the "front" of the car to go.  
  
<P>  14. Wheels fall into low shoulder: Brake gently to slow the car when  
   the wheels go off the road. Don't jerk the steering wheel. Ride on  
   the shoulder until the car can be turned onto the road. This prevents  
   skidding.  
  
  <P> 15. Engine quits: Shift the car into neutral gear and coast onto the  
   shoulder of the road, braking gently. Cars with power brakes and  
   power steering will need more effort than normal.  
  
   <P> 16. Whatever the circumstances, buckle up for safety!  

  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      When The Car Doesn't Work</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P>  BEFORE a car needs repairs, the owner should check the car's manual  
   to see if maintenance is needed. Failure to care for the car, and  
   ignoring the initial warning signs (funny noises, problems that "fix  
   themselves", etc) will produce more extensive and costly damage in  
   the long run.  
  
  <P>  I. Starting Problems  
  
  <P>  Problems encountered in starting are usually  
   due to the condition of the battery (clicking noises, no sound or  
   slow grinding). These problems can often be solved by jump starting  
   or charging the battery. If there is no response after trying these  
   cures, it will probably be necessary to get experienced help or have  
   your car inspected and serviced by a professional.   
  
   <P> II.   Moving Problems  
  
  <P>  1. Problems with the engine hesitating, cutting out, being weak, or  
   having difficulty with the idling should all be carefully inspected  
   by an experienced mechanic. Overheating may be due to a need for  
   additional coolant in the radiator or a need to unload excess weight  
   (as when pulling a trailer). Turn off all accessories; i.e., the air  
   conditioner. If this doesn't help, get professional help.  
  
  <P>  2. Transmission problems should always be inspected for repair or  
   adjustment by a professional mechanic. If the car is driveable, drive  
   slowly and carefully to the nearest service facility. If in doubt  
   about driving the car, call a tow truck.  
  
 <P>   III. Stopping Problems:   When the brakes fail to hold, or if they  
   squeal, grab or drag, they should be inspected and cared for at a  
   specialized brake shop. When the problem is due to worn tires, the  
   tires should be replaced at once before damaging other, more  
   expensive elements of the car.  <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Tips on Tires</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
  <P>  There may be instructions for using the jack pasted on the underside  
   of the trunk lid, so when changing a tire, look there first. If it is  
   possible, the jack base should be supported with a wide, flat board  
   or plywood. Don't use brick or concrete for this, because they are  
   apt to crumble. Do not get under the car after lifting it with the  
   jack for any reason!   
  
 <P>   Slide the spare tire into the wheel well, match lugs and lug holes,  
   and lift the wheel up onto the lugs. If the spare tire is smooth or  
   for emergency use only, drive slowly and have the tire replaced as  
   soon as possible.  <BR> <BR> 
  
  <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>How to Change A Tire</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
 <P>   Drive off the road and turn on the hazard lights. Make sure to chock  
   the good wheels in front and back, and have the car shifted into park  
   or neutral with the parking brake on. Try to stop the car on a level  
   surface. There should be a jack, lug wrench, chock for the wheels,  
   rubber hammer, and penetrating oil in the trunk of the car.  
  
  <P>  Pry the hubcap off with a screwdriver or the end of the lug wrench  
   (or the jack handle). Some hubcaps require a special wrench which is  
   usually in the glove compartment. Loosen the nuts on the wheel before  
   jacking up the car. Push down counterclockwise on the lug wrench; use  
   your foot, if it is necessary. Spray any rusted nuts with penetrating  
   oil, then wait a few minutes before loosening. Chock the good wheel,  
   and position the jack at the wheel to be changed.   
  
 <P>  Bumper jack lifts will fit the slot in the bumper; scissors and  
   side-lift jacks will be inserted into pads under the side of the car.  
   Position the jack as directed in the car's owner manual. Some cars   
   have diagrams where the tire is stored. Jack up the car until the  
   wheel is just lifted from the ground. Remove nuts, put on the spare  
   wheel, and replace the nuts so that they are screwed securely by  
   hand. Then tighten the nuts with the lug wrench in a criss-cross  
   pattern. Don't over tighten. Let the jack down by flipping the lever  
   or by turning the scissors down slowly. Turn the wheel nuts tight  
   with the wrench in a criss-cross pattern.  
  
  <P>  Replace the hub cap so that the valve stem of the tire slips through  
   the hole or slit in the hubcap. Tap the hub cap lightly with a rubber  
   hammer or hit it solidly with the hand. Check to make sure it is  
   securely fitted.   
  
  <P>  When a tire has a slow leak, an aerosol flat-tire fixer can be used.  
   Follow the directions on the can; then drive to a service station as  
   soon as possible for tire repair.  
  
   <P> Tires can squeal due to low air pressure or worn tires. Check the air  
   pressure or, if tires are badly worn, have them replaced.  
  
  <P>  Tires may wear rapidly due to poor alignment, low air pressure, or  
   worn front-end components. Check the air pressure. If this is not the  
   cause of the problem, take the car in for professional care.  
  
  <P>  Tires may wobble from many causes. First check the tire air pressure,  
   loose wheel nuts, and worn tires. Have the problem corrected, if this  
   is the source. Tire wobbling may also be due to poor alignment,  
   missing balance weights, bent wheel rims, or worn steering linkage.  
   If you can't correct the problems yourself, have the car checked by  
   an experienced or professional mechanic.  <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Other Problems</B></FONT></CENTER>   

  <P> 1. Anytime that smoke, steam, fluids or odors are escaping from the  
   car (other than those caused from a cold engine, cold atmosphere or  
   odors from diesel engines and catalytic converters), the car should  
   be checked by someone with repair experience or by a professional  
   mechanic. These problems could be caused by the electrical wiring or  
   by defective components and should be corrected immediately.  
  
  <P> 2. Any noises such as squealing, hissing, clunking, whirring, and  
   clicking, coming from the front, back, or under the hood, should be  
   inspected and repaired by an experienced repairman.  
  
  <P> 3. Windshield wiper problems are often due to a blown fuse or a need  
   for new wiper. If the problem is from some other cause, such as  
   wiring or burned-out motor, it should be repaired by a competent  
   repairman.  
  
<P> 4. When lights, either headlights (bright and dim), taillights,  
   signal lights, flashers, etc., are out or constantly on, check the  
   fuses. Other defects may be in the wiring or defective elements. Have  
   the problem corrected immediately.  
<BR> <BR>  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Miscellaneous Emergencies</B></FONT></CENTER> 

 <P> 1. The driver is locked out of the car.  
  
 <P>   Button locks: Use a wire or a coat hanger. Straighten the wire and  
   make a small loop or fishhook shape at one end. Slip the wire through  
   the crack of the window or down through the top crack of the door.  
   You may slip the wire past the weather-stripping of the door. Jiggle  
   the wire around so that the hook will loop around the button lock and  
   then try to lift up the lock. Have a lot of patience.   
  
  <P>  If you are unable to pull up the lock for some reason, call a police  
   station and tell them the circumstances. A service station may also  
   help to unlock the door. The police call is free - a service station  
   will probably charge about $25.00  
  
  <P>  NOTE: The weather-stripping around the window often costs more than  
   the locksmith or tow truck driver's fee.   
  
<P>  2. Car is stuck  
  
  <P>  (a) on ice: When moving the car, keep a steady rate of speed to  
   prevent getting stuck again. Drive slowly. The car may skid some, but  
   as long as it is moving, chances of getting to solid ground are at  
   the maximum.  
  
  <P>  To get off an ice patch, try kitty litter, sand, dirt, or floor mats  
   for friction. Sprinkle the abrasives (front or back) for about  
   fifteen feet. Put the sack of sand or kitty litter back into the  
   trunk and don't stop for anything until the car is on solid ground.  
   Try not to spin the wheels, but if no abrasive material is available,  
   try letting some air out of the tires to gain some friction.  
  
  <P>  (b) in snow: There are many ways to free a car from the snow. Try  
   rocking the car back and forth by shifting quickly from drive (or   
   first gear) to reverse. Work out a rhythm to the rocking. After  
   rocking for a few minutes, shift into neutral and increase engine  
   speed to let the transmission cool. Once the car is free, keep it  
   moving. Keep the wheels as straight as possible while rocking. If the  
   wheels heat up, let them cool before continuing. Heated tires will  
   sink deeper into the snow. Don't spin the wheels; this will heat up  
   the wheels and also cause ice to form under the wheels. Put a manual  
   transmission into second gear to rock it.  
  
 <P>   You may be able to shovel enough snow away from the wheels to get  
   some traction. If there is no shovel, use the base of the jack or  
   fold over the floor mat in the place of the shovel.  
  
  <P>  Car chains probably can't be mounted at this time, but they may be  
   used to provide traction. Tie the chains to the bumper so that the  
   car will pull them along until you are on solid ground. Strap chains  
   are handy for traction on ice, snow, and sometimes on mud. They can  
   be mounted without jacking up the car.  
  
   <P> Put several bags of sand in the trunk of the car for added traction.  
   Even if the weight of the sand doesn't help, you will have sand to  
   spread under the tires when the car is stuck.  
  
  <P>  (c) in mud: Being stuck in mud is worse than being stuck in either  
   ice or snow, because mud clings to the undercarriage of the car until  
   there is no way to get any traction. Spinning the wheels only drives  
   them deeper. When stuck in the mud, use the same methods as getting  
   out of snow or ice. If these methods don't work, call a tow truck.  
  
 <P> (d) in sand: Spinning the wheels in sand drives only drives them down  
   deeper. The undercarriage is hung up once the car is sunk to axle  
   level. At this point, a tow truck will be needed. If the car is not  
   up to the hubs in the sand, try letting a little bit of air out of  
   the tires to increase the friction.  
  
  <P>  3. Blizzard Conditions. When the car can't be moved during blizzard  
   conditions, don't panic. Below are several survival tips that may  
   help to weather the storm.  
  
 <P>   (a) If the trouble is just starting, look for shelter: a house, barn,  
   store, or service station nearby.  
  
  <P>  (b) If you can't see a place of shelter, stay in the car. DO NOT  
   wander around, looking for shelter and get lost in the storm.  
  
 <P>   (c) Run the engine and the heater for ten minutes every half hour.  
   Open the windows a little bit while the engine is running. Engine  
   idle consumes about one gallon of gasoline per hour. Five gallons of  
   fuel is enough for one day with this method. Don't race the motor and  
   waste fuel.  
  
  <P>  (d) Open the door once in a while so that it does not become snow  
   packed. When opening the door, check to make sure the exhaust pipe is  
   not blocked by snow.  
  
 <P>   (e) Blow the horn and flash the lights while the engine is running.  
   Don't run down the battery in the meantime.  
  
  <P>  (f) Stretch arms and legs frequently inside the car.  
  
  <P>  (g) Use anything available to keep warm: rip out car carpeting for  
   blankets, use floor mats, linings from the trunk, or car seat covers.  
   If the situation becomes really bad, rip the upholstery from the rear  
   seats and roof of the car.  
  
  <P>  (h) If you absolutely must drive in hazardous conditions, carry food,  
   water and extra clothing in the car in case of emergencies.  
  
  <P>  4. When the car breaks down on a Federal Interstate, the driver  
   should lift the hood of the car, turn on the emergency signals, and  
   wait for help. This is also true when the car runs out of gas. The  
   person stopping may consent to send a tow truck or may even offer you  
   a ride to the next service station. If a passenger car does not stop,  
   the Highway Patrol will come along eventually and offer help. There  
   are situations, however, that are not as ideal as those on Federal  
   Interstate roads. Drivers sometimes have accidents on isolated  
   roadways - either running out of gas or breakdown of parts.  The best  
   advice comes from a patrolman, who says to use your common sense. Be  
   sure to check your gas gauge, tires, and other accessories and parts  
   before taking trips on lonely roads. If your car does have a failure  
   or runs out of gas, it is not always wise to lift the hood,  
   especially if you plan to leave the area. It is probably best to walk  
   to the nearest farm or rural home and ask to use the phone (or ask  
   the homeowner to call for help, if he doesn't want to let you into  
   the house). It would probably be best to lock the car if you plan to  
   walk for any distance or to be away from it for any length of time.  
   If the car breaks down during a storm, such as a blizzard, stay in  
   the car and follow the advice given for blizzard conditions (#3  
   above).  
  
   Hitchhiking is illegal, but a policeman will not arrest you if your  
   car has broken down and you are walking in search of help. It is,  
   however, a poor means of travel except in an emergency.  
<BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                      Periodic Care for The Car</B></FONT></CENTER> 
  
   If the car owner has periodic maintenance done on the car, it will  
   avoid many of the problems which might otherwise occur. Checkups can  
   be carried out at regular intervals. Below is a checklist that may  
   help in minimizing car problems:  
<PRE>	
  1. Every time the car is filled with gasoline, either the driver or  
      the service attendant should:  
      (a) Check the engine oil  
      (b) Check the transmission-fluid level  
      (c) Check the power-steering-fluid level  
      (d) Check the drive belts  
      (e) Check the tires to see if they need air or are badly worn  
  
   2. Monthly maintenance with the engine cold includes:  
  
      (a) Check the level of the coolant in the radiator (not the  
         reservoir tank)  
  
      (b) Check the level of the fluid in the master cylinder  
  
   3. Monthly maintenance with the tires cold includes:  
  
      (a) Check tire's air pressure  
  
      (b) Look for tire wear and damage  
  
   4. Monthly maintenance at night with a friend includes:  
  
      (a) Check headlights (both dim and bright)  
      (b) Check taillights  
      (c) Check directional signal lights  
      (d) Check brake lights  
  
 5. 3,000-mile maintenance includes:  
  
      (a) Change oil and oil filters  
      (b) Car lubrication  
      (c) Check air cleaner and replace, if necessary  
  
  6. 12,000-mile maintenance includes:  
  
      (a) Check exhaust system for leaks  
      (b) Check wheel alignment  
      (c) Lubricate locks and hinges  
      (d) Change spark plugs  
      (e) Repack wheel bearings  
      (f) Drain and replace antifreeze  
      (g) Replace windshield wiper blades  
      (h) Get a general engine tune-up  
      (i) Bleed and refill brake-fluid system  
  
 7. Every 24,000 miles, in addition to the 12,000-mile maintenance:  
  
      (a) Tune up engine, and replace PCV valve

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Engine System</B></FONT> 		</CENTER><BR> 
                   
  <P>  The internal combustion engine burns fuel within the cylinders and  
   converts the expanding force of the combustion or "explosion" into  
   rotary force used to propel the vehicle. There are several types of  
   internal combustion engines: two and four cycle reciprocating piston  
   engines, gas turbines, free piston, and rotary combustion engines.  
   The four cycle reciprocating engine has been refined to such a degree  
   that it has almost complete dominance in the automotive field.   
  
   <P> The engine is the heart of the automobile. It converts fuel into the  
   energy that powers the automobile. To operate, it requires clean air  
   for the fuel, water for cooling, electricity (which it generates) for  
   igniting the fuel, and oil for lubrication. A battery and electric  
   starter get it going.  
  
   <P> Charles and Frank Duryea built the first American automobile in 1892.  
   In the winter of 1895/96 they produced 13 Duryeas, which became the  
   first horseless carriages regularly manufactured in the United  
   States.  
  
  <P>  In 1900, at the first National Automobile Show in New York City,   
   visitors overwhelmingly chose the electric car. Most people thought   
   the gasoline engine would never last. One critic of the engine wrote  
   that it was noisy, unreliable, and elephantine; that it vibrated so  
   violently as to "loosen one's dentures." He went on to give the  
   opinion that the gasoline motor would never be a factor in America's  
   growing automobile industry. People were afraid that gasoline engines  
   would explode. Motorweek magazine referred to them as "explosives."  
   At the show, a bucket brigade was standing by every time an  
   "explosive," was cranked. However, just three years later, at the  
   same show, the number of cars with four-stroke internal combustion  
   gasoline engines had risen sharply.  
  
   <P> Each "cylinder" of the typical car engine has a "piston" which moves  
   back and forth within the cylinder (this is called "reciprocating").  
   Each piston is connected to the "crankshaft" by means of a link known  
   as a "connecting rod".   <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                    The Piston, Rings, and Wrist Pin</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P>  The piston converts the potential energy of the fuel, into the  
   kinetic energy that turns the crankshaft. The piston is a cylindrical  
   shaped hollow part that moves up and down inside the engine's  
   cylinder. It has grooves around its perimeter near the top where  
   rings are placed. The piston fits snugly in the cylinder. The piston  
   rings are used to ensure a snug "air tight" fit.  
  
   <P> The piston requires four strokes (two up and two down) to do its job.  
   The first is the intake stroke. This is a downward stroke to fill the  
   cylinder with a fuel and air mixture. The second is an upward stroke  
   to compress the mixture. Right before the piston reaches its maximum  
   height in the cylinder, the spark plug fires and ignites the fuel.  
   This action causes the piston to make its third stroke (downward).  
   The third stroke is the power stroke; it is this stroke that powers  
   the engine. On the fourth stroke, the burned gases are sent out  
   through the exhaust system.  
  
  <P>  The wrist pin connects the piston to the connecting rod. The  
   connecting rod comes up through the bottom of the piston. The wrist  
   pin is inserted into a hole (about half way up) that goes through the  
   side of the piston, where it is attached to the connecting rod.  
  
  <P>  Pistons are made of aluminum, because it is light and a good heat   
   conductor. Pistons perform several functions. Pistons transmit the  
   driving force of combustion to the crankshaft. This causes the  
   crankshaft to rotate. The piston also acts as a moveable gas-tight  
   plug that keeps the combustion in the cylinder. The piston acts as a  
   bearing for the small end of the connecting-rod. Its toughest job is  
   to get rid of some of the heat from combustion, and send it  
   elsewhere.  
  
  <P>  The piston head or "crown" is the top surface against which the  
   explosive force is exerted. It may be flat, concave, convex or any  
   one of a great variety of shapes to promote turbulence or help  
   control combustion. In some, a narrow groove is cut into the piston  
   above the top ring to serve as a "heat dam" to reduce the amount of  
   heat reaching the top ring.  <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Timing Chain/belt </B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The automobile engine uses a metal timing chain, or a flexible  
   toothed timing belt to rotate the camshaft. The timing chain/belt is  
   driven by the crankshaft. The timing chain, or timing belt is used to  
   "time" the opening and closing of the valves. The camshaft rotates  
   once for every two rotations of the crankshaft. <BR> <BR>  
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           The Cylinder Head</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> The cylinder head is the metal part of the engine that encloses and  
   covers the cylinders. Bolted on to the top of the block, the cylinder  
   head contains combustion chambers, water jackets and valves (in  
   overhead-valve engines). The head gasket seals the passages within  
   the head-block connection, and seals the cylinders as well.  
  
   <P> Henry Ford sold his first production car, a 2-cylinder Model A, on  
   July 23, 1903.  <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Valve Ports </B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Valve ports are openings in the cylinder head. Intake ports let the  
   fuel mixture into the cylinder head, and exhaust ports let the  
   exhaust out.  <BR> <BR> 
 <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                 Valves</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The valve's job is to open and close the valve ports. If the ports  
   were always open, the fuel exploded in the combustion chamber would  
   leave through the ports. The explosion has to be kept in the  
   combustion chamber to push the piston down. The valves are set up to  
   open and close at exactly the right moment. One lets the fuel mixture  
   in and closes. After the fuel explodes and pushes the piston down,  
   the other valve lets the exhaust out.  <BR> <BR> 
 <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Valve Guides</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  
  <P> The valves are usually held in an upright position by the valve stem.  
   The valve stem is the long straight side of the valve, like the stem  
   of a flower. Holes are bored in the cylinder head for the valve  
   stems. Worn valve guides allow oil to enter the combustion chamber  
   and cause blue smoke in the exhaust.  <BR> <BR> 
 <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Valve Springs</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The valve springs keep the valves closed tightly against their seats  
   until the valve is opened by the cam. After the cam turns (releasing  
   pressure), the valve springs close the valves.<BR> <BR>   
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Valve Seals</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  <P>  The valve seal is a unit that goes over the end of the valve stem.  
   It keeps excess oil from getting between the valve guide and the  
   valve stem.  <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                Camshaft</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The camshaft is a round shaft with "lobes" (specially formed bumps)  
   which is driven by the timing belt or timing chain. It, directly or  
   through "lifters" and "pushrods" opens and closes the fuel and  
   exhaust valves. The camshaft turns at one-half of the crankshaft  
   speed. It is supported by bearings located in the front and rear of  
   the crankcase.  <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Rocker arms</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Rocker arms are used to transmit force from cam to valve. Riding on a  
   cam on the camshaft, rocker arms direct the upward motion of the lobe  
   of the cam into an opening motion of the valve stem.  <BR> <BR> 
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Push Rods</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Push Rods attach the valve lifter to the rocker arm. Through their  
   centers, oil is pumped to lubricate the valves and rocker arms.  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                Flywheel</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The flywheel is a fairly large wheel that is connected to the  
   crankshaft. It provides the momentum to keep the crankshaft turning  
   without the application of power. It does this by storing some of the  
   energy generated during the power stroke. Then it uses some of this  
   energy to drive the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons during  
   the three idle strokes of the 4-stroke cycle. This makes for a smooth  
   engine speed. The flywheel forms one surface of the clutch and is the  
   base for the ring gear.  <BR> <BR> 
 <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Horsepower</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Horsepower is a unit of power for measuring the rate at which a   
   device can perform mechanical work. Its abbreviation is hp. One   
   horsepower was defined as the amount of power needed to lift 33,000  
   pounds one foot in one minute.  <BR> <BR> 
 <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Oil Weights</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Oil weight, or viscosity, refers to how thick or thin the oil Is.  
   The temperature requirements set for oil by the Society of Automotive  
   Engineers (SAE) is 0 degrees F (low) and 210 degrees F (high).  
  
  <P>  Oils meeting the SAE's low temperature requirements have a "W" after  
   the viscosity rating (example: 10W), and oils that meet the high  
   ratings have no letter (example SAE 30). An oil is rated for  
   viscosity by heating it to a specified temperature, and then allowing  
   it to flow out of a specifically sized hole. Its viscosity rating is  
   determined by the length of time it takes to flow out of the hole. If  
   it flows quickly, it gets a low rating. If it flows slowly, it gets a  
   high rating.  
  
   <P> Engines need oil that is thin enough for cold starts, and thick   
   enough when the engine is hot. Since oil gets thinner when heated,   
   and thicker when cooled, most of us use what are called multi-grade,   
   or multi-viscosity oils. These oils meet SAE specifications for the  
   low temperature requirements of a light oil and the high temperature  
   requirements of a heavy oil. You will hear them referred to as  
   multi-viscosity, all-season and all-weather oils.  
  
   When choosing oil, always follow the manufacturer's recommendation.  
  <BR> <BR><P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                Gaskets</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Gaskets and seals are needed in your engine to make the machined   
   joints snug, and to prevent fluids and gasses (oil, gasoline,  
   coolant, fuel vapor, exhaust, etc.) from leaking.  
  
  <P> The cylinder head has to keep the water in the cooling system at the  
   same time as it contains the combustion pressure. Gaskets made of  
   steel, copper and asbestos are used between the cylinder head and  
   engine block. Because the engine expands and contracts with heating  
   and cooling, it is easy for joints to leak, so the gaskets have to be  
   soft and "springy" enough to adapt to expansion and contraction. They  
   also have to make up for any irregularities in the connecting parts.  <BR> <BR> 
 <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Four-stroke Piston Cycle</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> In 1876, a German engineer named Dr. Otto produced an engine, that  
   worked, using the four-stroke, or Otto cycle. "Four-stroke" refers to  
   the number of piston strokes required to complete a cycle (a cycle  
   being a sequence of constantly repeated operations). It takes two  
   complete revolutions of the crankshaft to complete the cycle.  
  
  <P>  The first stroke is the intake stroke. The piston moves down the   
   cylinder and creates a partial vacuum in the cylinder. A mixture of   
   air and fuel is forced through the inlet valve into the cylinder by   
   atmospheric pressure, now greater than the pressure in the cylinder.  
   During this stroke, the exhaust valve stays closed.  
  
  <P>  The second stroke is the compression stroke. The piston moves up in   
   the cylinder with both valves closed. The air and fuel mixture is   
   compressed and the pressure rises.  
  
  <P>  The third stroke is the power stroke. Near the end of the compression  
   stroke, the air and fuel mixture is ignited by an electric spark from  
   the spark plug. The combustion that occurs causes a rise in   
   temperature and enough pressure to force the piston down again.  
  
  <P>  Finally, on the fourth stroke, or exhaust stroke, the piston moves up  
   again and forces the burned gases out of the cylinder and into the  
   exhaust system. This cycle repeats itself the entire time the engine  
   is running.  <BR> <BR> 
  
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>                         Engine Configurations</B></FONT> </CENTER><BR> <BR> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>V-Type Engines</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The V-type of engine has two rows of cylinders at (usually) a ninety  
   degree angle to each other. Its advantages are its short length, the  
   great rigidity of the block, its heavy crankshaft, and attractive low  
   profile (for a car with a low hood). This type of engine lends itself  
   to very high compression ratios without block distortion under load,  
   resistance to torsional vibration, and a shorter car length without  
   losing passenger room.  
  
   <P> In 1914, Cadillac was the first company in the United States to use a  
   V-8 engine in its cars.  
  
  <P>  In-line engines have the cylinders arranged, one after the other, in  
   a straight line. In a vertical position, the number of cylinders used  
   is usually either four or six, but three cylinder cars are becoming   
   more common.   
  
    <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Rotary Engine</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The rotary, or Wankel, engine has no piston, it uses rotors instead  
   (usually two). This engine is small, compact and has a curved, oblong  
   inner shape (known as an "epitrochoid" curve). Its central rotor  
   turns in one direction only, but it produces all four strokes  
   (intake, compression, power and exhaust) effectively.  
  
   <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Flat (Horizontal-Opposed) Engines</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> A horizontal-opposed engine is like a V-type engine that has been   
   flattened until both banks lie in a horizontal plane. It is ideal for  
   installations where vertical space is limited, because it has a very  
   low height.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Overhead Camshaft (OHC)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
    <P>Some engines have the camshaft mounted above, or over, the cylinder  
   head instead of inside the block (OHC "overhead camshaft" engines).  
   This arrangement has the advantage of eliminating the added weight of  
   the rocker arms and push rods; this weight can sometimes make the  
   valves "float" when you are moving at high speeds. The rocker arm  
   setup is operated by the camshaft lobe rubbing directly on the  
   rocker. Stem to rocker clearance is maintained with a hydraulic valve  
   lash adjuster for "zero" clearance.  
  
   <P> The overhead camshaft is also something that we think of as a   
   relatively new development, but it's not. In 1898 the Wilkinson Motor  
   Car Company introduced the same feature on a car.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                    Double Overhead Camshaft(DOHC)</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P> The double overhead cam shaft (DOHC) is the same as the overhead   
   camshaft, except that there are two camshafts instead of one.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Overhead Valve (OHV)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> In an overhead valve (OHV) engine, the valves are mounted in the  
   cylinder head, above the combustion chamber. Usually this type of  
   engine has the camshaft mounted in the cylinder block, and the valves  
   are opened and closed by push rods.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Multivalve Engines</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> All engines have more than one valve; "multivalve" refers to the fact  
   that this type of engine has more than one exhaust or intake valve  
   per cylinder.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                                Timing</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Timing refers to the delivery of the ignition spark, or the opening   
   and closing of the engine valves, depending on the piston's position,  
   for the power stroke. The timing chain is driven by a sprocket on the  
   crankshaft and also drives the camshaft sprocket.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                    Vacuum System (Importance of)  
</B></FONT></CENTER>
   <P> Engines run on a vacuum system. A vacuum exists in an area where the  
   pressure is lower than the atmosphere outside of it. Reducing the  
   pressure inside of something causes suction. For example, when you  
   drink soda through a straw, the atmospheric pressure in the air   
   pushes down on your soda and pushes it up into your mouth. The same  
   principal applies to your engine. When the piston travels down in the  
   cylinder it lowers the atmospheric pressure in the cylinder and forms  
   a vacuum. This vacuum is used to draw in the air and fuel mixture for  
   combustion. The vacuum created in your engine not only pulls the fuel  
   into the combustion chamber, it also serves many other functions. The  
   running engine causes the carburetor and the intake manifold to  
   produce "vacuum power," which is harnessed for the operation of  
   several other devices.  
  
  <P>  Vacuum is used in the ignition-distributor vacuum-advance mechanism.  
   At part throttle, the vacuum causes the spark to give thinner  
   mixtures more time to burn.  
  
   <P> The positive crankcase ventilating system (PCV) uses the vacuum to  
   remove vapor and exhaust gases from the crankcase.  
  
  <P>  The vapor recovery system uses the vacuum to trap fuel from the   
   carburetor float bowl and fuel tank in a canister. Starting the   
   engine causes the vacuum port in the canister to pull fresh air into  
   the canister to clean out the trapped fuel vapor.  
  
  <P>  Vacuum from the intake manifold creates the heated air system that   
   helps to warm up your carburetor when it's cold.  
  
   <P> The EGR valve (exhaust-gas recirculation system) works, because of   
   vacuum, to reduce pollutants produced by the engine.  
  
  <P>  Many air conditioning systems use the vacuum from the intake manifold  
   to open and close air-conditioner doors to produce the heated air and  
   cooled air required inside your vehicle.  
  
   <P> Intake manifold vacuum also is used for the braking effort in power   
   brakes. When you push the brake pedal down, a valve lets the vacuum   
   into one section of the power-brake unit. The atmospheric pressure   
   moves a piston or diaphragm to provide the braking action.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                     Cylinder Block and Crankcase</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The engine cylinder block, or "block" is cast in one piece. Usually,  
   this is the largest and most intricate single piece of metal in the  
   automobile. Even when the cylinders, cylinder heads, or cylinder  
   sleeves are separate pieces, the crankcase is still the largest  
   single part in the engine. Almost all of the engine parts are  
   attached to the crankcase, directly or indirectly.   
  
  <P>  The crankcase houses the crankshaft and often the camshaft as well.  
   With the oil pan, which goes on the lower surface of the crankcase,  
   it forms an oil-tight housing in which the rotating and reciprocating  
   parts operate. The cylinder block is laced with coolant passages,  
   called the "water jacket". The cylinder block is usually made of high  
   grade cast iron with alloys to improve wear of the cylinders, but  
   many are aluminum. Plastic blocks have been developed but are not yet  
   used in production cars. This major unit must be extremely strong and  
   rigid to avoid bending and stretching. It also varies in thickness  
   and does not always cool uniformly to prevent warpage by internal  
   stresses of the cylinder bores.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                 Harmonic Balancer (Vibration Damper)</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The harmonic balancer, or vibration damper, is a device connected to  
   the crankshaft to lessen the torsional vibration. When the cylinders  
   fire, power gets transmitted through the crankshaft. The front of the  
   crankshaft takes the brunt of this power, so it often moves before  
   the rear of the crankshaft. This causes a twisting motion. Then, when  
   the power is removed from the front, the halfway twisted shaft  
   unwinds and snaps back in the opposite direction.  Although this  
   unwinding process is quite small, it causes "torsional vibration." To  
   prevent this vibration, a harmonic balancer is attached to the front  
   part of the crankshaft that's causing all the trouble. The balancer  
   is made of two pieces connected by rubber plugs, spring loaded  
   friction discs, or both.  
  
   <P> When the power from the cylinder hits the front of the crankshaft, it  
   tries to twist the heavy part of the damper, but ends up twisting the  
   rubber or discs connecting the two parts of the damper. The front of  
   the crank can't speed up as much with the damper attached; the force  
   is used to twist the rubber and speed up the damper wheel. This keeps  
   the crankshaft operation calm.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Crankshaft</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The crankshaft converts the up and down (reciprocating) motion of the  
   pistons into a turning (rotary) motion. It provides the turning  
   motion for the wheels. It works much like the pedals of a bicycle,   
   converting up-down motion into rotational motion.  
  
  <P>  The crankshaft is usually either alloy steel or cast iron. The   
   crankshaft is connected to the pistons by the connecting-rods.  
  
   <P> Some parts of the shaft do not move up and down; they rotate in the  
   stationary main bearings. These parts are known as journals.  There  
   are usually three journals in a four cylinder engine.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Main Bearings</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The crankshaft is held in place by a series of main bearings. The   
   largest number of main bearings a crankshaft can have is one more   
   than the number of cylinders, but it can have one less bearing than  
   the number of cylinders.  
  
   <P> Not only do the bearings support the crankshaft, but one bearing must  
   control the forward-backward movement of the crankshaft. This bearing  
   rubs against a ground surface of the main journal, and is called the  
   "thrust bearing."  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Connecting Rod</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The connecting rod links the piston to the crankshaft. The upper end  
   has a hole in it for the piston wrist pin and the lower end (big  
   end) attaches to the crankshaft.  
  
  <P>  Connecting rods are usually made of alloy steel, although some are  
   made of aluminum.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                       Connecting Rod Bearings</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Connecting rod bearings are inserts that fit into the connecting   
   rod's lower end and ride on the journals of the crankshaft.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Oil Pump</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The oil pump is used to force pressurized oil to the various parts of  
   the engine.   
  
   <P> Gear and rotary pumps are the most common types of pumps. The gear  
   pump consists of a driven spur gear and a driving gear that is  
   attached to a shaft driven by the camshaft. The two gears are the   
   same size and fit snugly in the pump body. Oil is carried from the   
   inlet to the delivery side of the pump by the opposite teeth of both   
   gears. Here it is forced into the delivery pipe. It can't flow back,   
   because the space between the meshing gear teeth is too tight.  
  
   <P> The rotary pump is driven by the camshaft. The inner rotor is shaped  
   like a cross with rounded points that fit into the star shape of the  
   outer rotor. The inner rotor is driven by a shaft turned by the  
   camshaft. When it turns, its rounded points "walk" around the star  
   shaped outer rotor and force the oil out to the delivery pipe.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Piston Motion/Bicycle</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The pistons in your engine's cylinder are similar to your legs when  
   you ride a bicycle. Think of your legs as pistons; they go up and  
   down on the pedals, providing power. The pedals are like the  
   connecting rods; they are "attached" to your legs. The pedals are  
   attached to the bicycle crank, which is like the crank shaft, because  
   it turns the wheels.  
  
   <P> To reverse this, the pistons (legs) are attached to the connecting  
   rods (pedals) which are attached to the crankshaft (bicycle crank).  
   The power from the combustion in the cylinders powers the piston to  
   push the connecting rods to turn the crankshaft.  
  
  <P>  The bicycle played a large part in the process of inventing the   
   automobile; in fact, in 1896, the first car that Henry Ford produced  
   was even called a "Quadricycle."

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                             Engine Placement</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
   <P> Mid-engine sports coupes have the engine mounted in front of the rear  
   axle. Passenger space is limited to two people. Concentrating the  
   weight in the center of the car improves handling.  
  
   <P> The conventional sports coupe's engine is in the front of the car,  
   driving either the front or rear wheels. This layout reduces   
   production costs, but luggage space and rear seat room are sacrificed  
   for the sporty styling.  
  
   <P> Vans have engines located in either the front or the rear.  
   Contemporary sedans have the engine in the front driving the front or  
   rear axle.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                                 Cylinder</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  A cylinder is a round hole through the block, bored to receive a  
   piston. All automobile engines, whether water-cooled or air-cooled,  
   four cycle or two cycle, have more than one cylinder. These multiple  
   cylinders are arranged in-line, opposed, or in a V. Engines for other  
   purposes, such as aviation, are arranged in other assorted forms.   
  
  <P>  The first four cylinder engine with a sliding transmission was in the  
   1907 Buick.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Rotary Engine</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P>  One alternative to conventional automobile power is the rotary (or  
   Wankel) engine. Although it is widely known that Felix Wankel built a  
   rotary engine in 1955, it is also a fact that Elwood Haynes made one   
   in 1893!  
  
  <P>  Dispensing with separate cylinders, pistons, valves and crankshaft,  
   the rotary engine applies power directly to the transmission. Its  
   construction allows it to provide the power of a conventional engine  
   that is twice its size and weight and that has twice as many parts.  
   The Wankel burns as much as 20% more fuel than the conventional  
   engine and is potentially a high polluter, but its small size allows  
   the addition of emission-control parts more conveniently than does  
   the piston engine. The basic unit of the rotary engine is a large  
   combustion chamber in the form of a pinched oval (called an  
   epitrochoid). Within this chamber all four functions of a piston take  
   place simultaneously in the three pockets that are formed between the  
   rotor and the chamber wall. Just as the addition of cylinders  
   increases the horsepower of a piston-powered engine, so the addition  
   of combustion chambers increases the power of a rotary engine. Larger  
   cars may eventually use rotaries with three or four rotors.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                            Combustion Chamber</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The combustion chamber is where the air-fuel mixture is burned. The  
   location of the combustion chamber is the area between the top of the  
   piston at what is known as TDC (top dead center) and the cylinder  
   head. TDC is the piston's position when it has reached the top of the  
   cylinder, and the center line of the connecting rod is parallel to   
   the cylinder walls.  
  
   <P> The two most commonly used types of combustion chamber are the   
   hemispherical and the wedge shape combustion chambers.  
  
   <P> The hemispherical type is so named because it resembles a hemisphere.  
   It is compact and allows high compression with a minimum of   
   detonation. The valves are placed on two planes, enabling the use of   
   larger valves. This improves "breathing" in the combustion chamber.   
   This type of chamber loses a little less heat than other types.   
   Because the hemispherical combustion chamber is so efficient, it is   
   often used, even though it costs more to produce.  
  
   <P> The wedge type combustion chamber resembles a wedge in shape. It is   
   part of the cylinder head. It is also very efficient, and more easily  
   and cheaply produced than the hemispherical type.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Intake Stroke</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P> The first stroke is the intake stroke. The piston moves down the   
   cylinder and creates a partial vacuum in the cylinder. A mixture of   
   air and fuel is forced through the inlet valve into the cylinder by   
   atmospheric pressure, now greater than the pressure in the cylinder.   
   During this stroke, the exhaust valve stays closed.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                          Compression Stroke</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The second stroke is the compression stroke. The piston moves up in   
   the cylinder with both valves closed. The air and fuel mixture is   
   compressed and the pressure rises.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Power Stroke</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
    <P>The third stroke is the power stroke. Near the end of the compression  
   stroke, the air and fuel mixture is ignited by an electric spark from  
   the spark plug. The combustion that occurs causes a rise in   
   temperature and enough pressure to force the piston down again.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Exhaust Stroke</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  On the fourth stroke, or exhaust stroke, the piston moves up again   
   and forces the burned gases out of the cylinder and into the exhaust   
   system.  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Valve Lifter (Tappet)</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
   <P> The valve lifter is the unit that makes contact with the valve stem   
   and the camshaft. It rides on the camshaft. When the cam lobes push   
   it upwards, it opens the valve.  
  
   <P> The engine oil comes into the lifter body under pressure. It passes   
   through a little opening at the bottom of an inner piston to a cavity  
   underneath the piston. The oil forces the piston upward until it  
   contacts the push rod. When the cam raises the valve lifter, the   
   pressure is placed on the inner piston which tries to push the oil   
   back through the little opening. It can't do this, because the   
   opening is sealed by a small check valve.  
  
  <P>  When the cam goes upward, the lifter solidifies and lifts the valve.   
   Then, when the cam goes down, the lifter is pushed down by the push   
   rod. It adjusts automatically to remove clearances.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Lifter Body</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P> The valve lifter body houses the valve lifter mechanism. The valve  
   lifter is the unit that makes contact with the valve stem and the  
   camshaft. It rides on the camshaft. When the cam lobes push it   
   upwards, it opens the valve.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Valve Cover</B></FONT> </CENTER>  
  <P>  The valve cover covers the valve train. The valve train consists of   
   rocker arms, valve springs, push rods, lifters and cam (in an   
   overhead cam engine). The valve cover can be removed to adjust the   
   valves. Oil is pumped up through the pushrods and dispersed   
   underneath the valve cover, which keeps the rocker arms lubricated.   
   Holes are located in various places in the engine head so that the   
   oil recirculates back down to the oil pan. For this reason, the valve  
   cover must be oil-tight; it is often the source of oil leaks.  
  
  <P>  The valve cover is often distorted on older cars, because at some   
   point the valve cover screws were over-tightened, bending the valve   
   cover. This happens because the valve cover is made of very thin   
   sheet metal and cannot withstand the force of an over-tightened bolt.  
  
   <P> One way to determine if your valve cover is bent is to remove the   
   gasket and put the valve cover back on to the cylinder head. When the  
   valve cover and cylinder head come into contact, the cover should sit  
   flat. If it rocks, it is bent. Cast aluminum valve covers cannot be  
   straightened, they need to be replaced. Sheet metal valve covers can  
   be straightened.  
  
   <P> A symptom of a bent or leaking valve cover is a pinching of the valve  
   cover gasket. This means that the gasket is sealing one area and not  
   sealing another area. This condition produces a leak; oil could be  
   leaking down the side of the engine. Some valve covers are hard to  
   access, because they are covered with other engine parts.  
  
   <P> Chronic valve cover leakage can sometimes be fixed by using two  
   gaskets glued together instead of using just one.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Wankel Rotor</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The rotor within a rotary engine consists of three basic parts. One  
   is the rotor itself which has cavities in it that serve as   
   compression chambers. The second part consists of seals; these are   
   strips of metal mounted at each point of the rotor. The third  
   principal component of the rotor is the ring gear. The ring gear  
   engages the fixed gear that is mounted to the side of the engine   
   block. Since the fixed gear and the ring gear are engaged as the   
   rotor rotates, a flip-flopping motion of the rotor (much like a   
   hula-hoop) is caused as it goes around the fixed gear.  
  
   <P> Within the rotor is the eccentric shaft that turns independently of  
   both the rotor and the fixed gear. This serves basically the same  
   purpose as the crankshaft of an engine, and it works in much the same  
   way. As the rotor is flipped around the fixed gear, it turns the  
   eccentric shaft at half the rotor's rotating speed. Due to the  
   imperfect nature of the seals on the rotor as compared to the rings  
   on a piston engine, rotary engines tend to pollute more than piston  
   engines. However, with the development of new seal technology,  
   improvements are being made in this area.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Oil Seals</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Oil seals are rubber and metal composite items. They are generally   
   mounted at the end of shafts. They are used to keep fluids, such as  
   oil, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid inside the object  
   they are sealing. These seals flex to hold a tight fit around the  
   shaft that comes out of the housing, and don't allow any fluid to  
   pass. Oil seals are common points of leakage and can usually be  
   replaced fairly inexpensively. However, the placement of some seals  
   make them very difficult to access, which makes for a hefty labor  
   charge!  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Engine Oil Dip Stick</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  The engine oil dip stick is a long metal rod that goes into the oil   
   sump. The purpose of the dip stick is to check how much oil is in the  
   engine.  
  
   <P> The dip stick is held in a tube; the end of the tube extends into the  
   oil sump. It has measurement markings on it. If you pull it out, you  
   can see whether you have enough oil, or whether you need more by the  
   level of oil on the markings.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                            Oil Filler Cap</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> The oil filler cap is a plastic or metal cap that covers an opening   
   into the valve cover. It allows you to add oil when the dipstick  
   indicates that you need it. Some cars have the crankcase vented  
   through the filler cap. Oil which is added through the filler passes  
   down through openings in the head into the oil sump at the bottom of  
   the engine.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                              Oil Filter</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
  <P>  Oil filters are placed in the engine's oil system to strain dirt and   
   abrasive materials out of the oil.   
  
   <P> The oil filter cannot remove things that dilute the oil, such as   
   gasoline and acids. Removing the solid material does help cut down on  
   the possibility of acids forming. Removing the "grit" reduces the wear  
   on the engine parts.  
  
  <P>  Modern passenger car engines use the "full flow" type of oil filters.  
   With this type of filter, all of the oil passes through the filter   
   before it reaches the engine bearings. If a filter becomes clogged, a  
   bypass valve allows oil to continue to reach the bearings. The most   
   common type of oil filter is a cartridge type. Oil filters are   
   disposable; at prescribed intervals, this filter is removed, replaced  
   and thrown away.  Most states now require that oil filters be drained  
   completely before disposal, which adds to the cost of an oil change,  
   but helps to reduce pollution.  
  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Oil Passages</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> Within the engine is a variety of pathways for oil to be sent to  
   moving parts.  These pathways are designed to deliver the same  
   pressure of fresh lubricating oil to all parts.  If the pathways  
   become clogged, the affected parts will lock together. This usually  
   destroys parts that are not lubricated, and often ruins the entire   
   engine.  
  
   <P> The oil passages are cleverly drilled into the connecting parts of  
   the engine, which allows the highly mobile ones (like the pistons) to  
   have ample lubrication. Originating at the oil pump, they flow  
   through all of the major components of the engine.  In the case of  
   the pistons and rods, the passages are designed to open each time the  
   holes in the crankshaft and rods align.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                               Oil Pan</B></FONT> </CENTER>
  
   <P> At the bottom of the crankcase is the container containing the  
   lifeblood of the engine.  Usually constructed of thin steel, it  
   collects the oil as it flows down from the sides of the crankcase.   
   The pan is shaped into a deeper section, where the oil pump is  
   located. At the bottom of the pan is the drain plug, which is used to  
   drain the oil. The plug is often made with a magnet in it, which  
   collects metal fragments from the oil.  
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                           Serpentine Belts</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
   <P> A recent development is the serpentine belt, so named because they  
   wind around all of the pulleys driven by the crankshaft pulley. This  
   design saves space, but if it breaks, everything it drives comes to a  
   stop.   
  
  <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                        Cutaway of the V-8 Engine</B></FONT> </CENTER>
   <P> This diagram shows the flow of fuel and exhaust within a V8 engine. It  
   shows the timing chain (driven by the crankshaft) drives the camshaft,  
   which opens the valves. Fuel enters the cylinders via the intake  
   manifold. The spark-caused explosions force the pistons down.  Rotation  
   of the crank forces the pistons back up, which expels the exhaust.  
 <BR> <BR> 
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                     The Engine's Lubrication System</B></FONT> </CENTER>

  <P> This animation shows the route taken by the oil within an engine. The oil  
   pump draws oil from the oil pan, then forces it through the filter, into  
   the crankshaft passage, through the connecting rods to the pistons and  
   rings. Oil is pushed through the lifters and pushrods, and covers the  
   rocker arms. It then flows back down into the pan to complete the cycle.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Automobiles in History</B></FONT> </CENTER> <BR> 
                       
  
 <P>  In the annuals of history, the automobile flashed onto the scene like  
   a meteor, changing the entire economy and the national way-of-life.  
   No one was really prepared for it. Generations of horse-drawn road  
   transportation had created a complex system of industries on which  
   the automobile had a damaging effect; everybody from horse doctors  
   and harness-makers to blacksmiths. The continuing changes and the  
   reasons for them are obvious to us, but probably were not so obvious  
   to automotive pioneers. It was, after all, a learn-as-you-go process  
   with no precedents. For every inventor who made a fortune, hundreds  
   had their dreams crumble. Automobiles have ended the isolation of  
   rural communities and set an example of industrial efficiency for the  
   world to copy. It has also spoiled the cities and small towns as  
   neighborhoods are obliterated by highways smashing through; it has  
   polluted the environment, and caused shortages in natural resources.  
   Yet the car itself is still the object of endless fascination.

 <P>  In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt said he had ridden in a car  
   only twice in his life and that was quite enough. His chauffeur had  
   been stopped by a policeman on his second ride, going at the  
   outrageous speed of ten mile per hour. Roosevelt declared he would  
   never ride in a car again. He later became the first President to own  
   a car and the first to drive one.  The nation`s first speeder, by the  
   way, was arrested in 1899 by a New York policeman riding a bicycle.  
   The speeder was whizzing along at an amazing twelve miles per hour!  
  
   <P>In 1907, five years before becoming President of the United States,  
   Woodrow Wilson warned the American citizens that the motorcar would  
   "spread socialist feelings in this country." He, like Roosevelt, was  
   forced to eat his words and think twice before he condemned anything  
   again. In 1919, he bought a Model T Ford.  
  
  <P> In 1908, a U.S. Army study predicted that the automobile was unsuited  
   for war. During World War I, however, the Allies commandeered all the  
   taxis in Paris to rush their troops to the front lines, halting the  
   German Army at the Marne. Meanwhile, in spite of their predictions,  
   the Army was buying some cars for the brass, refusing to pay the  
   state of New York a $2.00 license fee on the grounds that the U.S.  
   Government was immune from taxation.  
  
 <P>  Hiram Johnson was the first political candidate to put his campaign  
   on motorized wheels in 1910. He drove his way right into the  
   governor's mansion in California by covering the state in a car.  
  
 <P>  Nearly every member of the Russian royal family had a Rolls-Royce.  
   Czar Nicholas II had a matched pair of Rolls-Royce Silver Ghosts.  
   Prince Feliks Yussupov, the Czar's nephew, owned a Silver Ghost which  
   became part of history.  
  
   <P>Grigori Yefimovich Novykh, known as "Rasputin," arrived in St.  
   Petersburg from Siberia about 1906. Rasputin means "debauched," an  
   appropriate name for one who believes that salvation can only be  
   gained by sinning. In spite of his amorality, Rasputin claimed to be  
   a holy man with the power to heal. By superstition of the times and  
   manipulation, he was able to accomplish improved health for several  
   of the afflicted who came to him for help. Czarina Alexandra  
   Feodorovna, whose son had hemophilia, in desperation to save the  
   royal heir, sent for Rasputin after the court physicians had failed  
   to help him. Rasputin held some emotional and mystic sessions with  
   the boy and convinced Alexandra that he had cured him. Alexandra then  
   turned to him more and more for advice concerning personal and even  
   public matters. Using his hold over the Czarina, he gained influence  
   over Czar Nicholas' decisions on affairs of state.  
  
  <P> Prince Yussupov was alarmed by Rasputin's meddling and conspired with  
   four government officials who felt the same to do away with Rasputin.  
   On December 29, 1916, these conspirators lured him to Moika Palace  
   and fed him wine and cakes laced with cyanide. The poison either had  
   no effect or took longer than the party could stand, so Yussupov shot  
   him several times to shorten his suffering. They carried the body of  
   Rasputin, bleeding but still alive, to Yussupov's Rolls-Royce, first  
   wrapping him so that he would not stain the upholstery. Driving to  
   the banks of the frozen Neva River, they dragged him from the car and  
   dropped him through a hole in the ice. Rasputin went out in grand  
   style: sitting on the back seat of a Rolls-Royce, which was driven by  
   a prince of the realm.  
  
   <P>A year and a half later, the entire royal family was dead, murdered  
   during the Communist Revolution. Lenin, the father of Communism,  
   owned the very symbol of Capitalism, a Rolls-Royce. The fate of  
   Yussupov's Rolls-Royce is unknown, but Lenin's is in the Moscow  
   museum. That makes two Rolls-Royce automobiles in Russia at the  
   present time, since the British Ambassador drives one. If you are  
   interested in owning one of the grandest of the grand, the makers of  
   Rolls have an elongated Silver Spur limousine on sale for only  
   $185,000.  
  
  <P> Another automobile which played a major part in history is the  
   Mercedes, which really doesn't seem to be a good token for political  
   leaders.  
  
  <P> Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm had a chauffeur-driven Mercedes with an  
   imperial eagle on the hood; World War I took away not only his  
   handsome automobile, but also his empire. One war later, Adolph  
   Hitler rode to defeat in a Mercedes limousine. Hitler had been so  
   proud of his country's automobile that in 1939, when Nazi Germany and  
   the Soviet Union signed their pact of non aggression, which neither  
   nation honored, he gave a supercharged sports Mercedes roadster with  
   a rumble seat to his good friend, Joseph Stalin. After Stalin died,  
   his son sold the Mercedes to a Swede who later sold it to a man in  
   Arizona. The Arizonan later offered it for the sale price of $775,000  
   but said he could be talked down to a measly $700,000.  
  
 <P>  Shortly after Hitler killed himself (and then swam to South America),  
   the chancellor of the new German Federal Republic, Mercedes-borne  
   Konrad Adenauer, watched his country split in half. Emperor Hirohito  
   of Japan also owned a red and black Mercedes before he came in last  
   during WWII.  
  
  <P> The Mercedes is especially popular among the political elite in  
   Africa, which the Swahili call "wabenzi," or men of "Mercedes-Benz."  
   The Central African Republic's Emperor, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, was one  
   such wabenzi, who had his country and his entire Mercedes fleet taken  
   in a 1979 coup. Six years later, the wabenzi of Nigeria, President  
   Alhaji Shihu Shagari, lost his office and impressive car in the same  
   way.  
  
  <P> A group of middle-aged women in Togo fared much better than the men.  
   Some decades ago, these ladies made night visits into Ghana to  
   smuggle that country's fine cloth into Togo. Subsequently, they  
   gained control over Togo's entire textile market, branching out into  
   legal commercial enterprises and becoming millionaires many times  
   over. They drive around Togo in their Mercedes limousines to check up  
   on real estate holdings, restaurants, grocery stores, and various  
   other ventures. When the Togolese President discovered that he did  
   not have enough VIP vehicles to receive his visitors while hosting a  
   conference of the African heads of state, he sent out a call for help  
   to the "Mercedes Ladies." In a few hours, a whole procession of  
   gleaming Mercedes automobiles drove up to assist the President.  
  
  <P> Clyde Champion Barrow, of Bonnie and Clyde fame, wrote a letter to  
   Henry Ford in 1934, one month before Clyde and the cigar-smoking,  
   gun-toting Bonnie were killed in a shoot-out with the police. Clyde  
   stopped running from the federal authorities long enough to write  
   what a "dandy car" Ford made. He wrote that "...For sustained speed  
   and freedom from trouble the Ford has got every other car skinned and  
   even if my business hasn't been strictly legal it don't hurt anything  
   to tell you what a fine car you got..." In 1947, the very car that  
   Clyde had so much affection for was sold at auction. It had been  
   wrecked during the shoot-out and was bullet-ridden. Even so, it  
   brought $175,000.  
  
  <P> When Gerald Ford became Vice President in 1973, he stated, "I am a  
   Ford, not a Lincoln." Once he became President, he found himself to  
   be a Ford in a Lincoln, since the Lincoln was the official automobile  
   for the President, a tradition started by Calvin Coolidge in 1924.  
   This tradition was upheld until Ronald Reagan expressed a fondness  
   for the Cadillac.  
  
   <P>Automobiles, like wine, seem to become more costly with maturity and  
   age. An Orlando auction in 1981 brought $350,000 for a 1936 Packard  
   that had been purchased for about $2,000 when new. A 1936 Mercedes  
   brought $421,000 in Los Angeles in 1979. One auto lover in Kansas has  
   given 30,000 hours of labor to fine-tune and plate his 1920 Pierce  
   Arrow with silver and gold. This automobile is insured with Lloyd's  
   of London for $1,000,000!

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                  Automobiles in Art and Literature</B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Cars have frequently played a major role in literature. They are even  
   used at times to comment on the state of humanity. Carl Sandburg  
   wrote "Portrait of A Motorcar" in 1918 and almost twenty years later,  
   made the automobile the center of his long prose poem, "The People,  
   Yes." Joyce Carol Oates, in 1979, wrote a provocative poem entitled  
   "F---"; for Ford, of course.  
  
  <P> In 1919, Sinclair Lewis wrote whimsically of his adventures in a  
   Model T. Six years later, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote his masterpiece,  
   "The Great Gatsby," portraying the cynicism of post-World War I by  
   the use of Gatsby's cream-colored Rolls-Royce.  In 1962, William  
   Faulkner wrote humorously about human frailties against the backdrop  
   of an early Winton Flyer automobile in his literary classic, "The  
   Reivers." Some poets and novelists were drawn to the car culture, but  
   others were depressed by it. Either way, the automobile was the hub  
   of human commentary for a long list of writers.  
  
   <P>Even more than writers, composers of popular music are attracted to  
   cars. They jumped in almost as soon as the first car drove past and  
   have never gotten off. Many of the songs are sexually oriented.  
   Titles include "In My Merry Oldsmobile," "On The Back Seat of A Henry  
   Ford," "Tumble in A Rumble Seat," "Keep Away from The Fellow Who Owns  
   an Automobile," up to the contemporary songs such as "Maybelline,"  
   "Mustang Sally," "Little Deuce Coupe," "Pull up to The Bumper," and  
   "Little Red Corvette." Trucking songs, such as "King of The Road,"  
   "On the Road Again," and others too numerous to mention are immensely  
   popular.   
  
  <P> The Los Angeles Music Center and Museum of Contemporary Art  
   commissioned several playwrights to create original ten-minute  
   scripts to be acted out in automobiles. The film industry has relied  
   heavily on the automobile, ranging from the humorous "The Long, Long  
   Trailer" and "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" to "Bonnie and Clyde"  
   and hundreds of chase scenes. Television made the automobile the very  
   star of the show in "My Mother, The Car" and "The Knight Rider," in  
   which "Kit" is smarter than any of the rest of the cast.  
  
  <P> Artists followed Toulouse-Lautrec's lead from his 1896 lithograph,  
   "The Motorist," to take up brushes and portray the essence of the  
   automobile. Some used their brushes in cartoon fashion to show it as  
   a toy of the idle rich. Some saw it as a symbol of mankind's dynamism  
   and vitality. Andy Warhol, who saw art in a Campbell soup can,  
   painted a series devoted to gruesome car wrecks. Other artists see  
   the automobile as a graceful, flowing form of man-made beauty, an art  
   in itself.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Those Women Drivers! </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  The first "chauffeuse," or woman driver to appear in public was Miss  
   Daisy Post, a niece of Mrs. Frederick Vanderbilt; she was soon joined  
   by Mrs. Herman Oelrichs and Mrs. William Vanderbilt.   
  
  <P> A Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish, with Miss Greta Pomeroy as her passenger,  
   decided to drive the "machine" around the grounds. She meant to stay  
   close to the drives and sidewalks, but instead, ran into a stone  
   wall. The wall fell down and the car proceeded, tearing out a clump  
   of choice shrubbery and finally smashing into the steps of the house.  
   At this point, the car finally stopped and the whole side of the  
   automobile gave way and fell off. Mrs. Fish may have been the  
   originator of the male expression, "woman driver." Of course, many  
   male drivers fared no better than Mrs. Fish on their first try - and  
   many did worse. There were many instances recorded of panic-stricken  
   men losing control of their vehicles and shouting, "Whoa! Whoa!"  
  
  <P> Miss Anne Rainsford French of Washington, D.C., whose father was a  
   noted physician in the capital city, was awarded her "Steam  
   Engineeer's License, Locomobile Class," on March 22, 1900. She was  
   one of the earliest licensed women drivers in the United States. Mrs.  
   John Howell Phillips of Chicago is said to have been licensed two  
   months prior to Miss French, however. In the same year, 13-year-old  
   Jeanette Lindstrom received license No. 322 and it was claimed that  
   she had already been driving for two years.  
  
  <P> Mrs. Mary Landon was the entire office staff of the Haynes-Apperson  
   Automobile Company. In 1899, she read the instruction sheet put out  
   with each of the vehicles and proceeded to drive one of the firm's  
   automobiles across town to the factory. Upon her arrival there, Elmer  
   Apperson exclaimed, "Well, I'll be damned!"  
  
 <P>  Mrs. Newton J. Cuneo of New York was the only woman driver in the  
   first Glidden Tour in 1905. She was driving smoothly along when  
   another car stalled in front of her on a narrow bridge. Unable to  
   apply the brakes in time, she rear-ended the other car and tipped her  
   own into the creek.  
  
 <P>  In 1909, Mrs. Alice Ramsey and three women companions (Nettie Powell,  
   Margaret Atwood, and Miss Hermine Johns) drove a Maxwell touring car  
   from New York City to San Francisco in fifty-three days. They proved  
   themselves capable of keeping their car in operation, changing tires  
   and finding their way on unmarked roads. Their biggest problem was  
   that each had only one suitcase for the entire journey. The Maxwell  
   Company hired an advance man, John D. Murphy, to precede the ladies  
   and make necessary hotel accommodations and check on the gasoline  
   supply for their extra-large twenty-gallon tank.  
  
 <P> The ladies added a new dimension to motoring. Dusters, scarves,  
   veils, hats, and gauntlet-style gloves were a must of the female  
   driver. Before windshield wipers became standard equipment, goggles  
   had to be part of the attire. Some wore large face-covering bonnets,  
   like bee-keepers hats, with a glass window to see through, or they  
   carried tiny hand-windshields, which they held in front of their  
   faces to keep dust and bugs out of their eyes.  
  
  <P> Queen Victoria, of England, had died in 1901, and gradually the  
   symbols of her moralistic influence began to fade. Equal rights  
   became a reality, and the automobile played an influencing role in  
   the change. The status of the weaker sex was improved, and the slogan  
   of the Pullman auto - made in New York, Pennsylvania - had a special  
   meaning for women: "Tailored for Her Majesty, the American Woman."  
  
  <P> Wake! For the Car that scatters into flights  
   The Hens before it in a flapping Fright,  
   Drives straight up to your Door, and   
   bids you Come  
   Out for a Morning Hour of Sheer Delight.  
  
 <P>  We are no other than a Moving Row  
   Of Automobile Cranks that come and go.  
   And what with Goggles and  
   Talc-windowed Veils,  
   In Motoring Get-up, we're a Holy Show!

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        How Cars Are Assembled </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Ford's revolutionary concept of the assembly line to make cars  
   included a rope which pulled a line of chassis along a track, at  
   which stood fifty workers, each fixing their own allotted part to  
   each chassis as it moved by. Assembly time for a chassis dropped from  
   twelve to one and a half hours. In less than ten years, the price of  
   a Model T dropped from $850 to $250. Ford sold 1.8 million Model T  
   cars. In 1951, Ford led the way in using automatic equipment to  
   produce engine blocks.   
  
  <P> The urge to save labor has continued to inspire new developments,  
   with robots replacing workers, cutting out tedious tasks and  
   guaranteeing greater accuracy. On the Fiat Uno, 30 of the 2700 welds  
   are done by hand. Only specialized crafts, such as electrical wiring,  
   now remain in human hands.  
  
  <P> In a typical car assembly in the 1980s, the first stage was sheet  
   steel arriving at the press shop. In areas as large as three football  
   stadiums, robot cranes supplied rolled sheets of steel to giant  
   stamping machines, which cut the pieces of metal to make up the car  
   body. Then robots built the underbody or floorpan, making numerous  
   welds and creating a complex shape with spaces for wheel arches, boot  
   wells and spare wheels.  
  
  <P> In the next stage, large jigs positioned the body sides and roof to  
   be welded into place automatically. In the meantime, the doors had  
   been made on nearby assembly lines in a process that involved several  
   different pressings to create an outer skin clinched over an inner  
   frame. Finally, lasers checked every car body for the smallest flaw,  
   distortion or irregularity.  
  
  <P> The car, now largely assembled, was cleaned in a degreasing tank,  
   rinsed and coated with phosphate to make it more receptive to the  
   paint. After further rinses, base primer coat was applied, in several  
   layers. These primer coats were sprayed on electrostatically, using  
   an electric field to attract the paint. The last layers, usually  
   three, were glossy acrylic paint. The paintwork on most mass-produced  
   cars is 0.1mm thick; although on a Rolls-Royce, there are 22 layers  
   of paint, giving a thickness of 0.2mm. Special wax was then applied  
   to protect against water, snow, grit and salt. This was injected into  
   hollow sections such as pillars and sills.  
  
  <P> The next stage, the trim, fitted out the interior. The car was wired  
   with its electrical system. Robots fitted underfelt, carpets, seats  
   and other fittings. Windscreen and some other windows were often  
   glued to the car to make a better fit and reduce wind resistance and  
   noise.  Robots applied the glue to the edge of the glass and then put  
   it in place on the car with sucker grips.  
  
 <P>  Finally, the car was hoisted up, and a jacking system brought the  
   engine, complete with clutch and gearbox, into position. The fuel  
   tank was mounted at the rear end of the car. Next came suspension,  
   steering, radiator and battery, and then the wheels and tires. When  
   water, antifreeze, oil and gasoline were added, the car was ready to  
   run. Inspectors examined it at the gate before its final road tests.  
   When the car was given it final checks, it was ready for the dealer.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>
                           Facts about Rubbish  </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> Every year Americans throw away 250 million tons of rubbish. New York  
   alone generates almost 10 million tons a year. It has been estimated  
   that America's garbage could provide as much energy as 100 million  
   tons of coal. Unfortunately, most of it is buried and never used.  
   Recycling garbage can produce electricity, saving millions of tons of  
   coal. Rubbish can also be burned by factories instead of coal or oil,  
   but it must be treated first.   
  
 <P> For our purposes, rubbish dumped in the ground could be used as a  
   source of fuel. As garbage begins to rot, it produces methane gas,  
   which is the same as the natural gas found in pockets under the  
   earth's crust. Each ton of refuse can produce up to 14,000 cubic feet  
   (or 400 cubic meters) of methane. Left alone, the gas will find its  
   way to the surface and escape, sometimes causing explosions. But it  
   can be tapped very cheaply and used to generate heat or electricity.  
   Some plants use the gas on site to generate electricity by burning it  
   in simple gas engines. This allows all the gas to be used, rather  
   than trying to match output to the fluctuating demands of a factory.  
   In the future, gas production in rubbish may be used to fuel our  
   automobiles as an oil substitute.  
  
   <P>We should also be interested in metal waste, which could be sorted  
   out and reused after processing for car parts.   
  
  <BR> <BR> <P> 
 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        A Few Facts about Oil </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> When oil was struck in the Forties Field under the North Sea in 1969,  
   it led to the discovery of at least 350 million tons of oil. However,  
   by the year 2020, the world's known oil reserves are due to run out.  
   By then, new oil fields will need to be found, probably in more and  
   more inaccessible places. Prospectors looking for oil look for  
   sedimentary basins which could be oil-bearing, magnetic surveys and  
   gravity surveys are often used.  All rocks are magnetic, but the  
   magnetism varies slightly from one rock to another, giving geologists  
   clues to the structure and type of rocks that lie underground. Other  
   clues include the density of the rock.   
  
 <P>  When the production wells have been drilled and lined with casing, a  
   perforating gun is lowered down them to drive explosive charges  
   through the casing and cement and into the rock beyond to allow the  
   oil to get into the wells. As oil is extracted, pressure may be  
   maintained by injecting water or gas into the reservoir rock to  
   displace the oil towards the production wells.   
  
 <P>  Even with the help of modern techniques, however, such as electrical  
   and mechanical pumps, it is seldom possible to extract more than 30%  
   to 50% of the oil in a field. Perhaps a means will be found to get  
   all the oil out of a "dig." If so, millions more gallons would be  
   available out of the wells which have previously been drained "dry."

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                        Lighting City Streets </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Every day, at dusk and dawn, millions of street lights are turned on  
   and off throughout the world. Most lights are controlled by time  
   switches, which operate a group of lights in nearby streets. The  
   earliest time switches worked by clockwork and had to be wound up and  
   adjusted every week.  
  
  <P> Many modern time switches now have an electric clock with a rotating  
   dial, containing levers and tappets, which turn the lights on and off  
   at the chosen times. Since the sun rises and sets at different times  
   during the year, street lights must also go on and off at different  
   times, so these dials also alter the switching times according to the  
   season of the year. This is arranged in the time switch by a  
   mechanical device which adjusts the "On" and "Off" tappets month by  
   month to follow the changes in the hours of daylight.  
  
 <P>  Recently, engineers have developed a photoelectric control unit  
   called a "pecu," which operates a switch in the electrical supply to  
   the lights. At dawn, light falling on a photocell causes electrons to  
   flow from one atom to another, conducting electricity to the switch  
   and turning it off. When darkness falls, the electrons become  
   immobile, the current stops, and the lights are turned on. The exact  
   time that the lights go on and off will also depend upon weather  
   conditions.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Seat Belt Protection </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
  <P> A driver or passenger travelling in a car is moving at the same speed  
   as the car. If the car suddenly stops, the body of the rider inside  
   will keep moving forward at the same speed. This demonstrates inertia  
   - the tendency of a moving object to keep moving, or of a stationary  
   object to remain at rest. An inertia-reel seat belt works on the same  
   principle. Its mechanism includes a pendulum, which hangs vertically  
   under ordinary driving conditions. If the car should suddenly stop,  
   however, it swings forward, and a locking lever resting on the  
   pendulum is released. The lever engages a toothed ratchet that locks  
   the shaft around which the belt is wound. The locked seat belt then  
   prevents the body from being flung forward.  
  
   <P>When the seat belt is fastened, it winds out from the reel against  
   slight tension from a spring. This keeps it taut during normal  
   traveling, but allows enough free movement for a driver to reach  
   forward as necessary. If the driver tugs on the belt abruptly while  
   winding it out, the locking mechanism will engage and stop the action  
   of the spring. Slackening the belt releases the spring and the

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                         Tires on Racing Cars </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  Car tires are more than just cushions for the wheels. They also give  
   the car a good grip on slippery roads and keep it from sliding about  
   when braking and cornering. The tread patterns running all around the  
   tire have thin cuts in the rubber to sponge up surface water, and  
   zigzag channels to pump the water out behind as the car rolls  
   forward. On a wet road, a tire has to move more than one gallon (5  
   liters) of water a second to give needed grip.  
  
   <P>On perfectly dry roads, the treads are not needed. A smooth tire  
   gives the greatest possible area of contact with the road, but if  
   smooth tires are used on wet roads, the film of water builds up in  
   front of the tires and underneath them and actually lifts them off  
   the road surface, a condition known as "hydroplaning." In this  
   situation, the driver will lose control of the car.  
  
  <P> Most cars have to function in all types of weather, so their tires  
   must have tread, but racing cars make very few outings a year. If the  
   track is dry, they run on smooth tires, called "slicks," to get the  
   best grip on the roads. The extra wide tires and wheels give more  
   grip than the average car, but in wet weather, the racer must change  
   to treaded tires.

 <CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>                             Breath Tests </B></FONT> </CENTER> 
  
 <P>  When someone blows into a breath-test bag, any alcohol in his breath  
   is turned into acetic acid (vinegar), changing the color of the  
   crystals in the blowing tube. The more crystals that change color,  
   the more alcohol is in the body. The first breath-alcohol test was  
   developed by an American doctor, Rolla N. Harger, who called it a  
   "drunkometer."  
  
<P>  The breath-alcohol tests used by the police today, however, are  
   usually electronic, and much more accurate than the inflatable  
   plastic bag type. They use the alcohol blown in through the tube as  
   fuel to produce electric current. The more alcohol the breath  
   contains, the stronger the current. If it lights up a green light,  
   the driver is below the legal limit and has passed the test. An amber  
   light means the alcohol level is near the limit, a red light is above  
   the limit, and in both cases the driver has failed the breath test  
   and needs further testing. These tests are used to judge a driver's  
   ability to drive. A high intake of alcohol dulls the nervous system  
   and slows up coordination.  
  
  <P> The best advice concerning these are the familiar "If you drink,  
   don't drive; if you drive, don't drink!"

  <P> By 1898, American motorists had formed about fifty clubs across the  
   country. In 1902, the biggest and most enduring of these clubs was  
   founded - the American Automobile Association.   
  
 <P>  In 1900, the nation's total hard-road surface was under 40,000 miles.  
   The first mile of concrete roadway was laid in 1908, at which time  
   Kansas had 273 miles of macadam and gravel roads; Delaware had 66;  
   Nebraska, 23; and Oklahoma had none.  
  
   <P>In 1906, the Stanley Steamer clocked an unheard of speed of 127.6  
   miles an hour on the sands of Ormond Beach, Florida.  
  
  <P> On June 27, 1980, a time when the great international question of the  
   day was whether or not fifty-three American hostages held in Iran by  
   terrorists would get out alive, the top U.S. official in the hostages  
   had plans to get out. Maryland's Motor Vehicle Bureau received a  
   letter from Tehran, asking that the official's driver's license be  
   renewed before it expired. He perhaps dreamed of driving freely down  
   a New England highway when he was released and didn't want expiration  
   of his driver's license to come between him and his dream.  
  
  <P> A New Jersey couple tried to swap their fourteen-month-old son for a  
   '77 Corvette. When the police arrived, the couple were just attaching  
   their license plates on the car for which they had traded their son.  
   The infant was found crawling happily on the floor of the showroom.  
  
  <P> According to the United States Census Bureau, we spent $856 million  
   to wash our cars in 1982. This was not to smooth dents in fenders or  
   even to touch up paint jobs; it was just to run through the neighbor-  
   hood car wash. Now something new has come on the scene for a soiled  
   car: it is called "detailing." These shops started in California and  
   are spreading across the country. They wash the car, massage it with  
   lotions and creams, blow-dry it, and wipe it gently with chamois for  
   a mere $145 for the eight-hour beauty treatment.  
  
 <P>  Mrs. Selma Ghelberg applied for and received a personalized license  
   plate in Mount Vernon, New York. Her son had established "No Name" as  
   his CB "handle," and Mrs. Ghelberg therefore asked for a NO NAME tag.  
   Mrs. Ghelberg immediately began to receive dunning notices for unpaid  
   parking and speeding tickets. She had always obeyed the law and had  
   never received a ticket, so she took the notices in and explained her  
   situation at the police station. The police were very skeptical, but  
   since Mrs. Ghelberg was so adamant about her innocence, they agreed  
   to investigate.  
  
 <P>  The investigation revealed that when a policeman wrote a ticket with  
   the offender's name entered illegibly, the clerk punched "No Name"  
   into the computer. The computer in Albany automatically sent a  
   response that NO NAME was registered to Mrs. Ghelberg, and the police  
   issued her another ticket. The irony of this dilemma was that our  
   poor Mrs. Ghelberg worked for the New York State Department of Motor  
   Vehicles!

  <PRE>
   No matter how well automobiles run, people complained about this or   
   that and wanted continual improvements made. Pioneer drivers fretted   
   about pesky details such as the buttoning down of side-curtains in a   
   sudden storm; the stoking of a Clark charcoal auto heater; the   
   frustration of a broken drive-chain wrapped around a rear axle and   
   the feeble flicker of the carbide lamp on the dark country roads.   
   Something had to be done to stop all the complaining!   
  
   1600 - The Dutch employed wind power to propel sail-mounted carriages  
         which raced along at 20 mph and held scores of passengers. It   
         is quite probable that both speed and load capacity were  
         exaggerated. Later, small carriages were equipped with wind-  
         mills, the mill vanes geared to the wheels. These were probably  
         the first land vehicles to be propelled by anything other than   
         animal or human muscle power, but people complained because the  
         vehicles depended on the whim of a breeze.  
  
   1680 - Sir Isaac Newton conceived of a vehicle propelled by a "rear-  
         wardly directed jet of steam." This idea didn't evolve for use   
         in the automobile, but it was later used in rocket thrust.  
     
   1698 - Thomas Savery invented the first steam engine in Britain. It  
         was crude, inefficient, and even dangerous, since it blew up  
         quite often.  
  
   1711 - Thomas Newcomen, an English blacksmith, improved upon Savery's  
         engine.  
  
   1769 - James Watt, a Scottish instrument maker, patented a steam  
         engine that became widely used in British mines, mills, and  
         factories.  
         Nicholas Joseph Cugnot, an officer financed by the French   
         government, built a steam-propelled, 3-wheeled artillery wagon,   
         which raced along at 3 mph. In a demonstration, it went out of   
         control and ran into a wall. Most automotive historians trace   
         the beginning of the true automobile back to Cugnot's cannon.  
  
   1801 - Richard Trevithick, an engineer in Cornwall, built an  
         experimental road steamer. Two years later, he improved on his  
         invention, which was demonstrated in London and proved itself  
         to have sustained, reliable performance at its maximum speed  
         of 12 mph.  
  
   1804 - American road steamers were built by Apollo Kinsley in  
         Connecticut, Nathan Read in Massachusetts, and Oliver Evans in  
         Pennsylvania. Evans' vehicle was 30 feet long and weighed 15  
         tons. Evans had applied for a patent on a "Steam Land Carriage"   
         in 1792. He was commissioned in 1805 by the city's board of   
         health to build a versatile steam-driven dredge. He added the   
         idea that the machine also travel on land under its own power.   
         A series of belts and gears transmitted the power of the boat's   
         engine to the wagon wheels. On its first run, it clanked slowly   
         along on huge iron wheels, frightening onlookers on its way to   
         the Schuylkill River where its energy was diverted from the   
         land wheels to a paddlewheel in the stern.  
  
   1830s- Britain was providing a network of passenger and freight  
         services which were steam-powered in a handful of cities.  
  
   1831 - Michael Faraday discovered the principles of the induction  
         coil.  
  
   1839 - The first electrically-powered road vehicle is believed to  
         have been built in Scotland by Robert Anderson, but it and  
         others built in Britain in the next several years were mostly  
         unsuccessful. Around 1880, longer-lasting batteries were  
         developed, but these were cumbersome and bulky and needed  
         frequent recharging. Electric cabs, however, appeared on the  
         streets of London in the late 1800s.  
  
   1845 - A Scot called Thomson patented a type of pneumatic tire, but  
         John Boyd Dunlop is usually given credit for their development.  
  
   1850 - A method of obtaining liquid hydrocarbons from coal and shale  
         was patented by James Young, a Scotsman. This "coal oil" took  
         the pressure off the dwindling numbers of whales which until  
         that time had been a prime source of oil for lamps.  
  
   1859 - On August 27, an ex-railroad conductor, Edwin L. Drake, made a  
         revolutionary discovery with a 69-foot well at Titusville,   
         Pennsylvania. "Rock oil" had previously been collected from   
         ground seepage pools and used for medicinal and other limited   
         purposes. With Drake's discovery on Oil Creek leading the way,   
         great volumes of petroleum became available in the United  
         States. It provided kerosene for millions of lamps, paraffin   
         for candles and candy, hoof and harness oils, lubricants for   
         ships and mills, a "miracle" salve called Vasoline, and many  
         by-products to make varnishes, lacquer, oilcloth and patent   
         leather. One of the waste products of the distilling process   
         was an explosive, inflammable substance called "gasolene."  
  
   1860 - Etienne Lenoir built and patented the first commercially  
         satisfactory gas engine. Two years later, he constructed a  
         crude vehicle on which to test his engine. Although it was  
         crude, it worked, but ran so slowly (about 1 mph), he became   
         discouraged and stopped his efforts. Lenoir's engine used an  
         electric spark plug system.  
  
   1864 - In Vienna, Austria, Siegfried Marcus built a one-cylinder  
         engine that used a primitive carburetor and a magneto arrange-  
         ment to create small explosions that applied alternating   
         pressures against the piston within the cylinder.  
  
   1872 - George Brayton of Boston patented a gasoline engine.  
  
   1874 - H. J. Lawson invented the first so-called safety bicycle, a  
         chain-driven device with two medium-sized wheels of equal  
         diameter.  
  
   1875 - Siegfried Marcus built his second gasoline-powered vehicle,  
         which is preserved in the Technical Museum in Vienna; Marcus  
         mysteriously washed his hands of the whole idea, deciding it  
         to be a waste of time.  
  
   1876 - In Deutz, Germany, Eugene Langen and Nikolaus August Otto  
         improved upon Marcus' engine and introduced the first workable  
         4-stroke internal combustion gas engine after many years of   
         experimental work. Gottlieb Daimler, an employee of Langen  
         and Otto, was involved in the engine's design.  
  
   1879 - George B. Selden, an attorney in Rochester, New York (who, at  
         the time, had never built a motor vehicle), applied for and  
         finally received U.S. patent No. 549,160 (1885)). As a result,  
         claims against automobile manufacturers clouded the industrial  
         scene for years.  
  
   1883 - In Bad Cannstatt, Germany, Wilhelm Daimler succeeded in  
         producing a more efficient, 4-stroke, gasoline-fueled engine   
         which was granted a patent. (Earlier "gas" engines had been   
         fueled by hydrogen or turpentine vapors or by coal gas.)  
         Daimler's first engine was mounted on a sturdy bicycle and  
         operated well on a test run in 1885. This is the prototype of  
         the modern motorcycle.  
  
   1885 - Carl Benz successfully tested his first gasoline engine motor  
         vehicle at Mannheim, Germany; a 1-hp, 1-cylinder engine; a  
         refinement of the 4-stroke engine which was designed by Otto.   
         This 3-wheeler had all the essential elements characteristic of   
         the modern automobile: electrical ignition, differential,   
         mechanical valves, carburetor, a water cooling system, oil and   
         grease cups for lubrication, and a braking system. He received  
         a patent for his "carriage with gas engine" in 1886. It had a   
         tubular steel chassis and an open wooden two-seater body. The   
         single front wheel steered by means of a tiller, and the two   
         large rear wheels were driven by chains. The single-cylinder   
         engine was mounted horizontally over the rear axle. At 250 to   
         300 rpm, it produced about 1/2 horsepower and drove the car at   
         about 8 to 10 mph (13-16 kph).  
  
   1887 - Building on his experience with the motorcycle, Daimler built  
         and installed his vertical single-cylinder engine into a 4-  
         wheeled, converted carriage with encouraging results. It had   
         an increased horsepower of 900 rpm (as compared to Benz's 300  
         rpm) and was the first high-speed internal combustion engine,  
         developing one and one-half horsepower.  
  
   1888 - John Boyd Dunlop introduced pneumatic bicycle tires for the  
         safety bicycles.  
  
   1892 - The Harris motor wagon, built in Baltimore, operated success-   
         fully before Duryea brothers' cars. It was a sightseeing bus  
         rather than a conventional auto and ran on hard rubber tires.  
         Maybach introduced the first float-type carburetor at this  
         time.  
  
   1893 - Charles E. and J. Frank Duryea introduced what has been  
         recognized as America's first successful internal combustion   
         horseless carriage at Springfield, Massachusetts. This vehicle,  
         called a "buggyaut" by its producers, was a well-worn, high-  
         wheeled carriage with a small, one-cylinder gasoline engine   
         mounted on its back.  
  
   1894 - Vacheron introduced the steering wheel.   
         The Michelin brothers produced a pneumatic tire for cars.  
         Edgar and Elmer Apperson celebrated the 4th of July in Kokomo,  
         Indiana, by unveiling a car they had built, based on plans  
         conceived by Elwood G. Haynes.

1895 - The Duryea brothers established the Duryea Motor Wagon 
           Company  which was the first firm in America organized 
           to make gas cars  commercially.   
           Charles R. Black had a Benz-type auto in Indianapolis and John  
           Lambert had operated a gas-mobile in Ohio. Ransom E. Olds had   
         also constructed a workable gas-burning automobile.  
         Lancaster introduced a propeller shaft transmission.  
         Mors and Daimler built a multi-cylinder (V4) engine (four in   
         line).  
  
   1896 - Henry J. Ford built an internal combustion engine from plans   
         he read in a magazine. He mounted it to a bicycle-wheeled,   
         tiller-steered two-seater, which had neither brakes nor reverse  
         gear and was so noisy it was condemned as a public nuisance.   
         Alexander Winton, a bicycle builder in Cleveland, Ohio, pro-  
         duced his first experimental car. Years later, he formed the  
         Winton Motor Carriage Company, and started to sell two-seaters  
         (one seat faced frontwards and the other faced the back).  
         In England, the "Red Flag Act" was repealed. This was cele-  
         brated by the first Emancipation Run from London to Brighton,  
         about 60 miles (96 km), which is still held annually as a  
         reliability trial for Veteran cars. (Veteran cars are those  
         built before 1918; "Vintage" cars were built between 1918 and  
         1930.)  
  
   1897 - Thomas B. Jeffery built his first experimental Rambler in a  
         machine shop of his Chicago bicycle factory.  
  
   1898 - Ford built a second motorcar which was a vast improvement over  
         his first. He persuaded a few people to back him in producing  
         it commercially, but the enterprise failed after only one  
         year.   
  
         Pioneer designers experimented with seating arrangements as  
         they did with all other details on the first cars. One of the  
         most impractical was a two-seater in which lady passengers sat  
         in the front seat to serve as windbreakers (and presumably  
         bugcatchers as well), while the gentlemen steered from the rear.  
         The ladies didn't help the driver's vision much either.  
  
   1899 - Camille Jenatzy, of France, drove a Jeantaud electric a record  
         of sixty miles an hour on April 29. The high speeds, however,  
         burned out both the specially fabricated batteries and French  
         interest in electric cars.   
         The Studebaker name had been applied to vehicles as early as  
         1852 when the products were wagons, buggies, and carriages. In  
         1899, the firm entered the auto industry as a body-maker. Three  
         years later, it produced its first car, an electric runabout.  
         The first Baker Electric was manufactured by the Baker Motor  
         Vehicle Company of Cleveland, Ohio.  
         The Akron Police Department acquired a brand-new motorized  
         wagon to speed up the business of hauling lawbreakers off to  
         jail.  
  
         B. F. Goodrich pioneered pneumatic tires for automobiles.   
         Freelan O. Stanley demonstrated the power of the Stanley Steamer   
         by driving one up Mr. Washington in New Hampshire. The following  
         year, John Brisben Walker drove another to the top of Pikes  
         Peak.   
  
         The U.S. Post Office Department bought its first motor vehicle  
         on an experimental basis. In Milwaukee, the Johnson Service  
         Company built 8 custom steamers to fulfill postal contracts  
         there.  
  
         Other innovations in 1899 were the honeycomb radiator, gate  
         gearchange, and floor-mounted accelerator (Daimler); and the  
         universal joint for shaft drive to sprung rear axles (Renault).  
  
   1901 - Ransom E. Olds became the first mass-producer of gasoline  
         automobiles with the completion of 425 curved-dash Oldsmobiles  
         in a single year. Olds instituted a system of contracting with  
         several machine shops to make required parts for him to his  
         design specifications - transmissions from one shop, steering  
         gear from another shop, carburetors from another, etc.   
         The first changes from tillers to steering wheels were made at  
         about the turn of the century.  
  
         By the early 1900s, induction coils were being used to produce  
         electrical discharges in low pressure gases, leading to the  
         discovery of x-rays and cathode rays.  
  
   1902 - The American Automobile Association was organized in Chicago  
         on March 4, symbolizing the broad interest in the new mode of  
         transportation.   
  
         The one-cylinder, 3-hp, tiller-steered model Olds with bicycle  
         type wheels and a curved dashboard sold 2,500 automobiles by   
         introducing quantity production to the industry.  
         Thomas B. Jeffery and his son, Charles T., began manufacturing  
         one-cylinder Ramblers for public sale in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  
         The first horseless carriage in Minnesota was an electric six-  
         seater (three rows of seats) with high wheels and friction   
         brakes applied to the surface of the rear tires. It had an  
         unusual bare bulb headlight.   
  
         David Dunbar Buick, a successful manufacturer of enamel bath-  
         tubs and other plumbing fixtures, ventured into the automobile  
         business. He produced his first car with the help of Walter L.  
         Marr, but his company was not successful until William Durant  
         bought it and reorganized it.   

     
   1903 - The Ford Motor Company was established in Detroit with the  
         Model A, a small, light-weight, powered by a 2-cylinder, 8-hp   
         engine which sold for $850.   
  
         The invention of demountable rims helped the tire situation   
         somewhat. It was no longer necessary to change tires at the  
         scene of a flat tire; mounted spares made it possible to make a  
         reasonably fast switch-over, but road conditions made it common   
         practice for a driver to limp home on flats or a bare rim even   
         after using a couple of spare ties.   
  
         Two Frenchmen, Georges Bouton and Count Albert de Dion, led to   
         the development of lightweight, high speed engines. Their 1903  
         "Polulaire" produced 8 hp at 1500 rpm, with a cubic capacity of  
         846 cm3 (52 in3) and a weight of only 40 lb (18 kg). To handle   
         the requirements of this high speed air cooled engine, Bouton   
         designed an ignition system that bore many similarities to the  
         modern contact breaker ignition.   
  
         The Mercedes Company (formerly Daimler) made a braking system  
         with internally-expanding shoes inside a brake drum.   
                    
   1904 - Ford added the Model B, a 4-cylinder, selling for $2,000.  
         Carl Graham Fisher and James A. Allison organized the Prest-O-  
         Lite Company and introduced a new system of acetylene gas   
         head-lights.

   1905 - Electric cars and trucks were efficient for in-city driving,  
         but drivers had to be alert to get back to garages before the  
         batteries ran down.  
  
   1906 - The Stanley Steamer, nicknamed the "Flying Teapot," clocked a  
         remarkable 127.6 miles per hour in Ormand Beach, Florida.   
         Ford added the Model K, which made that year and that car model  
         important milestones in automotive history. Ford's Model K had  
         a 40-horsepower engine and could push its 2,000-pound weight  
         up to 60 mph. It was a dismal failure to the company at $2,800   
         per car, but turned out to be the making of the Ford Company.  
         In this year, cars began to abandon their carriage look and to  
         assume a motor-age appearance.  
  
         The "Coyote," produced in California, introduced a power plant  
         very different from those of the past: a V-8 engine.   
         A very frail front bumper was the beginning of many important  
         safety devices.   
  
         The first driver's license was issued in Denver, Colorado, for  
         a cost of $1.00. Other cities required engineers' permits to  
         operate steamers which were classed as mobile boilers.   
         The Waltham (Mass.) Manufacturing Company introduced the Orient  
         buckboard for postal delivery. It had a mail case with pigeon-  
         hole compartments directly in front of the driver.  
                 
   1907 - In Seattle, Washington, John McLean, a representative of the  
         Standard Oil Company of California, opened what is claimed to  
         be the first service station in America. It consisted of an  
         old hot-water tank and a hose under a rough wooden canopy. The  
         gas was delivered into the tank by gravity.   
  
         The Automobile Gasoline Company and the Oriental Oil Company   
         opened stations in St. Louis, Missouri, and Dallas, Texas. The   
         former is credited with the first chain of automobile service   
         stations.  
  
         Within five years, Memphis, Tennessee, could boast a thirteen-   
         pump outlet, complete with a ladies' restroom and a maid who  
         served ice water to the customers. The pumps, however, were in  
         the backyard, not on the street, and the super-service was  
         ahead of its time.   
  
   1908 - The Ford Model T was unveiled for the first time. It was  
         powered by a 4-cylinder, 20 hp engine, had two forward speeds   
         and a reverse controlled by pedals. It was also equipped with   
         a throttle mounted on the steering column, and got about thirty  
         miles to a gallon of gasoline. If the purchaser requested it,   
         he could have extra-cost options of headlights, speedometer,   
         and a spare tire. Buyers could choose their cars in red, green,  
         or baby blue. Later, it could be purchased in any color the   
         buyer desired, "as-long-as-it's-black."   
  
         The automobiles of this year had air-cooled motors, since  
         there were no water-filled radiators to freeze in the winter  
         time; the passengers were usually air-cooled as well because  
         there were usually no roofs over them.   
  
         C. Harold Wills developed the use of vanadium steel for Ford.  
         Charles Y. Knight was perfecting his sleeve-valve engine.   
         The Fisher brothers founded a company which gained rapid fame  
         as a producer of closed auto bodies. The Fisher Body Company  
         was established by brothers Fred and Charles (there were five  
         other brothers).   
  
         Charles Frank Kettering of the Dayton Engineering Laboratories   
         Company helped bring about innovations in the electric starter   
         and ethyl gasoline.   
  
         Harvey S. Firestone, B. F. Goodrich, Arthur W. Grant, and many   
         others struggled to overcome tire deficiencies.  
  
         The first brakes were based on those used on the horse-drawn  
         vehicles and on bicycles. A solid block of wood, leather or  
         metal was forced against the wheel rims by a hand-operated  
         lever, or a contracting band of friction material acted upon  
         the propeller shaft in conjunction with externally-contracting  
         brakes fitted to drums on the rear wheels. In 1908, Herbert  
         Frood patented the asbestos brake linings in England. These  
         were much more effective than the cotton based linings then in  
         use.   
  
         The coil and distributor ignition was introduced, comprised of  
         a battery, contact breaker, induction coil and spark plugs.

 <PRE>					
   1909 - William A. Besserdich and his brother-in-law, Otto Zachow,  
         were young blacksmiths in Clintonville, Wisconsin, when they  
         built America's first successful four-wheel-drive motor car.  
         Their "Badger Four Wheel Drive Auto Company" was formed on  
         January 9th; later the "Badger" and "Auto" dropped from the  
         title. The firm finally switched from cars to trucks.  
  
         Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco) was founded.  
         Charles F. Kettering, a genius of the automotive industry, was  
         one of Delco's founders.   
  
   1910 - The Fisher Body Company received an order from Cadillac for  
         first quality production of closed bodies - 150 units. Curb-  
         side pumps began to appear about this time, though they were  
         forbidden by law in some communities. Custom-made ambulances  
         made an appearance in the first decade of 1900 and played a  
         major role in World War I.  
  
   1911 - By this time, the automobile industry had, for the first time,  
         securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Buick  
         Motor Company, the Olds Motor Works, the Cadillac Automobile  
         Company and the Oakland Motor Car Company had already achieved  
         success and had been combined with other firms by William  
         Crapo Durant into the General Motors Company. Durant, having  
         lost control of the company, moved into building and selling a  
         new auto, designed by and named for Louis Chevrolet, a French  
         race driver. Another manufacturer-promoter, Benjamin Briscoe,  
         had brought some 130 different companies together to form the  
         United States Motor Car Corporation. This ambitious combination  
         ran into financial difficulties and was doomed to receivership  
         in 1912.   
  
         The first production four-wheel-drive automobile, built by FWD  
         Corporation, rolled out of Clintonville, Wisc. It was first  
         used as a demonstrator, and when the firm shifted entirely to  
         truck manufacturing, it was used for nearly 35 years to haul  
         mail to and from the post office.   
  
         First four-wheel braking was employed by the Italian company  
         of Isotta-Franchini.   
  
         Other innovations were an improved electric starter, the   
         dynamo, and a car telephone.  
  
   1912 - Edward G. Budd, a young Philadelphia engineer, is credited  
         with the concept of the all-steel auto body. In 1912, he  
         convinced the Oakland and Hupmobile people to try his all-  
         steel body frames, and the next year received his first large  
         contract from John and Horace Dodge.   
  
         Charles F. Kettering introduced his greatest contribution to  
         the automotive industry, the electric self-starter.  
         Henry M. Leland introduced the self-starter in his 1912   
         Cadillac.  
  
   1913 - Dr. William M. Burton improved production of anti-knock  
         additives for gasolines, but not the firing of the larger  
         kerosene molecules mixed in with gasoline.   
         Henry Ford`s first moving assembly line revolutionized auto  
         production.   
  
         The Gulf Oil Company was the first U.S. petroleum firm to  
         distribute free road maps.   
  
   1914 - Horace and John Dodge were wealthy manufacturers of components  
         for Olds Motor Works, then for Ford Motor Company, before they   
         introduced their own automobile. The first Dodge was delivered  
         to them on November 14, 1914.   
  
         Cleveland, Ohio, installed the nation's first traffic lights.  
         At about this time, the International Harvester Auto-Wagon, a  
         high-wheeled, hard-tired pioneer version of the pickup truck,  
         appeared.   
  
         Most pioneer motorists stored their cars in the winter months,  
         due to clogged roads and operating difficulties. Anti-freeze,  
         winter oils, efficient heaters and other cold weather needs  
         were still to come.  
  
   1915 - Ernest Holmes Company of Chattanooga, Tennessee, was one of  
         the pioneers in the field of auto rescue, although the   
         mechanism of the wrecker was pretty complicated.  
  
   1916 - Studebaker instituted the "pay-as-you-ride" slogan and sold  
         automobiles on time payments.  
  
   1917 - From 1910 to 1917, company crews from B. F. Goodrich erected  
         thousands of signs on some 110,000 miles of U.S. roads. These  
         were guide posts - round metal signs on twelve-foot poles,  
         each of which gave the name of the nearest town, the next  
         large city and the ultimate destination of the route.  
  
   1918 - A German named Lankensperger took out a British patent on a  
         system of steering in which the steering wheels are separately  
         pivoted at the ends of the shaft.  
  
   1919 - The U.S. Army started its first transcontinental truck convoy.  
         Second in command of the caravan was a Lieutenant Colonel,   
         Dwight D. Eisenhower.  
  
   1920 - Jonathan Dixon Maxwell's popular automobile succumbed in the  
         mid-20s. It had spring-suspension wheels (unusual for the   
         times).   
  
         Hydraulic braking was introduced.   
         By this time, mass production methods were well-established,  
         and this led to the availability of a wide range of cheap,  
         reliable and comfortable cars which found a ready market in  
         the affluent '20s.  
  
   1921 - The U.S. Bureau of Public Roads was created right after WWI.  
         In 1921, a second Federal Highway Act more clearly defined the  
         aid program to develop a gigantic national road system.  
         The Kahn-Wadsworth Bill made possible the distribution of more  
         than 25,000 surplus army trucks and other equipment to the  
         state highway departments for road-building purposes.  
  
   1923 - Tetraethyl lead was discovered.  
  
   1924 - Walter P. Chrysler, the head of the Maxwell Motor Corporation,  
         introduced an auto bearing his name. Fred Zeder was one its  
         key designers. The Chrysler was so successful it brought about  
         the death of the Maxwell.   
  
         A California innkeeper erected the first "Motel" sign outside  
         his establishment.  
  
         General Motors and Standard Oil Company of New Jersey formed  
         Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to make and sell the new additive,  
         tetraethyl lead.  
  
   1926 - The first "Burma Shave" jingles were posted in Minnesota.  
  
   1927 - The first drive-up mail box was installed in Houston, Texas.  
  
   1929 - The short-lived Ruxton was an unusual front-wheel-drive luxury  
         automobile manufactured by New Era Motors of New York from  
         1929 to 1931. Although it did not fare well, it marked a new  
         beginning in the automotive age.

  <PRE>					
   1920-1940 - The main components of the cars were well designed and  
         efficient, and a variety of accessories were introduced, such  
         as reversing lights, radios, automatic chokes, windshield  
         wipers, and chrome-plated trim.   
  
         Since World War II, most commercial vehicles are fitted with  
         the magnetic speedometer, which was originally developed in  
         the 1920s.  
  
         Tires, until the 1920s, were of narrow cross-section and ran  
         at relatively high air pressures. As technology improved tires  
         and they were made wider, they operated at lower pressures. The  
         tire alone would not provide much comfort, however. Between  
         the wheel and the body of the car it is necessary to have  
         springs. Some carriages had had the body suspended by straps  
         from the chassis ends, but the semi-elliptical multi-leaf  
         spring was an early development. Leaf springs are still widely  
         used on cars, especially on the rear axles. Early "shocks"  
         were of the friction type, often consisting of a simple  
         pivoted arm attached to the axle so that its movement turned  
         friction discs like a clutch.  
  
         Between WWI and WWII, several very high quality cars were  
         built, and some of these represented such an exceptionally  
         high standard of craftsmanship and durability that, owing to  
         changing economic circumstances, it is unlikely that cars of  
         comparable quality will ever be built again. These include  
         such classics as the Bugatti "Royale," Hispano-Suiza, Rolls-  
         Royce "Phantom III," Bentley 8 litre, and the Delage.  
         In America the trend was to power and luxury, while European   
         manufacturers concentrated on small, low-priced cars like the   
         Austin 7 in England, and the Italian Fiat 500.   
  
         In Germany the KDF, which was to become better known as the   
         Volkswagen, was designed by Ferinand Porsche with the backing  
         of Adolf Hitler. KDF stands for "Kraft durch Freude," that is,  
         "strength through joy". Its basic shape still remains today and  
         over 12 million have been sold.  
  
         In 1939, Connecticut instituted "vanity tags" for a premium  
         fee.  
  
   1940-1960 - During WWII the production of private cars was severely  
         restricted as raw materials were diverted to military uses.  
         Factories were used to make military vehicles, ammunition and   
         air-craft components. When car production began again, the   
         first models were almost the same as pre-war designs, and it  
         took a few years for the plants to re-tool enough to produce  
         any really new designs.   
  
         Power brakes were gradually introduced on road vehicles from  
         the 1940s on.   
  
         Shock absorbers became hydraulic and telescopic, consisting of  
         a piston inside a sealed cylinder, one attached to the chassis  
         and the other to the axle.  
  
         Many new models had powerful high compression engines, along   
         with independent front suspension. In styling, they became  
         much longer, lower and more elaborate. Lightweight chassis-  
         less bodies were adopted, and the use of curved glass for the   
         windshields and rear windows improved driving visibility a  
         great deal.  
  
         Development of transistors during the 1950s led to the  
         introduction of semiconductor ignition systems, which use  
         electronic switching systems to control the ignition coil.  
         There was a large, sometimes excessive, use of chrome plating,   
         and styling became one of the major preoccupations of the  
         industry, with newer models being introduced yearly that were  
         often mechanical images of those they replaced.  
  
         The tubeless tire was introduced by the Goodrich Company in   
         1948.   
  
         Power steering, air conditioning, twin headlamps, and wrap-  
         around windshields were originated in the States during the   
         early 1950s.   
  
         Glass fiber reinforced resins, light and corrosion free, were   
         used on the bodywork of the 1953 Chevrolet Corvette, and for   
         the roof panel of the 1955 Citroen DS19.   
  
         Advances in technology allowed the use of higher compression   
         ratios in fuel. Overhead valve and overhead camshaft designs,   
         with improved fuel systems (including fuel injection) along  
         with better ignition system performance contributed to engine  
         power outputs for a given cubic capacity being increased. The   
         resultant increase in power to weight ratio that was possible   
         improved the acceleration, speed, road holding and braking of   
         cars of that time.   
  
         Disc brakes, less prone to failure from overheating than drum  
         brakes, at last became widely accepted, over half a century   
         after Lanchester's original design was patented.  
         Further improvements in roadholding and braking resulted from  
         the introduction of radial-ply tires in 1953. Due to their  
         higher cost, these tires were at first used only on expensive  
         high performance cars, but they are now widely used on all  
         kinds of cars.   
         The introduction of new plastic materials for interior trim   
         was a great asset for the stylists, and a wide range of color   
         schemes became available to match the body colors.  
         The once universal oil pressure gauges and ammeters were often   
         replaced by simple warning lights, which are cheaper and less   
         complicated; they are also less informative.  
  
   1960 - Car design in the 1960s was greatly influenced by the new  
         interest in safety and pollution control. Mechanical improve-  
         ments brought higher speeds, better road-holding, braking and  
         acceleration, but many countries began to introduce laws which  
         restricted the maximum speed of vehicles. Cars had to be built  
         to comply with the strict new safety and anti-pollution laws  
         of the United States, which were gradually adopted by many  
         other countries.   
         In addition to improved performance, cars became even more   
         comfortable and easier to drive.   
         Heating and ventilating equipment became standard on even the   
         small cheap cars where it had previously been available, if at   
         all, as an extra.  
  
         Automatic transmission, power brakes and power steering gained  
         widespread acceptance. The electrical system, which had a more  
         and more heavy load to handle, was improved by the introduction  
         of the alternator to replace the dynamo, and the use of circuit   
         breakers instead of fuses.  
  
         One important development in engine design was the invention of   
         the wankel engine, which has a single three-lobed driving rotor  
         instead of the conventional pistons and crankshaft. The first  
         one was made in 1957 by Felix Wankel of Germany, and in 1964,  
         the NSU company brought out the Wankel-engined "Spyder," and a  
         few years later, the R080. The prototype Mercedes C111 and   
         several Japanese Mazda cars also have had Wankel engines, that   
         are light, compact, powerful and smooth running.   
  
   1973 - The United Stated passed the Clean Air Act (which was amended  
         several times since), with the immediate result of forcing  
         cars to install positive crankcase ventilation.  
  
   1974 - The nation-wide 55-mph speed-limit became "permanent" in  
         America.  
  
   1975 - The catalytic converter was adopted for most 1975 American  
         cars and many imports as a means to fight fuel consumption.  
         Computers play an important role in car construction now, as  
         in everything else. The purchasing department is in charge of  
         making sure that the glass, rubber, steel and everything else  
         is on hand in the required amounts, and computers keep track  
         of it all. The computer also schedules the construction of  
         each car, and prints a sticker which goes on it, specifying  
         the trim, optional accessories, and even where the car is to  
         be shipped when it is finished.  
  
         In this age of the computer, it is only natural for automobile  
         manufacturers to install on-board computers into the cars. It   
         is, after all, the only practical method of monitoring all the   
         engine variables at once. The on-board computer receives its   
         information from the various sensors located near or on the  
         engine and processes the signals to adjust the fuel mixture,   
         timing and other elements. The process is continuous as long  
         as the engine is running.   
  
         The modern electro-mechanical carburetor is controlled by the  
         computer as well. The fuel mixture is controlled by an oxygen  
         feedback solenoid, located within the carburetor. The computer  
         can control the speed of the car and determine when something  
         is wrong. When the engine is cold, the computer operates from  
         some predetermined values and the fuel mixture is fixed at  
         full rich.   
  
         The car will let us know about any unacceptable feedback, from  
         the seat belts being unfastened to the key being left in the  
         lock.

  <P><B>Interested in car racing? Here are a few facts concerning the Indy  
   500 Race: </B>
  
  <P> The Indianapolis 500 is the original 500-mile auto race, predating  
   any other existing 500 by nearly fifty years. It's not only the most  
   famous race in America, but is the most celebrated around the world.  
   The Indy 500 was first run in 1911.  
  
  <P> The distance around one lap of the Indianapolis course is two and  
   one-half miles per lap.  
  
 <P>  It takes a driver forty seconds to negotiate one full lap at a speed  
   of exactly 225 miles per hour.  
  
 <P>  Traditionally, thirty-three cars start in the 500.  
  
  <P> The Speedway was nicknamed "The Brickyard," because the track was  
   once paved with bricks.  
  
 <P>  For more than fifty years, the winning driver has pulled into Victory  
   Lane and taken a drink of milk.  
  
   <P>The Indianapolis Motor Speedway is not located in Indianapolis. It's  
   in Speedway, Indiana, a community incorporated in 1926, with its own  
   town board, police and fire departments, schools systems, and water  
   company.  
  
  <P> An effective Indy pit stop (to pump forty gallons of fuel, change  
   four wheels, and many any minor adjustment) takes about fifteen  
   seconds.  
  
  <P> Indy cars do not run on gasoline. Since 1964, they've used methanol,  
   a wood-based alcohol.  
  
 <P>  If an Indy Car engine were installed in the average riding lawn  
   mower, it could cut a half-acre lawn in about 5.6 seconds.  
  
  <P> The winning time at the 1990 Indy was more than four hours faster  
   than the 1911 Indy's winning time of six hours, forty-two minutes.  
  
 <P>  At 200 miles per hour, an Indy driver can cover the length of a  
   football field in less than one second.  
  
 <P>  While eight different drivers named Jones have driven in at least one  
   500 race (none of which are related), no starting field has ever  
   included a driver named Smith.  
  
 <P>  Buddy Lazier was eliminated after only one lap in the 1991 Indy and  
   received $162,690 in prize money. Ernie Ansterberg, on the other  
   hand, pulled out after two laps in 1924 and was awarded the hefty sum  
   of $5.25.  
  
  <P> At 224 miles per hour, an Indy Car is traveling about 100 miles  
   faster than an average Air Force fighter jet at takeoff.
